### Secretary of the Navy Knox Declares: US Determined to Defend Overseas Territories, Aid Western Hemisphere Nations in Expanding Armaments, Part of Fleet to Tour Australia and Singapore

Washington - Secretary of the Navy Knox stated here yesterday that the US Navy is prepared to defend any territory in the world flying the American flag. Secretary Knox believes that assisting other Western Hemisphere nations in expanding their armaments is America's "moral obligation." He declared that the Navy Department has shipped cannons and equipment to several countries, but no US warships have yet been sent to any South American country. Secretary Knox stated, "We cannot neglect the security of any land under the American flag." Knox made this statement in response to inquiries about the Navy Department's intentions regarding the defense of the Philippines and other overseas US territories such as Guam, Midway Island, and Wake Island. Secretary Knox declared, "As long as the flag flies over these territories, the Navy Department must be prepared to defend them." Knox believes the Navy Department is currently planning to strengthen the US Asiatic Fleet. He added that there are no plans to increase naval construction in Cavite and the Philippines. When asked if the Navy Department planned to send reinforcements to the Philippines, Secretary Knox replied in the affirmative. Secretary Knox also stated that the rumors of the US fleet concentrating in Guam were "completely false." As for whether the Navy Department believes the Philippines would be defensible in the event of a war in the Far East, he declined to discuss it, saying that discussing strategy is useless, and stating that the US should defend the Philippines and other US territories. He declined to discuss the rumored transfers of high-ranking Navy Department officials. He stated that the Navy Department currently has no plans to send part of the US fleet on a "goodwill tour" to Australia or Singapore. Observers believe that Knox's remarks imply that part of the US fleet may tour Australia or Singapore. When asked about the near future, he replied that he was "only talking about the present." He added that he had no knowledge of the rumored Navy Department storage of submarine parts in Hong Kong for use in the event of an emergency. Secretary Knox stated that the Navy Department is making very smooth progress in requisitioning merchant ships for use as fleet transports, and that at least twenty-nine ships have been obtained in the past two months.

Washington - The United States announced yesterday that it would strongly defend the Philippines as it would defend any state in its own country. The US's new "big stick" policy in the Far East can be reconfirmed by two concurrent measures: first, Secretary of the Navy Knox stated that the US fleet is prepared to meet any threat of aggression against the Philippines; second, the War Department has ordered two powerful air corps, totaling 320 men, to depart for the Philippines within thirty days. One is the 17th Pursuit Squadron, currently stationed at Selfridge Field in Michigan, and the other is the 20th Pursuit Squadron, currently stationed at Hamilton Field in California. Knox expressed the greatest confidence in the current state of the US Navy. He stated, "We can defend any place." He also indicated that the US is close to obtaining more bases in the Pacific, mostly from Britain. (International News Service dispatch, 24th)

### Two US Fighter Squadrons to Reinforce the Philippines, Philippines To Be US Far East Base

Washington - The US War Department announced last night that two fighter squadrons are now en route to the Philippines to strengthen US Far East defenses. The release of this statement came only hours after Secretary of the Navy Knox stated that the US Navy is prepared to protect any territory flying the US flag. The War Department's statement last night stated that the two fighter squadrons being sent to the Philippines will take off from Selfridge and Hamilton Fields. It is known that Selfridge Field has a total of seven squadrons of aircraft, all of which will be transferred to the Philippines in succession. Before the War Department released this statement, Philippine Resident Commissioner to Washington, Joaquin Elizalde, met with Secretary of War Henry Stimson and reiterated the Philippines' cooperation with the US to protect American interests in the Far East. Once these two aircraft squadrons arrive in the Philippines, the US air strength there will reach a new peak. Recently, the US has repeatedly decided to secretly strengthen the Philippines' air power, and there are already dozens of "flying destroyer" bombers with long-range capabilities in the area. It is believed that the decision to send two more aircraft squadrons to the Philippines is another step in Washington's "silent and swift preparation for action in the Pacific." In the past week, this preparation has included sending huge amounts of naval and land reinforcements to Hawaii and Alaska, and requisitioning large numbers of ships for transportation. Observers also point out that, according to recent news from Manila, US naval aircraft have recently gone to the Philippines in large numbers, so that local workers are temporarily unable to build airfields and barracks to accommodate the pilots and aircraft. Air Force headquarters last night declined to disclose the size of the two aircraft squadrons being sent to the Philippines, but said it was roughly the same as the standard size. It was also learned that Elizalde, during his meeting with Secretary of War Stimson, conveyed President Quezon's promise to cooperate with the US in Far East defense to the US Secretary of War. It is believed that the two men discussed the entire Far East situation in detail, including defense issues. It is said that Elizalde stated that the Philippines has 150,000 trained soldiers available for deployment, and that the US's recent shipment of military supplies to the Philippines is based on the US's recognition that Filipino soldiers are part of the US military in that area. It is believed that the nature of the Philippine representative's meeting with the US Secretary of War is roughly the same as the meeting between US representatives and Philippine defense leaders in the Philippines. According to non-official American military observers, the events of the past week indicate that the US has decided to use the Philippines as a base for US Far East defense. The squadron being transferred from Selfridge Field will depart from San Francisco for Manila on November 20, and the squadron being transferred from Hamilton Field will depart from San Francisco by the end of this month. At the same time, military officials stated here last night that the US defense of the Philippines is not to protect the Filipinos, but to defend the US's important Far East interests. It is said that US authorities rarely discuss actual defense issues with Philippine authorities. (Associated Press dispatch, 24th)

### Entire Western Hemisphere Facing Serious Crisis: Under Secretary of State Welles Urges All Americans to Prepare for Sacrifice

Baltimore - US Under Secretary of State Welles stated here yesterday that the entire Western Hemisphere is now in grave danger and must be prepared to make the sacrifices necessary for the common good. He reiterated the US government's Good Neighbor Policy of the past eighty years, saying that the complete unity of the Western Hemisphere is the most important thing in history. He stated that the US's Good Neighbor Policy is based on the faithful friendship between the twenty-one republics of North and South America, and that these policies should make it a strong line of defense in the world crisis, and he emphasized that there should be close economic cooperation among the countries of the Western Hemisphere. He believes that the $500 million Export-Import Bank loan is sufficient to enhance the general situation of this cooperation, and stated that US experts are studying the appropriate rubber production so that it will not be necessary to rely on Malaya in the future, and that the government is also striving to plan to increase the production of quinine, ramie, manganese ore, tin ore, and chromite in the Western Hemisphere. Welles said that today, the thoughts and abilities of the US government and people are concentrated on the effective solution of appropriate national defense issues, a situation that is unprecedented. The people of the country should believe that the security of the US has not yet been definitively guaranteed. In order for the US to maintain peace forever, the US should have greater power to deter aggression. In order for US defense to be effective, the implementation of defense cannot be limited to the US mainland, but must enable the US to repel aggression in any part of the New World. If the land of the US's neighbors is not safe, then the safety of the Panama Canal is difficult to maintain, and our country cannot avoid air raids by aggressors. If the US does not have the friendship and cooperation of other countries in the Americas, then plans to defend the Panama Canal, etc., will be difficult to achieve. These facts have become increasingly clear in recent years. "What I want to say today is that this kind of factor is necessary in our country's defense capabilities, in other words, the relationship between us and Pan-Americanism. Eight years ago, governments were making their best efforts to engage in the construction of this Pan-American relationship, and the reason why they did so was because the government had long ago realized that the tragedy of today would occur in the world, and believed that in a world with armed aggression and social revolution, in a world where international law and international morality were about to collapse, one of the great plans to defend our country's peace and security was to establish this kind of relationship with the other twenty republics of the Western Hemisphere, in order to build a strong line of defense in dangerous times. If the situation of the decades leading up to 1933 existed today, then the American people may have encountered the current danger, the New World must have been divided into many parts, and would not have given faith to the US, the Western Hemisphere continent must have suffered from chaos, and if the region, due to extreme economic panic, there was social unrest, it would have lost its track. In a chaos, how could the special commissioners of those omnipotent countries not engage in "fishing in troubled waters"? But today, the understanding and mutual trust between the countries of the Americas have become clear, and have not reached the above-mentioned situation. In the past eight years, the American republics, either through formal agreements or through mutual tacit understanding, have worked hard to achieve the following basic agreements: (1) Each country mutually recognizes each other's sovereignty, equal rights, and inviolability, so that each country constitutes an equal member of the American national society. (2) To resolve disputes that may arise between each other by stipulating agreements on peaceful negotiations, mediation, and arbitration. (3) To jointly decide on matters that threaten the peace, stability, and territorial integrity of any country. (4) Cooperate fully to the extent of each country's capabilities, and in any

### The Nature of Germany's Terms to France

"France will hand over Vietnam to Japan" – this is one of the seven conditions for peace that Reuters reported yesterday that Germany and Italy recently proposed to the Vichy authorities in France. In addition, one condition is for France to hand over the remaining navy and air force to be dispatched by Germany and Italy. There are also five other conditions related to France's territories and colonies, either ceded, jointly administered, or jointly operated. It is said that if France accepts these conditions and cooperates with Germany and Italy to declare war on Britain, then Germany will immediately return part of the militarily occupied areas to the jurisdiction of the Vichy government. It is also said that after Germany and Italy defeat Britain, when they divide up Britain, they will allow France to share a portion. It is also said that Deputy Prime Minister Laval, Foreign Minister Baudouin, and Naval Minister Darlan in the Vichy organization agree with this approach. Laval is currently traveling between the Vichy authorities and the German authorities in Paris, attempting to bring it about. It is also said that Vichy head of state Pétain, Minister of National Defense Weygand, and others, considering the content of these conditions, believe that the situation Laval wants to bring about will cause France to disintegrate, so they intend to firmly reject these conditions. Under the heavens, all free peoples and republican citizens who cherish freedom and the republican system, and who have any regard for France, where this right and this system originated, are now encountering extreme internal and external adversity, causing the country's fate to plummet to this extreme, will undoubtedly sigh and be heartbroken for it. Although, it is said that this kind of encounter is not a sudden and unexpected cruelty; for Laval, Baudouin, and others, and even Pétain, Weygand, and others, initially shrinking their determination to resist, undermining the public's will to resist, abandoning the weapons of resistance, and alienating the countries allied in the resistance, unconditionally yielding to the enemy, in order to seek so-called glorious cessation of hostilities, then any harsh conditions were all expected. It can be said that it was the case from the beginning, and not cruel today. Although it is said that a partial cession under harsh conditions is still better than unconditional destruction. And although Pétain and Weygand seem to be one better than the Laval types today, but from being cowardly and contradictory and disjointed, how can it be seen that they are slightly better than the Laval types' thoroughness? At the same time, it has been widely rumored that Laval will succeed Pétain as the Vichy head of state. However, we absolutely do not believe that the French culture, material, historical, realistic, and even future prospects, everything, are fatefully destined to only be a dowry for Laval! Could we not view it this way: that France, whether it is Pétain's or Laval's, whether it is German or French, has nothing to do with us. It seems that there is no need to sigh and be heartbroken for it. What we do not believe can also be unexamined. However, feelings and thoughts must be unable to be restrained by those with souls. Moreover, how France's fate will be, is still uncertain, and its rise and fall, survival and death, are related to the world elsewhere, so how can it be ignored? And the fact that Germany and Italy are now, rather than sooner, talking about conditions with France, and that among the seven conditions is "France will hand over Vietnam to Japan," provides important reference material for those who care about world affairs. Since the start of the war, Germany has been victorious in the east, north, and west, and can be said to have won every battle and conquered every fortress. And France's seeking cessation of hostilities under unconditional terms has further contributed to Germany's momentum. Now should be the time for Germany to do as it pleases and carry out its grand ideals. Why, at this time, does it suddenly present conditions to France? Why does it want to determine the entire relationship between Germany and France through partial cession? Why does it want to divide up France's territories and give them to Spain and Japan, saying that it is being generous to others when it is actually what they gained through bloody battles? Why does it give the conquered generals a share of the spoils in the form of IOUs? All these questions, other than seeing it as Germany having realized that it only has Italy as its partner, which is not enough to contend for supremacy, not enough to lead and create the so-called New European Order, so that Spain, which has been in civil strife for years and whose wounds have not yet healed, and the Vichy regime, which is decadent and scattered and clings to the past, and Japan, which is deeply mired and unable to extricate itself, are all on the lookout; in short, in the past, they were confident that they had the power of thunder and lightning and did not see the whole picture, but now they have no choice but to concede even small things. There is no other possible answer to the question. This answer explains how the strengths of the two sides are waning and waxing in the entire international situation and the entire war situation. This waxing and waning must be noted by those who care about world affairs, and this waxing and waning must be a source of joy for anti-aggressionists. As for "France will hand over Vietnam to Japan," on the surface, it is one of the conditions that Germany has only presented today, and that France has not yet accepted. However, Germany and Japan must have exchanged conditions for collusion before allying, and will never complete the deal before negotiating the price. In other words, Germany had already handed over Vietnam to Japan on behalf of France, and does not need to discuss it with France today. Tomorrow, it will wait for France to accept it before handing over and ceding it. It can be seen that what Germany presents to France is actually an order that cannot be disobeyed, at least the one condition regarding Vietnam is an order. In that case, Laval, who is currently traveling, and Pétain and Weygand, who still intend to firmly reject the conditions, are only supporting characters in the drama, or "fools" who are kept in the dark. And all the comings and goings around Haiphong and Hanoi, all the forms of meetings, and the tone of consultation, are only a posture of clever coercion and plunder, only a twist in the plot before the handover and cession. French patriots who are concerned about the times, for the sake of Vietnam, know their best, still want to protect one point, but do not know that they are spiraling between Vichy and Paris, and do not know how to jump out of the pot, and this is the most sighing and heartbreaking.

Non-American countries or any non-Asian countries groups, to use force, economic pressure, or other methods, if there is an attempt in any part of the Western Hemisphere is also based on full respect for each country's freedom of choice as a principle, and start cooperate, (5) jointly decide on close cooperation with each other, so that the American democratic system, can not be overthrown by any overseas activities, (6) in the economic, commercial and financial range, to reduce all excessive and artificial trade barriers, and with in the possible scope, from the practical promotion of non-discriminatory policies and facilities, in order to increase investment opportunities and import and export trade volume of Pan-American countries". Some six kinds of basic agreement on principles, eight years ago they still think of as an ideal, that is the record of the past journey too, Guan Ping this kind of New World countries understanding, know that appropriate and other continents to military economic control over everything "New Order" completely opposite, cover this kind of principles, is the joint of each free and independent country, does not constitute a threat to any country also this kind of understanding, there is no aggressive policy or domination of enterprises, nor contains the use of economic means, in order to obtain political hegemony factors, fundamentally this is a friendship joint which twenty-one Republics freely joined, are prepared to trade on the conditions of equal opportunities, but each other fork united as one, in order to maintain the independence and freedom of the New World rights, not say that the president has implemented the Good Neighbor Policy, is a friendly, construction of new cooperation procedures, and is based on the implementation, not merely the empty talk also, when dangerous times, all those in the Western Hemisphere, shall be prepared for the public interest and sacrifice necessary, not only the American government, that is, every American people, should be prepared to maintain, and continue to increase the basis of cooperation of American countries which has gradually grown for eight years, (Havas dispatch, 24th)

### Hendaye, a Town on the Franco-Spanish Border; Heads of Germany and Spain Meet; The Meeting Lasted Two Hours and Both Foreign Ministers Participated; Spain and France Join the Axis Powers

Hendaye. Hendaye is a picturesque town located at the mouth of the Bidassoa River. The German head of state, Hitler, yesterday conducted a meeting here with General Franco, the leader of Spain. Hitler's special train arrived at the Hendaye station first, and Franco's special train arrived shortly after. Hitler, accompanied by Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, disembarked, followed by General Brauchitsch, Commander-in-Chief of the Army, and General Keitel, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces. They inspected the guard of honor and a battalion of the Spanish Army in front of the station. The station was decorated with German and Spanish flags. A few minutes later, Franco's special train pulled into the station platform, and the military band played the Spanish national anthem. The guard of honor presented arms. General Franco, accompanied by Foreign Minister Suñer and General Moscardó, the defender of the Alcázar, arrived at the same time. The two leaders exchanged greetings, and Hitler introduced his accompanying officials to Franco. They then proceeded to inspect the guard of honor. Hitler then led General Franco into a specially prepared conference car for a two-hour meeting, which was also attended by the German and Spanish foreign ministers. In the evening, General Franco hosted a banquet. It is expected that the meeting concluded late last night. (Haitong dispatch of the 24th)

Berlin. Regarding the outcome of the meeting between Hitler and Franco in Hendaye last night, this agency has received the following additional information. Last night, Franco accepted Hitler's invitation to dinner in his train. Key German and Spanish figures participated. After the discussions, Hitler and Franco reviewed the guard of honor again. Then, Hitler escorted his guest to the door of the special train to say goodbye. As Franco's train left the station, the military band played the Spanish national anthem. (Haitong dispatch of the 24th)

Berlin. This morning's German newspapers only published brief official reports and supplementary notes on the meeting between Hitler and Franco, and some morning newspapers did not even publish this important news. Only the Völkischer Beobachter and the Berliner Börsen-Zeitung published the official report and pointed out the significance of the Hitler-Franco meeting on the front page, but without further comment, only urging the German people to pay attention to this important meeting. (Haitong dispatch of the 24th)

Madrid. Last night, the German leader Hitler and General Franco held a meeting on the Franco-Spanish border in order to quickly bring France and Spain into the Axis powers and control the western Mediterranean and Northwest Africa. Some believe that this important meeting of the two dictators will bring about an unexpected turning point in the European war. Some believe that this move may involve "plundering France," that is, occupying Gibraltar and preventing the Allies from entering the Mediterranean from the west. (International dispatch of the 24th)

Madrid. People in Madrid were discussing the Hitler-Laval meeting last night. Madrid newspapers prominently published this important news this morning, and evening newspapers reported on the meeting on the front page. All newspapers headlined the French official report as "a major event since the Franco-German armistice." The Pueblo newspaper commented, "A major political and military event after the Brenner Pass meeting has begun to be announced. The new situation created by Britain's attitude towards France, Britain's desire to expand the conflict, and the justifiable desire to attack the German Empire has become a topic of discussion among international figures. In short, the new events and dangers that should occur during the war against Britain have arrived." (Haitong dispatch of the 24th)

New York. The New York Times' Berlin correspondent reports that the German newspapers are not allowed to publish a single word about the Hitler-Franco meeting beyond what is stated in the communiqué. However, neutral diplomats in Berlin believe that the importance of the current diplomatic changes has exceeded the importance of attacking Britain, and the military center has now shifted to the Mediterranean, making the attack on Britain a secondary goal.

Hitler Hopes Spain

Will Abandon its Policy of Non-Intervention

London. A Reuters correspondent reports that London is not surprised by the news that Hitler and Foreign Minister Ribbentrop have arrived on the Franco-Spanish border to meet with Franco and Spanish Foreign Minister Suñer, and considers this to be another trick by the Germans. Originally, the Germans wanted to discuss political matters during Suñer's vacation in Germany, but this was not kept secret and was revealed early. Suñer kept his scheduled vacation dates, returning home after the vacation was over. Thus, he could only discuss internal affairs and inspect the Nazi system during his travels, but did not have time to represent the government in discussing political matters. The Germans were, of course, annoyed by this. The Germans clearly intend to make Spain more closely aligned with the Axis powers, and still hope to discuss this matter with Spain. This is proven by Hitler's visit to the Franco-Spanish border. Hitler may believe that his personal and direct contact with Franco will eliminate the difficulties previously encountered by his foreign ministers, and that Franco will be moved by his personal visit and will no longer insist on the non-intervention policy that best suits Spain's true interests. To achieve this goal, Hitler did not hesitate to abandon his usual practice of summoning politicians from other countries and risked a long journey and damage to his dignity if he failed. (Reuters dispatch of the 24th)

Spain's Future Mission

Is to Appeal to South America

Berlin. Informed German sources today suggested that after the Hitler-Franco meeting in Hendaye, Spain and France are being rapidly brought into the Axis group as non-belligerent countries. They also hold the view that Spain's mission and purpose in the Axis powers' "New Order" plan will be clarified, and after clarification, they can appeal to the Portuguese-speaking countries of South America, giving the United States a new warning not to "unnecessarily support a defeated Britain." (International dispatch of the 24th)

### Hitler Prepares for

A Meeting with Pétain; It Is Reported that Germany Proposed to Laval

The Cession of Northern Morocco to Spain

Vichy. According to Italian newspaper reports, Italian Foreign Minister Ciano is preparing to go abroad on a secret mission, but it is not clear whether he will meet with Laval. Observers believe that Laval's meeting with Hitler is entirely preparatory, with Hitler expressing his willingness to meet with Pétain. It is reported that one of the topics discussed by the two leaders will be the issue of ending the state of war between the two countries. It is said that the release of 1.8 million French prisoners was among the subjects discussed by Laval and Hitler. It is reported that the meeting between Laval, Hitler, Ribbentrop, and Pétain was at Hitler's invitation and would be held as soon as possible after the talks between Hitler and Laval. In a statement to the Associated Press reporter, French Foreign Minister Baudouin stated, "I believe that France plans to declare war on Britain." He said, "I authorize you to issue a statement that the intention of French military action was not included in the meeting between Laval and Hitler." The statement was issued after Baudouin's meeting with Marshal Pétain, because rumors were circulating that the meeting between Laval, Hitler, and Ribbentrop was Hitler's request for the French fleet to join the war against Britain. (Associated Press dispatch of the 24th)

Vichy. Hitler's far-reaching proposals for the range outlined in Europe and the Mediterranean bring today's France closer to the moment of her fate. The leaders of this conquered country discussed Nazi peace terms until late last night. Marshal Pétain, the veteran of the World War known as the "Verdun Meuse," now the Prime Minister of the defeated country, may be about to meet Hitler in person. (International Press dispatch of the 24th)

Madrid. According to the Zürich newspaper Volksrecht, Germany proposed to French Deputy Prime Minister Laval that France cede French Morocco north of the Spanish zone to be used for an offensive against Gibraltar. This is receiving close attention here. The Zurich newspaper also said that the Nazi plan caused a serious split in the Vichy government. French Prime Minister Pétain and most people oppose the German demands, while Deputy Prime Minister Laval, Foreign Minister Baudouin, and Naval Minister Darlan support Hitler's peace plan. It is said that General Weygand, the commander of French defense in Morocco, is also among the opponents. The immediate participation of France and Spain in the European war seems to be rapidly approaching. Hitler will personally command the Axis powers to attack southwestern Europe after the German army enters Romania and advances from east to west. (International dispatch of the 24th)

Laval Returns to Paris Again

Vichy. After meeting with German leader Hitler, Cabinet Associate Laval returned here this afternoon and immediately met with leader Pétain to report on the proceedings. He then hurriedly left for Paris. Various circles here are commenting on this. It has been rumored that these things happened three days ago, but officials have not made any indications. Although the responsible parties are still keeping silent, they also admit that this matter is very important regarding the "future of France". Regarding the various reports published in foreign newspapers, they are undoubtedly confirmed, but the responsible parties point out that some of the news are groundless rumours, and advise the public not to make rash speculations. In short, the talks between Associate Laval and leader Hitler are based on the fundamental concept of Franco-German cooperation, but what the two discussed is still unknown. In addition, Foreign Minister Baudouin yesterday made a statement to American journalists that the hatred between France and Germany must be eliminated. Although this statement is based on Pétain's recent letter to the French people, it has nothing to do with the travels of Associate Laval, but it is enough to express the direction of France's current policies. (Havas dispatch of the 24th)

American Reporters Are Warned

Rome. The semi-official Stefani News Agency has issued a dispatch from Berlin stating that American newspaper reporters stationed in Germany have been issuing news on the meeting between German leader Hitler and French Cabinet Associate Laval, making various guesses about the content of the talks. German officials consider it to be "a kind of political espionage" and have issued a warning to them, telling them not to think of themselves as "observers of the enemy of the Axis powers." (Havas dispatch of the 23rd)

Report of an Agreement Between Germany and France

Geneva. According to Swiss news today, an agreement was reached after the meeting between German leader Hitler and French Deputy Prime Minister Laval. According to this agreement, France should allow Germany to establish air bases in its colonies in the Atlantic, as well as in the ports of Casablanca and Dakar. (International dispatch of the 24th)

Political Offensive by the Axis Powers

Zurich. The Basel newspaper in Switzerland last night sent a correspondent from Berlin reporting another reason for the meeting between Hitler and Laval. It is said that this meeting is a major political offensive by the Axis powers to make it impossible for the United States to participate in the war before the US presidential election. German newspapers are now using the same means to induce Spain, believing that if France can be induced to join the German side in the war, Spain will have no choice but to stay out of it. Therefore, something must happen before the US presidential election to ensure that the US cannot participate. (Reuters dispatch of the 24th)

### British Secretary of War

Cancels Visit to Turkey

Istanbul. The British Embassy in Turkey announced that British Secretary of War Eden will not visit Turkey. Political figures here believe that this statement is a sign that Britain has abandoned its plan to persuade Turkey to adopt a pro-British attitude. (Haitong dispatch of the 24th)

Istanbul. Regarding Turkey's determination not to be threatened, newspapers and radio commentators are now commenting. An authoritative writer, Sadik, said in the Ankara Newspaper today, "We don't know what the word threat means. As for the so-called new order, there is no fear at all." Another powerful writer, Anfkan, also said, "Those who try to enter our country to achieve their goals will suffer serious losses. This is the position of the Turkish people and cannot be decided by the government." The semi-official Ankara newspaper Ulas also wrote, warning, "Turkey is now in a dark, uncertain dispute in the world, which may one day cause us to bear great hardship, but the more difficult things are, the more determined our determination is, and all our courage will enable us to complete our cause." (Associated Press dispatch of the 24th)

### 羅斯福　競選演說

Philadelphia Yesterday, President Roosevelt delivered his first primary election speech here, reaffirming his promise to ensure that the United States does not participate in foreign wars. He also denounced the Republican Party's use of dictatorial methods in an attempt to make him fail in the election. He stated that he felt the time had come to respond to the Republican accusations. For several years, every action, every thought of mine, has been aimed at maintaining world peace, and I have strived even more for the peace of the United States and the Western Hemisphere. Whenever war seemed imminent, I have not hesitated to use every ounce of power of the President of the United States to avoid war. And when war has started, I have exhausted all my efforts to prevent its spread and to strengthen national defense for my own country. All of these are the best guarantees of peace and security. I finally declare that I stand on my own position, and we will not participate in foreign wars unless attacked by others, nor will we spare any effort of the army and air force in combat. What I have always strived for is peace. Only for peace will I dedicate myself to the utmost until death. (United Press, 24th)

### 英德空軍活動漸和緩　少數德機襲倫敦未逞　英機羣續炸柏林等處

London After a relatively quiet night, Londoners were awakened again this morning at 5 a.m. by the sound of anti-aircraft fire and sharp alarms, forcing them to take refuge in air-raid shelters, the 251st time they had sought shelter since the start of the war. Last night's German air raid began at 7 p.m. This raid was the earliest that the Germans had tried to attack London in the 17 consecutive days of attacks. The number of planes seemed to be fewer than usual, perhaps due to bad weather. German planes attempted to break through the London defense line from two locations, but were repelled by British anti-aircraft fire. A lone Nazi plane cut off its engine and glided in the darkness, attempting to penetrate the heart of London. This lone night hawk dropped two bombs and then escaped. The air-raid alarm sounded twice in London during the day. (International Telegraph, 24th)

London An Air Ministry communiqué stated that yesterday, German aerial activity was limited to a few planes carrying out individual attacks, dropping bombs on a town on the south coast and two locations in the London area. Apart from a slight number of casualties at a factory in the London area, there were no deaths or injuries elsewhere. A town in East Midlands and the Kent area were also bombed, causing damage to buildings and some deaths and injuries, although not many. (Reuters, 24th)

London According to a joint communiqué issued by the Air Ministry and the Ministry of Home Security, German planes began attacking London shortly after dusk yesterday and continued into the night, with some interruptions, but on a small scale. Buildings and shops in several locations were hit and damaged. No major damage was reported until 5:30 a.m. There were also few casualties. A town in northeastern England was bombed, damaging houses and causing some deaths and injuries. Several locations in southern Scotland were also affected, but the damage and casualties were very slight. Although enemy planes appeared elsewhere, they did not drop bombs. (Reuters, 24th)

(Reuters, 24th)

### 希特勒侵英準備　遭受嚴重打擊　英航空部發表詳情

London The government disclosed details of Hitler's preparations for the invasion of England last night. According to the Intelligence Department of the Air Ministry, only a portion of these details can be disclosed at present. From the first day that the enemy began to assemble troops at the ports and harbors they occupied, the Royal Air Force began reconnaissance. According to reconnaissance reports from British planes in early September, the number of troops and materials concentrated by the enemy was still small, but it increased day by day thereafter. Before long, hundreds of flat-bottomed boats and other war equipment were assembled in Antwerp, Calais, Dunkirk, Ostend, Nieuwpoort, and Havre. Aerial reconnaissance also revealed many flat-bottomed boats moving slowly back and forth in the canals, with small warships moving nearby. These flat-bottomed boats are self-propelled with engines, and are over 150 feet long, capable of carrying two train carriages' worth of soldiers and supplies. The Germans also emptied out five hundred-ton flat-bottomed boats and hired workers to modify the front of these ships to make it easier to load and unload tanks and artillery. In addition, submarines (including giant ocean-going submarines), giant motorboats, tugs, and merchant ships were also berthed in many ports. At one time, 45 large merchant ships were berthed in Havre harbor. In the interior, many airfields are being constructed, with new underground hangars, where aircraft will assist in the invasion of England. Railway traffic is also unusually frequent, especially railway transport between Germany and the Netherlands and Belgium. On September 5, the Royal Air Force launched a strong offensive, bombing the invasion bases one by one. The naval docks and shipyards in Kiel and Bremen in Germany were bombed, and the occupied ports along the Dutch and Belgian coasts were also attacked and severely damaged. The enemy forces in Cherbourg were suddenly attacked by the British naval and air forces a few days ago, and they were caught off guard. The coastal defenses there did not seem to be prepared to retaliate. After the British forces had finished bombing and withdrew, the enemy's heavy artillery began to fire back at the British ships. As it stands, the threat of invasion of England still exists. As long as there are warships, flat-bottomed boats, troops, and aircraft assembled along the long coastline of the occupied areas, this threat will not be eliminated for a day. Therefore, the Royal Air Force will continue to strike at the "invasion ports" whenever it deems necessary. (Reuters, 24th)

### 德軍戰報

Berlin This afternoon's German war report stated that due to inclement weather yesterday, the activities of the German air force were limited to bombing several factories in London and central England, in addition to aerial reconnaissance.

Enemy warships attempting to approach the Flanders coast under cover of heavy fog were all repelled by German coastal artillery fire. Last night, British planes flew over German territory, attempting to bomb Berlin. Only a few reached Berlin's airspace. The incendiary bombs they dropped mostly landed in residential areas. Although several fires broke out, they were quickly extinguished. One German factory was hit by a bomb, causing slight damage. One German plane is missing. (Haitong Telegraph, 24th)

### 英軍管轄　西奈半島　埃軍奉命撤退

Athens According to news from Cairo, the Egyptian Sinai Peninsula, Quqa, Dachila, Bahari, Siwa and other places were placed under the jurisdiction of the British military authorities yesterday. The Egyptian garrisons in each area have been ordered to withdraw within one week. The Cairo newspapers believe that this change in the territorial status of Egypt is only administrative in nature. In fact, placing the various regions under British military administration is tantamount to forcibly changing the constitution, because the special border administrative chiefs of each region are personally appointed by the King of Egypt. Saudi Arabia attaches great importance to this matter and believes that British motorized troops will replace the Egyptian army and be stationed in the Gulf of Aqaba. It was rumored in Cairo yesterday morning that British motorized troops had clashed with Arabs in the Outer Nile region. According to news from Alexandria, a large number of Arabs near Suez were arrested for being involved with the Pan-Arab anti-British Committee. (Haitong Telegraph, 24th)

### 溫莎公的新職

The "Lady Somers", sailing from Bermuda to the Bahamas, arrived in the capital Nassau on the morning of August 17. Apart from the Duke and Duchess of Windsor and their entourage taking up their new posts, there was only one passenger on board. At 9:15 a.m., the Duke and his party disembarked, walked down the gangplank, landed at the St. George's Wharf, passed through Rawson Square, and went to the Parliament House in Government House, where the oath of office ceremony was held. The black natives on the island were extremely excited to hear that "the King" - they did not yet know that he had abdicated - had arrived. Thousands of men, women and children, young and old, were waiting at the dock and along the route that the Duke and Duchess passed. These blacks, barefoot, cheered loudly to show their respect when they saw the Duke of Windsor and his party passing by. The lively scene was several times more lively than in Bermuda. The only thing that was the same was that the Duchess was still wearing the same dress.

From the wharf to the Parliament House, the streets were decorated with colored streamers, and the ships in the harbor were also flying flags to celebrate, and there were large welcoming banners. One of the banners read: "Columbus, 1492; Duke of Windsor, 1940." The natives' enthusiastic welcome was evident.

Three hundred people, all wearing formal attire or military uniforms, participated in the Duke of Windsor's inauguration ceremony. The weather was hot that day, and the sun was scorching. It was really hot in this tropical area. The guests were sweating, and the audience was bored. The Duke of Windsor, wearing a yellow lieutenant-general's uniform, entered the hall after his wife was seated. The Duchess's long skirt swayed, and she was dignified and graceful. She sat in a seat one level lower than the Duke of Windsor's seat, but one level higher than the seat of the previous Governor's wife. Because it was hot, she lightly fanned herself with a precious fan from time to time.

Opposite the Duchess of Windsor's seat was a huge portrait of Queen Mary of England, more than ten feet high. It was magnificent, dignified, kind and peaceful, and inspired respect. When the time for the ceremony arrived, the Duke of Windsor stood under the red canopy with the royal crown emblem, looking slightly trembling and uneasy. He then reached into his left sleeve and took out a handkerchief. At this time, Colonel Lindop recited the letter of appointment in a loud voice. This was followed by the Chief Justice Darley, wearing a wig and robe, administering the oath.

Opposite the Duke of Windsor was a huge mirror, with a snow-white ceiling above it. Windsor's every move was reflected in the mirror. At this time, he restrained his smile and looked very serious. Then, the Chief Justice read out the following oath intermittently: "I, Edward Albert Christian George Andrew Patrick David, Duke of Windsor, do solemnly swear to faithfully and sincerely serve King George and his descendants and successors according to law, so help me God." From Edward onwards, those were all the Duke of Windsor's names. It can be said that the roll call was complete.

After the oath, the Duke of Windsor signed the document with a specially made tortoise-shell pen and continued to take the oath of office. The first part was the same as the oath mentioned above, and the concluding words were: "I will serve King George with all my heart in my capacity as Governor and Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy in the Bahamas." After signing for the second time, the Duke of Windsor straightened his body, looked at his wife, and listened to the speeches of Speaker Moore and Councilor Johnson.

After the speeches, Windsor gave a reply. He did not have a written speech, but simply gave a few words that he had prepared on the ship. First, he thanked those who welcomed him and described his journey. Then, he hoped to do his best during his term of office. Finally, he said: "The Bahamas, like other British colonies, has been affected by the war and is seeking a solution to its difficulties. Regardless of how long I am in office, I will do my best to work together to find a solution. The Duchess and I are very happy to be here in this island. The warm welcome we received from the people of Nassau is something we are very grateful for. We will be living here afterwards, and there will be many opportunities for good relations, etc."

After the speech, everyone cheered three times, and then the couple began to shake hands with many white and black people in the audience. It was also a bitter task for the Duchess to shake hands with three hundred guests in the hot weather, but they smiled and enjoyed it. One of the female guests curtsied to the Duchess. Another female guest wanted to imitate her, but changed her mind and did not do so.

It was just past ten o'clock when the Duke and Duchess stood on the balcony and waved to the people to express their gratitude. At this time, the open space in front of the Governor's gate was filled with natives who came to admire the Duke and Duchess's demeanor, and they cheered loudly to show their respect. Finally, the band played the British national anthem. The Duke of Windsor raised his hand to salute in the solemn atmosphere. The inauguration ceremony was completely over, and the Duke and Duchess drove to the government residence to rest and enjoy cold drinks.

The Duchess's graceful figure was charming and moving. She was originally a beautiful woman. In addition, she was well-dressed and good at dressing herself up. In this island of Bahamas, she appeared like Chang'e descending from heaven, giving people a refreshing feeling. A few days after her husband took office, a banquet was held in the Governor's House. As the hostess, the Duchess had to dress up in gorgeous clothes to entertain the guests. However, there was no luxurious beauty salon on the island for the Duchess to use. She had to send a telegram to a French barbershop in New York, asking them to send the famous barber Folyeth to Nassau to give her a perm and makeover. The barber received the telegram and did not dare to delay. He brought a hair dryer, rouge, powder, nail polish, lipstick and other cosmetics, and flew to the Bahamas within 24 hours. This extravagant act of the Duchess is probably hard to find a second person in the world.

It has been 200 years since the Governor was established in the Bahamas, and the official residence where the Duke and Duchess of Windsor live is also an old house, which is 110 years old. A wife as fond of beauty as the Duchess would of course want to renovate the old house. Unfortunately, during this period of national crisis, all expenses cannot be abundant. The Bahamian Parliament only approved US$8,000 for the house repairs. The Duchess therefore had no choice but to proceed in an economical way. The Duchess's friend, Lady Mountail, has been ordered to work together to plan the renovation of the house.

The new Governor and his wife live in a residence built in 1801, with seven bedrooms, six bathrooms, and twenty-four other rooms. These include the Executive Council Chamber, the Private Secretary's Office, and a large ballroom. Currently, the furniture in the main living room has been repainted in rose-Queen Mary of England's favorite color. The ten-foot-high portrait of the Queen Mother in the dining room was her bridal attire when she married the late King George V. There were originally six servants in the official residence, and they remain the same. However, the new Governor and his wife will add a few more.

This official residence is quite spacious, but it is a bit old. The previous Governor had built a new house on a high ground with beautiful scenery and requested the Parliament to allow him to move the official residence in, but it was rejected. If the Duke of Windsor wants to move the official residence, I am afraid the result will be the same. Before the previous Governor, all previous Governors who requested to move or increase their salaries were rejected in the same way. Windsor's deputy, Du Lay, spent the winter in Nassau last year and has already found two villas by the beach that can be used for the Duke and Duchess to rest. In the future, the social customs of Nassau society may also change from this. (The End)

The conference has now made concrete decisions, and I hope that we will make unremitting efforts in this direction." He continued, "The convening of the National Sports Conference is truly to meet the needs of the current era of resistance and construction. I deeply hope that the people of the whole country will follow the instructions of President Jiang and pay more attention to and work harder on national sports. I also hope that the participants will return to their respective regions, taking schools as the center or agencies as the starting point, to promote national sports in all aspects." Then, Director Jin, Director of the Department of Health, and Deputy Minister Pan of the Central Propaganda Department were invited to give speeches. Finally, the chairman read the conference declaration before the meeting adjourned.

Full Text of the Declaration

A nation has three foundations: education, economy, and military. This is the path that President Chiang has instructed us to strive for in national construction, and education is one of the main links. As for the educational policy, the President has further clarified the meaning of "equal emphasis on literature and martial arts, and equal importance to both technique and ethics" to eliminate the bias of the times. We, in the education sector, should diligently uphold it and never forget it. The holding of the National Sports Conference coincides with the National Day of the fourth year of the War of Resistance, and it takes place in the accompanying capital leading the national resistance. Looking outward at the increasing spread of the world war, and inward at the approaching victory of the War of Resistance, every time we think of the President's instructions, we feel more keenly the importance of the responsibilities that we in the education sector, especially we in the sports sector, bear for the War of Resistance and national construction, and we are awed by the fact that our mission may not be fully accomplished. After careful discussion, we would like to mention the main points of the resolutions to our compatriots across the country:

I. Establish the Direction of the National Physical Fitness Implementation Plan

In ancient education, in addition to the six arts of writing, arithmetic, etc., rites, music, archery, and charioteering were all related to physical education. Indeed, if the physique is not strong, self-defense is difficult, let alone defending the country. Therefore, the implementation of national physical education should aim to enhance the physical strength of the people and realize the purpose of national education. It is essential that all citizens have the obligation to receive physical education training, and also that everyone has the right to enjoy sports. Only in this way can physical education be truly universal and democratized, and the foundation of a strong nation will be established and unshakable. Moreover, physical education is not only about enhancing the physical strength of the people, but also the result of enhancing physical education can enrich people's lives, support the survival of society, enrich the people's livelihood, and continue the life of the nation. Therefore, the implementation of national physical education is by no means aimed only at a few individuals, but in fact targets all citizens of the country at all times and in all places. In other words, it is aimed at the entire nation. We only hope that the education sector across the country, under the established direction, will adapt to the times, adapt to local conditions, adapt to people, and adapt to circumstances, strive forward, and converge on the same goal. Then, the great results can be expected.

II. Cultivate Sports Teachers and Encourage Academic Research

The advancement and expansion of sports depend on the cultivation of sports talents, and academic research is also indispensable. For a fundamental solution, the central government should plan to establish a five-year sports normal college, and each province and city should establish sports normal schools or sports normal departments to cultivate a large number of sports teachers for secondary and primary schools. At the same time, cultivate cadres for national sports. For a temporary solution, all sports colleges or sports normal schools, as well as all schools with sports departments, should, in light of the needs of national education, establish various sports training classes to alleviate the current shortage of sports talents. The state should give special encouragement to those who have special research in sports academics and have achieved definite results. All methods that can encourage research in sports, such as establishing sports research institutes, sending sports students abroad, compiling and translating sports books and newspapers, and experimenting with sports teaching materials, should be organized by the government and society to the best of their ability, so that the general public's concept of sports becomes increasingly correct and their interest in sports becomes increasingly strong. Then, the progress of national sports will surely be achieved with half the effort and twice the result.

III. Improve and Promote School Sports and Community Sports

The Ministry of Education has previously promulgated the implementation plan for sports in schools at all levels and the provisional minimum standards for sports equipment in schools at all levels. Now, in order to effectively implement it, the progress should be clearly defined and completed within a time limit, so that school sports will not become empty talk on paper. The measurement of the physique of primary and secondary school students and the testing of sports skills should also be completed as soon as possible so that they can be used as a basis. Based on scientific methods and statistical principles, sports performance scales for various sports should be formulated separately according to the age and gender of students at all levels. This is in terms of school sports. As for community sports, people in general, ordinary young men, community youth, or civil servants, etc., should be treated according to their respective characteristics and appropriate sports facilities should be determined. All schools, sports fields, or natural environments that can be used as places for the public to practice sports should be used as much as possible to achieve the universality of sports implementation. At the same time, formulate national sports performance testing standards to show role models, and use various methods to create a social atmosphere that values sports and enjoys exercise, so that the physique of the general public can reach this standard. For example, designating September 9th as National Sports Day is one way to create an atmosphere. For the purpose of observation and research, a central sports and health museum should be established to collect specimens, materials, statistical charts, etc. related to sports and health, so that the people of the country can know where our physical shortcomings lie, and work together to transform them to achieve progress. This is most important to national sports, and we hope to strive for its realization with all our strength.

IV. Improve Health Education, Traditional Chinese Martial Arts Education, and Scouting Education

Sports and hygiene are essentially one, so when talking about sports, we must pay attention to health education. In terms of organization, the central government's competent authority for health education was originally the Ministry of Education, supplemented by the Ministry of Health. The administration of health education is the responsibility of the Ministry of Education, while its equipment and technology are the responsibility of the Ministry of Health. In each province and city, the Education Department should set up a health education committee to take charge of it. In short, it is essential to make sure that both sports and health education are effectively linked together to achieve the practical effect of enhancing national physical strength. Traditional Chinese martial arts are a method of physical exercise unique to our country and should be included as a path in the sports teaching materials of schools. The Ministry of Education should organize a national martial arts teaching materials review committee to formulate teaching materials and complete them within a time limit. At the same time, set up national martial arts training centers everywhere to cultivate teachers who train in national martial arts. As for the content and methods of scouting courses, they should also be revised to be more practical. We hope to vigorously promote social scouting to meet actual needs, so that scouting is not just a finishing touch in schools.

V. Improve the National Sports Administrative Organization

Since national sports are valued by the general public, the administrative organization in charge of this undertaking should have a clear system. The Ministry of Education should be the competent authority at the central level, and sports officials in other relevant agencies should have closely linked organizations. The administrative organization in charge of sports in the Ministry of Education should set up a department to take full responsibility for the promotion of national sports. Each province, city, and county should also have a section or division, or responsible personnel, to take charge of this undertaking. The system of sports supervision and inspection should be actively implemented, so that all sports facilities can be practical and realistic, and funds are not wasted. To enrich the establishment of sports venues and the mass production and low-price supply of sports activity tools are necessary conditions for the widespread promotion of national sports, and it goes without saying.

In short, the main purpose of our promotion of national sports in the future is definitely not to beautify the facade, and it is definitely not like competitive performance, but to regard it as a fundamental work to restore the decline of the nation and rise again. Therefore, it is recognized as one of the main undertakings of the education sector. Only in this way can we expect to see the effects of actively implementing national sports: first, the general public should have a physique that meets health standards; second, they should have the skills to defend themselves and the country; third, they should have the habits of serving, helping each other, being orderly and solemn; and fourth, they should have the qualities of being cultured, self-restrained, and cooperative. Only in this way can the minimum standards for the implementation of national sports be said to have been achieved. Only in this way can education achieve the effect of combining literary and military skills and cooperate with military and economic forces to complete the great cause of national construction. We are determined to encourage ourselves with this, and we encourage the people of the country to do the same.

### Bishop Ward Returns to Shanghai after Touring America: Talks about America's Preparation for War: Solid Economy, Advancing Production Capacity: Sufficient to Cope with Simultaneous Warfare in Both Oceans: Startling Changes in People's Attitudes towards European and Asian Wars

According to the Western newspapers, Bishop Ward of the Methodist Church in America recently returned to China after his vacation in America. He departed from San Francisco, traveled to Japan, stayed for a few days, and then took the President Coolidge steamer to Shanghai, arriving on the morning of the 23rd. Bishop Ward declined to comment on the situation in Japan, but he described in detail the impressions he gained from his observations in the United States to news reporters.

America is Almost

Inevitable in War

In the past six months, America's attitude towards the wars in Europe and Asia has undergone startling changes. American public opinion is now prepared to fight simultaneously in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. Americans certainly do not want war, but most people believe that America is inevitable in war. The American government and people have recognized the current problems and crises and are prepared to act in unison to deal with everything. America's war preparations are becoming increasingly substantial. Various basic industries have only utilized 60% to 70% of their production capacity for several years, but now they are catching up rapidly and have reached 90% or even 100%.

Military Build-up

United in Purpose

The stock market is exceptionally stable and strong. Any surprising new developments in the international arena only cause a slight fatigue. The incidents that have occurred abroad and the mutual collusion of various forces have long been anticipated. The United States, both upper and lower levels, is not surprised. Moreover, the actions of the United States in finance and politics have a definite course of action. On the one hand, tens of billions of dollars are allocated to build up the military, and the government's proposals are almost immediately approved by Congress. It is known that both the Senate and the House of Representatives have obtained extremely important information about the international crisis and the changes in Europe and Asia, and they believe that the overall situation is indeed urgent. The emotions and thoughts of the American people on the issue of war have also changed greatly. This is extremely important. Whether Wilkie or Roosevelt is elected president, there will be no major changes in the state and determination of America's war preparations. This can be asserted.

Anglo-American Unity

Stronger Than Before

In recent years, the United States has been making economic adjustments. If other countries continue to take provocative steps, causing the United States to fight simultaneously in both oceans, its economic structure will be able to stand firm. What's more, the strength of the British Navy is still intact. The unity between Britain and the United States is now stronger than it was during the last World War. During the last World War, the United States did not participate until two years later. Now, it has only been a little over a year, and the American government and people are well aware of the problems involved and their significance to the United States. As for the conscription of millions of young people into the army and navy, and the government's right to requisition property and wealth when necessary, these are merely signs of America's psychological preparation for war.

International Situation

Everyone Understands

The vast majority of Americans have a unified opinion on international issues. Compared with internal political disputes, they are insignificant. Isolationism has long been eliminated. Every household is eagerly listening to international news reports on the radio every day. American newspapers and magazines are spending huge sums of money to send the most capable reporters to station in various parts of the world to gather detailed news and report to the public. Those who want to understand the strength of American public opinion and the strength of mobilization must not neglect this reality.

Gentle Words

Decisive Actions

The proactive position in the current international dispute has recently shifted from Germany and Italy to the United States. Although the United States still wants to avoid open warfare with any country in Asia or Europe, it has acknowledged that the time for resorting to treaties and international concessions has passed. The "speak softly and carry a big stick" policy advocated by President Wilson and the 26th President Theodore Roosevelt during the last World War has reappeared today. It took Germany a long time to rise and implement conscription. However, the United States has now risen and is rapidly implementing conscription.

Prepared to Deal with

Any Eventuality

Bishop Ward said that in the months before leaving the United States, he had twice crossed the American continent and traveled to the most remote states in the United States to personally ask people from all walks of life about their views and attitudes. He learned that the American people are all concerned about the issue of world war. If the belligerent countries can restore reason and conduct fair negotiations on international issues, the United States is still willing to work with other countries to seek peace. However, the United States is now determined to use its maximum strength to deal with any eventuality. This is clearly visible.

### People Have Starved to Death in the Japanese Blockade Zone in Western Shanghai: The Japanese Are Searching the Entire Area: The Survival of Residents is Uncertain: Relief from the Tragedy Depends on Assistance

According to the English-language Great American Evening Post, the lanes and alleys of Jikefeili Road, Tongyu Road, and Chenlu are still blockaded by the Japanese military police, "municipal police," and "special agents." As a result of not being able to go out to shop, two people have starved to death inside. One was an old man in his sixties, and the other was a fourteen-year-old youth suffering from illness.

Expanded Search

After Seiichi Sato, the head of the Shanghai Japanese Military Police team, was assassinated at 668 Yuyuan Road on the 18th of this month (yesterday's newspaper mistakenly printed it as Lane 668), the Japanese side immediately implemented strict security measures in the area of western Shanghai. Japanese military police were stationed along the way to strictly search pedestrians. The security and search area was initially limited to Yuyuan Road, Jikefeili Road, Yidingpan Road, Daxilu Road, Difeng Road, and other areas, but this morning it has been expanded to Bailinan Road and Zhaofeng Park, covering the entire area of western Shanghai. Two days after Sato was assassinated, the Japanese military police set up a long table at the intersection of Yuyuan Road and Difeng Road. Anyone passing through that place must register their name, origin, age, address, and occupation. In the previous few days, women passing through that place did not need this procedure, but from this morning onwards, women cannot be exempted either. The severity of the situation is unprecedented. It is also heard that as a result of the searches conducted by the Japanese army on the roads of western Shanghai in recent days, about 200 civilians have been arrested as suspicious.

Difficult Transportation

Currently, bus routes 1, 14, and 2, and trolleybus route 20 still only travel to the area and terminate at Jing'an Temple Road. Another shuttle bus is dispatched to run between Jing'an Temple Road and Zhaofeng Park, Dunxin Road, and Anhe Temple Road. Residents in the western Shanghai area are currently living in seclusion, so there are very few passengers on the buses. Yesterday morning, a reporter from a Western newspaper went to inspect the area and saw buses traveling from Jing'an Temple to Jikefeili Road and Pingyuan Road forced to stop. Chinese passengers had to get off and leave their names and were only allowed to move forward after being searched. Pedestrians and passengers in cars must also be searched, but foreigners are not interfered with. As for the incident site of the Japanese military police assassination, 668 Lane, Qianjia Alley, which connects Jikefeili Road to the north, Malu Bridge, Kaina Road 189 Lane to the south, and Yuyuan Road 608 Lane, Tianzhuang, to the east, and Jikefeili Road to the northeast, Yanjiatai, the Japanese side immediately erected barbed wire fences at all exits after the incident and blockaded them. On the morning of the 21st, the Japanese side once ordered the residents in the blocked area to provide mutual guarantees to allow entry and exit, but this measure was short-lived and was cancelled.

Residents Starving

There are about 20 factories, more than 100 shops, about 3,000 employees, and 20,000 residents in the area. There was originally one rice shop in Qianjia Alley, with no more than dozens of shi of rice, which has all been sold out in the past week. It is heard that the price of rice in the area has now increased to 160 yuan per dan, but no one has been able to buy it. Poor residents have been starving for several days. Because the area is tightly sealed, garbage trucks and garbage trucks cannot enter the area to work, resulting in messy garbage and garbage in the area. It is also learned that a catty of green vegetables in the area costs as much as 1.2 yuan, and a large pancake costs half a yuan. It is hoped that international people with humanitarian hearts will find a way to send food to help these thousands of innocent poor people.

### The French Concession Removed the Blockade Network the Night Before Last: Most of the Important Roads Have Been Announced: The Police Still Have the Power to Block at Any Time

In order to maintain law and order within the concession, the French Concession authorities took strict special security measures, sealing off most of the roads within the concession with barbed wire fences. The few openings that were left were also heavily guarded by detectives. For more than two months, it has not been relaxed at all. Although the residents in the concession felt extremely inconvenienced and the various shops were also considerably affected, because of the strict security measures, the

Crime Decreased

Security was able to be ensured. Now the French Concession authorities, because the situation in the concession is peaceful and the traffic strike has also been resolved, in order to reduce the inconvenience of traffic for residents, they especially removed most of the road blockades that had been maintained for more than a month, starting at 8:00 PM the night before last. It is calculated that the barbed wire fences that have been removed include the Bund, Jiangxi Road, Old North Gate, Great World, Mahuo Road, Chongqing Road, Fuxu Road, Notre Dame Road, Albert Road, etc. Places where openings have been opened include Jixiang Street, Zhengjia Mu, Natural Fire Street, Jule Road, Marang Road, and Beidi'aos Road. Residents in general all find it convenient. At the same time, the armored vehicles that used to be stationed at various important locations have

Disappeared Without a Trace

However, this move does not mean the removal of special security measures. Military police are still stationed at various fortresses and important intersections. The main traffic routes have increased police force guarding them with automatic rifles. Patrols are still active. It is learned that if the order of the French Concession is peaceful, it is possible to maintain the status quo for a longer period of time. Otherwise, it will still use its power to adopt strict measures at any time.

### New American Consul General: Took Office Yesterday

Lockhart, the new American Consul General in Shanghai, arrived in Shanghai on the President Coolidge steamer the day before yesterday and checked into the Huamao Hotel on the Bund that evening. At 9:00 AM yesterday, Mr. Locke went to the American Consulate on Jiangxi Road to take office. The transfer was handled by Deputy Consul General Potterick. From yesterday onwards, the affairs of the American Consulate will be executed by Mr. Locke. The main task of the consulate is to continue to handle the withdrawal of non-essential American expatriates staying in Shanghai. After taking office, Mr. Locke immediately met with military and political officials stationed in Shanghai, such as Rear Admiral Glassford, Commander of the Yangtze River Fleet, and Major Baker, Commander of the American Defense Forces in Shanghai. In the afternoon, Mr. Locke left the consulate to pay a return visit to the officers.

### Abe Returns to Japan

General Abe, the Japanese "special envoy," left Shanghai on the Japanese postal ship Tatsuta Maru at 11:00 AM yesterday to return to Japan. The Japanese newspapers have forbidden the publication of Abe's decision to come to Shanghai, for reasons unknown. Abe arrived in Shanghai by train from Ningbo at 3:30 PM the day before yesterday. The traffic along North Sichuan Road and along the range road was cut off for 15 minutes when Abe arrived in Shanghai. After getting off the train, Abe, dressed in plain clothes and accompanied by escorts, rode in a car with the flag of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and went to the Japanese Consulate with the Director of the Chinese Intelligence Department of the Japanese Army, who came to welcome him.

### The Deadline for the Tenth Month Settlement is Approaching - Internal Market Meeting

As the deadline for the tenth month settlement in the Shanghai commercial market approaches, the Bankers' Association will hold an internal market meeting at 2 PM today. The meeting will address extending credit for existing clients with loans due in the tenth month and appropriately providing new loans. This will be limited to factories and businesses dealing in domestic goods. Various industries that have borrowed have already contacted banks and firms to negotiate extension and repayment procedures. While there is no precise total for loans due in the tenth month, it is estimated to be between 50 and 60 million yuan, a significant decrease compared to before the war. This is because, after the war, banks and firms primarily focused on secured loans, considering unsecured loans too risky and tightening them. This has led to an abundance of idle funds in the Shanghai financial market, resulting in the continued prevalence of speculative businesses. While bank deposits have increased, there is a lack of proper investment channels. The movement of funds to the interior is underway, so credit is loose, and the market remains relatively stable. Various industries should be able to weather this tenth-month settlement. However, industries are facing reduced exports due to obstructed transportation to the interior. Efforts are currently being made to establish joint transportation of passengers and goods between Shanghai, Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou provinces to facilitate cargo transport and alleviate the difficulties faced by Jiangsu merchants.

### Four Steamers Detained for Over a Year - Rumored to be Released

The steamships "Li Bao," "Chao Yang," "Mao Da," and "Mao Quan," which formerly operated on the Zhejiang shipping route, were detained by the Japanese last spring on the grounds of unclear nationality. They have been held for nearly a year. In mid-September of this year, rumors circulated that the Japanese would release them. However, the ships remain moored at Buoy No. 11 in Yangshupu. A Datong News Agency reporter inquired with relevant parties and learned that the Japanese initially planned to purchase the vessels but the owners refused. It is now rumored that release procedures are being considered and that the ships will be returned.

### Increased Cigarette Tax

The Ministry of Finance has telegraphed the consolidated tax authorities in Fujian, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and the southwestern regions, stating that due to recent soaring prices, the tax-paid prices and tax rates for consolidated taxes on tobacco and alcohol should be revised accordingly. The Ministry has approved the following regarding consolidated taxes: (1) Machine-made cigarettes will be taxed in four grades. Those with a registered price of 1600 yuan or more per 50,000-cigarette carton will be in the first grade and taxed 1600 yuan. Those with a registered price between 800 and 1600 yuan will be in the second grade and taxed 800 yuan. Those with a registered price between 400 and 800 yuan will be in the third grade and taxed 400 yuan. Those with a registered price below 400 yuan will be in the fourth grade and taxed 200 yuan. (2) Hand-rolled cigarettes will be taxed in two grades. Those with a registered price between 100 and 200 yuan per 50,000 cigarettes will be in the first grade and taxed 200 yuan. Those with a registered price below 100 yuan will be in the second grade and taxed 50 yuan.

### Telephone Service Disrupted in Zhabei - Japanese Side Attaches Great Importance

At approximately 11:30 PM the day before yesterday, the cable of the "China Electric Communication Company" in Hongkou, specifically the one inside the Commercial Press on Baoshan Road, was inexplicably cut. As a result, telephone service in the Zhabei area was disrupted. The company has dispatched a repair crew to urgently repair the cut. An investigation suggests that this was purely an act of theft, but it is also being treated with great importance.

### Japanese Troops Invade Gan Village - Retreat After Fierce Battle

According to reliable sources in the shipping industry, on the morning of the 17th, Japanese troops invaded Gan Village. Forty to fifty Japanese soldiers launched a fierce attack. Chinese troops mounted a resolute defense, and a fierce battle ensued. By approximately 3 PM, the Japanese were routed. The island is now pacified, and shipping to and from Shanghai is proceeding as usual.

### Rice Market Flooded with Spot Goods - Rice Prices Decline Again Yesterday

The stockpile of rice in Shanghai is gradually increasing, causing panic among hoarders. To avoid unexpected losses, they are supplying the market with large quantities of spot goods. The rice market is crowded with people, and brokers are extremely busy. These individuals are acting as agents for firms, facilitating transactions and earning commissions. Sales are also frequently observed. However, buyers are hesitant and taking a wait-and-see approach, anticipating further price declines. Yesterday morning, after the rice market opened, conditions were extremely quiet. Rice prices fell by approximately 10 to 20 cents per shi, following the decline of the previous day. Spot goods are abundant.

### British Concession Has No Aggressive Measures for Evacuation - British American Tobacco Company Has Notified Employees to Bear Travel Expenses for Family Evacuation

Regarding the evacuation of non-essential British nationals from Shanghai, inquiries made by reporters yesterday with British Concession authorities revealed that the British government has not made any further plans. British nationals have also not made any preparations for voluntary evacuation. However, it is understood that the British American Tobacco Company in Shanghai has notified all employees with British or American nationality that the company will bear all travel expenses for employees who evacuate their wives and children from Shanghai. It is reported that only a portion of employees will take advantage of this preferential treatment. However, it is generally expected that if the situation deteriorates further, more employees will be willing to accept it. According to British shipping companies, the British Embassy's announcement has not caused a rush to purchase ship tickets. While current travel to Europe is severely restricted, it is reported that there are many people booking tickets for ships sailing to Australia. There has been no news regarding the British government's plans to increase the number of ships for evacuating nationals in the event of an emergency.

Washington Instructions

Reduced Fares

The American President Lines received instructions yesterday from Washington regarding the four major passenger ships scheduled to evacuate American nationals from the Far East. Fares will be reduced. The President Monroe, arriving in Shanghai on November 1st, will maintain its usual first-class fares, but berths in common rooms will be reduced by US$50 per person. The new second-class fares will range from US$240 to US$350, and first-class fares will start at US$395, similar to the President Coolidge. Fares for the Matson liner Mariposa will be approximately the same. However, details about fare changes for the Washington and Manhattan were not available yesterday. It is understood that even with full occupancy, the related companies will suffer losses under the new fares. The US government has guaranteed to compensate the shipping companies for any losses incurred. The President Monroe has increased the number of second-class berths to 230 and first-class berths to over 630. Meanwhile, the meetings held by various American groups in Shanghai have not yielded concrete results.

### British Scholar Arrives in Shanghai from London - Discusses Impressions of the European War After a Year (Part 1) - Mentions the Impact on the Far East

More than a year has passed since the expansion of the European War. After the setbacks in the French campaign, all parties are placing their hopes on the British side of the war. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency interviewed a prominent British scholar yesterday, who had just arrived in Shanghai from London, to discuss the recent situation of the European War. Having personally experienced major war zones in Europe, his observations are detailed. He also has important insights into the impact of the European War on the Far East. The various situations are recorded below:

French Setbacks

The collapse of France left Britain in a position of fighting alone. The well-equipped and trained British Expeditionary Force escaped from a difficult situation, sustaining considerable losses in armaments and materiel. As of today, the other side of the English Channel is in German hands. However, less than half an hour away from England by air, there are strong British air force bases, including the largest naval ports. What the world expected was a swift surrender, or at best a swift compromise, so that Germany could annex the newly defeated countries and turn against the British Empire. Britain is now the bravest nation and the only nation with superior armaments compared to Germany.

British Air Force

The causes and consequences of this European War are now clear. The inadequate use of the League of Nations over the past twenty years has led to this dispute. Originally, building a continental army would not have been a problem. France could have been in a leading position in military affairs, with the British support forming ten divisions, all mechanized units with the latest weapons. In fact, Britain supplied more than twelve divisions, in addition to numerous local reserve troops and a large number of soldiers who, sensing the urgency of the situation before the outbreak of war, had registered but had not been trained. The Navy was also sufficient to control the seas, ready to respond to any German naval activity. As for the British Air Force, although small in number, it was exquisitely trained, so the only thing that Germany believed it could not suppress was the British Air Force.

Strategic Gains and Losses

Aggressor nations often have an advantage in attack; they can choose the time and place to make the most effective surprise attack. The defending nation, on the other hand, does not know when the other side will attack, so it can only be vigilant at all times. As a result, because the defense has lasted too long, it is broken through.

The Retreat

In the air force aspect, British planning was clearly superior, because whether in equipment or personnel, it far surpassed Germany. Once, the British army was trapped in Dunkirk, and everyone thought it would be completely wiped out. However, although the military situation had reached an irredeemable point, thanks to the devoted efforts of all the officers and soldiers of the army, navy, and air force, the miracle of a safe withdrawal was achieved. This was the first failure of the German Air Force. Out of 25,000 targets, only 50 ships were sunk, which shows that the threat of the air force is no more fearsome than that of submarines. As for sealing off ships in the English Channel, it is impossible. The German gun emplacements defending the narrow passage between Calais and Dover could not prevent escort ships from coming and going, but instead allowed them to safely reach London.

Air Raid Situation

German aircraft first use a few or a small squadron of aircraft to conduct reconnaissance over London, followed by bombing of airfields to drive away fighter planes, making it easier for bombers to attack. However, after two months of continuous bombing, not a single airfield has been destroyed. Instead, reports are often received that many squadrons of German aircraft turn back before reaching the British coast. The British side has many prominent targets, such as docks and aircraft manufacturing plants, which the Germans believe are too costly to attack. Because each air raid causes only minor damage to materiel or personnel, the Germans vent their anger by dropping their bombs on unprotected workers' villages in the cities. The Germans have completely forgotten the lessons learned during the last Great War. They are judging others by themselves, preparing to strike at British morale. Even in the Napoleonic Wars, the poet Schiller advised the Germans to organize guerrilla forces to resist for a long time. But their plan was not accepted, because the Germans knew that if they had to risk losing their property during the war, they would not want to fight. It costs the German aircraft a great price to attack England from the sky, as evidenced by the air raids on August 18, September 15, and September 27. As for night raids, even with a clear moon, the military losses are minimal. The number of German bombers is often four or five times that of British fighter planes. However, the British Air Force has not suffered any defeats. During several air raids, it is cheaper for the defender than for the attacker, because air combat is carried out over British soil or the English Channel, so most of the British pilots shot down by German aircraft can often be rescued, while German pilots, once shot down, are a loss, whether dead or alive. The seriousness of the situation is evidenced by Germany's request that Red Cross ships be allowed to cross the English Channel. Such appeals are originally not made unless they have to be.

### Transportation Labor Dispute Between Two Companies - No Mutual Compensation for Losses - Intercommunication of Vehicles Has Not Yet Resumed Yesterday

After the French-owned Water and Electricity Company workers returned to work the day before yesterday, all vehicles have resumed their old routes. However, of the thirty-nine Route 22 buses running from Xujiahui to the Bund, only thirty-four were dispatched yesterday because more than ten workers had not returned to work. The remaining five vehicles can also be dispatched after all the workers arrive today.

Strike Losses

No Mutual Compensation

The British-owned Shanghai Electric Construction Company and the French-owned Electric Company have an agreement regarding the operation of each other's vehicles outside their respective areas. The British company's Route 5 trams and Route 17 and 24 trolleybuses can operate in the French Concession. The French company's Route 5 trams and Route 17, 18 and 24 trolleybuses can also operate in the International Settlement. The fare revenue is collected by the company in each area. Both parties have agreed that if there are strikes or other situations that prevent the trams from operating on their usual routes, the losses will be compensated by the company where the incident occurred. However, since this strike occurred simultaneously in both concessions, neither party will compensate for losses.

Connecting Transportation

Awaiting Resumption

However, transportation links between the two concessions have not yet resumed as of yesterday. One account is that the two companies have not yet agreed on the issue of vehicle transfers, and another is that the British company's go-slow strike has not been fully resolved. Therefore, the two concessions cannot communicate for the time being. However, residents who want to take a vehicle from the International Settlement to the French Concession, or from the French Concession to the International Settlement, still need to transfer vehicles, so they feel very inconvenient. They all hope that the tram company authorities in the two concessions can agree on a transportation plan as soon as possible to facilitate transportation.

### Mill Notes in Circulation

Those not yet issued are deposited.

Those in circulation are not redeemed.

The Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank of China, have received an order from the Ministry of Finance stating that, mill notes in Guangdong Province were, in 1936, reissued after the Ministry issued a government bond to replenish the reserve for financial stability in Guangdong and in 1937, it was clearly stipulated that one yuan of mill notes should be equivalent to four jiao and four fen of legal tender. All receipts and payments of public and private funds in Guangdong Province were required to be made at this rate. Since its implementation, the credit of mill notes has become increasingly consolidated. In order to consider the current situation of the Guangdong goods market and to prevent any attempts to disrupt financial stability, the following measures are specifically formulated: (1) One yuan of mill notes in Guangdong is equivalent to seven jiao of legal tender and there is no need for redemption. (2) All public and private funds and all buying and selling transactions in Guangdong Province must be conducted at the above rate. Violators will be punished. Those who privately set market prices by silver shops will be severely punished for the crime of disrupting financial stability once they are found. (3) Mill notes in Guangdong that have not been issued must be delivered to the Guangzhou branch of the Issuance Reserve Management Committee immediately for safekeeping and cannot be reissued without the approval of the Ministry of Finance. (4) The Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank of China, and the Guangdong Provincial Bank, can only issue drafts for the interior of Guangdong Province when they receive mill notes in Hong Kong and will not redeem legal tender in Hong Kong.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Rewards Police Officers for Bravery

At approximately 8:15 PM on the night of the first of last month, four robbers, two of whom were armed with handguns, broke into a rice store at No. 261 Zhoushan Road to rob it. As they were searching, one of the store's employees secretly slipped out the back door and called the Huishan Police Station through a neighbor. After receiving the report, the police station immediately dispatched several detectives, including Western Deputy Inspector Blythe Sandin, Western Detective Brandenburg, and Maytley, to rush to the scene. Deputy Inspector Blythe saw through the gap in the shop door that the robbers were still coercing the store employees and had not left. He immediately instructed his two companions to go around to the side door and guarded the front door with a Japanese probationary police officer. After a while, he knocked on the door. When the door opened, he saw a robber pointing a gun at him. The deputy inspector immediately fired several shots, wounding two robbers. One of the robbers soon died.

Also, at approximately 1:20 PM on August 24, two cases of armed robbery occurred at a residence at No. 433 Lane on Xinza Road. After hearing the alarm, the police station immediately dispatched Western Sergeant Holden, probationary Sergeants Hickbert, Marguez, and Erickson, Chinese Detective No. 292, and Chinese Constable No. 1536 and others to rush to the scene. Probationary Sergeant Hickbert broke down the door and saw two robbers trying to escape upstairs. Hickbert immediately fired a shot and, together with two other companions, went upstairs to pursue them. They then discovered an armed robber on the roof of the house at No. 10 and captured him, seizing his handgun. The other robber jumped from the roof, was injured, and fell to the ground. Probationary Sergeant Ellis captured him and seized his handgun.

Also, at 5:15 AM on July 18, robbers, including two armed individuals, broke into a boiled water shop at No. 3 Xinzhaobridge Road, intending to rob it. The shop owner shouted for help. The robbers failed to rob and fled through the door. At this time, Chinese Constable No. 492 and others heard the alarm and rushed to the scene. They saw three robbers fleeing along the Meibaiker Road and Shanhai Pass Road area, so they immediately chased after them. Chinese Constable No. 3332 and 3264 joined the chase. A robber was shot and wounded by Chinese Constable No. 3332 on Chengdu Road, and his handgun was seized.

The Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department Awards Committee has approved the issuance of a medal to Western Deputy Inspector Blythe Sandin, who is resourceful and brave and deserves commendation (Blythe has previously been awarded a second-class medal). In addition, a second-class medal will be awarded to each of the Western Probationary Sergeant Hickbert and Chinese Constable No. 3332 to show encouragement.

### Direct Shanghai-Burma Shipping - Cargo Congestion

The Grayle Steamer will Sail to Rangoon the Day After Tomorrow

The Shenguang Steamer will Sail to Singapore

After the reopening of the Burma Road, foreign shipping companies in Shanghai are urgently seeking direct shipping routes between Shanghai and Burma. The Taikoo Company has already shipped several batches of cargo to Rangoon, transported via Hong Kong and Singapore. Today, another batch is being loaded onto the Jinan steamer for transport to Hong Kong and then to Rangoon. The Grayle steamer of Zilai Foreign Company, manager of the Tongyi and Hongyun shipping companies, which was originally scheduled to depart today, will now clear customs tomorrow due to cargo congestion and incomplete procedures, and will set sail directly for Rangoon the day after tomorrow (the 27th), with stopovers at Moulmein and Calcutta. The Shenguang steamer of Yilong Company, also managed by the two shipping companies, was originally planned to sail to Rangoon with the Grayle, but has now been changed to sail to Hong Kong and Singapore due to pending cargo. It is scheduled to depart tomorrow. In addition, the Santai steamer, jointly operated by China Through Transportation Navigation Company and the Tongyi Shipping Company, which will sail directly to Hong Kong, is scheduled to depart tomorrow. It is heard that the post office has set up an office in Rangoon and a joint postal station in Lashio.

### More British Nationals Leave Shanghai to Enlist in the Military

### Wang Peng Narrowly Escapes an Assassination Attempt at the Intersection of Jiangxi Road and Nanjing Road - Thugs Ambush but He Escapes - Bodyguard Resists and Dies from Gunshot Wounds

A shooting incident occurred at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Jiangxi Road at approximately 12:15 PM yesterday, with gunfire erupting suddenly, creating a tense situation. The target fortunately escaped, but one bodyguard died. A passerby was wounded by a stray bullet. The details of the incident are reported below:

Sudden Ambush

Wang Peng, from Anhui Province, is 38 years old and currently resides at No. 38, Lane 192, Boundary Road. He formerly served as an adjutant in Yang Huqian's Shanghai Garrison Headquarters. He is currently employed as a comprador for the British-owned China General Omnibus Company and jointly owns the Wankang Gold Shop at No. 310 Jiangxi Road, serving as its manager. He owns a private car and employs a bodyguard, Chen Lihong, from Nanjing (33 years old this year), who protects him at all times. At 12:10 PM yesterday, he left the writing room in his gold shop, intending to return home for lunch. As he was walking to his car in front of the Jiutai Exchange Shop on the south side of Nanjing Road, he suddenly encountered danger.

Battle Between Both Sides

Just as he was getting into the car, two thugs in blue cotton long gowns suddenly drew out Mauser pistols and ambushed Wang. Fortunately, they missed. His bodyguard, Chen Lihong, seeing the situation, immediately drew his gun and returned fire. The thugs then shifted their target and engaged with Chen. More than twenty shots were fired, the sound of bullets was like a string of firecrackers. At that time, Wang also drew his gun and opened fire on the thugs, but they were not injured. As a result, Chen was shot in the right side of the abdomen, collapsed, and fell onto the sidewalk of the Jiutai Exchange Shop, gasping for breath and bleeding profusely. Seeing that their objective had been achieved, the assassins fled north with their weapons and disappeared without a trace.

Passersby Wounded

During the battle between the two sides, pedestrians scattered and fled, creating a very chaotic situation. At the same time, the Central Police Station heard the alarm and quickly dispatched a large number of police officers in patrol cars to rush to the scene, blockading the streets and searching door to door, but ultimately found nothing. During the shooting, a stray bullet hit the arm of a rickshaw passenger, who was later taken to the hospital for treatment. A Russian man sitting by the window of the Victoria Cafe across the street witnessed the assassins running north and quickly grabbed an ashtray and threw it at the thugs from the window. Unfortunately, it fell just a few feet short and missed.

Bodyguard Died

After the event, it was learned that the injured Chen Lihong was 29 years old, from Nanjing, and had been employed in his position for over two years. He was usually honest and hardworking, and was deeply trusted by his employer Wang. Yesterday, he was wearing a navy blue woolen student uniform and brown leather shoes. The serial number of his bodyguard's self-defense pistol was 931733. Chen resided in Hongkou. Soon after, the Red Cross ambulance arrived at the scene and rushed him to Tongren Hospital for treatment. However, he had already died mid-journey due to the severity of his injuries. The body was then transported to the morgue of Tongren Hospital. At approximately 6:00 PM, the body was transferred to the coroner's office.

### Head Nurse's Death: Lawsuit Over Funeral Expenses - Testimony Heard Yesterday

Following the sudden death on the night of June 10th of Li Yuying (also known as Jie Ru), a woman from Fujian who was the head nurse at the Ya'er Sanatorium on Route Paul Henry (Pu Shi Lu), the hospital's business manager, Lu Zhenqing, failed to report the death to the police for an autopsy as required. Instead, he instructed Dr. Lin Zhengliang to issue a death certificate stating the cause as a stroke. This led to accusations and a lawsuit against Lu and Lin for forging documents, filed by the prosecutor at the High Court Third Branch. A hearing was scheduled for November 5th. However, Li's death has caused

Multiple Disputes,

attracting Social Attention. Tao Yangwu, the manager of the Chinese Funeral Home, is now suing Li Yuying's father, Li Shizhen, in the Civil Division of the Second Special Court, seeking unpaid funeral expenses of 2,404.24 yuan. Judge Tan Hao has held two hearings. The defendant is represented by lawyers Wu Zhibing, Wang Hengyi, and Li Zhongdao. Due to Lu Zhenqing's absence, the hearing was adjourned. These details have been previously reported. Yesterday afternoon,

The Hearing Resumed.

According to Lu Zhenqing's testimony, he only signed the funeral home's authorization form, assuming responsibility for handling the arrangements. The principal mourner was Li Shizhen, so Li should bear the expenses. Witnesses Gan Bowen and He Shuyu (both women, former colleagues of the deceased who have left the Sino-Western Sanatorium), Yan Xianhong, Chen Muxi, and Wu Wenjun all testified that after Li Yuying's death, Lu Zhenqing, without waiting for the deceased's parents to arrive,

Took Charge,

notifying the funeral home to take the body away. On the day of the encoffining, guests suggested that the clothing and coffin should not be too extravagant, but Lu stated that the deceased had made contributions to the hospital, so the hospital would bear the expenses as a donation. Many guests present were aware of this. Gan, He, and Yan further clarified that the funeral expenses had already been collected from Lu Zhenqing by representatives of the Chinese Funeral Home. The court questioned Lu Zhenqing about this. He replied that he never said that, and that the witnesses present today all had

Conflicting Interests

with the Li family and were giving False Testimony. Gan and He swore an oath in court to demonstrate the honesty of their testimony against Lu. After both sides' lawyers presented their opinions, the court considered the defendant's legal arguments to be valid and adjourned the hearing to November 14th.

### Two Notorious Robbers, Repeatedly Involved in Major Cases, Scheduled for Sentencing

Detectives from the Old Gate Police Station, both Chinese and foreign, previously apprehended two notorious robbers: Cao Yong from Xuzhou (father's name Lao Si) and Zhang Fa from Yangzhou. Investigations revealed that the two criminals were involved in the robbery of the Defu Bank on Jiujiang Road on September 11th, where stocks and bonds worth over 257,000 yuan were stolen, as well as the July 26th robbery of the Chinese police officer's handguns at 1553 and 1593 Gordon Road, and numerous other cases within the district. They were prosecuted by the First Special Court. These details have been previously reported. Now, further investigation has revealed that the two criminals were also involved in two major cases: (1) the Kidnapping of senior employees of the Nanyang Tobacco Company, Feng Jiaxiang and Li Zitang, for ransom at 433 Yu Garden Road on May 2nd at 2:05 PM; and (2) the Robbery of Chinese police officer Xia Shutang's handgun and legal tender at 138 Hart Road, Kangnaowan, on January 23rd at 1:10 PM. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Xie Fen held a further hearing on this case. The police lawyer, Ru Bao Yi, charged the two defendants with committing additional crimes, which they both readily admitted. The court then appointed lawyer Zhu Hui as the defendants' legal representative and announced the end of the debate, setting a date for sentencing.

### Four Robberies Yesterday

Near Peng Road and Zha Pu Road, at approximately 4:30 PM yesterday, a man was walking when he was suddenly robbed by three robbers. One of them displayed a handgun and stole 1,000 yuan in national currency.

Near the St. John's University on Route Extrême Orient, at approximately 4:45 PM yesterday, four robbers robbed a passerby. After shouting for help, street police rushed to the scene and fired a shot, resulting in the arrest of one robber.

Near Hart Road and Route Ferguson, at approximately 5:15 PM yesterday, a Western woman was walking when she was suddenly stopped by four unarmed robbers who blocked her path. They stole a purse containing national currency and a watch, with a total value of 120 yuan.

At 76, Lane 1081, Jing An Temple Road, at 5:30 PM yesterday, four robbers arrived, two of them displaying firearms. They stole jewelry worth 200 yuan.

### Headless Corpse Discovered at Xiaoshadu Road and Nanyang Road; Head Later Found on Xinzha Road; Case Unclear, Police Investigating Vigorously

At 6:01 AM yesterday, a sanitation worker, number 27, from the Public Works Department was working at Xiaoshadu Road and Nanyang Road when he discovered a straw mat by the roadside. Upon opening it, he was horrified to find a headless male corpse. The body was wearing a dark brown short shirt and trousers and was barefoot. He immediately reported to the Jing An Temple Police Station, who dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives to investigate. Shortly thereafter, near the roadside at the intersection of New Zha Road and Seymour Road, a cardboard box that appeared to have once contained a radio was found. Inside was a human head, with a flat-top haircut, appearing to be in its thirties, and seeming to have been cut from the headless corpse. The detectives removed the head and body to the morgue and launched a detailed investigation to report back to the police for further action.

Eyewitness Account

According to eyewitnesses, the severed head was thrown from a speeding car that quickly turned west, but the license plate number could not be clearly seen at the time. After the incident, the police dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives to conduct a thorough investigation. In addition to photographing the body and head and sending them to the morgue, they are also investigating the deceased's name, age, and origin in order to clarify the case and apprehend the fleeing murderer. The clothing worn by the male corpse indicated that he was not from the upper class.

One of the Thugs

According to a report by a Dazhong News Agency reporter, the victim was one of the thugs from the Western Shanghai badlands, killed by his own gang due to a betrayal. After killing him, the gang drove in a car to the corner of Xiaoshadu Road, where they threw away his head, and then to Nanyang Road, where they abandoned his body on the road. When the body was discovered by the Chinese police, it was still warm, so it is believed that the murder had occurred not long before. However, the name of the victim had not yet been confirmed as of last night.

### French Tram Workers' Compensation for Zhang Rongkang

Zhang Rongkang, a young man from Taicang, 18 years old, worked as a ticket seller, number 527, for the Eighth Division of the French Tram Company. When all of the mechanics, drivers, and ticket sellers of the French Tram Company went on strike on the 25th of last month, the company hired other workers to drive the vehicles to maintain public transportation. Zhang Rongkang, along with other striking workers, obstructed the vehicles at the intersection of Route Lufan and Rue Pére Hilarion, resulting in him being shot in the abdomen. He was taken to Guangci Hospital by the police, but died on the 29th of the same month. The death was reported, and the Second Special Court sent officials to verify it. The body was taken to the Shanghai Funeral Home for encoffining. Now that the strike has been resolved successfully, all workers returned to work the day before yesterday, and all routes resumed normal operations yesterday. It is reported that regarding the compensation issue for the deceased ticket seller Zhang Rongkang, in addition to the 500 yuan given by the company, more than 2,000 colleagues will each contribute two yuan, totaling 5,000 yuan, which will be given to his family by the fellow workers.

### A Real Man Should Be Energetic and Strong... Why Be Weak and Incompetent...

As husbands with wives, our responsibilities are immensely significant. Not only do we bear the responsibilities of the entire family on our shoulders, but the rise and fall of the nation rests on the shoulders of every citizen. We must also bear some responsibility for society and the nation. Therefore, it is said that a real man should be energetic and strong, striving to be successful, so that he can fulfill his duties with joy. Indeed, a strong man with abundant energy will surely have a fulfilling married life with deep love for each other. The children they bear are the unique crystallization of their love, and the family they build is a happy nest they share. Therefore, his only comfort lies in his wife and children. What hardship can there be in having a family? In serving society professionally, he can also be diligent and dedicated, increasing his work efficiency and reaping rich rewards. Such a husband, although he cannot be said to have achieved self-cultivation, family harmony, national governance, and world peace, can be said to have fulfilled his responsibilities and can be considered a happy and fortunate person. However, if a man suffers from depleted essence and blood due to early self-indulgence and nocturnal emissions, or post-marital debauchery, overindulgence, and worries, resulting in kidney deficiency, impotence, scattered energy, incomplete development, loss of function, as well as neurological weakness symptoms such as brain swelling, headaches, forgetfulness, insomnia, lower back pain, and physical fatigue, he will lose interest even in a beautiful wife. But the way of husband and wife cannot be separated from the relationship between spirit and flesh. When the wife feels lonely, filled with passion, and the husband cannot give her comfort, how can she not be disappointed and resentful? In this situation, an unpleasant cloud will inevitably arise between husband and wife. If this cloud is not quickly dispelled, it will gradually darken and engulf all the light and happiness of his future! Moreover, due to physical weakness, how can he be resourceful, hardworking, and move forward on the path to success in his career? He will inevitably fall into unemployment, poverty, and heavy family burdens! The state of life in such a situation is indescribably difficult!

However, the above-mentioned diseases are not incurable. In today's world of advanced medicine, there are even effective treatments. Why not love yourself and suffer for a long time? An effective treatment is to take the gonadotropic hormone preparation "Sperm Vitality." This agent is made from gonadotropic hormones extracted from strong animals. It is pure in quality, mild in medicinal properties, and has great nourishing power. After taking it, it can generate essence, nourish the kidneys, invigorate the brain, activate blood circulation, and nourish nerves within one day and night. If continued, the above-mentioned symptoms can be completely cured in a short period of time. Only those with nocturnal emissions need to also take "Hymitol Jing Consolidation Tablets" to strengthen the sperm gate and prevent leakage for faster results!

Beauty and Health

### The Sadness of Atrophied Breasts

—Yao Chongpei, MD, USA

According to world-renowned physiologist and beauty expert Kamdeaning and gynecologist Donpison in a recent "Health Bulletin" published in France, "...a woman's temperament becomes eccentric, her complexion haggard, her curves non-existent, and she is in disharmony with her husband, or unable to conceive, or has difficulty conceiving and raising children. This can be said to have a great relationship with the pair of breasts in front of her chest. If intelligent husbands can understand this and use advanced medicine in time to make their wives' breasts stand tall and elastic, then I believe that marital discord or even divorce in the world can be reduced, and they can also have more lively and intelligent children." This argument contains great truth and is an immortal work that contributes to society.

The reason why the Kang and Tang experts attach so much importance to breasts is that women with tall and elastic breasts must have healthy ovarian function and vigorous metabolism, so their hips are full and their curves are beautiful. At the same time, due to the smooth blood circulation, their complexion is naturally delicate, and their temperament is gentle and docile. Such women are treasured by their husbands at home, and their love for each other is deep, so what is the problem with having children? On the other hand, if a woman's breasts are atrophied, no matter how young she is, she will mostly lose her health and happiness. At the same time, she will also suffer from leukorrhea and menstrual irregularities, so she will naturally be unable to bear strong children, or even lose her ability to conceive. Even if she conceives, the fetus born will not only be difficult to raise, but also be particularly prone to death due to the mother's weakness!

Based on these two ratios, it can be seen that breasts are important to a woman's health and beauty. So how should women who already have this defect seek remedy? I say: Always follow the advice of Kang and Tang and use the latest medicine. What is the latest medicine? It goes without saying that it is the ovarian preparation for women, "Sperm Vitality," which is unanimously recommended by Chinese and Western doctors. After taking this agent, it can nourish ovarian function, invigorate metabolism, adjust menstruation, and eliminate all symptoms of leukorrhea, cold uterus, and infertility like a candle illuminating ghosts, in a short period of time, restore the health and beauty that women should have, and make breasts stand tall and attractive.

### Serious Harm and Treatment of Nocturnal Emissions, Venereal Disease Specialist Zhan Nianceng

Based on my medical experience, nine out of ten young men with a sallow complexion and thin physique suffer from nocturnal emission. At the same time, nine out of ten patients with nocturnal emission have their origins in masturbation. Masturbation is an easy bad habit for young people to fall into during puberty. Initially, it is caused by the stimulation of hormones in the body and the urge for curiosity. However, young people have weak willpower and know the harm it causes, but cannot stop themselves from repeating it two or three times, so it is easy to form a habit. Later, driven by the force of "habit becomes nature," it is difficult to correct the bad habit. By the time they grow older, after repeated efforts, they finally quit masturbation or reduce the frequency of masturbation, but their sexual function has been damaged, and nocturnal emission follows.

Once nocturnal emission occurs, the most precious essence in the human body is like having a leaky vessel that cannot be controlled. In the early stages, the symptoms are mild, and emissions occur during sleep due to dreams. Later, emissions occur without dreams, and even during the day. Some even have seminal fluid leaking out during urination or defecation. This is caused by the aggravation of nocturnal emission leading to spermatorrhea and sperm leakage. Although the water of the rivers flows eastward every day, water has a cycle, so there is no place that dries up! Now, with the small amount of seminal fluid produced physiologically, and such a large amount of leakage, can it not be exhausted? If the seminal fluid is exhausted, hundreds of diseases will inevitably arise. The most obvious symptoms are brain weakness, physical thinness, forgetfulness, insomnia, palpitations, timidity, lower back pain, kidney deficiency, impotence, scattered energy, and incomplete development, to name just a few. If such young people get married, they will not only fail to fulfill their human duties in married life, causing their wives to hate them and leading to family tragedies! How can they compete with others and gain superiority in their careers and academics, and will inevitably be in a position of inferiority! However, nocturnal emission is not an incurable disease. In today's flourishing medical world, there is the invention of effective medicines. Patients must take "Hymitol Essence Strengthening Tablets," so that nocturnal emission can be cured. If the above-mentioned symptoms have been caused by nocturnal emission, they must also take the gonadotropic hormone preparation "Sperm Vitality" to nourish the brain and kidneys, increase essence and blood, and completely restore health in a short period of time. If patients can come to this clinic in person and be diagnosed by an expert doctor, and receive scientific therapies such as electrotherapy, injections, and surgery, a cure can be guaranteed.

### Yarn and Cotton Yarn Actually "Bidding for Gold," White Tigers Serving as Yellow Tigers, Six or Seven Thousand Bales as Football Chips

The trend in the yarn market has entered a state of disorder. In reality, most people are optimistic, and the bottom has already risen by 500 yuan from when it was alarming. Therefore, although the market looks to be rising, no one dares to hold it for too long when encountering storms. Both buyers and sellers are in a state of uncertainty. However, general speculators are completely treating cotton yarn as "bidding for gold" (white tigers serving as yellow tigers), and are steering according to the wind. Therefore, although operating for only two hours in the morning, the changes within are truly diverse and difficult to grasp. The football chips kicked around in the market have increased to six or seven thousand bales, and there will be an amazing performance in the future.

The morning yarn market is high because many long positions have not been withdrawn, and a certain large account is still not releasing its tight holdings. Therefore, the public's psychology is propaganda for going long. As soon as the first market opened, buyers flocked in, and 20-count variant yarn rose directly from 1,268 yuan to 1,277 yuan. At this time, the situation suddenly changed. It was said that Blue Phoenix standard yarn prices and actual demand were not smooth. Suddenly, buyers appeared uneasy, and the price fell straight down to 1,256 and 1,257 yuan. When the low price was seen, the long side came again to raise the price and buy, and the price rose again to 1,276 yuan. After the market closed, it rose again. The statistics for half-day trading totaled 6,890 bales, and the market rose by 10 yuan. The amount of each guild purchased is listed below:

Colleagues 6,340, Hong Kong 530

Xiamen 20, Total 6,890

Today, 200 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong for transfer to Yangon, and another 515 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong.

### Profitable Purchase of Foreign Cotton

The current cotton trade is still as quiet as usual, but colleagues mostly feel optimistic, and factories are not purchasing large quantities. The price of cotton purchased overseas can profit 50-60 yuan per dan. Recently, the demand for coarse yarn from the Hong Kong guild has been particularly strong, so the raw materials for coarse yarn are becoming more expensive. The price of Pingguoer is still quite different from the price ratio of 10-count yarn.

In the foreign cotton market, the New York cotton market is firm and lively. The rise in stock prices and purchases on Wall Street resulted in a closing price that was 10 points higher than the previous day. Yesterday, India rose more than one rupee, including forecasts. The foreign cotton trade in Shanghai has been particularly active recently, which is due to the lack of inventory in the market, so the spot price is unusually high. However, due to the lack of goods in the market, large transactions could not be made. But according to the current trend, cotton prices will continue to rise.

Today, 300 bales of cotton were shipped to Hong Kong.

The new colleagues are about the same price as the previous price, and the purchase has been reduced by about 30 yuan.

### American Bank and Chinese Businesses: Foreign Exchange Transactions

Foreign exchange market conditions yesterday: HSBC's listed rates remained unchanged. The unofficial British and American exchange markets showed underlying strength. During the afternoon session, due to continuous selling by American and Chinese banks, liquidity was abundant. The US dollar exchange rate once reached $5.90625. However, the closing was stable, with a mediocre market. Japanese banks sold US dollars to the central bank, but the price was similar to that of the morning. In the end, the evening closing rates were: British gold at 3 shillings 8.25 pence, and the US dollar at $5.875, which was an increase of 0.015625 shillings for the British currency and a decrease of 0.03125 dollars for the American currency compared to the previous day. Both British and American exchange rates for futures were aligned with the spot rates. In the afternoon, the Japanese bank attempted to depress the British pound rate in the local market by selling pounds and buying dollars, but this was resisted by American banks and HSBC, leading to a rebound in the exchange rate from 3 yuan 6 jiao 9.5 fen to 3 yuan 7 jiao 0.5 li.

The easing trend was quite evident.

In the early morning, London's large bar prices for near-term delivery all fell by 0.0625. New York's silver price remained flat. London's raw gold was stagnant. Exchange rates between the British pound and Shanghai were flat. The US dollar fell 25 against the British pound, with no market against the French franc. The central bank's listed rates for various currencies remained the same. Banks opened with the following spot rates: British gold at 3 shillings 7.96875 pence and the US dollar at $5.84375. Compared to the previous day's closing, neither the British nor the American currency showed any change. After the opening, American banks were eager to sell, and the market eased. One American bank reportedly sold US dollars at $5.875 to HSBC, and shortly thereafter, speculators bought them. Because Chinese banks were willing to sell, the market remained relatively stable at that time. Speculators bought US dollars for $5.84375 from Chinese banks for delivery this month. HSBC's listed rates remained unchanged. The silver equalization tax was announced, reducing it by 0.25%. Subsequently, Chinese banks continued to sell, and prices hardened again. Brokers reportedly bought US dollars for $5.875 from Chinese banks for delivery this month. Brokers also sold US dollars for the same month to Japanese banks, all at $5.875. By noon, there were no buyers, so foreign banks were trading US dollars among themselves, reaching as high as $5.92625. However, the noon closing rates were: British gold at 3 shillings 8.125 pence and the US dollar at $5.875, which was an increase of 0.015625 shillings for the British currency and a decrease of 0.03125 dollars for the American currency compared to the morning opening.

Japanese Bank Sells Shillings

The afternoon market was generally flat. The Japanese bank reportedly sold shillings for 3 shillings 18.125 pence to HSBC for delivery this month. HSBC reportedly sold Chinese currency at $5.875 to the Japanese bank for delivery this month. After that, there were few changes. The evening closing rates for British gold, both spot and futures, were 3 shillings 8.125 pence, and the US dollar, both spot and futures, was $5.875. Compared to the previous day's closing, the spot British gold was up 0.015625 shillings, and the next month's was up 0.03125 shillings. The US dollar, both spot and futures, was down 0.03125 dollars.

Hong Kong Exchange Rates Ease

Hong Kong, 24th (Shanghai, 4th): This morning's market is stable. British exchange rates for spot and futures, as well as the Japanese exchange rate for spot, are unchanged. The US dollar exchange rate for spot is down 0.0625, at $23.0625. The Shanghai exchange rate for spot is up one yuan, at 391 yuan. (Yesterday afternoon, it was 391 yuan.) At 11:10, it was reported as flat. The Shanghai exchange rate for spot fell back one yuan, to 391 yuan. At 11:30, it was reported as flat. All exchange rates are generally unchanged. The noon closing is stable. The British exchange rate for spot is down 0.03125, at 1 shilling 3 pence. The forward rate is unchanged. The market opened at 2:30 PM and was reported as flat. All exchange rates are generally unchanged.

Tianjin Exchange Market Stable

Tianjin, 24th (Thursday): This morning, the exchange market opened and was reported as flat. London and New York telegraphic transfers, as well as the Shanghai exchange and "Joint Notes" unofficial markets, are unchanged.

### Foreign Currencies First Rise, Then Return to Flat

Yesterday's foreign currency market conditions: the market price of the chih-ts'ih currency rose and then stabilized. British and American gold pounds also initially retreated and then rebounded. British gold notes continued to decline, eventually falling by one yuan. American gold notes also trended lower, eventually falling by seven fen. Hong Kong notes had balanced supply and demand, and the market price stabilized. The upward trend of Japanese gold notes did not subside, reaching as high as one yuan and five jiao in the evening market. Korean notes remained unchanged, still standing at one yuan and one jiao nine fen original price in the evening market.

### Both British and Indian Silver Prices Are Low

London, 23rd: The large bar silver market, both near and far terms, fell by 0.0625. Market conditions were stable, with few transactions. The market remained stable after closing. New York reports that the American silver price is flat for spot. Bombay reports that Indian silver, both spot and futures, is down one anna. The market is flat, with a total of 20 transactions.

### Discount Rate Plummets Three Yuan

Yesterday, the discount rate for cleared bills suddenly plummeted again. The discount rate for every thousand yuan has dropped to only ten yuan, and the lending rate has also retreated to twelve yuan, three yuan lower than the previous day. The interest rate for interbank lending at the Money Trade Association remained unchanged. Both the morning and afternoon markets were quoted at 0.11 yuan.

### The Thickness of Fake Aluminum Coins

This newspaper published an article about a fake aluminum coin on October 23. Here are a few points to supplement it: Genuine coins are thick, while fake coins are thin. The thickness of a fake coin is about nine-tenths of that of a genuine coin. That is, the thickness of ten fake coins is slightly equal to that of nine genuine coins.

The edges of genuine coins are clear and distinct, while those of fakes are blurred and shallow, as previously reported. If you touch it with your hand, the edges of genuine coins are clearly raised and feel sharp, while fakes feel smooth and lack depth.

### Bank Clearinghouse Reduces Interest on Clearing Deposits

The Shanghai Banking Industry Joint Preparatory Committee issued a circular to various banks yesterday, stating that, effective November 1, the interest rate on all clearing deposits at clearing banks will be changed from the original 3% to 2%, and the interest rate on commercial deposits outside clearing banks will be changed from 3% to 1.75%.

### Silk and Tea, Parachute Fabric, US Orders One Million Yards, Using 160,000 Pounds of Real Silk

According to a Westerner, since the sudden tension between Japan and the United States this autumn, the US authorities have greatly increased the use of real silk fabrics for military aircraft parachute materials in order to implement their new national defense plan. It is said that the Army authorities ordered one million yards of silk parachute fabric from a well-known domestic silk weaving factory a month ago, which greatly increased the silk demand from silk factories. According to estimates, one million yards of silk fabric requires 159,600 pounds of real silk.

### North-South Goods, New Longan Market, Prices Loose but Still High

New dried longan has been fully opened for sale yesterday, and prices have eased, but are still high. The selling prices of the brokers have also been agreed upon: the top grade is 550 yuan, the heaven grade is 350 yuan, and the tian-hong grade is 220 yuan. All original goods must be sorted and packaged by hand, resulting in only a small profit.

### Piece Goods, Fine Cloth Soars, Plus Zhejiang and Fujian Can Be Navigated

Domestic cloth prices remained high yesterday. Because eastern fine cloth has soared in recent days, domestic cloth is greatly affected. Moreover, the ports of Zhejiang and Fujian have resumed navigation, and the backlog of goods has a slight opportunity to be cleared. Therefore, people's confidence has increased. Selling prices for fine twill and fine cloth have increased by 2.5 jiao, and coarse cloth, Luanchang, Yihe bleached cloth, and colored cloth have increased by 2.5 to 5 jiao. Bleached cloth and poplin from this factory have also increased by 5 jiao. The street traded over 1,000 pieces of spot and next month's futures of grey cloth, twill, fine cloth, bleached cloth, and printed cloth. Zhejiang gangs traded over 200 pieces of colored cloth, bleached cloth, poplin, and coarse cloth. Guangdong and Hong Kong gangs traded over 300 pieces of colored cloth and colored twill. The northern Yantai gang traded over 100 pieces of coarse cloth, printed goods, and woolen cloth. The blockade along the Shanghai-Ningbo and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines remains the same, and wholesale in the interior is still stagnant.

Eastern Cloth: The upward trend of white goods, fine cloth, and fine twill continues, soaring by more than one yuan per piece. There are rumors in the market that a certain exchange will auction cotton cloth again. The difference between the middle and lower grades of fine cloth and the high-grade leading brands is too great in terms of grade. The industry is searching for ways to maintain it, so the upward trend of the middle grades is strong. Leading fine cloth only increased by 4.5 jiao. Four Gentlemen serge closed at one yuan and one jiao seven fen per yard.

Exports: Today (25th), there are 275 pieces of cotton cloth being shipped to Hong Kong, and another 50 pieces are being shipped to Hong Kong for transshipment to Yangon.

### Over 10,000 Yards of Woolen Fabric Sold

Yesterday, a Thursday, with a strong northwest wind, the market for woolen fabric was even more active. Women's colored woolen fabric was even more popular than men's. Nanjing cargo transportation is preparing to reissue foreign fees and can guarantee transportation permits. The demand from Hong Kong and Guangdong gangs is stronger than it was ten days ago. Merchants from Ningbo with some financial resources are all coming to Shanghai to find ways to transport goods. Because the peak season for woolen goods has arrived, all the various gangs on this street are seeing increased actual sales of overcoats and autumn light woolen fabrics. Yesterday afternoon, throughout the city, excluding the stores, it is said that over 10,000 yards of goods were traded directly and indirectly by street brokers. Western suits and Chinese suits each accounted for half. Linings and camel fleece accounted for over 3,000 yards. Overcoats and thick fabrics accounted for over 2,000 yards. The rest were men's and women's colored woolen serge.

### Food, Foreign Rice Arrives in Endless Streams

The foreign rice market continued to decline yesterday. Green rice has been arriving in crowds for several days, and the goods on the way are still coming to Shanghai in endless streams. Moreover, foreign prices are low, which is the main reason why it is difficult to support the rice market. Yesterday, foreign firms were soliciting orders for No. 2 Saigon rice for delivery next month at only 73 yuan, which is half a yuan less than the previous asking price. People's confidence is weak, and the market is falling step by step. The spot price for original bags of No. 2 Saigon rice returned to the market opened at 74 yuan and 5.6 jiao, which is a fall of 1.5 yuan compared to the previous day's 76 yuan and 1 jiao. The spot market is also oversupplied, as the recent arrivals are all being sold. Prices for all grades have fallen by 5.6 jiao again. Fewer than 1,000 bags were traded. Only 200 tons of original bags were traded. Spot prices were: No. 2 Saigon at 70 yuan and 69 yuan, No. 2 at 63 yuan and 4 jiao, down to 62 yuan and 5 jiao, No. 2 Siam at 61 yuan and 5 jiao, down to 60 yuan, small broken rice at 61 yuan, 60 yuan and 5 jiao, Tokyo super sharp rice from 59 yuan and 5 jiao, down to 57 yuan, broken rice at 52.3 yuan, and Lai Lu at 55 yuan and 55 yuan.

Yesterday, a large amount of foreign rice arrived in Shanghai. The French company's Golden Asia轮 (lun) ship brought over 13,000 bags directly from Saigon. It arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning and docked at the Huashun Wharf in Hongkou for unloading. The Taikoo Company's Taiyuan 轮 (lun) ship brought 8,114 bags from Hong Kong. It arrived at the port yesterday afternoon and docked at the company's wharf in Pudong for unloading. Yesterday, over 21,000 bags of foreign rice arrived in Shanghai. (Zu)

Only 1,000 to 2,000 piculs of new japonica rice and cellar seeds have arrived. However, there are quite a few cellar seeds, and the output is limited. Moreover, the rice cannot withstand storage, so it was sold off sharply at 1.2 yuan, selling for 75.6 yuan. Wild rice opened at 79 yuan. New japonica rice sales are still brisk, and the situation is quite strong. The opening price was high, starting at 75 yuan and 5 jiao, down to 73 yuan. Original bags were 77 yuan. Du Yang sharp rice was still flat, with original bags at 70 yuan. Both thick and thin broken japonica rice had few transactions. Glutinous rice, both domestic and foreign, had sluggish sales to the brewing industry, resulting in a flat market. However, selling prices were similar to before.

### Flour Market Clearly Set, Unofficially Loose

Wheat flour: Since the market price of Huafen Flour Mill was changed to 17 yuan, the supply from various factories has slightly increased. Moreover, customer sales have been stagnant for many days, and people are inevitably slackening. Therefore, although the asking price for returned goods is still high, there are no regular customers. Foreign flour, because of the lack of fixed orders, the owners insisted on selling high. It is said that they have made some concessions yesterday. The opened price of the high brand was 19 yuan and 5 jiao, and the median price was around 19 yuan. 400 to 500 bags were purchased from this street. The street's retail sales of Chinese factory flour amounted to about 10,000 bags.

Wheat: Yesterday's market conditions were quiet as usual. The domestic and foreign sources were quiet, and the amount of goods transported to the concession was even more sparse. Chinese factories and inland gangs did not pay attention to purchasing because there were no goods to buy, except for several white bags of goods directly delivered to Japanese factories.

### Securities, Jardine Brewery New Shares, Subscriptions Up to Nine Times Over, Domestic Debt Has Started a Small Rebound

The unofficial securities market started a rebound yesterday. The market has gradually eased over the past few days, and the bullish gangs have gradually emerged. Most of them have made profits from the price increase, and the current price is still high. The bulls are not sure. There is no shortage of shorts. The market price is slowly falling. But yesterday's trading, both sides were quite strong. It is unknown who will win this competition. Although gold opened yesterday, there were no transactions, so the crowd at the bond meeting was getting more crowded, and trading was still quite lively. At the opening yesterday morning, both the Bing and Wu types immediately broke the 60 yuan mark, but soon declined. Tongkang was buying very enthusiastically. Baochang, Yongkang, Renchang, and Lianyi all had demand. Yuxing and Hongda both sold in large quantities. Hengfu and Yichang also emerged. The afternoon closing was slightly small at 0.23 jiao. In the afternoon, Tongkang continued to buy, but Yu's sales were still surging, and Hongda also sold a lot. The rest, such as Lianhe, Yichang, Shengda, and Shunchang, were selling with the wind. After holding on for a long time, the multiple parties were defeated and fled. Type A broke into 8 yuan, and Type B broke into 2 yuan. As a result, they unanimously continued to fall by 0.65 to 0.95 yuan. The total transaction volume was still 2.56 million yuan. A brief table is listed below.

London, 23rd (Wednesday): This morning, the listed market prices for foreign debt and Far East British company stocks were still flat. Only bank stocks showed fluctuations. Jardine Matheson Bank shares rose 2 shillings and 6 pence, priced at 7 pounds. HSBC Bank London registered shares fell 1 pound, priced at 61 pounds. The Hong Kong registered shares did not move, still standing at 57 pounds. There were prices but no market. The rest were unchanged.

Stock transactions: 100 shares of Tianchu MSG factory were traded, priced at 86 yuan and 5 jiao.

Jardine Matheson & Co. issued 500,000 shares of Jardine Brewery stock, totaling 3 million yuan. The subscription amount was 27 million yuan, a ratio of 1 to 9, indicating that those with funds are absorbing foreign shares. Also, in view of the previous high subscription of Xinyi and Zhaoshang stocks, the allotment was distributed on a pro rata basis. Therefore, those who decided to subscribe for shares reserved a place and subscribed for additional shares so that they could get more shares when they were allocated.

Yesterday, the public stock market did not change much. The underlying trend was smear. Trading was scarce throughout the day, because the public still has expectations. However, as soon as the prices of the famous stocks fell, the multiple parties were motivated to buy. Among the various stocks, only Hui Defeng has made some progress. The rest are flat. Rubber stocks are relatively dark, because investors are waiting for the announcement of interest from various companies, so that they can make a decision. The new shares of Jardine Brewery are very popular, and the number of over-subscriptions is nine times over. This is enough to show that the amount of working capital in the current market is truly astonishing. Therefore, if the news turns better, this type of capital can be used for market investment. On the contrary, its resistance is also strong.

### Oil Market, Movement to Move Out Permits, Oil Has No Way Out, Raw Soybean Oil Down by One or Two Yuan

Yesterday's edible oil market was gradually weakening. It is estimated that more than 100 dan of oil from Trading Great Factory were traded, priced at 85 yuan and 2.5 jiao, which is a drop of one yuan compared to the previous day. Qing Qi soybean oil was traded for 30 pieces, priced at 75 yuan. Jiaozhou soybean oil was traded for 40 pieces, priced at 74.5 to 74 yuan, which is relatively flat. Peanut oil prices fell sharply, spot goods were down by one or two yuan, and futures plunged by three or four yuan. (It is estimated that 200 pieces of Jiaozhou spot oil were priced at 70 yuan to 69 yuan, 100 pieces of road goods were priced at 71 yuan, 300 pieces were traded in November at 72 yuan to 71.5 yuan, 200 pieces were traded in December at 72.5 yuan to 72 yuan, 500 barrels of Qingdao oil for delivery in November were priced at 101.5 yuan to 99 yuan, 1,200 barrels for delivery in November were priced at 103 yuan to 100 yuan, and 50 pieces of Yantai raw oil were priced at 69.5 yuan). The reason is that over 3,000 moving-out permits were produced, but the inland areas have been solved by the Jiangbei oil transport. Therefore, although moving-out permits continue to be issued, the sales market is still waiting. Moreover, the current costs have been increased by taxes. How can the overall situation develop? According to the current trend, speculation will backfire, or it may awaken the dream. However, some powerful people are still holding on and waiting for an opportunity to act.

On the 25th, there were 205 bags of soybeans, 150 pieces of soybean oil, 250 bags of sesame seeds, 200 tins of sesame oil, 50 bags of raw kernels, and 200 tins of raw oil shipped to Hong Kong.

### Sugar Market, Sugar Sluggish Again

The trend of the sugar market yesterday was that with the recovery of foreign exchange rates, both coarse white and refined sugar saw declines, and red sugar was also soft. Only Dutch red sugar did not change. The trade association's cleared market price for spot 24 coarse white was 74 yuan for goods stored in warehouses of sugar companies and 70.5 yuan for goods stored in warehouses of other companies, down 0.5 yuan. Taikoo refined white B grade stored at the west warehouse was 72.5 yuan, down 0.2 yuan. DY mark stored at the east warehouse was 68.4 yuan, down 0.4 yuan. HX mark coarse red stored at the west warehouse was 5.45 yuan. Dutch red spot goods were 55.5 yuan to 55.8 yuan, and road goods were 55.3 yuan. No. 1 rock sugar from this factory was 94.5 yuan, and Jingming rock sugar was 96 yuan.

On the 24th, 4,750 bags of imported sugar arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong.

### Finance
First Day of Cash Forward Trading: Transactions Pathetically Scarce, Fluctuating Only Ten Yuan Up or Down in the Afternoon

Yesterday, cash clam red [a type of currency] commenced as usual with spot forward transactions, with a half-month term. It is said that if there is no delivery upon expiration, the term can be extended to the end of the month for settlement. Throughout the entire day, the price rose and then plummeted sharply, with no vitality in the market and scarce transactions. The total volume for the entire day was just over one thousand taels, and the afternoon was even quieter, fluctuating only ten yuan up or down. The final settlement was five thousand seven hundred and sixty yuan, a slight decrease of seventy yuan compared to the closing price last weekend. The price of gold jewelry in silver shops remained unchanged, and customs gold remained stable.

Fluctuations Exceeded One Hundred Yuan

In the early morning, the “number gang” aggressively raised prices, with the opening price rising to five thousand eight hundred and fifty yuan. Silver firms initially did ten taels of matching trades. Soon after, securities firms and silver firms sold short, and the price immediately collapsed. It is estimated that the silver clearinghouse released twenty taels of gold at five thousand seven hundred and seventy yuan. Later, currency exchange businesses slightly absorbed, taking in ten taels from silver firms, and the price rebounded to five thousand eight hundred yuan. However, gold firms and securities firms heavily sold, lacking counterparties, and transactions became stagnant, causing the price to fall again. Securities firms pushed twenty taels onto silver firms, driving the price down to five thousand seven hundred and fifty yuan. Subsequently, silver firms bought ten taels from gold firms, causing a slight increase of twenty-odd yuan to five thousand seven hundred and seventy-five yuan. The noon closing saw silver firms matching ten taels at just five thousand seven hundred and sixty yuan. The market was quiet, with no fluctuations after the closing either. When the afternoon session opened, currency exchange businesses entered ten taels into silver firms, quoting five thousand seven hundred and fifty-five yuan. The trading floor was even less exciting, with extremely minimal activity. Silver firms matched ten taels, and the price fell again to five thousand seven hundred and fifty yuan. Finally, silver firms took in ten taels from currency exchange businesses at five thousand seven hundred and sixty yuan, the closing price last night, down seventy yuan from last Saturday's closing. The daily fluctuation was one hundred yuan. The selling price of cash firm's base brand gold, when sold in the style of clam red, was more than ten yuan higher, while the buying price was thirty yuan lower. The current posted price of gold was fifty or sixty yuan lower, and hardly any trading occurred.

The Price of Gold Jewelry Remained Unchanged

The selling price of gold jewelry in silver shops remained unchanged. Datong Hang still quoted six hundred yuan per tael.

### A Warning to Shanghai's "Second Landlords"

— Ding Ren

"It's not easy to live in Shanghai." Lately, I've been feeling pressured by my "boss," with a sense of "the mountain is about to come, the wind fills the tower." However, I haven't "experienced" sleeping on the streets in my life, so I have no choice but to grit my teeth, stand tall, and shoulder the heavy burden—my family—while also having to choose to live in a cheaper house. At the same time, in order to save on transportation costs and lunch money, I have no choice but to choose a place close to where I work. Therefore, I keep "circling" around that area.

Now, everyone knows that finding a house is not easy, so as soon as you see a red slip of paper, you rush towards it like a hunting dog seeing a rabbit, chasing and searching. However, due to the "exquisite eyes" of these businessmen, it's not a "rental advertisement" but an "advertisement," so the person looking at it hangs their head again, feeling disappointed. In fact, second landlords, in order to "capitalize on scarcity," post rental advertisements far away, even one or two li away. The intention of the second landlord is nothing more than to choose tenants, "wait for the price to rise," in order to make a "motherfucking" killing!

But it's hard for friends looking for a house! When second landlords post rental advertisements, in order to widely collect, once they find a "treasure," they are not responsible. They never think to tear down the rental advertisements they posted everywhere, causing people looking for a house to run unnecessary errands, which is really hateful, like a friend who's starving picking up cold rice only to find an empty can.

Here, I have to ask the second landlords to "have mercy"! You blacken your conscience with coal ash, relying on houses to live is not enough, you also have to make fun of others. You should know that other people's shoes and socks are all bought with money, and other people's spirit, energy, and time are also priceless treasures. Don't think that just because your life is settled, you can take pleasure in making fun of people, and enjoy yourselves by "eating houses" and "wearing houses"!

Please second landlords, take a look, such Shanghai will soon be a thing of the past, and your time to "enjoy yourselves with houses" will not be long either. The surrounding evil waves will not allow you to continue like this, and the support of the isolated island still depends on the four million Chinese compatriots. May second landlords repent as soon as possible, so that everyone can cross the river safely in the same boat. Because taking care of everyone is also taking care of yourself; reducing rent and reducing trouble is reducing the opposition between landlords and tenants, which is also stabilizing a basic force of the isolated island. I hope the landlords of Shanghai can choose this best strategy!

### The Fate of the Dance Queen

— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter 10: The Shoe Problem

She said this, looking at me. I didn't answer, but nodded, letting her continue.

She paused slightly, then continued: "It was on that day—that is, the night before yesterday, the 17th—that the shameless thing happened. It was already two or three o'clock after midnight, and I was already sound asleep when I suddenly heard the sound of something glass breaking. I was suddenly startled awake. Then I heard Miss Wang's shouting. I knew something was wrong, so I quickly got out of bed, put on a piece of clothing, and rushed to the second floor. Miss Wang's door was closed, but there was no light in the room. When I got to her door, I could still hear footsteps on the floor, as if someone was struggling there. Miss Wang was still shouting, but the shouting was very low, as if her mouth was blocked by something, and she couldn't shout.

"I was terrified, wanting to go in, but I didn't have the courage. I thought maybe there was some robber or thief. I stood at her door, mustered all my strength, and shouted: 'Miss Wang!' The door suddenly opened, and a man rushed out, bumping into me and knocking me over. Of course, I couldn't recognize who that person was in the dark, but I vaguely saw him wearing a white short shirt, running towards the third floor."

"Before long, the lights in the room came on, and Master Li also came down from the third floor, hurriedly walking into Miss Wang's room. I followed him in and saw Miss Wang sitting on the edge of the bed crying, the front of her white Indian silk nightgown already torn. A glass vase on the dressing table had been smashed on the floor, the bedding on the bed was scattered, and a small square stool had also fallen over.

"Master Li patted Miss Wang's shoulder and said in a low voice: 'Ah Bao, don't cry, this beast is too shameless, I'll tell him to get lost right away. Look at my face, don't be angry.' Miss Wang was still covering her face and crying. Master Li also turned his head to look at me. 'Jinmei, go upstairs and sleep, nothing's wrong.' At that time, I couldn't say anything, I could only obey him and go back to the third floor. I went into my room, of course I still couldn't sleep. Before long, I heard Master Li also go back into his room. The two of them then whispered and talked secretly. Although my room was only separated from them by a plaster-coated partition wall, even if I put my ear against the wall, I couldn't hear anything.

"I realized what was going on and knew that this cousin was not a good person. I was afraid that he would do something else, so I didn't dare to sleep that night. But until dawn, there were no other movements. Yesterday morning at around seven o'clock, Master Li accompanied his son out, saying that he was taking his son to the train to go back to Suzhou. Before leaving, this Shouqi didn't even say goodbye to Miss Wang. In fact, at this time, Miss Wang's door hadn't even been opened yet, maybe she was still sleeping." She said this, looking towards the window again.

### Record of the Youth Association's Admission of Free Members to the Junior Department

— Qingchuan

The Junior Department of the Youth Association on Sichuan Road, in view of the current spiritual distress and economic difficulties faced by employees in general commercial and industrial circles, who are unable to enjoy proper leisure and activities, has specially piloted the admission of free members from commercial and industrial circles. Beforehand, few people knew about it, and a total of thirty-four people applied. Although their levels varied, and some did not meet the standards, all were admitted in order to encourage young people to be progressive. The most valuable aspect of this decision at the trial was that the genuine and sincere words in the writings of the thirty-odd people revealed their inner thoughts and told us about the difficulties faced by ordinary commercial and industrial workers in making a living with low wages. Below is a statistic obtained from the test papers:

Age: 23 people are 17 years old

7 people are over 16 years old

3 people are 15 years old

1 person is 14 years old

Education Level: 17 people have junior high school education (including one graduate)

14 people have upper primary school education

3 people have lower primary school education

Salary: 3 people earn between 20 and 30 yuan

11 people earn between 10 and 20 yuan

16 people earn between 5 and 10 yuan

4 people earn less than 5 yuan

Positions: Includes sixteen categories such as miscellaneous affairs, stamps, typesetting, printing, accounting, drawing, bill of lading, cargo handling, book and newspaper sales, proofing, and printing film copies.

The above is just a rough outline to give readers some idea of the situation of working youth struggling for a livelihood.

Young people under the age of twenty are at a time when their desire for knowledge is particularly strong, and their development is not yet fully sound. Like a flower waiting to bloom and release its fragrance, they should be cared for and nurtured so that they can bear rich fruits in the future. However, in fact, many young people, compelled by economic pressure, go to shops or into factories in their teens!

In today's world of expensive rice and firewood, it is not easy to cover personal expenses with a meager monthly income. Some even have to subsidize their families and support their elderly mothers. How can they allocate it?

They frankly point out their dissatisfaction with their treatment, not only with their wages, but also with many of the leisure benefits they should be entitled to. They very much hope to be able to improve. I believe there are many far-sighted people in the commercial and industrial world who can understand the distress of ordinary working youth and sympathize with them!

Everyone must live, and only a life that is lived well is meaningful. Especially for young people, whose minds are active and whose actions are lively, they must be given reasonable satisfaction. The Junior Department of the Youth Association takes serving society as its mission and is piloting the admission of free members from commercial and industrial circles, so that young people who have the will but lack the means can get some spiritual comfort in their spare time and enjoy the same benefits as other members. However, this is just the beginning, and if there are considerable achievements in the future, we will definitely recruit more people.

Finally, I must sincerely encourage the young people who are struggling in suffering. What the country and society will need in the future is definitely us, not the playboys who are obsessed with dance halls and spend thousands of dollars at a time. Work hard!

### The Dionne Quintuplets Begin Their Education

— Qinghui

Time flies like a stream. In an instant, the Dionne quintuplets are already of school age. For their future, their current education has become a very important matter. Now, let me introduce their school life:

Curriculum

The subjects that the quintuplets should be taught were planned by the Canadian government two years ago. Now, they are learning the most important lesson: service. Dr. Dafoe told them the only motto: "Responsibility first, private affairs second." Although they have many nurses and servants to serve them, they have to do two things themselves. After class, they have to organize their books and keep their desks clean. In addition, they are required to have three hours of classes every day. The teaching method focuses on their thinking, avoiding rote memorization. They like to listen to fairy tales and love to draw. They read English three times a week and practice music three times a week. The afternoon is for rest and games.

Classroom Decoration

In their classroom, all the decorations are exactly the same as the equipment of Old Wells. A set of exquisite toys, a bright red carpet. Several paintings hang on the left wall. One is a gift from the British Emperor. It depicts many children, rabbits, squirrels, small crows, wildflowers, etc. It is the most interesting world of childhood. On the right wall hangs a clock and photos of the quintuplets, as well as an oil painting of Dr. Dafoe. What makes the quintuplets most happy is the strange music chair. When someone sits on it, it will make a "coco dong dong" sound.

New Disciplinary Method

In the past, because the quintuplets were still young, there were no specific disciplinary measures. But now that they are older, a "quiet room" has been specially opened. This "quiet room" is eight feet long and six feet wide. It is very bright and the air is circulating. It is the same as the other rooms in the nursery. There is only a table, a chair, and a few picture books in the room. Everything is very comfortable. Do not leave the offending child alone in the room, separated from the rest of the sisters, so that she feels lonely and achieves the purpose of discipline.

Extracurricular activities

The quintuplets like group life very much. Therefore, they often hold a small tea party and symposium recently. Dr. Dafoe is working as a mentor to help them develop their intelligence. When the weather is sunny, Dr. Dafoe often takes the children to play in the wild. He uses interesting ways, the style of stories, and simple and clear explanations of everything in nature, so that they can gain rich knowledge.

### Group Photo of the Quintuplets, Students Three Years Ago

### Dan Duyu Talks About "Four Hundred Million Lovers"

(Hong Kong Correspondence) The moving film title "Four Hundred Million Lovers" has aroused the concern of many audiences who love domestic films. Is it a Cantonese film or a Mandarin film? What is the story about? What about the cast and the director? A reporter from Zhongyi News Agency specially visited Mr. Dan Duyu, the film's production director, who told the following:

Mr. Dan said: Many people think that "Four Hundred Million Lovers" is one of those love-filled and funny films that the southern film circle is particularly promoting, or a lighthearted love work wrapped in some patriotic sugar coating. In fact, the title of this film is just the name of a theme song in this work, but the entire work cleverly weaves a touching story of four hundred million Chinese children striving for the final victory in the great era. Miss Lu Ming, as the center of this work, is a representative of the "pursuer of freedom" among the four hundred million Chinese children. This is her first Mandarin fashion film after coming to Hong Kong. All the actors who participated in the performance are a group of artists with the best acting records, such as Li Jingbo, Jiang Junchao, Zhao Yishan, and Zheng Qiuzi of the Wuhan Chorus. Finally, Mr. Dan also said: Mr. Hu Chunbing has poured countless efforts into this film, so the harvest is also extremely brilliant.

### Chen Yunshang Will Star in Two More Films This Year · Busy with Work, Others Are Cutting Ribbons

After Chen Yunshang finished "Xiangjiang Autumn Rain," she continued to star in "Su Wu Herding Sheep." A reporter from Haixing News Agency inquired about the planned new films, and she replied that the company had decided to produce twelve new works within three months. It is said that she will be assigned to star in two films. Therefore, she has been working hard to shoot "Su Wu Herding Sheep" recently. This film must be completed before the eleventh of next month. She was also asked: "Miss Chen, news of you cutting ribbons for dance halls has been seen from time to time. Won't you be even busier?" Chen smiled and replied to the reporter: "This matter is very ridiculous. In this month, I have been resting at home except for work, and I have been trying to politely decline all social engagements. For the sake of my health, I have to do so. I am unable to help with the ribbon-cutting. Recently, an advertisement for the opening of a new dance hall was published with me cutting the ribbon. I had never talked to them about it beforehand. Even Mr. Zhang Shankun did not know about it at all. The three characters of Chen Yunshang are not a registered trademark. It must be someone else. However, there have been several other requests for me to cut the ribbon recently, but I have politely declined them all due to work reasons!"

### Recent News from the Accompaniment Capital's Electric Company

— Xinfang

The Education Film Department of Chongqing Central University recently sent three cameramen to enter Xikang along the Jinsha River to take various valuable newsreels, including a total of seven rolls. Two of them were shot in Ya'an, an important gateway to Kang, and Kangding, the capital of Xikang Province. One roll is entirely a record of the residents of Xikang. The other four rolls were shot along the way.

This newsreel is currently being edited and will be sent to various places at home and abroad for screening in the near future.

Recently, the department also sent two capable personnel to the border of Sichuan to take pictures of the local tribal people. There is also a 400-foot-long film, the content of which is a mine, and an educational film about how tung oil is extracted, manufactured, and exported, all of which have been prepared. In addition, a cartoon film alluding to the current Sino-Japanese war has long been completed, titled "Spider and Bee."

Since its inception, although the department has only been around for eleven years, it has already gained a global reputation. The film "A Day in the Countryside" won the third prize at the International Exhibition held in Brussels, Kyoto, Belgium. What is worthy of pride is that the American cultural institutions have repeatedly sent letters to the department requesting to provide films about certain aspects of Chinese people's lives.

### Musical Concert to be Held at Aurora University Tomorrow Night

The auditorium of Aurora University will hold a grand harmonica and accordion concert at 8:30 pm on the 26th. The performers are the Mass Harmonica and Accordion United Team led by harmonica player Mr. Shi Renwang. In addition to the five famous pieces performed by a hundred people, there will also be Mr. Shi's harmonica solo "Selection from The Merry Widow," Mr. Cai and Mr. Zhu's "Tales from the Vienna Woods" accordion duet, Miss Shi Hailun's "Poet and Peasant Overture," and a harmonica solo. The program is extremely wonderful.

### "Soul-Leaving Tune" and "Soul-Pulling Melody"

— Su Shaoqing

My hometown, Xuzhou, has a local opera called "Soul-Pulling Melody." Ten people form a troupe, and in the past, they made a living by singing at village and town temple fairs. Since the railway was opened, there have also been traces of them next to the Xuzhou Railway Station. One person plays the drum and clapper, one person plays the small gong, one person plays the clapper. One person plays the long-shaped moon lute, two or three people play the roles of sheng, clown, and miscellaneous, also wearing beards and colorful clothes, but not wearing boots. Two or three people play the roles of dan, called "baotou," wearing fake buns, paper flowers, rouge, women's shirts and pants, but they must step on clogs under their feet. This is a special feature. This kind of fake golden lotus does not appear on the stage, but walks on the ground and sand. Their faces are dark, purely local. However, their art really has unique aspects. The stories they sing include Zhu Yingtai, the Lanqiao Meeting, and Peach Blossom Girl. Ten years ago, I heard a famous dan role sing Peach Blossom Girl (that is, the Yuan Dynasty opera "Peach Blossom Girl Fights Magic with Duke Zhou"). The singing method, expression, walking, and acrobatics were all excellent and worth watching. The tune they sing is the "Soul-Pulling Melody." Since I heard this tune, I have never forgotten the name of the tune. "Soul-Pulling" is aptly named. My soul has probably been pulled away. Unexpectedly, yesterday I accidentally heard a Suzhou girl singing storytelling, and I encountered the "Soul-Leaving Tune" again. It can be said that there is no coincidence. Although the north and south are different in culture and civilization, their ability to "shock the heart" is the same. Now I will describe the "Soul-Leaving Tune."

Xu Xuelou and Xu Xuehua are the female disciples of Xu Xuexing, a storyteller, and the junior sisters of Xu Xueyue. A friend knows them and has repeatedly said that their art is very beautiful. I went to the Nanjing Hotel to listen to them. By the time I arrived, they had already finished singing and left the stage. I was invited to sit in their apartment. Xuexing ordered the two sisters, Xuelou and Xuehua, to sing a song called "Chopping the Sutra Hall" in front of them. One plays the moon lute and one plays the pipa. They stretch their fingers to gently pluck and slowly twist. They open their cherry lips to gently sing. The fun of Dongshan silk and bamboo music, I have already enjoyed it. When they sang the words of Princess Yuying hearing that Wu Han wanted to kill her, they suddenly changed to a low tune. The sorrow was gentle and very moving. This is the "bian zheng (sound paper)" sound that the ancients called. I was surprised by this. After the song ended, I learned from Confucius's example of "asking about everything in the ancestral temple" and asked, "Does the tune that changed to a low tone just now have a special name?" Xuexing replied, "This is the Soul-Leaving Tune." I said, "Is that so? It can be called the same as my hometown's 'Soul-Pulling Melody.' They are both sounds that startle the soul and awaken the spleen. Moreover, they are beautiful Suzhou girls, in their blossoming years. Their sandalwood mouths and oriole voices emit this wonderful sound? How many people in front of the wine are not separated from their bodies? The tune name 'Soul-Leaving' is elegant and novel, and must be recorded. Combined with my hometown's 'Soul-Pulling Melody,' Xuelou sings male roles, acting as the first hand. Her voice is like the reeds of a sheng, and also like the wrinkled transparency of mountain rocks, and the tinkling of mountain springs. She is a natural beautiful throat, with a beautiful and pleasant sound, similar to the vocal cords of the Peking opera female role Xue Yanqin. It is a pity that she did not learn Peking opera, otherwise, I would definitely be able to stand out. Her face should be beautiful and charming, with two exceptionally deep dimples on her cheeks, which is rare in the world. Her charm probably comes from this. She is truly the most beautiful of the Suzhou girls. I heard that she is also good at expressing herself on stage. Xuehua sings female roles and is also very good. There are also two young girls, also from Suzhou, named Xuemei and Xuefang. They are both intelligent and are learning. They also sing a song called "Daiyu Burning Manuscripts" to entertain the guests. I think in a few years, the two girls will definitely take off. I have heard the voices of actors in opera families singing operas, which is common and not surprising. But as someone who knows a little about storytelling, I unexpectedly obtained this auditory pleasure. It is really the first time I have broken the topic. When I returned, I took up my pen and wrote it down. The soft Suzhou accent is still lingering in my ears!
