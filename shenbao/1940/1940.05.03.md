### The Nationalist Army Recovers Ruicheng in Southern Shanxi; Remnants of the Japanese Army Retreat to the Vicinity of Maojin Ferry and are Heavily Besieged; The Southern Section of the Linjin Highway is Cut Off

Xingji: More than 3,000 Japanese troops who converged from Xiaxian, Anyi, Yuncheng, and other places to invade southward were encircled and severely decimated by the Nationalist army in the Dongpu area east of Ruicheng, suffering extremely heavy casualties. The Nationalist army took advantage of the momentum to advance directly to Ruicheng, fiercely attacking the city walls. On the evening of the 26th, the Japanese army could not withstand the assault and retreated in disarray towards Shangxiacao Village and Dongbi. They then coordinated with the Japanese troops at the 25 Ridges in Monan Town, attempting to resist stubbornly. After the Nationalist army recovered Ruicheng, a powerful unit immediately actively pursued and殲滅ed the remnants of the Japanese army. Another group of more than 4,000 Japanese troops was lured by the Nationalist army to the vicinity of Maojin Ferry and fell into a heavy siege, resulting in almost complete annihilation after the Nationalist army's relentless assault.

The Nationalist army transferred a large force to the southern line of the mountain. The Japanese troops then successively occupied Guwang, Jiwang, Dongxi Yancun, Guocun, Yandi, Shizigou, and various strongholds south of Maojiashan. On the 23rd, they further invaded Wangyuan Village east of Yandi. Seeing that the Japanese troops had fallen into the Nationalist army's encirclement, the Nationalist army launched a full-scale general offensive on the 24th. By the 27th, the Japanese troops had been cut into several sections. The strongholds of Yandi, Shizigou, and other places defended by the Japanese were successively captured by the Nationalist army. On the 28th, the Nationalist army, with the momentum of victory, followed up with a mop-up operation, engaging in bloody battles for two days and nights. Miaoao, Yaodian, Guwang, Jiwang, and other places were once again in Nationalist hands. On the 30th, the Nationalist army continued to capture Dongxi Yancun and Huixia Village. The fighting strength of the Japanese troops had completely waned by this point. A small number of remnant Japanese troops have been surrounded by layers of Nationalist forces. Currently, the large Nationalist army on both sides of the highway is using a mobile deployment to encircle and attack the Japanese troops from multiple directions, flanking them from left and right. The entire force of the Japanese troops invading southward has been completely disintegrated, and their dream of sweeping through Zhongtiao Mountain for the eleventh time has become a vain illusion.

### Nationalist Army in Southern Anhui Fiercely Attacks Datong and Fanchang, Threatening Japanese Transportation Between Nanjing and Wuhu; Lingyang Town and Other Places Have Been Recovered

Chongqing: Today, a Nationalist army spokesperson stated that the Japanese army, attempting to expand its occupied areas and protect transportation along the Yangtze River, launched a three-pronged general offensive against Nationalist army positions in southern Anhui on April 24th. Subsequently, within a few days, they occupied Fanchang, Nanling, and Qingyang. When the Japanese army reached these three cities, there was no major battle because the Nationalist army had already adopted the strategy of allowing the Japanese army to penetrate deep and then disrupting their rear. At the same time, because the Japanese army occupied Fanchang, Nanling, and Qingyang, the Nationalist army was able to advance to the outskirts of Wuhu, threatening Japanese transportation between Nanjing, Wuhu, and other Anhui cities, forcing the Japanese army to rush around in an attempt to defend these cities. Chinese troops are fiercely attacking towns and cities on the south bank of the Yangtze River such as Datong and Fanchang, making it difficult for the Japanese army to defend their newly occupied positions.

Editorial

### Foreign Exchange and Legal Tender

Yesterday, the foreign exchange market experienced unprecedented turmoil. The market situation in the morning was chaotic, and the fluctuations in exchange rates were so wide that they defied normal logic. The exchange rate for British pounds shrank to 3 shillings and 25 pence, on par with the lowest exchange rate on August 11th of last year. The exchange rate for US dollars shrank to 4 yuan 6 jiao and 7.5 fen, which was an unprecedentedly high price, but the actual transaction price was even higher than this figure. As for the price of gold, it rose by 1,000 yuan, with the highest call price reaching 7,000 yuan. Other commodities such as cotton yarn also rose by 200 yuan, with each bale reaching a high price of more than 1,700 yuan. The demand for cash was so high that the discount rate was as high as 230 yuan. Credit became increasingly tight, and the interest rate for interbank lending also increased by about one point per month. Commodities such as rice, grain, oil, and beans all rose sharply in price due to speculation. What exactly is the reason for this? Upon observing the Reuters dispatch in yesterday's evening newspaper that American businessmen in Shanghai were requesting the US government to provide a financial loan to China to stabilize the financial situation, we can infer that in Shanghai's feverishly speculative market, someone must have stirred up a great disturbance. Speculators like to look for news in the cracks, and they always argue from the opposite perspective; the distance in time and the difference in rise and fall are the speculators' fields of profit. After yesterday's great change, many were elated, but few were disheartened. However, the vast majority of ordinary people saw their burdens increased many times over; one family rejoices, while the whole street cries, which is a true reflection of today's Shanghai society.

Why is foreign exchange shrinking? It means that foreign currencies are becoming more expensive and the legal tender is becoming cheaper. Why is foreign exchange shrinking? Everyone has a different opinion. Considering that it shrank to such an extreme degree, it can be asserted that there is absolutely no real reason for foreign currencies to suddenly become more expensive, and there is no genuine reason for the legal tender to suddenly become cheaper. Analyzing the main reason, it is nothing more than internal traitors and external enemies manipulating public sentiment in this economic war to profit from it. The focus of manipulating public sentiment lies in undermining the legal tender, and in shaking the legal tender system and belief in it. But is the legal tender really shaken? To the general public, the repeated shrinking of foreign exchange is equivalent to the repeated decline of legal tender. How can it not be shaken? If it were not shaken, why did the foreign exchange market not increase the supply of foreign exchange yesterday, but instead allow the market to freely introduce and withdraw chips for trading, leading to rumors that the Sino-British Exchange Equalisation Fund Committee would no longer intervene in the Shanghai black market for foreign exchange, and why did American businessmen request the US government to come forward and maintain the financial situation? It must be known that all of this is assessing the value of currency based on the currency itself, and mistakenly taking it as a shake in the legal tender itself. In fact, whether the legal tender itself is shaken depends on whether the legal tender reserve fund is adequate. Whether the legal tender reserve fund is adequate cannot be judged by the amount of gold, silver, and bills of exchange; the so-called gold, silver, and bills of exchange are not currency materials, but currency, and are not sufficient to serve as a measure of currency. Tracing back to the establishment of the legal tender system in China, the legal tender has already become an integral part of the national wealth, and its course is aligned with the national fortune. In other words, the ups and downs of China's national fortune directly affect the legal tender and become a clear direct proportion; China is in a hard-fought war of resistance, and the legal tender is in the midst of a storm; China will win the victory and be rebuilt, and the legal tender will also prosper. Therefore, saying that the legal tender will become like the imperial Russian ruble or the German mark after the First World War, which are equivalent to waste paper, is absolutely unimaginable. More specifically, the legal tender takes products as its measure, and products are the source of the legal tender. China is fortunate to possess endless treasures, and is also fortunate that the current war of resistance is still in an agricultural country with underdeveloped production, which is very different from a capitalist industrial country with all industries thriving; therefore, China's wealth will never be destroyed and will continue to grow. To use a small analogy to illustrate a large concept, it is like a farmer whose crops cannot be burned completely and cannot be stolen completely. There may be a time of hardship when the old crops have been depleted and the new crops have not yet been harvested, but when the autumn harvest arrives, there will be plenty of food and clothing again, and the suffering will come to an end. Therefore, short-term difficulties during the war are not surprising and are not to be worried about; as long as the government and the people work together to develop production, then any method can be used to acquire an endless amount of foreign currency, which means that there is no need to worry about the legal tender's reserve being depleted.

According to what we have heard, the legal tender exchange stabilization fund still meets the necessary standard. Some may think that the authorities' failure to maintain the Shanghai black market for foreign exchange is a sign that the exchange stabilization fund is depleted, but that is a big mistake. Maintaining the Shanghai black market for foreign exchange is no different from providing supplies to thieves. If you want to break the conspiracy to exploit and sabotage the legal tender, then it is better to let the foreign exchange in Shanghai be supplied and demanded on its own without maintaining it. Furthermore, recalling the past, the Exchange Equalisation Fund still secretly maintained the previous two foreign exchange contractions, so who knows whether the Chinese authorities are not taking appropriate measures to ease the pain in life caused by the general public's slightly higher prices. Even taking the positions of Britain and the United States as an example, the Chinese legal tender is originally tied to the British pound, and the Hong Kong and Shanghai financial markets are interdependent. The British are busy with the war and do not have time to take care of other things, but they will never easily give up their economic power in the Far East. Even if Britain has to give it up, someone will definitely rise up to replace it. The United States has no determination to maintain its rights and interests in the Far East, but if it does, it will never stand idly by regarding China's entire economy. Considering the two previous credit loans to China, we can already see the sincerity of the United States. The Reuters dispatch the day before yesterday said that the United States is cautious, not that it is indifferent; the United States supporting China is actually suppressing Japan, and helping China is actually helping itself, which is well known to the insightful people of the United States.

As for speculators and those who only protect their own interests and disregard the overall situation, it is truly unknown where their vision lies. Their intentions are despicable, their hearts are punishable, and their vision is even shorter. They are Chinese, and their property is in China, so how can they escape completely? Even if they convert all their assets into foreign currency, can today's foreign currency really remain unchanged for a long time? They are undermining the legal tender, throwing stones down the well of the legal tender, and not caring about damaging the legal tender, but the legal tender is still what they use to calculate their profits and losses. How can their ignorance and contradiction be described? However, we do not forgive them for their ignorance and contradiction as being insignificant; we still want to warn them: the more speculation, the more evasion, the greater the damage to the legal tender. The legal tender will certainly have a bright future, but unfortunately, if it is damaged, China's economic vitality will be hit; others are trying to sabotage it every day but cannot, but we are blindly acting, opening the door, and giving people the opportunity to attack; then, regardless of whether it finally remains unharmed, the speculator's behavior is, in essence, destroying the national financial system, and its crime is absolutely unforgivable.

In addition to the above, please allow me to add a few more words. Recently, the prices of all local goods have risen following the prices of foreign goods, but local goods are still cheaper; therefore, the more foreign goods people buy and prepare, the more affected they are by the shrinking of foreign exchange. Anyone who wants to avoid the impact only needs to vigorously promote local goods; this is one point. The black market for foreign exchange in Shanghai is not enough to represent the exchange rate, and it is not enough to represent the interior and the whole country; in other words, one should not measure everything with the vision, feeling, and concept of a corner of Shanghai; this is the second point. Shanghai is still an important international trading center, and only this port remains where foreign merchants in coastal China can trade freely. If foreign exchange shrinks frequently and imported goods become very expensive, it will be difficult for ordinary Chinese people to buy them, and foreign firms will also close their doors and leave, and the losses cannot be calculated. Because today's Shanghai market is rich in international character, the way to properly handle and defend Shanghai's financial situation is not only a matter for the Chinese, but also for the Chinese and foreign merchants in Shanghai to plan and deal with together.

### Chamberlain's Report to the House of Commons: Current Status of the Norwegian Campaign: Military Plans Not Yet Complete: British Army Changes Planned Strategy

London: Prime Minister Chamberlain, responding to the public's desire, addressed the House of Commons today regarding the current state of the Norwegian campaign. The Prime Minister asked the Members of Parliament to be patient before he could give a detailed account, as military plans and movements are currently incomplete and therefore cannot be disclosed. The Prime Minister stated, "Today, I can only give a temporary statement. However, I hope Mr. Churchill and I will be able to give a more detailed account early next week. At that time, the House will undoubtedly wish to debate the entire matter based on the information available." About a month ago, the government decided to order a small number of troops to prepare everything so that if Germany took aggressive action against southern Norway, they could set sail and occupy the western Norwegian ports upon receiving orders. Any action planned by the government was conditional on Germany first violating Norway's neutrality. The House will certainly recall that three months ago, the government prepared to send Allied forces to Finland. The possibility of reaching Finland depended on the assistance of the Norwegian and Swedish governments. We felt that even if they tacitly allowed the Allies to pass through, Germany would use it as an excuse to launch an invasion, so we prepared troops to assist them in an emergency. I did not ignore this matter and anticipated that the Norwegian ports of Trondheim and Narvik, as well as the Stavanger airfield, were at risk of being bombed. Therefore, we prepared additional troops to occupy these locations. However, I must state that the orders given to the commanders of these troops stated that they could only advance and occupy these locations under one or two conditions: either they were invited by the Norwegian government, or Norwegian neutrality had already been violated. The House is aware that the governments of Norway and Sweden refused to allow troops to pass through their countries by land. After a period, most of the troops that had been concentrated were disbanded because they and the ships transporting them were needed elsewhere. However, about a month ago, the government decided to keep a small number of troops ready to occupy the western Norwegian ports upon receiving orders if Germany took aggressive action against Norway.

The Outbreak of War

Some may ask why, since Britain had this preparation, Germany was still able to take the initiative. The answer is simple: it was a long-planned and thoroughly prepared conspiracy to deal with an unsuspecting and almost defenseless people. We had known for many months that the Germans were concentrating transport ships and troops at various Baltic ports. These German troops were frequently practicing boarding and disembarking. Although it was quite clear that the Germans were planning some kind of invasion, these troops could also be used to attack Finland, Sweden, Norway, the Netherlands, or Britain, so it was impossible to determine in advance where they would strike. Even if we had known earlier that Denmark and Norway would be invaded, we could not have prevented the event without the cooperation of those two countries. However, we firmly believed that their neutrality would save them from disaster. They were completely unprepared and did not give us any warning that they were under attack. In fact, they never suspected it. We should remember that in early April, the British government decided that it could no longer tolerate Germany's continued use of Norwegian territorial waters as a supply route for iron ore and other contraband. It decided to lay mines in three locations on April 8, forcing Germany to abandon this shortcut and go out to sea in order to intercept them. What may be considered strange is that the British government's decision for this major action on April 8 almost coincided with the date chosen by Germany to launch the attack.

Destroying the Enemy Navy

The Prime Minister then recounted that on April 7, intelligence was received that a large number of German ships were moving towards the west coast of Norway and proceeding along the coast. He reiterated the battle between the British battleship Renown and the German battleship Scharnhorst, as well as the first naval battle of Narvik. He continued, "In view of the chaotic situation in central Norway and the importance of occupying Narvik, the first British force that we quickly assembled set sail directly for the Narvik area. They arrived there on April 15. By that time, the British Navy had attacked and won on April 13, completely destroying the enemy navy in the port. This made it unnecessary to use the troops originally intended to occupy Narvik. Our decision to continue operations had three objectives: (1) to do our utmost to assist Norway, (2) to resist or delay the German advance from the south, and (3) to facilitate the rescue of the Norwegian King and government." If the British army could occupy Trondheim, these objectives could be achieved very quickly, and we decided to work hard to achieve it. (Applause) Therefore, we selected two landing sites north and south of Trondheim. Today, I cannot describe in detail the fighting on these two lines after the British troops landed. All I can say at present is that our troops fought with courage and determination, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. However, the Allied forces in these two areas are now encountering serious difficulties, the most significant of which is that all available airfields have fallen into enemy hands. We had anticipated this difficulty in advance. For this reason, we were unable to use fighter planes. A few days ago, we learned that due to the German's air superiority, the artillery and tanks necessary for us to resist the enemy's attack from the south could not be transported ashore. Therefore, last week, we decided that we must abandon the plan to seize Trondheim from the south and that we must withdraw the troops in that area to another location."

Strategic Retreat

It is generally acknowledged that retreating in the face of the enemy is the most difficult military maneuver. But this time, we were very fortunate, thanks to the assistance of a powerful navy, the determination of Major General Paget, commander of the British army in the area, and the courage and alertness of our troops. We have now evacuated the entire army from Åndalsnes. Although German aircraft were constantly monitoring, to my knowledge, not a single British soldier was lost in this operation.

Casualties Not Significant

I cannot yet inform the House of the number of casualties in each battle. However, considering the scale of the operation, I dare to believe that the number of casualties is not significant. What satisfies me is that although our troops were unable to occupy Trondheim due to great difficulties, compared to the advantages held by the enemy, the advantages currently held by the Allied forces are still superior to those of the enemy.

German Objectives Not Achieved

The Prime Minister continued, "The German army initially hoped to enter Norway peacefully and occupy the entire country. Now this hope has been thwarted. After three weeks of fighting, the enemy has suffered heavy losses on land, sea, and air. The complete occupation of Norway and the large supply of iron ore previously obtained by Germany from Narvik have now been indefinitely suspended. During these three weeks, the German navy suffered heavy losses, including two battleships, three or four cruisers sunk, three of which are confirmed, eleven destroyers sunk, five submarines sunk, and a total of thirty transport and supply ships sunk, scuttled, or set on fire, resulting in thousands of lives lost. Another ten transport and supply ships were hit by torpedoes and sunk. During this period, the Royal Navy lost four destroyers, three submarines, one small warship, and five fishing boats. In addition, five warships were damaged by air attacks, and one supply ship was sunk by enemy torpedoes. Based on these figures, the Royal Navy's strength has been only slightly diminished, while the German navy has suffered enormous damage. This has altered the comparative strength of the navies and allowed the Allied main fleets to make important reallocations. Previously, we could not divide our forces to defend the Mediterranean because we needed a strong navy in the North Sea. Now we can do so. Therefore, British and French battleships, cruisers, and auxiliary ships have arrived in the eastern Mediterranean and are proceeding to Alexandria." In short, we have not achieved our objectives, but the Germans have not achieved their objectives either, and their losses are far greater than ours. (Reuters, 2nd)

### US-Japan to Continue Talks: Japanese Spokesman Denies Plot to Conclude Far East Pact

Tokyo: A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry stated today while receiving newly arrived reporters that Foreign Minister Arita's informal meeting with US Ambassador Grew on April 26 would prompt them to continue talks. However, this matter has not yet been definitely planned. On the evening of April 26, Arita invited Grew to a banquet, taking the opportunity to resume informal talks to discuss various issues between the US and Japan that had been delayed due to Foreign Minister Arita's busy schedule. The talks lasted three-quarters of an hour, but he declined to disclose the nature of the talks. Asked if the Japanese side had prepared for a meeting between US Commissioner to the Philippines Sayre, who arrived in Tokyo yesterday, and Arita, the spokesman replied that the Japanese side had not made such preparations because the US Embassy had not made this suggestion. (Reuters, 1st)

Tokyo: The Miyako Shimbun reported that Japan may begin negotiations with various countries to conclude a defense pact to prevent Far Eastern countries from being drawn into the European war. It is reported that the Japanese government intends to make efforts to maintain the status quo of Far Eastern countries that have direct or indirect relations with European powers and to prevent them from being drawn into the war.

Tokyo: The Kokumin Shimbun predicted today that the positive intentions contained in Foreign Minister Arita's statement on April 15 regarding the Dutch East Indies would also apply to British India and French Annam. The newspaper said that Arita's statement indicated that in order to maintain its policy of non-interference in the European war, Japan could not be indifferent to the expansion of the European war to East Asia, nor could it ignore the political and economic changes caused by the belligerent countries in various East Asian countries in the status quo. Britain and France now have a tendency to extend their mobilization plans to various East Asian countries, as evidenced by the arms agreement between India and Vietnam announced on April 29. (Reuters, 1st)

Tokyo: Today, a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, in response to questions from reporters from various newspapers, stated that the reports in the Kokumin and Miyako Shimbun that Foreign Minister Arita's principle of invoking his statements on April 15 regarding the Dutch East Indies, French Vietnam, and British India might be applied to indicate that Japan, even in the midst of the European war, is deeply concerned about maintaining the status quo of the above countries are all unfounded and idealistic. The spokesman also responded to the question of whether the Japanese government was prepared to conclude a non-aggression pact with the Philippines, saying that Foreign Minister Arita had stated in response to questions in the last Diet that the Japanese government was prepared to conclude mutual non-aggression pacts with various countries in the South Seas. Therefore, the Japanese government is prepared to conclude such an agreement with any other country, not just the Philippines. However, no substantive negotiations have yet begun, nor is a multilateral convention under consideration. (Reuters, 1st)

### Ministry of Economic Affairs Issues Circular to Economic Circles Nationwide: Strengthen the Economic Warfare Front

Chongqing: The Ministry of Economic Affairs recently issued a circular to economic circles nationwide to strengthen the economic warfare front. The original text of the circular is as follows: Regarding various enterprises in war zones or near war zones, the Ministry has previously formulated restrictive measures, which have been circulated for compliance. As the Japanese puppets attempt to seize various economic enterprises, they often use the name of returning private property to entice people to cooperate with them. If the organizers of various companies and enterprises are misled by their plans, it will not only harm private rights and interests but also endanger national resources, with far-reaching consequences. The restrictive measures for various enterprises in war zones or near war zones stipulate that any change of name or transfer, mortgage, or alteration of rights and interests for those engaged in fisheries, mining, forestry, and obtaining special business licenses, any transfer or mortgage of real estate, any change of name of shareholders in various companies, any transfer or mortgage of shares, and any contracts or agreements entered into by organizers or representatives of various companies or other enterprises with foreign merchants regarding rights and interests must be submitted to the Ministry for approval, otherwise they will be invalid. It is hoped that the organizers of various enterprises and the shareholders of various companies will strictly abide by the nine measures, adhere to justice, and avoid falling into treacherous schemes and regretting it later. This is of utmost importance. (Telegram, 2nd)

At every important stage of the negotiations on this matter, the British government consulted with the Chinese government and will continue to do so in the future. (Reuters, 2nd)

### German Troops Occupy Donbas, Control Norwegian Railway Trunk Line, Fierce Fighting Continues Around Trondheim, Rumor of Norwegian Army Recapturing Røros

London: The War Office recently announced that the Allied forces have expanded their occupied area in Narvik, and the war is progressing satisfactorily. There have been no changes on the front lines in the southern Sossus region. In the Donbas region, British troops were fiercely attacked by enemy forces and retreated to their predetermined positions after determined resistance. (Reuters, 1st)

Stockholm: A local radio station has just announced that British, French, and Norwegian troops have consolidated their positions around the port of Bergen, and the German troops there are being withdrawn to the Eidsvoll area. (Havas, 2nd)

Paris: Military personnel here have recently discussed the situation of the war in Norway, summarizing it as follows: (1) Fierce fighting has been taking place in the Donbas area since yesterday, and is still ongoing. (2) When German troops advanced towards Storlien, they encountered resolute resistance from Norwegian forces. In addition, a group of volunteers from Scandinavian countries had just returned to Norway from Finland and immediately went to the front lines to assist in blocking the advance. The German troops were therefore hindered and unable to continue advancing. (3) The claims that Røros and Tynset have been recaptured by Norwegian forces have not yet been officially confirmed, but it is certain that Norwegian forces have the upper hand in those areas. (4) The German side is experiencing great difficulty in establishing contact between Oslo and the port of Trondheim. (Havas, 2nd)

Berlin: German troops advancing south from Trondheim have made contact with German troops advancing north from Oslo. This is of great military significance. The German troops stationed in Trondheim no longer depend on air and sea transport and can directly transport military supplies and reinforcements from the Oslo area. (Haitong, 1st)

Berlin: Today's German war report stated that fierce battles have taken place several times between Oslo and Trondheim. British troops have withdrawn from the Åndalsnes area, and countless military supplies and equipment have fallen into the hands of the German army. 300 Norwegian soldiers were captured by the German army 40 kilometers southwest of Åndalsnes. They were covering the retreat for the British army and were unable to escape. All railways between Donbas and Ulvsborg are under German control. German troops advancing eastward from Bergen and German troops advancing westward from Oslo met along the railway line. No particularly important events occurred in Narvik and Trondheim. The German Air Force continues to bomb enemy forces landing in various parts of Norway. British naval forces near Narvik were attacked by German aircraft, and a cruiser was hit by bombs, with heavy smoke and intense flames visible from high altitudes. The sound of explosions was very loud. A British freighter was sunk and six were severely damaged. Several British aircraft were shot down. No special events occurred on the Western Front. (Haitong, 2nd)

Berlin: A German military officer said this morning that a small skirmish occurred last night at Klingen, 50 kilometers northwest of Donbas. More than 300 Norwegian soldiers were captured. Our army advanced northwest from Oslo and has now reached Sognefjord. In the Valdres area, in addition to capturing 290 horses, 3 field guns, and 85 machine guns, we also captured 300 officers and 3,200 soldiers. (Haitong, 2nd)

London: The British War Office recently stated that British troops in Donbas, Norway, are fighting bravely and have stopped the enemy's advance. British troops north of Steinkjer have once again demonstrated their superiority in reconnaissance warfare and inflicted heavy casualties on the enemy. French troops have landed along the Norwegian coast. (Reuters, 1st)

Stockholm: It is reported that the German withdrawal from Røros was due to the disruption of their transportation line at Rena, which is located about 20 miles north of Elverum in southern Norway. It is generally believed that the Norwegian reports of the retreat of German vehicles from the Tysset to Kvikne highway are credible. (Reuters, 2nd)

Stockholm: According to indirect information, the Norwegian army resisting the German advance inland from Bergen has received reinforcements from the Allied forces. In joint operations, they have driven the German army out of Kvamsøy (eastern end of Hardangerfjord). The Norwegian News Agency stated that the Norwegian army attacked Røros from the east at 5:00 AM yesterday and recaptured it. There were some foreign volunteers in the Norwegian army. (Reuters, 2nd)

Stockholm: The Norwegian News Agency here recently stated that German troops withdrew from Røros, an important town south of Trondheim, on Tuesday night, and Norwegian troops immediately entered the town at that time. According to captured German soldiers, the German retreat was due to insufficient supplies. It is reported that German troops are also withdrawing from Tynset, which is 25 miles from Røros. (Reuters, 2nd)

Paris: According to sources in Stockholm, a small number of Norwegian troops who have been defending the Hegra Fortress for more than three weeks have now reportedly made contact with Allied forces. (Reuters, 1st)

Stockholm: According to information obtained here, Allied forces along the railway and south of Donbas are being reinforced. These new forces recently landed at various points between Trondheim and Bergen. There were reports of fighting in Hegra yesterday morning. German mechanized units, after overcoming snow-covered and dangerous roads, rushed to Hegra from the mountains. Another German unit departing from Tynset was blocked by Norwegian forces at Kvikne, 15 miles from the railway. The German command stated that the German troops who had made contact between Støren and Trondheim referred to this army. The German troops on the Steinkjer front, without waiting for the support of reinforcements from the south, suddenly launched a fierce attack on the French and Norwegian positions on both sides of Snåsavatnet, using heavy artillery and aircraft as cover, but were eventually defeated. According to the Norwegian military command, the German army suffered heavy losses in this battle. The reason for their hasty attack without waiting for reinforcements was probably due to the approaching warmer weather. As the climate warms, the river ice melts, the water rises, and the roads are flooded, making it difficult to use mechanized units. (Reuters, 1st)

Berlin: The German High Command issued a war report today stating that German troops operating in Norway continue to advance in all directions. Fighting continued in the Trondheim area yesterday. The number of Norwegian soldiers surrendering in the Lillehammer area is even greater than the previous day. All are officers and soldiers of the Norwegian 2nd Division, including 200 officers and 3,500 soldiers. 7 cannons, 125 machine guns, and 150 intact vehicles were captured. In the mountains near Rommen, between Vågå and Sognefjord, 1,200 Norwegian soldiers surrendered to our army. Our air force again bombed British warships in Namsos, and two bombs sank a British anti-aircraft cruiser. Another cruiser was hit by a bomb and destroyed. A destroyer and five transport ships were also hit and sunk. When British aircraft went to Stavanger for an air raid, eight aircraft were shot down by our anti-aircraft guns and fighter planes. When British aircraft bombed Fornebu Airport near Oslo, one aircraft was shot down by us. (Haitong, 1st)

Berlin: According to the German High Command, German troops pursuing the enemy in Gudbrandsdal have reached Donbas, an important railway and highway center.

German Airfield Attacked Again

London: This morning, a British pilot detailed the night raid on Stavanger Airfield on Tuesday evening, saying, "I witnessed a British aircraft dropping a bomb that hit the runway in the airfield, and I saw another British aircraft drop multiple heavy bombs near the intersection of the runways. Two of the first batch of British aircraft immediately flew away over the sea. Six German Messerschmitt fighters fiercely attacked them." The pilot continued, "When my aircraft flew to about two miles from the coast, two German Messerschmitt fighters flew to attack. The rear gunner in my aircraft immediately concentrated fire on the right side of one of them, and the aircraft caught fire and fell into the sea. The other aircraft, seeing this, fled towards the coast. Soon, another Messerschmitt fighter flew over and engaged my aircraft in combat for thirty minutes. The German aircraft was hit by several bullets and fled with injuries. After I flew back to base, I inspected the fuselage and there were no damages." Another bomber pilot said that he saw a hangar and dropped several bombs on it, with at least two hitting. (Reuters, 2nd)

Hitler Commends His Generals

Berlin: German Führer and Supreme Commander of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, Hitler, issued an order yesterday commending the troops fighting in Norway, stating briefly that the rapid advance of the German army has established land communication between Oslo and Trondheim, and the Allied attempt to prevent the German occupation of Norway has also failed. The close cooperation of the army, navy, and air force has created the highest honor for the German army. To express the gratitude of the German people, the German Führer awarded the Iron Cross to General Falkenhorst, the commander-in-chief of the German army in Norway. Medals will also be awarded to other officers and soldiers who have fought bravely after their commanders report them. (Haitong, 1st)

British Newspapers Comment on the War Situation

London: According to special dispatches published here today, most London newspapers are emphatically stating that the Norwegian war has reached a critical stage. The Times' editorial is titled "The Setback at Trondheim," and the Daily Telegraph says that anyone who studies the news of the Norwegian war will feel that the Allied war effort in that area has clearly been poor in recent days. Those who read the war reports in the newspapers in detail will understand this even more clearly. The Daily Herald asks the authorities to inform the public of the true situation of the war. The News Chronicle says that the British Army, Navy, and Air Force should urgently unify command so that they can achieve cooperation and make decisions quickly. The Times' editorial said that even if the German troops in Oslo and Trondheim have not yet met, it is now certain that it is only a matter of time. The Allied hope of quickly cutting off and annihilating the German troops in Trondheim has vanished, and the Allied forces fighting south of the city are in danger of being attacked from both sides and cut off. The most important task now is to defend a line that prevents German troops from invading the narrow strip of land stretching from the Swedish border to the North Sea and far into the Arctic Circle. The Allied forces must place a strong army and air force behind this line and make their strength sufficient to overcome the advantages initially held by the enemy and enable them to take the offensive against the enemy at an appropriate time and eliminate the enemy from Norwegian territory. At present, the procedure for expelling the invaders must take longer than originally expected when the navy initially won. However, people everywhere do not slacken in their efforts to save Norway from the abyss of suffering. The Daily Telegraph said that the main element of the Allied spiritual strength is that their governments all feel that they must not conceal the truth when the situation turns critical. In the history of various countries, no one is as determined in battle as Britain and France. The Norwegian war situation needs to be dealt with, lest the Allies lack determination. Today's situation is only a change in the second battlefield, and it has not developed as we hoped. The Daily Mail's editorial, based on the speech by Liberal Opposition leader Sinclair in the House of Commons yesterday, urging the government to take active action in the Norwegian war, said that today's decision must be made by the Allied Chiefs of Staff and cannot allow political reputation to influence this decision. (Reuters, 1st)

### British Minesweeper Sunk by Mine

In addition to the many casualties, about 50 houses were destroyed. (Reuters, 2nd)

### US Department of Commerce Releases Report: Japanese Economic Structure is Weak, Efuci Rejects "East Asia Bloc" Theory, Says Japan is Not Yet Economically Self-Sufficient

Washington: The US Department of Commerce released a report on the state of the Japanese economy in 1939, stating that Japan's economic structure is becoming increasingly weakened due to the war in China. Japan's focus on the war in China has had a detrimental impact on various other developments, such as economic instability, increased currency issuance, inflationary trends, lack of goods supply, reduced labor efficiency, and a large increase in national debt. Military production has increased industrial output by 5% compared to 1938, but the continued expansion of general industrial output has been hindered by insufficient supply of electricity and coal, lack of labor, reduced efficiency of machinery, and scarcity of key raw materials. The most satisfactory aspect of the Japanese economy is the improvement in agricultural conditions, such as the increase in the value of rice, wheat, and silk. However, prices have increased the cost of living for workers by 15.3% compared to 1938, while workers' earnings have only increased by 10% compared to 1938. In 1938, Japan's national debt increased by 30%, totaling US$5,595,000,000. In other words, it has more than doubled the debt amount before the war in China, and the debt absorption capacity has weakened, which is a cause for concern, as it is expected that Japan will issue US$1,500,000,000 worth of national debt in 1940. Since the outbreak of the European War, Japan has adopted a plan to crack down on speculation, regulate prices, and inspect shipping, but it is generally believed that Japan cannot enjoy all the benefits of the trade opportunities provided by the European War. (Reuters, 30th)

Tokyo: Efuci, a member of the Japanese House of Peers and former ambassador to the United States, who is known for his close ties to Britain and the United States, recently published an article in "Diplomatic Times" dismissing the theory of Japan, China, and "Manchukuo" forming an "East Asia Bloc" to seek economic self-sufficiency as "a daydream." He stated briefly that after carefully studying the Japanese economic life, it is known that Japan cannot survive economically without maintaining strong relations with foreign countries.

### Philippine Congress Passes New Immigration Law, Limits Entry to 500 People Per Year

Manila: The Philippine Congress today almost unanimously approved a new immigration law that limits the number of foreigners immigrating to the Philippines to 500 per year, passing the bill with 67 votes to 1. This new immigration law will have the greatest impact on Chinese and Japanese immigrants, as China and Japan previously had 2,000 to 3,000 people immigrating each year. However, this passed bill must be signed by President Quezon and approved by President Roosevelt before it can become law. (United Press, 2nd)

### US Funds of Foreigners Prohibited from Transferring, House Passes Bill Authorizing President to Execute

Washington: The US House of Representatives passed a bill last night authorizing the President to restrict or prohibit the transfer of foreign investments in the United States during wartime or other emergencies. This bill was passed by the Senate on Sunday, so the bill is now being sent to the White House for signature. The US President recently took action to prevent Danes and Norwegians from withdrawing their deposits in the United States. This action is legal, but there is no problem with its occurrence, and this bill is designed to address this problem. The Treasury Department has earmarked the deposits of Norwegians and Danes in American banks, but the restriction on transfers will remain in effect. (Reuters, 2nd)

### Mediterranean Situation Tense, British Far East Merchant Ships Change Routes, British Government Instructs All Ships to Detour Around the Cape of Good Hope, and Orders Prohibition of Royal Airplanes Stopping Overnight in Italy

London: According to news from Cairo, Egypt, the Egyptian government has taken precautionary measures due to the unstable situation in the Mediterranean. Shipping companies in Port Said and Suez have received notifications stating that British merchant ships that previously passed through the Suez Canal should now detour around the Atlantic Cape of Good Hope and enter the Indian Ocean. However, the British Naval Headquarters declared that traffic between ports along the Mediterranean coast is not subject to this measure. In addition, British merchant ships currently in the Indian Ocean have been ordered to detour around the Cape of Good Hope to return to their home country. (Havas, 1st)

London: After the British government implemented a precautionary plan in the Mediterranean, ships sailing from Britain to the East and the Far East will likely change their route around the Cape of Good Hope instead of loading large quantities of goods at Mediterranean ports. Even if British ships load goods for Naples, Italy, and Marseille, France, these goods may have to be transshipped by non-British merchant ships. Now the shipping companies of Port Said and the Suez Canal have received notifications that British ships will change their route around the Cape of Good Hope. However, it is heard that this precautionary plan will not cause all British ships to withdraw or change their route. Each ship's journey will be considered separately based on its circumstances, and the special needs of the goods it carries and the political situation at the time of departure must be considered. The British naval authorities in Cairo stated that British shipping within the Mediterranean will not be affected by the government's plans. Four days ago, British ships returning home north of Aden were allowed to enter the Mediterranean. However, since then, British ships in the Red Sea have been notified to detour around the Cape of Good Hope to return to Britain. A Reuters diplomatic correspondent learned from reliable sources that the British government's decision is an indication to Italy that the recent remarks made by Italian newspapers and spokespersons in the political circles are contrary to the spirit of the British-Italian Gentlemen's Agreement. It is particularly unfortunate that Italian newspapers suddenly changed their attitude when British-Italian commercial talks were about to take effect. One of the agreements being negotiated will stipulate that Italy builds ships for Britain in exchange for British coal. (Reuters, 2nd)

Paris: Regarding the British merchant ships stopping navigation in the Mediterranean Sea, well-informed sources here recently stated that the British government's adoption of this measure is to express that no matter what happens in the Mediterranean, Britain and France are prepared for any eventuality. Recently, Italy has adopted various methods to demonstrate anti-British and anti-French sentiment, so this British measure is necessary. Moreover, the Italian authorities allow the German Embassy in Italy to spread rumors that a pro-German figure in Italy, namely Farinacci, the former secretary-general of the Fascist Party, will succeed Ciano as Foreign Minister, and Bismarck, the counselor of the German Embassy in Italy, will succeed Mackensen as the ambassador to Italy. It is also said that the Italian government's appointment of Alfieri as ambassador to Germany yesterday is a prelude to the reorganization of the cabinet, so that pro-German figures can occupy important positions. Although these points are not substantial, Britain and France have to prepare for them in advance, because if Italy and Germany cooperate militarily, an incident is bound to occur in the Mediterranean. (Havas, 1st)

Rome: Imperial Airways of Britain, whose airmail planes fly to various destinations in the Near East and Middle East, has canceled Rome as a stop and will now stop in Athens, Greece, or Marseille, France. (Havas, 1st)

London: Reliable sources say that the measures the British government intends to take in the Mediterranean are purely precautionary. It is heard that the British government very much hopes that these measures are only temporary. The British government is only making these necessary precautions in view of the possible future situation in the Mediterranean. (Reuters, 2nd)

Rome: The British government took further precautionary measures yesterday, ordering Royal Air Force planes not to make their usual overnight stops in Italy. This order was issued following this week's order to British ships to stop sailing through the Mediterranean. It is widely believed that this order is the result of Italy's recent Jaron's implication that Italy might join Germany in the war. London's order prohibiting Royal Air Force planes from stopping in Italy was issued hours after British Chargé d'Affaires Sir Charles held talks with Italian Foreign Minister Ciano. (United Press, 2nd)

Rome: The Italian authorities seem to have decided to punish those who publicly sympathize with Britain and France. For example, a certain member of the Fascist Party was recently referred to disciplinary action by the party cadres for giving a speech praising Britain and France. Another journalist who had written articles criticizing Germany is currently being investigated by government authorities for punishment. (Havas, 30th)

London: There are rumors that Germany has concentrated a large army on the border of Yugoslavia, and Italy has also concentrated troops on the border between Albania and Yugoslavia. Reliable sources from the capital of Yugoslavia have denied this. As far as the responsible persons in that country know, the German army stationed in Klagenfurt, Austria, is only four divisions, with 300 to 400 aircraft. As for the Albanian border, the Yugoslav authorities have taken normal defensive measures due to the geographical situation. In addition, although the Yugoslav government has recruited reservists to enlist, officials and residents in general are able to remain calm. (Havas, 1st)

### Italy Temporarily Will Not Abandon Non-Belligerent Status; Not a Combatant Nation; Mussolini Meets with US Ambassador; Near East Treaty Nations to Hold Meeting

Rome Mussolini met yesterday with US Ambassador Phillips. It is reported that the US Ambassador visited Mussolini due to the international situation. What they discussed is still unknown. However, according to US sources, this meeting gives the impression that Italy will not change its non-belligerent stance in the coming days. The British Chargé d'Affaires in Italy, Charles, met with Italian Foreign Minister Ciano for a long time yesterday. It is said that the conversation was quite harmonious. British figures in Rome believe that the decision of British ships not to travel through the Mediterranean does not reflect a change in the relationship between Britain and Italy or issues of common interest. Although the full meaning of this British decision is not fully understood by the Italians, they will certainly deeply understand the seriousness of the situation because of it. (Reuters, 2nd)

Washington The State Department recently stated that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has provided assurances to US Ambassador to Italy Phillips that Italy does not intend to abandon its non-belligerent status temporarily. There are no more than two reasons for this: one is that Britain decided to order all merchant ships to cease sailing in the Mediterranean, and the other is that Italy is not yet prepared, economically, militarily, and psychologically, to immediately assist Germany in the war. However, according to the US military and political circles, Prime Minister Mussolini still has the possibility of weighing his own national interests and changing his attitude at any time. If Italy decides to assist Germany in the war, its people, although generally unwilling to be enemies with Britain and France, will follow Prime Minister Mussolini's lead. Diplomatic circles say that at this time, Germany is exerting great pressure to request Italy, and strongly emphasizes the situation of the Norway-Czech war, which has proved that the German air force's power is above the British and French navies. Italy does not seem to be completely persuaded by this, and will continue to maintain an ambiguous attitude as far as it can, but is willing to support Germany for various indications that prove the Germany-Italy axis is solid and unbreakable.

London Members of Parliament and those close to the British government here are pessimistic about the situation in the Mediterranean. They say that although it is rumored that Prime Minister Mussolini has provided assurances to the US Ambassador to Italy Phillips, no reliable news has been received from Rome to confirm this. Although Italy's attitude is still hesitant at this time, or even intends to "hesitate and retreat" because of Britain's warning (referring to the British merchant ships ceasing sailing in the Mediterranean), Italy's policy has already entered a path from which it is difficult to turn back. This is the view generally held by British authorities. Therefore, the government has already conducted talks with the Turkish government to deal with Italy's intervention in the Balkan Peninsula.

### Papal Mediation; British-Italian Relations; Based on Four Key Points

Vatican Authoritative circles learned this morning that the Pope is preparing to seek understanding and cooperation between Italy and Britain, based on the following four key points proposed by Italy. It is said that the meeting between British Foreign Secretary Halifax and Italian Ambassador to London Bastiani last Friday was planned by the Pope. Sources in the Vatican said that if Italy can protect its satisfied demands, it will be willing to reopen friendship negotiations with Britain. The four key points are: (1) Italy's position in the Mediterranean should be changed; (2) Britain should guarantee Italy's interests in the Balkans, without being undermined by British economic pressure there; (3) Britain should recognize the alliance between Italy and Germany. If Britain attempts to subvert the Nazi regime in Germany or dismember Germany, Italy will not "sit idly by"; (4) Italy's future maritime trade will not be obstructed by the British blockade.

### Beauty Secrets (1)

Nowadays, there are fewer women who can be called "old" than before. Fifteen years ago, judging from a woman's appearance, 38 years old could be regarded as the end of youth and the beginning of middle age. But what about now? The transition period for women from youth to old age has almost been extended by ten years. Nowadays, women generally do not show signs of aging until they are 48 years old. In other words, take the current 18-year-old new movie star, Boni, for example, her youthful appearance can last for another 30 years. What about before? It was only 20 years. The "youth" of 30 years mentioned here for Ms. Boni refers to her private life. If it refers to her appearance in the films, with the modern various wonderful makeup techniques, lighting, and photography techniques, her youth can be maintained longer than in her private life. In terms of private life, not only Ms. Boni, but any charming 18-year-old girl can have 30 years of youth - ladies, if you want a beautiful appearance, please use Da Xi face powder; if you want white teeth, please use Da Xi toothpaste.

### May Day Labor Day; Moscow Grand Parade; Military Parade Held in Red Square; Voroshilov Delivers Speech

Moscow On May Day Labor Day, an unprecedentedly grand parade and review was held here. The review ceremony began at noon in Red Square. Stalin, Molotov, Kaganovich, Kalinin, Andreyev, Mikoyan, Shvernik, Beria, and members of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, chairmen of various People's Committees, all ascended the podium of Lenin's Mausoleum. As for the representatives of the Moscow Soviet, Red Army and Navy commanders, Soviet heroes, diplomatic corps personnel, and foreign journalists, they were seated on another platform. The reviewed troops were commanded by Soviet Marshal Budyonny, and the People's Commissar of Defense Voroshilov stood in front of the troops and delivered a speech, saying,

"Currently, only the Soviet people can celebrate this Labor Day with enthusiasm. The Soviet people are proud of the achievements of Soviet socialism. At the same time, they are particularly satisfied that they have not been involved in the Second Imperialist War."

"To this day, the people of capitalist countries must more deeply recognize the difference between capitalist and Soviet countries. Under the leadership of Lenin, Stalin's party, and the great Stalin, 183 million Soviet people are working hard to build their socialist life. The Soviet Union does not want to join the war, but is ready to fight at any time."

The defeat of the Finnish Defense Forces and the destruction of the Mannerheim Line have proven the strength of our people and the glory and bravery of the Red Army.

"The current international situation is extremely complicated. The Second Imperialist War has gradually expanded. Agitators are now trying to drag us into this bloody massacre, and even attack our territory when the opportunity arises. Therefore, we must be ready to deal with everything at any time. We must redouble our efforts to strengthen the defense of our motherland and consolidate the strength of the Red Army and Navy. We must complete this task in the spirit of Bolshevism, and the completion of this task is guaranteed by the will of our 183 million people and the wise Lenin-Stalin Party."

The troops were praised by the guests for their neat steps during the review. At the same time, the Red Army and Navy commanders also passed the review platform to pay tribute to Stalin and his comrades. Behind these commanders were students and instructors from military academies.

The most noteworthy thing was the infantry's procession. Their neat steps and majestic spirit received unanimous praise. At this time, armed members of the laboring masses entered the field. They were textile workers, railway employees, scientists, and artists, carrying long guns and full of spirit, indicating that they were ready to rise up and defend their motherland at any time.

More than 600 aircraft perform new tactics

After the infantry were cavalry, machine gun teams, artillery teams, and motorcycle teams. After that, the air defense forces also held a demonstration, showing the thoroughness of the Soviet Union's air defense. The Red Army's new weapons were also shown during the review. The various artillery pieces showed great power when they passed by. The orchestra, with more than 1,000 people, had a majestic and moving tone. Tank and armored vehicle teams galloped through Red Square, attracting attention. There were as many tanks as carp crossing the river. The large Red Square could hardly accommodate them. Three aircraft performed in the sky at this time, with novel postures never seen before. At the same time, various aircraft, in teams of nine, performed in the sky over Moscow. The fighters and bombers that were performed at that time were very new, and they were as fast as thunder during the performance, and the audience was overwhelmed. A total of 634 aircraft participated in the performance. (TASS, 1st)

Moscow After the Red Army was reviewed in Red Square on Labor Day, the laboring masses entered the field one after another, holding slogans and flags, and held a grand parade. First were the factories and cultural figures, followed by athletes. They all paid tribute to Stalin and his comrades, and cheered for their leaders, with voices shaking the sky. In the slogans and slogans, they expressed their respect for the heroic Red Army and were ready to deal with everything. Slogans were everywhere, fully supporting the Soviet Union's neutral policy.

The parade of the laboring masses lasted for four hours, showing the political unity of the Soviet people and their support for the party and Stalin. (TASS, 1st)

Soviet Defense Commissar Issues Proclamation on May Day

Moscow Soviet Defense Commissar Voroshilov issued a proclamation today for Labor Day, saying,

"Today, our people celebrate May 1st, which is a memorial to review the achievements of our laboring masses. This year, the Soviet Union should celebrate this memorial day in a solemn manner, because in addition to the great achievements in socialist culture and peaceful work, the Soviet Red Army has also added glorious victories to the motherland."

Although Britain and France attempted to drag us into the European war, thanks to the wise policies of the government and the party under Stalin's leadership, our country was fortunate not to be affected. The war waged by the British and French groups against Germany has now tended to expand, and new countries have been involved in the war. At the same time, in the Far East, the war is also continuing. Regarding our country's foreign policy, it has been explained by our head of state Molotov in the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, and has been approved by the Supreme Soviet. This Bolshevik foreign policy is very clear. Its main purpose is to guarantee the peace of all countries and the security of our country. This policy is guaranteed by our country's treaties with various countries, and is also supported by our 183,000,000 people and armed comrades. Last autumn, the Finnish government became a plaything of "powerful" protectors. Not only did it fail to sign a friendship treaty with our country, but it also waged war against us.

The Soviet government immediately took steps to protect Leningrad and our northwestern border. As a result, the Finnish Defense Forces have been fatally struck by the Leningrad Military District troops, and the so-called Mannerheim Line has also been destroyed. The Mannerheim Line was built by imperialist experts, engineers, and staff, and was a military base for preparing to attack the Soviet Union.

The Mannerheim Line and the Maginot and Siegfried Lines are the same. The line is built with hundreds of strong bunkers, machine guns, artillery, tunnels, landmine traps, tank vehicle nets, and various other obstacles. War instigators believed that the line was an impregnable fortress, and that any army would be defeated, but under the serious blow of the Leningrad District troops, it was eventually shattered. Stalin once said that as far as the Bolshevik Party is concerned, there is no impregnable fortress in the world, and this statement has now been proven.

In this war, Soviet Red Army officers and political personnel have not only fully demonstrated the morale of the Red Army and the greatness of Soviet military equipment, but have also proven that the Red Army can make good use of its weapons in any environment. In addition, in addition to defeating the Finnish army, the Red Army has also defeated the imperialist armed forces that attempted to turn the Finnish war into a world war. The war in recent days has given the Red Army new experience in war. We should study this new experience, correct our shortcomings, and continue to enhance our strengths. Bolsheviks do not have the habit of sticking to the old ways. We should not feel complacent about our victories. The times are progressing, therefore, the Red Army must continue to enhance its strength, and should strive for perfection in terms of military knowledge.

Imperialist war instigators must still threaten our country with war, therefore, we should be prepared at any time and improve our combat power to repel any enemy that attacks our motherland. Also, Soviet Navy Commander Kuznetsov issued a proclamation, pointing out the political significance of Labor Day and the achievements of the Soviet Union in recent years. The text reads, "The Soviet Baltic and Northern Fleets have completed their tasks at the same time as the Red Army, defeating the Finnish Defense Forces, and the government has commended the naval achievements." (TASS, 1st)

### Foreign Minister Wang Broadcasts Speech

Chongqing Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui delivered a broadcast speech on the International Shortwave Radio Station at 12:20 today. The topic of his speech was "Defending Culture." The gist of his speech was that the "government" in Nanjing cannot succeed, because the Chinese people have already deeply understood its true meaning and know that this government is controlled by the Japanese. The purpose of the Japanese invasion of China is not only to enslave the 450 million Chinese people, but also to eliminate Chinese culture and replace it with Japanese militarism. However, this policy will inevitably fail. No matter what the Japanese do, our final victory cannot be shaken. Any action by the Japanese, even if it is decorated with a Chinese-style appearance, will eventually fail, because the Chinese masses have deeply understood the Japanese intentions and have resolutely engaged in saving the country with their manpower and financial resources. Even women at the front line do not hesitate to volunteer to undertake the work of destroying roads and building defenses. Today is Labor Day, and the world's workers should celebrate it in an atmosphere of peace. But now we cannot talk about this, because the masses of people are currently suffering from the pain of war. Peace is indivisible, and this is a natural principle. Unless Japan's invasion of China is stopped, there will never be hope for peace in the world. China's resistance is not only defending China's own independence and its own culture, but also greatly helping the restoration of world peace and order. (United Press, 1st)

### The Situation in Macau is Very Tense

Hong Kong The situation in Macau is very tense. Although the Portuguese and Japanese authorities have repeatedly denied it, it has been confirmed by visitors from Macau. Last week, two Macau Indian policemen were shot dead by soldiers holding Japanese flags on Lapa Island. Another Indian policeman and a Portuguese policeman from Shanghai were injured. Last Sunday, a motor ship loaded with armed Japanese soldiers landed on the coast of Macau, causing great panic among the residents. The Japanese soldiers went directly to the business center of Macau to enter large hotels to gamble on fan-tan. Nearby Chinese merchants, banks, and shops immediately closed their doors. The Portuguese military police authorities rushed to send armed military police to guard important locations until the Japanese soldiers left in the evening. Although no accidents occurred, it has left a very bad impression on the residents. It is heard that many wealthy Chinese in Macau intend to move to Hong Kong, so the demand for Hong Kong dollars is extremely high, resulting in a sharp drop in Chinese currency. (Reuters, 1st)

### Overview of Adult Education Implementation in Guizhou Province (5)

(7) Implementation Situation

(1) Establishment of Adult Classes: According to the results of a renewed survey, there are 2,798,875 adults in the province who should be enrolled in school. According to the prescribed number of people per class, 63,395 adult classes must be set up throughout the province. In addition to setting up adult classes in basic schools at all levels, secondary schools and above, and other cultural and industrial organizations, each county also sets up at least two demonstration adult classes in specially designated secondary schools or central basic schools with excellent performance, as a demonstration for general adult classes.

As for the establishment of adult classes for special ethnic groups in various counties, it is handled in accordance with the "Provisional Measures for Adult Education for Ethnic Groups in Guangxi Province." It is jointly handled by teachers of national basic schools in the villages and streets where they are located, and one class is conducted per period until it is completed.

(2) Phased Implementation: The implementation of adult education is limited by teachers and textbooks, and for the convenience of supervision, the adult classes in the province are generally divided into four phases. However, the environment in each county is very different, and those that are divided into districts and phases each month are handled separately. Generally speaking, each county can complete the process as scheduled according to the predetermined progress. The number of adult classes and students in each phase in the province is as follows: (Phase 1) 662,217 people enrolled, 18,172 classes, 9,086 teachers, 531,383 graduates, started on March 16th and ended on May 15th; (Phase 2) 657,665 people enrolled, 18,165 classes, 9,083 teachers, 520,14 people graduated, started on June and ended on July 31st; (Phase 3) 632,863 people enrolled, 17,196 classes, 8,598 teachers, started on August 16th and ended on October 15th; (Phase 4) 522,435 people enrolled, 14,401 classes, 7,201 teachers, started on November 1st and ended on December 21st. The total number of enrollments above is 2,474,180, 67,934 classes, and 10,550 teachers, starting from March 16th and ending on December 30th. (Note: (1) The total number of teachers refers to the total number of teachers transferred from various counties and who have received short-term training. (2) The number of graduates in the 2nd and 4th phases is temporarily missing because the war in southern Guangxi affected the reporting of various counties.

(3) Work Review: In order to provide practical problems with the experience of adult education workers, and to increase educational efficiency with the purpose of brainstorming ideas, the "Measures for Phased Discussion Meeting of Various Adult Education Programs" are formulated, stipulating that each county shall convene local adult class teachers and county adult education supervisors within one week after the end of each adult class session to hold discussion meetings. Adult class teachers must submit work reports before the meeting as a reference for studying problems. The discussion matters include the equipment of adult classes, student enrollment and organization, curriculum, teaching materials, teaching, training, continuing education, and adult education for special ethnic groups, and the work of the next adult class is planned. Adult education in each county has made much progress after each review meeting. The problems of the first and second phases of adult classes are rarely present in the third and fourth phases, and the results of the third and fourth phases are far better than the first and second phases. The effectiveness of the review meeting can be seen in general.

In the second and third groups, there were continuous miracles, especially the chop player Zhang Ying was embarrassed by the new player Chuan Qifang. Chuan even won Zhang in a straight set. Zhang Ying is a master of chop shots, and he recently won the individual championship of the two New Six Cups and was also the individual runner-up of the Continental Cup last year. This time is Zhang's worst defeat in three years. In the battle between Deng Xiurong and Huang Zhijun, Deng's skills were better than Huang's. However, Deng was unable to show his unique skills in the competition, and Huang also won in two straight sets. The third round of matches will be held from 7:00 PM tonight at the original location.

Results the night before: Ouyang Wei defeated Pan Rixi 3-1, Chuan Qifang defeated Zhang Ying 3-0, Huang Zhijun defeated Deng Xiurong 3-0, Lu Hanjun defeated Guo Jingren 3-0.

### Foreign Exchange Fluctuations Drastically Yesterday, Government Decides to Stabilize Currency, Stabilization Fund to Be Significantly Increased, US Loan to China Highly Likely, Japanese Conspiracy Fails, Speculators Also Profitless

When Dr. Monroe, a leader of the American business community in Shanghai, visited Shanghai on the 26th and 27th, he reviewed China's financial problems. Fearing that American businesses would be excluded from trade with China in North China, he was deeply concerned that the Japanese would imitate the measures implemented in Tianjin in Shanghai and use the worthless paper of the pseudo "Central Bank" as a tool to attack the legal tender. On the 30th of last month, he sent a telegram to Secretary of State Hull, suggesting that a huge loan be given to China to stabilize China's currency system and consolidate China's finances. This would not only protect American trade with China, but also boost the morale of the Chinese people and strengthen China's position. Dr. Monroe is preparing to lobby after returning to the United States to make it happen. This news spread, and there were rumors that Britain would no longer maintain the stabilization fund, and that the value of Chinese currency would fall in the future, so the United States would come out to maintain it. Until yesterday, the Shanghai foreign exchange market experienced drastic changes and the situation was extremely chaotic. It cannot be said that this drastic change was caused by the above-mentioned proposal, but the turmoil happened at this time, which should be the most important issue for Chinese and foreign people. The information obtained from yesterday's investigation is recorded below:

### Stabilization Committee Continues to Maintain

Yesterday afternoon, the leaders of the banking community in this city received a private telegram from Hong Kong. According to people close to the financial authorities, the Central Government has always maintained the exchange rate of legal tender in Shanghai through the Stabilization Fund Committee. The two previous contractions of the foreign exchange black market were to combat Japanese conspiracies and crack down on speculative activities. Now the Central Government has decided to increase the foreign exchange stabilization fund, and it is expected that the foreign exchange market in Shanghai will stabilize. The black market exchange rate of legal tender has been very stable for several months, and recently there has been a loosening trend. It is heard that the Central Government intends to increase the Shanghai Fund by 5 million pounds in British currency and 7.8 million US dollars. If this news is true, then this suspension of supply is purely to crush the positions of speculators, and foreign exchange can be gradually released, while those who blindly speculate will only suffer the consequences.

### United States Will Never Stand Idly By

According to an economic expert yesterday, the center of gravity of American interests in China is in Shanghai. Whether it is investment or trade, almost all of it is concentrated in Shanghai. Since Japan has controlled trade in North China, American businesses have no room for development in Tianjin. Shanghai is the main market for American goods. At present, sales of American goods in Shanghai account for 75% of American exports to China, and exports from Shanghai to the United States also account for more than 80% of the country's goods shipped to the United States. Unless the United States is willing to withdraw from the Chinese market, it will never allow the Japanese to manipulate it. The reason why the Japanese have been hesitant to destroy the legal tender and abuse control is that they know there are concerns.

### Financial Market Yesterday Morning, Suddenly Unprecedented Chaos

Crazy Rise Within Two Hours

The English-language Greater America Evening News said that the exchange rate of legal tender fell sharply this morning (2nd). Yesterday (1st), the average exchange rate of legal tender against the US dollar was 16.5 yuan, but this morning it rose to 20.75 yuan within two hours. It only recovered slightly an hour before noon. The closing price at noon was 20 yuan in legal tender, equivalent to one US dollar. When the market opened this morning, the exchange rate between Shanghai and New York was 5.9625 yuan. There were only buyers and no sellers. Then the news that HSBC and Markali refused to sell foreign exchange spread throughout the city. Obviously, the Sino-British Stabilization Fund had stopped interfering in the Shanghai black market. Buyers' bids became higher and higher, causing the US exchange rate to shrink to 4.9375 yuan for spot goods and 4.6875 yuan for May futures. Some sellers then dumped their goods, but it is not known whether their dumping was due to the resumption of work by the Stabilization Fund. The buying trend in the market is still strong, but it is more cautious. By noon, the New York exchange rate had eased slightly, and the closing price was 5.125 yuan for spot goods and 5 yuan for May futures. The future of the market in the afternoon is unpredictable. As the US exchange rate has shrunk unprecedentedly, the British exchange rate has also shrunk to 3.5 pence, which is the lowest record in August last year.

Yen Exchange Rate Also Fell Simultaneously

The banking community in this city was strongly impressed by the fall in the exchange rate of the Japanese yen against the legal tender. At noon, 100 Japanese yen could still be purchased for 125 yuan in legal tender. 100 yuan of Japanese military currency only required 124 yuan of legal tender to be purchased. Therefore, the yen exchange rate in this city is "only slightly more than one-quarter of the official exchange rate in Tokyo." The development of the foreign exchange market this morning immediately had a strong impact on other markets. The Stabilization Fund or its representative bank did not explain the reason for suddenly withdrawing support from the foreign exchange market, causing various rumors to arise, and reliable information could not be obtained. The saying that the United States is about to assist the legal tender has not been confirmed, but it is generally believed that the United States will take measures, at least to assist, the legal tender traded within "Free China."

Gold Price Reaches Unprecedented Peak

Cash was also greatly affected yesterday, creating a crazy surge. The market opened yesterday morning with an astonishing phenomenon, rising to 6,800 yuan, a sudden jump of 1,072 yuan compared to the closing price of 5,728 yuan the day before. However, it soon fell sharply by 800 yuan, followed by a flying rise to an unprecedented peak of 7,000 yuan. Afterwards, it fell again to 6,300 yuan, and when the market closed at noon, it fell back to 6,260 yuan. Decorative gold was only 100 yuan higher, at 650 yuan.

### Serious Situation Created, Various Rumors from Outside, Financial Community Says Two Major Reasons

Yesterday, the black market situation in this city's financial sector was extremely tense. The financial community believes that the creation of this phenomenon is based on two important reasons: (1) Because HSBC and Markali banks stopped supplying foreign exchange for a time to prevent the Japanese from engaging in large-scale arbitrage, there were doubts about the Stabilization Fund. (2) In view of the sharp increase in Shanghai Customs' trade deficit in the past few months, according to investigations, the national trade deficit in the first quarter of this year was 900 million yuan calculated at the black market exchange rate, and 250 million yuan in Shanghai alone, which led to a sharp increase in the demand for foreign exchange in Shanghai. (The saying that there is a trade surplus is calculated based on the legal exchange rate and does not have accurate figures).

External Speculation Absolutely Unreliable

In the market yesterday morning, there was another rumor that the reason why the black exchange rate had undergone drastic changes and suddenly tightened was that it was rumored that the pseudo "Central Bank" was about to be established. However, according to reliable sources yesterday, this news is extremely difficult to confirm, and the authoritative side also stated that even so, its impact on the exchange market would not be so great. The reason why the exchange market suddenly tightened was mostly due to the sharp increase in this city's trade deficit. According to the banking community, the need for foreign exchange in this city has suddenly increased in the past few months, and the reason for this increase is nothing more than the sharp increase in the quantity of imported goods in this city. The sharp increase in the quantity of imported goods is enough to make Chinese and foreign merchants in this city buy and pay for the goods no matter how high the exchange rate rises.

Japanese Buying Large Amounts of Foreign Exchange

In addition, the banking community also stated that in addition to the increased demand for foreign exchange in this city, the amount of foreign exchange that the Japanese have purchased with legal tender in the past few months is also quite alarming. In the past, the Japanese used customs revenue as a source of arbitrage for foreign exchange. According to estimates by the general public, the Japanese exchanged tens of millions of yuan of legal tender for foreign exchange in the past four months. This may be another reason for the sudden tightening of the exchange market.

New York British Exchange Rate Also Fell

Reuters, New York, 1st. Due to the uncertainty of the Norwegian situation and Britain's decision to reroute cargo ships around the Cape of Good Hope, the New York British exchange rate fell successively this morning. The pound opened at 3.485 yuan and recovered slightly at 3.49625 yuan at the close. Yesterday's closing price was 3.50875 yuan. The French franc opened at 1.98375 yuan and closed at 1.98125 yuan. Yesterday's closing price was 1.99 yuan. Foreign public bonds were sold quite actively, and the price of Italian public bonds fell due to the increased tension between Britain and Italy.

### International Relief Society Ends Operations, Reception Center Closed, Donations No Longer Accepted

The Shanghai International Relief Society issued a public notice to all sectors yesterday, stating that the society's work of providing relief to refugees will soon be three years old. A total of six large-scale reception centers, two refugee hospitals, one street children's education center, and one refugee children's middle school have been established successively, accommodating a total of more than 100,000 people. Fortunately, people from all walks of life have been compassionate and have provided continuous assistance. The Standing Committee of the Society has previously decided to close the affiliated reception centers on April 30. All refugees, except for the elderly, weak, disabled, and those who have no one to rely on, will be resettled separately, and the rest will be given generous severance pay. The severance procedures have been completed, and from May 1, the Society will no longer accept donations from all sectors. It is also scheduled that on June 1, the Society's head office will move to the Huayang Yizhen Society on the fourth floor of No. 97 Renji Road to handle the closing, compile an annual report, and distribute it to all sectors for credibility. This is to inform you and express our gratitude.

### The Stability of the Legal Tender and the Abundance of the Stabilization Fund

The Determination to Maintain the Currency System Was Already in Place

The Chinese government has always held the greatest determination to maintain the stability of the currency system and foreign exchange. Now, more than two years into the war of resistance, the legal foreign exchange rate remains as before, namely one shilling, two and a half pence for the British pound and thirty yuan for the U.S. dollar. The government still provides as much as possible for the legitimate needs of various industries. As for the black market exchange rate in Shanghai, the Exchange Stabilization Fund Association also provides appropriate maintenance, and does not stop supply due to the manipulation of speculators. This situation has been proven by facts for some time. The fund itself is still substantial, and the claim that it has been used up is purely unfounded.

Lower Exchange Rates Benefit Exports

According to general observations, the sudden tightening of the black market exchange rate seems to be closely related to the future of the legal tender. It is believed that the future of the legal tender can be determined by the drastic changes in the black market exchange rate. The most significant reason for the sudden tightening of the black market exchange rate is the rumor that problems have occurred with the Exchange Stabilization Fund. The so-called Stabilization Fund is intended to facilitate foreign trade, but in the end it has led some people to profit from it, resulting in the current chaotic and bad situation. According to authoritative sources, it is believed that the value of Chinese currency is currently developing along natural lines. If we take this as an observation point, it is closely related to foreign trade. Considering the sharp increase in imports over the past few months, the trend created by this, when calculated nationwide, has become a phenomenon of continuous increase. Therefore, the decline in the value of Chinese currency seems difficult to prevent by human effort, but it is not entirely unfavorable to China's overall foreign trade, because the fall in the exchange rate can reduce imports of foreign goods and increase exports of domestic goods, and the two may still tend towards equilibrium in the future.

The Stabilization Fund Remains Abundant

In addition, we must also pay attention to the fact that the policy of the so-called Stabilization Fund is not to prescribe a fixed exchange rate for the Chinese legal tender, so as to avoid excessive expenditure of the Stabilization Fund. However, if we think that the Stabilization Fund provided by the two major British banks has a fixed amount, then this judgment is actually a misunderstanding. This can be proven by the recent analysis report of the two banks, because the two banks can also obtain profits from selling and buying in the foreign exchange market. Therefore, we can assert that the Stabilization Fund will not only not be exhausted, but the two banks can continue to find ways to maintain or expand its amount.

Speculators Will Find It Difficult to Profit

The foreign exchange transactions in April have already been settled. It is reported that speculators have entered into between seven and eight million U.S. dollars in May futures. Judging from the current operation of the Stabilization Fund, the long side has no profit to make at present, and the same will be true in the future. Most of the U.S. dollars entered were purchased when the exchange rate was low, and in the future they will have to grit their teeth and sell them off, or be willing to pay a fee to exchange them for June futures, hoping that the environment will be favorable at that time. These speculators believe that the exchange market will only shrink and not rise, so the news of the increase in the Stabilization Fund has destroyed their hopes.

### Today's May Third Memorial: Citizens are Encouraged to Strive, Strengthen their Belief in Resistance and Nation-Building, Unite as One, and Practice Spiritual Mobilization, Saving and Disaster Relief Through Thrift

Today is the 12th anniversary of the Jinan Massacre and the martyrdom of Cai Gongshi. All sectors of the city, due to the special circumstances and in accordance with the central government's regulations, will not engage in extravagant activities, but will commemorate this painful massacre spiritually. In order to support the resistance and build the nation, they will practice spiritual mobilization, saving and disaster relief through thrift. Because on the "May 1st" Labor Day, a large number of leaflets supporting resistance and nation-building and patriotism were found in the Hongkou, Zhabei, and Nanshi districts, the Japanese sent a large number of artillery vehicles and armored vehicles to patrol the areas separately from 10:00 a.m. yesterday. Japanese and puppet police have been added to the bridges in Hongkou District and the iron gates in Nanshi District, and they have conducted extensive searches of pedestrians and vehicles. Therefore, in recent days, there have been very few people traveling to and from these areas.

A Letter from the Shanghai Municipal Party Department to Citizens

The Shanghai Special Municipal Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang issued a letter to the citizens regarding the "May 3rd" Massacre, saying: Time flies, and May 3rd has arrived again. Twelve years ago, around this day, the Japanese warlords, in order to prevent the Northern Expedition of the Revolutionary Army, launched a massacre in Jinan. The invaders painstakingly planned to swallow China in one gulp. From the Sino-Japanese War to the present, they have not hesitated to create a series of bloody debts, also wanting to swallow China. "If China does not perish, aggression will not stop." This sentence speaks to the hearts of the Japanese warlords, and also explains the causes of their launching various massacres and incidents. In the past two years and ten months, for the freedom and liberation of the nation, for the survival of the motherland, for not wanting to be the descendants of a conquered nation, and for liquidating the long-unpaid blood debts of the Japanese, under the leadership of President Chiang, we have launched an unprecedented all-out war of resistance. Today, the war of resistance has tied down the Japanese, and their fighting spirit has declined. Panic and war-weariness are everywhere in the country. These are precisely symbols of the invaders shooting themselves in the foot and embarking on a dead end. Because the invaders have no way to end the war militarily, with the end of the war far off, they use puppet organizations to divide the forces of resistance. This is their last card, which they have always regarded as a rare commodity. Little do they know that they have bought fake medicine in the gourd, and hoping that it will work is simply wishful thinking. Dear citizens, the Japanese war of aggression is on the eve of collapse, and its last card has also appeared. At the same time, the all-out war of resistance under the leadership of President Chiang, after two years and ten months of tempering, has revealed the glimmer of victory. The facts tell us that the last five minutes of struggle are the key to determining the overall situation. From now on, we must strengthen unity and strengthen resistance and nation-building in order to strive for the freedom and liberation of the nation and the country. Only by strengthening unity and strengthening resistance and nation-building can we crush aggression and liquidate decades of blood debts.

### The Chinese Army on the Qinghu Road Achieved Significant Victory. Most of the Japanese Troops in the Yangtze River Estuary Were Transferred to the Front Lines. It is Reported that the Japanese Troops Stationed in Zhudi Have Withdrawn

The English-language "Great American Evening Post" reported that, according to reliable sources, the Japanese army suffered heavy casualties in its brutal anti-guerrilla warfare in western Shanghai. The guerrillas, because the Japanese army massacred villagers and burned villages, bravely came forward to retaliate. With the help of the peasants, they counterattacked the Japanese army in various places. Their actions were swift and flexible, and it is said that they have achieved significant victories. On Sunday and Monday, a team of Japanese troops was cut off by guerrillas in the Songzhu area of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway and suffered a heavy blow. The Japanese army urgently dispatched a large increase in troops, resulting in the area being filled with Japanese troops in some places. In recent months, the number of Japanese troops stationed in most towns along the Yangtze River has been greatly reduced, because most of them have been sent to the front lines for reinforcement, and have been transferred to the "Peace and National Salvation Army" to show non-assistance. Since the outbreak of large-scale guerrilla warfare, the Japanese army in central China has been exhausted and feels a great lack of manpower. Although the Japanese army has destroyed villages and towns on a large scale in an attempt to eliminate the base areas of the guerrillas, the guerrillas continue to operate. On Tuesday evening, the Japanese side sent several ambulances to the North Station to pick up the wounded Japanese soldiers from the guerrilla area.

Withdrawal of Japanese Troops

On the 26th of last month, about 1,000 Japanese troops went to the towns of Zhudi, Panlong, Jiwangmiao, and Guanyintang in western Shanghai and were stationed separately in these places. It is now reported that yesterday (the 1st), about 200 Japanese troops stationed in Zhudi forcibly gathered all the residents of the town in one place. Those who were afraid and avoided were beaten. After the Japanese puppet leaders gave "comforting speeches" to the gathered residents, the Japanese troops immediately withdrew to Shanghai. It is said that the Japanese troops stationed in other towns will also withdraw in the near future.

On-Site Inspection

The "Continental News" reported that Qingpu District, five miles west of Shanghai, has recently been poisoned by the Japanese army. On Sunday, five British and American journalists from this city went to the area to investigate and witnessed twelve villages burned to the ground and injured and killed villagers. The heart-wrenching scenes and photos of the burned villages have all been published in the "Continental News". The spokesperson of the Japanese Army in this city yesterday (the 1st) denied burning more than one village and killing women and children.

Covering Up the Facts

It is said that Qingpu District is a nest of Communist guerrillas, and the anti-Japanese sentiment is extremely strong. Moreover, guerrillas disguised as villagers killed several Japanese soldiers. A team of Japanese troops began military operations against the guerrillas on April 14, with the aim of completely eliminating the Communist elements. The Japanese army conducted household searches and found many Communist elements disguised as farmers, and seized a large number of military weapons and ammunition. The Japanese army acted with extreme caution, so the claim in the anti-Japanese newspapers that civilians, including women and children, were killed is not true. There was only one village that caught fire, and the guerrillas who killed the Japanese soldiers had their headquarters in the village.

Raising Funds for Burial

Now there are seventeen people, including Zhang Jinxiang, who have launched a campaign to raise funds to bury the exposed corpses. The notice says: What is more heartbreaking in the world than dying without a burial place and exposing bones in the wilderness? Those who suffer may be unaware in the underworld, but how can those who see it not feel pain in their hearts? This time, the northern countryside of Sijing Town suffered a tragic massacre by a certain army, which has been recorded in various newspapers. Innocent farmers have suffered this great calamity, corpses are everywhere, and the stench is overwhelming. Is there no danger of causing an epidemic? Jinxiang and others, in view of this, will rush to collect and bury the corpses everywhere as soon as possible, but the cost is very high. Feeling inadequate, we have to widely solicit donations. If so, the ownerless lonely souls will suffer less from the dismemberment of corpses, and the common people in the wilderness will not suffer from the disaster of the epidemic. This is a win-win situation. If benevolent people are willing to donate generously, then not only will the dead receive great kindness, but the living will also receive infinite blessings. This is an appeal. Also, the previous report that Magistrate Lu of Qingpu County led his troops to surrender to the puppet regime has been corrected by the county government, which stated that it was completely untrue.

### Hu Siting Was Shot Dead. It Is Reported that There Was a Nature of Revenge, Involving the Bloodshed at the Wangjiasha Law School. It is Said that Hu Once Sniped Chen Jinbiao

At No. 1081 Jing'an Temple Road, Daxia University, at about 1:08 p.m. the day before yesterday, a sudden assassination occurred. The person shot was Hu Siting from Kunshan, 19 years old, a freshman in the law department of the school. He was hit by two bullets in the chest on the spot and died immediately. All the details have been recorded in the newspapers.

One Person Was Detained, Also a Student

According to Pingming News Agency reporters, after Hu fell to the ground after being shot, the shooter sneaked out of the school gate and fled along Jing'an Temple Road. At that time, he did not hide or abandon the gun he was holding. Two Chinese constables, No. 58 and No. 134, saw him and immediately pursued him, and as a result, they arrested the assassin and detained him in the Jing'an Temple Police Station, and then escorted him to the Central Police Station on Simalu. The pistol and bullet casings were also sent to the General Police Station for examination. It is said that the assassin is also a young man, one of the students of Daxia University, named Chen Yiping (but inquiries with the school authorities deny that there is such a student). The motive for the assassination is said to be revenge. The reason is that Hu Siting shot Chen Jinbiao, a student of the Shanghai Law School, on Aivenyi Road in the Wangjiasha Garden on April 12. He and Chen were close friends, and being moved by righteousness, he could not let him survive, so on that day he walked from Jing'an Temple Road into the Daxia school building and shot Hu directly. He did not give any verbal warnings beforehand. Currently, the police station is investigating the deceased Hu Siting's past political activities at the school and his relationship to the Wangjiasha bloodshed.

The Deceased's Unusual Activities on Weekdays

Hu Siting's father, named Wenkai, has been an editor at the Commercial Press, earning only a few dozen yuan a month, and his family is poor, so he lives very frugally. It is said that the son used to rent a room in a building on Aiduya Road under the name of the Sichuan Fellow Association as a cover, and internally specialized in a certain kind of work. Later, it moved to Cishu Building and was renamed the Shanghai Jiangbian Compilation and Translation Society. It held meetings once a week from 7 to 9 p.m. every Saturday. In the past, Hu also served the Party and the country and embraced the Three Principles of the People, but suddenly changed his attitude and secretly engaged in unusual activities.

### Four Gambling Dens in Shanghai Xi Were Closed Down Yesterday

The saying that Shanghai Xi gambling dens would be banned has long been rumored. Although a number of casinos, such as Guangsheng, Shenji, Xiangsheng, Rend, Jing'an, and Zhuan, were closed down last month, the larger ones were still operating as usual, and their business was more prosperous than before. Therefore, the small gambling dens that were closed down were actively discussing ways to deal with the situation and trying to resume business, but the Japanese side has not yet given a definite reply. On the morning of the day before yesterday (May 1), the director of the "Gambling Den Supervision Department", Yamaki, and the Chinese "chief in charge", Pan Sansheng, ordered four casinos, including Fusheng, Dasheng, Lianyi (that is, Kai Xile), and Xinxin, to close down. It is said that the owner of Fusheng is more flexible in his methods. It is said that he will resume business in four days, but according to news from the Japanese side, the existing casinos such as Hollywood have also been ordered to suspend operations within a certain period of time. As for the "Chinese General Association" in Jing'an Temple, because of its special license, the "Department" has no right to deal with it. It is said that it can be extended for six months.

### Suicide and Miscellaneous Records: A Woman's Bizarre Death, Double Suicide Attempt with Poison, One Dead, One Critical

Local woman Cao, aged 30, together with a man named Cao Zitian, aged 35, claiming to be her husband, arrived at the Da Fang Hotel at 35 Zhengjia Wood Bridge Street in the French Concession at 11:00 AM on the 30th of last month. They booked room 216 for lodging. At 2:00 PM, the man and woman went out together and returned to the hotel around 6:00 PM in the evening to sleep. The next morning around 6:00 AM, the man Cao Zitian went out alone, leaving the woman inside. She slept until 11:00 AM at noon and had not gotten up. The tea server Xu Dingchang (22 years old, from Ningbo) entered the room to inquire and discovered that Ms. Cao had died in bed. He immediately informed the accounting office, which reported to the French police. Detectives were dispatched to investigate and found what appeared to be strangulation marks on the deceased's neck and her fingernails were blue. The cause of death was unclear, so the body was sent to the Tongren Fuyuan branch morgue for examination. Yesterday, Prosecutor Zhao Changmin from the Special No. 2 Court was requested to come to the morgue to conduct an examination. The examination revealed that Cao had died of poison before her death. Because there was no way to find or summon her family, the official determined that the corpse should be handled by the charity for burial, pending family identification. However, the man who stayed with her, Cao Zitian, claiming to be her husband, did not return to the hotel. It is said that the police department dispatched detectives to investigate and investigate the cause of the woman's suicide. Zhang Yuansheng (28 years old) and his wife Zhang Wang (26 years old), arrived at the China Hotel at 241 Jie Road in the Public Concession at about 4 PM the day before yesterday. They booked room number 5 for lodging. Yesterday, at 11:15 AM, the tea waiter heard moaning from the room. He went to knock on the door, but there was no answer. He managed to pry open the door and saw Zhang and his wife lying on the bed with pale faces, moaning, and barely conscious. He saw an empty bottle of poisonous liquid on the table, indicating that they had taken poison. He immediately reported to the accounting office and summoned an ambulance to take the couple to the hospital for treatment. Zhang Yuansheng died of poisoning before reaching the hospital. Wang's life is also in critical condition. It is said that the reason for the suicide was economic pressure.

Pan Xiang, a young man from Suzhou, age 24, residing at 10 Bie Mo (phonetic) Ten Garden on Long Road, had just graduated from school last year during the winter vacation. He had been suffering from lung disease for four years. He had sought medical treatment repeatedly, even having his kidney removed, but none of the medicines were effective. He felt no joy in life and the future was bleak, so he held a pessimistic view. On the 29th of last month, he suddenly became desperate. That night, at 10:00 PM, he secretly swallowed poison at home to commit suicide. His mother discovered it and searched his bedside and found sleeping pills and an empty iodine bottle. He was immediately sent to Renji Hospital, but the treatment was ineffective, and he died at 2:00 PM on the 1st of this month.

### Sad Story of a Young Woman: Young Widow Subjected to Abuse by Step-Aunt, Attempted Joint Suicide with Daughter Unsuccessful, Spared Punishment

Yan Zhong, the daughter of Zhong Lu, a woman from Suzhou residing at No. 2, Lane 181, Xiaoshadu Road, 27 years old, was married eight years ago by her parents, through a matchmaker, to Zhi Qian (the son of Yan Jia Zhuo, Zi Junshu, the former Director of the Salt Affairs Inspection Office (i.e., the offspring of Yan Jiachi, Zi Mengfan, the former Director of the Jiangsu Finance Department of the Beijing Government and now the Vice Minister of Finance of the "Central Government" in Nanjing). She lived together at No. 25, Meilefang, Lane 210, Huanlong Road in the French Concession. However, since Yan Zhong married into the family, she has suffered greatly from abuse from her step-aunt and being in an old-fashioned family. Furthermore, her husband was studying at Soochow University in Suzhou, and he was unable to protect her. Unexpectedly, Zhi Qian became weak and went to Peking Union Medical College Hospital for treatment. He repeatedly sent letters to summon his wife to Beijing, but was blocked by his parents. It was not until Zhi Qian was terminally ill that Zhong was able to rush to his bedside. After a brief reunion, he died. At that time, Ms. Zhong's nerves were severely stimulated and she once jumped from the second floor in an attempt to commit suicide. She was rescued and spared from death. When she returned to Shanghai with the coffin, she was refused by her parents. Ms. Zhong took her daughter Qingyi (now eight years old) to Ningbo temporarily to live. It has been more than four years and her parents have not expressed any intention to take her back. She once requested living expenses from her parents and filed a lawsuit in the Suzhou court. The first instance ruled that she could receive more than 3,000 yuan in living expenses, but she lost the appeal. The case is now delayed in the Supreme Court. Ms. Yan comes from a well-known family, knows etiquette, and has received higher education. Being a young widow is already a tragedy in life. Being abandoned by her parents is even more painful. She has been living in Ningbo for four years. Although her parents have no complaints, she feels ashamed to live there for a long time when she occasionally thinks of the old etiquette of "a married daughter is like spilled water". She has no joy in life and nothing to look forward to. In a state of depression, she had suicidal thoughts. On April 26, at 5 PM, Ms. Zhong and her eight-year-old daughter Qingyi simultaneously swallowed three bottles of sleeping pills to commit suicide. Fortunately, the family discovered it early and sent them to the Red Cross Hospital for emergency treatment. The mother and daughter survived. The Jing'an Temple Police Station was notified and sent Detective Xie Futang to investigate. Because she had attempted to kill her daughter, Yan Zhong was sent to the Second Criminal Court of the Special First Court yesterday morning. The police initially charged her with murder under Article 271, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law. After questioning by Judge Fu, Yan Zhong confessed that she often kept sleeping pills because she suffered from insomnia after her husband's death. She had not forced her daughter to take poison and Yan Qingyi also testified that she had taken it herself. Under the defense of lawyer Wang Jianhang, police lawyer Zhang Tianyin also stated that he should be judged in accordance with Article 275 of the Criminal Law for attempting to commit joint suicide. Judge Fu reviewed the confession and sentenced Yan Zhong to be exempt from punishment for attempting to commit joint suicide and inciting suicide. Qingyi was taken back by her maternal grandmother.

### Case of Wu Qilun's Murder: Gu Zhuxuan Denies Instigation, All Criminals Have Confessed in the Police Station, Confession Forms Submitted to the Court, Gu Denies the Matter Outright, Adjournment Ordered for Further Investigation

The case of Gu Zhuxuan being accused of instigating the murder of lawyer Wu Qilun was heard in the Criminal Court One by Judge Feng Shide of the Special First Court yesterday afternoon. Gu's lawyers Wu Linkun, Jiang Baoli, Jiang Pingfan, and Qiao Yaoshan's lawyer Wang Yaofa were all present in court. First, police lawyer Ru Baoyi stated: The defendants related to the case of Wu Qilun's murder are Wei Shoulin, Wang Xingfang, Xia Shoufeng, Xia Guifu, Zeng Changchun, Qiao Yaoshan, and Gu Zhuxuan, a total of seven people. They are now being prosecuted in accordance with Article 171 of the Criminal Law. Gu Zhuxuan and Wu Qilun were acquainted and very friendly. Previously, Gu's apprentice Wang Xinggao killed Tang Jiapeng, and was arrested by the French police. Gu was also arrested for his involvement in instigating the crime. At that time, Wu Qilun was his lawyer. Afterwards, Gu expressed dissatisfaction because Wu had not done his best. Later, Wu represented Qiu Changyin in a guardianship case. As a result, the case was settled through Gu's mediation. Qiu sent a public fee of 30,000 yuan, but Gu did not share the money with Wu, causing Wu to complain. Gu hated Wu to the core because Wu publicized the matter, which affected his reputation. He discussed with his apprentice Qiao Yaoshan how to kill Wu. Qiao then contacted Zeng Changchun, and then successively found Wei Shoulin, Wang Xingfang, Xia Shoufeng, Xia Guifu, Wei Xiaohu (who was killed by the police in another theft case), and others. After discussion, they decided on a method to kill Wu Qilun and designated Xia Guifu as the executor. However, all the defendants did not know Wu Qilun's true face. Therefore, they sent Zeng to accompany Wei and Xia to visit Wu at his residence at No. 102, Tongfu Road, to handle the defense of Ding Shaokun (who had been arrested by the police for robbery and sentenced by the court). After Xia recognized Wu's face, they agreed to pay 100 yuan in public fees on the morning of March 4. That morning at 11:30, Wei Xiaohu, disguised as a rickshaw puller, pulled an empty rickshaw with a pistol borrowed from a certain organization in Shanghai West (the gun had been used in many cases in the concession). They set off together. After arriving at the destination, Wei handed the gun to Xia Guifu, who went to knock on the door, while the others were distributed to watch the wind. When Xia knocked on the door, Wu Qilun thought that someone was coming to pay the public fee, so he ordered his niece Wu Shaohua to open the door and invite the person into the living room. After only a few words, Xia took out the gun and fired three shots at Wu and fled. Wu died because the bullets hit vital parts. In the beginning, Gu was supposed to pay 2,000 yuan as a reward after the deed was done, but only paid 800 yuan. These facts were all confessed by the defendants, and the confession forms have been made. However, Gu Zhuxuan denied everything in the police station. Therefore, the confession forms were submitted to the court. Then, Wu Shaohua testified about the circumstances of Xia Guifu firing the gun at the time. Judge Feng often questioned Xia Guifu, Wei Shoulin, Wang Xingfang, and Zeng Changchun, and they all admitted to the fact of killing Wu without denying it. By this time, it was already dusk, so the court announced an adjournment for further questioning.

### Letter

To the Editor, We write to inform you that, according to Mr. Liu Huilin of Liu Yanghe Tang Traditional Chinese Medicine Shop, upon reading the news about the fire in Ningxing Street, French Concession, i.e., the Caishi (Vegetable Market) Street, published in your newspaper yesterday, he was greatly surprised that the statements made were inconsistent with the facts. Our shop has been located near Gaochang Temple in Nanshi for over 60 years after moving to the French Concession after the war. The report that our shop was originally located in Hongkou and moved to Caishi Street after August 13th is obviously hearsay and untrue. It is also untrue that the fire was caused by our shop accidentally burning ointment in the kitchen. Our shop usually closes at 9:30 PM every night and turns off the lights at 10:00 PM, so how could such an ointment burning event occur? Furthermore, the report that our shop has huge fire insurance is also inconsistent with the facts. Our shop has capital of more than 20,000 yuan, while the fire insurance is only 3,000 yuan, which is a far cry. The loss is quite large, so how can it be said that we have huge fire insurance? Also, the tenants of the second and third floors of the building leased by our shop, Dong and Bao, directly lease from the landlord Siming Real Estate Department. The report that these tenants sublet from our shop is obviously untrue. We are deeply concerned that this untrue news will lead to misunderstandings from all parties, and we have to entrust your lawyer to send a letter to Shen Bao and Xin Bao to declare a correction. We hereby forward the letter and request your newspaper to make a correction. Sincerely, Lawyer Jiang Chiping, May 2nd.

### Finance: Foreign Exchange Market Sees a Big Upsurge Yesterday, HSBC Supply is Thin, Black Market is Chaotic, British Exchange Approaches Four Shillings, U.S. Exchange Approaches Five Yuan Mark

Yesterday, the foreign exchange market saw HSBC consistently shrinking its quotes. The British exchange rate was revised to 3 shillings and 2.5 pence, and the US exchange rate was posted at 4.6875 yuan. The British exchange rate has reached its tightest quoted price since August 11 of last year, and the US exchange rate even broke the record of 5.5 yuan on September 19 of last year. Other exchange rates also shrank across the board. The domestic market situation was extremely chaotic. After the opening in the morning, rumors spread everywhere, causing unnecessary anxiety. As a result, buying surged, while selling was hard to find, and no transactions were made. There was no definite market price. Around 9:30 AM, it was heard that the British exchange rate was 3 shillings and 2.5 pence, and the US exchange rate was 4.625 yuan. Because HSBC and other foreign banks did not maintain their rates, public panic increased. Later, speculators and Chinese banks took advantage of the high prices to sell long positions, and the market temporarily stabilized. Before the close of the morning session, buying decreased slightly, and there was some relaxation. However, speculators fiercely pushed prices up again in the afternoon, and the tight situation returned. The reason was that foreign banks were unwilling to sell, and the closing results were 3 shillings and 3.75 pence for British exchange and 4.875 yuan for US exchange, a sharp decrease of 75 and 1.0625 yuan compared to the previous day. The futures trend was no different from the spot market.

However, the market was extremely chaotic at the time due to widespread rumors. Moreover, it was heard that HSBC and foreign banks had no intention to supply, so the public was panicked. There was buying in the market but no selling, so there were few transactions. It was not until around 9:30 AM that there was an official market price. British exchange rate was 3 shillings and 25 pence, and the US exchange rate was 4.625 yuan. The HSBC quotes were announced, with the British exchange rate changed to 3 shillings and 25 pence, and the US exchange rate to 4.6875 yuan. Other rates were reduced across the board. The silver balance tax was announced, an increase of 1.75 yuan. It was later heard that foreign banks were doing spot British exchange rate at 3 shillings and 375 pence, but the situation remained uncertain. Later, because Chinese banks and speculators profited from long positions, they came out of the market one after another, and slightly hardened. It is estimated that foreign banks absorbed spot US currency from Chinese banks at 4.8125 to 5 yuan, and soon speculators sold spot US currency to foreign banks already at 5.1875 yuan. The noon closing was still stable, with the British exchange rate being 3 shillings and a half penny, and the US exchange rate being 5.09375 yuan. The British exchange rate for the May contract was 3 shillings and 375 pence, and the US exchange rate was 4.9375 yuan, which was 625 lower for British and 84375 lower for American currencies compared to the morning opening.

Still Feeling Insufficient Funds in the Afternoon

In the afternoon, speculator's purchases and tight situation revived. It is estimated that speculators had purchased the May US exchange rate from foreign banks at 4.875 yuan and 4.75 yuan. After all, foreign banks still saw thin supply, and funds were often lacking. Until the evening closing, the situation recovered slightly, with the British exchange rate at 3 shillings and 375 pence, and the US exchange rate at 4.875 yuan. There were no transactions heard for the June British exchange rate being 3 shillings and 25 pence, and the US exchange rate at 4.6875 yuan. Compared to the overnight closing, the spot British exchange rate shrank by 75, and the US shrunk by 1.0625 yuan. This month, British and American currencies each softened by 6875 and 1 yuan.

### The Frenzy of Speculation: Gold Market Soars to the Heavens, Opening at a Peak Price of 6,700 Yuan

Yesterday, the cash "cooked red" (shà chì - slang for speculative) grey market was like a bolt from the blue, suddenly experiencing a horrifying surge. Those who heard of it were dismayed. The main reason was that speculators were spreading rumors, and operators were alarming each other, leading to an extremely tight foreign exchange market. The gold rush also surged accordingly. The market was chaotic in the early morning, opening only at 10 o'clock. Initially, bids reached 7,000 yuan, but the actual price was 6,700 yuan, a jump of 772 yuan. Later, many bullish investors took profits and exited, such as Qian Dui Ye and banks, selling heavily. In an instant, the price fell to 6,200 yuan. However, the situation suddenly improved towards the close, with the after-market opening jumping 190 yuan. This was due to the continued tightness of foreign exchange and the frantic search by gold shops and securities firms. The price even rose to 6,530 yuan, ultimately closing at 6,485 yuan, a sharp increase of 757 yuan compared to the previous day. However, according to the US dollar settlement price for the day, it was still more than 700 yuan lower. The future of gold prices is unpredictable and profound. Observing the increasing expansion of the European situation, if the United States is drawn into the war, gold may inevitably experience a reaction. Bullish investors without real strength should be cautious and prepare for the worst. The total trading volume for the day was about 5,000 taels. Jewelry gold in silver shops surged by 80 yuan, reaching an unprecedented peak price of 660 yuan. Customs gold, etc., remained flat.

"Cooked Red" Jumps 757 Yuan

From the morning, before 9 o'clock, people's minds were still stable. However, when the foreign exchange market opened at 9 o'clock, it was reported that there was a market without transactions, causing panic among the public. To avoid risks, people waited for the foreign exchange market to open before trading, so the market opened half an hour later than usual. Around 10 o'clock, a certain gold shop first bid to sell at 7,000 yuan, but at that time, only another gold shop offered to buy at 6,700 yuan. Soon, the opening price was seen at 6,700 yuan, a rare surge of 972 yuan compared to the previous day. Later, with the disappearance of buyers, the price plummeted by 200 yuan without any transactions. Afterward, with the outpouring from gold shops and silver shops, although a certain securities firm took the opportunity to absorb, the position ultimately felt full, and the price continued to fall by 250 yuan. The securities firm sold 50 taels to the bank at 6,250 yuan. Then, the bank suddenly advanced sharply, and sellers gradually decreased. The price jumped again by 250 yuan, with the bank taking 20 taels from Qian Dui Ye at 6,500 yuan. Later, as foreign exchange eased, a selling frenzy was reignited, and the securities firm suddenly reappeared. Gold shops and Qian Dui Ye also filled in, and soon the price fell back by 300 yuan. Deng Juan firm sold 30 taels to the bank at 6,200 yuan. It was heard that a few transactions were also made at 6,180 yuan, but some buyers with a limit price of 6,200 yuan did not succeed. After 11 o'clock, sellers gradually decreased, and a certain securities firm and bank suddenly started to collect, soaring the price by 190 yuan. The bank took 20 taels from the gold shop at 6,390 yuan. At that time, there were many sellers with a limit price of 6,400, and the price surge was blocked. Then, with the bank's reduced collection efforts, the price fell back by a small 130 yuan. The bank mutually transacted 30 taels at 6,260 yuan as the noon closing price. When the market opened in the afternoon, sentiment was surprisingly good. Gold shops raised prices to buy, jumping 190 yuan. The gold shop took 20 taels from the bank at 6,450 yuan. Later, the securities firm sold, immediately falling back by 70 yuan. The bank did 10 taels, at 6,380 yuan. Eventually, as foreign exchange became tight again, the securities firm suddenly advanced again, and Qian Dui Ye also bought, soaring 150 yuan. The gold shop took 30 taels from the bank at 6,512 yuan. Later, the buying frenzy gradually subsided, and gold shops suddenly intended to sell, filling in somewhat, immediately falling back by 130 yuan. The bank sold 20 taels to the securities firm at 6,400 yuan. Afterward, the securities firm came to search and purchase again, rising again. The securities firm took 20 taels from the gold shop at 6,485 yuan as the late closing price, resulting in a 757 yuan increase compared to the previous day. The price fluctuated by 500 yuan throughout the day. The selling price of cash gold from the main brand of gold shops was several tens of yuan higher than "cooked red," and the purchase price was reduced by 30 yuan. The current premium gold was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there were few transactions.

Silver Shop Jewelry Gold Rises by 80 Yuan

The initial selling price of jewelry gold in silver shops was still 580 yuan per tael at Datong Hang. By 10 o'clock, due to the surge in "cooked red," reaching nearly 1,000 yuan, the price was also raised by 70 yuan. At 1 o'clock in the afternoon, it rose by another 10 yuan, resulting in Datong Hang changing the listed price to 660 yuan. The new peers had the same price, and the purchase price was reduced by about 30 yuan. The above prices have all created unprecedented high prices since the market's inception.

### Securities: Fluctuations in Domestic Debt Not Yet Severe

The securities grey market yesterday suddenly experienced turbulence due to sudden changes in finance. Foreign exchange suddenly experienced extraordinary changes. In an instant, the US dollar shrank by more than one yuan, and gold soared by nearly 1,000 yuan, which was an unprecedented and strange change. It is said that the Hong Kong Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Committee has abandoned the maintenance of the standard. All Chinese and foreign banks in Shanghai refused to supply foreign exchange, and there was talk of the establishment of a pseudo-Central Bank. The market's morale was severely impacted by this huge change, and the rapid rise in prices caused panic among most people. The tightness of silver was even worse than five days ago, and there were rumors that several silver shops were unstable. In this tense market situation, public bonds were also affected by these unfavorable news and fell. However, there were also many who wanted to buy before selling. The situation will be clear in a day or two. Yesterday, Tong Kang bought in both the morning and afternoon, especially in the afternoon. The rest were mainly covering short positions. The outflow of spot goods occurred both in the morning and afternoon. In the morning, spot goods were delivered from numbers 12, 20, 22, 35, and 38. Xinfu and Yongkang slightly covered short positions. In the afternoon, Changmao and Lianhe sold in large quantities. Hengfu and number 38 still bought out. The market price rose by several dimes in the afternoon, but ultimately fell by a small two to six dimes. About 120 yuan was transacted. A brief table is listed below:

Stock trading: 50 shares of the Chinese Business Securities Exchange were transacted at a price of 28.5 yuan.

London 1st (Wednesday) Telegram: Today, the listed prices of British-owned Sudong companies' stocks. Bank stocks fell quite a bit. The stock price of Macquarie Bank fell by 2 shillings and 6 pence, to 9 pounds and 10 shillings. The stocks of Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank each fell by half a pound, to 93 pounds. Only the stock price of Gulack Lin rubber rose by 3 pence, to 18 shillings and 9 pence. The rest remained unchanged.

London 1st (Wednesday) Telegram: Today's listed prices of Chinese foreign debt: Crisp and Rehabilitation Loan British-issued bonds each fell by one pound, the former to 24.5 pounds, the latter to 35 pounds. The rest were flat.

### Coal: Coal Balls Increase by 23 Yuan, 8.5 Yuan Per Dan

Coal ball market: Yesterday, due to the sharp contraction of shillings and drastic changes in the foreign exchange market, all factories stopped trading in the morning. An emergency meeting was held in the afternoon, resolving that, effective immediately, the factory price for the industry would increase by 23 yuan. The opening prices for Yitaixing, Nanyang, Guohua coal balls are 158 yuan per ton from the factory, 1.25 yuan per bundle, and 8.5 yuan per dan at the street door shops. The opening prices for smoke-free white coal have not yet been announced, and no transactions have been made.

### Sugar Market: Foreign Exchange Contracts Sharply, Sugar Prices Soar

Yesterday, the sugar market experienced a sharp contraction in foreign exchange. Dutch exchange reached 8.750, then rose to 9.500 to 9.375. However, the association in this city drew the line, because the asking price of outgoing clients was too high, resulting in a lack of transactions. The spot price for Four Rivers coarse white new goods at the outer warehouse was 75 yuan, transit goods 60 yuan, Taikoo vehicle white B mark goods at the West warehouse was 85 yuan, and Dutch red 63 yuan. The degree of price increases reached about 10 yuan, so incoming clients were watching, and there were only no transactions. National sugar was also tight. It was heard that Diao Qing would open at 57-58 yuan, up 2-3 yuan, and the rest also asked for increases.

### Food: Amidst the Surging Gold Rush, Rice Merchants Greatly Display Their Speculative Skills. Cargo Owners Insist on Not Releasing, Conversely Promoting Market Prices to Rise Directly. Hearing that Gold Prices Have Fallen Slightly, They Fear They Won't Be Able to Get Rid of It in Time. As a Result, Both Foreign Rice and Japonica Rice Rose by One or Two Yuan

Since the previous dynasty, because the expiry date has passed, the sales market of rice has become more prosperous. The prices of various kinds of foreign rice have all risen by one yuan. For example, No. 1 Saigon had already been sold for 47 yuan, and small twisted rice for 43.5 yuan. Yesterday morning, inheriting the upward momentum, people's minds were particularly firm, and buying and selling were quite prosperous. The market immediately saw high prices. When news broke that gold prices had caused an unprecedented surge of 1,000 yuan, the city was instantly filled with storms and rain. People's minds were as if selling parties insisted on not getting rid of the stocks, and they actually came out to turn in the gains they made. The market was agitated for a time, and the shouting was chaotic. The market prices of various kinds of foreign rice increased sharply, with No. 1 Saigon reaching a maximum peak of 49 yuan, No. 2 at 47.5 yuan, and small twisted rice at 46.5 yuan, a sharp increase of three yuan compared to the previous market. From morning to noon, there was no slight setback, and it was not until the close of the market that news suddenly broke that gold prices had fallen back by 400 yuan that the market began to flag. Because the changes were so drastic, the resistance was also strong. If people's minds were not discouraged, then everything was fine, but if they were discouraged, the overall situation would be affected. At that time, everyone insisted on recovering losses, using every means to the extreme. By this time, they were afraid that they would not be able to get rid of the stocks in time, and they returned them one after another, causing a reverse situation to the early market, showing only release and no input, and market prices dropped step by step, suddenly shedding about 1.5 yuan. In the end, the market closed weakly, with a total increase of two yuan compared to the previous increase. No. 1 Saigon was 48 yuan, and small twisted rice was 40-45.5 yuan.

Although there were more than 2,000 packages of thick and thin japonica and other domestic rice arriving, because foreign rice soared, they were able to keep pace. Trading in the market was also changed to an off-market grey market. Because the price was lower than that of foreign rice, transactions were particularly numerous. Although they were also raised with each other, they were ultimately not as large as that of foreign rice, only rising or falling by one or two yuan. Transactions for Xibang special Qing japonica were 48 yuan, general market 47 yuan, powder japonica 46 yuan, Chang Kun white japonica 47.5 to 45.5 yuan, Qing Si special thin 47 yuan wholesale, general market 45-6 yuan, Zhongguan around 44 yuan, Nanhai early rice 45 yuan, special 46 yuan, secondary 43 yuan, Hu Jian 41-2 yuan.

Although the sales market for glutinous rice was not as wide as that of other goods, its price was the cheapest, and there were also large households hoarding and collecting, so market prices were also good. The price of Liyang special yuan was 41.5 yuan, general market 40 yuan, Chang Dan goods from 40 yuan, secondary to around 38 yuan.

Foreign rice was suppressed by the tightness of fourth-bottom funds, making it difficult to rise. In recent weeks, it has been difficult to revitalize. After the fourth-bottom term has passed, speculators are all eager to try, and they were suddenly hit by strange changes in the foreign exchange market. The market has reached a point where it is difficult to stop. The prosperity of the market's entry and exit, and the soaring of market prices, have been rare in recent months. Saigon No. 1 rose from 47 yuan to 49.5 yuan, and small twisted rice was even more prosperous, soaring even more. The opening price was 43.3 yuan, and it rose to 46.3 yuan, a total increase of three yuan compared to the previous day. At noon, many floating investors made profits and released their holdings, suppressing the price by nearly one yuan. However, the spot goods of the relending path were the target of speculators. This rose and that lifted, and the May increase rose to 56.8 yuan, an increase of 4.3 yuan compared to the end of last month. The spot goods had already reached 55.7 yuan, which was also a large increase of over three yuan. The market briefly returned to normal at noon, and then the market rose again in the afternoon, but the main business of those entering and leaving the market was the leather ball business. A total of about 600 tons of returned original packages were transacted, and 8-9,000 packages of spot rice.

### Flour Market Turns Firm

The flour market turned firm. Although the opening price of the No. 2 flour mill was still 13.5 yuan, the factory was quite likely to raise its prices. Because foreign exchange contracted sharply, the gold market surged, and commodity prices were all driven up. In the morning, old truck brand return goods tightened, and the opening price was over 13.47 yuan. The asking price for the afternoon market was already higher than the factory price. Most of those holding goods were defending the price, intending to wait for a good price, so the total number of transactions for various flours in the entire city was only about 10,000 packages. It was also heard that the customer price for artillery truck was 14.6 yuan, and the low-grade flour No. 4 was 12.4-5 yuan. Customers slightly decorated, but in the afternoon it was heard that the American bank came out to maintain foreign exchange, and the future of commodity prices is unknown.

The wheat market has long been in a flat and soft situation. Because export firms and Japanese factories have been inactive, only Chinese factories are handling affairs. At a time when inventory is drying up, both buyers and sellers are trending toward holding, and sellers are even more determined to sell. It was heard that about 1-2,000 packages of goods delivered to the factory were priced at 21 yuan, but transactions remained deadlocked.

### Yarn and Cotton: Yarn Also Soars, Double Horse Jumps 180 Yuan

The yarn market soared, and the changes in the situation were truly astonishing. The difference between the opening and closing prices was more than 200 yuan, and the state of the market was as chaotic as hemp. Due to the frequent news of sudden changes in foreign exchange, the price of 20-count Double Horse yarn for May immediately jumped 200 yuan, to 1,730 yuan. With the 70% price added, it has reached around 1,900 yuan. This situation is frightening.

The morning opening for spot yarn was flat because actual sales were weak and market sentiment was flat. In addition, the high and low prices of 20-count yarn were uneven and far apart. The opening price for 20-count variant horse was 1,465 yuan, a drop of 10 yuan. In an instant, news broke that foreign exchange had greatly changed and gold had soared, and the buying atmosphere suddenly became strong, immediately jumping straight to 1,685 yuan. Later, as those taking profits released their holdings, the price fell back to 1,600 yuan, and then rose again to 1,630 yuan at the close. After checking the transaction statistics for half a day, 2,155 packages were transacted. The market price for 20-count variant horse spot jumped 180 yuan. Two pieces of yarn were shipped to Ningbo today. The amount bought by each party is listed as follows:

Peers 1,450 Hong Kong 685

Mainland 20 Statistics 2,155

### Native Cotton Transactions Halted, Many Orders Opened for Indian Cotton

Native cotton transactions have completely entered the path of market stagnation. This is because after the drastic changes in the financial market, people's minds were frightened and uncertain, and the public should not trade.

In other news, the market price of foreign cotton, the New York cotton market, was very quiet yesterday, but quite firm. Later, due to the purchase by peers and the activity of some short-sellers, the closing price was higher than the previous day by one or two British pounds. In the Indian cotton market, yesterday's forecast fell by more than one rupee, and Egypt rose by more than ten British pounds.

The transaction of foreign cotton in Shanghai continued to be lively as usual, especially Indian cotton. This is because the selling price of Indian cotton is cheaper than American cotton. Because the spot goods in the market have been searched and emptied by all parties, there are many who ordered Indian cotton. All are ships departing from Western India on the 6th. Because the ships depart from Western India, the freight is relatively guaranteed. The following is the factory price converted at a rate of 6 yuan per US dollar for yesterday's cotton market:

### Piece Goods: Hoarding Eastern Piece Goods, The Rise is The Fiercest, The Leading Spot Good, Dragon Head Fine Cloth, Raised to 53 Yuan

Domestic Cloth: Yesterday, the sharp contraction of foreign exchange stirred people's hearts. Because of the small sales of cloth, the thoughts of cargo owners were different, so the market was extremely chaotic. Transactions of white cloth coarse cloth, fine cloth, and fine twill were traded at original prices and at increased prices of 5 dimes to 1.5 yuan. Later, the prices rose uniformly. The domestic peers traded more than 500 pieces, and the customer sales were still clear. The morning market searched and entered more than 300 pieces at a low price, which was also a hoarding nature.

Eastern Cloth: The rise was the fiercest, and the transactions were also the largest. The white cloth fine cloth and fine twill, internal and external traders searched and hoarded more than 2,000 pieces. Dragon Head fine cloth rose by 5.5 yuan per piece, and mid-range miscellaneous brands and fine cloth rose by about 3 yuan per piece. At the close, the spot price of Dragon Head fine cloth was 53 yuan, and the futures price was 54.5 yuan. The spot price of Sijunzi serge increased to 1.55 yuan per yard, and the futures price increased to 1.625 yuan.

### Market Situation Summary

Erratic Silk Transactions: Yesterday's silk market was extremely chaotic, mainly due to the sharp contraction of exchange rates, prompting foreign firms to scramble for purchases. Most transactions were based on quotations from the previous day's telegrams, resulting in price discrepancies of three to four hundred yuan compared to the day's market prices. Consequently, silk merchants largely adopted a wait-and-see attitude in the afternoon, ceasing trading activities. Yesterday, Da Chang, Jardine Matheson, and Shin Shing and other firms collectively purchased four hundred bales. White filature and various reel silk grades were traded. All selling prices increased by fifty to two hundred yuan compared to the previous day's records. Although the prevailing sentiment is bullish, the silkworm cocoon harvesting season is approaching, and the rise in silk prices may cause more harm than good to future operations.

Slight Movement in Green Tea Exports: Yesterday, the price of green tea in various European estates was driven by the soaring gold prices and the sharp contraction of foreign exchange rates. Regarding Chunmee and Gunpowder tea, Jardine Matheson, Concordia, Tungkfook, Paochong and other firms purchased a total of over five hundred and ninety boxes of green tea. Selected Chunmee tea was sold at prices ranging from three hundred to three hundred and twenty-eight yuan, unselected Chunmee tea at one hundred and ninety to two hundred and forty yuan, and Gunpowder tea at two hundred and eighty to three hundred and ten yuan.

Soybeans Rise by Four to Five Yuan: Yesterday, the market for miscellaneous grains and soybeans was hit by turbulent waves, causing people to hesitate to sell their goods easily. The market was filled with buying interest but lacked sellers. Speculators were actively entering and exiting the market, creating unusual volatility. Consequently, the soybean market surged by four to five yuan (market price). The bean market rose sharply by one to two yuan.

Golden Needles and Hunan Lotus Seeds Both Rise: Among the northern goods, golden needles, tree ears, and Hunan lotus seeds have seen price increases of ten to twenty yuan due to demand from Hong Kong and their connection to foreign exchange. Tree ears were quoted at three hundred and twenty yuan. Locally grown lotus seeds, previously offered at one hundred and eighty-two yuan, were quoted at two hundred yuan yesterday. Top-grade vegetables, previously at fifty yuan, were quoted at four hundred and sixty yuan, with reported transactions at fifty-five yuan.

Seafood Held Back in Anticipation: Most seafood is imported and thus heavily influenced by foreign exchange rates. Therefore, major seafood dealers are adopting a wait-and-see approach and temporarily withholding sales. The expected price increase is approximately thirty percent.

Woolen Fabrics Continue to Arrive in Shanghai: Imported woolen fabrics from countries such as England, the United States, Japan, and Italy continue to arrive in Shanghai. Most are urgently needed fabrics such as feather yarn wool, heavy tweed, "baratheas", worsted coating, white serge, white drill, and "Wan Li Ding" fabrics. Customs clearance is extremely congested, as most of these goods were sold earlier and are now awaiting delivery upon arrival. Market price: Thursday, May 2, Year 29.

### Old News Rehashed: Sixty-Seven Years Ago (372)

(Seen in this newspaper, published in the twelfth year of the Tongzhi reign of the Qing Dynasty)

### Cricket Tomb

A certain person was fond of cricket fighting. In the autumn of the previous year, he obtained a cricket that won repeatedly, earning him over a thousand gold coins. When the cricket died, he placed it in a silver coffin, engraved with a jade tablet, and inscribed it with "General Speedy and Agile". It was buried in the flower bed of the backyard, with a rounded tomb. Last autumn, after the White Dew season, his old addiction resurfaced. He sought crickets everywhere but found none to his liking. One evening, he was walking alone in the backyard when he suddenly heard a cricket chirping sound. Upon listening closely, he realized it was coming from the tomb. He dug up the tomb to find it, but saw nothing. Opening the silver coffin, he found that the cricket he had buried stiff and lifeless was now lively, flapping its wings, baring its fangs, and ready to fight. The man was overjoyed, thinking it was the reincarnation of the general. He took it out and fed it. When he tested it against the crickets he had, they were all easily defeated. He then took it out to gamble a little, and every bet was successful. From then on, he cherished it like a treasure, and would not bet a single fight unless for a large sum. The next day, a guest from Hangzhou visited him, bringing a basin and asking for a bet. The man saw that the guest's cricket was not very strong, so he increased the bet, agreeing to ten gold coins per "flower", with a hundred "flowers" determining the winner. The guest was not satisfied and proposed to add more. So, the two crickets were placed in the basin. As soon as they met, the man's cricket turned around and ran away. When forced to fight again, it jumped around endlessly, and then suddenly died. After the man paid off the bets he lost, he realized that he had used up all the winnings from the previous autumn, and it was still not even half of the debt. This year, after the spring sun greened the backyard, the man idly walked past the cricket tomb and angrily dug up and destroyed the tomb.

Spring and Autumn Annals

### The Art of Speaking (2)

Even when subjected to great anger, he remained silent. The prophecy of Isaiah perfectly describes Jesus: "He was crucified with criminals, buried with the wicked, although he had committed no crime and no deceit was found in his mouth." The Roman judge, in Caesar's judgment hall, said to Jesus, "Don't you hear how many accusations they are bringing against you?" Jesus did not answer a word, which greatly astonished the judge. When Jesus remained silent, Pilate brought him to the front of the palace and said to the crowd, simply and truthfully, "Behold, the man!" Even when subjected to great anger and injustice, when all his instincts urged him to speak to avoid regret, he remained silent as usual. This requires true courage and true spirit. From this, we can see the greatness of Jesus. Jesus understood the value of silence and strictly controlled his ability to speak. Secondly, we see that Jesus spoke cautiously. When he spoke, he carefully chose his words, selecting those of value and speaking concisely, not wasting a single word. Every word has some meaning for life, and every character reveals his own personality. I remember when the United States held the dedication ceremony at the Gettysburg battlefield, the great American orator Hale spoke for over an hour, while Lincoln only spoke for seven minutes, yet his words have been translated into the languages of the world and passed down for millennia. From the four Gospels, we can see that Jesus's words can be read in thirty-five minutes, so short, yet the most quoted. Thus, the value of words lies not in quantity but in quality. Our fortune, misfortune, joy, and sorrow often come from the words we speak. The ability to speak is our greatest asset, but also our greatest danger. "Who is wise and understanding among you? Let them show it by their good life, by deeds done in the humility that comes from wisdom." For detailed study, please write to P.O. Box 1227.

### Re-Emphasizing the "Safety Campaign"

– Lessons from the Past

In major cities, the number of innocent people who die under the wheels of vehicles each year is a terrible record. Last autumn, the authorities of the two concessions in Shanghai held a "Safety Campaign", which was a good idea. According to reports at the time, during the period of large-scale publicity and implementation involving filming movies, posting slogans, and students from various schools providing services on the roads, the number of vehicle accidents did decrease. However, although people feel fear towards the threat of death, they quickly forget the warning that "roads are like a tiger's mouth, do not walk in the middle". Drivers also fear legal trouble after causing accidents, but the "I am the only one who matters" mentality continues. Therefore, once the "publicity" period is over, everyone seems to "guarantee safety" and forget everything completely.

The so-called "Safety Campaign" naturally involves cooperation between pedestrians and drivers, but in many cases, there are situations that pedestrians cannot prevent. Let me give you the best example I have at hand, which is the injury to both feet of Yan Chuntang, the owner of Yihua.

The fault was naturally not with Mr. Yan, because no matter how crowded the passengers are, the driver cannot start the car immediately unless the doors are closed. If the ticket seller rings the bell early, then the ticket seller and the driver should jointly bear the responsibility, because they are the closest collaborators on the car.

Furthermore, due to the occurrence of this tragedy, there are a few points that must be said about the drivers and ticket sellers of Route 10 buses – in fact, they are also their faults, because even if they do not cause accidents, their dereliction of duty is a fact.

We know that Route 10 buses are the most crowded vehicles, and it is common for them not to stop due to the large number of passengers at the station (it is hoped that the company can add more vehicles). However, this has caused drivers to develop a habit of sometimes stepping on the accelerator and driving forward even when the car is not very crowded, leaving many passengers waiting at the station. Thus, after one, two, or even three cars have passed, the passengers at the station line up like they are buying cheap rice. In this way, when the fourth car comes, it is naturally impossible to accommodate so many passengers. The ticket seller ringing the bell early occurs at this time, and the tragic incident of the unfortunate passenger having their feet run over also occurs at this time.

This is just one example, and other trams or trolley buses also have this situation.

Let me say it again, the "Safety Campaign" is cooperation between pedestrians and drivers, but deliberately betting one's life and vehicle is ultimately a joke. Therefore, drivers paying attention to their duties is also the way to "safety".

The "Safety Campaign" is not a "fun fair", just as driving is not a simple mechanical task.

### "Can't Live On"

— Chen Can

Passing by Race Course Road, several rather large, thin chalk characters: "Can't Live On," burst into my sight. Followed by a mother with a drooping head, holding an infant less than a year old in her arms, and beside her, a boy and a girl, silently kneeling and begging for the sympathy of passersby.

"Can't Live On!" What a desperate, simple, and powerful cry, it strongly expresses the desire to survive; it is more direct and to the point than a long and verbose "complaint to the authorities."

A crowd was gathered around, gazing at them, and occasionally one or two passersby would squeeze in to take a look, but then go away looking blank. Are they so heartless? Seeing these people who seem to be straight out of a Masureller woodcut, they are unmoved and do not extend a hand of sympathy. But you are wrong to think so, these hurried and anxious strangers, perhaps they themselves should be classified as "Can't Live On"!

However, on this isolated island, there are also plenty of people living too well: high-rise buildings, beautiful wives and concubines, luxurious clothing and fine food, responding to every beck and call. The urgent, simple, and powerful cry of "Can't Live On," they cannot see it, and will never hear it, because they live in another world.

But please, take out your compassion, you must know that the group of "Can't Live On" are also our descendants of Yan and Huang. According to the meaning of "sharing the same boat in the storm," the valuable things we rescue them from the line of starvation, only require you to moderate your extravagant lifestyles a little, with a small effort, you will help others considerably.

We should enable people who "Can't Live On" to all live on!

### A Question

— Xin Yin

A little after four o'clock, the tram was so crowded that it was almost impossible to breathe.

At Rue Cardinal Mercier, many passengers got off, and there was much more space on the platform. After the tram started moving, the driver said first:

"Those two 'Chi Laos' have gone. I wonder if the old man had anything stolen?"

"I don't know, I suppose they wouldn't go empty-handed." The ticket seller replied.

A passenger asked, seemingly not understanding:

"What are 'Chi Laos'?"

"Pickpockets!"

"Those two?" The passenger continued to ask.

I did not hear the ticket seller's reply, but wondered in my heart:

"Since you knew, why didn't you catch them?"

Avenue Mesny arrived, and the passengers got off one after another, and I followed and got off the tram too.

Chapter 23: Old Friends and New Acquaintances, Writing Has Value; Famous Scenic Spots, Well-Managed People

Jin Danyun had already secretly informed Zhu Airen to set her mind at ease. Moreover, the Suliya couple wanted to visit their hospital and infant asylum in a few days. Therefore, Zhu Airen thought: instead of visiting the hospital and infant asylum in a few days, why not visit them now? So she said, "Then after we send Sister Junsu to school today, why not go to our Anle Town to see our country hospital and country infant asylum? If you don't mind the humble accommodations, would you like to have a simple meal with us there?" Jin Danyun said, "No! Our itinerary has already been arranged. After we send Sister Junsu back to school, we will go to Yuantouzhu in Wuxi for lunch. This was arranged in advance, and we are guests of Mr. Xue, an engineer and old classmate of Jiancheng and his wife. This Mr. Xue is the deputy manager and chief engineer of the Taihu Cement Company. In the evening, we will rush to Huzhou and stay at the Huanhu Third Hotel, and someone will also treat us to dinner, namely Jiancheng's elder sister and brother-in-law. They live in Huzhou, which was also arranged in advance. Tomorrow morning, we will return to Jiaxing, and someone has also arranged lunch. After returning to Suzhou from Jiaxing, we might be able to visit Anle Town, and then return to Shanghai." "Zhu Ai" said, "That's fine then! Let's decide on visiting Anle Town tomorrow afternoon. I'll take this ride to return to the hospital. It's just that we're troubling you along the way, which makes us very uneasy. What should we do?" Jin Danyun said, "We're like sisters, why speak so politely?" At that time, the two Miss He originally wanted to invite Lin Jiancheng, Engineer Lin, to see the site of their factory in Freedom Village, which they planned to build. It was just that they were on their honeymoon vacation, so it was difficult to mention it. Today, knowing that they were going to Anle Town tomorrow afternoon, and that Anle Town was not far from Freedom Village, they could take this opportunity to invite the couple to see the factory site in Freedom Village, so that they could have a rough idea of it. At that time, the two Miss He took the opportunity to tell Jin Danyun, and Jin Danyun immediately agreed, saying, "Definitely, and we also want to visit Village Chief Zhu, Mr. Zhu, in Freedom Village. He was still a comrade of my late father, and also the most respected elder by my late father." The two Miss He happened to have this opportunity, and naturally they were overjoyed. As they were talking, the car gradually approached Suzhou, which was a bustling town, and the Bao'en Temple Pagoda in Suzhou was already towering in sight. Mrs. Suliya said, "What is this place?" Wu Junsu said, "This is called Waikuatang, a town in the northeast of Suzhou." So she asked Jin Danyun, "I'll get on the bus here, so I can get to my school."

Entertainment World

### A Few Suggestions Regarding Domestic Films

— Qiu Xi

In recent years, the production of "historical costume dramas" can truly be described as surging like a storm. Great Wall is invincible, but observing their content, nineteen out of ten take the romantic affairs of "talented scholars and beautiful ladies" as their subject matter. This kind of "historical costume drama" can only suit the tastes of a certain group of people. In the eyes of young children, it does not evoke any interest. Therefore, I hope that the authorities of various domestic film companies, when choosing materials in the future, will carefully consider adopting more good materials related to national child heroes in history, which I believe is also urgently needed by young children!

Living on today's isolated island, the difficulties encountered by young people, and the temptations of evil forces, are all enough to make them numb, sink, and degenerate, because they are far away from the embrace of the motherland. Here, we can use subtle methods to shoot some conscious films to inspire their will, point out their paths, and let them know how they should fight against the strong enemy at hand!

As for the historical data of national child heroes, there are many, such as Zai Qi of the State of Lu in the Spring and Autumn Period, who, in order to defend his motherland and save the country from danger, took up arms and bravely killed the enemy, and the heroic deeds of dying on the battlefield. Shi Tongzi of Jiading in the Ming Dynasty, who made sacrifices to resist the enemy, and Xia Cungu of Songjiang in the late Ming Dynasty—this journal previously published Mr. Haixing's "Child Hero Xia Cungu," saying that Wei Ruohui is now engaged in adapting it into a children's historical drama—when the Qing soldiers went south, he resolutely joined the army to plot the restoration of the country. The stories that can be sung and wept over are all good subjects for realistic shooting.

In addition, there are also the struggle histories of famous people in history during their childhood, which are all worthy of emulation and practice by modern young children.

### Review of the Wing On Amusement Society's Charity Performance of "Pan Jinlian"

— Wu

The Wing On Amusement Society, organized by colleagues from the Wing On Company, was invited by the Shanghai Relief Committee for Zhongshan Refugees to perform a charity performance at the Lyceum Theatre for eight consecutive evenings. The reporter drove to watch on the evening of the 30th. The performance that evening was the society's newly adapted and improved "Pan Jinlian."

The play lasted four hours. The plot was intense, and the atmosphere was tense all the time. The plot depicts Pan Jinlian as a victim of forced marriage under the feudal system. It was adapted by Mai Youyun, and is sad and beautiful, with profound plots and demanding singing and acting. The playwright's mastery of Chinese classics is profound, and the lyrics are ornate and beautiful, thorough and exquisite. The dialogue in the play is witty and ambiguous, with endless aftertastes. The wording is subtle, and is appreciated by both the refined and the common. Only a master can achieve this.

The protagonist Guo Linshuang's Wu Song is heroic and majestic in appearance, agile and steady in his movements, and has a clear voice. The two scenes of killing his sister-in-law and offering sacrifices to her spirit are passionate, tragic, and touching. His recitations and singing have a magnetic sound, and are mournful and powerful. Zhong Fenghua's Pan Jinlian is also very exquisite in her performance, from the initial gentleness to the subsequent coquetry when teasing her uncle; when rejected, she is both hateful and surprised, and the twists and turns of her emotions are fully conveyed. Her voice is as thin as a gossamer thread, and stops the clouds in their tracks. Mr. Mai plays Ximen Qing, and his free and unrestrained manner gives people a deep impression, and his pronunciation is clear throughout the performance. Liang Yimin portrays Wu Dalang vividly, bringing out his personality perfectly; the scene of saying goodbye to his brother is deeply emotional and sincere. Tang Guanpeng's Uncle Jiu is full of energy, has a mellow singing voice, and is serious in his movements, but is slightly overdone. The other supporting actors are well-matched and complement each other perfectly.

As for all the sets, costumes, props, and lighting, they are luxurious and novel. Reading the society's special publication, I know that "Xi Shi" and "The Peach Blossom Fan" have more nationalistic ideas. I believe that the ticket prices for this charity performance, five yuan, ten yuan, and twenty yuan, are quite expensive, but this is inevitable because it is a charitable event. If the ticket prices could be lowered slightly for general public performances, wouldn't the benefits to the world and people's hearts be great?

### The Children of Stars

— Qing

The children of stars, although they have no direct relationship with the silver screen, after ten or twenty years, they will surely be the substitutes for the current popular stars!

Maureen O'Sullivan and her late husband had a son and a daughter, both of whom are very beautiful. The son is about the same age as Baby LeRoy, and the daughter is five years old this year, and her name is Kathleen.

Dick Powell has three sons: one is from Joan Blondell's previous husband, and the other two are his official sons. The older one is only two years old, and the younger one is only one year old.

Myrna Loy's son is already twenty-five years old, and is three inches taller than her when he stands up.

Although Loretta Young is not yet married, she has already adopted a son. He is three years old this year and is named Judy.

Dan Dailey already has three sons, one named Donny, one named Ronny, and one named Tommy. Now he only hopes to have a beautiful daughter.

Robert Taylor has a godson named Dean, who was adopted by Barbara Stanwyck.

Joan Bennett gave birth to a daughter when she was seventeen, and gave birth to another daughter after marrying Gene Markey.

Annabelle and her ex-husband have a five-year-old daughter. Recently, because Tyrone Power wanted to experience being a father, he specially asked his French ex-husband to give her back.

### British and French Ambassadors Host International Charity Performance

— Li Wen

Drama Society Performs Famous Play "Wu Zetian"

When the Shanghai Drama Society was performing at the Lyceum Theatre, there was already news of an international charity performance, but it later subsided. Now, this charity performance has become more concrete. It can be said that the drama circle is having a relationship with the international community for the first time, because it is hosted by the British and French ambassadors and performed by the Shanghai Drama Society. The Drama Society had carefully considered the repertoire for this grand performance. At that time, it was planned to perform a play translated from British and French works. However, thinking that using the Chinese stage techniques, which have not yet reached the pinnacle of perfection, to perform foreign plays, foreign audiences may not be satisfied. So it was decided to perform a play with strong Chinese flavor.

"Wu Zetian" was decided under such circumstances. Wu Zetian is the only female emperor in Chinese history, and many foreigners know about her experiences. This can not only arouse the interest of foreigners, but also allow foreigners to have a real understanding of her. The date of the performance has been decided to be held on the evening of May 22nd, and the ticket prices are divided into two types: five yuan and ten yuan. The Drama Society attaches great importance to this performance, and the selection of actors is especially meticulous (Xia Xia will still play the role of Wu Zetian), and it is scheduled to be previewed once on May 3rd. The ticket prices for this preview will be the same as usual.

### News from the Acting World

— Hai

Zhao Ruquan, the pillar of the Gong Wu Stage, met with the important performers and chief screenwriter Chuan Xiaobo the night before yesterday to discuss six new plays about the Living Buddha Jigong. It is said that the stage's leading actress has secretly persuaded Dan Bai Sulian to join.

He Yuru, the up-and-coming actor of the Geng Xin troupe, has submitted his resignation to the authorities and returned the advanced engagement fee of 140 yuan. However, manager Yun Jiqian cannot make a decision on the departure of the performers because Dong Zhaobin is still in Beiping and needs to wait for Mr. Dong to return to resolve the matter. He Yuru's request has not been accepted.

Dan Yu Sulian went to Ningbo to negotiate the troupe's performance. She will return to Shanghai today, but there is news that Ningbo has suspended entertainment, so whether she and they can go to perform is a question that will have to wait for Sulian to return to decide.

Wusheng Li Shunlai left the Da Wu Stage the day before yesterday. He is preparing to cooperate with Yu Sulian and go to Ningbo.

The five episodes of The Vegetarian General by the Carlton Theatre have already distributed the scripts to the actors the day before yesterday and rehearsed the play once. Rehearsals began last night.

### Regulations of the American Film Censorship Board - May Our Country's Filmmakers Pay Attention

— Dani

On March 31, 1930, the American Film Censorship Board convened all filmmakers to jointly formulate and abide by the following articles. Among them, the "Special Regulations" have excessively detailed outlines, and due to space limitations, it is not convenient to copy them verbatim. Here, the three articles of the main text are excerpted and translated here for the reference of filmmakers in our country. Especially in today's isolated island, the film industry has developed abnormally. Works that inspire justice and promote popular morale are already common, but there are also many that are vulgar and boring. I hope that all filmmakers will correct their mistakes if they have them, and encourage themselves if they do not, which is the motivation for the author to excerpt and translate this article.

Main Text

(1) Productions that are lower than the moral standards of the audience are strictly prohibited. In other words, films that are sufficient to promote the audience's tendency to commit crimes and bad behaviors should be made to disappear.

(2) If it is necessary to change the existing social life system or state due to the needs of the plot, this layer can be accommodated and handled.

(3) Productions that produce ridicule of the law, or indirectly encourage blasphemy of the law are not allowed.

### A Record of the Chess Tournament for the Soldiers in Chongqing

— Xinsheng

(Chongqing Correspondence) Our country's chess master, Mr. Xie Xiaxun, arrived in Chongqing last month from Kunming. He recently participated in a chess tournament for the soldiers. Here is a brief description:

The preliminary round opened at 7:00 p.m. on April 7th in the hall of the Sino-French-Swiss-Belgian Alumni Association.
