Chongqing: Yunnan Province Chairman Long Yun reportedly told a certain foreign traveler visiting Chongqing from Kunming that Yunnan Province and himself would adhere to any decision made by the Central Government to address the situation in Vietnam without question.

Hanoi: According to Japanese sources, it is widely expected that negotiations between Japan and France regarding Vietnam will conclude within days. Subsequently, a Japanese inspection group and Vietnamese authorities will hold a roundtable conference here to establish a detailed agreement. (Reuters, 13th)

Moscow: The Soviet newspaper Pravda commented on the international situation today, stating, "Since France's defeat, Britain, with American aid, continues to wage war against Germany and Italy. The war has now entered a new phase. The current situation is extremely complex due to the absence of land battlefields. On the continent, Britain has no base to wage war against Germany. As for the work of the German command, it is also extremely complex. Unless the war has moved to Britain, Germany fears it will be unable to cause the collapse of the British army and inflict fatal blows on its key centers. In short, if the Anglo-German war is limited to the sea and air, the war will inevitably be prolonged. American imperialism is eager to see the war prolonged so that the United States can, according to a new interpretation of the Monroe Doctrine (i.e., the Americas for the Americans), safeguard American influence in the Americas. At the same time, the strengthening of British resistance will facilitate the United States in resolving problems in the Pacific. One of the tasks of the United States in the Pacific is to prevent Japan from taking advantage of the European situation to enhance its position in the Pacific. The Dutch East Indies and Vietnam have attracted Japan's attention. Japan intends to strengthen its position in the Dutch East Indies, but to avoid further straining US-Japan relations, Japan has placed its main pressure on Vietnam. The Japanese side believes that since France has been defeated, it will not have strong resistance. Japan intends to use Vietnam as a base for operations against China and to control the Vietnamese market. According to foreign newspapers, Germany and Italy do not object to preventing Japan's expansion, so the Governor-General of Vietnam has adopted a firm attitude." (TASS, 13th)

Guilin: Sao Dang Bao newspaper yesterday advocated that the Chongqing government should conclude a military mutual assistance alliance with the Vichy government to defend Vietnam. The newspaper pointed out that the Chinese army is the only armed reinforcement closest to Vietnam in the event of an attack on Vietnam. Therefore, Vietnam should know that approaching the Chinese National Government and concluding this agreement is essential. The newspaper continued, "The Japanese inspection commission in Vietnam is actually nothing more than a disguised espionage organization. In other words, the commission is the Fifth Column in Vietnam and also the vanguard of the Japanese army to conquer Vietnam. Japan is planning to replay the Manchurian Incident in Vietnam, so the situation in Vietnam is becoming increasingly critical, which is an undeniable fact. Whether the Vichy government is still considering whether to acknowledge Japan's repeated demands, or quickly join hands with the Chinese army, we are really baffled." (United Press, 13th)

Singapore: According to a Bangkok correspondent for the Straits Times, Thai parliamentarians have recently demanded that the government demand the return of a portion of land within French Indochina that previously belonged to Thailand. People in the northern provinces of Thailand, in a petition submitted to parliamentarians, insisted that it is most appropriate to make demands to France at this time. This information was first disclosed by Thai newspapers. (United Press, 13th)

Recently, he received seven hundred kyats in matured insurance money from a life insurance company, equivalent to three thousand yuan in national currency, and donated the entire amount to the motherland to fund the care of refugee children. The funds have been remitted to Madame Chiang Kai-shek, who in turn forwarded them to the Children's Welfare Association.

### Water Level of the Red River in Vietnam; Gradually Receding; Major Disaster Averted

Hanoi: Recent floods on the Red River have turned the banks into swamps. Now the water level has receded slightly. The water level near here dropped to 10.97 meters this afternoon. Except for two small dikes at Baningtan and Pingtan being washed away, causing ten villages and thousands of acres of fertile land to be submerged, the main dikes remained intact.

Editorial

### A Comprehensive View of the World Situation

Is the Far East situation merely a part of the overall world situation? Or is the entire world situation originating and ending in the Far East, with the Far East as its pivotal point? Taking a comprehensive view of the overall situation, we firmly believe that the Far East is where the center of gravity lies.

Judging from the current state of affairs: The biggest event in the overall situation is the German-Italian attack on Britain. As British Lloyd George recently stated: "The attack on Britain has not truly begun; but the struggle against the British Empire has undoubtedly already commenced. The biggest target of the German-Italian attack is the British Empire, which occupies one-fifth of the earth's surface, and the attack on the British Isles is only a part of it." The British Isles are the headquarters of the British Empire, but the center of gravity of the empire is not actually in the British Isles, but built on its exclusive dominance of world sea power. Therefore, if Germany and Italy want to crush the British Empire, they must inflict a fatal blow on the British navy, which maintains its maritime hegemony. However, the navies of Germany and Italy, even if added to part of the French navy that can be coerced, are still not enemies of the British navy. Therefore, Germany and Italy are weakening the strength of the British navy through aerial bombardment and submarine attacks, while at the same time wooing maritime allies to help them, and Japan is a relatively good target. On the German-Italian side, whether the Japanese navy participates in the war must be a condition for Germany and Italy to recognize Japan as an allied country. On the Japanese side, burdened by the Sino-Japanese War, it cannot and does not want to add the navy to the German-Italian front and make an isolated gamble that cannot be won. As for Britain, although it does not think that Japan joining the German-Italian front would be something the British navy cannot handle, it does not want to allow Japan to increase the weight of Germany and Italy. The German-Italian and British pursuit of Japan at sea is the extent to which Japan wants to use diplomatic maneuvering to the fullest extent with Germany and Italy. If the world situation simply evolved in this way, Germany and Italy would inevitably compete to add value, and the inevitable limit of the competition would be the inevitable limit of Japan's diplomatic maneuvering, and the world situation in the near future would also use this saturation point as the axis of development. However, the overall situation is not that simple, because there are also complex and far-reaching Far East issues at the same time; and surrounding the Far East issues, there are still three sets of diplomatic functions: British-American, American-Soviet, and Soviet-British, which can have a profound impact on Japan's future with Germany and Italy and Britain; not only that, France's Far East policy also has very subtle points in the overall world situation. From this point of view, it cannot be said that the Far East situation is only a part of the overall world situation, that is, it cannot be said that the Far East situation is waiting for the decision of the overall world situation.

To put it simply, changing a point of view, please examine the overall situation from the Far East: the biggest event in the Far East is of course the Sino-Japanese War. For Japan, it has hoped for a quick victory from the beginning, that is, it hopes to complete everything through military means; this has been the case for three years, and now the so-called all-out effort to resolve the incident means the same, and it is even more urgent. The difference is that three years ago, it was confident and acted alone; now, it focuses on third countries, wanting to completely cut off China's overseas access; it is gradually encroaching on Hong Kong, Macau, Guangzhou Bay, Vietnam, and Burma, and has achieved temporary success to varying degrees. These kinds of successes do not have any successful factors themselves, but because the British and French themselves have defects; the Soviet Union itself has no defects, so the land route between China and the Soviet Union must always be unimpeded, and Japan must not make ineffective attempts against the Soviet Union. Even in terms of what Japan has temporarily succeeded in, it will of course cause temporary inconvenience to China, but it cannot achieve the desired effect, because China does not stop the War of Resistance due to this temporary inconvenience in actual action. What's more, following Japan's temporary success: First, any country with a stake in the Far East more clearly understands the insatiable nature of Japan's expansionist desires; Second, France is reconsidering its compromise policy and choosing between abandoning and resisting; Third, Germany is considering whether to simply give Japan a free lunch and reap the benefits without any effort; Fourth, Britain resolutely makes all preparations for any eventuality due to the pain of experience; However, the United States feels that the flames have indeed approached the Philippines' doorstep, accelerating the advancement of its firm policy; It also gives China a good opportunity to obtain a favorable new battlefield to disperse Japanese forces and develop a strategy of attrition. Therefore, Japan's temporary success is by no means a continuation of success and an increase in the results of the war; on the contrary, it makes the Far East issue more complicated and increases Japan's difficulties. The essence of the European War is Germany and Italy against Great Britain; while the Far East is evolving into a situation where most countries are against Japan.

### China Air Force Authorities Announce; The Air Force's Progress Over the Past Three Years; Hoping the People of the Country Will Assist in Aviation Construction; Hoping Overseas Chinese Will Contribute Human and Financial Resources

Chongqing: The Chinese Air Force authorities, on the occasion of Air Force Day today, announced the progress of the Chinese Air Force over the past three years, stating briefly that on August 14th three years ago, the Chinese Air Force fought and won against the elite Japanese Kisarazu Air Group in the skies over Jianqiao, Hangzhou, creating a new era. At that time, the courage and heroism shown by the emerging Chinese Air Force shocked people around the world. In the past three years, all officers and soldiers of the Air Force have continued to maintain this glorious victory and have developed a more courageous and heroic fighting spirit, and have created many amazing results. In order to win glory for the great Chinese nation and to meet the greater and more enthusiastic expectations of the compatriots across the country, all officers and soldiers of the Air Force are determined to die and charge, bomb, and demand compensation in the rain of blood and iron. According to the numbers that have been confirmed, a total of 848 Japanese aircraft have been shot down, 1,148 Japanese Air Force personnel have been killed, 40 Japanese warships have been sunk, and more than 154 Japanese warships have been damaged, including two aircraft carriers, severely injuring Japanese Air Force personnel, including one Air Force Major General and one Navy Vice Admiral, and dozens of famous figures in the aviation industry. In addition, the millions of leaflets dropped on the expedition to Tokyo are still imprinted in the minds of the Japanese people. These facts are immortal honors in history. Recently, the Japanese concentrated a large number of aircraft in June and July to attack the capital and various undefended cities in Sichuan. This behavior, in addition to consuming oil and bombs (16,574,660 yuan) and losing soldiers (74 people), besides increasing China's determination to build a strong Air Force, it fully gave the Chinese Air Force soldiers even better opportunities to be loyal to the country and filial to the nation and to perform their meritorious deeds. As for the work of building the Air Force, there has been amazing progress in the past three years. At present, the Chinese aviation industry has established a considerable foundation. The training of Air Force cadres is constantly being developed, and aviation national education is also being promoted and implemented. These kinds of facts are enough to prove that the work of building the Chinese Air Force is moving forward bravely. In these three years of the War of Resistance, in terms of combat, the Chinese Air Force has established immortal honors in history, and in terms of building the army, it has established an unshakable foundation. Now, in addition to sincerely and respectfully thanking the President for creating the Air Force and training the Air Force, the enthusiastic contributions of compatriots across the country to the Air Force must not be forgotten. In the past three years, in terms of both manpower and financial resources, compatriots across the country have made their greatest efforts. Millions upon millions of donations, countless comforts, countless comfort items, and thousands upon thousands of young people who have joined the Air Force, and the hardworking airport personnel, these direct and indirect contributions of material and spiritual contributions to help the Air Force in combat and construction will never be forgotten. At present, the great cause of the War of Resistance and national construction has reached the most difficult and arduous stage, and it is also the stage where final victory and success are about to come. The President repeatedly instructed at the closing of the Seventh Plenary Session of the Central Committee that we should always be prepared for the arrival of the most serious and difficult times, because in the cause of revolutionary national construction, the closer it is to the final stage of success, the more difficult and arduous it will inevitably be. The officers and soldiers of the Air Force are abiding by these truths, preparing, and further sharpening their efforts to break through the highly difficult obstacles that will inevitably come with the most tenacious and strong efforts. At the same time, they also feel that the work of expanding the Air Force is more important and urgent. Recalling the great achievements of the national Air Force in combat in the past, which are the results of the construction of the Air Force, and the results of the construction of the Air Force are mostly based on the contributions of compatriots across the country in terms of money and efforts. Therefore, in order to ensure even greater achievements in the future, the work of expanding the construction of the Air Force must be expanded as much as possible. In order to expand the work of expanding the construction of the Air Force as much as possible, we must rely on compatriots across the country to make even greater contributions to the Air Force for the country and the nation. Therefore, on the occasion of the August 14th commemoration, we sincerely request: First, the physique of children and young people across the country should be strengthened, and scientific knowledge should be actively enriched, so as to be suitable for the standards of Air Force personnel in the future; Second, local natural resources should be actively developed, so as to assist in the development of the domestic aircraft manufacturing industry; Third, scientists and industrialists across the country should closely connect, and research and plan to develop China's aviation industry as much as possible; Fourth, national educational and cultural groups and individuals should intensify their efforts to popularize national aviation education; Fifth, and more importantly, compatriots across the country with abundant assets should donate aviation funds for national salvation tenfold more enthusiastically, in order to build a strong Air Force to win the final victory. In addition, we hope that the valuable deeds in the history of the construction of the Chinese Air Force will contribute manpower and financial resources ten times more to build a stronger Chinese Air Force.

### New Tactics of the Japanese Air Force; No Military Value

Chongqing: The Air Defense Command recently announced that when Japanese aircraft attacked Chongqing on Sunday, the Chinese fighter jets shot down five Japanese bombers and damaged six other aircraft. The communiqué stated that this new victory shows that Japan's new tactics have failed to achieve their expected results. It is said that if 81 aircraft attack Chongqing, then Japanese aircraft can avoid attacks by Chinese aircraft. This new tactic of the Japanese is intended to ensure mutual protection between Japanese aircraft and prevent intrusion by Chinese aircraft. Therefore, the flight of Japanese aircraft is often in several batches, and the formation of their columns is three miles wide, and the bombers are flying at an altitude of between 6,500 meters and 7,500 meters to avoid anti-aircraft guns. However, the Japanese aircraft implementing this new tactic cannot concentrate their attacks on any important target or any fixed part of the city. The bombs they drop are scattered everywhere. This kind of bombing has no military value and only harms civilians and property. (United Press, 13th)

### British Troops Stationed in Beiping Withdraw Yesterday; Rumor Says They Will Join Tianjin Troops to Hong Kong

Beiping: A small guard unit from the British Embassy in Beiping, singing war songs, passed through the embassy district and began their journey. This unit consisted of two officers and thirty soldiers. Upon departure, they paid their final respects to the American troops stationed in China. The British troops then proceeded to the train station amidst the music played by the American troops and departed for Tianjin by train. American, French, and other military officers and diplomatic personnel, as well as British officials and citizens, also went to the station to see them off. (United Press dispatch, 13th)

Tianjin: A spokesman for the Japanese army here stated to local newspapers that the British withdrawal of its troops stationed in North China has given the Japanese authorities here a favorable impression. He also said that the United States, France, and Italy should also withdraw their troops to avoid international friction. The spokesman further explained that he was requesting the withdrawal of foreign troops stationed in North China, not the withdrawal of foreign troops stationed in Shanghai. The spokesman continued that the Japanese military believes the British withdrawal is an act of British friendship, which is not only beneficial to China and Japan but also to Britain. The press then asked him to explain the reasons for this statement. The spokesman replied that Britain originally sent troops to China to protect the world from Chinese aggression, but since the Japanese army can maintain order in North China, the British troops are weak and unnecessary. He added that the Japanese believe this move by Britain demonstrates that it trusts the Japanese army's ability to protect foreign interests. The spokesman also stated that Japan has no intention of taking over foreign concessions, but if the British authorities request Japanese assistance to protect the concessions, the Japanese may be willing to extend their assistance. The Japanese will not intervene unless absolutely necessary. This morning at 10:30 AM, British Army Commander Major General Dowling visited the Japanese Garrison Commander Honma to bid farewell, and they talked for forty-five minutes. At 2:30 PM, French Army Commander in China, General Isotti, visited Dowling and talked for one and a half hours. (United Press dispatch, 13th)

Forty of the fifty guards from the British Embassy here left Beiping for Tianjin at 4:10 PM today, carrying all their military equipment. They will join the 120 British troops stationed in Tianjin and depart from Tianjin on August 15th, reportedly heading to Hong Kong. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)

Tianjin: A Japanese military spokesman, in response to questions regarding the British military withdrawal from North China, stated that the Japanese authorities have a favorable impression of the British expression of confidence in Japan's ability to protect foreigners. He believes that other troops should also withdraw from North China to avoid international friction. When asked whether the Japanese army would patrol British areas, the spokesman replied that if the British authorities make such a request, the Japanese would be happy to comply. He also claimed they would not interfere unless circumstances require. British Army Commander Major General Dowling visited Japanese Commander General Honma this morning to bid farewell. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)

Washington: The Washington Daily News stated yesterday that Britain's withdrawal of troops stationed in China "will further lose its interests in the Far East." The newspaper said that although Britain's withdrawal of troops from China to Hong Kong or Singapore will increase the country's military strength, the first point that should not be misunderstood is that this move "directly falls into the Japanese scheme and puts the United States in a difficult situation." (United Press dispatch, 13th)

Tianjin: According to semi-official Japanese sources, regarding rumors that the British planned to hand over the British military patrol area in North China to the American army after the withdrawal of troops, British Army Commander Major Dowling and the British Consul General solemnly denied this when they visited Japanese Army Commander Honma this morning.

### Hong Kong Defense Actively Strengthened

Hong Kong: Hong Kong is now painstakingly strengthening its defenses. As the atmosphere of war grows more urgent, the people of Hong Kong are earnestly paying attention to preparations and want to make Hong Kong a small England. Since the enactment of the military training act, British men who are not of Chinese origin are serving in local defense. Every morning, fully armed volunteers go out for full-day training. These volunteers must receive one day of training per week, and their employers do not make things difficult for them, as the government has the right to prevent employers from interfering. The number of Chinese personnel in the Volunteer Corps has greatly increased in the past few months, and people from Britain's allied countries have also joined the army. Those who perform necessary daily work or are over the age of volunteer soldiers also join the local defense force and receive rifle and machine gun training two nights a week. Therefore, even well-off company managers must be commanded by young soldiers, but everyone is willing to fulfill their responsibilities. The local defense force has also received the enthusiastic service of the volunteer team. The number of police reserves has also greatly increased, with many Chinese joining, volunteering to patrol for six hours a day in addition to their regular work. The other ambulance and women's nursing teams are also active and increasing their training courses. Barbed wire has been placed along the coast where landings are possible, with machine gun nests behind the wire. Defense is being prepared all the way to Kowloon. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)

### Japanese Foreign Minister Discusses the Future of the Far East

Tokyo: When Japanese Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka met with the press recently, he spoke about the future of the Far East, saying that the Japanese government will cooperate with various countries as much as possible to establish a new order in the Far East. The Japanese authorities are now preparing the necessary measures to establish a Far Eastern economic zone after the war and emphasized that the Chinese issue must be resolved early, but not in a compromising manner. The international situation must also be taken into account when resolving it. The result of the European war will inevitably bring about drastic changes in the world economy, so we must wait for the aftermath. (Haitong dispatch, 13th)

### German Air Offensive Becomes Increasingly Fierce; Major Battle Between British and German Air Forces; Eight Hundred Aircraft Fill the Sky; Italian Aircraft Participate for the First Time

London: The largest air battle in history was deadlocked over the English Channel area late yesterday. Eight hundred British and German warplanes participated in the battle, and Italy was participating for the first time. As a result of yesterday's air battle, between forty-five and fifty German aircraft were shot down, and the number of heavily damaged aircraft was about the same. German bombing began at midnight, repeatedly attacking important British targets, including the Portsmouth naval base, merchant ship escort ships, airfields, and important coastal cities. It is widely believed that the nature of this air raid, the large number of German aircraft (estimated at over six hundred), and the attacks that have lasted for more than forty-eight hours all prove that this is the final preparation for the blitzkrieg that Germany has long promoted. More than seventy German bombers attacked a city on the southeastern coast of England at dusk, and other German aircraft flew over various parts of southeastern, northeastern, southwestern, and northwestern England and Wales at midnight. Although British officials admitted that there were some deaths, they were unable to immediately compile statistics. It is reported that although the bombing range was extremely wide and tens of thousands of bombs were dropped, the number of casualties was less than expected. This was the first time that the Italian Air Force participated in the air battle, and it is reported that several Italian Air Force personnel were captured. A British Air Ministry communique stated that nine British fighter planes were missing. The areas that suffered the greatest German attacks were Portsmouth, the Isle of Wight, Kent, and Sussex. (International News Service, 13th)

London: Germany intensified its aerial blitzkrieg against the British Isles yesterday. Four hundred German aircraft invaded Britain yesterday. According to fragmentary news received up to 7:00 PM last night, German aircraft had bombed various towns in the interior of Britain. The number of civilian casualties yesterday was the highest since the outbreak of the war. According to unofficial statistics, there were thirty German aircraft off the southern and southeastern coasts of Britain. Neutral and British experts declare that they have not confirmed that Germany is preparing for a large-scale invasion of Britain. It is also impossible to confirm the rumors in the Balkans that Germany is preparing eight thousand small boats to cross the English Channel to attack Britain, but officials here have confirmed the news that the German army is building several large airfields in northern France. (United Press dispatch, 11th/12th)

London: A major air battle took place in the skies over the southeastern coast this morning. Although many anti-aircraft shells exploded in the clouds, the spraying of machine-gun fire was very obvious. According to an observer at the listening station, enemy aircraft flew in batches every two or three minutes, like waves coming in. Another observer said, "I saw aircraft filling the sky, there were hundreds of them." (Reuters dispatch, 13th)

London: Last night, German aircraft were more active in several parts of England and the skies over Wales than before. Bombs fell in the southeastern, northwestern, and southwestern regions of England. However, many German aircraft flying over the sea hastily retreated when British fighter planes approached. German bombers attacked Wales yesterday morning for several hours. The bombs dropped on coastal towns damaged several houses and caused some deaths and injuries. Enemy aircraft were repeatedly driven away by anti-aircraft fire. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)

Berlin: After the German Air Force began its intensified invasion of England on Sunday, it continued to carry out a terrible aerial attack yesterday. Sources close to German officials warned that this air raid "is just beginning." They said, "This air raid will continue or even become more terrible day by day." The Germans refused to state whether this air raid was the beginning of a "major invasion" of England. The German official news agency stated that Sunday's air raid on England was "the first step in Germany's air superiority." The news agency quoted military experts as saying that the attacks by German aircraft in the past two days have shown that Britain is unable to maintain its strong combat defense line along the coast. "This is the first sign of the collapse of British resistance." (United Press dispatch, 13th)

Sixty-One German Aircraft Shot Down by the British

London: Official sources state that a total of sixty-one German aircraft were shot down during yesterday's air raid on the coast. The British lost thirteen fighter planes, one of whose pilots was rescued safely. According to brief reports, at least ten German aircraft were shot down in today's air raid. German aircraft fiercely attacked barrage balloons in a coastal city in the southeast, and two of them caught fire and fell. In a certain air battle, British Spitfire planes chased eight Junkers bombers and shot down two of them. Another one caught fire in a city on the southeast coast, destroying four houses. There were very few casualties. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)

German Communique Claims 92 British Aircraft Destroyed

Berlin: This afternoon, the German military report stated that yesterday, the German Air Force attacked naval ports and airfields on the southeastern and southern coasts of England. Many bombs hit the Portsmouth naval base. The local power plant and the Thorquay shipyard caught fire. Many docks, piers, and patrol ships in the English Channel were hit. The air battle was extremely fierce, and as many as forty-three enemy aircraft were shot down. Airfields and aircraft factories in Manston, Canterbury, Hawkinge, and Lympe caught fire. In Manston, four British aircraft parked on the ground were destroyed, and another three were shot down during reconnaissance. Elsewhere, eight aircraft parked on the ground were also bombed. German aircraft also burned down two "barrage balloons" in Dover. As a result of this air battle, thirty enemy aircraft were shot down. German dive bombers attacked and bombed British convoys, sinking two merchant ships and setting another ship on fire. Last night, German bombers attacked ships and anti-aircraft gun emplacements in the Ouse and Cardiff. British aircraft dropped bombs in northern and western Germany last night, but did not cause significant losses to the German side. German anti-aircraft guns shot down four British aircraft. In total, ninety-two enemy aircraft were lost yesterday, of which twelve were destroyed on the ground, four were shot down by anti-aircraft guns, and the rest were destroyed in air combat. Twenty-four German aircraft are missing. (Haitong dispatch, 13th)

British Isles Heavily Bombed

London: Officials announced that the German aircraft shot down in the coastal air battles around Britain yesterday, as far as is known so far, numbered thirty-nine. Nine British warplanes are also missing. Yesterday evening, after hearing explosions in the distance from a town on the southern coast, about twenty Spitfire British warplanes and Messerschmitt German planes were seen fighting in the town of Goden. At least one German aircraft was shot down. After a burst of gunfire, another German aircraft was seen wobbling and falling, landing in a vegetable field. The pilot has been found and injured. Moments later, from where the gunfire came, another German aircraft was seen falling. The pilot jumped out with a parachute and fell into the sea with the aircraft. The pilot was rescued by a lifeboat. Yesterday, another German aircraft crew member, fighting in southeastern England, suffered a severe leg injury. He landed with a parachute and was captured by farmers armed with guns and taken to the police station. Another German crew member jumped out and drowned in the sea. Someone driving a car saw a wounded German crew member landing and used a pistol to capture the crew member, took him home, and then handed him over to the police station. A joint communique from the Admiralty, the Air Force, the Ministry of Internal Security stated that German aircraft attacked England this morning, first bombing coastal areas of Exmouth, then a large number of German aircraft attacked the Isle of Wight and Portsmouth. A certain shipyard was attacked, and two docks and two harbor small boats were sunk. The Portsmouth train station was hit, and several buildings, including a brewery, were set on fire. Although German aircraft dropped many bombs, casualties were not heavy. A church and several civilian houses on the Isle of Wight were damaged, injuring several people. Reports have been received about the attacks on the coasts of Kent and Sussex. It is learned that several locations were bombed, and several British airfields were slightly damaged. Civilian houses were also hit, but casualties were very light. Enemy aircraft were fiercely attacked by British defense forces everywhere and suffered heavy damage. British defense force casualties were light. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)

Germany Finds it Difficult to Gain Air Supremacy

London: A Reuters Air Force correspondent stated that the British Royal Air Force admits that the German air raids that began on Thursday have not yet reached the blitzkrieg tactics that Germany can use. The enemy aircraft formations that came during the day did not seem to exceed two hundred. It is estimated that the total number of German aircraft participating in the battle yesterday had increased to five hundred. Although the German Air Force is currently suffering heavy losses and the production of aircraft is hindered by British air raids, it still has a large number of aircraft available. It is now believed that Germany can dispatch a thousand aircraft a day to fight for air supremacy. However, after the British fighters repeatedly achieved great victories, Germany may find that this number is not enough to achieve its goal. The German aircraft's group air raids have so far been limited to the southeastern and southern coasts. The targets chosen by German bombers are limited to the effective range of activities of protecting fighters. If bombers fly in large numbers beyond this semi-circular diameter during the day, they will encounter very heavy blows. Even within this semi-circular diameter, the combat capability of British fighters is still incomparable to that of enemy fighters. Although the German new-type Heinkel 113 is faster than the Messerschmitt 110 or 109, it is still far inferior to the British Spitfire. It seems too early to say whether Germany intends to invade after the current large-scale air raids. Since the collapse of France, Germany has lost as many as 500 aircraft in air raids on England. Regarding the sea and air victories promoted by Germany, the responsible authorities here issued the following criticism. According to London, when the German General Headquarters reported on the air battles on Thursday, Sunday, and Monday, they admitted that German aircraft had only lost 55 aircraft, but the actual number was 187. The Germans claimed to have destroyed 234 British aircraft, but in reality, only 55 were destroyed. The Germans' false reports can be seen from this. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)

British Aircraft Carry Out Daily Air Raids on German Territory

The Air Ministry announced that on Saturday night, British bombers again attacked German military targets, including oil factories and power stations in Schöningen and other places. On Sunday, British medium-sized bombers attacked the Guise Island flying port and other airfields during the day, dropping bombs accurately, causing many fires and explosions. A coastal aircraft shot down a German fighter plane patrolling the French coast, which crashed into the sea. On Sunday, British aircraft carried out a large-scale attack, losing only three aircraft. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)

Britain Uses New Air Combat Weapons

London: Britain is currently processing and manufacturing a new type of cannon for the Royal Air Force to use. It is said that this weapon is superior in speed to those used by the German Air Force. As for its style, range, and rate of fire, the authorities naturally keep it secret. British aircraft are now equipped with at least one type of cannon, but as far as warplanes are concerned, the British Air Force still prefers the Browning machine gun network. This machine gun network has a total of eight guns, four on each wing, which fire armor-piercing rounds and tracer rounds at a rate of 160 rounds per second. According to experts, firing this type of machine gun in a three-second burst creates a deadly fire net. When enemy and enemy aircraft gradually approach each other at a rate of more than 12 miles per minute, shooting must be rapid and accurate. Therefore, pilots of British Hurricane and Spitfire aircraft wait until enemy aircraft are close before firing. Because the range is short, the concentrated and flowing bullets penetrate the steel armor, as if piercing a piece of butter. The cannons used by the German Air Force, according to British experts, have not reached perfection since the beginning of the war. The German cannon is the Madsen 20mm, which fires shells weighing three-tenths of a pound at a rate of four per second. German Messerschmitt aircraft are still testing it. The range of the Madsen cannon is 600 yards, which is better than the Browning machine gun, but because the shooting is not accurate, the advantages and disadvantages offset each other. As for Britain's new cannon, the Air Ministry began experimenting with it in 1920. After twenty years of research, the current results have been achieved. (International News Service dispatch, 13th)

### Australian Plane Crash; Australian Army Chief of Staff Dies

Australia: A Canberra aircraft, after circling the airfield twice, suddenly disappeared behind a mountain. It was later learned that it had crashed eight miles away. It is now believed that the passengers included Army Chief of Staff General Cyril and one Army Colonel. The aircraft has been completely destroyed. Armed guards are stationed around the wreckage. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)

Stockholm: A tragic plane crash occurred in an airfield near Canberra, Australia, killing ten people. Australian Minister of the Army Street, Minister of Aviation Fairbairn, Chief of Staff Sir White, and others were killed. The giant aircraft they were riding in crashed into trees while making a forced landing, causing an explosion and immediate fire. The cause of the accident is currently under investigation.

### Unrest in Albania Continues; Locals and Italian Troops Engage in Fierce Battles; Southern Government Says It Has Not Heard Anything

London: According to a Reuter's dispatch from Zurich last night, as a result of the fierce battle between Italian troops and Albanian locals, more than 400 people were killed and injured. It is reported that the most fierce battles are currently taking place in northern Albania. The Italian authorities are now unable to resist the rebels' riot, so the rebellion is developing vigorously. (International News dispatch, 13th)

Southern Capital: Officials here have not yet received reports of border clashes between Greece and Albania. On the contrary, the claim that a rebellion broke out among the Mirdites in northern Albania near Skadar has been officially denied. It is said that traffic between Yugoslavia and northern Albania is still normal, and Yugoslav ships are still traveling to and from various ports in Skadar, northern Albania. (Haitong dispatch, 13th)

### Italian-Greek Discord; Italian Questions Greek Protests Regarding the Assassination of Hoggia

Athens: Officials here yesterday denied the Italian claim that Albanian patriot Hoggia was assassinated by Greeks near the Greek-Albanian border. According to Greek documents, Hoggia was a well-known bandit, not a patriot, and he was killed by two Albanians two months ago. After the assassination, they crossed the border into Greek territory and were subsequently arrested. The Italian Embassy in Greece issued a note to the Greek Foreign Minister on July 25 stating that the Albanian Minister of Justice would soon formally request the Greek government to extradite them, but the Greek government has not yet received this request. It has been found that Hoggia committed repeated crimes twenty years ago. As for the Italian claims that the murderers carried Hoggia's head to show it in various villages, they are all untrue. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)

Rome: According to authoritative sources here last night, Italy will protest to Greece regarding the assassination of Hoggia, who advocated for the return of lost territories in Albania, by Greeks in Albanian territory. The Rome People's Daily said in an afternoon edition when discussing Hoggia's assassination, condemned Greece for undermining its neutral status and openly assisting Britain by providing gasoline to its aircraft and warships in Greece. It is reported that after Hoggia was assassinated by the Greeks, his body was transported across the Albanian border into Greece in hopes of receiving a reward because the Greek government had offered a reward for Hoggia's head. The Italian news agency Stefani stated that Hoggia advocated that Greece should return the Ciamuria province, which it annexed in 1913, to Albania. The news agency condemned Hoggia's attempt to place the province in a stateless situation. This evening, newspapers here continued to pay attention to this incident, saying that this was clear evidence of Greek aggression. The headline of the Italian Daily was "Greece's Oppression of the Entire Ciamuria Region." Other newspapers' headlines and reports all called Hoggia an "old patriot and an extraordinary promoter of Ciamuria's freedom." (United Press dispatch, 13th)

### Joint Declaration by Greek Military Officers

### Tunis: Anti-Italian Riot

Milan: According to yesterday's "Corriere della Sera," an anti-Italian riot occurred in Tunis. Italians wearing Fascist uniforms, accompanied by their wives and daughters, were walking in the street when they were suddenly subjected to violence by the French.

### Railway Negotiations Between Finland and the Soviet Union

Helsinki: The first round of railway negotiations between Finland and the Soviet Union concluded yesterday in Moscow. Draft agreements on through traffic between Finland and the Soviet Union and on connecting the Hanko railway were prepared. It was decided that the negotiations would continue shortly. It is reported that the Finnish side has largely completed preparations for various technical aspects of through traffic with the Soviet Union. It is also learned that the instruments of ratification for the commercial agreement concluded between Finland and the Soviet Union in early July were exchanged here yesterday. Both sides expressed their efforts to promote trade between the two countries. (Haitong Telegraph, 13th)

### Significant Reform of the Soviet Red Army System

Moscow: In view of the fact that the People's Commissar for Political Affairs of the Red Army has completed its basic work, and that the number of cadres in the Red Army and Navy has also increased in recent years, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union has made the following decisions in order to unify command and organization, enhance the prestige of the military, and ensure the complete political training of command personnel:

(1) Abolish the legal system of political commissars in the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army (this system was approved by the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet People's Commissariat on August 15, 1937).

(2) Establish deputy commanders for political affairs in each division, brigade, military school, and Red Army naval unit.

(3) The military councils of each district, front line, and army group shall be fully responsible for political work in each army, division, and brigade. (TASS Dispatch, 13th)

### Former British Secretary of State for War Advocates Training an Army of 100 Divisions to Invade Continental Europe for Ultimate Victory

London: Former Secretary of State for War Hore-Belisha, in a speech in Tamworth last night, advocated training an army of several million men, saying that Britain must plan to invade enemy-occupied territory, otherwise we will not be able to achieve ultimate victory. Therefore, preparations should be made to train an army of at least 100 divisions, equipped with the best recent combat experience and attached aviation units. Currently, British industrial mobilization has not yet reached a complete state. This situation cannot be allowed to continue for long, because the 800,000 unemployed in the country will not be able to defeat Germany. The task of the British economy is to mobilize all productive capacity and fully utilize it. The production of goods for pure consumption should be reduced as much as possible to meet the essential needs of the people. Export trade should be encouraged as much as possible to pay for Britain's necessary imports. The remaining industries should be devoted day and night to the production of war materials. (Reuters Dispatch, 13th)

### General de Gaulle's Broadcast Address

London: General de Gaulle, head of the French National Committee in Britain, broadcast to the world last night, saying that when France was misled and surrendered by the Vichyites, it still possessed strong combat instruments. It was the enemy's cunning schemes and the lies of collaborators that ultimately led France to sign a shameful armistice. However, the weeks following the armistice have been sufficient to show the guilt of those who advocated surrender at the time. When France laid down its arms, it still had the entire navy, second in Europe, a great air force, and vast colonies. Britain was also actively engaged in the army, navy, and air force, and the United States was undertaking to support the Allied countries with its powerful arms manufacturing capacity. All of this is the opposite of what the moribund Vichyites said. Now it can be seen that what the Germans want is to destroy France in both material and spiritual terms, so that they can more easily enslave the French. France can have no hope for the enemies who hate France and the old men who betray France. Therefore, the path we are now taking is the right one, without a doubt. Nothing is more gratifying to us than this. (Reuters Dispatch, 13th)

### The British Admiralty Announces Merchant Ship Losses; Actual Number is Only Over 70,000 Tons

London: German propaganda claims that in the week ending August 5, Britain lost a total of 232,743 tons of merchant shipping.

### Uruguayan Nazi Leader Fuhrmann Arrested; Known as the "Head of South America"

New York: The New York Times' dispatch from Buenos Aires reports that the so-called "Head of South America," Fuhrmann, was arrested on Sunday night in Concordia, on the Uruguayan bank of the Uruguay River, on the border between Argentina and Uruguay. This arrest was requested by the Buenos Aires police department. It is expected that the Argentine government will order his expulsion. Previously, the Argentine government had identified the German national Arnhold as an important member of the German secret police and ordered his deportation. Earlier, a Uruguayan parliamentary committee investigating Nazi activities seized documents from Fuhrmann's residence detailing Germany's plan to seize Uruguay by force and make it a colony. Fuhrmann admitted that he had drafted the plan, but said it was only a joke. Although the German ambassador to Uruguay issued a statement disavowing it and saying that Fuhrmann was a mentally unsound Argentine citizen and should not be taken seriously, letters seized by the Uruguayan police proved that Fuhrmann was one of the most powerful Nazi leaders in Uruguay, and frequently communicated with Nazi leaders in Germany. (Reuters Dispatch, 13th)

### Italian Newspaper Attacks the Pétain Government, Accusing it of Deceiving the Axis Powers

Rome: The "Fascist Regime" newspaper, controlled by Farinacci, attacked French Premier Pétain and Deputy Premier Laval yesterday, saying that the two intended to make the Vichy government superficially close to the totalitarian regime in order to deceive the Axis powers. The newspaper commented on a recent editorial published in the widely circulated French weekly "Marianne," saying, "The French in the German-occupied zone are now looking forward with unease, because a few 'self-styled' individuals are again poisoning public opinion. This clever phenomenon can be found in the areas ruled by Marshal Pétain and Laval. Furthermore, the resumption of the popular French weekly 'Marianne' can also be seen as evidence. The first editorial of the weekly after the signing of the armistice adopted an anti-totalitarian stance, and said that this attitude would become the general trend in France." The "Fascist Regime" newspaper cited the editorial of the weekly "Marianne" as proof, which accused the French people of not abandoning traditional "social democracy" and declared this a cowardly act. The Italian newspaper said, "If anyone can remember that there is still a strict censorship system in France, then he must admit that the remarks published by the weekly 'Marianne' are indeed crucial. We believe that after a few months, un-occupied France will have the possibility of returning to a Judaized and 'Masonic' political system. At this point, our suspicions about the Vichy government will be correct. In fact, the tone of the weekly 'Marianne' is indeed very accurate, because no one can change the minds of 40 million French people in 45 hours. Laval knows this very well, but he hopes that the Pétain government can use this to deceive the Axis countries, but the result is that the hope is very slim." (United Press)

### Romanian-Bulgarian Preparatory Negotiations Encounter New Complications; Romania Accepts the Hungarian Memorandum; Negotiations Between the Two Countries Are About to Begin

Sofia: Well-informed sources here announced last night that the preparatory negotiations between Bulgaria and Romania are now being delayed. King Carol received the Romanian special envoy Catargi. Romanian Minister to Bulgaria Filloti met with Bulgarian Foreign Minister Popov on the 10th, delivered the reply to the Bulgarian memorandum, and expressed the Romanian government's willingness in principle to cede Southern Dobruja, but requested that the city of Silistra on the Danube River and the port of Balchik on the Black Sea remain within Romanian territory. It is said that the Bulgarian government replied that it could not accept this counter-proposal, considering it inconsistent with Bulgaria's moderate demands. Therefore, the planned direct negotiations will not begin as scheduled. Before receiving a new reply from Romania, the Bulgarian delegation will not depart for the time being. At the same time, the proposal to convene a special session of the Bulgarian parliament will also be postponed. (Haitong Telegraph, 13th)

Budapest: According to an official announcement here, Romania accepted Hungary's memorandum on the issue of territorial cession on the 9th of this month. A Hungarian-Romanian conference will be held in Romania in the near future. The Hungarian delegation will be led by Horthy. (Haitong Agency, 13th)

Bulgaria Receives Strong Support from the Soviet Union for the Return of Southern Dobruja

Moscow: Regarding the issue of the return of Southern Dobruja to Bulgaria, Izvestia and Pravda both published articles saying, "European newspapers are now paying attention to Bulgarian-Romanian relations, especially regarding the issue of Southern Dobruja, which originally belonged to Bulgaria but was later seized. It is said that the Bulgarian side is demanding the return of Dobruja very urgently, and has submitted a formal request to the Romanian government, that is, if the entire Dobruja cannot be returned to the Bulgarian side, at a minimum, the southern part of the region must be returned to its original owner. According to Bulgarian official statistics, Bulgarians account for the majority of the population of Southern Dobruja. Romanians in the region account for only two percent. Bulgarian public opinion generally believes that Southern Dobruja must belong to Bulgaria. This has been explained by the materials published by the press section of the Bulgarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In the seventh century, Dobruja belonged to Bulgaria. In 1878, it was under Turkish control, but according to the Treaty of San Stefano on March 3 of the same year, Northern Dobruja was merged into Romania. In 1913, Romania further took advantage of Bulgaria's weakness after the Second Balkan War to occupy Southern Dobruja. On August 10 of the same year, Bulgaria and Romania signed an agreement in Sofia, formally merging Southern Dobruja into Romania. In 1916, during the First Imperialist War, the Bulgarian army assisted the German-Austrian allied forces in the war and occupied Southern Dobruja. According to the German-Romanian Treaty of 1918, Southern Dobruja should be returned to Bulgaria immediately. However, finally, according to the Treaty of Neuilly on November 27, 1919, the Bulgarian-Romanian border remained unchanged and there were no changes. After the First Imperialist War, the Romanian authorities tried their best to Romanianize Southern Dobruja. In 1924, the Romanian authorities enacted a law declaring the confiscation of one-third of the land in Southern Dobruja, to be reserved for Romanian immigrants. At that time, the Bulgarian people in the area unanimously expressed their opposition. The Romanian authorities then used military force to suppress the people, and even established military assassination squads in the village of Senovo. The result of this Romanianization effort has led most farmers to leave Southern Dobruja. In view of the above facts, Bulgaria's demand for the return of Southern Dobruja must be considered extremely fair. The Soviet Union will continue to maintain its attitude of supporting the Bulgarian demand." (TASS Dispatch, 13th)

Sofia: After Bulgarian Minister to the Soviet Union Stamenov returned here on the 10th of this month, Bulgarian Minister to Turkey Schwarkilov also returned home yesterday to report important events to the government. Well-informed sources here claim that the Turkish government has formally expressed its willingness to recognize Bulgaria's demand for Southern Dobruja. (Haitong Telegraph, 13th)

German Army Captures 150,000 Warhorses

Berlin: According to well-informed sources, the German army captured a total of 150,000 warhorses during the war. In the Battle of Kutno in Poland, 20,000 horses were captured, in the Battle of Dunkirk, 30,000, and in the Battle of France, 100,000. The value of these horses is 120 million marks. The German army's horse losses were 1.3 percent in Poland and 1 percent in the first phase of the Western Campaign. (Haitong Telegraph, 13th)

### Germany's Torpedo Boats

Haitong News Agency Dispatch: After German Führer and Supreme Commander of the Army, Navy, and Air Force Adolf Hitler accepted the request of Grand Admiral Raeder, Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, and awarded the Iron Cross to Captain Paul, commander of the torpedo boat flotilla, the public has paid attention to the torpedo boats, which have recently achieved many remarkable feats. These torpedo boats sank a Norwegian torpedo boat during the Norwegian campaign and escorted ships transporting troops and supplies to Norway. In the recent seven attacks on the British coast, they sank four British destroyers, as well as many merchant ships, transport ships, and oil tankers. Torpedo boats are small and fast ships, agile in action, and carry very few sailors. If there are losses, they are easy to replenish. Moreover, the ship's body is very small, and it is not easy for the enemy to detect them at night. They can approach large ships and attack them. Therefore, the principle of torpedo boats is "small sacrifice, large harvest." As the speed of various warships gradually increases, torpedo boats have had to slightly increase their tonnage in order to increase their speed. During combat, they also adopt a concentrated firing formation from a greater distance. Their mission is still to attack enemy destroyers and torpedo boats, pursue submarines, undertake reconnaissance work, lay mines near enemy coasts, and protect merchant ships and transport ships. During the last World War, an Italian torpedo boat hid next to a small island in the Adriatic Sea on a foggy morning and suddenly destroyed a new type of battleship of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Navies of various countries began to pay attention to the effectiveness of torpedo boats. The Mediterranean Sea only requires smaller torpedo boats, while the North Sea and the Baltic Sea have larger winds and waves. Germany has built larger torpedo boats. The tactics of new torpedo boats are to approach enemy ships at a slower speed, and after being detected and releasing torpedoes, to escape at the highest speed and take a tortuous route to make it difficult for enemy ships to aim and fire. The English Channel has very small winds and waves, and the narrowest part between Dover and Calais, outside the mouth of the Thames River, is often where torpedo boats achieve success. The English Channel has many beaches, and large ships must take prescribed routes. Therefore, after attacking enemy ships, torpedo boats can travel between the beaches without fear of pursuit by enemy ships. During the war against Britain, torpedo boats will achieve even greater feats.

### The August 13th Anniversary Passed Silently; Citizens' Morale is Even More Inspired; Calm Self-Awareness Engaged in Local Efforts; Steadfast Belief Welcoming Unlimited Brightness; Special Alert Expected to be Lifted This Morning

Yesterday was the third anniversary of the Songhu Anti-Japanese War. The whole city passed it peacefully in a solemn and respectful state. Recalling the rapid changes in the world over the past three years, the commemorative situation for this glorious and brilliant day of national resistance has also been different each year. This situation is due, on the one hand, to the daily decline of the concession environment, and on the other hand, to the fact that the majority of Chinese people have accumulated three years of great and arduous experience. Their belief in victory is even more steadfast, and their concept of resistance has shifted from superficial enthusiasm to inner calmness. Temporary excitement is easily replaced by long-term perseverance. At this time and in this place, all those who are even slightly self-aware are calm and silent, working hard and diligently, seeking to contribute to the work of resistance and construction. Yesterday, the Chinese in this city also knew how to restrain their emotions, act with reason and knowledge, and conduct a silent and solemn spiritual memorial ceremony, donating money to help the victims and collecting winter clothes, each contributing their ability and doing their best. Chinese-operated amusement parks, cinemas, and other commercial institutions all stopped business. At 12 noon, all public and private groups, institutions, and most families, under the leadership of the host or head of the family, stood in silence for three minutes to mourn and pay tribute to the loyal souls of the martyrs who sacrificed in the war of resistance, and also to swear to persevere to the end and strive for victory. The details are recorded separately as follows:

Strict Alert, No Incidents Occurred

The special alert jointly implemented by the police authorities of the two concessions in recent days reached its most stringent level yesterday. To strengthen police efficiency, all mobilized police personnel in the two concessions increased the number of guards stationed at the gaps in various roads yesterday, and intensified the inspection of pedestrians and vehicles. Patrols were also very active everywhere. In addition, the two concessions had mobile teams of seven or eight patrolmen who cruised the important roads, at any time ordering buses and other vehicles to stop and conducting the most stringent searches. The police officers stationed at the barbed wire fences blocking various roads were increased to two yesterday. Armored vehicles and security vehicles traveled everywhere all day long, strengthening the defensive power of various strongholds. As for the iron gates of the French Concession adjacent to Nanshi, they remained open as usual yesterday, but the number of pedestrians entering and exiting has decreased. Thanks to the full-day strict alert by the two concessions, yesterday was fortunately passed peacefully. If there are no unexpected events today, this special alert can be lifted at 8:00 a.m. this morning.

Defense Army Patrolling, Spirits Radiant

The defense forces of various countries stationed in Shanghai also exerted their maximum strength yesterday to assist the concession authorities in maintaining order. The defense forces of the United States, Italy, and France patrolled their respective defense zones all day long. Although the British defense forces are about to withdraw and are eager to prepare, they seemed to make an effort yesterday to carry out alert work in their defense zone. They were in a tense mood and did not slacken all day long. At the time of their final farewell, they gave the people of Shanghai a good impression. As for the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, since Company A was dispatched yesterday, all members have been fully mobilized and assigned to various districts to carry out alert work. As for the White Russian Detachment of the Corps, which is now under the control of the police department, it patrols the area from Yuqiaqing Road to the Bund from time to time. All mobilized defense forces and volunteer corps, unless there are special needs, will also be fully demobilized and restored to their previous state this morning.

### 工部局 Urges Citizens to Stay Home

The Shanghai Municipal Council issued a notice yesterday stating: "During this period of heightened security, the duties of the police and defense forces are extremely heavy. Furthermore, there are many who violate the curfew regulations, which further increases the burden of work. It is hoped that all citizens, during this period of heightened security, will remain indoors every day from midnight (12:00 AM) to 5:00 AM the following morning, so that the majority of police officers responsible for enforcing the curfew can be reassigned to other more important tasks."

Hongkou and Zhabei: Bleak Circumstances

Yesterday, Hongkou also remained under strict security throughout the day. Japanese military police teams of three to five patrolled various locations from time to time. Japanese soldiers were stationed at key points, heavily armed and ready for battle. Some Japanese shops displayed Japanese flags. However, most Chinese people, due to the special circumstances, remained silent in remembrance and expressed their feelings through practical actions, staying home as much as possible. As a result, the Hongkou district became deserted and the situation was extremely bleak. In Zhabei, near the "Municipal Government" and the North Railway Station, Japanese and puppet troops and police were heavily deployed, conducting thorough inspections, creating a sense of extreme unease. The once bustling areas around Baoshan Road and Qujiang Road are now reduced to ashes, overgrown with weeds. Only the barking of stray dogs punctuates this desolate and lifeless landscape. Recalling the situation before the Shanghai Battle, one cannot help but feel deeply saddened.

Most Riverside Piers Closed

Security along the Huangpu River is also very tight. All piers along the Bund, except for the Customs, New Customs, Roosevelt, and a few others, have been closed and sealed off. The piers that remain open are heavily guarded by the Shanghai Volunteer Corps and police. At the upstream of the Huangpu River and west of Suzhou Creek, the number of Japanese and puppet troops and police has also been increased to more than ten, and inspections of those coming ashore are extremely strict. Although traffic on the Huangpu River was not completely blocked yesterday, many people were wary and fearful, resulting in only a few small boats floating on the river, while other ships were nowhere to be seen, a desolate scene resembling a blockade. As for the bridges over Suzhou Creek and the northern district of Suzhou Creek, in addition to the British and Japanese defense forces maintaining strict security, the order was generally peaceful yesterday, and the entire day was able to pass without incident.

Curfew Restrictions Continue

From 6:30 AM to 7:30 AM yesterday morning, a Japanese military unit conducted a simulated battle in the Hongkou district. The sounds of explosions and machine guns were heard in succession, clearly audible in the western part of Shanghai. Most residents who had not been informed beforehand were awakened from their dreams and inquired about what was happening. After understanding the truth, they simply laughed it off. Curfew regulations are still strictly enforced. Regardless of whether they are Chinese or foreign citizens, anyone walking on the streets after 12:30 AM is taken to the police station and released at 5:00 AM the next morning. Yesterday, entertainment venues in the British and French Concessions of Shanghai were closed for the day in accordance with the authorities' orders. However, the nightlife venues in the "outer-limits" area of western Shanghai remained as noisy as usual. The special martial law measures during the third week anniversary of the Battle of Shanghai will be lifted this morning, but curfew restrictions will continue to be strictly enforced.

Various Markets Reopen Today

Shanghai's various trading markets were ordered to temporarily close on the anniversary of the Battle of Shanghai to prevent unfortunate incidents from occurring. A New Voice News Agency reporter inquired about the situation from various markets yesterday: (1) The Shanghai Rice and Tea Association market on the third floor of the Qinglian Pavilion at the corner of Fuzhou Road and Daxin Street, and the Grain, Oil, and Cake Trading Market on the second floor of 15 Edward Road, have both announced that they will be closed for "August 13th Anniversary" and will resume business as usual from the 14th. (2) The Securities Dark Market inside the Hankou Road Stock Exchange has been closed for one and a half days since the afternoon of the 12th and will resume auction from the 14th. (3) The Yarn and Flower Dark Market at Tonghe Guli on Ningbo Road has been temporarily closed for two days since the 12th and will resume trading from the 14th. (4) The Gold Dark Market was closed for one day due to the "August 13th Anniversary" through a public resolution. Due to settlement matters, a special exception was made to close the market in the afternoon of the 12th, so the gold market at the corner of Jiangxi Road and Renji Road will resume business from the 14th.

### Unrest in the Far East, Increased Insurance Premiums, London Has Already Notified

Due to the unstable situation in the Far East, according to news from the insurance industry in Shanghai, the accidental and war risk insurance rates for maritime transport in the Far East are subject to London's instructions. However, the insurance industry in Shanghai has recently received a notice from London that insurance premiums for voyages to various ports in China, Japan, Hong Kong, and the Philippines have been increased across the board. The insurance rates depend on the situation in each location and are not uniform, but the percentage increase is between 30% and 50%.

### Shenhua Ship Robbed at Sea in Fujian, Three Days and Nights of Piracy, Passengers Kidnapped, Over One Million Yuan Stolen

Since the Japanese Navy announced the blockade of the Zhejiang and Fujian coast, shipping has gradually ceased. However, Sanjiangkou in Fujian is still open for customs clearance. The British-owned Yilong Company, Fusheng Company, and the American-owned Weili Han manager Xin'an Na and other companies' ships are operating as usual. The Yilong Company's Shenhua ship, with a carrying capacity of about 3,000 tons, loaded a large amount of flour (more than 30,000 bags), hundreds of pieces of cotton yarn and foreign cloth, and a full complement of passengers from Shanghai on the morning of the 3rd of this month, heading to Sanjiangkou. At 11:00 AM on the 6th, it arrived outside Hanjiangkou North and saw Japanese warships anchored, so it continued to sail north.

Hanjiangkou North: Pirate Lair

At around 5:00 PM that afternoon, it anchored at a small port about 20 miles north of Hanjiangkou. The passengers on board were all local people from Quanzhou, so they were very familiar with the local situation. Seeing the Shenhua ship anchoring, the passengers immediately asked the captain to weigh anchor and move to another location, explaining that pirates were entrenched in the area and that anchoring was extremely dangerous. The captain (British) refused. After a while, five wooden motorboats were seen coming out of the port. The passengers panicked temporarily, but fortunately, the five motorboats left immediately, and things calmed down. The Shenhua ship then anchored there for the night. The next morning (the 7th), the Xin'an Na and Yongfeng ships were seen sailing north. The captain saw this and immediately weighed anchor and followed the two ships north.

Unable to Enter Port: Encountered Misfortune

However, there were Japanese warships stationed along the way, making it impossible to enter nearby ports. In the afternoon, the Shenhua ship still sailed back to the small port outside the sea where it had anchored the previous day. The passengers expressed their dissatisfaction, but the captain insisted on staying. On the morning of the 8th, another wooden motorboat sailed out of the port, flying a certain country's flag, carrying more than 50 soldiers, fully armed. When the passengers saw the motorboat sailing out, they asked the captain to weigh anchor and avoid it, but the captain still refused. Unexpectedly, the motorboat sailed straight towards them, and the captain realized that they had encountered misfortune, but it was too late. The pirates successively jumped onto the deck, took control of the pilot platform and the radio room, and ordered the crew and passengers not to move, then drove them into the cabins and began to loot.

Dense Pirate Boats: Unloading Cargo Daily

They loaded all the crew and passengers' luggage onto the motorboats and forced the crew and passengers onto the deck, searching and robbing everyone of the cash and jewelry they had with them. After the robbery was completed, they forced the captain to sail into the port. The place was surrounded by islands, with a port in the middle. After entering the port and anchoring, the pirate boat sounded its horn, and four or five barges came over. The pirates then opened the hatches and unloaded the cargo from the cabins onto the barges, ordering the crew to help with the unloading. The crew did not dare to refuse. In the evening, the pirates mistakenly identified the radio operator and the second driver as compradors. At the same time, several Jewish passengers were taken away. After questioning the radio operator and the second driver, the pirates realized that they were not compradors and released them back to the ship at dawn. The pirates then inquired about the location of the comprador. Fortunately, he was hidden very well at the time and was not taken away. Later, because the pirate barges were full, they ordered the ship to sail out of the port again to continue unloading cargo.

Japanese Warship Approached: Left Calmly

On the morning of the 10th, the Japanese warship Izumo anchored nearby and sent a motorboat over. The pirates saw it, got off the ship, and left, but without any panic. After the Japanese warship's motorboat docked, Japanese officers and soldiers boarded the ship, briefly inquired about the robbery situation, and took away five or six pirates who had been left behind, ordering the Shenhua ship to leave. They immediately weighed anchor. The captain initially planned to sail back to Shanghai, but after suffering this robbery, the passengers had no money left to maintain themselves in Shanghai, so they asked the captain to sail to a nearby port so that they could disembark. Therefore, they sailed south towards Hanjiangkou. However, because there were Japanese warships in every port, they could not anchor, so they decided to sail back to Shanghai on Saturday morning.

Returned to Shanghai in Distress: Robbed Clean

They arrived in Shanghai at 8:00 PM the day before yesterday (the 12th) and docked at the Longmao Warehouse pier in Pudong. The ship had been hijacked for three days, and three-quarters of the cargo had been robbed. The luggage and belongings of the passengers and crew, as well as the cash and jewelry they had with them, were all stolen. Several Jewish passengers were kidnapped and their whereabouts are unknown. The estimated loss is more than one million yuan. The captain, chief mate, comprador, and others of the ship have drafted a report and reported it to the company. The company will forward the report to the British Consulate in the coming days. As for the passengers who arrived in Shanghai, because they were penniless and unable to disembark, some were visited by relatives and friends, while others remained on board, waiting for the aftermath to be dealt with.

### Japan Expands Blockade, Eight Coastal Ports, Shanghai-Fujian Shipping Inevitably Cut Off Completely, Foreign Ships Will Return to Shanghai and Cease Operations

Since the Japanese Navy announced the blockade of the coasts of Zhejiang and Fujian on the 26th of last month, including the coasts of Wenzhou, Zhenhai, Fuzhou, Hanjiang, and Sazuo Ao, a month has passed in an instant. Yesterday, according to a reporter from Daguang News Agency who inquired from the shipping industry, the Japanese side has continued to announce that it will expand the blockade of the coasts of Fujian and Zhejiang from the 15th of this month. The details are as follows:

Blocked Ports

The shipping industry learned that the Japanese Navy suddenly notified the consulates of various countries yesterday, informing the shipping companies that, starting from the 15th of this month, the blockade of Fujian and Zhejiang will be expanded, prohibiting ships from traveling to the following ports: (1) Haiping, (2) Zha Yong, (3) Shenhu Yong, (4) Shenhu Bay, (5) Xinghua Bay, (6) Meizhou Bay, (7) Xipu, (8) Quanzhou Port. When the Japanese side announced the blockade last month, coastal areas of Fujian province, such as Xinghua and Quanzhou, were not included, so they could still be navigated. Now that the Japanese side has expanded the blockade, Shanghai-Fujian shipping will inevitably be completely interrupted. It is reported that the Shenyou, Xin'an Na, Yongfeng, and other ships along the coast of Fujian will also return to Shanghai.

Difficult to Navigate to Zhejiang

Regarding the Zhejiang coast, Ningbo has now been officially opened to navigation. However, the Changde ship, which sailed to Ningbo on the 7th, did not enter Aojiang until the evening before last. Unloading began yesterday. In addition, the British-owned Kellyton ship, which was originally scheduled to sail to Ningbo tomorrow, has decided to suspend its voyage due to the fact that ships are often inspected by Japanese warships and the route is not very smooth. In addition, the Far East Company's Hanna ship sailed from Shanghai to Aojiang on the morning of the 11th. It was inspected by a Japanese warship on the way but was immediately released and sailed to Aojiang. In addition, the German-owned Lihe Yanghang's Moufu ship, which was originally scheduled to sail to Aojiang at 8:00 AM on the morning of the 12th, was delayed due to loading cargo and did not depart until 6:00 AM yesterday morning. It is reported that in addition to loading cargo, the ship also carried hundreds of passengers.

Zhejiang Mail Arrives in Shanghai

After the interruption of Shanghai-Ningbo shipping, the exchange of mail has become a problem. Since Shanghai and Zhejiang discontinued shipping on the 16th of last month, Shanghai has not received mail from Baobo. Yesterday, a reporter from Datong News Agency learned that a large batch of mail from Ningbo and other places in eastern Zhejiang since the 16th of last month arrived in Shanghai yesterday, totaling more than 1,000 bags. Because it needs to be inspected by the Japanese side, it could not be distributed yesterday, but it is expected to be delivered separately starting today. This is the first batch of mail from Shanghai and Zhejiang to arrive in Shanghai after the interruption of shipping.

### Japanese Warships Shell Haimen Waters, More Than Twenty Shells

Ningbo sent another telegram yesterday reporting on the situation after the recovery of Zhenhai. The following is a record: (1) At 8:09 AM the morning before last, a Japanese warship sailed into the Haimen waters and anchored near the Haimen blockade line. At 2:05 PM, the Japanese warship suddenly sailed into the blockade line and fired more than twenty shells at the coast of Haimen without a specific target. The losses are being investigated. (2) At 6:45 AM the morning before last, three Japanese aircraft were spotted over Baiguan, flying from southeast to southwest, passing through Zhuji, Yiwu, and Jinhua, and circling several times in Jinhua and Yiwu before flying back the same way. At 8:25 AM, nine Japanese aircraft were spotted over Zhuji. Within five minutes, another nine were spotted, all flying towards Changle, Jianyang, Yiwu, Xianju, Yongjia, and other places before escaping south. (3) The day before yesterday, Zhenhai Jiangnan, Xiepu, and Wenzhou were all shelled by Japanese warships, but there were no Chinese losses. Yesterday, when three Japanese aircraft flew low to attack Ningbo, Huizheng Lane and Nantang outside the South Gate, as well as Qilidian and other places in the city, were strafed with machine guns, but there were no deaths or injuries. Only many bullet casings were found on the spot.

### Shanghai-Guangdong Airmail Suspended

The Postal Administration announced that airmail flights between Shanghai and Guangzhou have been suspended. This bureau is temporarily suspending the sending of all airmail to Guangzhou. Superintendent Zha Peilin.

### News Briefs

The Chinese Language Group of the French Concession Rent Investigation Committee was originally scheduled to hold its third joint meeting at the French Concession Taxpayers' Association at 8:00 PM yesterday. However, because yesterday was the anniversary of August 13th, it has been rescheduled to 8:00 PM this afternoon. The decision to hold the meeting on Tuesday as usual remains unchanged.

Small and large parcels to various parts of northern Jiangsu have been resumed. Large parcels are limited to 30 kilograms per piece. In addition to the posting fee of 15 cents per kilogram, a registration fee of 40 cents per piece will be charged. In addition, the acceptance of small and large parcels to and via Xinghua has been temporarily suspended. As for the small and large parcels previously accepted to various cities and counties in eastern Zhejiang, such as Shaoxing, Jinhua, Zhuji, Shangyu, Yuyao, Yiwu, Dongyang, Xianju, Xinchang, and Lanxi, the bureau has decided to find ways to transport them. The date of resumption of acceptance of small and large parcels to the above places is still pending the official resumption of Shanghai-Zhejiang shipping.

### Military Commanders of Various Countries to Meet Tomorrow to Discuss Defense Zone Issues, Held at Japanese Marine Corps Headquarters, Expected to Find an Appropriate Solution

The English-language "Greater Shanghai Evening Post" reported that rumors of changes that will occur after the British army withdraws from Shanghai are rife in the city today (the 13th). However, officials are keeping silent. It is said that no changes are expected until the military commanders of various countries hold a meeting on Thursday to discuss and reach a resolution. This morning, it was widely rumored that more than 1,000 Japanese troops had entered the Hailar Palace gambling den on the Great West Road. However, after investigation, it was found that there were only a few Japanese soldiers in the gambling den, apart from two Japanese trucks. As for the rumor that the Russian Detachment of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps will take over the West Hongkou defense zone of the British High Ground Team today, it has also been verified as untrue. Rear Admiral Takeda of the Japanese Navy, commander of the Japanese Naval Landing Forces in Shanghai, convened a meeting of the military commanders of various countries on Thursday. This meeting may be held around noon at the Japanese Marine Corps Headquarters on North Sichuan Road to decide which country's troops will take over the British defense zone.

Japanese Military Authorities Notify Meeting

The "Continental Daily" reported, according to the Domei News Agency, that it was revealed last night (the 12th) that Rear Admiral Takeda of the Japanese Navy, commander of the Japanese Naval Landing Forces in Shanghai, in his capacity as chairman of the Shanghai Joint Defense Committee, suggested to the commanders of the garrisons of various countries yesterday that a meeting of the Joint Defense Committee be convened on Thursday to decide which country's defense forces will take over police duties in the British defense zone after the withdrawal of the British troops.

French Commander Will Also Attend

According to the Japanese-language "Continental News", the commanders of the defense forces of Britain, the United States, Italy, and Japan will meet on Thursday. The commander of the International Settlement's Shanghai Volunteer Corps and the French garrison, as well as representatives of the Japanese army authorities, will also attend and listen. The resolutions reached at this important meeting will be final. Before the meeting, the authorities will make preliminary preparations among the Japanese naval and army and diplomatic officials stationed in Shanghai to formulate a unified position and maintain close contact with the Japanese government.

British and American Sides Reach Understanding

During the meeting, the Japanese side will resolutely oppose any motion to allow American troops to patrol the British defense zone. When the British and American defense commanders held a private meeting before the British side formally announced the withdrawal of British troops stationed in Shanghai, they must have reached some kind of understanding. However, the Japanese side will firmly oppose the one-sided agreement between the British and American authorities. It is expected that the meeting on Thursday will be difficult to reach a proper solution.

Exact Date of Withdrawal Still Unknown

Regarding the date of departure and withdrawal of the British defense forces stationed in Shanghai, the British side is still keeping silent. However, it is known that the British troops stationed in Shanghai announced yesterday that they will broadcast music on XCEN radio station from 8:30 PM to 9:00 PM on Friday, the 16th. This is the first time that the British army has broadcast in the city and is also a farewell commemoration for the British troops who have been stationed in Shanghai for more than two years. Therefore, the British defense forces will begin to withdraw after the 16th of this month.

### British Naval Authorities Deny Withdrawal from China, Considering it Pure Rumors

The "Continental Daily" reported that the rumor that the British Navy stationed in Chinese waters will withdraw along with the British Army was firmly denied yesterday (the 12th) by the British naval authorities in Shanghai. A senior British naval officer told reporters last night that he had never heard of this and that it must be pure rumors. According to news reports, a "responsible person" said that the British Navy stationed in China will closely follow the British Army and withdraw. Sources with good information claim that the New York Times telexed New York, predicting that the British Navy will withdraw from China, hence the above rumors.

### British Businessman Builds Houses in Wayside Area, Japanese Obstruct and Halt, Shanghai Municipal Council Receives Report, Does Not Recognize Japanese Building Regulations

The "North China Daily News" reported that a British construction and real estate company has recently been building houses on its property in the Wayside area of the International Settlement. The Japanese side has demanded that the company comply with certain building regulations recently promulgated by the Binbei Japanese authorities. The company refused, causing the construction work to be halted. A reporter inquired with the Shanghai Municipal Council about this matter. A spokesman for the council admitted that the council had received a report on this matter.

However, he emphasized that the council will not tacitly allow any other building regulations to be implemented within its jurisdiction, except for the regulations that the council has already implemented. The council will not recognize any encroachment of power by other parties within the concession. The Japanese Consulate in Shanghai has issued regulations stipulating that any company conducting construction work in Hongkou and Binbei must first register with the Japanese Naval Landing Forces. However, as far as he knows, these regulations only apply to Japanese people, and this is the first time that the Japanese side has demanded that a British company comply with the above regulations. The Japanese authorities have not obstructed the regulations of the Shanghai Municipal Council, and the council has not received formal notification of the Japanese side's implementation of its building regulations. However, the council will not tacitly allow the implementation of the Japanese side's regulations. He believes that this incident involving the British company is due to a misunderstanding and can be resolved clearly. The council has never received formal notification of the Japanese side's regulations, so he believes that the Japanese side issued these regulations only for Japanese people. It is said that Japanese people report to the Japanese authorities first when building houses. There is no reason to believe that the Japanese authorities intend to take actions contrary to the council's regulations or attempt to replace the council's regulations with other regulations.

### Tram Conductor Pushes Passenger

At 10:40 PM last night, French-owned Route 7 tram D-44, traveling from west to east, was at the West Xinqiao station. Passengers were disembarking one after another. Inside the third-class carriage, an elderly man from Zhenjiang, over sixty years old, was slow-moving due to his age, so he was the last to disembark. Just as his feet were stepping down, he was unexpectedly pushed by the ticket seller No. 367 on the tram, who closed the iron door immediately. Unable to support himself, the elderly man fell to the ground. It is said that he suffered a severe head injury and lost consciousness on the spot. Afterwards, nearby constables arrived and took the ticket seller to the police station for investigation. At the same time, they quickly summoned an ambulance to the scene and rushed him to Guangci Hospital for treatment.

### Ordering Fountain Pens, Issuing Bad Checks, Worth Over 7,000 Yuan, Main Culprit at Large

Cao Wenbo from Ningbo, the owner of Damei Fountain Pen Shop at 3 Donghua Lane, Fuzhou Road, previously ordered fountain pens worth 7,019 yuan from Shanghai Hufeng Fountain Pen Factory on Jiangxi Road. He paid with two checks from the West Ming Bank. When Hufeng went to cash them upon maturity, they were returned. Zheng Zixin, the legal representative of Hufeng, repeatedly urged Cao to pay the goods payment, but he always evaded. They were still negotiating at the New Capital Hotel the day before yesterday, but there was no result. Later, Zheng suddenly discovered that Cao had absconded, so he reported to the General Patrol Station, accusing Cao of fraudulently obtaining property. Chinese Detective Jin Deshun arrested a staff member from Ningbo, Lu Jixin, at the Damei shop at noon yesterday. Later, Cao's wife, Zhang, was also arrested at 3 Lane 16, South Wuxi Road, but Cao Wenbo was still not caught. This morning, Lu and Zhang were escorted to the criminal court of the First Special Court. Fang Fushu, the patrol station's lawyer, requested a postponement because the main culprit had not been caught. After Judge Shi interrogated them, he ordered them to be detained for a week for further questioning.

### British Man's Chinese Wife Accuses Brother of Assault, Transferring House and Occupying Belongings, Defendant Joined Portuguese Nationality and Refuses Summons

Fang Yulan, a Cantonese woman, 31 years old, is married to Mr. Hee, a British employee of the Shanghai Municipal Council in the International Settlement, and lives with him in Room 41, 4th Floor, Race Course Apartment, Race Course Road. Recently, she hired lawyer Ge Zhaoji to act as her agent and filed a lawsuit with the criminal court of the Second Special Court, accusing her brothers Fang Gao. Yasipeng (23 years old) and Fang Gao. Edwen (22 years old, both living at 37 Lafei Lane, Lafei Road, and both senior employees in a foreign company)

Occupying Property

And committing assault, etc. Her prosecution stated that the accuser lost her father at the age of 25. At that time, the family was destitute. The accuser relied entirely on her work in a foreign company, and also worked as a teacher in her spare time, as well as being a private English tutor, using her salary to support her elderly mother and two younger brothers (i.e., the defendants). Until the defendants became adults, she recommended them to the foreign company where they now work as employees so that they could become self-reliant. In November 1935, for the sake of her elderly mother,

Contributed to Rent in Concession

House number 37, Lafei Lane, so that her elderly mother and two younger brothers could live in the house. The furniture and other items were also purchased by the accuser. Some of them were borrowed from others. When the accuser went to Japan with her husband to escape the summer heat on May 10 of this year, the second defendant secretly transferred the house to his own name. When the accuser returned to Shanghai, she moved to her mother's house on July 2 to retrieve items borrowed from others. The defendant forcibly prevented her and committed violence, biting the accuser's arm. She reported it to the police station

The injury can be verified

Therefore, she should be prosecuted for the crimes under Article 277, Paragraph 1 and Article 335 of the Criminal Law. The court accepted the lawsuit, and Judge Huang Yan held a hearing yesterday morning. The defendants refused to appear in court. The accuser's lawyer stated that after the court summons was delivered to the defendants, it was said that they had joined Portuguese nationality and refused to accept it. The accuser and the defendants are all Chinese people and

Muslims

They have never joined other nationalities. In fact, after insulting the accuser, the defendants feared being condemned, so they specially contributed 2,000 yuan to join Portuguese nationality as a talisman to escape punishment. They should be strictly ordered to appear in court and severely punished according to law. The court ruled that the two defendants deliberately refused to appear in court and adjourned the hearing to August 20 for the defendants to appear in court for interrogation. If they still disobey, arrest warrants will be approved.

### Japanese Dancer at Far East Ballroom Arrested on Suspicion of Espionage, Japanese Consular Police Interrogating, Because She Supplied Japanese Military Secrets to British and Americans

(Dazhong News Agency) The Japanese-language "Continental News" reported that a Japanese woman named Miss Lin, 20 years old, who works as a dancer at the Far East Ballroom in Yong'an Building, has been arrested by the Japanese consular police on suspicion of engaging in espionage and is currently under strict interrogation. It is said that Miss Lin came to Shanghai from Hankou in June and worked as a hostess at the Junhu Coffee Shop before changing to a dancer at the end of July. She obtained secret information from Japanese military personnel and supplied it to the British and American sides. It is heard that the interrogation has implicated many other dancers engaged in espionage activities. It is expected that this spy group will be wiped out soon.

### Peiping Resident Ma Ziren Scares and Blackmails His Sister-in-Law and Her Husband; Debate Concludes, Sentencing Scheduled

Ma Ziren, a 30-year-old resident of Peiping and a graduate of Northeastern University, was entrusted by his mother-in-law the winter before last to take his sister-in-law, Yan Jing (also known as Yan Jingbo, a 20-year-old resident of Peiping), to Kunming for her studies. He carried with him 700 yuan for travel expenses. Unexpectedly, Ma had wicked intentions and did not escort Yan to Kunming. Instead, he brought her from Peiping

to Shanghai.

At the Huizhong Hotel on Sanma Road, he raped her and they began living together. When the money ran out, Ma ordered her to work as a dance hostess at the Dadong Ballroom. At that time, Yan met Chen Dingming (a 43-year-old native of Ningbo working as a senior clerk at the Laili Foreign Firm, residing at No. 25, Lane 42, Beidiao'ao Road). Friendship developed, and soon a relationship blossomed. Chen then instructed Yan to quit dancing, offering to cover her living expenses. Thus, Yan

took up residence at Chen's home.

Ma also followed, but secretly opposed the matter vehemently. He also insisted that Yan marry him. This came to Chen's attention, and he offered Yan 300 yuan to sever ties with Ma, and an additional 2,000 yuan as pocket money. However, Ma learned of this and spent his days indulging in pleasure and frequenting gambling dens. He would secretly demand money from Yan, ultimately depleting her 2,000 yuan savings. On the afternoon of the 25th of last month, at 8:30 PM, Ma once again

demanded money from Yan.

When Yan had no money to give, Ma went to the kitchen, grabbed a cleaver, and threatened Yan and Chen. Chen reported this to the police, who dispatched detective Qin Bichang to arrest Ma and bring him to the First Criminal Court of the Special No. 2 Court. After a brief interrogation by Judge Liao, as the police investigation was incomplete, the case was adjourned. These details were reported in previous news. Yesterday morning, the adjourned hearing took place. Police attorney Gu Shouxi, invoking Article 346 of the criminal law,

charged Ma with intimidation.

First, the plaintiffs Chen Dingming, Yan Jing, and Yan's mother recounted the events. When questioned, the defendant adamantly denied threatening them with a knife, but admitted to suffering from a nervous disorder. After reviewing the testimony, the court determined that the case was clear and ordered closing arguments. Sentencing was scheduled for the 17th. The defendant was remanded to custody.

### Chinese Flour Mills Exhausted Stock; Imminent Shutdown Rumored; Inland Flour Rushes to Shanghai

The various Chinese flour mills within the Shanghai International Settlement have exhausted their raw material inventories. Orders for foreign wheat have not arrived, and domestic wheat is blockaded and unavailable. As a last resort, they resolved yesterday to shut down all operations within the week. The remaining flour, already in meager quantities, will also be sold off within days before ceasing wholesale operations. As flour is essential for northerners and the working class, and is a crucial aspect of the city's food supply, the reporter presents the following investigation:

Unified Control of New Wheat: Painful Maintenance

It is found that the Chinese flour mills within the Shanghai International Settlement, still include Fufeng New and Old Factories, Fuxin numbers seven and eight, and Huafeng Factory (large and small, six or seven in total). Operating at full capacity, they can produce seventy to eighty thousand bags daily. Besides supplying the local market, they can also sell surplus to merchants from north and south. However, since the new wheat came to the market this year, it has been under unified control, with transport to Shanghai forbidden. For two months, various attempts have been made, and discussions with different parties held, to seek relief, but the aim of procurement was never achieved. The flour mills have faced significant difficulties regarding their own property rights, trademarks, sales regions, employee livelihoods, and the city's food supply, painfully maintaining and sacrificing by selling at a loss for more than half a year.

Ordered Foreign Wheat: Still Not Arrived

Subsequently, mills have increased costs to absorb local wheat and order foreign wheat. However, even with the increased costs, local wheat is difficult to continuously deliver. Foreign wheat, due to a lack of ships, foreign exchange, and economic issues, only had orders for two ships from America and Australia. Furthermore, wheat orders are affected by the international situation, and have not arrived in Shanghai as scheduled. It is said that in the past, the flour industry only suffered from costs exceeding the selling price, sluggish sales, and resulting losses. Now, even the desire to painfully maintain operations is impossible.

No Immediate Impact on Food Supply

Furthermore, the northern sales regions have been entirely occupied by foreign flour, making it difficult for Shanghai flour to gain a foothold. The Nanyang area is frequently blockaded. The city and inland areas are also being overrun by foreign and domestically produced flour. Therefore, the future of the flour industry is already in a dire situation, not just because of the current raw material shortage forcing shutdowns. Fortunately, the supply of flour related to the city's food supply is not currently facing problems. Flour from Wuxi's Guangfeng and Jiufeng, Changzhou's Hengfeng, and the Yangtze River's Yicheng, Yangzi, and Tailai factories is arriving in Shanghai successively to meet demand. For foreign flour, Weida Foreign Firm's Pao Tai brand new flour has also been shipped. The prospect for the city's food supply does not seem to suffer from a shortage due to the Shanghai factories' shutdown.

### Economical Water Tank Coal Stove

Dalai Factory recently invented the Sansheng water tank coal stove, which utilizes the wasted heat around the frying stove to heat the water tank pipes. On the left side, there is a large water tank which produces over two hundred gallons of hot water and boiled water daily. The frying stove can still be used to cook meals as usual, and the stove mouth can be sealed after cooking to save coal balls. However, the water in the tank gradually heats up, so it can be used at any time. It is not only economical but also convenient, making it an indispensable economical hot water system for homes, stores, schools, hospitals, and factories. It is said that the equipment can also be retrofitted onto existing coal stoves. A sales office is located at No. 61 Chengdu Road, Foch Road intersection, telephone 93566.

### Weather Report

The Xujiahui Observatory's weather forecast at 4:30 PM yesterday: Shandong, this area, and the East Sea have trade wind air masses; sunny and hot weather; occasional cloud cover; southeasterly winds; a hurricane in the Pacific Ocean is moving northwest or west. The hurricane's center at 2 PM was within 15 degrees north latitude and 130 to 120 miles east longitude. Wind direction northwest or west, wind force unknown. Also, in the 24 hours before 3 PM yesterday, the local temperature was highest 96.1, lowest 75.2; the same day last year, highest 90.7, lowest 76.3.

### Two Rice Merchants Arrested in Avenue Joffre French Concession; One Ding Zhijian, One Xu Linshu; Shen Wenda Arrested Simultaneously, Later Released

Around 6 AM yesterday morning, three plainclothes military police officers from the Japanese Military Police Corps, in two cars, went to the French Concession Police Station, requesting officers to accompany them on official business. The Police Station dispatched several detectives who went with them to No. 3, Lane 189 (i.e., Ruifuli), Avenue Joffre. First, they arrested two men inside. They then found the business card of Shen Wenda, the landlord of the house, who had previously served as the squad leader of the West Gate Branch of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau's Detective Team, in Shen's bedroom, and arrested Shen as well. They took them to the police station and then handed them over to the Japanese Military Police Corps. As Shen was unrelated, he was released. It is understood that the other two men, Ding Zhijian and Xu Linshu, are rice merchants who were staying at Shen's house because they had danced late at a certain ballroom the night before.

French Police Search San De Fang

Around 6 AM yesterday morning, the French Police Department dispatched a large contingent of Chinese and foreign detectives to search San De Fang on Rue Lupan, Rue Saussier. The residents in the lane were thoroughly inspected until about 8 AM. They found nothing.

Preparatory Director Xie Xunchu is currently in negotiations to purchase land and build. The internal organization will establish seven departments including Civic Education, Literature, History, Science, Chemistry, Music, and Home Economics, as well as a Physical Education specialty. It is expected to open the next semester, admitting only first-year freshmen. The preparatory expenses are 200,000 yuan, and the regular expenses are over 16,000 yuan per month for the first period.

### Increase in Living Expenses for Primary and Secondary School Teachers in War Zones

The living expenses of primary and secondary school teachers in war zones registered by the education departments of various provinces and the Third Service Corps are extremely low.

The Ministry of Education has found ways to raise funds, and starting in June, the living expenses of registered qualified primary and secondary school teachers in war zones will be increased by five yuan per month. Those not assigned work will not receive the increase.

### Increase in Meal Loans for Impoverished Students in War Zones

Meal loans for impoverished students from war zones attending colleges and above, national middle schools, and Sun Yat-sen middle school classes were previously increased once due to high grain prices and the inadequacy of the original amount. Recently, as grain prices have not decreased, the situation in various regions has been considered and appropriately increased to ensure that students in all regions have enough to eat.

### Financial Review (Continued)

— Sheng Kai

The Seriousness of Shanghai's Prices

According to the Municipal Council's report, the general index of living costs for workers in Shanghai reached 449.18 in July, with a currency purchasing power of 22.26. In other words, the cost of living for Shanghai workers has increased by four and a half times compared to 1936, and the purchasing power of one yuan is now only a little over two jiao and two fen of 1936. Looking at the seven months of this year, the general index has been rising continuously from 325.44 in January, except for slight declines in March and April. The food category in the classification index also follows this trend; rent remained stable for the first six months, but suddenly rose by 43.36 in July; the clothing category rose straight to 403.85 in May, then repeatedly fell back to 326.79 in July; the fuel category decreased monthly from 474.61 in March to 444.62 in July; and the miscellaneous category steadily increased throughout.

From this analysis, we can derive two concepts: First, the rise in the general index is most deeply affected by food, and in July, the increase in rent further exacerbated the situation. Second, the decline in the clothing and fuel categories is far less than the rise in the food category index, so its impact on the general index is very slight. Due to these two concepts, Shanghai citizens have doubts about how much effort the concession authorities are putting into balancing prices.

In view of the seriousness of the Shanghai price problem, the concession authorities only established an evaluation committee in February of this year, and announced sixteen articles of regulations on the 19th of the same month. The Public Concession's Municipal Council also began to study countermeasures. On April 12th and 13th, the French Consulate and the Public Concession's Municipal Council issued announcements one after another, for the purpose of effectively stabilizing prices, requiring stores to mark the retail price per unit for designated foods (including rice, flour, oil, salt, tea, sugar, milk, meat, eggs, fish, vegetables, fruits), fuels (including coal, charcoal, kerosene), and soap. It seemed that further measures were being taken to stabilize prices. However, the two concession authorities were only able to publish average price lists for the fixed retail food, fuel, and soap products on a regular basis. They had no effective way to deal with the speculation and manipulation in wholesale prices. On the contrary, they only did some empty work, such as announcing on May 3rd a ban on taking advantage of exchange rate fluctuations to raise prices. The Public Concession authorities even sent letters to relevant commercial organizations on the 18th of the same month, urging them to lower prices. This did not have any effect on stabilizing prices. The food category, which the authorities put the greatest and only effort into stabilizing, not only did not decrease slightly like the clothing and fuel categories, but instead saw a long-term increase, from 337.97 in January to 485.80 in July. The citizens of Shanghai are definitely not deliberately criticizing the concession authorities' price stabilization work, but the results of their work are clearly being countered (such as the rise in the food category index), which makes the citizens of Shanghai, who are suffering from the heavy pressure of life, feel as if they have a bone stuck in their throat.

Some may say that Shanghai is surrounded by occupied areas, and it is very difficult to purchase goods that are easily available and very cheap due to various obstacles and exorbitant taxes, so prices have to rise, which is a real difficulty. However, the key to price stabilization is to dredge transportation, crack down on hoarding, prevent speculation, and prohibit manipulation. If these difficulties cannot be resolved, it is clear that the price stabilization work cannot be carried out to its full extent.

In short, the fact that Shanghai's price problem is becoming more serious day by day is definitely not a blessing for Shanghai's future. We are also well aware of the difficulties faced by the concession authorities in handling this, but this is a matter of common interest. We know that it is futile to say more, but fortunately, the concession authorities, with the welfare of the citizens as their premise, will surely take measures to alleviate the urgent crisis. (End)

### Food - More Foreign Rice Arrives in Shanghai

More foreign rice has arrived in Shanghai. The Taikoo Company's Jinan vessel arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong the day before yesterday (12th), carrying 934 bags of foreign rice. It docked at the company's own wharf in the French Concession and unloading was completed yesterday. The Jardine Matheson & Co.'s Yisheng vessel arrived yesterday morning, carrying 1,064 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong. It docked at the Roosevelt Wharf for unloading. In addition, the Taikoo Company's Haikou vessel, carrying 1,724 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong, arrived in Shanghai yesterday. It is said that this batch of foreign rice is scheduled to be shipped to Yantai on the same vessel today.

### Coal - Outsiders Hoarding Coal for Speculation is Like Spinning a Cocoon Around Themselves

In recent weeks, the foreign coal market has been stimulated by the tightening of foreign exchange. Generally, cargo owners have taken this opportunity to raise the prices of both bituminous and anthracite coal by 20 to 30 yuan, whether openly or secretly. Outsiders are hoarding goods, and factory users, upon hearing this news, are vying to search for and absorb large quantities of coal, believing they can monopolize a rare commodity. This is all because in the spring of this year, due to the gradual increase in coal prices, many ordering merchants profited greatly. As a result, they became greedy and purchased large quantities, with imports exceeding normal levels. Summer is usually a slow selling season. Since various ports and the coastal areas of eastern Zhejiang have been blockaded, most factories have suspended work, and the occupied areas are controlled by a certain party, making it impossible to move fuel. Deliveries continue uninterrupted, and by autumn, the stocks in warehouses on both sides of the Huangpu River in this city will reach approximately 700,000 to 800,000 tons of bituminous and anthracite coal, which is sufficient to meet the needs of the autumn and winter seasons for half a year. Therefore, even with the expansion of the Anglo-French war, there is no fear of fuel shortage in this city. Although foreign exchange has tightened slightly on the cost side, who knows that due to the blockade of various routes, there is a surplus of ships and competition among peers, so freight rates have fallen without being lowered. Therefore, although coal merchants have increased the cost of goods, freight and other expenses have also been reduced a lot. "Losing at sunrise, gaining at sunset." After offsetting each other, the cost remains unchanged. Based on the current situation, there is no possibility of price increases. Therefore, outsiders using coal hoarding for speculation is like spinning a cocoon around themselves. (Pei Ben)

### Imports and Exports - Both Foreign and Native Goods Are Being Transacted

### Soap

— Liu Tang

Long days of boredom, sitting quietly at home, I occasionally chat with my children about past events to pass the time. Bingzhong then asked me what the character "zao" in "feizao" (soap) means. I said: "Zao was originally written as 皂, 皂 is its common form. Zao means the color black. In ancient times, lowly officials and servants were called 'zao' and 'li,' and later, government soldiers were called 'zao li.' This is the origin. When officials ascended the court, they held staffs and stood in rank, and when they went out, they shouted to clear the way. They wore tall, pointed hats and straight-collared robes of a dark brown color. A close examination of the character 皂 reveals a servant standing upright, wearing a hat and holding a staff. It is said that the hats of the servants symbolized the crowns worn by the Yuan imperial family. The Ming Taizu destroyed the Yuan dynasty and used them as hats for servants. Therefore, this hat has a rich historical significance." Bingzhong then asked me, "Since zao means brownish-black, why is the color of soap not black but yellow?" I said, "The zao of the past was black, but the zao of today is yellow. The term 'feizao' (soap) existed in China, but the soap used today is not the original Chinese soap, but soap introduced from foreign countries." In ancient China, the things used for washing were: (1) soap pods, (2) alkali, and (3) ash lye. Soap pods are the name of a tree, which can grow to a height of several zhang. It blooms yellow-green flowers in the summer, and after the flowers, it bears pods, which are flat like broad bean pods but larger, and can be seven or eight cun long. From a distance, they look like knives in scabbards, and their color is black, so they are called soap pods, also known as soap horns. Boiling the pods in water can be used for washing clothes. Choose the pods that are long, plump, fatty, and sticky, mash them into a paste, and mold them into squares. That is called 'feizao' (soap). Add fragrance, and it is called 'xiangzao' (perfumed soap). The name 'feizao' originated from this. In the past, many people in the Suzhou and Shanghai area made this kind of soap. Its color was black, and the fragrance varied, such as osmanthus. When I was young, I often saw my late father like to use it. Although there were perfumed soaps such as Maosheng at that time, people still habitually used the locally made osmanthus soap. However, the quality was rough and painful to the skin, so when foreign soap was imported, the local soap gradually lost its use. (Currently, the Jinlixu powder shop still sells soap pod soap.)"

Alkali is mostly transported from the north. There are two kinds, one is transparent and the other is opaque. It is produced in places such as Baotou, which are called saline-alkali lands. In the past, it was transported south from Tianjin, transferred to Yingkou, and then barged by sand boats. Poor families used grass and wood ash and placed it in a bamboo basket, lined with thatch, filled with ash, and watered it daily to filter it. The water that dripped down contained alkali, that is, calcium carbonate, for washing.

When did foreign soap start to enter China? This is difficult to determine. Dream of the Red Chamber is the book that best reflects the life of a group of nobles during the Kangxi and Yongzheng reigns. The only mention of soap in Dream of the Red Chamber is in the twenty-first chapter, when Xiangyun washed her face, Bao Yu took the opportunity to wash his face in the leftover water, and Zijuan handed him perfumed soap. Bao Yu said, "There is enough in this basin, no need to rub." It is not known whether the perfumed soap used here was a foreign product or a local product. But judging from the era, the local product was more likely. First, the author of Dream of the Red Chamber often highlighted foreign objects. Second, the import of foreign goods only became prevalent after the reigns of Qianlong, Jiaqing, and Daoguang. Third, judging from the word "rub," it must have been the old soap. The perfumed soap made from soap pods was rough and hard, not as soft and smooth as modern perfumed soap, so it was necessary to "rub" hard when washing. In addition, women used to moisturize their skin with either pancreas, taken from pig organs and soaked in wine, which could remove chapped skin and make the skin smooth, or honey, which was used for smearing. When foreign honey (glycerin) was imported, this method was naturally eliminated. Foreign honey is glycerin, and glycerin is a by-product of soap, so they are intrinsically linked.

Since I could not find out when soap first entered China, I thought of visiting Mr. Zhu Zhiyao. Mr. Zhiyao is already seventy-eight years old and grew up in Shanghai. He devoted himself to the industry at an early age, and his energetic spirit has not diminished. Mr. Zhiyao said that when he was over ten years old, people still used the old method for washing clothes, and there was no soap like the one used today. Only foreign perfumed soap existed, but it was not yet popular. According to his recollection, it seemed that the manager of a certain German foreign firm said to his Chinese manager: "I am thinking of traveling abroad with you to investigate which goods are most suitable for sale in China." When the Chinese manager returned, he told the foreign manager that there were two goods that were the cheapest and most widely used: one was soap for washing clothes, and the other was thread for sewing clothes. The foreign manager followed his advice and achieved great sales. However, at that time, Chinese people also imitated the manufacture of soap, but due to simple equipment and small scale, the products were of very poor quality, yellow in color and with a lot of moisture. When fresh, they were very soft and moist, making them unsuitable for scrubbing. They were commonly called "yellow pumpkin soap." After overnight, they became extremely hard and contained a lot of alkali, which easily damaged clothes. However, due to the lack of good soap, people still happily used it. Since the Xiangmao and Guben soaps were launched one after another (in addition, there were also soaps such as Beiji, which were of pure quality and convenient for users), the Guben factory was originally run by a German merchant, who returned to his country during World War I, and was then invested in and managed by Wuzhou, and it still stands as a giant in the Chinese soap manufacturing industry.

Yesterday was August 13th, and most businesses were closed, so I wrote this to fill the void in commerce and finance. I originally had a work called "Economic Miscellany," in which I wanted to organize and study the origins of people's livelihood economics and everyday goods. When I have the opportunity, I will meet with readers again.

### Scenery of Xuanwu Lake

Outside the Taiping Gate of Jinling, there is Xuanwu Lake, which has a circumference of thirty li. All around it are planted water chestnuts and lotus. Three sides are inaccessible to people. There are fishing households on five isles who make fishing their livelihood for generations. A separate official is appointed to manage the fishing tax, and the lotus seeds produced are also managed and sold by them, yielding substantial profits. After the Taiping Rebellion was put down, when Zeng Wenzheng Gong was the Governor-General of Liangjiang, there were famine refugees from Jiangbei coming to Ning. He imitated the method of providing relief through labor, ordering them to build a dike, and constructing several bridges in the middle to allow water to flow. The dike is several li long and incomparably strong. Commentators say that it can be compared to the Su and Bai dikes of West Lake, shining in succession. At the end of the dike is the Lake God Temple, which was originally there and rebuilt. Next to the temple, there is a three-room building, with a small portrait of Zeng Wenzheng Gong hanging in the middle. Mr. Xue Weinong of Taicang wrote a couplet for the building: "In human society, a prime minister; in heaven, a deity. Indeed, returning to the true nature of Penglai, one can imagine that Yuanjiao and Fanghu have such water. A small troop once came, leaving behind a great name that will never fade. Leaving behind the loving memory of the lake and mountains, comparable to Xie An and Wang Dao, each possessing a thousand autumns." Climbing the building and looking far away, one can only see green clouds stretching for ten thousand acres, encircling without end, and the soaring green mountains, extending as far as the eye can see, are especially worthy of gazing upon. Imagining the scenes of flower viewing, there must be countless things to behold. Reciting Mr. Yuan Jianzhai's line, "Imagining the heart for flowers is deeper than seeing the flowers," one cannot help but sigh for a long time. On the side of the temple gate, there is a well, named Bronze Hook. According to the monks in charge, the well was dug more than two zhang deep, and a bronze hook was found, and the spring water gushed out. The taste is clear and cold, comparable to the Yongning Spring of Yuhuatai. Trying it, it is not mistaken. It is a pity that the bronze hook was presented to the county office and could not be seen, which is regrettable!

Spring and Autumn

### Exploration of Health Care Issues

— Cao Jian

Everyone knows that cities, due to their large population and polluted air, are also the places where various diseases are most rampant and prevalent. Since the war, the number of people coming to Shanghai from various places has increased day by day. For economic reasons, it doesn't seem to matter if several families live in a small house. If you are unlucky enough to have someone in your family get sick, it will be even worse. Sometimes the illness is contagious, and then you have to infect one by one. For the poor, it is not easy to see a doctor. They can't even get enough to eat, so how can they have money to see a doctor? Therefore, many poor people die of illness, either because of incompetent doctors or because they leave it to fate and pray for the arrival of death. This is such a tragic thing! I want to talk about social health care work here, nothing more than for the health of the public, and to hope to reduce the number of poor people who die unnatural deaths. I hope that those who are interested can pay attention to it.

I believe that the issue of social health care is not a simple matter, nor is it a personal matter, but a matter for the public. Social health care work is multifaceted, requiring the enthusiastic cooperation of everyone, as well as self-sacrificing people to come out and advocate and implement it, and many people to widely publicize it, so that everyone understands the true meaning of health care work. Everyone contributing a little more effort will also reap more rewards. The following points are my personal thoughts on social health care work, but they still need to be supplemented, researched, and explored by experts and other people.

### Compliance with Public Health

Cities have large populations, and if everyone does not pay attention to public health, then diseases will be even more rampant. There are still many people who do not understand the true meaning of public health and still spit and urinate everywhere. We must all know that spitting on the ground may not seem to matter much, but if there are bacteria in the sputum, it is easy to spread to others. For the sake of our own and others' health, we should all change our bad habits.

### Establishment of Health Care Associations

The main purpose of establishing health care associations is to give the general public the opportunity to receive diagnosis and treatment before their illnesses become serious. Many people neglect their problems when they first start, and only go to the doctor when they are terminally ill. How can they be cured then? Our current society needs some famous doctors to come out and establish health care associations so that everyone has the opportunity to get medical treatment. The Luo Luo Medical Clinic in Los Angeles, USA, is a famous health care association with thriving business. People who join the Luo Luo Medical Clinic only need to pay a certain fee each year to get famous doctors to diagnose and treat their diseases, and can also have regular physical health checkups to understand their physical condition. If everyone can go to the doctor when their problems are not serious, then the doctor will not have to make much effort to cure their problems, and the patients themselves can avoid suffering from serious illnesses.

### Doctors Must Have a Heart to Help the World

Many poor people suffer from diseases and want to see a doctor, but they cannot afford it because the consultation fees are too expensive. Therefore, I hope that doctors must have a heart to help the world, and spend some time to treat the poor, either by providing free treatment or only charging for medicine.

### Widely Conduct Health Education Work

There are many things that can be done in health education work, such as publishing regular health publications, broadcasting common health knowledge, investigating the health status of the poor, and holding health education weeks.

The above points are what I personally feel are the most needed social health care work, but I know that social health care work is certainly not that simple. I sincerely hope to elicit discussions and opinions from experts.

### Waste Utilization

— Qing Hui

In the recruitment column, a large company is seeking two mute secretaries. I speculate that their intentions are no more than the following three points: First, they can strictly keep secrets; second, they can scold at will without protest; and third, the environment is dangerous, and free speech may lead to personal disaster. In addition to this, there are two other disabled people who can be used: one is a lame accountant, because the lame person is not easy to run around, and can guard the treasury to the death. The other is a blind servant, because he cannot recognize the true faces of the master's friends. However, in this time of unemployment panic, there may be people who are forced to pretend to be mute, blind, or lame. Recruiters must be cautious.

### Save the Poor Children Who Are Out of School – A Letter from a Teacher at a Summer Neighborhood Children's Voluntary School –

— Yu Bi

Dear Editor:

We are a group of young middle school students. In order to serve the society and help out-of-school children in general, we have opened a voluntary school during the summer vacation. Tuition is free, and books are also provided by us.

In the short period of nearly one and a half months of teaching, we have found that among many poor children, there are many who are intelligent and have good grades. So the problem arises, if our voluntary school ends, won't these intelligent and excellent poor students have to drop out of school again? This makes us feel very unbearable, but we don't have the power to provide them with tuition fees. So I hope that the editor can publish this letter so that people from the society and charitable organizations can give us a hand to help these poor children continue their studies. We would be very grateful for that. I wish you

All the best! Teacher of the Shanghai YMCA Middle School Neighborhood Children's Voluntary School

If there are charitable people or organizations that can help us, please write directly to 599 Sichuan Road, and we will send someone to contact you. The China United Amusement Association has always spared no effort in promoting welfare for its members. Recently, a high-end barber shop has been added, costing one yuan for four times and shaving the face costing 9 jiao 6 for four times. Coupons are printed and sold by the association's consumer cooperative. For each haircut or shave, one coupon is paid, and no additional costs are required. According to those who have tried it, "life" is also done well, so many people have been going to the barber shop to get "economic haircuts" recently.

Hawthorne's Case

### The Final Destination of the Dance Queen

— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter 5 Bad News

The old man stared at him fiercely and asked, "What are you doing?"

The young man said, "I want to find that Zhao person."

"No, get out of here!"

"He was here yesterday."

"I came here today. You're dreaming!"

Before the sound of "dreaming" had disappeared, the door slammed shut again. Yu Gantang seemed very annoyed. The right side of his clothes suddenly bulged, obviously a gun barrel. This guy is really too reckless. He knocked on the wrong person's room. Did he even want to shoot? Fortunately, at this time, a waiter in a white gown walked over from the east end. Seeing Yu Gantang about to raise his hand to knock on the door again, he rushed over to stop him. "Sir, who are you looking for?" "That Zhao person—uh, that Qian person." "You're mistaken. The person inside is named Jin." "He was here yesterday." "Yes, Mr. Qian moved out last night. You can't knock on people's doors like this."

I couldn't see the number of this waiter clearly, but it wasn't the 71 just now. His nimble words actually prevented Yu Gantang from acting out.

He glared at the waiter and asked, "Where did he move to?"

The experienced waiter also bravely returned his glare and replied coldly, "Who knows?" He then went back to the east end on his own.

At this time, I was only concerned with the tense situation in front of me, but I forgot about my own cover. A middle-aged man in a suit was walking over from behind me. I glanced at the corner of my eye, thinking it was Hawthorne. It wasn't. That man was also wearing a dark suit, and a black felt hat was pressed low, and the gaze under the brim was clearly fixed on me. I couldn't help but feel a little embarrassed. In fact, my posture was indeed easy to arouse suspicion. I simply stooped down, pulled out the knot of my shoelaces, and slowly retied it. This posture actually got me through two difficult situations. The middle-aged man and Yu Gantang both brushed past me in front of me. Except for the middle-aged man turning his head to look at me again, Yu Gantang walked straight to the west exit without looking sideways. When I stood up straight again, Yu Gantang's back was already gone. (75)

### The Automatic Sacrifice of Christ (II)

Last time we mentioned that the automatic sacrifice of Christ teaches us what love is, what true friendship is, but what else? (III) It should teach us what "real" sacrifice is: The sacrifices that ordinary people shout about, shaking the heavens, are mostly not sacrifices at all. Some people who are used to swindling others think that defrauding others of a little less money is a sacrifice. There are also some ambitious people who think they are making a sacrifice by slightly reducing the level of their desires. In reality, strictly speaking, whether it is sacrificing time, energy, money, or anything else, as long as you harbor some hope, it is not a sacrifice. A big clearance sale in a store cannot be considered a sacrifice; only giving away for free can be considered a sacrifice. Jesus' sacrifice was without any return. He willingly gave his life so that the people of the world could be saved. (IV) It teaches us how the teachings can be completed: Jesus said, "Whoever wants to be first must be your slave, just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many." (Matthew 20:27) The meaning of "ransom for many" is that one person dies in place of many. This spirit is admired by believers and non-believers alike. Jesus was crucified, and all who believed in him and followed in his footsteps were saved. Moreover, the scope of this salvation is not limited by time, space, or race; the sins of mankind throughout the ages and in all nations are forgiven entirely through the death of Jesus.

There was once a poor widow who, through her earnings as a servant, painstakingly raised her orphaned child until he graduated from university. On the day her son graduated from university, she went to attend the graduation ceremony, hoping that her son would give her some comfort. Who knew that her son, because he already had the daughter of a wealthy man as his fiancée, did not want this lady to know that he had such a mother who worked as a servant. So, he buried his conscience and pointed at his birth mother, saying to others, "This is a longtime maid in my house. I only sucked on her milk a few times when I was little, and it's not a big deal." This university student, because he was afraid of losing his fiancée, actually had the heart to disown his birth mother. He was truly ungrateful and extremely shameful! Jesus is a friend who gave his life for us. How can we not recognize him as the Savior and only think of this as a tragic scene in history? Readers who wish to know more details, please send a letter to the Shanghai Aiwenyi Road No. 351 Literary Evangelism Society, and you will receive a detailed reply.

### A Glimpse of Guilin's Entertainment Industry

— Xiao Qi

Guilin is now one of the six major cities in China, and it is full of vigor. No matter what kind of undertaking, it is constantly growing with a lively posture; the entertainment aspect is naturally no exception.

Guilin currently has nine theaters, with Peking opera, Cantonese opera, spoken drama, and Guilin opera, everything is available and complete. Guilin opera is a kind of local opera popular in the lower and middle classes of Guilin society, somewhere between Peking opera and Xiang opera. Although the three belong to the same origin, they have developed independently for a long time and have their own indelible local characteristics, carrying a unique color. Its tune does not seem as tactful and varied as Peking opera, and sometimes it is not as sonorous and crisp as Peking opera, but its simple style is especially suited to the tastes of the local people. Especially the words are relatively easy to understand, truly as clear as daylight, even old women can understand. Its performance is slower, and sometimes not as lively as Peking opera; but the acting is very delicate and comfortable, extremely moving.

The "Guangxi Drama Improvement Association" is organized by dozens of people from the Party, government, military, education, and art circles who are enthusiastic about cultural movements and have similar interests. The late Dr. Ma Junwu, president of Guangxi University, served as the president, and Mr. Bai Pengfei served as the vice president. They began to improve Guilin opera. Later, the playwright Ouyang Yuqian came to Guilin and organized a sound troupe. In the summer of last year, they began rehearsing the famous play "Liang Hongyu," and later successively rehearsed several famous works such as "The Peach Blossom Fan," "Mulan Joins the Army," "Searching the Temple and Reversing Justice," and "Victory Year," and the results were very good. As for the performance techniques, dance, set design, lighting, and costumes, they are all extremely advanced. For example, the expressive play "Human Face Peach Blossoms" has gained considerable praise. Therefore, the innovation and progress of Guilin opera are all due to the advocacy and reform of Dr. Ma Junwu and the guidance of Mr. Ouyang Yuqian. In addition, there are also modernized entertainments that have arisen with the times, such as swimming pools. In the Zizhou area of the Lijiang River in the eastern suburbs of Guilin, the river water is now used to develop swimming pools. The river water is clear, and the aquatic plants and pebbles at the bottom of the river are clearly visible. Compared with the seaside bays in Hong Kong and the Gaoqiao swimming pool in Shanghai, although the size is different and the equipment is simpler, the clear water is like oil, and the overlapping mountains on both sides are reflected in the water, lush and verdant, the scenery is far better than Hong Kong and Shanghai. Therefore, general modern men and women often come here in droves to enjoy their swimming addiction; or a leaf of a boat, let go in the middle of the river, let it go, sing loudly, there is a tendency to be happy and forget to return.

### Chen Yunshang's Family Life

— Yan Ciping

There is a delicate study room to find spiritual food; there is a spacious platform to enjoy family happiness. There is a newly built Western-style house on Julai Road. There is often a beautiful car driving in and out. You can often see a lively and charming girl, using a brisk, almost dance-like pace, stepping onto or out of that car. She is the girl that the majority of movie fans care about—silver screen star Miss Chen Yunshang.

The three floors have a total of three large rooms, which are very comfortably assigned to three use rooms, one as a bedroom, one as a study room, and one as a rest room and reception room. The arrangement is exquisite and elegant. Her study room has many bookshelves and cabinets, filled with literary books, movie publications, and many other books that can increase knowledge. The girl often uses her soft fingers to caress them affectionately, like a loving mother caressing her own child.

Every day she has to sit there for several hours, reading the daily newspaper, reading movie publications, and paying more attention to the criticisms written about herself on them. She carefully cuts out the words and photos about her one by one and pastes them in a notebook, becoming a very interesting and valuable scrapbook. She also studies books about film expression or art. Although her expression is already top-notch, and her art is already on the road to success, she is still not satisfied and is still diligently pursuing all knowledge.

She not only spends time reading books, but also has to play the piano and sing. Every day at 2 pm, she has to study English, except when she is very busy and cannot spare the time, she never interrupts. Chen Yunshang is a Guangdong girl, but she can speak fluent and crisp Mandarin. Before she came to Shanghai, her Mandarin was not very pure, but after studying for a few months, she improved rapidly, which even made her Mandarin teacher He Jianfei admire. She is a pure 20th-century modern girl. In terms of private life, she will not go with the flow and be as romantic as ordinary female stars. She is a filial daughter and a good sister. When the situation in Hong Kong was tense, Chen Yunshang was worried about her father and sister living there, so she asked them to come to Shanghai. Adding two more people out of thin air meant that one floor of the house was not enough to live in. Yunshang could not bear to see her family crowded together uncomfortably, so she rented the four-story building in the public apartment and provided it for them to live in. The four-story building was more spacious than the three-story building. There were also two large rooms, and there was also a large platform. The cool summer breeze often blew from the platform. The platform was covered with canvas, which was very delicate, with the flavor of a night garden. Every night when Yunshang had time, she would sit on that platform with her family and enjoy family happiness.

### Li Shengzao's Entourage Arrives in Shanghai

— Wei Wo

Sheng (old male role) actor Li Shengzao, at the invitation of the Golden Grand Theater, took the Shuntian Wheel from Tianjin to Shanghai yesterday and arrived at the port at 10 am. In addition to supporting actors Tong Zhiling, Gao Shenglin, Jiang Shiyu, Sun Shengwu, and Li Shilin, Li's father-in-law Gao Qingkui also came along. According to Gao Qingkui, he was a popular actor ten years ago, famous throughout the north and south of the Yangtze River. Six years ago, he once cooperated with Kunling Zhang Guoyun to perform in the Golden Grand Theater. After the term expired, he returned north, and due to quitting smoking, his voice became ill. He couldn't utter a single word, so he couldn't re-present his great skills, and the audience couldn't help but regret it. This time, the Golden Grand Theater firmly invited Gao Ling to Shanghai to rehearse Gao-style masterpieces such as "Gifting a Silk Robe" and "Crying in the Qin Court" for his son-in-law, so he resolutely went south. The reporter met Gao Ling at the Cangzhou Hotel yesterday. Not only was he older than before, but he had also become a dumb voice, which made people feel unable to overcome the feeling of the past and present. According to Gao Ling, his son-in-law Shengzao has recently had an excellent voice, very similar to the heyday of Qingkui. Qingkui's early famous masterpieces have all been taught to Shengzao, so Shengzao has become Qingkui's successor. Gao Ling said with infinite emotion, showing a happy look, and expected that his son-in-law's art must be extraordinary. In addition, there is one more thing worth mentioning, that is, the Kunling Tong Zhiling, who came with Shengzao this time, has both beauty and talent, and has always been a rare talent among the rising Kun Dan. It is expected that Zhiling's performance this time will definitely become popular in Chun Shen (Shanghai), not letting Wu Suqiu monopolize the beauty in the past.

### Thirty Years in Film

— Wen Qin

Wallace Beery has devoted himself to the film industry for thirty years. In terms of qualifications, among all the stars in Hollywood today, there is only one Lionel Barrymore who can match him. However, his appeal is not absolutely due to his "old" age, and precisely because of his age, we can draw a conclusion: if he does not have superior acting skills—with enough power to attract the audience, then he would have been eliminated in the competitive process of this long thirty years. This great artist was born in Kansas City as the youngest of three sons of a police officer named Noppilei; he was diligent and did not want to study, and liked to be friends with railroad workers. Before entering the film industry, he had worked as a worker in a screw factory and as a lion tamer in a circus.

In June 1910, Wallace began to devote himself to the screen. At first, he specialized in comedy, but at that time, it was the heyday of Keystone, and he was at a loss. So, after starring in Behind The Door and gaining success, he switched to playing knight-like and humorous roles; he successively played in several silent films such as The Four Horsemen, The Three Musketeers, Robin Hood, and Richard the Lionheart. Later, due to environmental factors, he once again switched to comedy.

Transitioning to the sound era, Wallace Beery played two works that were then regarded as transcendent: The Big House and The Champ. And his rough style was also greatly praised. Under the pursuit of various companies, he was finally extended to MGM. Up to now, I don’t know how many films he has starred in, and each film has a surprising (box office appeal, which is really rare.
