### The French are Limiting Freight Transportation on the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway. Foreign Minister Wang Issues Important Statement. Japan's Demands Regarding the Sino-French Treaty are Baseless. If Japan Launches Armed Aggression in Vietnam, We Will Adopt Self-Defense Measures to Ensure Survival and Independence.

Chongqing: Regarding the Japanese threat to the French government to halt general freight transportation between China and Vietnam, Foreign Minister Wang issued an important statement today. The original text is as follows: "French Indochina, geographically linked to Kunming, China, has always maintained close relations. In terms of commerce and economic needs, we have benefited from mutual adjustments for many years. Now, Vietnam is particularly important as China's international transportation route. Trade between the New China and foreign countries, as well as China's own security, are greatly dependent on it. China and France have several treaties regarding French Indochina, the most recent being the 'Treaty on Relations between Vietnam and the Chinese Border Provinces' signed on May 16, 1930. According to the provisions of this treaty, France allows various goods to pass through Vietnam, including arms and ammunition. The Chinese government, considering the specific obligations undertaken by France, naturally has the right to demand that it fulfill its obligations and maintain Vietnam as an international trade route. However, in recent years, the Chinese government has not requested the passage of arms and ammunition through Vietnam, already making every possible effort to understand the difficulties faced by a friendly nation. Unfortunately, the Japanese government is going further, taking advantage of the situation to openly and covertly threaten the French government, forcing it to halt general transportation between China and Vietnam. The Chinese government cannot help but deeply regret France's failure to firmly refuse. Japan's demand aims to impose a blockade on a friendly nation, a blockade that is completely unfounded in both the Sino-French treaties and international law. The French government's failure to decisively reject Japan's demands will inevitably encourage Japan's acts of undermining peace in the Far East. The Chinese government cannot but be greatly concerned about this. The Chinese government is convinced that any act of military aggression by Japan in any region of Asia or the Pacific, regardless of the form it takes, is solely intended to use its aggression to achieve its fundamental goal of conquering China. It is particularly evident that if Japan occupies Vietnam, its aim will be none other than to seize French territory and inevitably take the route through Vietnam to attack China. Therefore, if Japan engages in acts of armed aggression in Vietnam and other places, the Chinese government, in order to maintain its survival and independence and to pursue its consistent anti-aggression policy, cannot but take all necessary self-defense measures under such circumstances due to Japan's coercion. This is hereby declared." (Dispatch of the 23rd)

Chongqing: After learning that the French authorities in Vietnam had accepted Japan's demand to halt freight transportation through Vietnam, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has lodged an urgent protest with the French authorities. (Reuters dispatch of the 23rd)

Chongqing: According to claims here, after Japan made a demand to French Indochina to immediately prohibit the transportation of arms from Vietnam to Chongqing, and at the same time, to allow Japanese inspectors to be dispatched to the border to monitor freight transportation, French Indochina immediately accepted it. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has therefore lodged an urgent protest with the Vietnamese authorities. (Reuters dispatch of the 23rd)

Tokyo: It was announced here last night that after France allowed the cessation of imports of strategically related raw materials into China, the Japanese government decided to dispatch twenty inspectors from both the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of the Army to reside in various transportation centers in French Indochina, such as Hanoi, Haiphong, and Lao Cai, to monitor goods transported to China and prohibit the import of major commodities into China, including iron, cotton, and railway materials. The detailed list will be decided tomorrow. The Franco-Japanese agreement will soon be implemented. (Associated Press dispatch of the 23rd)

Washington: The U.S. government, in this world of combat, must divide its attention among many aspects, such as assisting Britain in achieving victory for democracy in Europe, resisting any attack by any party on the omnipotent trade of the twenty-one American republics, and dealing with the threatening situation in the Far East. According to news reports, Japan has concentrated its naval forces near Vietnam. U.S. Secretary of State Hull refused to issue new comments on the U.S. Far East policy, but he mentioned to newspaper reporters the recent declaration of the United States' concern that the current situation in the Pacific should not be overturned. It is said that official news about the rumored concentration of the Japanese navy in the Hainan area has not yet been received. The U.S. government is clearly concerned about the possibility of the war spreading to the Far East. The "cartel" system currently being implemented in the Americas

(Note: This system is a union of manufacturers to maintain prices.) Although the main purpose is to cope with the trade offensive of omnipotent countries in Europe, this system will also be implemented with the same trade methods used in the East. The announcement of this cartel system coincides with the visit of Kato, the former Japanese special envoy to China, to many South American countries, and the subsequent meeting here with diplomatic representatives of Japanese countries in the Americas to discuss trade and other issues. This situation may have significant meaning. Kato will leave here for Tokyo in the next few days. The news that Song Ziwen, bearing an important mission, arrived in the United States by plane from Manila two days ago has aroused great attention here. Chinese sources here have not yet received news of Song's arrival. (Reuters dispatch of the 23rd)

Danjing: The newly appointed Japanese ambassador to the Scandinavian countries gave a speech yesterday, saying that there may be major changes in the Far East situation recently, mainly in Vietnam, and hoped that the war in China could be ended soon. (Haitong dispatch of the 23rd)

### Japan Pressures Britain, Situation in Hong Kong is Tense, Shenzhen and Shatoujiao are Occupied, Protests Filed Regarding Freight Transportation on the Burma Road

Hong Kong: Hong Kong residents are watching the border developments today. Five hundred Chinese refugees fled here yesterday to seek refuge. Many of the refugees were injured. One refugee died in a Hong Kong hospital last night due to injuries. The refugees claimed that although the Japanese army did not encounter any resistance, they indiscriminately shot at villagers. Recently, news from the border area claimed that the Japanese army was heading north along the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway to cut off what the Japanese claimed to be new supply lines. The area was garrisoned by the Japanese army last night. Some people here believe that the Japanese military actions along the border from Shenzhen to Shatoujiao and the concentration of Japanese transport ships in Nantou are Japan's beginning to exert pressure on Britain, hoping to block the Burma Road and prevent the import of military materials into China. They believe that the Japanese army deliberately carries out military actions on the border to conduct a demonstration movement towards Hong Kong. They also believe that the Japanese military actions will ultimately put forward strict demands to Britain to block the Burma Road, because after the Vietnamese authorities agreed to block the transportation route to China, the Burma Road is China's only "lifeline" for foreign relations in the southwest. However, the British military spokesperson here does not take the Japanese military concentration on the border seriously, because the Japanese army had notified the British military authorities in advance. The spokesperson continued that the purpose of the Japanese army occupying the area bordering the British colony is to eliminate Chinese guerrillas, so the spokesperson believes that there is no reason for terror. Reliable sources claim that the Japanese army landed in Nantou, northwest of Kowloon, and went straight to Shenzhen. A Japanese bomber bombed Shenzhen yesterday, killing one Chinese and injuring three. The "Ta Kung Pao" reported that 5,000 Japanese troops occupied the area from Shenzhen to Shatoujiao without encountering resistance. The "Ta Kung Pao" also reported that Japanese transport ships were concentrated in Nantou. (Associated Press dispatch of the 23rd)

Hong Kong: The situation in Hong Kong today is extremely tense, because millions of Chinese refugees are flocking here due to the Japanese army's occupation of the border areas. Among the refugees are many well-to-do workers who were engaged in reconstruction work in the border area a few days ago after the Japanese army withdrew. In addition, there are mostly ordinary villagers, carrying their luggage, carrying infants in swaddling clothes, and dragging their children into the country in a panic. Last night, the police and the army here took care of the refugees in the refugee camps in the pouring rain and were very busy, without rest all night. More than 5,000 people have now been settled in the refugee camps. This situation will inevitably cause a new problem for the newly established committee engaged in studying the problem of overcrowding in this area, and it wants to find ways to reduce the population in order to prevent the danger of epidemics. There are different reports on the number of Japanese soldiers active on the border, some saying only 800, some saying as many as 5,000, and according to earlier Japanese news and what the Japanese military authorities said, there are six teams of Japanese troops in the area. Observers estimate that there are about 3,000. At the same time, there is much news that the Japanese army intends to expand its combat range to Huizhou, and it is heard that a team of Japanese naval marines is currently concentrated in Bias Bay, which is believed to be for this attempt. However, the military authorities in Hong Kong have repeatedly stated today that there is no reason for alarm in this situation, and that even if the Japanese army occupies this area, the corner of Hong Kong is still safe. (Associated Press dispatch of the 23rd)

Hong Kong: At 4:00 pm on the 22nd, the Japanese army invaded Shenzhen from Nantou, with an unknown number of people. Refugees have retreated into the British leased territory. (Dispatch of the 22nd)

Guangzhou: Reuters has recently received semi-official Japanese news that Japan has filed a protest with the British regarding the transportation of various materials through Myanmar, and said that the Japanese army's concentration in Shenzhen has nothing to do with the above-mentioned protest. (Reuters dispatch of the 23rd)

Hong Kong: The situation around the British border today is as it was yesterday, but the British authorities are continuing to be on guard in order to cope with any possible accidents. Yesterday evening, it was estimated that there were 3,000 Japanese soldiers in the border area, and it is believed that more will continue to arrive. Although the authorities have reiterated assurances, observers believe that the Japanese actions are a prelude to protesting the supply of goods to Chongqing via the Burma Road. French Indochina has now developed the same situation. (Reuters dispatch of the 23rd)

Guangzhou: The Japanese side issued a statement on the military actions around the British leased territory, saying that the Japanese air force cooperated with the land army to bomb dozens of civilian ships carrying military materials. A large number of materials were found at the Pingmin (transliteration) station, 15 miles north of Shenzhen. It is not yet known whether the Japanese army will remain stationed in Shenzhen after clearing the Chinese guerrillas. (Reuters dispatch of the 23rd)

The Chinese Army Prepares a Fierce Counteroffensive

After the Japanese army took military action near Hong Kong, people generally feared that Hong Kong would be blockaded. Today, they received news that the Chinese army was preparing a fierce counteroffensive. The Japanese army moved along the Kowloon border from Shenzhen to Shatoujiao, and the Japanese army has concentrated in Nantou. All of these indicate that the Japanese army is attempting to prevent Britain from assisting China. The Burma Road, the channel for China to import arms, has almost become the indirect target of the Japanese army's actions. When Japanese officials answered questions, they declared that the Japanese army reoccupied Shenzhen because Hong Kong continued to supply China with arms and must be stopped. Hong Kong officials claimed that Hong Kong did not transport arms to China, and they pointed out that the Hong Kong authorities had strictly controlled the arms trade. A British military spokesperson here declared that the purpose of the Japanese army occupying the area near Kowloon was to attack Chinese guerrillas, "and there is no reason to be surprised." Moreover, Japanese officials notified the Hong Kong authorities before the Japanese army took action. According to an International News Agency reporter, the total number of Japanese troops concentrated near the Kowloon border is 3,000. Currently, there are only 600 Japanese troops in Shenzhen. It is expected that the Chinese army will carry out a counteroffensive. (International News Agency dispatch of the 23rd)

After the victory, the Chinese army safely returned to defense. (Dispatch of the 22nd)

### Japanese Army Invades Near Anbei, Suffers a Heavy Blow from the Chinese

Xingji: A part of the Japanese army in Suiyuan, riding in more than 30 cars and accompanied by 400 cavalry, invaded Zhangsanhao, Aqinhuhong (north of Anbei) from the Gobi on the morning of the 20th. Another part of the Japanese cavalry, more than 700, harassed Niupigou (northeast of Tailiang) and Haratutailiangbei. After the Chinese army counterattacked, many Japanese soldiers were killed. Fierce battles are still going on. (Dispatch of the 22nd)

Editorial

### Lessons from the International Turmoil

The "September 18th Incident" in 1931 was a signal that the world situation was turning from light to darkness. Since then, the international political situation has been deteriorating day by day. The evolution of this matter not only failed to conform to what the world expected, but also had the opposite effect. Almost every ending has increased the suffering of mankind; and the recent surrender of France is even more a soul-stirring scene. Taking the current situation as a starting point, we must know that it has been nearly ten years since we entered the era of tragedy!

In fact, during these ten years, it is not that there were no bright factors that existed and grew, nor that there were no forces gradually building up to resist the reactionary trend. Taking the recent situation as an example, although the European situation is in a very chaotic adversity, in the Far East, China's resistance war is even more glorious, standing as the mainstream of the anti-aggression struggle; and the United States, its various operations are also increasingly becoming more active and clear, developing in direct proportion to the international aggressive forces. However, these factors have failed to curb the expansion of the dark trend from the beginning, nor have they been able to prevent the deterioration of the international situation. This is not necessarily due to the lack of strength or the lack of application; mainly, it cannot but be attributed to the ambiguous understanding of certain people in the international community, which led to the delay of the opportunity; or even greedy for short-term gains, working for the tiger, so that even if the side representing justice and fairness has wise and intelligent measures, it is difficult to achieve the expected results; This allows those who believe in violence to take advantage of loopholes to satisfy their greed. Countless examples of such heartbreaking events can be found from 1931 to the present: Among them, the evil consequences caused by the so-called realism policy are even more obvious, and they have ultimately led to various tragedies in Europe. Evolving to the present, several large and small countries in Europe have been destroyed, and people's beliefs and reason have also been strongly attacked; but the lessons of facts do not seem to have fully played the role of shocking the deaf; that is, those political mistakes in the past have not yet been thoroughly eliminated, and even on several major issues, they are still inevitably following the footsteps of the past. For example, recently, President Roosevelt's measures to deal with the European situation, strengthening the use of government agencies, are still troubled by those pedantic politicians with endless disputes. For example, as the frequent reports in recent days show, the path taken by Britain and France to deal with the Far East is still a continuation of the previous realism policy. From Europe to the Far East, from the beginning to the final moment of life and death, some people's understanding of the current situation still cannot be matched with the actual urgent tasks, which is a very regrettable thing.

Regarding the situation in the United States. I firmly believe that the current difficulties are only the current phenomenon. I firmly believe that there are many insightful people in that country. In this difficult time, they will never be misled by a part of parochial views and mislead the future of the country. What we want to simply state is that people must truly recognize the experience of France's failure this time; democracy is a commendable system, but it cannot exist alone apart from the entire destiny of the country. The United States and France are both the main sources of democratic politics, but France's over-decentralized political system and the disputes among countless parties have formed a fatal wound that hinders unity and hinders revitalization. After this defeat, this political system will almost sink with France's past glory. This is a painful current lesson that should provide a good lesson for the American people. Some people say: With President Roosevelt's talent and ambition, if he were not constrained by the limitations of the American political system, not only would his personal achievements be unlimited, but the whole world would also benefit greatly. This is an inference obtained under a hypothetical premise that cannot be established in fact; although it is not worthy of much consideration in fact, this view is worthy of deep thought in meaning.

As for the situation in the Far East, although Japan's ambitions are extremely strong, its strength is not enough to satisfy its ambitions. If Japan really has the determination to fight at all costs to fulfill its desire to advance south, then it should have already launched something, and it will not stick to the policy of non-participation and only shout empty slogans to this day. However, even if Japan's war preparations are insufficient, it is by no means something that can be satisfied by making minor concessions. Just look at the fact that the situation in the Tianjin Concession has improved slightly due to the British concessions, and Hong Kong has encountered major threats; even if Vietnam accepts Japan's demand to block the Chinese border, it has not reduced Japan's threat of deploying a large army. Britain and France are in a difficult situation in Europe, and their concessions in the Far East are out of necessity; but these measures only show their servility and are in vain. Because on the one hand, it violates its own promises, corrodes China's rights, and conflicts with the US measures on the Far East; on the other hand, in fact, it cannot obtain the real effect of protecting its own rights and interests; in short, it is useless to both people and oneself. The world has had an illusion about Japan: thinking that a little concession can promote the rise of moderate elements and restrain the restless actions of the radical faction; in fact, even in the past, it was just a misconception; under the current situation, it is only enough to stimulate the greed of the radical faction, and even the effect of temporary survival cannot be achieved.

The situation in the Far East is not as complicated as that in Europe. China's resistance war and the US sanctions are the main factors for stabilizing the Far East. All measures related to the Far East should be used around this center. If you abandon the smooth path and do not take it, it is objectively equivalent to fueling the flames and using soup to stop boiling, and it will only create chaos and darkness like the European situation. I believe that the powers should not be so ignorant as to do this. The world chaos has reached the final juncture. I hope that the world can have a thorough awakening.

Huntziger stood up and declared in a heavy tone that the French government had decided to sign the draft of the armistice agreement, but before signing, he wished to express his personal opinion: "As France decides to abandon combat here, it hopes that in the Calais negotiations, Germany can have a spirit that allows the two neighboring countries to coexist peacefully." Huntziger then declared to German Chief Representative General Keitel: "All soldiers should know the limits of France's ability to bear the burden. It is hoped that French soldiers will not regret the government's decision."

French Colonial Authorities Oppose Surrender Terms

London: The Ministry of Information announced that London has not been able to verify the news of the French signing an armistice agreement transmitted by the American and German sides tonight, as well as the claim from Bordeaux that the armistice agreement has already been signed. It is heard that the French government has submitted a counter-proposal to France. At the same time, London has received news from all parts of the French Empire declaring loyalty to the motherland. This shows that the sentiment in the French colonies is strongly in favor of continuing the war. The governors of the colonies and the commanders of the French forces have expressed their willingness to fight alongside the British Empire against aggression. One governor said that he would never accept the terms of surrender, and other governors said that if the French central government surrendered, they intended to resist to the end, and were willing to be under British command if necessary. (June 22nd, Reuters)

London: According to responsible figures here, although the signing of the armistice agreement by the French government has terminated the organized resistance of the French forces at home, there is still an encouraging sign, namely, the spirit of the French colonies is very heroic. In Syria, General Mittelhauser, Commander-in-Chief of the French forces stationed in the Levant, has announced his determination to continue the war. The Governor-General of Vietnam has declared that he will never lower his national flag. The Director of Tunisia insists on continuing the war. The military and civilian authorities in other regions such as Morocco, Senegal, Cameroon, and Djibouti have also made guarantees of loyalty and support for the war. The British government has prepared to take the necessary financial measures so that each French colony can fulfill its responsibilities. As Prime Minister Churchill said, Britain's goal is to completely restore France's capital and overseas territories. (June 23rd, Reuters)

### Churchill Expresses Sorrow That France Accepts German Terms; Appeals to French Outside Enemy Power

London: Prime Minister Churchill issued a statement today, saying that the British government was shocked and saddened to learn that the French government in Bordeaux had accepted the conditions proposed by the German side. They believe that any French government that possesses freedom, independence, and constitutional sovereignty cannot succumb to these or similar conditions. If these conditions are accepted by all the French, it will not only place France in the hands of the German and Italian dictators, but will also extend to the entirety of the French Empire. Not only will the people of France be oppressed and forced to work against their allies, but the land of France will be used as a means of attacking its allies with the consent of the Bordeaux government. All the resources of the French Empire and the French Navy will quickly fall into the hands of the enemy to serve their purposes. The British government firmly believes that no matter what happens, they will be able to continue the war on land, sea, and air and achieve victory. When Britain wins, it will assist the will of the French people regardless of the actions of the Bordeaux government. Britain's victory is the only possible hope for restoring the greatness of France and the freedom of its people. Currently, the brave people of other countries invaded by the Nazis are determined to fight for freedom, so the British government calls on all French people outside the enemy's power to rise up and help the British government carry out its work, so as to achieve more accurate and rapid results. The British government now appeals to all French people everywhere to fully assist the forces of liberation. This force is very great, and if it can be used faithfully and resolutely, it will surely overcome everything. (June 23rd, Reuters)

### General de Gaulle Encourages French to Fight; Takes Charge of Military Organization Work in Britain

London: General de Gaulle, who served as Director of Tactics in the Reynaud cabinet, said in a French broadcast that the French government had not surrendered to the enemy, and that an armistice would amount to enslavement. The impact of the armistice conditions will be the surrender of our weapons, the complete occupation of all of France, and the reduction of the French government to a German and Italian appendage. Many French people will not accept these conditions. French people should continue to struggle, and everything that can be gathered in the army and in the methods of producing military equipment should be organized as much as possible where possible. I am in Britain to take charge of this national work. I have invited the leaders, Daladier, and French soldiers from the army, navy, and air force to contact me. I ask the French people to follow me. Long live Free, Glorious, and Independent France! (June 23rd, Reuters)

### London Observer Reviews the Future of the Anglo-German War; Air Power and Sea Power Are Decisive Factors; British Military Strength Is Increasing

London: The Observer published an article by Gavin, entitled "Britain's Great War," which stressed the importance of air power and sea power in the future war for the British Isles. The article stated: "We have reached a battle of life and death. This war will test our entirety with firepower and prove our spirit. We will choose between invincible resistance and complete conquest by Nazi power. In one sense, we are now isolated, and in another sense, we are not. We have the sympathy of most of the people in the world, and most of its resources depend on sea power to obtain them. The longer we persist, the greater the actual assistance brought by the overseas empire and the United States will be. At the same time, the naval, land, and air forces we possess within these islands are stronger than ever before. As far as defending Britain is concerned, this military strength has not decreased due to the disasters suffered by the Low Countries and France, but has increased." The article mentioned Churchill's speech in the House of Commons and the report of the Special Consultant arguing that Britain should continue to fight, and then continued: "We must first concentrate on the necessary conditions he estimated. This is as clear as the sun. Adding air superiority to sea power is enough to form victory. There is nothing else that forms victory. Unless our air defenses have been destroyed, we cannot be defeated in the several months of persistent crisis. If Britain gains control of the skies a little later, it will be able to hold the winning ticket. We now have a new expeditionary force in the country, and have been through the experience of the Great War. The British expeditionary force in its land of origin is a priceless treasure. In addition, there are Canadian and Australian divisions who will coexist and die with Britain here. Are these things not enough to stir the blood of every man and every woman, and to call up the new army that is backing them up? Behind the new army is the local volunteer defense force. While our pilots are engaged in aerial combat, Britain will never be invaded by foreign troops at the end of summer. Why is this? Because its navy cannot be separated from all the rest. If Germany wants to attack any part of our land, it must do so with sufficient military force, and our sea power is sufficient to prevent Germany from safely crossing the sea with a sufficient large army to reach our shores."

### Speculation in London on the Terms of the Franco-German Armistice Agreement

London: Some quarters here believed last night that if the French government succumbed to the harsh peace treaty of Germany and Italy, another new French government would be established outside France.

### Swiss Newspaper Comments on the Armistice Agreement

Geneva: Newspapers here reported that treaties based on force depend on the maintenance of force. The Treaty of Versailles, based on force, has now been completely shattered along with the armistice agreement in Compiègne. The Treaty of Versailles violated justice and contained self-destructive factors from the beginning, and politicians after the war failed to revise it in time. France has adopted this attitude and is now suffering the consequences. It is not surprising that Germany is depriving France of its military potential. The preface to the current armistice agreement does not have the meaning of retaliation. (June 26th, Reuters)

### Saying of Tense Relations Between Soviet Union and Germany, Moscow Solemnly Denies, Soviet Troops Stationed in Baltic Sea Nations Only Twenty Divisions, Chief Commander of Estonia Replaced

Moscow Since the Soviet army entered the Baltic Sea countries, rumors have sprung up, claiming that the Soviet army's strength of one hundred or one hundred and fifty divisions has been concentrated on the borders of Lithuania and Germany. It is also said that the concentration of these troops is due to (1) the Soviet Union's resentment of Germany's success in Western Europe, (2) reflecting the deterioration of Soviet-German relations, and (3) proving that the Soviet Union intends to put pressure on Germany. Recently, the above-mentioned rumors have been found daily in newspapers of the United States, Japan, Britain, France, Turkey, and Sweden. TASS is now authorized by the government to declare that the rumors are completely inconsistent with the facts and are obviously absurd. In fact, the Soviet troops stationed in the Baltic Sea countries are not one hundred to one hundred and fifty divisions, but only eighteen to twenty divisions. Moreover, these troops are not stationed on the German-Lithuanian border, but are scattered throughout the Baltic Sea countries. Their purpose is to ensure the implementation of mutual assistance treaties between the Soviet Union and these countries, and there is absolutely no intention to put pressure on Germany. The Soviet authorities believe that those who spread the rumors have a special purpose: to undermine German-Soviet relations. These gentlemen are using their dreams to fabricate facts, but they do not know that since the signing of the non-aggression pact, the friendly relations between the Soviet Union and Germany cannot be shaken by any rumors. This kind of relationship is based on the fundamental interests of the Soviet Union and Germany, and is by no means a temporary friendship. (TASS dispatch on the 23rd)

### U.S.-Japan Relations Will Worsen, Stimson's Appointment as Secretary of War Attacked by Japanese Newspapers

Tokyo This morning, Japanese newspapers unanimously attacked the U.S. President's appointment of Stimson as Secretary of War, saying that this move will make U.S.-Japan relations increasingly worse. The Japan Times stated that the person selected by President Roosevelt is an enemy of Japan's Far East policy. Choosing such personnel is a clumsy method of revising the policy toward Europe. The Nichinichi Shimbun recalled Stimson's attitude toward Japan's occupation of Manchuria in 1931 when he was Secretary of State, saying that President Roosevelt's selection of such personnel shows the attitude of the United States. The Hochi Shimbun stated that Stimson's appointment as Secretary of War is a sign that the United States is preparing to deal with Japan with "military diplomacy." Miyako Shimbun, in commenting on the problem of U.S.-Japan relations, stated that if the United States really wants to improve relations with Japan, it should show its sincerity, conclude a treaty of commerce with Japan, and abandon its policy of being friendly with General Chiang Kai-shek.

To confirm the above news, a reporter from this newspaper drove to the area last night to investigate. When the car reached the intersection of Avenue Petain and Haig Road, it was suddenly stopped by a street patrolman. When asked about the reports of the Japanese and puppet troops invading the Xujiahui refugee area and the temporary relocation of the police station, shopkeepers nearby confirmed that it was true, and said that the trend of residents relocating had subsided slightly, and everything was quiet.

Japanese Military Defenses in Shanghai Suburbs Vacant

Over the past week, rumors have been rife in Shanghai that soldiers fully equipped with weapons have arrived in the areas surrounding Shanghai from Nanjing and other places. To clarify the actual situation, a reporter from the Daguan News Agency inquired with residents in the Shanghai suburbs. Currently, the Japanese military defenses in the four suburbs of Shanghai are still very vacant. Although some soldiers have arrived in the western suburbs of Shanghai, their numbers are very limited and they are stationed along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway. In the Nanshi area, only the so-called "Peace and National Salvation Army" drills are held daily in the former Ximen Public Sports Ground, but the number of people is only about one hundred, and they are all unarmed. Although there are traces of Japanese soldiers and tanks at the Japanese military police headquarters on Minguo Road, Xinjiao Street, and south of Jinji Bridge, this has been a common sight for years and is not worth emphasizing.

Situation Quiet on Roads Built Across the Boundary

To understand the actual situation in the area where roads have been built across the boundary in western Shanghai, a reporter from the Shangguang News Agency drove to inspect the area yesterday and found that there was no tense atmosphere. The Italian troops stationed in the Route Robert area were also carrying out patrol duties as usual, no different from before the declaration of war by Italy. At the intersection of Yuyuan Road and Kaixuan Road, a bunker was built by the British army, with British soldiers stationed inside and a British flag flying on top. The section of Anhe Temple Road along the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway is lined with wire mesh parallel to the railway. The situation is very quiet. The intersection of Lujia Road and Kaixuan Road is still guarded by two armed British soldiers standing at a guard post. The junction of the south with the French Concession is covered with barbed wire, and French soldiers are stationed there, with the British and French flags flying in the air, and the atmosphere is quite relaxed.

### Nanshi Refugee Area Dispersing Refugees; Each Person Given One Month's Ration; Distribution Begins Today

The issue of dispersing the refugees in the Nanshi refugee area has now been completely resolved. In addition to the elderly and weak who will continue to be supported by the Xinpu Yutang, 20,000 of the younger and stronger people will each be given one month's ration, which will be officially distributed by the Post-Disaster Relief Committee starting today, with distribution expected to be completed by the end of the month. Half of the funding for the ration is borne by the Refugee Association, and half is provided by charitable lottery tickets. The following is the announcement issued yesterday by Xie Shibai, the acting executive committee member of the area: Announcement regarding the matter of distributing rations. The association has been carrying out relief work for Chinese refugees for almost three years, and the amount of relief funds distributed each year is quite large. Now, due to the depletion of funds, it is impossible to continue. Before leaving Shanghai, Executive Committee Member Rao convened a meeting and decided to stop providing rations on June 20 and immediately disperse those who are registered. Subsequently, at the request of Director Gu, and out of compassion for the refugees, all rations have been extended to the end of this month, and each person is allowed to receive one month's ration as a dispersal fund. In addition to separately announcing the distribution method, this announcement is hereby issued to inform all refugees to comply with the order to disband and seek a livelihood. This is earnestly hoped. This is the announcement. Seal of Xie Shibai, Acting Executive Committee Member.

### Sale of Coal Briquettes at Discount Prices Expires Today; Meeting to Be Held Tomorrow to Discuss Continuation

The sixth phase of the sale of coal briquettes at discount prices, organized by the Shanghai Coal Briquette Industry Association, began on the 14th of this month. A total of 49 discount sales points were set up in the two concessions.

At that time, the sale of coal briquettes at discount prices and how to suppress the market price of coal briquettes will be discussed in detail.

### Shanghai French Community Holds Meeting; Firmly Requests Continued Resistance; Telegram Sent to French Government Expressing Attitude; Ready to Use Life and Property as Support

Havas News Agency, Shanghai: The French community in Shanghai recently sent a telegram to the French government stating, "The French community in Shanghai held a meeting today initiated by the Veterans Association, and immediately passed a resolution.

On the spot, a telegram was unanimously passed to the French government requesting continued resistance and strengthening the unity of the Allied countries. At that time, the meeting was led by Eglé, chairman of the French Veterans Association, who read the telegram to the French government. The audience expressed their support for continued resistance and guaranteed that the entire French community in Shanghai was willing to provide all manpower and resources at the government's disposal.

Consul General Recounts Glorious War Achievements

Subsequently, French Consul General Orin made a brief speech, stating, "Recalling the First World War, during the Battle of Verdun, the French people resolutely resisted with an indomitable spirit and finally won the final victory.

### Flour Mills Decide to Operate as Usual; Solely for Local Sale; Aiming to Reduce the Severity of the Food Shortage; But All Losses Must Be Recovered from the Selling Price

The Shanghai Chinese flour milling industry stated that after the price of rice soared, flour became the staple food for the common people. Recent sales have surged from 3,000-5,000 bags to over 10,000 bags. However, the industry is facing the risk of being forced to shut down due to the depletion of imported wheat, the obstruction of new wheat, and the lack of raw materials. This would not only affect the industry itself but also impact the livelihood and security of the entire city. The industry reported to the municipal authorities and appealed to all sectors of society, but there was no concrete solution in practice. Therefore, yesterday, a general meeting was convened on the second floor of the Fuxin Flour Company on Jiangxi Road to discuss remedies. More than ten representatives from various factories, including Fufeng, Fuxin, Huafeng, and Xinlao, attended.

Relationship Between Wheat Prices and the Flour Industry

The following resolutions were made: (1) Regarding the proposal to supply the city to the greatest extent possible, it was resolved that the current amount of actual consumption would be supplied as usual, and all wholesalers and hoarders would be stopped from purchasing. (2) Regarding the proposal to restrict flour merchants from excessively raising prices, it was resolved to forward to all flour merchants that they must not raise the selling price beyond the wholesale price plus a reasonable commission. (3) and (4) Regarding the proposals to start receiving wheat and to send personnel from Zhuangpai to purchase wheat, it was resolved that, in the face of the adverse environment, the distribution should be temporarily suspended. Since it was difficult to initially lower the price of wheat to cover the cost of selling flour, it was decided to start purchasing from grain merchants and brokers at an increased fee. (5) and (6) Regarding the discussion of the proposals to suspend operations to wait for an opportunity and to increase the price of flour, it was resolved that, on the one hand, the mills would endure the difficulties and continue to operate to ensure the livelihoods of the workers and the preservation of their own property rights, and also to alleviate the severity of the city's food shortage. On the other hand, all losses would be reasonably factored into the selling price in the city to ensure that both parties are taken care of. Otherwise, if operations were suspended, it would be detrimental to the manufacturers, merchants, and citizens. It is reported that the resolutions made by the industry will be implemented immediately. Therefore, the rumors that the flour mills will suspend operations and reduce the supply can be dispelled, and the public's panic can be avoided.

Grain Committee to Hold Plenary Meeting Today

Recently, the price of rice in Shanghai has been soaring due to speculators taking advantage of the tense situation in Annam and the lack of rain. They have been raising the prices of rice that they had already transported to Shanghai at low prices, resulting in a surge in rice prices and instances of people rushing to buy rice. This is not only making it difficult for residents to maintain their livelihoods but also affecting social security. According to a reporter from Pingming News Agency who inquired with the Municipal Council, the Municipal Council's Grain Committee, in view of this situation and in order to stabilize the people's food supply, has scheduled a plenary committee meeting for 2:15 pm today (24th) to discuss important matters related to grains such as rice, wheat, and flour within the concession, and to come up with public methods that are sufficient to deter unscrupulous merchants and benefit the people. However, according to the opinions of the general public, in view of the fact that past price limits have been merely nominal and have not yielded real benefits, it is deeply hoped that the authorities will strictly enforce punishments and offer rewards for reporting illegal price increases, so that the price of rice will not be manipulated and can be suppressed.

### Whether the Wenyi Liner Will Suspend Sailings Is Still Under Consideration; There Is Actually No Need to Suspend Sailings

The Japanese side has repeatedly obstructed navigation to Wenzhou from Shanghai under the pretext of blockading the Oujiang River. Last month, they issued a warning to the British Consulate to prohibit British and American ships from entering the Oujiang River. Later, they restricted German and Italian ships over 100 tons from sailing to Wenzhou to the German and Italian Consulates. British and American ships, out of respect for international navigation rights, did not heed the warning, so all ships have continued to sail as usual. After receiving the notification from the Japanese side, the German and Italian Consulates notified the shipping companies accordingly. According to a reporter from Xinsheng News Agency, the rumor that the Baoli liner of the Italian Hua Yanghang was ordered to suspend sailing to Wenzhou yesterday was due to the above reasons. Currently, the German and Italian liners sailing between Shanghai and Wenzhou include the German Hanah, Feikang, and Haikang; and the Italian Baoli, Sant'Anna, Changde, and Maberria. Among them, only the Hanah, Feikang, and Baoli liners are over 200 tons. It is reported that the shipping companies have received the notification, but since there is actually no need to suspend sailings, whether to suspend them in the future is still under consideration. As for the other liners, they do not conflict with the restrictions and will continue to sail as usual. The Italian liner Maberria arrived in Shanghai yesterday and is scheduled to continue sailing to Wenzhou tomorrow. Therefore, there is no impact on the entire Shanghai-Wenzhou shipping.

### Reuters Managing Director Returns to England After Completing Official Duties

Investigation into Hotel Embezzlement of Refugee Donations; The general manager of the Dafang Hotel on Zhengjia Muqiao Street in the French Concession, Mr. Shen Yongkang, embezzling refugee donations has aroused considerable public attention. It is heard that after the hotel industry proposed collecting refugee donations from passengers, hotels in the French Concession, due to certain reasons, have always allowed passengers to donate voluntarily. However, in order to prevent abuses, in addition to handing over the funds to the Refugee Association, any surplus is donated by the hotels themselves to other charities. Dafang Hotel has also adopted this method. The sudden occurrence of this incident is said to be due to other reasons. It is reported that Shen has collected evidence and will make it public in order to clarify the truth.

Yesterday, the prices of fresh pork in the British and French Concessions of Shanghai rose again, with different prices. It is generally believed that the sudden rise in pork prices was obviously due to Japanese manipulation. According to people in the pork industry, the supply of goods here has been greatly reduced, and those in the pork industry in the two concessions are practically not allowed to trade at the "Livestock Market" in Hongkou. The handlers in the Hongkou "Market" must demand tips, so the cost of pork is high and the selling price increases accordingly. However, according to official claims from the Public Concession, it is indeed a fact that the supply of pigs has been lacking recently, but foreign goods will be available soon, and the selling price of fresh meat is expected to fall.

### US Commercial Counselor in China Returns to Shanghai After Completing Duties in Chongqing

### Provincial Security Team Advances East; Has Broken Through the Taihu Lake Area; Deputy Commander Cai Runqi Leads Troops Out of the Mountains; Dingshan Completely Recovered; More Than 1,000 Japanese Killed

According to people from Wuxi who have come to Shanghai, the former Jiangnan Advance Army originally operated in the area of Suxi Cheng Yu. They were frequently attacked by the Japanese and puppet forces. Since being ordered to reorganize into the Provincial Security Team and entering the mountains for training, more than a year has passed. It is learned that the troops, led by Deputy Commander Cai Runqi, advanced east and engaged in a large-scale positional battle with the Japanese army in the Dingshan area. The two sides were locked in a stalemate for two months, and after several assaults, more than 1,000 Japanese were killed, and Dingshan was completely recovered. Cai then took advantage of the victory to pursue the enemy and broke through Taihu Lake. In the Zhouqiao area of the Xiyi Road, they encountered a large Japanese reinforcement and immediately ambushed them, destroying more than ten trucks and killing hundreds of Japanese. Later, they encountered Japanese and puppet troops in Yangshuyuan, Wuxi, and fought fiercely for four days. The small branch of Japanese and puppet troops collapsed and retreated. Now a part of Cai's troops has been transferred to the designated area. The Japanese and puppet forces, hearing that Cai led his troops to return, and in view of his past combat capabilities and the current strong strength and complete equipment, are extremely alarmed.

### Zhejiang Province Lifts Rice Ban; Scope of Lifting Still Being Inquired

After the relief association of seven counties in Shaoxing residing in Shanghai requested Zhejiang Province to lift the rice ban in order to provide relief to the rice shortage in Shaoxing, it is learned that Zhejiang Province's reply telegram arrived in Shanghai on the 21st, approving the lifting of the rice ban. However, the association, unable to understand whether this only refers to relief rice or also allows merchants to purchase freely, inquired again on the 21st. The association stated that if Zhejiang Province's lifting of the rice ban is limited to relief rice, the association will immediately send personnel with funds to purchase rice from Zhejiang Province to provide relief to Shaoxing. If the telegram approves rice merchants to freely purchase and transport rice from Jiangxi, the purchase can be entrusted to local traders. The association must first advance a large sum of money. The association believes that, given the tense situation in Vietnam, the purchase of foreign rice is not easy and the price is high, so it requested the provincial government to lift the rice ban. Now that it has been approved, it is expected that the rice situation in Shaoxing can be slightly alleviated with the cooperation of the government and the people.

Silk and Dyeing Industries

The Shanghai Silk and Satin Dyeing Industry Association, in view of the fact that the source of rice for Shaoxing and Xiaoshan is running out, and the unprecedented drought has led to starvation everywhere, has each made donations at the general meeting of members on the 10th, which was extremely enthusiastic. Therefore, the 11th board meeting decided to establish a Shaoxing-Xiaoshan Emergency Relief Committee, and proposed that the association's member factories and workshops deduct 2% of their operating income each month as a regular relief donation until the disaster situation is alleviated. A general meeting of members was held at 7 pm yesterday (22nd) at the association's premises in Dean Lane, North Shanxi Road.

Transporting Rice to Zidong

Pudong, Nanhui, and Fengxian have always been rice-producing areas. Due to the prolonged drought, rice prices rose slightly. However, since the recent rainfall in the four suburbs of Shanghai, the panic over the severe drought has long been eliminated. However, the recent rice prices are still similar to those in Shanghai, because local unscrupulous merchants colluded with Ding Xishan's puppet troops to forcibly purchase rice from Pudong at a price of 30 to 40 yuan per dan and transport it to the Xiaoshan area of Zidong to make huge profits.

### Lawyers Association Plans to Offer Group Life Insurance; Circular Already Sent to All Members; Will Be Implemented If Approved

The Shanghai Lawyers Association, with a large membership of approximately 1,200, and an average age of under 40, has an annual mortality rate that is not precisely statistically known, but is estimated to be around 24 people per year. However, most members do not pay attention to savings, leading to poverty after death, even if [they have the help of friends].

Rising Cost of Living

Everyone's finances are often stretched, and even if they are willing to contribute, the amount is limited. Lawyer Xu Ziliang, a member of the association's standing committee, in order to remedy this deficiency, advocated offering a group life insurance policy to members and submitted a plan to the association's 54th board meeting for approval. Circulars have been sent to all members to seek their opinions. If the majority approves, it can be implemented. The main points of the group insurance plan are as follows:

(1) Insurance Type: Whole life insurance, meaning that if the insured person dies for any reason (other than accidental causes such as suicide or assassination), the policy will be mature and the compensation will be paid immediately, so that the funds can be used for compensation purposes. The payment period is longer and the premium is cheaper than savings insurance. (2) Insurance Amount: To be determined by the Group Insurance Committee, but it will be 1,000 yuan. (3) Insured Persons and Age: All members of the association must fully join the insurance, and there are no restrictions on age. Since they are members of the association, they should all enjoy the benefits of insurance and there should be no discrimination based on age. (4) Premiums: The association currently has more than 1,200 members, and the average age is under 40. Although there are no precise statistics on the annual mortality rate, based on memories, in recent years, the number of members who have died from natural causes has averaged no more than 24 per 1,000 people per year. According to this plan, the association will have to pay approximately 24,000 yuan in compensation each year. If this amount is shared by 1,200 people, each person will only be responsible for 20 yuan per year, which is 1 yuan and 6 jiao and 7 fen per month. Therefore, it is proposed to collect an insurance premium of 1 yuan and 7 jiao per person per month, which will result in an annual insurance premium of 24,480 yuan. If this amount is added to the interest, even if the mortality rate of members exceeds the above figures in the future, the association will not suffer a huge loss.

### Robbery of Taxi; Still Not Found This Morning

At approximately 9:07 pm last night, two customers, a man wearing a gray suit and appearing to be about 24 or 25 years old, accompanied by a woman of similar age, hailed a taxi at the Tielai Motor Company's branch at the intersection of Yuyuan Road and Jing'an Temple Road. The driver, Wang Er (from Yangzhou, 47 years old), drove the car, license number 12051, and was ordered to drive to [a certain] Garden. The three people entered and toured for about twenty minutes. They then came out and ordered the driver to drive to Avenue Haig. The man inside then pulled out a pistol and ordered the taxi driver, Wang Er, to leave the car, and the car sped away. Afterwards, Wang Er took a public bus back and reported the car robbery to the Jing'an Temple Police Station. As of 2 am this morning, the car had not been found.

### Transportation Conditions Between Shanghai and Chongqing

Since the start of the war of resistance, many residents of the isolated island have gone to the inland areas to serve in the army. A reporter from Datong News Agency has specifically recorded the transportation conditions from Shanghai to Chongqing as follows: Take a ship from Shanghai to Ningbo, then take a steamship to Jiangkou, then to Xikou, then take a car to Yuhua, and then take a train to Yingze on the next day, then take a car to Hengyang (passing through Nancheng, Ningdu, Ji'an, Jiehualong, etc.). From Hengyang, take a train to Guilin, then take a car to Liuzhou (Hengyang can originally be reached directly by train, since the fall of Nanning, it has been suddenly blocked, travelers can inquire about the route at the time of travel). From Liuzhou, take a car to Guiyang, and then take a car directly from Guiyang to Chongqing (there was originally a waterway from Guilin to Chongqing, but the fighting in Guanchang is currently fierce and it is impossible to pass through). There are two problems for travel today: one is the scarcity of vehicles, and the other is the heavy military transport. The journey takes about 20 days, and the travel cost is 350 yuan (including food and accommodation).

### The Meibao Printing Press Was Thrown a Sulfur Bomb Yesterday; Thugs Impersonated Detectives and Sneaked In; Explosion Put Out Quickly

However, it was quickly put out by the staff of the press with fire extinguishers. After receiving the news, the police sent detectives to investigate and took the bomb back to the police station for inspection. It is reported that the bomb was a new type of iron bomb with multiple holes, and the gunpowder had not yet exploded.

Zhao Chuqiao from Haimen, aged fifty, residing in a bungalow in Zhaofeng Garden, Sujiajiao, at the end of Yu Yuan Road in western Shanghai, used to be a leader in the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau's Detective Squad and a detective in the French Concession. After leaving his post, he moved to western Shanghai and widely recruited disciples, so he was quite influential there.

### Trademark Infringement Lawsuit: Tianchu Sues Xiangyuan, Verdict Scheduled

Monosodium glutamate

The "MSG" flavoring powder produced by Tianchu MSG Factory has been on the market for many years and has been registered with various competent authorities. Recently, the company discovered that a similar product named "Wei Jing" was being sold in the city, manufactured by the Xiangyuan Factory opened by Liu Xiangyuan of Yongren, No. 15 Zunde Lane, Xiamen Road. The color, pattern, and style of the iron cans used for the Wei Jing were almost completely copied from the MSG style. Therefore, the Tianchu Factory entrusted lawyers Wang Yaotang and Xian Xingzhong to investigate with the Trademark Bureau whether the Wei Jing had been registered. The reply stated that it had not been legally registered and could be prosecuted according to the law.

The estate of over 400,000 yuan was managed separately by his son Wang Yizhi (Ningwa's uncle) and his grandson Wang Jingren (Ningwa's brother). Wang Ningwa feared that her inheritance would be encroached upon, so she recently hired lawyer Shen Xingxia to file a lawsuit in the First Special Court's Civil Court, requesting confirmation of her one-sixth inheritance right to the entire estate of Wang Yonglin and his wife. She also requested that the defendants Wang Yizhi and Wang Jingren hand over 600-700 mu of land and houses and cash that they each received as gifts during the separation in 1919, as well as 49 mu of dowry land and 10,000 gold coins that Gu Wangzhengan (Wang Yizhi's sister) received when she got married, and include them in Wang Yonglin's estate for equal distribution. Furthermore, the hundreds of mu of land for Wang Yonglin's retirement, the shares of Jihong and other pawnshops, and tens of thousands of yuan of shares of Zhengxiang Qianzhuang, along with deposits in various banks and more than 20 boxes, should also be divided into one-sixth. After receiving the lawsuit, the court summoned both parties for a hearing yesterday. Both parties appointed lawyers to appear in court. First, lawyer Shen Xingxia, representing the plaintiff Wang Ningwa, stated the facts and reasons for the lawsuit, and said that the defendant had once offered more than 20,000 yuan for reconciliation, but it was too far from the amount that the plaintiff should inherit, so the reconciliation failed. Then, the lawyer representing the defendants Wang Jingren and others replied that Wang Yonglin's estate had been distributed by himself during his lifetime and could not be changed at present. Then, Shen Dizhuang, the manager of Zhengxiang Qianzhuang, testified that Wang Yonglin had no deposits in the bank. Lawyer Shen Xingxia then presented evidence, and Shen Dizhuang admitted that Wang Yonglin had 20,000 yuan in deposits, but most of it had been withdrawn. The court said to both parties that the case was about a family dispute, and reconciliation was the best way, so it was announced that the date would be changed and witnesses would be called again for questioning.

### A Street Vendor Impersonates Others to Deceive and Obtain Goods: Fortunately, He Was Detained and Interrogated

### Letter to the Editor

To the Editor: The news in your newspaper for several days that Shen Yongkang, the general manager of Dafang Hotel on Zhengjia Bridge Street, embezzled refugee donations and was fined 5,000 yuan is absolutely untrue. Although I am a shareholder of Dafang, I only serve as a resident member of the board of directors and have never held the position of general manager. Moreover, Dafang's internal organization does not have the title of general manager. The highest authority is the board of directors elected by the shareholders' meeting. All matters related to business must be approved by the board of directors before they can be implemented. No individual can be in charge. As for the use of donations, it is also decided by the board of directors. Even if I am unscrupulous, how dare I take such a great risk and tamper with it? The news reports are obviously deliberately slanderous and spread this kind of atmosphere. In addition to starting an investigation and publishing the use of donations, I would like to briefly describe the situation and hope that you will correct it to clarify the facts. I am very grateful. Sincerely, Shen Yongkang, June 23rd.

### The World Student Service Association Informs Chinese Students that Aid to China Will Not Be Suspended Due to the European War: Universities in Thirty-Seven Countries Will Always Be a Backstop

(Hong Kong Correspondence) The Geneva-based World Student Service Association, organized by educators from universities around the world, has expressed deep sympathy for China's war of resistance and is helping university students in the war zones or occupied areas in China. To show that they will not stop helping due to their own difficulties, they sent letters to universities across China, expressing stronger support in the future. The original letters have been received in Hong Kong. A translation of the essence of the letter is as follows: "To the students of Chinese universities: Since the beginning of your country's war of resistance, countless solemn and splendid academic institutions have been destroyed by the Japanese. However, professors and students, despite being displaced and experiencing hardship, have never succumbed to difficulties and forgotten their sacred mission. They continue to work hard and strive to regenerate and use steadfast courage to lay the foundation for your renaissance. Your students, in this belief, go forward courageously, proving the inherent spirit of hard work and learning since ancient times, and revealing the hope of the new world. This has aroused the admiration and moved the educators of the world. Our association was founded in 1920 in response to the needs after the First European War. At that time, we did our best to help European students. In the same spirit, we express our deep sympathy to your students. Since 7/7, we have continuously spread information about education in your country to the world, maintained close contact with student groups in various countries, and raised funds to help. It is estimated that there are now universities in thirty-seven countries that are vigorously shielding your country's struggle for national survival and donating money to express their sympathy. Today, the problem of China is equal to the problem of Europe. The second outbreak in Europe, rumours are rampant, but there are few that continue to pursue their studies. European students are not discouraged by this, but their organization is becoming stronger and their struggle is becoming more vigorous to maintain the foundation and purpose of their studies. Now, the misfortune of European universities is the same as in China. Although the eastern and western hemispheres are geographically different, what they encounter will eventually be solved. European students deeply feel that they will not stop helping your students because of their own difficulties."

### Education Briefs

The principal of National Third Middle School was originally held concurrently by Zhou Bangdao, a supervisor of the Ministry of Education. Now that Zhou has returned to his post as supervisor, the Ministry of Education has appointed Li Chaoying as the principal of National Third Middle School.

The president of Guangxi Provincial Medical College was formerly held concurrently by the chairman of the province. Now, Li Ting'an, a professor at the Medical College of Central University, has been hired to fill the post.

Because the number of high schools in Guizhou Province is small, the Ministry of Education has ordered the fourth service group of primary and secondary school teachers in the war zone to run four Zhongshan Middle School classes at the high school stage, which will be set up in Duyun, Anshun, Tongzi, and Xingren. Personnel have been dispatched to prepare for them.

The first meeting of the competition committee will be held tomorrow afternoon at 6:00 PM in the Rongsheng Society of the Paramount Hotel on Yu Yuan Road.

However, the registered teams still need to undergo a review by the competition committee tomorrow night to determine the selection. The original limit was for ten teams, but according to the current situation, it seems that it cannot be expanded. Therefore, the organizer intends to expand to twelve teams because it will be difficult to accommodate more due to time constraints.

### A Humble Opinion Regarding Whether Capital Verification for Limited Companies Should Be Subject to Government Registration

— Gong Maode

The Necessity of Capital Verification

A limited liability company (hereinafter referred to as "company") is a company formed by seven or more shareholders with limited liability. Shareholders bear no further liability; even if the company's assets are insufficient to pay off debts in the future, creditors have no right to claim payment of debts from the company's shareholders. Therefore, in a limited liability company, the total guarantee for the company's debts is only the company's total assets.

Considering that the initial form of a company's assets is the capital paid by shareholders, including cash and other assets that can be legally used to offset capital contributions, it is essential to verify whether the first installment of capital has been fully paid when the company is established or increases its capital. When assets other than cash are used to offset capital contributions, it is crucial to ensure the type, price, and number of shares allocated by the company are appropriate. This directly affects the company's actual assets and is related to the strength of the guarantee for the company's debts. Therefore, it is necessary to verify these matters before the company applies for establishment registration or capital increase registration. This verification work is commonly known as "capital verification."

Regarding capital verification, Article 91 of the Company Law stipulates: "After taking office, a director shall immediately request the competent authority to select an inspector to verify whether the first installment of capital has been fully paid and whether the following matters are accurate:

(1) For those using assets other than cash to offset capital contributions, the name of the contributor, the type and price of the assets, and the number of shares allocated by the company;

(2) The establishment expenses to be borne by the company and the amount of remuneration to be received by the promoters."

Article 103 stipulates: "The directors and supervisors shall investigate the following matters and report to the incorporation meeting:

(1) Whether the total number of shares has been fully subscribed;

(2) Whether the first installment of capital has been fully paid by each subscriber;

(3) Whether the matters listed in Article 89, Paragraph 3, and Article 91 are accurate.

If the directors and supervisors are selected from among the promoters, the incorporation meeting may elect other inspectors to conduct the aforementioned investigation and report."

Article 194 stipulates: "The supervisors shall investigate the following matters and report to the shareholders' meeting:

(1) Whether the newly issued shares have been fully subscribed;

(2) Whether the first installment of capital for each new share has been fully paid;

(3) If assets other than cash are used to offset capital contributions, whether the number of shares allocated is appropriate.

For the aforementioned investigation and report, the shareholders' meeting may elect inspectors."

Advantages of Capital Verification by Competent Authorities

Based on the content of Articles 91, 103, and 194 of the Company Law (listed in the previous section), we can see that companies established by promoters must have their capital verified by the competent authority. Companies established by solicitation have their capital verified by inspectors elected by the directors, supervisors, or shareholders' meeting. When a company increases its capital, the capital is verified by the supervisors or other elected inspectors. Although all these are types of capital verification, the entities responsible for verification are different. It is difficult to make an accurate judgment on the relative merits of various capital verification systems based solely on theory. However, based on past facts, the competent authority's position of strict supervision leads to the most credible verification results, which is undeniable.

The so-called "capital verification" is to check the sufficiency of a company's capital. Specifically, it refers to verifying whether the shares have been fully subscribed, whether the first installment of capital has been fully paid, and whether the number of shares allocated by the company when assets other than cash are used to offset capital contributions is appropriate. It is inappropriate for shareholders who have paid capital contributions, subscribed to shares, or allocated shares to conduct the verification themselves, to prevent bias and fraud. Therefore, to thoroughly implement the task of capital verification, it must be carried out by a third party other than the shareholders. However, if the third party is an inspector elected by the shareholders' meeting, the elected inspector is often closely related to some or all of the company's shareholders, or their interests are aligned with the entire company. This leads to a biased attitude in their inspection, favoring related shareholders or companies with aligned interests, which is only natural. Thus, the reliability of the inspection report is questionable. Who, then, is the most appropriate person to conduct the verification? The competent authority is the first choice. The competent authority is entrusted by the people of the country to handle matters within its jurisdiction, with the protection of the interests of all people as its highest ideal. Its relationship with companies, shareholders, and the general public is impartial, so its position is fair and its status is detached. Its verification report is, of course, the most reliable and without doubt.

Disadvantages of Capital Verification by Directors, Supervisors, or Inspectors

The disadvantages of capital verification by directors, supervisors, or inspectors were rarely discovered before the implementation of the profit-seeking enterprise income tax. However, since the introduction of the income tax, they have gradually become apparent. Because the profit-seeking enterprise income tax is levied based on the percentage of income to capital, and only one-third of the public reserve is allowed to be included in the capital calculation, some opportunistic entrepreneurs inevitably exploit the provision that companies established by solicitation do not need to apply to the competent authority for capital verification. They deliberately overstate the paid-up capital at the time of establishing the company, creating opportunities for tax evasion in the future.

As for already established companies, some, recognizing the lack of fairness in the current taxation standards, have implemented capital increases to achieve a more reasonable income tax burden. Most companies implementing capital increases follow stable and legal procedures. However, in reality, it is undeniable that some companies use the fact that capital increase registration does not require capital verification by the competent authority and employ various improper tricks to artificially inflate nominal capital (registered capital).

When these companies apply for establishment registration or capital increase registration, the Ministry of Economic Affairs may have already discerned the falsehood, but due to the limitations of its authority, it cannot obtain concrete evidence. If the registration requirements are met, it can only approve the application. However, if the number of such companies continues to increase, not only will the state's tax revenue suffer significant losses, but the interests of bona fide third parties (creditors and the general public) will also be permanently impaired. To protect the interests of the state and the people, the emergence of such companies must be prevented.

Remedial Measures

To prevent limited liability companies from falsely reporting capital, the most effective way is to stipulate that limited liability companies applying for establishment registration...

### Speculation on the Future of Rice Prices: Anniversary of the Rice Panic

— Bao Leti

The rice stored in the hands of hoarders has already been replaced with new rice before the mold season. Rice prices have started to rise sharply again. This is happening around the same time as last year, creating a sense of the anniversary of the rice panic. Furthermore, there are various excuses, making the surge even more dramatic. However, price trends are always related to supply and demand. The speculative profits of those who hoard and manipulate the market only benefit those who sell first. If you want to profit from hoarding, your financial luck this year will be very different from the past. Last year, hoarders profited because rice prices started to rise from a low base, so everything went smoothly. Now, the base is already too high, and this calculation will not work. No matter how essential rice is as a food, when the river rises to the level of the levees, it will overflow. It won't rise above the levees. After all, general purchasing power will restrain price trends. It's hard to be abstract, but the principle is unbreakable. Therefore, in this article, I will put aside the issues of morality and government control and only consider the rice merchants' desire for wealth. Can current rice prices hold?

Clearing Up the Reasons for the Rise

A prolonged drought indicates a disaster, and the rice shortage in eastern Zhejiang has affected Shanghai, so it seems that the rice price increase is inevitable. But this is not the case.

(1) There are still more than twenty days before the start of the mold season (July 15th in the Gregorian calendar). Who can guarantee that there will be a severe drought this year? The severity of the drought in 1934 was many times greater than today. There was no rain at all during the mold season, and the rainfall in June, July, and August was extremely low. The high temperatures at that time broke the high record of the past sixty years. Everyone thought there would be a severe drought. But that year, there was still a 60-70% harvest, and the most expensive rice price was only about 11 yuan per stone. Moreover, there has been rain in central Yangtze River area, and the current pressure change is a precursor to the coming of rain.

(2) Eastern Zhejiang has a thin rice yield, so famine occurs every year, and it has always been supplemented by transportation from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui. This year will be no exception. Everyone in the industry knows this. Using the rice shortage in eastern Zhejiang as an excuse for hoarding can only deceive outsiders. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's telegram ordering disaster relief and Yu Qiaqing's telegram discussing the matter both come from the common sentiment of concern for one's hometown. Now, they are actually being used by rice bugs as reasons to raise prices, which is really heartbreaking! (I think this type of document should not be made public, to avoid being exploited.)

(3) The coastal defense was once blocked, and Hong Kong also banned rice exports, so the source of foreign rice seems to be a problem. However, transportation to Burma and Siam is unimpeded. The economy of Annam relies entirely on rice exports. The blockade is at most temporary and not a long-term solution, especially since it has now been lifted. When the Bean and Rice Industry Association wrote to the concession authorities yesterday, it said that if the Hong Kong ban "is not urgently addressed, I am afraid that the price surge will be difficult to stop." In fact, Hong Kong is not a rice-producing area. Although Nanyang ships all pass through Hong Kong, the Hong Kong ban does not hinder the transport of foreign rice to Shanghai. Although Shanghai has a lot of foreign rice handled by Hong Kong merchants, the transport goes directly from the production area to Shanghai and does not go through Hong Kong warehouses first. Even if it exists, the number must be very small. However, it is always good for Hong Kong to lift the ban and restore free trade. But the ban or lack thereof has nothing to do with rice prices. The association's statement is difficult to justify. Now that the coastal defense blockade has been lifted and rice merchants have lost their basis for raising prices, the association's remarks seem to be handing people ammunition, which is a pity.

(4) Japan is experiencing a rice shortage and is coming to China to search for rice to supplement its supplies. However, it is an exaggeration to say that this will cause a shortage of domestic rice. According to the recent survey report released by the Japan Rice Countermeasures Council, the total amount of rice supplied in Japan this year is 78 million stone, and the total amount needed is 83 million stone, so the supply is short by 10 million stone. However, according to Japanese Agriculture Minister Shimada's report to the House of Representatives, the amount of rice supplied this year, including existing rice and already scheduled imports of Siamese rice, totals 100 million stone. In this case, there is a surplus. Regardless of which is true, if they really come to China to purchase, the degree will not be as great as most people imagine.

(5) The Japanese army in China is eating local rice, which is indeed another root cause of the increase in domestic rice consumption. However, the casualties of the population during wartime may offset this. The rural population in China has always been excessive. Even today, there is still plenty of rural labor, so there is no problem in production. Moreover, the current surge in rice prices has implicitly encouraged farmers to increase rice fields and increase rice production. It can be anticipated that the supply of rice this year will be much greater than normal.

(6) In war zones, farmers stop farming, which is indeed a major threat to production. However, Chinese farmers are calm and courageous, unmatched in the world. When soldiers arrive, they flee; when soldiers leave, they continue farming. During the Shanghai war, farming in the suburbs of Shanghai continued as usual, which is clear evidence of this. Furthermore, according to the National Government Agricultural Foundation's survey report, in 1938, rice production still accounted for 81% of the 1937 level. At that time, the war was taking place in rice-producing areas, and the harvest was still so good. Moreover, the war has now moved to mountainous areas, which does not hinder farming.

(7) Although Shanghai is not a rice-producing area, it is the distribution center for the rice-producing areas of the country. Although the wartime situation has changed slightly, there is still a background of rice fields in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui with an annual output of about 30 million stone. The total population of the three provinces is at most 70 million, and the amount needed is at most 200 million, so the supply is obviously more than enough. The Shanghai rice market is responsible for supplying the entire country. Now, it only supplies Shanghai and the surrounding area. In any case, the supply will not be insufficient.

(8) Japan monopolizes the transportation and sale of rice in the producing areas, so the supply of domestic rice to Shanghai seems to be a problem. But Japan's main purpose in monopolizing is to make a profit, which is one of their means of "using war to support war." If the transport of rice to Shanghai is cut off, the economy of farmers in the interior will inevitably go bankrupt. The bankruptcy of Chinese farmers would be pleasing to Japan, but they would lose their means of plunder. Under their purpose of "using war to support war," this is impossible. Currently, most of the ports along the Yangtze River and the coast have fallen, except for Shanghai and Ningbo. Is it that the Japanese army is especially kind to the people of Shanghai and Ningbo? No, they are only leaving this to facilitate their plunder. Knowing this, it can be said with certainty that Japan will not cut off the transport of rice from the interior to Shanghai.

The Situation of the Rice Industry

General price trends are always controlled by the supply and demand of the goods themselves and the strength of social purchasing power. As mentioned above, there is no basis for rice prices to continue to rise. Why is there such a sharp rise now? In a word: the rice bugs are celebrating their anniversary, creating a new high standard to alleviate the current difficulties in their business. If prices do not rise, it will be difficult for the Japanese puppet regime to develop new ways to plunder. This is the cause of today's situation. The people's food is sacrificed, but they will also reap what they sow. Let me be presumptuous again and briefly describe the cause and effect.

In early May of last year, rice prices were still under the price limit of 14 yuan. At that time, the Japanese puppet regime's indirect exploitation was limited to the difference between the price in the producing area and the price in Shanghai. Otherwise, traders would hesitate, and the Japanese puppet regime would have no way to plunder. At this time, the price in the producing area, the price in Shanghai, and the Japanese puppet regime's amount of plunder were all maintained in equilibrium. There was peace for about two years.

The prices of everything in Shanghai have risen, but the rice industry alone is subject to price limits. This is very unfair!" So the rice firms first raised the wholesale price to 14 　, while allowing rice shops to sell at a retail price of a few cents above the 14 yuan limit. The price limit was like a hymen. Once broken, there was no restraint, and rice prices began to soar. The Japanese puppet regime's amount of indirect plunder also increased, and the price of rice in the producing area also rose rapidly. In this cycle of rising prices, Shanghai rice merchants, rice merchants in the producing areas, rice traders, and the Japanese puppet regime's indirect plunderers all made a fortune. But Shanghai rice prices soared past the price of foreign rice, so Shanghai rice merchants could no longer raise prices, because domestic rice was too expensive, which made foreign rice sell well. This is the reason why Shanghai rice prices have been stable recently, and it is also the beginning of the Shanghai rice industry's desire for wealth being restrained. Because his raw materials were already high, there was no way to get a huge profit without raising prices.

Although Shanghai rice prices are limited by foreign rice prices, the price of rice in the producing areas is still rising. The closer the price in the producing area is to the price in Shanghai, the less the profit that the Japanese puppet regime can extort. So, under the guise of "stabilizing food in the occupied areas," the Japanese puppet regime began to control rice prices in the occupied areas. The price of rice in the producing areas cannot continue to rise freely. For example, in Suzhou, it was once suppressed at a price limit of 20 yuan per stone. At that time, the price in Shanghai was above 40 yuan, so the Japanese puppet regime's extortion could reach a huge profit of 15 to 20 yuan. This is the beginning of the price of rice in the producing areas being restrained by violence.

Shanghai rice prices are suppressed by foreign rice prices, and foreign rice prices are suppressed by black market exchange rates, while the price of rice in the producing areas is suppressed by the gun. But the Japanese puppet regime can still adjust its extortion rate according to the rise and fall of foreign rice prices. The profits of Shanghai rice bugs, rice bugs in the producing areas, and rice traders are wiped out by the Japanese puppet regime. This is the retribution for their help. Although it is self-inflicted, their current business is indeed difficult. At this point, they should wake up and launch a joint counterattack against the indirect plunderers to survive. But they insist on repeating the same mistake and continue to attack consumers.

When the 52 black market exchange rate turmoil occurred, the rice bugs were complacent. Foreign rice prices rose sharply, and domestic rice followed. However, the exchange market turmoil quickly subsided, and black market exchange rates gradually rose again. The rice market price surge was suppressed. Not wanting to be reconciled, the rice shortage in eastern Zhejiang suddenly sounded an alarm. A good opportunity was hard to come by, so they expanded their use of it. They also used threats such as drought and the coastal defense blockade, so the era of foreign rice leading domestic rice changed to a new era of domestic rice leading foreign rice. Now, they are still spreading rumors, claiming how much rice prices will rise in the future. They have the ambition to follow Germany's psychological warfare strategy and implement their preemptive strategy. But there is no basis for this. So, the higher the rice price is pushed up, the greater the danger in the future. As long as there is heavy rain and people are comforted, a price drop is inevitable. So, the sooner you sell, the safer you are. If you tighten the grip and don't let go, you will inevitably become more rigid and be scolded by others! What could be more unwise?

### Finance: Weekly Review of Foreign Exchange

According to the Shanghai Economic Consulting Institute's report, since the dramatic changes in the exchange market on May 2, the lowest prices were US$4.5 and £3.125. Afterwards, they gradually increased. On Saturday, the closing prices were US$6.03125 and £3.90625. According to market rumors, the factors causing the fluctuations are as follows:

(1) Local Panic, (2) French Armistice, (3) Silver Agreement, (4) Southern Advance Policy, (5) Invitation of Mr. Stimson to the Cabinet, (6) Rumors of Mr. Song Flying to the US and Issuance of Treasury Bills, (7) Exchange Stabilization Fund Buying.

The reasons for local panic are the intensification of the Southern Advance Policy and the military failures of the Allied Powers. If the Southern Advance Policy is implemented, international trade will become more difficult, but the actual need for foreign exchange will decrease with the reduction of imports. The market price may turn flat. Regarding Shanghai's position, people's views differ. Some view economics as more important than politics, while others view politics as more important than economics. The former raises calves to fatten themselves and will not resort to violence. The latter preserves what is left and should strive to maintain it. The so-called panic is merely a psychological effect. Although France has made peace, the possibility of Britain continuing to fight is still high. The US, due to its increased aid, may become more easily embroiled in the war. Even if Germany and Italy continue to dominate, when they acquire substantial colonies, their resources will increase, and production will be abundant. The Far East will still be a very good market for them to dump goods. At that time, the possibility of maintaining the balance of power in East Asia will be greater, which will benefit China's monetary system. The Tianjin silver problem has been rumored for a long time. Although it has been resolved now, it does not seem to have given the market much of a stimulus. Moreover, the Tianjin blockade has been lifted, and the future of the concessions seems to be able to maintain the status quo, so the exchange market may not change drastically. Mr. Stimson's appointment as Secretary of War symbolizes that the US will actively aid countries that have been invaded. This is because Mr. Stimson's remarks have always advocated justice. Now that he has been brought into the cabinet, it is believed that the isolationist faction has lost its power. The US is preparing to organize a coalition government in preparation for intervention in the war. Although it is difficult to predict where it will lead, at a time when the Southern Advance Policy is rampant, it is necessary to strike back at those who are striking. Therefore, the future of the fiat currency can be viewed optimistically. Mr. Song is a powerful proponent of sound fiscal policies. Now he has decided to fly to the US. Although his mission is unclear, it is expected that this trip will be fruitful. As for the issuance of treasury bills, it is related to monetary reform, which may not be permitted by the current environment.

Furthermore, it is the responsibility of the Exchange Stabilization Fund to buy and sell according to the rise and fall of exchange rates. However, the general public softens because of its buying, which is probably due to a misunderstanding of the nature of the Exchange Stabilization Fund's buying compared to retail investors and speculators. When the Exchange Stabilization Fund buys to a certain extent, it will maintain a certain level. The more it buys, the more abundant its funds will be, and the stronger its ability to maintain a certain level will be. However, at a time when the international situation is changing rapidly, it is more beneficial for the Exchange Stabilization Fund to maintain a natural level.

Only a few scattered shipments have arrived, with current market prices reaching 190 yuan, an unprecedented high.

### Changes in Commodity Prices: A Statistical Analysis

### A Short Preface to Climbing Danya Mountain

Danya Mountain in Taizhou is located between Tiantai and Yandang Mountains. According to legend, Ge Hong, also known as Ge Zhichuan, from the Jin Dynasty, refined elixirs here. The traces of his immortality, such as the bald-tailed snails, scaleless crucian carp, red shrimp, and purple crabs, were all foods he cooked and discarded on the ground, and they still thrive in the ponds today. Also, the Immortal Bed Stone Chamber is where he set up his furnace and practiced alchemy. The tall trees on the mountain pierce the sky, and the blood vines coil around the streams. The golden starry stones shine all over the ground, all being rare objects. Starting from the first month of Dingchou year, the mountain people began constructing pavilions and towers, repairing ridges, ponds, embankments, and bridges, and planting flowers and trees extensively. By the Double Ninth Festival of last year, the project was completed. Hundreds of famous scholars were invited to climb the mountain, compose poems, play music with lanterns, and hold a grand banquet. The cassia trees were in full bloom that day, and the golden cassia blossoms in the lunar palace seemed to be waiting to add to the mountain people's enjoyment. The dignitaries present appreciated and praised the extraordinary event! The poems composed at the time caused a sensation far and wide. Letters arrived daily without fail. The misty Baopu Two-Story Building on the mountain, with its poetry notes pasted on the walls, shone brightly, truly worthy of being passed down. The small preface to the Cornelian Cherry gathering is also recorded, as well as the matching verses of seven-character poems by the sisters Qu Xiangzao and Mei Hui and the scholar Qi Hequan and his son Shaojun Xiaohuan. The Qu sisters also sent a letter to their teacher Qi, which stated: "When Xiang was by the side of the teacher's seat in Hangzhou in the autumn, the teacher jokingly said, 'How about taking you sisters to the literary circle to compete?' Xiang replied, 'Wanting to secure a seat on a famous mountain, a small sail can hardly withstand the wind at Madang. Alas, alas!'"

### A Word on the Price of Rice

— Daoke

Suggestions for Relief Measures

Food is the paramount concern of the people, and "rice" is the source of sustenance for the masses. The ancients said, "When the granaries are full, people know etiquette; when clothing and food are sufficient, people know honor and shame." In other words, when elephants have "rice" to store, they can observe "etiquette" and "ritual." When everyone is warmly clothed and "well-fed," they can respect "honor" and know "shame." To put it more plainly, if there is no rice at home, one may resort to desperate measures. Without clothing and food, one will be ignorant of the distinction between honor and shame and will disregard everything, forced into committing crimes. When everyone suffers from not having "food" and the fire of hunger erupts, how can they observe order? How can we even talk about security?

Fellow countrymen of the impoverished masses, encountering calamity, have already suffered the pain of being displaced by gunfire and are now facing the suffering of rice hoarding. The price of rice is rising without limit. Foreign rice is sold for 67 yuan and 5 jiao per shi, while domestic rice is priced at 74 yuan and 5 jiao per shi. Under the rice merchants' profiteering during the crisis, the mouths of the poor are being choked again! I ask you, what way out is there for the poor? What life is left for them? I cannot help but lament, "Its demise is imminent, hanging by a mulberry sprout!" Looking ahead, will the tragedy of exchanging children to eat their flesh and humans eating humans (the poor fighting the rich) truly be staged?

I ponder this, I seriously ponder this, the seriousness of the situation is unprecedented! Originally, the current world is a world where one person eats another, the strong bully the weak, the many tyrannize the few, the large devour the small, and the small devour the large (referring to small countries invading large countries). Where is civilization? Where is order? What we see is a bloody world and a tragic ending! It will not stop until the entire human race is destroyed! Recalling that since this isolated island became separated from the National Army and left the embrace of the motherland, the price of rice has risen from 14 yuan per shi to 20 yuan, then to 30 yuan, then to 40 yuan, and so on... up to today's 70-80 yuan per shi. Who is responsible for this?

I pace around the room, my heart filled with worry and anger. I almost want to skin the profiteering merchants and eat their flesh! Alas! The "expensive" in "rice is expensive" is actually snobbish, composed of "insect" and "shell," symbolizing that the rice weevil only knows the wealth of "shells," ruthlessly exploiting and disregarding the plight of the poor. Did Cangjie, the ancient inventor of writing, foresee this and create this "character" as a warning? Saving people from hunger is like putting out a fire. I hope that Shanghai's group leaders, philanthropists, and the authorities of the concessions, who are responsible for security, will quickly implement controlled rice distribution and ration grain according to the number of people (first conduct a quick census). Based on the cost of rice in storage, they should quickly organize sales at fair prices to relieve the urgent needs of the starving people! In the Spring and Autumn period, Xinshi Jiran served the King of Yue and advised him to observe popular tastes, value circulation, promote equality, and prohibit stagnation. The king adopted his strategy and achieved great governance. Therefore, I hope that the authorities of the concessions will emulate Jiran's actions, find ways to dredge the transportation of foreign and domestic rice, and properly plan measures to use the wealth to help the poor (the wealthy families have too much rice stored). They should prohibit (censure) merchants from hoarding rice and profiting from scarcity. They must achieve the goals of observing popular tastes, valuing circulation, promoting equality, and prohibiting stagnation, so that the poor can be saved. This will not only be the fortune of the people but also the fortune of the future of security.

### From Socks to Wooden Clogs

— Yiming

Since everything has increased in price, clothing, food, housing, and transportation have all become difficult. Just talking about clothing, adding new clothes is harder than climbing to the blue sky. A set of long gowns costs no less than 20-30 gold, this difficulty goes without saying. Even buying a pair of socks requires careful calculation. My socks, costing more than one yuan a pair, are not necessarily good. They wear out quickly, becoming useless.

As the weather gets hotter, socks in clothing can be omitted, and it is acceptable to go barefoot. You don't have to worry about being criticized as "lumpenproletariat" or being labeled as modern. In short, I save mine. But socks can be omitted, shoes must be worn, so at least buy a pair of cloth shoes, which will cost five yuan or more. Leather shoes are even more expensive, one pair can be the equivalent of a peasant family's expenses for half a year in the past. It's not just "the rich man's feast, the poor man's half-year's food," but "an ordinary pair of shoes, the poor man's half-year's food," but now even food is expensive.

I have always advocated not taking cars, so no matter how much trams and buses increase in price, it has nothing to do with me, only my legs suffer. However, thinking that people should work, and also can take advantage of an exercise opportunity, I am very content. But unfortunately, shoes, after this excessive exercise, after not long service, in due course, rudely showed holes and announced the end of service, informing you need to find a successor to hand over the procedures. Unable to do otherwise, running shoes and sneakers are the only grace, but moisture is a defect.

Now the weather is hot, timely slippers are a must, because I want to be more economical, I found the old slippers last year's leather, and wanted to match with a sole, but it costs two yuan and a half, so I had to delay.

On Sunday, I suddenly found in the corner of the box a pair of wooden slippers that were previously handmade, which I always despised. At this time, I remembered its current usefulness, like discovering a treasure, and put it on. Indeed, it's great, comfortable and convenient, whether bathing or after bathing, or enjoying the cool, whenever I get home, I change into them and alternate them with my shoes. In this way, indirectly saving money, directly saving material, isn't it doubly beautiful? If you agree, readers, why not make a pair for yourself in these difficult times?

### The Light in the Bedroom

— Fan Xuehui

In recent times, as various sciences have gradually developed, many people have been researching and correcting the light configuration in bedrooms.

Modern architecture believes that the windows of a bedroom should be one-quarter the size of the bedroom's area to be suitable for sanitary facilities.

The light in the bedroom should not be too strong or too dim. If the light is too strong, it will easily tire the eyes. If the light is too weak, it will further damage the eyes when trying to see things. Both of these can hinder a person's health. Therefore, generally speaking, the light in the bedroom must have an appropriate balance.

The light should not be dazzling, but gentle. Nowadays, the walls of new-style bedrooms should be painted with non-glossy paint, which is most suitable.

Even the furniture in new-style homes should be painted with non-glossy light gray paint. Non-glossy light gray furniture has the effect of absorbing light and will not, like furniture of other colors, strongly reflect light, causing people to feel uneasy.

### A Walking Guide to Shanghai

— Cikai

The scope of walking is the road, the tool is the vehicle, the purpose is the house, and the identifier of the house is the direction and street number.

Except for a few inversions and indentations (such as the area around Avenue Joffre and Rue Ratard), the increase in street numbers has a definite direction. Horizontal roads run from east to west, and for straight roads, the French Concession runs from north to south, while the International Settlement runs from south to north. If people walk in the direction of increasing numbers, the left side of the road (or river) has odd numbers, and the right side has even numbers. The segment intersected by the road perpendicular to it often has its own starting and ending numbers. Each segment has an average of 40 to 50 numbers, up to more than 100, but there are often missing numbers.

Based on the above principle, I can determine a good way to find direction. Below are eight sentences:

French Concession: International Settlement:

Follow left add, south. Follow left add, west.

Follow right add, west. Follow right add, north.

Opposite left add, east. Opposite left add, south.

Opposite right add, north. Opposite right add, east.

If we do not know which direction we are facing when walking, first see if we are following the direction of increasing numbers? If so, it is called "following," if not, it is called "opposite." Second, see which side the numbers of the intersecting road are increasing from, to determine whether it is "left add" or "right add." Then, recite the sentence to know which direction you are walking.

The direction of roads in the eastern part of the International Settlement can be seen from the road name, with provincial names for straight roads and city names for horizontal roads.

As for distinguishing which concession you are in, you can look at the utility poles on the side of the road. The utility poles in the International Settlement are square-edged wooden poles painted red, while those in the French Concession are triangular white cement poles. Although the French Concession also has square-edged wooden poles painted red, the International Settlement does not have cement poles. To know if you have left the concession, you can look at the street sign, the street sign of the concession is blue with white letters to distinguish.

If the station does not have a platform or a large sign, you can find a utility pole. There is a section of red paint on the utility pole at the formal station, and a section of green paint at the stop station, both of which can be seen from a distance.

In the French Concession, the fares for first-class and third-class buses are the same. This is not the case in the International Settlement. The fare difference between first-class and third-class is listed in the comparison table below for easy identification.

People in Shanghai often use back doors to enter and exit. Since the back door has no street number, the number often written in chalk is often used to find the street number.

I have not been in Shanghai for a long time. In my spare time, I take a walk on the road, always observing the objects on the roadside and the various ways of walking. Since I don't know much and have no one familiar to ask, nor any books to consult, I have written this article to be used as a reference for newcomers. There are many errors and omissions, and I hope "old Shanghai" people will correct them.

Statement: The article "Talking about Rice" signed by Lv last week, was reported by reader Gu Deyi, who attached a paragraph of the original text as proof and claimed that it was plagiarized from another newspaper. In addition to announcing the cancellation of the manuscript fee, I would like to thank Gu Jun.

### (33) Almond Tofu, Sweet or Salty (Four Summer Dishes)

Preparation... One bowl of sweet almonds, five bitter almonds, half a cup of bean flour, half a cup of glutinous rice flour, half a cup of lotus root flour, crystalline monosodium glutamate, white sugar, rose syrup, or mushrooms, fragrant mushrooms, soy sauce, sesame oil

Preparation... Soak the sweet almonds and bitter almonds in water until plump, remove their skins, and grind them into a slurry with water. Pour the slurry into a cloth bag and squeeze out the juice. Then, steam the juice in a pot, mix it with bean flour, glutinous rice flour, lotus root flour, and an appropriate amount of crystalline monosodium glutamate, etc. Stir with a spatula until it boils, then remove from the heat and let it cool, which will cause it to solidify into almond tofu. Then, cut it into squares. If you prefer sweet food, add an appropriate amount of white sugar and rose syrup. If you prefer salty food, cut it into squares and boil them in mushroom and fragrant mushroom soup first, then add mushrooms, fragrant mushrooms, and an appropriate amount of soy sauce, etc. Cover and simmer until cooked through. Then, serve and sprinkle with a little sesame oil. Its taste is fresh and tender and has the effect of relieving the heart and reducing the lungs.

Note: The taste is weak if this product is made purely from sweet almonds, not as long as the taste of bitter almonds, but too much bitter almond is also toxic, so it is appropriate to use less. Please send to No. 586 Haining Road, this recipe editor, once recorded, will pay a small fee.

If you would like to purchase "monosodium glutamate" and oil, salt, soy sauce, and vinegar, please call "44194" and a special delivery will be arranged immediately without taking delivery fees.

### One Week Economic Menu

— Ms. Huaying

Among all the auxiliary ingredients in dishes, the cheapest and most suitable one is snow cabbage. Snow cabbage is also known as snow-in-the-red, produced around Taihu Lake. In winter, it is salted in jars and tightly covered. It can be taken out and eaten in the second year of spring. It has a very fresh taste, so it is good to put it in any meat or vegetable dish. In this year, nothing is cheap, fish, meat, shrimp, are all surprisingly expensive, not to mention chicken and duck. For example, in a family with many people, buying four or five corners of pork is not enough for a chopstick pick, so the housewife has to think of an economical way to cut the meat into shreds and put five cents or one corner of snow cabbage in it, (it is even better if you have it yourself, you can use it at any time.) It can be used for two bowls day and night, and everyone eats more. In addition, there are too many things that can "cooperate" with snow cabbage. Don't underestimate it, snow cabbage shrimp kernels and snow cabbage small yellow croaker can sometimes be served on the dinner table. Even in vegetarian dishes, such as snow cabbage braised tofu, snow cabbage stir-fried tea bean sprouts or soybean sprouts, it also feels very fresh. In short, snow cabbage is really like licorice in medicinal materials. It is often needed.

### Record of the Examination for Trainees and Learners at the China Book Company

— San Hou

At the beginning of this month, there was an advertisement in various newspapers that was as attractive as a magnet. It was a notice from the Shanghai Office of the China Book Company announcing the recruitment of trainees and learners. What a joyful piece of news this was!

The qualifications for this application were specified as follows: (1) Graduates of junior high school with diplomas. (2) Current junior high school students graduating this summer. (3) High school dropouts who have worked in other commercial institutions; and must be proficient in writing and calculation, with some understanding of bookkeeping. The procedure was simple. You just needed to write a letter of recommendation and send it to the Shanghai Office of the China Book Company on Hartung Road, along with a half-length photograph.

The China Book Company has always recruited staff and trainees privately. Like last year, it was not even advertised in the newspapers, and only internal staff knew about it, so there were not many applicants. This time, with the public examination, the number of applicants was nearly 1,300. This shows how many young people are unemployed and how eager they are to find work!

After a strict selection process, approximately 240 people were approved to take the exam. The exam period was last Sunday morning, and the location was the Binhai Middle School on Nanyang Road.

Because there were so many people taking the exam, it was held in two sessions. The first session started at 8:00 AM, and the second session started at 10:30 AM. The chief examiner was Mr. Wu Yugan, the director of the company's accounting department, and the proctors were Sun Zongfu, Xu Danian, and more than ten others.

The subjects of the examination were divided into four categories: Chinese, English, General Knowledge, Arithmetic, and Bookkeeping. The Chinese test was very simple: write an essay on the topic "Seeking Education and Seeking Employment."

The English test was divided into two categories: (1) Noun translation from Chinese to English, with a total of six words: letter paper, envelope, fountain pen, discount, invoice, receipt, mostly related to commerce. (2) Translation of words and sentences from English to Chinese, including eleven questions: related to commerce, such as Dra-ft, bill, Here is a bot-tle of high quality, etc.; and related to general knowledge, such as Season ticket, eleva-tor, telephone, etc.

The General Knowledge test consisted of nine questions, covering a wide range of content. For example: (1) How many routes are there to Chongqing now? Please list the important places they pass through. (2) What books and magazines do you like to read? List them and explain their advantages respectively. (3) What are the postage fees for sending ordinary letters, registered letters, express letters, and airmail letters? (Referring to sending to other provinces.) (4) What is the difference between "investment" and "speculation"?

The Arithmetic and Bookkeeping test consisted of two arithmetic questions and four bookkeeping questions. The second arithmetic question was quite complicated. Now I will transcribe it as follows: There are thirteen male workers, eight female workers, and seven child workers who jointly contracted a job that took thirty-four days to complete. The total wages received were nine hundred and eighty-six yuan. It was agreed to distribute the wages according to ability. The ability of a male worker is twice that of a female worker, and three times that of a child worker. Question: What is the daily wage of each person? The four bookkeeping questions were: (1) What are the differences between single-entry bookkeeping and double-entry bookkeeping? (2) What are the differences between cost accounting and general accounting? (3) What are the elements of bookkeeping? (4) What is the accounting term for the net amount of assets exceeding liabilities?

It is said that the quota for this recruitment is 60 people, and those who pass the exam will be assigned to the company's accounting department, editorial department, distribution department, and other departments. During the service period, in addition to regular salary, there are basic subsidies, living allowances, and so on. After the apprenticeship period is over, they can be promoted to formal staff members.

The results will be announced after one month because after the list of those admitted is finalized, it must be submitted to the Hong Kong headquarters for verification, as usual.

### Strengthening Unity Among Employees

— Shi Wei

No one can deny that the Chinese nation has united. But no one can admit that this unity is very solid. Let others talk about the big picture; let's look at the situation among employees.

First of all, we should recognize that in the process of China completing its great cause, the efforts of employees play a decisive role; therefore, strengthening unity among employees has become a very important issue.

Only by diagnosing the problem can we prescribe the right medicine. What are the shortcomings of unity among employees?

Undeniably, China, under the control of a semi-feudal and semi-colonial economic structure, has demonstrated complete feudalism in its various industrial and business sectors. Most employed workers have no one to rely on, so there will be "a new emperor brings in a new courtier" situation, and restrictions will be imposed on employee unity... This is an objective reason why employees cannot unite well.

The subjective aspects are: First, staff look down on workers and trainees. Among the same class, those who came first look down on those who came later. Second, Ningbo people feel that Cantonese people are too stiff, Cantonese people think Ningbo people are too stingy, and Jiangbei people are looked down upon by everyone. This is a kind of localism. Third, relying on "connections," individuals climb upward, harming others to benefit themselves. Fourth, the bad habit of sweeping only the snow in front of one's own door. Fifth, the relationship between men and women is mostly "no touching," and so on.

Obviously, these wrong ideas cannot exist. First, the determination of the workers and the ideological progress of the trainees are of great help to the staff. Why should we look down on them?

Second, in today's united nation, why do we still insist on this kind of localism? Third, relying on "connections" and climbing upward is not going to work. We should pay attention to collective power. Fourth, taking care of yourself alone cannot be managed and will slowly send yourself to the grave. Fifth, in the present situation where men and women work side by side, "men and women should not touch each other" should no longer exist.

As for reforming the defects of the industrial sector itself, this cannot be separated from the cause we are currently undertaking.

I hope everyone pays attention to this issue.

He exclaimed in surprise: "Oh, there is so much money here! Li Lan is really confused, how could she just put the money in the drawer like that?"

Hawthorne Detective Cases

### The Ballerina's Ending

— Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter Two "A Page of History!"

Hawthorne did not answer, but showed Li Zhiban the photos. Li Zhiban took a look and took out two half-length photos in Western suits.

He pointed to one and said, "This is the one surnamed Yu." Then he pointed to a small two-inch photo, "This is the one who has been coming in and out here often these days, the taller one."

I leaned closer to look; the one surnamed Yu was only about twenty years old, with a very handsome face, and the smaller one was older, with a square jaw and particularly bright eyes.

Hawthorne nodded and put these two photos in his chest pocket, put the rest back in the drawer, and closed the drawer.

Hawthorne said to Li Zhiban, "Mr. Li, you can go back upstairs and rest now. Regarding what happened last night, I want to ask the servants here first. If there is anything I can ask of you, I will come and ask for your advice. I don't think you will mind."

Li Zhiban hurriedly replied, "What are you saying? Li Lan died so tragically. As long as I can help her get justice, I am willing to do whatever I can."

Hawthorne bowed. "Thank you." Then he watched the old man with a hunched back and coughing walk out.

Ni Jinshou stood up and asked, "Should I call old Mao in? He is in the guard room outside."

Hawthorne said, "No, call the maid first."

Ni Jinshou responded and just as he walked out of the door of the reception room, Li Zhiban suddenly retreated back in.

He said, "Mr. Hawthorne, I'm sorry, I was really careless, I forgot my cigarette holder again." He walked to the desk, picked up the imitation ivory cigarette holder from the edge of the desk, bowed again, and walked out.

I said to Hawthorne, "I just guessed that this cigarette holder didn't seem like it was left by the murderer. Because the murderer came in to assassinate, he would definitely not be so calm and unhurried as to hold a cigarette in his mouth."

Hawthorne just nodded, seemingly agreeing with my view. (24)

### Summer Vacation Volunteer School

— Lian

I recently received news from a classmate that a summer vacation volunteer elementary school for neighborhood children will be opening inside the Youth Association Middle School at 599 Sichuan Road. Most of the teachers are students from the Youth Association Middle School, using their summer vacation to help children who are out of school. The school is divided into four levels of primary school and two levels of higher primary school. The primary school curriculum focuses on Chinese language, general knowledge, and arithmetic; the higher primary school also includes English. Regarding tuition fees, they do not charge any fees. They only take a security deposit of 2 jiao when registering, which will be returned after the end of the semester (limited to those with less than three absences). The school also provides all books and supplies free of charge. After the end of the semester, students with excellent grades can not only receive a bonus, but can also be recommended by the school to appropriate middle and primary schools.

The school is scheduled to officially start classes on June 29th (until August 31st), and registration is from now until June 28th. The location is inside the Youth Association Middle School on Sichuan Road. Any male or female student under the age of sixteen can register.

In the midst of rising book and stationery prices and increasing tuition fees at various schools, the establishment of this school is really good news for out-of-school children.
