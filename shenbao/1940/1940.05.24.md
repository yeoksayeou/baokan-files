### Northern Hubei Chinese Army Counterattacks Again: 50,000 Japanese Soldiers Encircled; Large Numbers of Chinese Troops Arrive at the Front from Laohekou; Most of the Remaining Japanese Forces at Huyang and Huhe Eliminated

Chongqing: A Chinese military spokesman told reporters this afternoon that Japan, confused by the precedents in Europe, is actually attempting an Asian-style blitzkrieg strategy in Central China. Japanese forces, blinded by their desire for victory, have ignored the fact that the situation in Europe and China have several drastically different elements. The vastness of the Central China front, the difficulty of transportation, the rugged terrain, and the harsh climate, all contribute to the failure of Japan's efforts. The spokesman did not shy away from the intensity of the Japanese offensive in recent days, admitting that Yanyang was recaptured by the Chinese army on May 16th, only to be seized by the Japanese army three days later. It is said that yesterday morning, the Japanese vanguard had already reached the vicinity of Fancheng and Xiangyang, which are the main objectives of the Japanese offensive. Xiangyang has been under heavy Japanese artillery bombardment, but the Chinese army began a counteroffensive again yesterday afternoon, and a large number of reinforcements advanced from Laohekou, repelling the Japanese forces and relieving the danger to the Tang and Bai Rivers and Xiangfan. The current Japanese line stretches from Taipingcheng on the right to Longshan Temple on the left. The Chinese army has once again encircled the Japanese forces in the Zhaoyang area, estimating that no less than 50,000 people are trapped within the Chinese army's encirclement. Among them, 30,000 were dispatched during the first offensive, and 20,000 were reinforcements brought in last week. The Japanese side used more mechanized units this time than in any previous battle, with at least two mechanized regiments participating, each requiring more than 3,000 trucks to support their numerous tanks. In addition, there were also many heavy artillery pieces and aircraft. In this battle, the Chinese army has captured or destroyed more than 4,000 trucks. This seems to be a serious tactical error on the part of the Japanese army. Japan's strategy is good, but the tactics it employs are very poor. The current situation has put the Japanese army in a very dangerous situation. The majority of Japan's armed forces are trying to rescue troops that cannot retreat. The spokesman concluded by saying that the Chinese army is confident that it can completely annihilate the Japanese army in Zhaoyang within a few days. (Reuters dispatch on the 23rd)

### Women's Comfort Association Comforts the Air Force

Chongqing: Madame Chiang Song Meiling, Director of the National Women's Comfort Association, noted that Japanese planes have recently repeatedly attempted to raid the capital, and it is thanks to the heroic Chinese air force soldiers who bravely defend the airspace and deliver a head-on blow to the Japanese.

Editorial

### Germany and Italy in the Mediterranean and the Far East

According to reports, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini is scheduled to deliver a speech in Naples today, stating Italy's attitude towards the European war situation. Since Germany's invasion of Poland, Italy has adhered to two points from the beginning: first, hoping for reconciliation between the warring countries, and second, Italy will not participate in the war for the time being. The meaning of these two points is extremely subtle and dynamic. Italy has been maintaining this position since September. However, as the scope of the war has extended to Norway, not only has the tone of anti-British and pro-German sentiment in Italy become increasingly fierce, but also various war preparations and social movements have shown the increasingly sharp antagonism between Britain and Italy. The opportunity to participate in the war is therefore seen as being in imminent danger of collapse. Therefore, today's statement that the Italian Prime Minister is about to state Italy's attitude towards the European war is, in fact, no attitude at all, and is almost equivalent to saying that war will be declared today. What day is today? May 24, 1915, Italy signed a secret agreement with Britain and France, and then successively fought against Austria and Germany. Today is the 25th anniversary of that day.

According to another report, Germany intends to take a clever but risky action in the Far East, that is, to borrow Hainan Island from Japan, which it occupies in China, as a base for submarines to fight against Britain and France in the Far East. Qiongya is China's only large island, with harbors like dog teeth, located between British Hong Kong and French Vietnam and able to control them from left to right. Its coastline has ten important ports, now fallen into the hands of the Japanese.

The above reports, the two subjects and contents are vastly different, and are indeed two separate things. What can be discussed together is whether the European war will eventually extend to the Mediterranean and even the Far East? Standing in the Far East and examining it, how should we respond?

Some modern theories, with complete arguments, seem to have formed an unbreakable principle: that world peace and security cannot be divided. This is one of the most convincing points made by modern thinkers. For example, after Japan launched a military invasion of China on September 18, because British Simons and others could not recognize that world peace and security cannot be divided, the world situation gradually deteriorated over nine years to this day, and Britain has suffered a threat that it has not experienced in more than 800 years. The connections, the past routes, are extremely reasonable developments of facts and trends, which best illustrate the essence of the principle of indivisibility. From this point of view, Italy's inability to stay out of the war and its inevitable participation, and the inability of the European war and the Far Eastern war to maintain their independence and their inevitable merging, are all matters of course, but only a matter of time, almost a kind of destined fate. However, time and space often give humanity good opportunities through their gaps, and human wisdom should be able to preserve and continue life while peace and security have not perished. Just as what is said that the Italian Prime Minister will state today, there is at least room for maneuvering today. The Italian Prime Minister can indeed enable Italy to continue to maintain its isolation from the European war for the time being, rather than necessarily declare war today. Generally speaking, Italy does have emotions and ideas that are close to being unbearable; however, regarding Germany, there may still be agreements that are a thousand times better; regarding Britain and France, not only has the diplomatic route not been cut off, but it cannot be said that the door for negotiation has not been opened. Even in terms of Italy's so-called natural desires, the Italian government and people have repeatedly expressed them in various different ways, but they still retain their formal and public most serious way. Then, to predict today's declaration of war today, although possible, although there are signs, isn't it too early? Isn't it too much? As for how Italy should side with Britain and France or Germany, the matter is for the Italians to choose; however, how Italy should prevent the scope of the European war from temporarily extending to the Mediterranean today, that is, how the peace and security of the Mediterranean should be temporarily preserved in the flames, is also up to the Italians to decide, and is also what the world hopes from the Italians. The benefits and consequences of this are extremely far-reaching, and it is not only those standing in the Far East who have such feelings. Also, such as the report that Germany intends to borrow Hainan Island, if the report is true and actually becomes a reality, then its surface is another suffering of attacks by Britain and France, its form is another rise of international flames of war, its problem is another link in the Far Eastern disputes, and the nature of its facts is that Germany and Japan form an allied country and the scope of the European war extends to this corner, and merges with the Far Eastern war. It is difficult to be sure, but we not only stand in the Far East, and hope that things do not come to this for the sake of the interests of the Far East, and hope that Germany does not have this intention for the sake of Germany during and after the war, but also measure it with common sense: it can be asserted that the report is fundamentally unfounded. This is nothing else, if Japan provides Germany with any military bases, it will be that Japan's attitude towards Germany and Britain and France is determined: it must be known that Japan's determination of its attitude is initially not judged by the friendship and interests between Japan and Britain and France, nor is it based on the friendship and interests between Germany and Japan, but only depends on Japan's courage and strength towards the United States; Japan is stuck in the quagmire of China, and it is fundamentally insufficient to talk about courage towards the United States. Therefore, the Japanese side has no such thing. Germany has great ambitions and gnashing its teeth at Britain and France; however, in the things that it is currently striving for in military strategy, it is important to concentrate all its strength, in order to give Britain and France a fatal blow in one fell swoop, and Britain and France rely on overseas sources, which are very many and very large, Hong Kong and Vietnam are small, which are not in Germany's current stage of goals. In the international policy that it idealizes after the war, one is the resources that it can dominate independently, and the other is the market for free development, so there are many ways to communicate with China, and there is a conflicting situation with Japan; it once showed goodwill to Japan, both because it was needed before the war for diplomatic maneuvers, and also hoped that it could go to the enemy together during the war, and now, the situation is completely different. Therefore, the German side has no such thing. According to this kind of thing, it can be known that the global situation, if it is allowed to be stimulated and shaken without end, then because the world's peace and security cannot be divided, even if it affects the other side of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, why only the Mediterranean and the Far East: if all parties make good use of their wisdom, then when this European war has not yet extended to the Mediterranean, they will jointly seek to shorten the time of the European war, and when this Far Eastern war has not yet merged with the European war, they will jointly cut off the wings of aggression, then the restoration of world peace and security does not necessarily have to wait until the world has suffered a great catastrophe.

### Abe's Activities in China Have Made No Progress; Japanese Newspapers Criticize One After Another, Urging Speedy End to the War

Tokyo: Since Abe arrived in Nanjing, negotiations on the issue of adjusting relations between China and Japan have not yet begun. Newspapers here have been criticizing one after another recently. "Asahi Shimbun" stated that Japan's policy of quickly resolving the "China Incident" should be implemented more vigorously after the establishment of the Wang Jingwei regime, but there has been no major progress so far, and the reasons for this are still unknown. The European war has now expanded, and it is very dangerous for the Japanese authorities to only see its benefits and not its drawbacks. No matter how the European war turns out, the Japanese government must do its best to seize the opportunity to resolve the China Incident as much as possible, otherwise, it may be too late. "Kyoto Shimbun" also stated that it is still unknown what kind of activities special envoy Abe is currently carrying out in Nanjing. It is rumored that he will go to North China and Mongolia, but this is probably not credible. In short, the official negotiations have not yet begun, which is not in Japan's interest after all. (Havas dispatch on the 22nd)

Tokyo: Asahi Shimbun published an article arguing that Japan must end the "China Incident" as soon as possible and occupy a solid position in the European war. When the world's affairs are finally resolved, Japan seems to be like a child sucking its thumb, abandoned by others, and has no right to speak. If the European war continues to proceed at the dizzying speed it is today, Japan will soon not be able to fill the gaps with elderly generals, as France is doing today.

### Drastic Changes Occurring in Japan's Domestic Situation; Minister of Justice Advocates Eliminating Harmful Ideas

Tokyo: The Ministry of Justice convened a meeting of judges and prosecutors from across the country on the 19th. Minister of Justice Hisada Kimura delivered a speech, advocating clearing up heretical doctrines that harm the country and society and safeguarding true Japanese thought. He said, "Drastic changes have occurred in the domestic situation. Since the government has tightened restrictions on the economy, the general public has felt pain. Therefore, some people have been seduced by foreign organizations, and cannot avoid going astray, attempting to disturb the thoughts of the people in the rear. However, the people in the rear should have sound thoughts during wartime. All of you are judges and bear even greater responsibilities. The urgent task is to eliminate communism and ideas that harm the country and society, and to prevent the staff of various radical groups from having room to operate. In short, I firmly believe that the Japanese people will be able to overcome various difficulties and will not be seduced by such heresies." (Havas dispatch on the 22nd)

Tokyo: "Yomiuri Shimbun" recently stated that the Japanese government is currently planning to dissolve various labor unions so that they and the employer organizations, that is, the "Greater Japan Industrial Association," will be merged into the "National Industrial Service Movement" held by the government.

### Kobayashi Directly Admits: Southern Expansion Blocked, China's Strong Resistance Deals a Blow to Japan

Tokyo – General Kobayashi, the Governor-General of Taiwan, arrived here the day before yesterday and gave a speech to the press, stating, "I have served as Governor-General for four years. Rumors of my impending resignation are only natural. If a suitable candidate is found, I intend to retire, but this is not under consideration at the moment. As for Taiwan's position, it has undergone significant changes since the outbreak of the 'China Incident.' Taiwan is the core of our country's southern expansion, and it is essential to develop southern China and the South Seas in the future. However, Japan is currently constrained by the Chinese resistance and does not have the spare capacity. Once the pressure from the Asian continent eases, we should concentrate all our efforts on implementing the southern expansion policy. My purpose in returning to the country this time is to inform the government of this intention. As for Taiwan's internal affairs, the most urgent task is to develop electricity. However, due to a lack of raw materials, especially iron, cement, and other materials, the results of our implementation of this plan are not very satisfactory. In addition, we also plan to establish a shipping company to completely manage Taiwan's maritime transportation and acquire the ships of Nippon Yusen Kaisha, Osaka Shosen Kaisha, and other companies that operate in Taiwanese waters."

It is rumored that the Allied forces will launch a large-scale counteroffensive soon. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)

Abbeville Falls; Boulogne Also in Danger

London - Prime Minister Churchill declared in the House of Commons today that German armored units have broken through the French lines and penetrated the rear of the Allied forces in Belgium, and are now attempting to obstruct their transportation. Abbeville has now fallen into enemy hands. Fierce fighting is taking place around the city and at Boulogne. The outcome of the coastal battles is not yet predictable, but it is undoubtedly serious in nature. General Weygand, the Commander-in-Chief, is now directing Allied forces in an effort to restore and rebuild their united front. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)

London - British Secretary of the Navy Churchill declared in the House of Commons that German forces have attacked Boulogne, and fierce fighting is taking place there. Boulogne is an important French seaport between Arras and Abbeville, a military stronghold, and the closest route to Folkestone in England. (Associated Press dispatch, 23rd)

War Report from the German Side

German High Command - The German High Command released a war bulletin this afternoon stating that in Flanders, German forces attacked the enemy across the Scheldt River with considerable success. The battle of Valenciennes continues. German forces have control of the forest area southeast of Valenciennes. Enemy mechanized units attacked German lines twice yesterday on the Cambrai front, but were repelled with heavy losses. German forces west of Artois continue to advance towards Calais. On the line from the Somme River to the Meuse River, the enemy is taking a defensive posture. The second line of defense of the Liège fortress has surrendered to German forces. They captured twenty officers and 650 soldiers. The enemy on the Namur front continues to defend several forts. In the air, German aircraft bombed enemy rear areas and retreating units in Flanders and Artois. German fighters and reconnaissance planes sunk three transport ships and one oil tanker near the English Channel and bombed Dunkirk and Dover. German torpedo boats sunk an enemy destroyer near Dunkirk. Due to inclement weather, both sides' air activities were hindered. The enemy lost nine aircraft, and five German aircraft are missing. A combat cruiser of the enemy near Narvik was hit by one shell in the bow and suffered heavy damage. One transport ship was sunk, and another was damaged. German aircraft also attacked ammunition depots, harbors, artillery batteries, and reinforcements. British aircraft bombed the towns of Nijmegen and Waalwijk in the Netherlands, killing several civilians. From the 10th to the 15th of this month, German anti-aircraft batteries shot down a total of 342 enemy aircraft. (Haitong dispatch, 23rd)

Berlin - German military circles announced last night that German troops have occupied positions along 50 kilometers of the English Channel and are gradually encircling one million Allied troops in the Flanders and Artois areas. The battle for Ghent in the Flanders and Upper Scheldt area had not stopped yesterday, "but it is believed that resistance can be annihilated within a few days." The military circles also said that the cut-off British and French forces in the north are making every effort to break through the German defenses in order to escape to Arras and Amiens in the south. They denied the French claims that Arras had been recaptured. Unconfirmed German reports stated that German troops had occupied Soissons and were advancing rapidly towards Paris. The resistance of the Allied forces encircled in Flanders and Artois is "extremely stubborn, including the most elite units of France." (Associated Press dispatch, 23rd)

Berlin - Senior German military officials, in an interview with a reporter from the Haitong News Agency, made the following remarks supplementing the German official report: The most important fact of the Western Front situation is that the area between the English Channel and the North Sea coast and the German front line is becoming smaller. The isolated French and Belgian troops in this area are still resisting fiercely. Motorized units have repeatedly attempted to break through the encirclement but have failed. British tank units are also participating in the fighting. In general, the enemy forces trapped in the north are not only numerous but also extremely well-equipped, including several divisions of France's most elite troops and a large portion of their mechanized units. Therefore, there will inevitably be fierce battles in this area. So far, all British and French attempts to break through have failed. British and French mechanized units are inferior to Germany's in both strategy and technology. The rumors of enemy counteroffensive victories and the lack of fuel for German mechanized units are completely untrue. (Haitong dispatch, 23rd)

London - German radio warned the national public this morning that the decisive battle had not yet begun. A reporter declared that the fierce battles on the Western Front are continuing and that the enemy is resisting fiercely. The decisive battle is now approaching. As for the war situation, it is best not to publish it while military operations are in progress. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)

Berlin - According to sources here, in the past 24 hours, the German army has occupied positions extending 50 kilometers from the mouth of the Somme River along the English Channel to Laon. The German-occupied area along the English Channel extends to Montreuil in the north. The center of the fighting has now shifted to Flanders and Artois, and major battles are expected within days. (Haitong dispatch, 23rd)

German Vanguard's Whereabouts Uncertain; Somme River Battle Still Chaotic

London - Important battles were reported to have taken place between Cambrai and Valenciennes yesterday. British troops in various places are holding their front lines with light casualties. The number of German troops engaged is unknown, but the battles are said to be the most important of yesterday's fighting. British troops between Arras and Douai have launched a counterattack, but the results are not yet known. Belgian troops have also launched a counterattack against German troops who forcibly crossed the Lys River at two points, with considerable success. There are also Allied operations in the Arras area, but they do not seem to have provoked any German reaction. The situation between Arras and the Somme River is still chaotic. German light mechanized units are continuing to advance, and their advance points are now reaching south. French main forces on the Somme and Aisne Rivers are still holding their ground. Allied new Commander-in-Chief General Weygand returned to Paris last night after inspecting the country and the northern war zone of France, expressing satisfaction with the morale and material equipment of the troops, and seeing that the hard struggle of the past two weeks has not diminished the fighting spirit of the troops. Military sources in close contact with General Weygand say that the situation is still serious, but the main force of the German army has not consolidated the land occupied by its mechanized columns. The vanguard of the advancing German troops consists of motorized units equipped with automatic weapons. They cannot occupy land or hold it. Even very small units of French troops can drive them back, but these units are extremely mobile and their whereabouts are uncertain, like cavalry in the past. According to news received in London, it is known that Hitler has launched his last desperate gamble on the Western Front because he can no longer struggle through the winter. It is rumored that 500,000 German soldiers have been lost. Germany, the Soviet Union, and the Balkan Peninsula have encountered severe cold and floods, so there is no hope of harvesting much grain. Germany has gained little in Denmark. It is expected that 20% of Danish livestock will be slaughtered due to lack of feed. Danish agriculture is now on the verge of bankruptcy. Foot-and-mouth disease is rampant in various parts of Germany, and vaccines for treating the disease cannot be obtained. Furthermore, the lack of labor and the mechanization of industry make agriculture difficult for Germany. The military authorities are transferring freight cars from Romania to be used on the Western Front, reducing their ability to transport goods from the Balkan Peninsula to Germany. Moreover, due to the invasion of Belgium and the Netherlands, it is no longer possible to obtain gasoline from those two countries. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)

Rome - A special correspondent of the Italian Stefani News Agency telegraphed this morning that General Weygand's current strategic objectives are twofold: first, to adjust the new French defense line, concentrating troops along the Somme, Aisne, and Meuse rivers; and second, to rescue the British, French, and Belgian troops trapped in the Flanders and Calais areas. Therefore, Weygand ordered the troops in the Péronne area to launch a fierce attack to the north, and ordered the trapped troops to attack south to achieve a pincer effect. However, the German army responded effectively. In some areas, German heavy tank columns, with the cooperation of armored vehicles and bombers, penetrated deeply into the positions of the French and Belgian armies. German paratroopers also performed very well in combat. Many means of transportation and routes were destroyed, causing the Allied forces to feel they were in a dilemma. British armored units near Arras fought bravely, but after a fierce battle, more than half were killed or wounded, and they ultimately failed to succeed. French and Belgian troops also suffered heavy losses. (Haitong dispatch, 23rd)

Rome - A special correspondent of the Italian Stefani News Agency telegraphed that there is fierce fighting in the Flanders and Calais areas. Allied forces are trying to fight a bloody path towards the coast, but the surrounding German forces are tightening the encirclement. German mechanized units, military aircraft, and paratrooper units are cooperating effectively, completely controlling the battlefield. Although the Allied forces are trying hard to find the weak points in the entire German line, in order to implement a strategy of breaking through at a certain point, the German army, no matter where it is attacked, responds with a lightning-like counterattack, leaving no opportunity for them to take advantage of. The fighting is especially fierce in the areas of Valenciennes and Arras. The British Air Force is still active, but the fighting power of the army is very weak. Due to the low birth rate of the French population, the French army participating in this war is 700,000 fewer than in 1914. If the 400,000 French troops fighting in the north are annihilated, coupled with the heavy losses suffered on other fronts, then the number of French troops will face the danger of being outnumbered. (Haitong dispatch, 23rd)

Milan - The Milanese newspaper "Il Popolo d'Italia" published a telegram stating that General Didelet, who had served as the military attaché at the French Embassy in Germany, was captured near Valenciennes. (Haitong dispatch, 23rd)

### General Gort Still on the Front Line

London - British Prime Minister Churchill, accompanied by advisors from the Army, Navy, and Air Force, went to Paris yesterday to confer with Prime Minister Reynaud and General Weygand, the Allied Commander-in-Chief of all war zones, and returned to London that night. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)

### Large Squadrons of British Bombers Fly to Germany to Drop Bombs; Intense Air Battles in the Belgian, French, and Norwegian War Zones

London - The British Air Ministry announced last night that British bombers hit military targets and key points, bridges, railway junctions, and trains with many bombs. Last night, British planes also bombed Stavanger airfield. When the British planes flew away, the airfield was seen engulfed in flames. Yesterday, our fighters spent the day protecting British bombers over the war zones of Belgium and northern France, engaging in multiple engagements. At least twenty-four enemy aircraft were destroyed or heavily damaged. Eight British fighters are missing. Only five aircraft from the large numbers of planes sent to bomb northern France, Belgium, and the Scandinavian Peninsula yesterday day and night did not return. British planes attacked with three objectives last night: (1) to bomb roads in Namur and Dinant and bridges over the Meuse River; (2) to attack trains on the west railway line of the Rhine River, derailing them; and (3) to destroy railway centers east of Pool, junctions, and army gathering places. A train with military supplies on the railway line between Aachen and Kleve was bombed four times in minutes by Hampton-type British bombers. The first batch of bombs destroyed the rails in front of the train, stopping it. Then, they used parachute flares to fly low and bomb and strafe. Another train near Krefeld was hit by a bomb, and the main railway south of Gelsenkirchen was also hit by a bomb at a height of 600 feet. Also, an army gathering place near Aachen was hit by thirty-six high-explosive bombs. A train with military supplies near Erkelenz was attacked by a Hampton-type British bomber, and two long sections of freight cars exploded immediately. According to a communiqué describing the situation of the British planes attacking the German vanguard on Tuesday, when viewed from above, the German vanguard was advancing rapidly and had caught up with the refugees on the road, making it difficult to distinguish them from the refugees. It was also seen that there were forty to fifty German trucks on a certain road, mixed among pedestrians, ambulances, civilian cars, and bicycles. Two Blenheim-type British planes saw a column of enemy armored vehicles three miles long and flew low to bomb them, seeing the column catch fire. British planes also intercepted a mixed column of enemy armored light tanks and escorting motorized vehicles advancing rapidly on the main road north of Abbeville, with considerable success. Another armored vehicle column, some of which were hidden in a forest near Abbeville, was heavily bombed by eleven Blenheim-type planes, dropping over 150 bombs, exploding near both sides of the column. British planes also flew to key points to bomb key roads and railway bridges, aiming to prevent military supplies and reinforcements from reaching the enemy's front lines. British planes encountered anti-aircraft guns and pom-pom guns (Maxim-type long-range automatic rapid-fire guns mounted on mobile carriages) and concentrated rifle fire all day long. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)

Berlin - Military authorities here announced last night that, due to the rapid progress of the German army, the positions of the various armies are changing at any moment, so the military reports from various parties cannot arrive on time, especially the situation of the anti-aircraft artillery teams in the enemy's territory. The German High Command has not received detailed reports, so the German High Command has now decided to publish the reports in stages after receiving reports from that party. For example, it was previously reported that from May 10 to 15, the enemy's aircraft were shot down by German anti-aircraft batteries a total of 143. Now, gathering detailed reports from all parties, the enemy's losses amount to as many as 342 aircraft. According to investigations, the German anti-aircraft batteries have shot down one-fifth of the total number of enemy aircraft from May 10 to 15. (Haitong dispatch, 23rd)

### Refugees Gather Outside Paris

Paris - Yesterday, reporters saw countless refugees on the outskirts of Paris, swarming in from Belgium and northern France in an endless stream. It is said that these people not only find it difficult to rest on the way, but also lack food. After passing through the routes bombed by German planes, most of these five or six thousand people lost their wives and mothers lost their sons. The expressions of these people seem to be dazed, and no one shows any signs of crying or disappointment. One refugee in his thirties, originally a farmer west of Brussels, told the reporter, "I am now alone. My wife and two children are unable to move. My grandparents, who are over eighty years old, have been taken care of by others. I cannot say what my family is facing now." A ten-year-old girl who fled from Maubeuge said that she had come here hastily with her mother, and was repeatedly strafed by air force machine guns on the way. Fortunately, she was not injured, but there were piles of corpses in a certain forest, and they stepped over the corpses to pass, which was extremely terrifying. (Associated Press dispatch, 23rd)

### French Naval Department Announces Losses of Warships

Paris - The Naval Department released a communiqué stating, "Our navy lost the submarine "Dules," the destroyer "Lanterneau," and the supply ship "Minerve" while fighting off the coast of the Dutch Islands and Flanders.

### British MPs Concerned About the Situation in Northern Ireland

London - A Reuters correspondent stationed in Parliament stated that the possibility of German invasion of Northern Ireland has aroused the concern of most members of Parliament. The issue was discussed at a meeting of Conservative MPs yesterday, and it was decided to request Prime Minister Churchill to discuss this matter, because there are still Germans remaining in Northern Ireland, especially the existence of the German embassy and the activities of the extremist elements of the Irish Republican Army, so this issue is considered very urgent. Churchill will be asked questions in the House of Commons today. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)

### Germany Appoints Dutch Financial Commissioner

Berlin - Officials here announced that the German side has appointed Herleat as the commissioner of the Dutch Central Bank and other financial institutions, supervised by the commander-in-chief of the German army in the Netherlands. (Haitong dispatch, 23rd)

### British Parliament Passes Emergency Powers Act, Grants Churchill Dictatorial Powers; Treason Punishment Bill Passes Third Reading in Lower House

London - Last night, Parliament passed the National Defense Emergency Powers Act with lightning speed, granting Churchill dictatorial powers. Both the upper and lower houses passed the bill in just two and a half hours. After the Royal Commission indicated royal approval, it immediately became law. This bill authorizes the government to amend existing laws through cabinet orders without submitting them to Parliament for approval. This method is similar to the "decree" system of various continental countries, aiming to grant the government sufficient power to adapt the entire British economy to win the war. When Lord Privy Seal Attlee initiated the passage of this bill in the Lower House, he explained that its purpose was to fully control manpower, land, banks, wartime industrial transportation, essential services, and luxury goods trade. According to Reuters' parliamentary lounge correspondent, the government's plans to control industry are very ambitious. Laborers are not only forced to transfer to wartime factories but also to land and coal mines. Control of agriculture will extend to tools. The expenses for the government to handle the transfer of laborers will be implemented by region. Existing union contracts will be maintained. However, due to the agreements with unions, there will be general accommodation for overtime rules. Wages and profits will all be under government control. The plan to control banks is almost complete. Currently, purely personal private property will not be subject to interference. However, the government, when necessary, will requisition various private properties such as cars, furniture, securities, and stocks with short notice. Among the proposed plans, the authorities have the power to forcibly evacuate civilians from certain areas when necessary. (Reuters dispatch dated the 23rd)

London - Sir Kintnersley, a director of the Bank of England, gave a speech yesterday, stating that he was instructed by Lord Privy Seal Attlee to guarantee that personal savings would in no way be affected by the Emergency Powers Act. (Reuters dispatch dated the 23rd)

London - A new treason bill aimed at prohibiting opposition to the government's war policies and prescribing the death penalty by hanging or shooting for espionage and disruptive behavior passed its third reading in the Lower House yesterday and has been submitted to the Upper House, where it will pass all stages today. Home Secretary Anderson explained that the purpose of the bill is to adjust the legal status and remedy some possible loopholes in existing emergency legislation. The most important point is that it is considered necessary to stipulate a method to allow enemy aliens to be tried by military courts in appropriate cases. However, any British or neutral national will still retain the right to a trial by jury. Labor MP Jones immediately interjected, asking about the issue of enemies arriving in uniform. The Home Secretary replied that if the country were invaded and ordinary legal procedures could not be enforced in areas of military operations, the authorities should have the power to deal with the various treasonous acts covered by this case. The currently stipulated method is to deal with this kind of situation. Labor MP Clynes and Liberal MP Mander both approved this bill. Attorney General Sir Somerville also spoke, expressing how the bill would affect German paratroopers. Those who do not participate in the attack but only hope to engage in espionage activities will be dealt with by the methods prescribed in this bill. However, those who land and participate in the attack, even if they are wearing civilian clothes, will be treated the same as attackers in uniform and at the same time will not enjoy the benefits prescribed in international law for soldiers in uniform. (Reuters dispatch dated the 23rd)

### British MP Ramsay Imprisoned

London - During today's session of the Lower House, the Speaker read a letter from Home Secretary Anderson stating that, in accordance with the powers granted by the Defense General Regulations, Member of Parliament Captain Ramsay was detained in Brixton Prison this morning. Ramsay belongs to the Unionist Party and was born in India in 1894. He served in France during the last World War and was severely wounded. He retired in 1920. According to the Home Secretary in the House, this was a precautionary measure. Ramsay has the right to appeal to the Advisory Committee. (Reuters dispatch dated the 23rd)

### U.S. Congress Reviews Armament Program; Base to be Established in Guam; Senate Authorizes President to Control Defense Funds; Army Expenditure Passes with Unprecedented Figure

Washington - As the U.S. Congress is expeditiously reviewing President Roosevelt's proposed $3,000,000,000 armament program to enable the U.S. to hold the leading position in world aviation, congressional military experts today studied the acquisition of new U.S. defense bases in the South Pacific. Some here predict that the defense program will immediately establish air force and submarine bases on Guam, 1,200 miles south of Yokosuka, Japan. However, construction funds have not yet been allocated by Congress. Yesterday, the Senate gave the President a blank check of $132,000,000 without a recorded vote for the needs of promoting U.S. defense. Observers indicated that Congress's granting the President the power to freely control defense funds signals that the President may heed the Navy Department's urgent request to immediately develop Guam. Congress today studied consulting with Britain to obtain new Pacific bases, especially Christmas Island, Fanning Island, and other islands in the Phoenix Islands. A naval officer predicted that the dispute between Britain and the U.S. over the sovereignty of islands in the South Pacific will be re-examined by the two countries due to the needs of U.S. defense and the situation in Europe. The Senate Naval Committee quickly reviewed the $750,000,000 bill submitted on Tuesday, authorizing the government to establish air force bases and naval outposts around the U.S., with one-third of the funds allocated to the Pacific. When the Senate passed the $132,000,000 Army bill yesterday, it rejected the Republican proposal to establish a joint committee to monitor its use, allowing the President to control the funds to meet urgent needs. The Senate Naval Subcommittee passed a $1,458,000,000 naval supplementary bill, including $250,000,000 in cash, for the need to purchase new aircraft and build new warships. The Senate also re-debated the remaining portion of the $1,823,000,000 Army supplementary bill yesterday, which will be passed this week. (United Press dispatch dated the 23rd)

Washington - The $1,823,254,624 bill for U.S. Army expenses and expansion was unanimously passed by the U.S. Senate yesterday. Its magnitude and speed of passage are unprecedented in peacetime. The passage of this bill indicates that President Roosevelt's proposed $3,282,001,352 program, aiming to make the U.S. impregnable against any aggressor, has been fully supported by Congress. The Army expenses passed this time include $103,300,000 for future aircraft purchases. In addition, it will be used to purchase 2,566 new aircraft, massively mechanize the Army, increase the facilities for training aircraft pilots, and add anti-aircraft guns, light artillery, and essential military supplies. After the Senate passed this bill, it immediately prepared to begin considering the $1,458,756,728 naval expansion bill tomorrow, including a reserve fund of $472,776,000, which was included in the bill by the Senate Appropriations Committee today. (International News Service dispatch dated the 23rd)

Washington - The Senate Naval Appropriations Subcommittee has approved an additional $478,000,000 for the Navy supply bill to fund the Navy's recruitment of 25,000 new personnel. This move by the Subcommittee was first approved by President Roosevelt over the phone. Currently, the total amount of funds obtained by the Navy under the defense expansion program is $1,464,000,000, while the Army's is $1,823,000,000. The Subcommittee's action was subsequently approved by the Naval Committee. A Navy Department spokesman told a Reuters reporter that the total number of Navy recruits will increase from 145,000 to 170,000. At the same time, the House Naval Committee unanimously approved a bill to increase the naval air force to 10,000 aircraft and 16,000 pilots. The bill also proposes an appropriation of $144,000,000 for the construction of naval bases. The Senate passed the $1,823,000,000 Army appropriations bill yesterday, including most of the soft items requested in President Roosevelt's emergency defense bill. Currently, this bill has been sent back to the House for amendment. When the bill was passed in the Senate, it stipulated 2,566 military aircraft, a large number of air defense weapons, tanks and flat-trajectory guns, and the funds to increase the Army's peacetime strength from the current 37,000 to 280,000 personnel. (Reuters dispatch dated the 23rd)

Washington - Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Stark told the House Naval Committee yesterday that a blitzkrieg attack on the U.S. is within the realm of possibility. Therefore, he requested the committee to authorize the Navy Department to rapidly increase naval aircraft to 10,000. He said that the Navy Department is "very confident" in the strength of certain surface warships but still needs a strong air force to enhance the "certain aspects" of the Navy's offensive capability. He added that a blitzkrieg is indeed "possible in the event of an emergency." He said that if the German air force can exert greater power, no British ships will be seen on the sea. The new model of aircraft immediately adopted by the Navy will be kept secret, and he indicated that the Navy Department opposes selling the current new model to the Allied Powers. (United Press dispatch dated the 23rd)

Washington - President Roosevelt said in his message to Congress yesterday, "The startling results of international events have necessitated a review of the various measures needed for national security." He requested Congress to approve the transfer of immigration and naturalization matters from the Department of Labor to the Department of Justice, saying that this move would enable the government to quickly deal with aliens whose actions conflict with the public interest. (Reuters dispatch dated the 23rd)

Washington - The Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted 12 to 1 yesterday to temporarily table the resolution proposed by Democratic Senator Pepper that the U.S. should sell any available military aircraft, cash on hand, to the Allied Powers. (Reuters dispatch dated the 23rd)

### U.S. Senator Refutes Lindbergh's Speech

New York - Senator Pepper responded last night on the radio to Colonel Lindbergh's broadcast speech last week criticizing the government's defense measures. It is generally believed that this represents the official government response. Pepper said that Lindbergh's qualifications to discuss foreign policy are no better than those of any other transatlantic aviator. The "Fifth Column" is already active in the U.S., and anyone who hinders the government's efforts to protect the American people, whether intentionally or unintentionally, is an effective sympathizer of the "Fifth Column." When Lindbergh said "No one wants to attack us," was he speaking on behalf of Hitler or Goering? In the current situation, can Americans accept this young gentleman's guarantee that "If we do not seek war, it will not come to us"? Pepper also responded to Lindbergh's criticism that the U.S. lacks a clear defense policy, saying that in the past two years, President Roosevelt has repeatedly declared his policy of defending the Western Hemisphere, which is a practical defense policy that has long been concretely formulated. Pepper continued by addressing Lindbergh's sarcasm that those who worry about being invaded are neurotic, saying that he believes we should thank God for finally making America feel the danger and resolutely arm ourselves for self-defense. Pepper also warned Americans that if the British Navy is forced to surrender, Hitler will likely have a navy superior to that of the U.S. Pepper finally mentioned the Japan-Germany alliance, saying that if the naval forces of Japan and Germany cooperate, he does not know whether we can rely on Lindbergh's guarantee that war will not come to America.

### Turkish President Reaffirms Determination to Defend Nation; Vigorously Safeguards Balkan Status Quo; Maintains Close Contact with Soviet Union

Paris - Turkish President Inonu reaffirmed Turkey's determination to maintain the Balkan status quo yesterday when he met with Taylor, a reporter for "Paris Soir," in Ankara. President Inonu stated that Turkey strongly opposes any adventurous attempts in that area. He told Taylor, "If Turkey does not declare its insistence on adhering to the Allied Powers to maintain the Balkan status quo, what would you think of the position of Romania, Yugoslavia, Greece, and Bulgaria, which are surrounded by Germany and Italy? We have mutual interests. The failure of the Allied Powers is our failure." After broadly discussing the situation in the Near East, General Inonu stated that the Allied naval reinforcements in the Mediterranean have improved the confidence of the Balkan countries. When the reporter asked about the position of Bulgaria and the Soviet Union, "The President replied that Bulgaria has repeatedly stated its guarantees of goodwill and peaceful intentions. The Soviet Union is currently very silent. We have frequent contact with them, but we cannot know their ultimate goals." Taylor stated that the impression he got while staying in Ankara was that Turkey was deeply relieved that the German army was advancing northwest instead of taking action in the Balkan southeast, as they could drag out time and complete national defense measures. (United Press dispatch dated the 23rd)

### Pope Receives U.S. Envoy to Discuss Peace; Italian Prime Minister's Attitude Hesitant; Not Prepared to Speak

Vatican City - Pope Pius XII recently held a meeting with Taylor, the special envoy sent to the Vatican by President Roosevelt, for three quarters of an hour.

It is also reported that the Vatican and President Roosevelt are currently attempting to make efforts for peace and hope that the Italian Prime Minister can participate in the peace work beforehand. (United Press dispatch dated the 23rd)

New York - Famous reporter Simms recently sent a telegram from Paris stating that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini is not very happy with Germany's rapid progress and is also feeling anxious about President Roosevelt's repeated appeals for peace. Is he truly leaning towards Germany, or does he agree with President Roosevelt's proposal? He is currently wavering between the two, unable to decide. (United Press dispatch dated the 23rd)

### Anglo-Soviet Trade: Negotiation Process Officially Announced by the Soviet Union

Moscow: Regarding the progress and nature of the preliminary Anglo-Soviet trade negotiations, many reports in foreign newspapers are untrue. In this regard, TASS is now officially authorized to state the following:

(1) In the autumn of 1939, British Foreign Secretary Halifax indicated to the Soviet Ambassador to the UK, Maisky, that the British government was willing to begin negotiations on a trade agreement with the Soviet government. The Soviet government replied that it agreed in principle to conduct these trade negotiations. However, on the other hand, the British government took various steps to reduce and restrict trade with the Soviet Union, such as canceling Soviet orders for industrial products from the UK, detaining ships and goods bound for the Soviet Union, and adopting a hostile policy towards the Soviet Union during the Soviet-Finnish War, leading to the expulsion of the Soviet Union from the League of Nations, with the UK playing a leading role. All of these factors prevented the smooth progress of the negotiations.

(2) After the signing of the Soviet-Finnish peace treaty, British Under-Secretary of State Butler, on March 18, 1940, again suggested to Maisky on behalf of the British government that trade negotiations be reopened. On March 27th of the same month, Maisky replied to Halifax, stating that if the British government was truly sincere in resolving Anglo-Soviet trade issues and released the Soviet ships "Salenga" and "Mayakovsky," which had been detained by the British authorities, before the negotiations began, the Soviet government could agree to reopen the negotiations. On April 19th, Halifax replied to Maisky with a British government response. In this response, the British government expressed its willingness to understand the Soviet government's exact proposals for a trade agreement, and at the same time requested the Soviet Union to guarantee that all imported goods could only be used for its own consumption and not temporarily transported to Germany. In addition, the British government conflated the Anglo-Soviet trade agreement with restrictions on Soviet trade with Germany. On April 29th, Maisky delivered the Soviet government's response to Halifax, with the following key points:

(A) The Soviet Union is a neutral country and has traded and will continue to trade with both neutral and belligerent countries. These trade activities are based on the Soviet Union's own needs for import and export goods.

(B) The Soviet Union has a trade agreement with Germany, which the Soviet Union has fulfilled and will continue to respect. The Soviet Union believes that the German-Soviet agreement should not be the subject of negotiations in discussions with third countries. At the same time, the Soviet Union does not want to use trade agreements signed by Britain with other countries as the subject of the current bilateral negotiations.

(C) The Soviet government is willing to restore trade relations with Britain on the basis of reciprocity, but the conclusion of such a trade agreement must not violate either party's trade obligations with other countries. When negotiating a trade agreement with the British side, the Soviet Union was indeed prepared to import goods from Britain for its own use and had no intention of re-exporting the imported goods to Germany.

(D) The best prerequisite for Anglo-Soviet trade agreement negotiations is the release of the Soviet ships "Salenga" and "Mayakovsky," which have been detained by the British authorities.

(3) On May 8th, Halifax sent a memorandum to Maisky, expressing his views on the Soviet government's response of April 29th. In this memorandum, the British government did not put forward any specific proposals, but raised new questions regarding German-Soviet trade relations as follows: the content of the German-Soviet trade agreement, the quantity and conditions of Soviet goods transported to Germany, restrictions on Soviet war material transported to Germany, and the possibility of controlling goods transiting through the Soviet Union to Germany, the use of goods imported by the Soviet Union from Britain, and the Soviet Union's market in Germany, etc. Regarding the detention of the two Soviet ships (the goods carried on the ships were bound for the Soviet Union), the British government did not give a clear answer, only stating that the ships had been transferred to the French government and suggesting that the Soviet government establish an agreement on the control of contraband. In the memorandum, Halifax solemnly stated that the British government intended to make Anglo-Soviet trade relations conform to Britain's war objectives.

(4) On May 20th, Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov replied to Halifax's memorandum of May 8th. In this reply, the Soviet government solemnly declared that the Soviet Union would never subordinate its trade policy to the war objectives of any country. The Soviet Union is a sovereign country and can absolutely engage in trade with neutral or belligerent countries on the basis of reciprocity and equality. The new questions regarding German-Soviet trade raised by Halifax in his memorandum of May 8th are beyond the Soviet government's power to answer and cannot become the subject of bilateral trade negotiations.

Regarding goods imported from Britain, the Soviet government stated on April 29th that these goods were for the Soviet Union's own use and were never transshipped to Germany. As for the British explanation for the detention of the two Soviet ships, it did not convince the Soviet Union. The Soviet government believes that the British government should bear full responsibility for this action. The Soviet government believes that the British government's raising of questions that the Soviet side is unable to answer proves that the British side has no sincerity in conducting trade negotiations with the Soviet Union. (TASS dispatch on the 21st)

London: Reuters diplomatic correspondent learned that the Soviet Union's reply to the British note on Anglo-Soviet trade negotiations was delivered to the British Foreign Office last night and is now being considered by the British government. (Reuters dispatch on the 23rd)

### How to Fix a Wine Bag and Rice Sack

— (An)

"Wine bag and rice sack" is a phrase that, to others, is a curse, meaning someone who only knows how to eat and doesn't know how to do anything. In reality, "wine bag and rice sack" clearly refers to the "stomach." People with stomach problems are desperately hoping to become wine bags and rice sacks, but unfortunately, their stomachs are already damaged, often aching, feeling sour, inflamed, and bloated, like being stabbed or rotting.

### New York Tycoon Arrives in Shanghai; New Yorkers Covet South America; U.S. Should Devise Sound Strategies at this Critical Juncture; Two Italian Ships Continue to Sail to the Far East

New York tycoon Howard Ember arrived yesterday from the U.S. aboard the President Hoover. He told reporters, "I would like to warn Americans that if the United States allows Germany to achieve absolute victory in Europe, South America will inevitably be threatened by Germany. Germany will use South America to recover the losses caused by the war, and the expansion of German economic power will be difficult to contain thereafter. So, whether through military action or other technical methods, Germany will one day become the ruler of South American countries." He believes that the U.S. should establish air bases in South America, but the terrain of South America poses many obstacles to this.

Germany Has Potential Power in South America

Germany's coveting of South America is not a recent phenomenon. Although its industry has been almost completely destroyed by the war, it can be quickly restored with great force once the war ends. Before the outbreak of the war, Germany's trade position in South America was extremely stable. The U.S. completely adopts the principle of cash payment for trade with South America, while Germany does not. Therefore, South America also has a good impression of trade with Germany. At the same time, German exchange in South America also receives preferential treatment, which is more convenient than U.S. exchange. The U.S. does not need South American commodities very much. Therefore, he doubts whether the U.S. can compete with Germany and seize a superior position in trade with South America. Germany's trade with South America is mainly in pig iron products, and a monopoly has been formed. Most of its necessities, such as wheat, meat, and oil, can be adequately supplied by South America. Even in South America, the number of German immigrants is quite considerable, forming a strong position.

Close Trade with Britain

In peacetime, South America welcomes trade with Britain the most. Britain has purchased 60% of its required goods from South America and hopes to improve the situation in South America. Therefore, the trade relationship between South America and Britain is very close, because Britain needs South America to supply various raw materials, and South America needs Britain to supply various machinery.

German Spokesperson Said Yesterday

The spokesperson of the German Embassy in China, in a press conference yesterday, in addition to stating the latest war situation in Europe, also explained the recent reports in newspapers about German planes bombing refugees, women, and children. His words were quite humorous. According to the spokesperson, "When German planes bombed the opponent's railway and highway transportation lines, it was inevitable that a small number of women and children who were fleeing on the road would be affected, but there were definitely not as many refugees killed and injured as reported by the Allied powers." The spokesperson also said, "The German side has notified the people of the other side that they can still live in their homes when the German army arrives and do not need to escape," etc. His words seemed to blame the local people for taking refuge as an unnecessary move, and the unfortunate "affected" by German planes bombing was "self-inflicted."

Two Italian Ships Sail to the Far East

According to the Italian Mail Ship Company yesterday, the company has received a telegram from Trieste, Italy, that the Italian mail ship Conte Rosso has sailed from there to the Far East. At the same time, the company's mail ship Conte Verde is also on its way to the Far East and has already departed from Bombay. Therefore, Italian ships have not been affected since the Western Front war expanded. According to the company's manager, Indiponte, yesterday, the sparse number of passengers in Trieste may affect the voyage of Conte Verde. He believes that the expansion of the war to the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, and France will indeed reduce the number of passengers. Whether Italian ships can make a profit by continuing to sail on this route is still a question.

Belgian Fundraising Achieves Great Success

Since the local sculptor Zhang Chongren and others initiated fundraising to help the Belgian Red Cross with medical expenses, the response has been very enthusiastic. Belgian Ambassador Guillaume, because of this act of sympathy from people of all circles in China, attached even greater importance to it. Yesterday afternoon at 4 p.m., he accompanied his wife and entourage to Zhang's residence at 608 Route Pères, to visit. He praised and encouraged Zhang and his students' work very much. Zhang and the ambassador met while Zhang was studying in Belgium and obtained the Belgian King's Gold Medal. Zhang is the first Oriental artist to receive such a medal from that country. Therefore, the ambassador was very impressed by the regulation that Zhang would paint an oil painting for those who donated more than 1,000 yuan this time. The Belgian Red Cross fundraising has been very successful. As of recently, it has collected a total of 91,275.50 yuan in Chinese currency, 520 US dollars, 2,500 French francs, 18 pounds and 1 shilling in British currency, and 105,350 Belgian francs.

All Parties Provide Relief to Dutch Refugees

As of the 22nd, the local fundraising for Dutch refugees has collected a total of 58,590 yuan in Chinese currency, 10 pounds in British currency, and 100 US dollars. Sassoon Bank donated 15,000 yuan, Mr. Spielman 10,000 yuan, Dutch Chargé d'Affaires in China Vlas 3,000 yuan, and Dutch Consul General in Shanghai Baasfan 2,000 yuan.

### Haifu Wheel Transporting Yangmi to Ningbo; Returned Yesterday

Japanese Marine Police Searched and Detained the Vessel, Negotiated by Our Side on Reasonable Grounds

The gentry and merchants from Ningbo residing in this city, due to the shortage of rice in various counties of Ningbo this year and the great panic among the people, after discussions between people from Shanghai and Ningbo, decided to raise 2 million yuan to purchase Yangmi (foreign rice) in Shanghai and transport it to Ningbo for relief. All the rice had been declared separately and transported out of the country in batches. The day before yesterday, another 2,000 bags of Yangmi were entrusted to the German firm Lihe Yanghang's Haifu Wheel to be loaded to Ningbo. When the barges were being transported to the outer edge of the Haifu, a number of Japanese military police from the Marine Corps suddenly came forward to stop it and seized 1,600 bags of Yangmi, forcing them to be barged to the Japanese military police's berth at the Waterfront Hotel. After learning of the news, the shipowner reasoned with the Japanese side that the Yangmi was purely for the relief of the people of Ningbo and that it had been declared for export in accordance with the customs regulations, and the procedures were completely legal, requesting its return. According to the reporter from Daguan News Agency, the Japanese side's detention of the Yangmi bound for Ningbo was reportedly due to the suspicion that the Yangmi was for military use. However, it has now been clarified that it was indeed for civilian relief, so it was all returned yesterday.

### China-Thailand Relations Are Cordial; Rumors of Anti-Chinese Sentiment Are Groundless; There Were No Such Demonstrations at All

Siamese Minister to the United States, Mr. Miralemon, on his way to Washington to take office, passed through Shanghai yesterday aboard the President Taft. He solemnly refuted the rumors circulating abroad that the anti-Chinese movement in Siam was rampant, saying, "There is absolutely no anti-Chinese demonstration in Siam. The rumors circulating abroad are purely fabricated. What has been discovered in Siam from time to time is only the arrest of criminals who smoke opium, etc. Siam has never had any demonstrations against any country." Mr. Miralemon continued to describe the friendly relations between China and Siam over the years. Currently, there are a large number of Chinese residing in Siam. As for the anti-Chinese sentiment in Siam, he believes that it may be due to the fact that the Siamese government slightly increased the business rights, and most of the Chinese in Siam are businessmen who feel unhappy about this move. The overseas Chinese are trying their best to negotiate. He also believes that China has always adopted a friendly attitude towards Siam over the years, and Siam is also very willing to repay China with a friendly attitude. Therefore, anti-Chinese demonstrations are definitely not the case. Finally, he stated that Siam is now working hard to take the opportunity of the European war to find ways to renew itself.

### Business Representatives from Various Countries Stationed in Shanghai Express Their Recent Views; U.S. Chamber of Commerce Secretary Praises International Trade; British Advisor Says "No Time to Think About Business"; French Counselor Says French Concession Has Neutrality

Since the start of the United States Foreign Trade Week, American expatriates in this city have been celebrating enthusiastically. Yesterday, the Rotary Club hosted a grand luncheon at the Capital Hotel. At the banquet, the secretary of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce,

Mr. Smith, gave a speech, saying, "International trade is the lifeblood of all countries. We should have a deep belief in this concept, and we must work early to alleviate the pain of the inevitable post-war recession." He said, "Today's countries, including the richest United States, can rarely survive and prosper without relying on international supply and foreign trade. International commerce makes each other mutually beneficial, using one country's surplus to compensate for the other country's deficiency."

Mutual assistance and exchange benefit each other and satisfy human desires. The recent European war has not had a significant impact on the United States' foreign trade. On the contrary, it has made its trade more prosperous." Mr. Smith also talked about the United States' policies of restricting imports and controlling exchange rates, believing that these policies are good strategies to restrict personal interests and excessive development. British Commercial Advisor

Mr. Hegginson's speech imitated a general in the last European war, saying, "Food, food, in wartime, how can I think about food?" and said, "Business, business, in wartime, how can I think about business?" The commercial counselor of the French Embassy said in his speech, "France currently relies on foreign supply in many ways. Therefore, foreign concessions in France should maintain their neutrality to gain the friendly feelings of the countries concerned. The Shanghai French Concession authorities have been governed by this principle for three years." Song also said, "Countries that love peace are truly commendable. Therefore, although Britain and France are at war, they still keep peace in mind. The United States and France are fighting for peace."

### Unpaid Income Tax Should Be Paid Quickly

Can Go Directly to the Shanghai Office of the Bank of China to Pay

Since the withdrawal of the Chinese army to the west, most patriotic businessmen and people in this city have continued to pay government income tax as usual to value national tax. However, according to recent investigations, a few unscrupulous people are trying to evade paying this national tax. The Shanghai Office of the Income Tax Department of the Ministry of Finance, in view of this, will start an investigation. Once found, in addition to paying the tax monthly in the future, they will also be required to pay the unpaid tax in full. It is hoped that the businessmen and people in this city who have not paid the tax in accordance with the regulations will automatically go to the Shanghai Office of the Income Tax Department of the Central Bank to pay the tax.

### Editor of a Pro-Japanese Magazine Embarrassed in the United States

According to the Miller's Review, published today, a reader wrote to the editor of the newspaper, saying that the newspaper's previous list of pro-Japanese newspapers and magazines still had omissions. "China Digest," edited by Caroline, is also one of the pro-Japanese magazines, but it was not included. Although few people in this city read it, the magazine is funded by the Japanese and mailed to various parts of the United States in no less than several thousand copies. Caroline is now traveling and lecturing in the United States, doing her best to defend Japan. Recently, in New York, she gave a disgusting pro-Japanese speech to the press. The audience questioned her on the spot, demanding that Caroline register with the State Department in Washington as a "Japanese propagandist."

### Shanghai Municipal Council Finance Committee Adjusts Salaries

Meeting This Afternoon

The English-language "Ta Mei Evening News" reported that, according to a member of the Shanghai Municipal Council, the meeting originally scheduled for the 22nd has been postponed to the afternoon of the 24th. Therefore, the salary increase proposal for Council employees has not yet been decided. It is said that the Finance Committee's discussion on the 24th will focus on a 25% salary increase for general employees and a readjustment of the grade "A" employee's six-cent ten exchange rate convenience.

### Ningbo Decides to Levy Relief Fees; Ningbo Native Place Association Cables Again to Stop It; Currently Working Hard to Raise Funds to Bear the Relief Fees; Fellow Villagers Express Displeasure Upon Hearing of Increased Water Freight

The Ningbo Chamber of Commerce and the People's Food Relief Committee decided to increase the water freight for all incoming and outgoing goods by 50% from the 25th of this month. The Ningbo Native Place Association in Shanghai has already cabled to request the cancellation of the original decision. The association cabled the Ningbo Chamber of Commerce, the People's Food Relief Committee, Commander Guo, and County Magistrate Yu yesterday, as follows:

Disguised Additional Levy

(1) Ningbo Chamber of Commerce and People's Food Relief Committee, According to reports from the shipping industry, the people's food relief fund will increase water freight for all incoming and outgoing goods by 50%, which will be implemented from the 25th of this month. Our association does not agree with the disguised additional levy to raise relief funds, which only increases the burden on the poor. We have already telegraphed our opinion. According to reports, your office must still implement this method. Our association's intention is not adopted, which is deeply regrettable. We hope that you will reconsider and stop it, and we look forward to your reply. Respectfully, Yu Hede, Ningbo Native Place Association in Shanghai

Hinders Fundraising

(2) Respected Ningbo Commander Guo and County Magistrate Yu, According to Ningbo's decision, the water freight for incoming and outgoing goods will be increased by 50% to finance the people's food relief. At a time when the people's livelihood is declining, how can we further increase the burden on the people? Our association has cabled to request the cancellation of this resolution, but it has not been adopted. Fellow villagers in Shanghai are working hard to raise funds to bear half of the relief funds. Upon hearing this news, they all expressed displeasure, which greatly hinders the progress of donations. We hope that you will order the prevention of its implementation. This is our sincere plea. Yu Hede, Ningbo Native Place Association in Shanghai

### British Association Resolutions

The British Association held a meeting the day before yesterday, and it is said that two resolutions were passed: (1) Expressing support for the "Daylight Saving" promotion to be implemented by the Municipal Council. (2) Deciding to hold a semi-annual member meeting at the British Women's Association Hall on the Bund at 5:00 p.m. next month on the 4th to discuss issues such as British expatriates in this city above the military age needing to join the volunteer army.

### New Rules for Mail to Europe

No Compensation for Losses, Remittances Require Permission

After the sudden outbreak of the European war, postal delivery between Shanghai and Europe was not without difficulties. However, the Shanghai Postal Administration decided to find ways to facilitate delivery. All mail and packages to Europe are still forwarded via the Pacific and Suez lines, and airmail is transported via six lines. Recently, mail to Europe has increased significantly, but packages have decreased. The details are recorded as follows:

Requires a Permit

Yesterday, a reporter from the New Voice News Agency visited a senior official of the Shanghai Postal Administration, who said (1) All banknotes or cash of that country and Italy sent by post to Albania are prohibited. Also, all bank drafts, various checks, remittances, and other valuable documents, savings books, treasury bonds, stocks, and their interest coupons, issued in Albanian francs or Italian currency must be accompanied by a permit from the National Bank of Albania before they can enter the country. Otherwise, in addition to detaining the mail, legal sanctions will still be imposed. (2) For packages sent to France, in addition to those containing gold, all other packages containing goods must obtain a permit from the French Ministry of Commerce in advance before they can be imported. However, this does not apply to packages sent to individuals that do not contain trade characteristics. However, there must not be multiple packages sent by the same sender to the same recipient.

Losses Are Inevitable

(3) For packages to Austria, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Germany, the sender must bear the responsibility. (4) For insured letters sent abroad containing currency, the sender must indicate the type of currency contained in the envelope, such as French currency, Japanese yen, etc. Those that do not clearly indicate the contents, (5) For mail sent abroad, the name and address of the recipient should be written in the common language of the country of destination. If only Chinese is written, Roman characters must be attached. The sender must strictly follow the instructions and bear the responsibility. The official continued that the European war is becoming more intense, so the loss of mail may be unavoidable. However, the Post Office has clear regulations (1) If the delivery of mail is due to natural disasters or events that cannot be resisted by human forces, (2) If the loss occurs within a foreign country, the Post Office is not responsible for compensation in accordance with the laws of that country.

### The Aviemari Ship Sailed Directly to Ningbo Yesterday

The Aviemari ship of Fuxin Gold Company sailed directly to Ningbo yesterday. The ship has spacious cabins and is very suitable for transporting cargo and passengers. Its berth in this city is at the Astronomical Observatory Wharf. The loading and unloading of cargo and passengers are convenient, and the Taichangxiang Warehouse adjacent to the wharf is especially convenient for loading and unloading passengers and goods. The general office of Fuxin Company is located on the second floor of the Zhonghui Building on Avenue Edward VII.

### Untagged Price Vendors: Authorities Implement Public Prosecution; Ineffective Warnings Lead to Legal Action; Foreign Food Prices Decline

Mainland reports state that the Shanghai Municipal Council (工部局) is vigorously cracking down on merchants engaged in illegal profiteering. It will initiate public prosecution against twenty vendors who have failed to mark the prices of their goods early next week. According to a member of the Price Equalization Committee, this move by the Shanghai Municipal Council marks the beginning of more forceful action against those who illegally raise the prices of food and goods. In the future, any shop owner who refuses to mark the prices of goods will also be brought before the court. The Shanghai Municipal Council has repeatedly warned these twenty vendors, but they have turned a deaf ear. Therefore, the decision has been made to resort to legal action. The reason why this action was not taken earlier was to allow merchants sufficient time to prepare price tags and other procedures, and to make them understand that the Shanghai Municipal Council would keep its word.

Price Regulations

Although the French Concession Public Works Bureau (法租界公董局) has not yet initiated public prosecution against any merchants, the action of the Shanghai Municipal Council is in cooperation with the Public Works Bureau, so it is expected that the French Concession will take similar action soon. At the same time, inspectors from the Shanghai Municipal Council continue to inspect markets and shops within the concession to see if they are complying with the regulations set by the Bureau for the sale of food. However, the Shanghai Municipal Council has not yet regulated prices, so there has been no action taken on the issue of different prices for the same item. It is believed that customers will naturally purchase from store A if they see that its price is lower than store B, which will prompt store B to reduce its price. With the recent rebound in the value of the legal tender (法幣), food prices in the city showed a downward trend yesterday. For example, the prices of butter and alcoholic beverages, which are everyday foods for foreigners, have already fallen.

Quality and Weight

The French Concession Price Equalization Committee held a meeting at the French Concession Public Works Bureau on Avenue Joffre (霞飛路) at 4:00 PM yesterday. More than ten Chinese and French committee members attended. They discussed in detail the quality and prices of daily necessities for Chinese people, such as rice and coal, and daily necessities for Westerners, such as bread and meat. It is reported that the French Concession Public Works Bureau will pay close attention to whether the quality and weight of daily necessities are commensurate with their prices, and will impose penalties for any deception or trickery. As for the reports in Western newspapers that the Price Equalization Committee will establish a special apartment committee to handle rental disputes and crack down on key money (挖頂費), this discussion was not brought up yesterday because the issue is complex and Chinese cases are usually handled by the French Court, while lease disputes involving foreigners are handled by the French Consulate.

Bread Too Expensive

According to foreign sources, the French Concession Price Equalization Committee held a meeting yesterday afternoon. During the meeting, committee members felt that the price of bread, which is currently selling for 50 cents per pound, seemed too expensive. Therefore, they decided to contract a baker to specialize in baking a new type of bread with a lower price, setting the price at 35 cents, for use by the troops stationed in the city. As for the establishment of a "Foreign Merchants' Market," it is reported that the Committee has postponed its implementation. However, before the "Foreign Merchants' Market" is established, a strict inspection of the quality and prices of daily necessities sold in stores will be carried out to ensure that prices are not too high and affect the livelihood of ordinary people.

### British Scouts Celebrate Queen's Birthday

Today is the birthday of Queen Victoria of Great Britain. The British boy and girl scouts in the city will gather at the British Consulate at 8:00 AM to hold a flag-raising ceremony, presided over by the British Consul-General George. The Consulate will also host a breakfast to entertain guests. The Shanghai Club will also hold a celebration at 12:20 PM to 1:30 PM today.

### British Ship Elsie Moller Requisitioned to Hong Kong

According to shipping industry sources, the British merchant ship Elsie Moller, owned by Moller & Co., has been requisitioned by the British naval authorities and ordered to sail from Shanghai to Hong Kong. It has already sailed to a designated location last week to await orders. The ship is leased to shipping companies operating between Shanghai and Chemulpo, with a deadweight of over 800 tons.

### Removal of Barbed Wire at the Intersection of Boone Road and Wenchow Road

The area on North Kiangsi Road (北江西路) in the Jia District (甲區) of the north bank of Suzhou Creek, which has been blocked by the Japanese with barbed wire since last autumn, has only left two gaps at Haining Road (海寗路) and Boone Road (文監師路) for pedestrians to enter and exit, making traffic extremely inconvenient. Starting yesterday, the barbed wire fence in the middle of the Boone Road gap on North Kiangsi Road has been removed by Japanese soldiers, so cars and cargo trucks can now pass through the gap without obstruction. However, according to a reporter from Datong News Agency (大通社) who inspected the area yesterday, although the barbed wire fence in the middle has been removed, there are still very few vehicles entering and exiting.

### Snippets from the Flower Show

The chaotic and noisy scene transforms into a quiet and fragrant atmosphere. This is the first impression that the 64th Flower Show at the Race Club gives to visitors upon entering.

Under the early summer sun, watching a few horses lazily circle around in the opposite yard, head to tail, stepping out of the empty and desolate arena into the flower-filled display room, looking around, it seems that everything is still, yet everything is full of life.

The sounds of conversation and footsteps from the visitors interweave together, floating in the light, warm, and soft air. It seems that everyone's heart is immersed in the fragrant and rich floral nectar, involuntarily making people intoxicated.

Yesterday was the last day of the show, and there were still many visitors. In two corners of the room, thick and dense flower mountains were arranged, labeled "Produced by the Shanghai Municipal Council" (工部局出品). The flowers were clustered together, a riot of colors, a collective performance of flowers, it can be said that it wins by "quantity."

This part includes genera such as Platycodon, Rorippa, Iberis, Chrysanthemum, and perennial chrysanthemums. There are many technical terms that are difficult for laypeople to understand, like holding a doctor's prescription.

The violets produced by Mr. Zhou, from the Violet Nursery, who won the Grand Championship twice and the Peter Grand Silver Cup – the meticulous work of my colleague Zhou Shoujuan (周瘦鵑) – are the most likely to attract the attention of visitors.

Mr. Zhou's works are all exquisite and delicate. On the central table, a "Banana Buddha" (蕉卜達摩) is enshrined in the center. The giant banana is shrunk into a pot, a true spectacle. Below is a pot of "Oars Returning to the Boat" (款乃歸舟). In the shallow pot, mountains and rocks are arranged, and short trees grow in the crevices of the rocks. Next to it is a cluster of verdant grass, like reeds. A leaf-shaped boat is placed in the middle of the stream, very lovely.

The table on the right is labeled "Eight Treasures" (八珍) – representing the materials for eight potted plants – including: jade, stone, porcelain, copper, brick, sand, bamboo, and wood. Planted inside are Impatiens balsamina, mountain stones, monthly roses, honeysuckle, Kerria japonica, Myrsine africana, bamboo, and pansies.

The small items displayed on the left, many small toys are placed on the miscellaneous shelf, including a small maple bonsai, two and a half inches tall, small grass, elm, Jasminum nudiflorum, Pinus thunbergii, cypress, Myrsine africana, and crabapple. These small plants are all planted in specially selected pots, expressing the planter's skills in an ancient atmosphere.

In addition, there are Ganoderma lucidum-shaped small elms, half of which are red estrildids, climbing roses, and Jasminum nudiflorum; Virginia creeper on stones, ginkgo, pine deer, and Linaria – flowers like small wisteria, fragrant.

Located in the center, overlooking everything, is a honeysuckle in an ancient tripod, swaying gracefully, with a unique style. Visitors admire Mr. Zhou's works very much.

Other exhibits include bonsai and potted plants by Kong Zhiqing (孔志清); various flower arrangements in vases, table decorations, and horticultural products. Except for Mr. Kong, who is Chinese, all other products are made by Westerners. Many of the children's works are from students in schools, the youngest being under eight years old. Their displays are naturally simpler and more unadorned. (E.L.)

### Puppet Officials Entering Concessions Should Seek Self-Defense; Shanghai Municipal Council Responds to Assassination of Xie Zhiting with Letter to Puppet "Government"

Regarding the assassination of Xie Zhiting (謝芝庭) in front of the Metropolitan Dance Hall on the evening of the 6th of this month, the puppet "Municipal Government" (偽「市府」) sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Council requesting the arrest of the perpetrators. It is now known that the Council has replied. The translation is as follows:

Facts of the Case

In response to your letter of the 8th of this month regarding the shooting of Mr. Xie Zhiting, "Councilor of the Municipal Government," in front of the Metropolitan Dance Hall on the evening of the 6th of this month, this Bureau is aware of the incident and expresses its regret for such an unfortunate event. Recently, political and other armed crimes have been repeatedly seen in this city. This Bureau is deeply concerned and hopes to obtain the cooperation of all parties so that the state of security and order expected by both forces can be restored. The facts of the case are as follows: Mr. Xie was a regular customer of the Metropolitan Dance Hall. On the evening of the 6th of this month, before 11:00 PM, he was at the entrance of the hall, about to board a chartered car, when he was shot three times by a Chinese man. Afterward, the assailant, along with three accomplices, fled along Gordon Road.

Council's Opinion

This Bureau expresses its sincere regret for this case. However, for the benefit of all parties, this Bureau must inform your "Municipal Government" that in the future, personnel of your "Municipal Government" entering the Public Concession must seek appropriate methods of self-defense. The Police Department of this Bureau will provide protection to the best of its ability, but the Department requires cooperation. Many personnel of your "Municipal Government" often enter and exit public places at night without taking self-defense measures for their own safety, and the Police Department has not been informed of their actions. In view of the foregoing, in addition to ordering the arrest of the perpetrators, we hereby respond for your information.

### Abandoning a Corpse: Gao Binjun Interrogated and Awaiting Judgment

Gao Baojun (高寶鈞), a native of Jiangbei, is 37 years old and runs a rickshaw hostel at No. 433 Lane, Latourelle Road (拉都路) in the French Concession. Yang Jiachen (楊家臣), a 52-year-old rickshaw puller from Jiangbei, lives in Shanghai alone and resides at Gao's place. Recently, he suddenly fell ill and died on the morning of the day before yesterday at 2:00 AM after treatment proved ineffective. Unexpectedly, Gao did not make arrangements for a coffin but wrapped the corpse in straw mats and discarded it outside the lane about four or five houses away at dawn. After seeing it, the constable reported to the police station, who dispatched detectives to investigate. They learned that the corpse had been carried out and abandoned by Gao. Because he violated the regulations and acted against humanity, Gao was detained in the police station. At the same time, Yang's corpse was sent to the Tongren Fuyuan Mortuary for examination. Yesterday, a report was made to Prosecutor Zhao of the Second Special District Court, who came to the scene to examine the body and ordered it to be handed over to the Charity Hall for burial, pending identification by relatives. In the afternoon, the police station escorted Gao to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court. The police station lawyer filed a lawsuit against him for the crime of abandoning a corpse and explained the case. Subsequently, the investigating officer reported the discovery and arrest of the defendant. Gao Baojun confessed that he had no ability to purchase a coffin, so he carried the corpse out and abandoned it. Judge Zhang Minsheng reviewed the confession and ordered the case to be closed. The defendant was detained to await a judgment.

### Injured While Riding a Bicycle: Run Over by a Truck

Li Hongxing (李鴻興), 38 years old, from Tianjin, lives at No. 3, Dongmingde Lane, Route Massenet (馬浪路) in the French Concession. Yesterday afternoon around 4:00 PM, Li Hongxing rented a bicycle from a nearby bicycle shop and had his nephew, Li Songyu (李松雨), five years old, sit on the front bar of the bike. Li then rode the bike back and forth on Route Massenet. While passing Rue Paul Beau (蒲柏路), a truck from a certain company came speeding by. Li was unable to avoid it in time and was knocked to the ground. Both Li Hongxing and Songyu were run over. Seeing that he had caused an accident, the truck driver sped away. Nearby Chinese police arrived and sent the two to the hospital for treatment. It is said that Li Hongxing suffered minor injuries, while the child Songyu's injuries were severe and life-threatening.

### Dancer's Dance Tickets Stolen: Thief Returns Them Intact with Note Requesting Zhu to Exchange Them for Legal Tender; Police Wait in Ambush at Designated Location and Arrest the Thief

Zhou Meijun (周梅君), a 23-year-old local dancer at the Paramount Ballroom (仙樂舞宮), formerly a famous socialite, lives in Room 2, Second Floor, No. 976, Xingye Fang, Bubbling Well Road (靜安寺路). On February 20th of this year, after Zhou finished dancing and returned home, she suddenly discovered that all of her four hundred yuan in soft currency and seven hundred yuan in Paramount dance tickets were missing. At the time, Zhou did not report it to the police station. However, it is said that the Paramount Ballroom's dance tickets, priced at five yuan or more, are similar in style to banknotes, and the face of the ticket also indicates the denomination in yuan. The thief mistakenly thought they were legal tender and stole them as well. Later, after realizing that they were dance tickets and could not be cashed in, he returned more than five hundred yuan worth of dance tickets in a letter the other day. However, in addition to stating in the letter that he had mistakenly stolen the dance tickets and expressed his deep apologies, he also asked Zhou Meijun to exchange them for two hundred yuan in cash, and put them back in the original letter, and place them on the landing of the stairs downstairs, where he would come to pick them up, otherwise she should be careful of her life, etc. Zhou then reported it to the Bubbling Well Road police station, who dispatched detectives Lu Yunmai and Liang Junshan to Zhou's residence to wait in ambush. At the same time, Zhou was instructed to still place a bundle of dance tickets, covered with a one-yuan legal tender note, in the letter and place it on the side of the stairs. At around 7:00 PM the night before last, Zhang Zhancai (張展財) and Wang Yuelian (王月連), both from Yangzhou, came to pick up the envelope.

Captured by Detectives

They were arrested and taken to the police station. It was discovered that Zhang was the son of the maid hired by a Filipino musician named Fei Liebin (斐列賓) in Room 1 on the first floor of the apartment building. He was ordered to be detained. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The police station lawyer, Zhang Tianyin (張天蔭), stated the case and requested detention. According to Zhou Meijun's complaint and questioning of Zhang and Wang, their statements were evasive. The court ordered them to be detained and interrogated again in seven days.

### Zhao Hongxing Foundry Privately Melts Copper Coins for Profit; Many Copper Coins and Copper Ingots Confiscated; Factory Owner and Apprentice Arrested

In the past, the types of currency in our country were simple, with only silver and cash. Since the casting of cash was taken over by the government, unscrupulous people, in order to make a profit, secretly bought large cash coins and recast them into small cash coins. The government, considering these traitors to be harming the country and the people, strictly prohibited this, and offenders were punished with the death penalty. Until the late Qing Dynasty, the copper coin was born, and one coin could be used as ten or twenty cash coins. If the large and small cash coins were recast into copper coins, the profit would be even greater. At that time, there were few civilians who did this, and most of them were openly set up factories and cast coins by warlords who controlled the region. Therefore, since the Republic of China, copper coins have flooded the market, especially in Sichuan, Hunan, and Wuhan. The exchange rate for each silver coin fell to as low as several hundred coins. A year before the August 13 Incident, the National Government implemented a currency reform and, because the types of currency gradually increased, in order to prevent unscrupulous people from counterfeiting and damaging them, it promulgated the Provisional Regulations on Currency System to supplement the small amount of crimes stipulated in the current criminal law. As the War of Resistance against Japan began and the European War followed, the value of non-ferrous metals rose immeasurably, which gave the traitors a great opportunity to make a fortune from the national crisis. They scoured around, and the copper coins worth ten or twenty cents each were privately set up furnaces to melt copper for sale, so that whether old-style copper coins or fractional copper coins have disappeared. According to various copper and tin shops, the current market price of this item is between 80 and 55 coins for each legal tender. Those who specialize in collecting copper coins for melting copper, because there is no large amount available in Shanghai, have even turned to the countryside and the occupied areas along the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines and the Yangtze River to collect them. It is reported that although there are still many places in the mainland where copper coins are used, the price has been raised due to the Japanese's eagerness to buy them. However, if they can be transported to Shanghai, they can still earn double the profit. However, those who specialize in this business also know that the national law is strict, and they have been melting them secretly. Therefore, although the police authorities have heard rumors, they have never been able to crack down on them. Until the day before yesterday, detectives from the New Market Police Station (新閘捕房) discovered that the Zhao Hongxing Foundry (趙鴻興翻砂廠) at No. 17, Lane 579, Mohawk Road (梅白克路) had set up a furnace to melt copper coins. They immediately reported it to the First Special District Court, and the court issued a search warrant and rushed into the factory for a detailed search.

Under Search

They discovered furnaces and utensils for melting copper ingots in the corner, and crushed copper and copper coins were placed next to the furnace, which were confiscated by the detectives. There were also 2,500 un-melted copper coins hidden under the bed, which were also found. The detectives then arrested the factory owner, Zhao Houlu (趙厚祿) from Hubei, and the employee, Qiu Kouzi (仇扣子) from Jiangbei, and escorted them to the First Special Court yesterday morning along with the evidence. The Shanghai Municipal Council's acting lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, filed a public lawsuit against Zhao and Qiu based on Article 2 of the Provisional Regulations on Currency System. The presiding judge believed that this case was important, and the criminals seemed ignorant. In addition to appointing a lawyer to defend them, he also explained the reasons why the new and old laws severely punished private melting of national treasures, and ordered them to truthfully confess how long they had been engaged in this illegal activity and how much profit they had made. Unexpectedly, Zhao only nodded and pleaded for leniency. After repeated questioning, he confessed to melting for six weeks, and that the copper coins bought for each legal tender could be sold for 1.8 yuan after being melted into copper ingots. When Qiu Kouzi was questioned, he confessed that the melting work was done by apprentices who assisted the factory owner and that he did not participate.

The Court's Interrogation Concluded

The court ordered a verdict to be announced on May 30. The copper items, etc., were stored in the warehouse, and Zhao and Qiu were escorted back to the New Market Police Station by detectives in a prison van for detention. This type of case is rarely discovered, and it is not as common as counterfeiting banknotes. It is expected that after the verdict, those who specialize in this business will know to be vigilant.

### Young Man Fang Caichun Arrested for Extortion

Rong Zhimin (榮志敏), the owner of the Yuanyue Hardware Store (源裕五金號) at No. 4, Lane 702, Peking Road (北京路), received a threatening letter from gangsters on the 14th of this month. The envelope was addressed to Wang Rujie (王如捷) from a certain number on Jessfield Road (極司斐爾路), and the letter inside was signed by Wang Rujie, the representative of the Shanghai Youth National Salvation Corps Ten Brothers Special Agent Party (上海靑年救國團十弟兄特務黨代表人). The letter stated, in essence, that Rong's business was very prosperous, so he was asked to subsidize the group's expenses with 20,000 yuan. He was asked to send the money to No. 76 Yuyuan Road (愚園路) on the 15th, otherwise his entire family would be in danger. Rong ignored it. Subsequently, he received a total of three letters. On the afternoon of the 22nd, Rong suddenly received a phone call from the gangsters, instructing him to send 300 yuan to the intersection of Avenue Foch (愛文義路) and Changsha Road (長沙路) by 5:00 PM. Rong instructed a representative to go, but no one came to contact him. Then, another phone call came, instructing him to send the money to the above location by 7:00 PM, and the person coming must hold a Sin Wan Pao (新聞報) in hand, with the words "Sin Wan Pao" facing outwards. Rong then reported it to the Old Market Police Station (老閘捕房), who dispatched Chinese detectives Sun Dafa (孫大發), Huang Cifu (黃賜福), and Zhou Zhengxing (周正興) to wait in ambush. As expected, a young man came and spoke with Rong's representative, and took the 300 yuan and was counting it when the detectives stepped forward and arrested the man. Upon questioning, he identified himself as Fang Caichun (方財春), from Ningbo, 18 years old, living at No. 30, Yu Gu Village, Yuyuan Road (愚園路). He was escorted to the First Criminal Court of the First Special District Court yesterday morning. The police station lawyer, Ru Baozhen (汝葆彝), requested permission for detention because further investigation was needed. Under questioning by Judge Jiang Shuzhi (姜樹滋), he was ordered to be detained and interrogated again on a later date.

### Jing Bao Suspended

The Shanghai Jing Bao (晶報) will be temporarily suspended starting tomorrow. The reason for the newspaper's suspension was notified to the newspaper by the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department yesterday, but the length of the suspension is currently unknown. It is reported that the newspaper was punished with suspension for publishing inappropriate advertisements for the Jing An Theater (靜安戲院) in western Shanghai.

### Shen Ganting Found Not Guilty of Imitating Needle-Making Machine

Since the outbreak of the European War, various foreign needles have become difficult to transport and production has decreased. Therefore, the business of domestic manufacturers has become several times more profitable. The Tiangong Needle Factory (天工製針廠) at No. 80, Route Conty (康悌路) in the French Concession, in order to increase its production, used a new type of machine. Yin Zhizhong (尹致中) from Shandong, of the Dazhong Industrial Society (大中工業社) on Route Cardinal Mercier (賈西義路), reported to the French Police Station that the Tiangong Factory's machine was similar to the CCY type three-speed machine that he had applied for patent protection. He accused Shen Ganting (沈幹庭), the manager of the Tiangong Factory, of imitating a patented product. The police station initiated a public lawsuit, and the first instance court sentenced Shen to six months of imprisonment, which could be commuted to a fine of two yuan per day. Shen refused to accept the verdict and hired lawyers Xu Wufang (許武芳) and Yuan Yang'an (袁仰安) to appeal to the High Third Branch Court, arguing that Shen's machine was very different from Yin's patented product, and that the three-purpose machine had long been used in Europe, America, and Japan, and that in fact, needle manufacturers in this city had this equipment. After a detailed investigation by the High Third Branch Court, it ruled yesterday afternoon, "Main Text" that the original verdict was revoked and Shen Ganting was found not guilty.

### Letters to the Editor

To the Editor, The section on social news on the 23rd of this month, "Yonghe Refinery Clearing Litigation," contains content that is mostly inconsistent with the facts. The case had been heard by the First Special District Court and the minutes of the shareholders' meeting had been presented in court, not specifically stipulating that the agreed price was between 18,000 and 20,000 yuan, and even authorizing the shareholders who were negotiating to have the power to represent the factory in making an offer. Shareholders Zhu Chunrong (朱春榮) and Zhu Qinzuo (朱欽祚) signed before and after the resolution, and therefore there was no way to quibble. The transaction price was indeed 20,000 yuan, which was proven by the lawyer of Liuming Company (麗明公司), Lu Jia. Ling Keming (凌克明), the original intermediary, also came to the case to make a statement, and the court's investigation found that Wang He'an (王和安) and Peng Xuehai (彭學海) were not guilty. We hereby report the facts for your information and hope that this letter will be published to make a correction. Wang He'an and Peng Xuehai, May 23rd.

To the Editor, I recently read the news column in your newspaper, which contained the article "Abandoning His Wife and Forming a New Relationship." It said that Fuhui Western Clothing Store (福惠西服店) was opened by Dong Yimin (董亦敏), which is deeply shocking. Our company is a partnership, and there is no Dong Yimin among the shareholders. I think it is a misrepresentation of rumors. I hereby write to you and hope that your newspaper will allow this letter to be published to make a correction. Fuhui Western Clothing Store, May 23, 1940.

### Finance: Foreign Exchange Shows a Hesitant Trend

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no changes in the official exchange rates. In the unofficial market for British and American currencies, fluctuations were mediocre, hovering around the levels of 41/125 pence and 5.5 yuan. Although news of the European war is still a concern for the general public, panic has decreased, and foreign banks' appetite for absorbing foreign exchange is quite strong, with active inflows and outflows. Therefore, there was no major reaction in trading. In the early morning, due to the repatriation of exchange, the British currency was tight and the American currency was loose. Later, due to the eagerness of foreign banks to supply foreign exchange and ample funds, the market situation hardened. From 9:40 AM, the exchange absorbed shillings, causing Chinese merchants to buy heavily, and the market turned tight. However, the situation was still calm at noon. The market remained calm in the afternoon. Although speculators were short, they were not important. Later, as Japanese merchants tended to sell, prices gradually loosened. As a result, the British exchange rate was 41/125 pence, and the American exchange rate was 5.5625 yuan, which was slightly tighter by 0.015625 compared to the previous day, while the American currency was harder by 0.03125.

This was due to the repatriation of exchange. After the opening, foreign bankers initially sold heavily, but Chinese merchants and speculators bought in, but the amount was small, so the situation loosened and hardened. It is estimated that foreign banks sold American exchange for June to Chinese merchants and speculators at 5.25 yuan. Soon, HSBC saw the cheapness and absorbed spot shillings, with a price of 41/15625 pence, which may have been a purchase on behalf of the Equalization Committee. HSBC's listing was announced as unchanged. The silver equalization tax was announced to be reduced by 7.75%. Subsequently, Chinese merchants and speculators saw HSBC's strong appetite for absorption and also increased their buying, so the market gradually tightened. It was first beneficial to sell American exchange for June to Chinese speculators at 5.21875 yuan. In addition, foreign banks sold American exchange for May to Chinese merchants at 5.4375 yuan. At that time, the spot shilling was the softest at 41/0625 pence, and the American exchange rate was also reported at 5.4375 yuan. By 10:30 AM, the situation stabilized, and the price hardened slightly. It is estimated that Hong Kong Telecom once sold American exchange for June to foreign banks at 5.25 yuan.

Japanese Merchants Slightly Selling

It is estimated that foreign banks sold 5.5 yuan for May and 5.25 yuan for June to Chinese speculators. Afterwards, it was heard that Japanese merchants were slightly selling, so the closing results showed that the market was slightly harder, with the British exchange rate at 41/125 pence and the American exchange rate at 5.5625 yuan, the British exchange rate at 41/109375 pence for this month, the American exchange rate at 5.3125 yuan, the British exchange rate at 39/953125 pence for next month, and the American exchange rate at 5.28125 yuan.

### Gold Market Fluctuations Have Been Small
### Only 140 Yuan of Ups and Downs Yesterday

Yesterday's cash gold unofficial market situation rebounded upwards. Observing the recent changes, it was like a tug-of-war, with alternating rises and falls. This was because the development of the European situation was difficult to predict, the exchange market reported frequent tightening and loosening, and the strength of the bulls and bears was even. Therefore, the market returned as soon as it fell, and rose again after returning. The buying sentiment was quite strong at the opening this morning, and the opening was 40 yuan higher, at 5800 yuan. Soon, money changers, securities firms, etc. were all entering, and although the bank's group was trying to sell, the buying spirit was higher due to the tightening of foreign exchange.

But at that time, although the securities gang and a certain money changer continued to absorb, there were still banks and gold shops selling a lot, so the market situation was slightly stable at that time. But soon the foreign exchange market suddenly tightened, and the buying wind gradually strengthened, and the sellers scattered, and the price soared by 100 yuan. The securities gang entered a bank for 30 taels at 5940 yuan. After this, the exchange market suddenly reported a hardening, the buying wind stalled, and a certain money changer turned from buying to selling, and gold shops and banks also came to sell, and it fell back by 125 yuan.

Yesterday's off-market securities trading was very quiet. The market situation was generally stable, akin to the stillness in foreign exchange and gold, a scene of all things silent, awaiting the rain. The dull situation remained unchanged throughout the day. One could say that foreign exchange and gold were waiting for Italy to express its position, but public bonds had no initial connection to this, yet they also tended to stagnate. The entire day's trading was particularly sluggish in the afternoon. The meeting lasted less than a quarter of an hour before adjourning. Price fluctuations were also minimal. However, the long-dormant 96 bonds saw one or two ten thousand yuan's worth of transactions, rising from four yuan eight jiao to five yuan.

For public stocks, conflicting news continued to emerge from Europe. The outcome of the war remains uncertain. However, overall, the situation seems to have improved somewhat. For the stock market to reverse its course amid this major downturn, it undoubtedly needs more decisive catalysts. Yesterday's trading was not deserted, and prices also saw slight improvements. Measuring by the profitability of various companies, the current stock prices are lower than their intrinsic value, which seems excessive. However, this point is not something that the average person is willing to research at the moment, as the very foundation of our entire civilization is currently being destroyed.

### Yarn and Cloth: Cotton Yarn Meets High Prices, Still Sees Hedging Sales; Yueqin Settlement Concluded

The yarn market is generally weak. Although there is no large-scale demand, sporadic purchases from Hong Kong are still decent, so sentiment remains stable. However, the overseas cotton industry situation is still in a state of decline, so some continue to hedge sell when prices rise.

The opening of the current yarn market was peaceful in sentiment. All aspects of materials have no bullish factors. In addition, the decline in Indian cotton is particularly fierce. Although buyers in the market are calling for higher prices, few are accepting them. The price of 20-count Double Horse was 1,325 yuan. Soon after, it was heard that foreign exchange was still loose, and it fell back to 1,280 yuan. Finally, with the support of Guangbang's sales channels, it saw another step up.

The amount of purchases from each gang is listed as follows:

It is heard that due to the large fluctuations in Japanese yarn Yueqin recently, in order to maintain the interests of the industry, the Fuguo Bureau has proposed appropriate measures for both long and short parties to settle prices to achieve a clear conclusion, and then resume operations.

### Indian Cotton's Decline Intensifies

Cotton trading is particularly lacking in development. This is because overseas cotton markets are volatile. Although American cotton is rising, Indian cotton is falling even more sharply, so people's emotions are mixed. Trading from all sides is very quiet.

### Food: Foreign Rice Rises Sharply, Exceeding One Yuan

The rice market opened weakly yesterday morning. Due to the difficulty in grasping the market trend, both buyers and sellers dared not act rashly. Whether actual sales or speculative transactions, there were few problems. Those holding goods slightly loosened their holdings, so each type of goods depreciated by two or three jiao, such as Xiaowen rice at 46.7 yuan and No. 2 Siamese rice at 46.5 yuan. However, almost immediately, the market was rumored to be serious about the European war, which will impose controls on the export of foreign rice from the production area. It was also heard that gold and foreign exchange were stable, which made people's hearts firm again. Most turned from selling to buying. Customers from the interior, such as Ningbo and Shaoxing, were particularly eager to collect, and the absorption of No. 2 Siamese rice, which has the cheapest price, was unabated, accounting for 5,000 to 6,000 bags. The total transaction volume for the entire day was more than 10,000 bags. The market price rose steadily after the opening in the morning. Xiaowen rice opened at 46.7 yuan and closed at 48 yuan at noon. In the afternoon, it opened at 48.3 yuan and closed at 48.6 yuan, which was a rise of 1.6 yuan compared with the closing price of 47 yuan the night before. Other foreign rice each increased by an unequal rate of one to one and a half yuan.

Although more than 1,000 bags of glutinous rice continued to arrive, due to seasonal factors, demand was particularly keen, so the selling price stepped up by about one yuan. Jinli special yuan has opened at 45 yuan to 44.5 yuan, Chang Danbai yuan at 43 yuan, medium grade at 41 yuan, and Jiangbei goods are also sold at 41 yuan to 40 yuan.

The supply of thick and thin粳 rice continues unabated. In recent days, the off-market trading outside the market has been sluggish. Due to the general high-quality goods, the market has been very expensive, and those who handle goods also feel that it is difficult to start, so the market situation is desolate and unremarkable. Wuxi Zhente Qingjing rice is still 51 or 52 yuan, and Fenjing rice is about 50 yuan. Other goods are similar.

The arrival of foreign rice in Shanghai was once interrupted, but recently it has been coming continuously. Yesterday, the Taikoo Company's Guangdong wheel brought 4,946 bags from Hong Kong, which arrived in Shanghai on the evening of the day before yesterday (22nd) and started unloading yesterday morning. In addition, the company's Nanning wheel arrived yesterday afternoon, also carrying 2,400 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong.

In the Wuxi rice market, in recent days, rice boats from all production areas have been arriving one after another. Due to the increasingly hot weather, the storehouse lenders have a strong desire to sell. Purchasers dare not enter too much. The sales volume of the company's door is limited, people's hearts are weak, and it has fallen back by one or two yuan. High-quality Fenbai粳 rice is 31 yuan per shih, high-quality rough粳 rice is 29 yuan, high-quality粳 rice is 14 yuan 6 jiao 5 fen per dan, and other miscellaneous grains have also fallen by two or three yuan.

### Inland Flour Rises by One Jiao

The flour market is slightly firm, because the retail transactions in this street are gradually active, and the price of rice is prosperous, and people's hearts are slightly improved. The disc price of the No. 2 flour mill is uniformly fixed at the original price of 13 yuan 8 jiao. The return goods of the old car have no transaction. The price of inland flour has also risen due to the reported increase in the Wuxi production area. Generally, the production in the area is limited. Once transported to Shanghai for sale, the local area is found to be in short supply. Therefore, the cargo side, after hearing the news, wants to wait and see and is unwilling to easily release the goods. As a result, the price of Shunfeng brand, etc., has risen from 13 yuan 3 jiao and a half to 4 jiao and a half, an increase of 1 jiao compared with the previous time. The total transaction volume is 5,000 to 6,000 bags. At the moment when the new wheat has not yet been released, there will be no major changes in the market. On the 24th, 3,000 bags of flour were shipped to Hong Kong.

Wuxi flour has been transported in recent days, the stock bottom is thin, and the market price has been revived. The price of flour on the day before yesterday rose from 12 yuan 7 or 8 jiao per bag to 13 yuan 2 or 3 jiao.

The cocoon lines in the Hangjia area are all in the hands of "Central China". Occasionally, there are merchants operating, but they must also obtain the consent of others. In addition, "Central China" feels that the cocoon price is too high and the profit is not abundant, so it intends to force down the cocoon price. Formal merchants cannot operate freely, and silkworm farmers cannot sell at a good price. All mulberry areas are complaining.

New York's silk market yesterday rose by 3.5 points in the near term and 6.5 points in the long term. Yokohama spot has no ups and downs, and the long term rose by 12 yuan, so the local silk market is relatively lively. Foreign firms are entering the market.

The total transaction volume is 100 dan of Baichang silk and 40 dan of Lizheng silk.

Artificial silk has arrived in Shanghai. The Italian wheel Contilachai brought 118 boxes from Italy on the day before yesterday, and the Guangdong wheel also transported 259 packages from Hong Kong yesterday, which is said to be Dong goods. (Yong)

Old News Re-Copied: Sixty-Seven Years Ago (393)

(See this newspaper from the 12th year of the Tongzhi era of the late Qing Dynasty)

### Cao Shaoyuan Travels Thousands of Miles to Find His Father

Cao Shaoyuan of Changli County is cautious, sincere, and honest. His father went outside Shanhaiguan to do business, and there was no news of him for many years. Cao Shaoyuan served his grandparents and mother with utmost filial piety. Every time he thought of his father, he would weep and lose sleep and appetite. Whenever someone came from outside the pass, he would repeatedly inquire about him, and repeatedly wanted to go find him himself. His grandparents initially pitied his youth and weakness and strongly dissuaded him. In the twenty-seventh year of Daoguang, Cao Shaoyuan was already strong and determined to find his father. He set off in August of that year. In January of the following year, he arrived at Sanxing and learned that his father was in the Russian country of Gangzhadega, commonly known as Wuzhijiang, more than 8,000 miles away from Sanxing. The area was densely forested and impassable by land. He followed the river by boat to the extremely cold northern part, where the river ice was tens of feet thick and only thawed in June. The locals used dogs to pull wood, dragging it on the ice like an ice bed in the interior, eating raw fish and wearing fish skin for clothing. When tired, they would lie on the ice bed or on the ice. Cao Shaoyuan endured hardship and finally arrived there in late April. In May, he found his father, who had been unable to walk for three years due to his plight. He wept and carried his father on his back to return home. At the end of the year, he arrived home, after seventeen months, traveling more than 20,000 miles back and forth. Everyone who heard about it praised him. Now, his grandparents are both deceased, and Cao Shaoyuan's hair is also gray. He earns a living by collecting firewood and is content with poverty. The magistrate of Lichang County personally went to inquire and provided him with millet every month to support him. Li Hongzhang, because he had not heard the teachings of poetry and books but was able to travel thousands of miles to find his father, specially requested that he be honored.

### Responding to the "Daylight Saving" Movement

— Zhi Zhi

The "Daylight Saving" movement recently launched by the Shanghai Municipal Council will be implemented from June 1st. This is worth promoting and is a meaningful movement that should be unanimously supported and earnestly implemented by the citizens of the isolated island today!

We know that after the "August 13th" bombardment, everything in Shanghai has been too abnormal. Looking at the people of all classes living in such an environment, they also lack good guidance and improvement. Their actions show a deformed reaction. For example, reveling in the song and dance stages at night and still snoring in the sun, and many other unreasonable behaviors, in a larger sense, reduce the efficiency of people's work; from a small perspective, it also hinders the individual's physical and mental health, and also increases the burden of another expenditure under the high tide of life.

Therefore, for the "Daylight Saving" movement promoted by the Municipal Council, all compatriots in the city, whether for private or public considerations, must unanimously respond, promote, and implement it. First, start by improving your physical and mental habits, develop good habits of getting up early and going to bed early, and after finishing work early in the afternoon, take this opportunity to do some indoor exercise, take a walk outside, in order to restore the tired body and mind all day, and at the same time get more time to read books, read newspapers, and other beneficial pastimes, etc. I hope everyone will resolutely and sincerely implement it thoroughly!

### Lightning-Fast vs. Snail-Paced

— Written by Ni Jiongxian

### Final Warning

— Jian Tian

Merchants who use foreign exchange as a "shield" have finally nakedly presented their ugly faces in front of every citizen, without any way to escape. However, the duck that is used to eating snails still has its last skill—hiding in the shed and making no sound, which is what is commonly called "making a fortune in silence." If foreign exchange is kept for a long time and not sold, and the increased prices are not reduced, what can you do?

It is naturally more than enough to deal with the city's citizens with this "tough" method, because in addition to shouting and anger, the citizens can only watch it hide in the shed and carefully chew the aftertaste of the snail, which does nothing to fill their empty stomachs. However, having lost the excuse of the "shield," there will eventually be a day when things are "handled according to the law." The Municipal Council has decided to file a public lawsuit against twenty speculative rice merchants in the middle of next week, and that is definitely not a joke.

In the past, the authorities admitted that they had failed in their work to suppress prices, precisely because the "shield" was hung high in front. They pretended to be legitimate merchants who were "seeking profit from their capital," and it was impossible to see their true faces through the shield. On the contrary, they even demanded "protection." Therefore, the authorities repeatedly stated that they would require citizens to assist them. If they discovered any instances of deliberately raising prices, they should report them immediately so that they could investigate thoroughly. This was a passive way to break through the "shield" individually. Some people thought that this was the authorities' perfunctory shirking of responsibility. I think that the difficulties of the officials should be forgiven. Now that the奸商 has revealed their true colors, won't the authorities immediately punish them severely?

However, judging from the situation, punishing one is perhaps not enough to warn a hundred for those who embrace the "make a fortune in silence" doctrine. All citizens should take advantage of this opportunity to work together. No matter how small the amount, even a jiao or a fen, if anyone is found to be deliberately raising prices, they should be reported immediately. When the authorities are determined to implement legal sanctions, they should ensure that those ducks who are used to eating snails are unable to wait quietly for digestion and are choked to death. That would be truly gratifying.

Finally, I would like to give a final warning to the ducks who have broken the "shield": now is the time to consider what "good strategies" you should use to cope with the coming of your doomsday.

### Elementary School Textbooks Are Indeed Being Downsized

— Naxun

According to a friend of mine who works at a certain large cultural institution, due to the rising cost of raw materials, their company is planning to downsize the elementary school textbooks, and he is currently in charge of this work.

They are not only downsizing them but also re-cutting and pasting them, removing the illustrations and arranging each line and each row tightly without leaving any space. The top and bottom margins have also been shortened a lot. However, according to the budget, there may still be a need to raise prices slightly.

Of course, on the bookseller's side, there may be reasons for such actions, and they may say that they are doing this to reduce the burden on students' parents.

However, this is actually increasing the burden on the students: because illustrations can not only arouse the reader's interest but also allow them to follow the clues and develop observation skills and strengthen reasoning. As for the sparse arrangement of rows and columns, this can reduce eye strain and prevent students from feeling bored and dull. Only the top and bottom margins seem to have no great use. If anything, they are only a matter of "beauty or ugliness," and now they are being treated equally.

I feel that at a time when schools across the country are unable to purchase instruments and real teaching aids, textbooks should not only not reduce illustrations but should also increase them. Perhaps this is what their trade association has discussed and decided to do. They certainly have their own grievances. However, I still hope that they can pay attention to the efficiency of education.

I hope everyone will pay serious attention to this matter. In any case, elementary school textbooks cannot be made like this, but simply downsizing them would be fine. Moreover, I also hope that they will not be priced higher!

### Clear Skies After Rain

— Bao Tianxiao

Chapter 24: Lake and Mountain Purged, Each with its Merit; Scholars and Ladies Rejoice, Shouting "Long Live!"

Wei Ai-ren thought: This matter must be discussed with Jin Danyu; I need her help. It would be best if, on Double Tenth Day (October 10th), we could have the same group of people come to Freedom Village and have a lively celebration. She came up with an idea: Mrs. Su Liya donated so much money to the Freedom Village Library. On that day, we should invite her to unveil it. Jin Danyu should be told about this beforehand, otherwise, Mrs. Su Liya will be very busy with banquets on National Day. A trip to the countryside will allow her to decline various banquets. Secondly, the location for the two He sisters' factory has been decided, and the construction of the building is urgent. The design is already with engineer Lin Jiancheng. We should ask Danyu's brother-in-law to urge him to complete the factory design within a few days. We should also discuss with the He sisters about holding a groundbreaking ceremony at the factory site in Freedom Village on Double Tenth Day. Wouldn't that be great? On the day of the groundbreaking ceremony, we can invite many sisters to come, and I will also invite old Dr. ____ to Freedom Village. Zhu Ai-ren's plan was solely to please her grandfather. After discussing it with Jin Danyu, Jin Danyu readily agreed, saying that the construction design was no problem, and she could supervise him. Moreover, there is already a construction company available, and because materials are readily available, construction will be fast. However, she doesn't know if Mrs. Su Liya has any prior engagements that day. If she has no other appointments, she can accompany her. As for herself, she is always extremely busy on National Day because she has to entertain foreign guests. This year, she happens to be on vacation, so she can definitely come. Zhu Ai-ren thought: If Engineer Lin comes, and Mrs. Su Liya comes, you won't dare not come. With that settled, on Double Tenth Day, many sisters will be able to come. That day, after having dinner in Freedom Village, they sent Zhu Ai-ren back to Anlezhen Hospital. Then, the family vehicle returned to Shanghai, arriving at around eleven o'clock at night. The two He sisters had various preparations to make for opening the silk weaving factory. They needed to contact Jiang Jingrong regarding economic and equipment matters, and Lin Jiancheng regarding design and construction matters. Therefore, they also had at least a two-week delay in Shanghai. They weren't lonely in Shanghai, there were many sisters, and Jin Danyu and the others were also planning a second car test drive. This second test drive was originally planned for Saturday, and they also wanted to invite Wu Junsu to go together. Unexpectedly, the weather was bad, and it started to rain. This rain started in the middle of the night when they returned from Freedom Village and continued until Saturday without stopping. (285)

### The Theatrical Tide in the Provisional Capital (Part 1)

— Bi Ying

The Chongqing Drama Festival

(Chongqing Correspondence) This year, April in Chongqing is not only the month of women (because the three Madams, two Queens, and eight female Senators (the entire group), and anti-aggression writer Agnes Smedley, etc., came to Chongqing in April), but also because the theatrical tide on the Chongqing stage is surging, it can also be said to be the month of drama. Four "major productions" were staged in Chongqing in April, which aroused enthusiastic responses from the broad audience. It is even more noteworthy that two of the scripts were made into grand gifts to entertain distinguished guests who came to Chongqing, thus enriching the content of the so-called "theatre month" and making them more active and more meaningful.

The National Academy of Drama's touring performance in Chongqing was the driving force behind this theatrical tide. They brought a total of three "major productions," adding a lot of luster to the provisional capital in April, which is also worth mentioning.

Now, I will report on these four scripts one by one in the order of their performance to the drama fans in the isolated island:

### The First Sound of "Yue Fei"

The first sound of the National Academy of Drama's performance on the Chongqing stage was the historical drama "Yue Fei" in ancient costume. This is a four-act play, written by Gu Yiqiao and directed by Yang Cunbin. It was performed at the Guotai Grand Theatre from April 1st to April 5th in the morning, a total of nine performances.

Generally speaking, the performance of "Yue Fei" cannot be overpraised for its success, but it is not considered a failure either. In terms of the content of the script, it is not active enough and is slightly detached from reality, which is undeniable, but in the epilogue, the writer emphasized it, and the whole play was relatively free of loopholes. In terms of the performers, all the actors were quite dedicated, and their skills were also good. "Yue Fei" is a major production, and if efforts are not made in this area, the performance of "Yue Fei" is extremely dangerous. However, the fact shows that the audience after watching the performance was very satisfied with it, and every show was packed for four days.

At this time, the ambassadors of the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union happened to be gathered in the provisional capital, which was a rare opportunity. Therefore, the National Diplomacy Association assumed its mission of promoting friendly relations and used the ancient costume "Yue Fei" to reserve all the seats for the last performance on the morning of April 5th, completing the two major tasks of entertaining the four ambassadors and promoting the national spirit. At that time, the four ambassadors and their wives and foreign guests in Chongqing all happily attended. Even important figures in the National Government, such as Sun Ke, Feng Yuxiang, Shao Lizi, and Kong Xiangxi, also participated, and the number of people exceeded the original plan. Many ladies of the VIPs even stood and watched the entire performance. On this day, the cameras were even more active, leaving many precious shots for permanent memory.

Finally, everyone happily returned in the majestic sound of "Man Jiang Hong."

— Qiushui

The "International Charity Performance" hosted by the wives of the British and French ambassadors was held at the Lafayette Theatre at 9 p.m. on the 22nd. That night, Lafayette was full of the national flags of China, Britain, and France, and the atmosphere was very solemn. Small-sized Chinese paintings and explanatory notes in English and French were also displayed in the corridor and sold for five or ten yuan as donations. Young ladies of three nationalities carried donation bags made of the French national emblem and peddled paintings and explanatory notes to the noble guests wearing evening dresses.

The award ceremony was held after the first act. First, Police Superintendent Hibbard gave a speech, announcing that Xia Xia, Lan Lan, Bo Li, Xu Li, and Chi Ning were awarded drama medals. Amidst warm applause, the five artists smiled and accepted the medals before returning backstage.

Before the second act, four Chinese paintings donated by Wang Yachen were auctioned for charity. The auction format caused the paintings to gradually increase in value through competition. The first painting was auctioned off for 150 yuan, the second for 190 yuan, the third for 300 yuan, and the fourth for 210 yuan. Before the fourth painting, six flower baskets presented by the Sino-French Friendship Association to the actresses of "Wu Zetian" were displayed in front of the curtain.

A grand event rarely encountered in the theater world passed in a pleasant atmosphere.

### "The Three Smiles" Compete Head-to-Head

— Xing

In recent years, domestically produced films have been popular in ancient costumes, and they all use novels and unofficial histories as the subject matter for screenwriting. Therefore, various companies often unintentionally take the same story. However, there has never been a precedent for actually starting filming at the same time and causing a double-packaging case. This time, Yi Hua and Guo Hua's "The Three Smiles" may break the precedent.

Yi Hua's "The Three Smiles" has already started filming, directed by Yue ____, starring Li Lihua, Yan Hua, Han Langen, Yin Xiucen, etc. Guo Hua has decided to start soon, starring Zhou Xuan, Xu Feng, and You Guangzhao. Liu Zhonghao, the owner of Guo Hua, said: Our company had already planned to film this movie, and if the two companies have to compete head-to-head, then there is no other way.
