### Britain, U.S., and Soviet Union Continue to Aid China; China Determined to Fight to the End; Americans Do Not Believe Peace Negotiations Have Been Initiated; No Peace Believable Unless Japan Withdraws Troops First

Washington: President Roosevelt criticized the current situation last night, saying that the world is facing many difficulties, with the Far East being one of them, and that he is constantly concerned about these issues. Sudden rumors from Shanghai and Tokyo, and unconfirmed reports, have aroused great interest here. However, the idea that peace negotiations are underway is not widely believed. News from Tokyo says that influential Chinese figures, unrelated to Chongqing or Nanjing, are now in contact with Japan, aiming for peace. However, it is questionable who, besides Chongqing, could be an influential Chinese figure capable of negotiating and implementing a peace agreement. According to sources here, if Japan can reach a temporary agreement with the Soviet Union to safeguard Manchuria from border friction and end the fruitless three-year war against China, it can then freely advance its imperialist ambitions elsewhere. The possibility of returning to China after a successful southward expansion is likely the main intention behind the peace feelers emanating from Tokyo. Similarly, the rumor from Tokyo that the Soviet Union has now ceased aid to China is not easily believed. According to reliable sources, Soviet officials have assured U.S. officials that Soviet aid to China will continue unabated. With Soviet assistance continuing, the reopening of the Burma Road, and increased supplies from the U.S., China will be able to continue its struggle. This is evident from the fact that Chinese troops have recently launched offensives on many fronts. Sources here believe that Japan is deeply mired in China and that extricating itself from this quagmire to penetrate Vietnam or advance south to the Dutch East Indies will be extremely difficult.

China in the Pacific

As the First Line of Defense

New York: Tu Yu, Vice Chairman of the American Bureau for Medical Aid to China, stated last night that China is indeed the first line of defense for Americans in the Pacific, both in the past and in the future. He noted that many countries have fallen in the past three years, but China has continued to resist, not weakening but growing stronger. (United Press dispatch, 26th)

Tokyo: "Chugai Business Daily" reported today that Japan is willing to accept a sincere peace proposal from Chongqing if there is no intervention from third countries. The newspaper stated that the condition for accepting such a proposal is China's willingness to genuinely cooperate in building a Greater East Asia. The newspaper added, "The terms of peace should be open and straightforward, without any intervention from third countries. This peace should be resolved through direct negotiations between Chongqing and Japan." "Miyako Shimbun," in discussing the recall of Envoy Kobayashi from the Dutch East Indies, expressed disappointment, saying, "We had hoped to welcome Kobayashi back from the Dutch East Indies as a triumphant general, but we are disappointed to hear of his recall during negotiations." (United Press dispatch, 26th)

Reports from London Say

Trautmann Plans to Return to China

London: There is a possibility that former German Ambassador to China, Trautmann, may return to Chongqing. If so, this is further evidence of the previous suggestion that Hitler's diplomatic offensive includes the Far East. Japan twice used Trautmann, known for his pro-China stance, as an intermediary to propose peace to Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek after the fall of Shanghai and Nanjing. Therefore, Trautmann's return to China is a very meaningful move. Both Hitler and Japan now want to end the Sino-Japanese War. Germany wants its Far Eastern collaborators to have more freedom of action to facilitate the advancement of more intense Axis plans, so it wants to see an early end to the Sino-Japanese War. Japan, having fought for more than three years at a great cost and with the attempt to overthrow Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek ultimately failing, also wants to end the war. According to credible, non-groundless news from Beijing, the Japanese are now secretly using sweet words to induce Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek to accept peace terms. The Beijing correspondent of the Shanghai North-China Daily News recently stated that Japan occupied Vietnam effortlessly, greatly increasing the prestige of the Japanese Navy. The Japanese Navy advocates that Japan's position in the world lies in the South Seas, and this policy is now considered relatively sound by many leaders in political circles. This shows that Trautmann's mission has great significance. As to whether Trautmann can make his previously failed efforts successful, it is at least questionable. Chinese Ambassador to Britain Guo Taiqi had a lengthy discussion with British Foreign Secretary Halifax and Indian Affairs Minister Amery, discussing matters of common interest to China, India, and Burma. The nature of the discussion has not been disclosed, but Ambassador Guo has stated in an interview with Reuters that China's response to Japanese peace feelers is resolute. Ambassador Guo, in recalling Japanese peace feelers last summer, said that the only condition under which China can negotiate peace is the complete withdrawal of Japanese troops from China. China has never agreed in the past three years to accept a compromise that would allow Japan to take a breather before attacking China again. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)

### Japanese Planes Again Attack Chongqing Yesterday; Many Areas in the City Hit and Damaged; One Japanese Plane Shot Down the Day Before

Chongqing: Two waves of Japanese planes, totaling thirty-three, with twenty-four entering Chongqing's airspace on the afternoon of the 26th to drop bombs, while the other nine flew to a certain area and then headed east without dropping bombs. The bombed area in the city was slightly larger than yesterday's, and the damage was slightly heavier. More than twenty civilians were killed or injured, and more than 160 houses were destroyed, mostly shacks inhabited by the poor and ordinary shops. The Catholic Church of St. Joseph and the Christian Women's Young Men's Christian Association were both hit and almost completely destroyed. The former consulate in Chongqing was also hit and had a corner destroyed. Other damaged buildings included customs offices, restaurants, bookstores, post offices, stationery stores, grocery stores, newspapers, and dormitories. (Dispatch, 26th)

Chongqing: Yesterday, twenty-seven Japanese heavy bombers and eighteen light bombers took advantage of the clear weather to bomb Chongqing again. This was the first time in several weeks. The Japanese planes dropped many powerful explosive bombs and incendiary bombs in the city and suburbs, causing fires in many places. Officials say that no military targets were hit. Chinese anti-aircraft fire was exceptionally intense, and it was reported that one Japanese heavy bomber was shot down. (Haitong dispatch, 26th)

Chongqing: This afternoon, Japanese planes bombed Chongqing in various areas of the city and on the northern bank of the Jialing River. Several streets near the Ximen, below the Consulate Lane, were also bombed. Some areas in the lower city that were destroyed by fire during the air raid on September 20 also had many bombs dropped. Many bombs also fell along the road leading to the western suburbs along the Yangtze River. The all-clear signal was issued at 1:00 PM. Today, there were three waves of Japanese attacks on Sichuan, one bombing Chongqing and the other two bombing Chengdu. The alarm here was issued at 10:15 AM when the Japanese planes were spotted entering Sichuan. However, since the first two waves of Japanese planes flew directly to Chengdu, no emergency alarm was issued. It was not until 11:45 AM, when the third wave of twenty-five Japanese planes was spotted flying along the Yangtze River towards Chongqing, that the emergency alarm was issued. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)

### Significant Losses to Church Property

Chongqing: According to investigations by the authorities, of the church properties in the wartime capital that suffered from Japanese bombing, only one church is still safe. The rest have either been destroyed or damaged by the shockwaves, with none remaining intact. The losses suffered by the Catholic Church totaled five million yuan. The losses of the Christian Church are far greater. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)

Editorial

### Peace Offensive and Expanded War

In the past three to five days, there have been two new trends in international affairs: one is the Axis diplomatic offensive led by Hitler, including Germany's coercion of France and Spain, and Japan's efforts to win over the Soviet Union; the other is the so-called peace offensive reported in the newspapers of the last two days, including Marshal Pétain's initiation of peace talks with Britain and Trautmann's mediation of the Sino-Japanese War. On the surface, these two trends are contradictory, because Germany and Italy's urging of France and Spain to join the Axis, and Japan's attempts to reconcile with the Soviet Union, are aimed at strengthening their respective positions, so that they can use further actions to attack their respective opponents, or to deal with common obstacles—the United States. The so-called peace offensive, on the other hand, hopes to end the war, which is the opposite. But in reality, this peace offensive is just like the past few times, either trying to weaken the enemy's fighting spirit through psychological warfare, or trying to wash away the blame for its aggression, so as to further spur its people.

As far as China is concerned, after three years of independent resistance, it has been unyielding. Now that Britain and the United States are stepping up their aid and the international situation is improving significantly, it is hard to imagine that it would easily make peace. So unless, as Ambassador Guo Taiqi said, the Japanese troops in China completely withdraw, any mediation or cooperation, whether by Trautmann or Hitler himself, will be in vain.

As for Britain, with Germany's blitzkrieg against Britain failing to achieve its goals, it is even less likely that it would be willing to sit idly by and watch Germany and Italy dominate Europe, erode Africa, or even give them the opportunity to digest and prepare to fight again.

In summary, there seems to be only one possible explanation for the above two seemingly contradictory pieces of news: that is, assuming that the so-called peace offensive is just a smokescreen for the diplomatic offensive—whether it is used to cover up the progress of the diplomatic offensive or to cover up its failure is another question—and the true meaning of the diplomatic offensive is undoubtedly a preliminary step in expanding the war. As for whether the diplomatic offensive will succeed and whether the expansion of the war will be beneficial to them, it involves very complex issues, which will be analyzed separately below.

First, in terms of the European war, Hitler has been traveling tirelessly in recent days, not hesitating to condescend to visit Pétain and Franco. Although the true details of the two talks are unknown to the outside world, according to reports from all sides, he seems to have already taken the position of a dominating master, "being generous at the expense of others," using French territories as "gifts" for his friends. It is said that he is preparing to give French Morocco to Spain to persuade Spain to declare war on Britain in order to seize Gibraltar; to give Nice and Tunisia to Italy to encourage Mussolini to intensify his attack on Egypt; and even to offer the Asian part of Turkey (?) to the Soviet Union as a reward for Moscow not interfering with the Axis's attack on the Near East and the Suez Canal; and to send Vietnam to Japan to encourage the Tokyo government to bet its last remaining capital on a rash southward advance, thereby containing Britain and the United States. If what is being reported is true, then it is a very grand gesture; to put it bluntly, this may be a new plan by Hitler to change his strategy after realizing that it is not easy to attack the British mainland, to expand the war to both ends of the Mediterranean in order to strike at the British Empire. But because the plan is too big and involves too many problems, it is not easy to achieve; first, it depends on whether the countries being partitioned are willing to submit and be slaughtered, and never cause a revolt; second, it depends on whether the countries receiving the "gifts" think it is worth it to take the bait. As for the former, even if the Vichy government has to sign a land concession agreement under pressure, will the soldiers and civilians in the ceded colonies surrender? Will the powers with interests around the colonies turn a blind eye? Who can be sure of these questions? As for the latter, is Spain willing to test its strength against the British fleet in the Strait of Gibraltar today, when the scars of the civil war have not yet fully healed? Other things, such as Turkey's unwillingness to be slaughtered by others and the Soviet Union's unwillingness to see Germany and Italy control the Dardanelles Strait, are all unpredictable and not optimistic for Germany and Italy.

The above is in terms of the European situation. As for the Far East, the problem can be said to be relatively simple. Japan has obviously changed its strategy and decided to adopt the "southward advance and northward defense policy." Therefore, winning over the Soviet Union has become Japan's latest "national policy," and the Konoe cabinet will of course devote all its efforts to this urgent task with the help of Germany. Regarding this matter, in recent days, people in general seem to have some doubts about the attitude of the Soviet Union, especially after the Japanese side widely spread the news that Japanese Ambassador Tatekawa will meet with Stalin, the world or thinks that the Japanese-Soviet rapprochement is about to be realized; in fact, the so-called rapprochement is at most only the signing of a non-aggression pact. It must be known that the Soviet Union has no intention of invading Japan at all. In the past, it has repeatedly proposed to Japan to conclude such a pact, but the Japanese side has always refused and refused to approach the Soviet Union; so even if an agreement is reached in the future, it can be regarded as the Soviet Union reiterating its established policy of not preparing to go to war with Japan, which is completely unrelated to the aid to China. Because the non-aggression is just that the parties do not meet each other with swords and spears, and does not restrict the party that concludes the treaty from aiding his allies, the truth is that Japan only regards the Sino-Japanese War as the so-called "China Incident," and has never declared war from the beginning. To this day, it has never talked about war, so it is not possible to talk about neutrality with the Soviet Union; moreover, the Soviet Union does not necessarily regard the conclusion of non-aggression pacts as unusual. It had such agreements with China before the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, and with Germany before the outbreak of the European War, and with Poland, Finland, Lithuania, Estonia, Latvia, etc., it had also concluded non-aggression pacts one after another. According to this, if Japan and the Soviet Union conclude a pact, it will only achieve that the Soviet Union will not hinder Japan's southward advance; in Japan's war against China, it will not get any advantage at all; as for the Soviet Union, it can continue to maintain close relations with China, and it is even happier to sit and watch Japan throw itself into the South Pacific. Because Japan consumes one more point of power, the Soviet Union will in fact reduce one point of concern; therefore, the possibility of the conclusion of such an agreement between Japan and the Soviet Union has indeed long existed; even if it is signed, it is by no means a change of plan by the Soviet Union. Therefore, if the Far Eastern war situation really expands one day, it is only Japan accelerating its own consumption, and the nature and effect of the expansion actions of Germany and Italy in Europe and Africa should not be mentioned in the same breath. In today's contradictory news of war and peace, at least this point can be asserted.

### Rumor that Hitler Encouraged France to Ask the U.S. to Mediate European Peace; Hull to Give Speech in Response; Vatican Also Working on Peace Movement

Vichy: Marshal Pétain, the Prime Minister of France, returned here today after holding a historic meeting with German leader Hitler. At the same time, political circles predict that the Vichy government will ask President Roosevelt to urge Britain to negotiate peace before the general election on November 5. The French cabinet will hold a meeting tomorrow to hear Marshal Pétain's report on the meeting with Hitler. Observers here, despite contradictory information from abroad, believe that the first harvest of the talks between Hitler and Pétain will be the launch of a major peace offensive, and believe that Vichy will try to ask for President Roosevelt's help. Rumor has it that Marshal Pétain received some kind of message from President Roosevelt on the eve of leaving Vichy to meet with Hitler on Wednesday. Officials have not confirmed or commented on this. (International News Agency dispatch, 26th)

Washington: Authoritative sources here stated today that the Roosevelt government's determination to expand aid to Britain will defeat any peace offensive that the Axis powers are trying to launch at this time. These sources said that the news from Vichy that Hitler wanted to push Roosevelt as the greatest mediator of the European war would be clearly answered in a speech by Secretary of State Hull at the National Press Club tomorrow night. Hull's speech will be broadcast by radio throughout the United States and overseas. He has been revising his speech all day, and he is expected to state that the U.S. government does not see the possibility of compromise between democracy and totalitarianism. Reliable sources indicate that Hull will detail how the Roosevelt government has previously tried to turn swords into plowshares, and how the Axis powers have ignored it. Hull will reiterate that the United States is still willing to mediate to achieve peace whenever both sides show sincere intentions. According to reliable sources here, the United States has warned Vichy that if it shows further signs of succumbing to Germany, it may sacrifice its tenuous diplomatic recognition here. It is believed that Spanish dictator General Franco has also received the same warning, and has even been hinted that if Spain cooperates more closely with the Axis powers, the shipment of wheat and flour to impoverished Spain, which is currently under consideration by the U.S. government, will be cancelled. (International News Agency dispatch, 26th)

Rome: It is reported that Pope Pius XII has begun new efforts today to achieve peace in Europe as soon as possible, or at least to obtain a temporary truce. It is reported that diplomatic envoys are currently frequently exchanging messages between the Vatican and various countries. While the Pope is reportedly making efforts for peace, peace rumors are rampant in Rome today. An unconfirmed message even claims that the war may end within five days. It is reported that the Vatican's peace efforts are concentrated in the capitals of major powers, as well as the capitals of warring countries. The attitudes of the United States and Latin America are attracting special attention. It is believed that the peace movement supported by the Vatican may receive the support of a large number of Catholics in Latin America. It is believed that the peace advocated by the Vatican is now seeking cooperation from the United States and the Pan-American Union. Observers here point out that President Roosevelt's recent remarks can prove that he can accept this peace movement. In his speech, Roosevelt insisted that he would do his best to prevent the outbreak of war during his tenure. When presidential candidate Willkie accused Roosevelt of dragging the U.S. into the war, Roosevelt replied in a national broadcast that he had exhausted all the power of the president to prevent the outbreak of war in Europe and its descent upon the American people. Observers here believe that Roosevelt's words are extremely important, because President Roosevelt will spend the rest of his years working for peace. (International News Agency dispatch, 26th)

U.S. Concerned About European Situation

Denies Warning to France

New York: The "New York Times" Washington correspondent claimed that, according to diplomatic sources, the United States expressed its concern to France about the possibility of being dragged into the war against Britain, and requested the Vichy government to provide reports on recent developments as soon as possible. The U.S. government is currently reserving its attitude pending the receipt of accurate information on recent events in Europe. It is rumored that the U.S. State Department has warned France that if it joins the war against Britain, it cannot hope for U.S. aid again. Officials here have denied that someone has proposed to the White House to issue the above warning, but because the only way for the U.S. to make it effective would be to join the war, it was not adopted. In addition, there were suggestions that President Roosevelt should appeal to General Pétain, but these were also shelved. French Ambassador to the U.S. Henry met with Undersecretary of State Welles to urge the U.S. government to adopt a reserved attitude towards the current contradictory information. According to Henry himself, he has not received any official news. It is heard that officials in Washington have said that not only can the U.S. not obtain information on the Franco-German meeting, but even the Vichy government is the same, because Laval is keeping it secret, not even notifying his own foreign ministry. Henry saw that Welles was eager to obtain accurate information, so he urgently requested information from Vichy. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)

### After Talking with Hitler, Pétain Returns to Vichy; Has Confidence in the Revival of France; Cabinet Met Yesterday Afternoon; Meeting Between Laval and Ciano Not Confirmed

Vichy: After returning to Vichy from the occupied area last night, French leader Pétain delivered a speech at an official reception, declaring that he has great confidence in the revival of France. It is learned that after Pétain finished talking with Hitler, Associate Laval rushed to Paris to continue talks with the German authorities. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 26th)

Vichy: After French leader Pétain held important talks with German leader Hitler last night, he stayed in the occupied city of Tours for one night. The German military authorities treated him with great respect. When he arrived in Tours, German Ambassador to France Abetz and the local German military commander personally welcomed him, and at Pétain's request, accompanied him to a nearby internment camp to comfort the French prisoners. Pétain returned to the free zone this morning, taking a short rest at the Fontevraud Abbey and inspecting the Musée Château d'Écouen (north of Paris) where various art treasures had been moved. He then returned to Vichy. (Havas News Agency dispatch, 25th)

Vichy: The French news agency announced that the French cabinet convened a meeting at 6:00 PM today. Associate Laval returned here from Paris this afternoon. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)

Berlin: The German official news agency carried a Rome dispatch, saying that it is unlikely that Italian Foreign Minister Ciano and Vichy government Associate Laval will meet. The rumor that the two have already met is untrue. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)

Vichy: Unofficial reports last night stated that the French government has agreed to cooperate with Germany to restore peace and establish a new order in Europe. Although no official report has confirmed this, the recent meeting between French Vice-Premier Laval and Italian Foreign Minister Ciano is believed to be related to this rumor. The French Vice-Premier and the Italian Foreign Minister met once yesterday. It is reported that the German leader hopes that France can cooperate with the Axis powers, so Laval has started negotiations with Ciano. At the same time, it is learned that Leader Pétain and Vice-Premier Laval will report this to the cabinet today. As of today, there is no concrete indication whether France has reached an agreement with Germany. However, it is believed that the German leader has made a proposal as a prelude to diplomatic steps. It is also believed that Hitler's second step will be to ask Britain to establish peace with the united continental group. Marshal Pétain met with Leader Hitler on Thursday, but there were no further negotiations and no documents related to the matter were issued. (United Press dispatch, 26th)

### Italian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Do Not Plan to Visit France

Rome - This morning, the official spokesman for the Italian government declared to news reporters that Ciano does not plan to visit France, and Laval has no intention of coming to Rome. External rumors are false, and the speculation that Mussolini plans to reciprocate a visit to France is also untrue. (October 26, Haitong News Agency)

### King George of England Sends Telegram to Pétain

London - The King of England recently sent a telegram to Marshal Pétain, Premier of the Vichy government.

### Tensions Rise Between Thailand and Vietnam; Thailand Decides on Ultimatum to Vietnam; Vietnam's Tariff Autonomy Begins Next January

Bangkok - Last night, Thai-language newspapers here declared that the Thai government has ordered the immediate cessation of travel between Thailand and Vietnam due to the rising tensions between the two countries. Last night, officials announced that the Third Division of the Thai "Police" has been dispatched to the border provinces to ensure security in the event of unexpected incidents. Local newspapers continue to publish reports of unrest in Vietnam and rumors of open rebellion in Vietnam, and they demand that the government use force to ensure that Thailand's territorial demands on France are immediately met. (Hanoi officials last night denied rumors of a mutiny by Vietnamese native troops and the attempted assassination of French Governor-General Decoux by a French official.) The Thai government announced last night that it had protested to the Vietnamese government about the alleged beating of Thais near An Phu by French gendarmes. (October 26, United Press)

Bangkok - Immediately after its weekly regular meeting, the Thai cabinet convened a special meeting, which has attracted the attention of political circles and the general public. According to Thai newspapers, the special cabinet meeting that was revealed last night reportedly decided on Thailand's ultimatum to Vietnam. It is also learned that multiple trains carrying military supplies were heading to the border areas. At the same time, the Bangkok radio station warned against spreading illegal news abroad, violators of which will be subject to a fine of 50,000 Thai baht or three years in prison. (October 26, Haitong News Agency)

Vichy - The government has just issued an order to allow various goods from Algeria to be imported into Vietnam duty-free, as well as a list of Vietnamese goods to be imported into France and French Algeria duty-free. The list can be drafted annually by the Governor-General of Vietnam and submitted to the French Colonial Ministry for approval. Furthermore, duty-free trade between Vietnam and French colonies and French mandated territories in Africa will be handled in the same way. As for the list of foreign goods to be imported into Vietnam duty-free, it can also be drafted by the Governor-General of Vietnam, but only on the condition that the foreign countries grant Vietnam similar preferential treatment in exchange. Apart from these duty-free goods, import duties into Vietnam will be divided into two types: one is the "general tariff" and the other is the "minimum tariff." In addition, certain types of goods are prohibited from being imported into Vietnam, which will be stipulated separately. According to newspaper reports, the main reason for the government's decision is to allow Vietnam to freely adjust its business relations with Japan. (October 25, Havas)

Berlin - Yesterday's Geneva report from the German News Agency stated that the Vichy government has granted tariff autonomy to Vietnam. According to the German official news agency, the Vichy official gazette has already published this matter, stating that the law authorizing Vietnam's tariff autonomy will take effect from January 1, 1941. This plan will benefit Japanese-Vietnamese economic cooperation. (October 26, United Press)

### Denies Issuing an Ultimatum

Washington - The State Department announced last night that China ordered military supplies from the United States in September worth US$1,335,223, including a large number of military aircraft. It is reported that the amount of American aircraft and engines purchased by China in that month reached US$1,117,270. This figure indicates that China is making every effort to build a strong air force with the help of the United States. At the same time, in the same month, large quantities of military supplies previously ordered by China and permanently imported have also been transported into China, worth US$956,231. Among these items, aircraft accounted for US$633,791, and aircraft parts accounted for another US$297,074. (October 26, United Press)

### Reports of Mekong River Bridge Being Destroyed Are Inaccurate

Chongqing - Japanese broadcasts claimed that Japanese aircraft bombed and destroyed the bridge over the Mekong River on the Yunnan-Burma Road on the 25th. According to reliable information from transportation circles, all bridges on the road are in good condition and traffic is normal. The Japanese claims are purely fabricated. (October 26)

Tokyo - According to unconfirmed reports from a certain place in Vietnam, Japanese naval aircraft circled over Pan Zhihua in the upper reaches of the Min River for more than an hour yesterday afternoon, dropping bombs that hit a suspension bridge built over a gorge thousands of feet deep, completely destroying it and halting traffic on the Burma Road. It is said that at around 3:00 PM yesterday, Japanese aircraft appeared over the gorge between Dali and Baoshan near the Vietnamese border, circling for half an hour under anti-aircraft fire. Two bridges over the gorge were bombed by Japanese aircraft, and nearby military camps were also hit at the same time. (October 16)

### Germany Intensifies Aerial Offensive; London Suffers Another Terrible Air Raid; Bombs Dropped in Downtown Area Cause Numerous Casualties; British Aircraft Fight Back with Intense Artillery Fire

London - Yesterday, Hitler's aircraft squadrons launched another major bombing raid on London. As the air raid began, British fighter planes fired all twelve cannons mounted on their aircraft and unleashed the full power of their engines to fight with the German aircraft. After the morning raid, a large force of German aircraft launched another fierce attack in the afternoon, and they continued to wreak havoc into the night. Yesterday's air raid can be described as the second large-scale attack since the loss of 185 German aircraft on September 15. After midnight, there was a brief respite, but this morning several German aircraft broke through London's outer defenses and dropped their bombs. At 1:00 AM, several German aircraft were reportedly spotted over a town in northeastern England, and two German aircraft reportedly strafed a passenger train with machine guns in an eastern coastal area, but the passengers escaped unharmed. This morning, sporadic anti-aircraft fire continued in London, and several buildings were destroyed by eight bombs. According to official announcements, a shop was destroyed by an oil bomb, and German aircraft dropped numerous incendiary bombs, but they all landed in the fields without causing damage. However, fire brigades and rescue teams were extremely busy, indicating that there must have been fires and damage in various parts of London. According to reliable sources, several incendiary bombs fell on a famous square. Last night, two towns in eastern Scotland were attacked by low-flying aircraft. In one of the towns, a German aircraft dropped three bombs, damaging several houses. No residents were killed or injured. The German aircraft then attacked the town's main street. Pedestrians on the street suddenly encountered an air raid, and to avoid injury, some lay on the ground, while others pressed themselves against the walls. In another town, a German aircraft dropped oil bombs from a height of only 500 feet above the ground, destroying many houses and causing at least twelve deaths and injuries. When German aircraft attacked London yesterday afternoon, they were divided into four squadrons: one squadron with 30 aircraft, one squadron with more than 70 aircraft, and two squadrons with 50 aircraft each. Thousands upon thousands of people in the densely populated streets were caught off guard and suffered many casualties. Many streetcars, buses, shops, and houses were hit by bombs, but the results were still not as terrible as the morning raid. This is clearly because the Germans used light fighter-bombers rather than heavy bombers, as it is more appropriate to use aircraft with less payload for quick escapes. Many British fighter planes, including Hurricanes with twelve aircraft cannons, unleashed the full power of their engines to take off and fight the German air raiders. According to aviators, the artillery fire from the aircraft was as fierce as a butcher's knife cutting meat, and those hit suffered severe damage. These aircraft cannons are still undergoing extensive testing, but it is not planned to equip single-engine aircraft with these cannons yet. It is also reported that the Midlands were also severely bombed at dusk, causing many fires. (October 26, United Press)

French Coast as Base

Italian Air Force Assists in Raids on England

Rome - A special correspondent for the Stefani News Agency recently published details of the Italian Air Force's first assistance to Germany in bombing the British Isles, stating that the Italian Air Force, along with the German Air Force, took off from bases in occupied France on the night of the 24th and flew to southeastern England to bomb important industrial facilities and naval bases, dropping many high-explosive bombs. Large fires broke out on land, and due to the northeast wind, the fires intensified. Although the British fired fiercely with anti-aircraft guns and used searchlights, the Italian aircraft safely returned to their original defenses after completing their missions. This first Italian aircraft bombing of England is the beginning of a joint bombing of the British Isles with Germany. (October 26, Haitong News Agency)

Rome - According to the Italian Stefani News Agency, Italian aircraft participated in the attack on England for the first time since the outbreak of the European war. Hours after the "Italian Daily" disclosed that Prime Minister Mussolini had decided to personally organize a special Italian Air Force, news of the first Italian Air Force raid on Britain was released. According to the newspaper, the Italian Air Force will use the English Channel as a base and cooperate with the German Air Force to attack England. Last night, the Stefani News Agency also reported that Italian aircraft dropped many tons of high-explosive bombs on British military targets, causing fires. It is reported that the Italian aircraft all flew back to their new bases on the French coast without encountering damage. The Stefani News Agency stated that the Italian aircraft's bombing of England can be seen as the starting point for the Italian aircraft to intensify the bombing of British cities. It is reported that the new Italian squadron includes bombers and fighters, led by Italian Air Force Commander Fougier, who has been appointed "Commander of the Northern Air Force." Although the newspaper did not explicitly state the number of Italian aircraft concentrated in the English Channel, it said that "the number of aircraft and personnel in the squadron is astonishing." It is believed here that the Italian aircraft's first attack on the British Isles indicates that the cooperative power of Germany and Italy will intensify, or it will be a prelude to a final offensive against Britain before winter. It is generally believed here that this statement indicates that Italian infantry will soon participate in the landing in England, and Italian submarines may also play a more active role in the English Channel, attempting to intensify the Axis countries' blockade of Britain. Reliable sources reported last night that 200 Italian aircraft, including 40 bombers and 60 fighters, participated in the first Italian air raid on England. It is believed that another 200 Italian aircraft have flown to bases on the French coast, preparing to join the air raids. Italian sources said that thousands of trucks have transported Italian equipment to the English Channel coast, indicating that Italy's military strength is quite strong. (October 26, United Press)

Reasons for Italian Aircraft Participating in Raids on England

London - A Reuters Air Force correspondent stated that there are clearly three reasons for Italian aircraft participating in air raids on England: (1) The weather is deteriorating, and Germany needs the assistance of skilled Italian pilots and crew to maintain the scope of the night raids. (2) Germany is currently reorganizing its heavy bomber squadrons to fight in other theaters, so it needs Italian assistance to cover the retreat of German heavy bombers. (3) Italy persuaded Germany to allow it to participate in the bombing of England to retaliate against the British Air Force's attacks on northern Italy. London officials did not comment on the announcements made by Germany or the above three explanations. According to the German communiqué, Italy's attacks on England are limited to the ports on the east coast. (October 26, Reuters)

Artillery Fire Shakes the Strait of Dover

Dover - British aircraft and long-range artillery launched a major offensive yesterday against German naval convoys off the French coast and in the English Channel. After being hit, the French coastal area formed a vast blaze, covering several miles. As British aircraft attacked Boulogne and Cap Gris-Nez, long-range artillery along the coast also heavily attacked the German escort convoy in the Channel. Because British aircraft laid down smoke screens around the German aircraft, the effects of the British long-range artillery could not be clearly seen. As the artillery fire roared in the sea, the houses in Kent shook. Thousands upon thousands of residents stood on the cliffs of Dover, watching the artillery fire from both sides. The war began after dusk, when German long-range artillery heavily attacked a British convoy sailing into the Channel. The British Air Force immediately circled over the skies between Calais and Boulogne to cover the convoy's passage. British aircraft first dropped flares there and then carried out bombing, and British long-range artillery also returned fire on the German artillery. After the British convoy entered the Strait of Dover, British aircraft bombed the German long-range artillery positions with high-explosive bombs, causing great fires that lit up the sky.

Stockholm, Sweden - A "Aftonbladet" correspondent in Berlin claimed that after a night of calm on Thursday, Berlin was raided again by British aircraft last night.

London - British Air Force bombers carried out repeated raids on the famous Blohm + Voss shipyard in Hamburg, Germany, on Thursday night, lasting two and a half hours. According to the Air Ministry Intelligence Department, the shipyard had previously suffered major damage from attacks, and there were many fires. The oil refinery next to a Hamburg shipyard, which produces 400,000 tons of oil per year, was also attacked by British aircraft in batches, dropping many tons of large bombs and thousands of incendiary bombs, repeatedly hitting the target area, causing fires and soaring flames. As the last batch of British aircraft flew away, they saw red and yellow flashes and thick smoke from the bombed area. In addition, the railway junctions and main railway lines were also hit and destroyed by bombs dropped by British aircraft. (October 26, Reuters)

### Italian Army to Launch New Offensive Against Egypt; British Garrison Now Has 260,000 Men; Air Force Raids Italian Bases for Days

Rome - Italian newspapers have confirmed that General Graziani will launch a new attack in the shortest possible time. Italian journalist Gaeta published an article in the "Italian News" stating that the Italian General Staff has now prepared a plan for a new attack and is ready. Gaeta described the situation of the British army's front lines in Egypt, stating that the troops equipped against the Italian army's front line were the British armored division. General Wavell, Commander-in-Chief of the British Middle East Forces, considers this to be the most elite unit in the British army. The division's mission is to fight in the Sahara. Behind the division, along the road to Mersa Matruh, are two well-trained British divisions. In addition, there are at least seven divisions, whose mission is to protect the traffic lines from Mersa Matruh to the Nile Delta. The British have a total of 260,000 troops in Egypt. Gaeta continued to analyze the military situation in Egypt, stating that the British army failed to effectively resist the Italian army's advance, and that the British navy and air force also failed to prevent the Italian army's advance.

### Molotov Receives New Japanese Ambassador; Japan Hopes for Agreement with Soviet Union

Moscow - Molotov, Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars of the Soviet Union and People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, received the new Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Tatekawa, yesterday. (October 26, TASS)

Moscow - According to today's news, the Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Tatekawa, was received by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov. Although this meeting was a formality upon the arrival of the new ambassador, it is widely believed to be a preliminary to Stalin receiving Tatekawa. Tatekawa's activities have attracted much attention from all sides, due to rumors that Japan and the Soviet Union are brewing a non-aggression treaty. Stalin's reception of the new Japanese ambassador will be a very important event, as Stalin has not received a Japanese diplomat since 1929. Diplomatic observers in Tokyo and Moscow have recently predicted that a non-aggression treaty between the two countries could be concluded soon. (October 26, United Press)

Tokyo - The Asahi Shimbun stated today that Stalin's immediate reception of the Japanese ambassador Tatekawa does not guarantee that the Soviet side will give a satisfactory contribution to Japan's approach. Welcome often indicates that one party is playing with the other. Diplomatic relations are important, but the Soviet method is difficult to swallow. Hitler gave the Soviet Union what the Soviet Union wanted, and then turned to the south. Japan can also imitate this, but to complete this bold step, there must be true unity at home. (October 26, Reuters) The Tokyo Asahi Shimbun recently advocated that the Japanese government take courageous action to establish an agreement between Japan and the Soviet Union.

Tokyo - The Kokumin Shimbun declared today that Japan must change its "pro-American" policy and implement "anti-Americanism." The newspaper said that the United States' attitude towards Japan has changed from "anti-Japanese in public opinion" to "challenging Japan in fact." The Kokumin Shimbun stated, "Our patience is often regarded as cowardice. The result of our patience towards the United States has only made us encounter further humiliation. We have repeatedly explained to the United States that the Tripartite Alliance is not only not aimed at the United States, but is actually 'loving of the United States,' but to no avail. The United States not only does not believe our assurances, but also takes hostile actions against the signatory countries of the Rome-Berlin-Tokyo Pact." (October 26, United Press)

### Japanese Large Submarine Sinks in Accident

### Negotiations Between the Soviet Union, Germany, Italy and Romania Regarding the Danube River Shipping Issue; Establishment of a Mixed Danube River Commission; Discussions Begin to Adjust Maritime Public Law

Moscow: Regarding the establishment of a Mixed Danube River Commission, TASS issued the following public announcement: "As a result of recent negotiations between the Soviet and German governments, and with the agreement of the Italian government, it is deemed necessary to abolish the International Danube River Commission and the European Danube River Commission, and to establish instead a Mixed Danube River Commission, including representatives from the Soviet Union, Germany, Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, Slovakia, and Yugoslavia. The task of this Mixed Commission is to adjust shipping issues on the Danube River (from its mouth to the capital of Slovakia), based on the points agreed upon regarding the above issue. Experts from the Soviet Union, Germany, Italy, and Romania have scheduled to begin negotiations in Bucharest on October 28th, in order to adjust the provisional international public law for the Danube River (from its mouth to the capital of Slovakia) coastal area. The Soviet government is now authorizing Soviet People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs Secretary-General Sobolev to participate in these negotiations as the Soviet chairman representative." (October 26, TASS)

Moscow: The Soviet delegation attending the Danube River conference in Bucharest on Sunday departed from Moscow yesterday, flying to Burgas, and then proceeding to Romania. The Soviet delegation is led by Foreign Ministry Secretary-General Sobolev. According to Germany's recent announcement, a new "Axis Commission" will be established to replace the International Danube River Commission established under the Treaty of Versailles, and to adjust Danube River traffic issues. Moscow has expressed the hope that any events affecting the Danube River countries should be discussed with the Soviet Union as well. (October 26, Reuters)

Bucharest: The European Danube River Commission was originally scheduled to meet yesterday, but it did not take place because the Soviet delegation had not yet arrived. It is expected that the Soviet delegation will arrive yesterday, but a meeting will not be held before Monday. (October 26, Haitong)

Sofia: The fact that the Soviet Union has been invited to participate in the Danube River conference in Bucharest suggests, purely from an observer's perspective, that the speculation circulating in diplomatic circles that the Axis powers have abandoned their ambitions in the Near East appears to be confirmed yesterday. Observers believe that the Axis powers dare not ignore the Soviet Union, and therefore granted it a speaking role at the Danube River conference. (October 26, United Press)

### Mexico Bans Oil Exports to Japan

Mexico City: The Mexican government has now publicly declared a policy of not allowing any goods that can be used for military purposes to be exported to the Axis powers. This sentiment has been substantiated by a formal decree. According to this decree, all types of oil will no longer be shipped to Japan, and the concession rights enjoyed by the Veracruz Company, an affiliate of Japan's Mitsubishi Corporation, to exploit oil wells on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico have also been cancelled. As for mercury, scrap iron, antimony, and manganese, exports to Japan have already been banned. It is reported that several Japanese ships bound for Mexico have been ordered to divert to other destinations mid-journey due to the oil export ban, and ships loading oil at Pacific ports have now stopped loading. In the future, any goods that can be converted for military use must be declared that they will not be shipped to Germany, Italy, or Japan before being allowed to be exported. This situation is of great significance, as it indicates that Mexico is now backing the United States' war policy. (October 26, Reuters)

These sources also said that the President is currently paying close attention to the situation in Spain, the French fleet incident, the issues of Greece and the Balkans, and the issues of the Far East.

### East of the Suez Canal: British Empire Representatives Conference; Indian Viceroy Linlithgow Delivers Closing Address

New Delhi: The conference of the group east of the Suez Canal opened here yesterday. Representatives from various parts of the Empire discussed the Empire's war effort, with the aim of enabling their own dominions to produce war materials as much as possible, without relying on the mother country. During the opening ceremony yesterday, Indian Viceroy Lord Linlithgow delivered a speech, stating that most empires in the past collapsed due to certain traditional weaknesses in the interior. The British Empire does not seem destined to repeat this mistake. All of us have a major task before us, and it is gratifying that we are able to unite and operate to pursue a common cause and make a very valuable and perhaps decisive contribution. However, if the results of the highest value are to be promoted through our joint efforts, our contribution must be timely and sufficient, because in war only agility can win victory. All British members of the Empire have a common heritage to defend, and the sister nations united with them also derive their desires from the traditions we uphold. We, to varying degrees, represent a political philosophy that fills the whole, but the common atom of the whole believes in freedom and is convinced of all the elements that create the true greatness of a nation. What we are trying to achieve here is not only to enhance our credibility and not be unworthy of being a unit of the globally broadcasting Empire, but also to reflect our firm belief in the glorious heritage, which is enjoyed by us as members of a group of freedom-loving nations.

European War Anecdotes (23)

### Romania's New Ruler, Michael, and Carol

Michael's father, the deposed King Carol, was originally known in Europe as a famous "troublemaker." He was born in 1893. His father, King Ferdinand, although not a brilliant founder, was still a competent guardian. His mother, Queen Marie, was beautiful and was originally the granddaughter of Queen Victoria, Princess Coburg. Carol was similar to ordinary children in his childhood. According to his mother, everything was very orderly and organized when he was young. He was born with a temperament of self-restraint and handling affairs. Who knew that after the end of the last European war, this Romanian crown prince would stage a moving love affair?

In 1918, Carol suddenly left the capital without a trace. For the first few days, no one knew where he had gone. The palace, government agencies, and diplomatic corps all found it very strange. Later, Carol's flight gradually became known to outsiders. At that time, he was only twenty-five years old. With the status of crown prince, he secretly married Zizi Lambrino, a commoner woman, in Russia. This woman's appearance was okay, but unfortunately, her background was very ordinary and she had no aristocratic air at all. She was the daughter of a Romanian artillery officer. After they fell in love, they eloped together and got married in the city of Odessa.

After the news of Carol's marriage to a commoner woman reached the palace, the King and Queen were very disapproving. They insisted that he break up with Zizi and told him to return to the capital immediately. For the first few months, Carol refused to budge and even attempted suicide twice. He traveled far away, but later the Romanian court declared their marriage invalid in January 1919. Carol was forced to yield under the circumstances. At that time, his commoner wife was about to give birth, and in January of the following year, she gave birth to a boy.

On the one hand, the Romanian court declared Carol's marriage to a commoner woman invalid. On the other hand, the King and Queen chose a Greek princess, Helen, as their son's wife. Carol, in frustration, did not resist and agreed readily. They held a grand wedding in Vienna on March 10, 1921. The time after the wedding was quite sweet because the couple had a good relationship. Moreover, Princess Helen gave birth to Prince Michael on October 25 of that year. The palace was naturally filled with joy. Unfortunately, good things are impermanent, and another storm arose in the sea of love. Soon, Carol met Madame Lupescu. The tragedy of the family relationship started from this. Princess Helen was relegated to the cold palace invisibly.

Madame Lupescu was an overweight operator and had long been a leader in the powder team. She had red hair and a very plump and moving face. Her eyes were like full ginkgo nuts, charming and captivating, making people unable to control themselves at first glance. After Carol was frustrated in love, he was already disheartened. After making a pact with Madame Lupescu, a fire-like passion burned in his heart again. He disregarded everything, abandoned the position of crown prince, and eloped to Paris with his mistress. At this time, his first wife was also living in the city of Neuilly, near Paris in northern France, leading a lonely and desolate life. Carol was tired of the old and only saw the new smile, not hearing the old crying. Such ingratitude was truly heartbreaking. When the old King Ferdinand heard that his son had done this, he was very angry and told his son to choose between the throne and the woman. Carol was really generous. He wrote a reply to his father saying that he formally gave up his qualification as the heir to the throne, as long as he was allowed to remain a Romanian commoner, he would be satisfied and everything could be ignored.

Ferdinand died in July 1927. Carol was in Paris at this time and requested to return to the country for the funeral, but was rejected by the Romanian court. According to the 1926 law of succession, Carol had no hope of ascending the throne, so he supported the six-year-old Michael to the throne and organized a regency system to handle all state affairs during his minority. Carol's wife, Princess Helen, formally filed for divorce in the Romanian court after Ferdinand's death. The case was approved by the court in 1928, granting the divorce. However, Carol remained silent during this period.

Carol led the life of an "exiled prince," which was also carefree and natural. He seemed uninterested in the politics of his homeland and did not ask about it. He only stayed with his lover, Madame Lupescu. Their traces could be found everywhere in Europe's famous mineral springs and resorts. He seemed to be living recklessly, not knowing where his destination was. But suddenly, Carol suddenly changed. This courage to turn around was truly surprising.

In the Western Union Football League, there are seven matches today.

St. Francis is also a leader among Western teams, being the runner-up in the First Division last season. In their first match this season, they defeated the French Business team 3-1. Their forward attack is fierce, with Edwards and Fownes on the wings being the most dangerous players. Therefore, this morning's match is of great importance, and both sides will give their all to win. It is unknown who will emerge victorious.

Chairman's Speech

Today is the first day of our camp's sports meet, which is also the anniversary of our order to cover the retreat and hold the Sihang Warehouse for three weeks. We feel that holding this sports meet in this dark and dangerous environment is particularly solemn and grand. Our country has a glorious history and culture of five thousand years. Since ancient times, the people of our country have been physically strong and spiritually vigorous, with the courage to sacrifice themselves for righteousness. The spirit of pioneering and indomitable creation has benefited world civilization and created brilliant miracles for the benefit of mankind. Countless examples can be cited. At that time, the national fortune was prosperous, China was powerful, and the world respected us. In recent centuries, due to political corruption and the shortcomings of the education system, the physical fitness of the people has declined, the spirit of the people has become listless, and they seek safety and security. As a result, morality has declined, and the national strength has weakened. We have been branded as the "sick man of East Asia," which is truly shameful. Since our party came to power, the founding father of the nation has repeatedly called for the promotion of national physical education, and the leader of our party has promoted and encouraged it. The popularization of national physical education has gradually become a fashion, and the spirit of the people has been greatly revitalized. However, the life of the country depends on the nation, and the health of the nation depends on the strength and vitality of the people. Therefore, in the future, we should build a national physical education system centered on national defense, thoroughly reform the education system, remedy the shortcomings of education that violate social morality, correct the defects, and only pay attention to instilling knowledge, creating lifeless and decadent parasites that harm the country and the nation. We should devote all the manpower and resources of the country to providing Spartan-style national physical education training to young men and women in their childhood to cultivate the virtues of obedience and cooperation, cultivate national consciousness, inspire the spirit of martial arts, strengthen self-confidence and decisiveness, and accurately cultivate outstanding national masters who are polite, righteous, honest, responsible, and disciplined to shoulder the great task of national rejuvenation. I hope that all my compatriots will strive together to achieve this goal.

### Finance: Foreign Exchange Continues to Weaken, but Selling Volume Remains Considerable

The foreign exchange market yesterday saw HSBC's listed prices unchanged. The black market for British and American currencies continued to weaken sharply. The exchange rate for the US dollar in this month has already reached the 6-yuan mark. Given the general trend, it is expected to exceed 6 yuan. News broke today that German Ambassador Dr. Trautmann would arrive in Chongqing, and this trip was related to peace. As a result, speculators dumped US dollars, reaching over 400,000 yuan. Although foreign firms showed some appetite for buying, their positions were too large, and the price hardened. The closing price was stable. As a result, the British pound closed at 3 shillings, 8 pence, 4375, and the US dollar closed at 5.96875 yuan, down 0.013625 and 0.0625, respectively, compared to the previous day. Futures and spot prices were the same.

This Month's Futures to Reach 6 Yuan

The morning began with London's large-denomination notes, with both near-term and long-term rates flat. New York silver prices remained flat, and London's spot gold price was fixed. Exchange rates for British vs. US dollars and Shanghai dollars were all flat. The US dollar was up 25 points against the British pound, up 4 points against the Shanghai dollar, and there was no market for the French franc. The central exchange rate remained the same as before. Banks opened in the morning with spot selling prices of 3 shillings, 8 pence, 28125 for the British pound and 5.90625 yuan for the US dollar, unchanged from the previous day's closing price. After the opening, American banks took the lead in selling, and speculators followed suit, causing the market to harden. It is estimated that a certain American bank sold US dollars for this month at prices ranging from 5.90625 to 5.9375 yuan to foreign firms. Speculators sold US dollars for the following month to foreign firms at 5.9375 yuan. HSBC's listed prices remained unchanged, and there was no increase or decrease in the silver equalization tax. As rumors of a favorable agreement spread, speculators dumped more aggressively, and supply exceeded demand, causing prices to rise sharply. It is estimated that speculators sold current US dollars to a certain American bank and foreign firms at prices ranging from 5.9375 to 5.96875 yuan. Before noon, Chase absorbed favorable US dollars for the same month, causing a slight softening to 5.96875 yuan. The closing results were 3 shillings, 8 pence, 4375 for the British pound and 5.96875 yuan for the US dollar. The futures price for this and the following month was the same as the spot price, with the British pound up 0.015625 and the US dollar down 0.0625 compared to yesterday's closing price.

The New York telegraphic transfer rate strengthened by 0.09375 to 5.75 yuan. The black market rates for the Shanghai dollar and the "Joint Reserve Notes" remained at their original levels.

### Buyers of Gold Vanish

Yesterday's cash gold market saw a sharp decline in the black market, followed by a slight rebound. The result was still a drop. Initially, due to the weakening of foreign exchange and rumors of peace, securities firms and banks sold heavily. However, there were no buyers in the market, and the price plunged to a low of 5,555 yuan. Later, another bank and retail investors took advantage of the low prices to buy in, and the market hovered higher before closing. The closing price was 5,605 yuan, down 65 yuan from the previous day. It is reported that the current delivery price on the same day was re-hedged and opened at around 56-60 yuan, with a small amount of trading. Jewelry stores ultimately listed prices at 10 yuan lower, while customs gold and other items remained flat. There was no market in the afternoon due to Saturday.

Cash Gold Again Cannot Support

The market opened this morning with the exchange rate flat. A gold firm first sold ten taels of exchange business cash at 5,650 yuan, an opening price down 20 yuan from the previous day. Then, securities firms and banks came to dump heavily, lacking support, and the price plunged by 100 yuan. It is estimated that a gold firm sold twenty taels to a bank at 5,550 yuan. Later, as banks and others saw the low price and absorbed slightly, sellers stopped selling at this time, causing the price to rise by 70-80 yuan. A securities firm bought ten taels from a bank at 5,620 yuan. However, exchange businesses and others sold again, unable to support the price, and it fell again. A bank sold twenty taels to a gold firm at 5,585 yuan. The market was still firm at the close, with a bank buying ten taels from a gold firm at 5,605 yuan, the closing price, down 65 yuan compared to the previous day's settlement price.

Jewelry Gold Continues to Fall by 10 Yuan

The exchange price for jewelry gold was reduced by 10 yuan per tael. Datonghang changed its listed price to 580 yuan. New Tonghang's price was similar to the previous price. The purchase price was about 30 yuan lower.

### Japanese Side Spreads Rumors of Seeking Peace, Japanese Currency Falls Quickly

Yesterday's foreign currency market was affected by rumors spread by the Japanese side that they were seeking peace, and it was also rumored that the German ambassador was planning to fly to Chongqing. It was generally believed that this trip might involve mediating the Sino-Japanese war, causing the market price of cash gold to fall. The British and American gold pounds also fell by 2 yuan. The British gold note continued to fall by 1 yuan. The American gold note once retreated to 16.15 yuan, eventually closing at 16.22 yuan, down 0.24 yuan compared to the previous day. The Hong Kong note fell by 0.02 yuan. The Japanese gold note fell sharply, retreating to 1.47 yuan in the evening market, down 0.05 yuan compared to the previous day. The Korean note was slightly in demand, and the price rose by 0.01 yuan compared to the previous day, rising to 1.20 yuan in the evening market.

### Securities and Domestic Debt Fluctuations are Large, as Lively as Before the War

The securities black market saw frequent fluctuations yesterday, with a difference of 1.5 yuan between the high and low prices. The trading volume has gradually expanded recently, which is evident. The number of spot transactions has increased, and interbank lending is extremely rare. The range of market price fluctuations and the amount of transactions in and out of various groups are no less lively than before August 13th, when the market was officially open. The market opened in the morning, and Yuxing's selling continued to pour in. Lianyi and Tongshun also sold. The Type C bond broke through the 9-yuan mark. After a long period of competition, Jiufeng and Tongkang bravely bought in, and the market suddenly smelled of peace. Xinhua, Lianhe, and others also bought a lot. Hengfu first sold and then bought in a large amount. The market price broke out of 9 yuan and then rushed past the 60-cent mark. However, Yuxing had a continuous supply, and the amount was large. Lianyi and Tongshun also sold a lot, but retail investors also absorbed enthusiastically. The market price closed within the 60-cent mark. In the afternoon, Maotai and Hongda bought in Type C bonds and raised the price outside the 60-cent mark. However, Yuxing, Lianyi, Tongshun, Hengfu, and Shengda all sold, and Tongxin and Dingkang bought in. The market price was once reduced to 9.40 yuan. The overall result of the competition was still an improvement of 0.15-0.6 yuan. The total number of transactions reached over 400 yuan. A brief table is listed below:

Stock Transactions: 50 shares of Minyi Pharmaceutical were traded at a price of 20.10 yuan.

London, 25th (Friday) - The listed market prices for Chinese foreign debt and Far East British company stocks were flat today. The market prices showed no gains or losses.

The British Shanghainese Calcutta Oak Company, managed by Huachang Foreign Company, will pay an interim dividend of 60 cents per share in national currency on November 6th for the year ending March 1941.

### Grain: Rice Market Fluctuates Wildly, Falls in the Morning, Rises at Noon, and Becomes Stagnant Again in the Evening

Imported rice entered a fluctuating situation yesterday. The market fell in the morning, soared at noon, and became stagnant and lifeless again in the evening. The spot price of imported rice fell and then rose. The results show that, aside from the lack of transactions in the evening market, the gains and losses were evened out. Selling and not opening the sales during the high rise at noon, the price appeared to be 40-50 cents higher than the night before. In the early morning, the rice market followed the downward trend of the previous day, and the prices of various types of rice fell slightly from several cents to nearly one yuan amidst the lively selling. After the fall, the local shops were more actively buying, and new investors were looking for opportunities. In addition, major traders were unwilling to sell anymore at a loss, and overseas prices rebounded. Foreign firms were promoting the sale of several hundred tons of Saigon No. 1 and No. 2 rice, with No. 1 priced at 76.80 yuan and No. 2 priced at 72 yuan, about one yuan higher than the promotional price of the previous day. The original bags that were returned were also sold at higher prices, with high-quality No. 2 Saigon rice at 74 yuan and general market rice at 73 yuan. The market was quite prosperous, and the spot price of imported rice immediately increased by more than one yuan. However, in the afternoon, some floating traders sought to sell, and buyers were inactive. Siamese No. 2 rice fell slightly by half a yuan. Although other types of rice were not sold, the situation was weakening.

A total of 2,300 to 2,400 piculs of new japonica rice and wild rice arrived, mostly new japonica rice. Therefore, the price of new japonica rice continued to depreciate by more than one yuan, while the price of japonica rice remained unchanged. The price of wild rice even increased by half a yuan. It is estimated that new japonica rice was sold at 72 yuan, down to 70.20 yuan, japonica rice at 75.5 yuan and 75 yuan, and wild rice at 79 yuan. Duyang japonica rice remained firm with no gains or losses, and the original bags were priced at 70 yuan. The sales of glutinous rice remained sluggish, resulting in a situation where the market resembled that of Hebei, with the selling price maintained with difficulty. Although Yili glutinous rice was still priced at 76.5 yuan, the opening price for various types of glutinous rice yesterday was 72-73 yuan.

### Returned Flour Prices Gradually Weaken, Wheat Arrivals and Sales are Both Sluggish

Flour: Yesterday's flour market transactions were quite dull. As customer sales continued to weaken, the number of exclusive sales licenses issued by various factories to local street vendors increased. The local demand gradually became sufficient, so the prices of returned goods sought by sellers lacked buyers. It is reported that the price for old car stocks has fallen to 18.8 yuan, but no formal agreement has been reached. Affected by the environment, the price of foreign flour's Double Eagle brand has weakened from 19.2 yuan to 19.1 yuan. Ordinary Triangle brand foreign flour is only 18.6-18.7 yuan, with 300-500 bags purchased by local street vendors. The price of Chinese flour from the factory remained at 17 yuan, with about 10,000 bags sold.

Wheat: Yesterday's wheat market was weak, with both arrivals and sales sluggish. Due to the limited production of Japanese and Chinese factories, the raw material demand was not high, and the purchase price was still limited to the original price. Except for a few occasional deliveries to Japanese factories nearby, there were no formal transactions.

### Oilseed Cake: Oil Market is Entirely Futures Trading

Yesterday's oil market was entirely focused on futures trading. The day was full of twists and turns, and as a result of speculative manipulation, the price rose by one yuan. The spot oil market at the beginning of the morning was unable to verify yesterday's rumors of foreign traders taking action. Only the push to promote sales to Western restaurants caused the firm and expensive sentiment to collapse. With a steady stream of supplies, the speculators' barriers were difficult to resist. It is estimated that 50 pieces of Jiaozhou raw oil were traded at a price of 70 yuan, 100 pieces for delivery in the lower half of November at a price of 71 yuan, 30 pieces of Yantai raw oil at a price of 69.5 yuan, 200 barrels of Qingdao raw oil for delivery in the upper half of November at a price of 98.5-100 yuan, 900 barrels for delivery in the lower half of November at a price of 99.5-101.25 yuan, 400 barrels for delivery in the lower half of December at 202-202.25 yuan. Soybean oil was flat, with only 50 pieces of Jiaozhou oil and 50 pieces of Yantai oil sold.

On the 26th, 2,380 tins of raw oil and 500 pieces of soybean oil arrived from Qingdao.

### Yarn and Cotton: Yarn Market Could Have Been Flat, but Bulls' Hopes Were Not Dead

The trend in the yarn market showed signs of flattening and weakening, mainly due to the relative sluggishness in the sales of spot goods. At the same time, the daily increase of the foreign exchange rate was a slight blow to speculation, and some investors became slightly less enthusiastic. However, the major players still leaned towards the buying side, so the market remained firm and expensive. A certain bank sold hundreds of bales, and a core member of a certain long position source still absorbed them, indicating the fierce struggle between the two sides. However, the base has already entered a high level.

The spot yarn market opened in the morning with a slightly flat atmosphere, as there was little hope for a large-scale development in the spot yarn sales market for the time being. In addition, the market price on a certain exchange did not increase, and new buyers were relatively lacking. The opening price for 20-count Double Horse yarn was 1,270 yuan, down 9 yuan. Unexpectedly, as soon as the price fell, buying enthusiasm rose again, and scalpers became active again, pushing the price up to between 1,277 and 1,272-3 yuan, where it fluctuated for a long time. Then, rumors suddenly spread that a peaceful resolution was imminent, and sellers suddenly became enthusiastic, causing the market to gradually decline, falling directly to 1,255 yuan. However, those who had profited took the opportunity to cover their positions, gradually rising to 1,264 yuan. According to the half-day transaction statistics, 5,565 bales were traded, and the market price fell by 17.5 yuan. The amounts purchased by various groups are listed on the left:

Hong Kong 565, Peer 5,000, Total 5,565

45 pieces of cotton yarn will be transported to Yantai on the 27th.

### Foreign Cotton Remains Firm and Expensive, Local Cotton Sources Decline

Spot cotton transactions showed signs of significant stagnation. The factories' purchases were flat, but those who held the goods were unwilling to compromise on the market price due to the declining sources, so the situation became a standoff again.

According to another report, the market price of foreign cotton was quiet in the New York cotton market. First, there was a lack of major buyers in the market, and then, due to Southern hedging and the settlement of some long positions, the closing price fell by three to four pounds sterling compared to the previous day. The Indian cotton market rose by more than one rupee yesterday, including the forecast.

The transaction of foreign cotton in Shanghai has continued to be unusually active recently. However, because there have been no arrivals recently, and the factories' inventory is not abundant and demand is increasing, the spot price has remained high. According to this situation, the price of cotton will continue to rise.

### Piece Goods Market is Stable, Fine Cloth and Fine Twill are in High Demand

Domestic Cloth: The trend was stable yesterday. The industry's intention to hoard has loosened slightly, while the purchases by the Cantonese group continued to be strong. The Zhejiang-Fujian group's purchases gradually increased, and the factories sold at gradually increasing prices. Floating traders had ( ) to sell, but there were few bulk purchases. The market price of various goods was flat. A small portion of hand-held goods was cheap, with each piece priced at 2.5 cents. Fine twill was the most popular in current sales, and the price was also firmer. Over 500 pieces were traded on the street. The Cantonese and Hong Kong groups purchased over 300 pieces of colored cloth, colored twill, and government cloth. The Zhejiang-Fujian groups purchased over 100 pieces of bleached cloth, bleached twill, and colored cloth. Four pieces of piece goods will be transported to Yantai today.

Eastern Cloth: The demand for dyed grey fine cloth and fine twill on the street continued to be strong. The price rose by 5-7.5 cents per piece yesterday. High-end Dragon Head fine cloth hovered around 38 yuan. The closing price was 38.15 yuan, up slightly by 5 cents. Four Gentlemen Serge was sold for 1.17 yuan per yard, up only 2 cents.

### Sugar Market: Raw and White Sugar Prices Show Mixed Trends

Yesterday's sugar market association price was 73 yuan for existing coarse white, exterior warehouses were at 73 yuan, with a small price of 5 cents. Tate & Lyle vehicle white B mark, Western warehouse at 72.5 yuan, Eastern warehouse at 72 yuan. DY mark, Western warehouse at 68.4 yuan, HX mark, Eastern warehouse at 67.8 yuan. Spot price of raw Dutch sugar at 56 yuan, a price increase estimated at 5 cents. Goods en route with a dated receipt from November 18th sold for 56.2 yuan.

### Coal: Coal Ball Black Market Eliminated

After various criticisms of coal ball prices, the black market among merchants has gradually disappeared. The Yi Tai Xing Coal Ball Factory is supplying both new and old customers as much as possible, and people are settling down. The price among merchants is still 132 yuan per cart, and the retail price at stores is 7 yuan and 20 cents per picul. However, a certain large factory is requiring old consignment shops to clear out their stock by the end of the month, or they will repurchase the goods at the original selling price. The intention is unclear and highly suspicious.

### Metals: Copper Shortage, Spot Goods Expected Soon

Previously, due to aggressive purchases by foreign firms, there was a shortage of spot American copper on the market. This made merchants think highly of the copper, and prices soared, reaching 370 yuan per picul, an increase of more than ten yuan compared to before. It has been learned that 100 tons of spot goods are expected to arrive in port in the next few days, but they have already been purchased by several copper and tin firms.

### Medicine: Betel Nuts Slightly Decrease

Recently, not many betel nuts have arrived, but demand from all sides is also low. Therefore, the market is trending downward. High-quality large white betel nuts are now 64 yuan, a decrease of two or three yuan compared to before. However, betel nut shells have become more valuable, rising from 35 yuan to 40 yuan.

### Financial Commentary

— Saint-Kei Qiong

——October 26th——

New Changes in the Consolidated Tax

Wartime finance, in short, is about raising war funds. The methods of raising funds are nothing more than (1) increasing taxes or implementing new taxes; (2) issuing domestic and foreign debt; (3) increasing paper money will quickly cause malignant inflation, which is very harmful to the national economy, so it is never risked unless absolutely necessary. Therefore, wartime finance methods cannot escape the two important avenues of taxes and public debt, while raising donations is only a very minor method in wartime finance. However, taxes and public debt differ in the speed at which they take effect on wartime finance, so these two must be coordinated and used comprehensively. To make the use of these two proceed smoothly, increasing the circulation of some paper money is also unavoidable.

Chinese wartime finance, in order to adapt to the military environment, people's psychology, national wealth, and social and economic conditions, takes into consideration increasing taxes, issuing public debt, increasing paper money, and raising donations. However, in order to meet the current needs of resisting aggression and building the nation on the one hand, and to take into account the prosperity of the national economy after the war on the other, greater emphasis is placed on increasing taxes and issuing public debt. Especially under various difficulties, efforts are still being made to apply tax policies. For example, after three years of resistance, the tax policy has shifted from relying on indirect taxes to direct taxes, with income tax, inheritance tax, special excess profits tax, and stamp tax as the focus. As for indirect taxes such as tobacco and alcohol tax and transit tax, the tax rates have been appropriately increased, and the scope of the consolidated tax is planned to be expanded and is being prepared. On October 22nd, the Executive Yuan already passed the "Provisional Regulations on Sugar Consolidated Tax" consisting of ten articles!

The increase in the consolidated tax among indirect taxes has been implemented since October 17th. The current consolidated tax rates are: (1) Cotton yarn consolidated tax: Grade A, not exceeding 17 counts, 10 yuan per metric ton; Grade B, exceeding 17 counts to 23 counts, 12 yuan; Grade C, exceeding 23 counts to 35 counts, 15 yuan; Grade D, exceeding 35 counts, 20 yuan. (2) Match consolidated tax: Sulfur-phosphorus matches, 24 yuan per box for Grade A, 30 yuan for Grade B; Safety matches, 30 yuan per box for Grade A, 39 yuan for Grade B, 48 yuan for Grade C. (3) Cement consolidated tax: 3 yuan per box of 170 kilograms. (4) Cured tobacco leaf consolidated tax (same as tobacco leaf tax): divided into three grades, Grade A taxed at 16 yuan per 100 catties based on a wholesale price of more than 40 yuan at the place of production, Grade B taxed at 8 yuan for more than 20 yuan but less than 40 yuan, and Grade C taxed at 4 yuan for less than 20 yuan.

As for the sugar consolidated tax recently passed by the Executive Yuan, let us analyze it: (1) The types of taxes include seven types: brown sugar, white sugar, crystal sugar, rock sugar, cube sugar, saccharin, and other types of sugar. (2) The tax rate is 15% for domestically produced sugar based on the wholesale price of nearby markets at the place of production, and 15% for imported sugar in addition to customs duties after converting the customs valuation into legal tender. (3) The method of taxation: For domestically produced sugar, the wholesale price of nearby markets at the place of production should be investigated every four months by the sugar tax authority and submitted to the Tax Affairs Administration for approval of the tax-inclusive price and the amount of tax payable for each type of sugar. For sugar packed inside, the consolidated tax bureau or tax bureau of each province should send personnel to collect taxes at the factory; in special circumstances, the Tax Affairs Administration may directly send personnel to collect taxes; if the output is small, the circumstances may be taken into account, and one resident factory staff member may be assigned to several nearby factories, but if it is inconvenient to collect taxes at the factory in reality, the merchant should report to the first-level sugar tax authority and collect taxes in accordance with the regulations.

The Chinese government established the consolidated tax to compensate for the loss of the national treasury after the abolition of likin. Therefore, based on the opinion of the Kemmerer Commission, the consolidated tax was levied on domestic industrial products manufactured on a large scale using machinery and consumed in large quantities by the people. However, at that time, China had already established consolidated taxes on cigarettes and wheat flour special tax in the seventeenth year. Therefore, following the established rules of cigarettes, consolidated taxes on cotton yarn, matches, and cement were established in January of the twentieth year, and the wheat flour special tax was also merged for management. Subsequently, due to the excellent results of the consolidated tax revenue, cured tobacco, beer, liquor, soda, etc. were added, and the tax rates on cigarettes, cotton, etc. were also improved and increased. Since the various taxes have not been increased and the scope of taxation has not been expanded after the war, this increase and modification of various tax rates and the new sugar consolidated tax are the first major changes to the consolidated tax in the three years of the War of Resistance.

The consolidated tax has always been known as the vigorous tax revenue along with customs and salt taxes, and the total of customs and salt taxes accounts for more than 80% of China's annual revenue. After the war, most of the consolidated tax industries were affected by the war, either suspended business or moved inland to resume business. Those that did not move inland in the occupied areas have been forcibly occupied, and the consolidated tax can no longer be collected by the Chinese government. According to statistics in the twenty-seventh year, the consolidated tax revenue was still around 50 million yuan, which is one of the important sources of financial resources for the War of Resistance. In short:

From the above, let us recall the methods adopted by China's wartime finance in the past three years. Although it has not exceeded the four methods that the author started with, the fact that China's wartime finance relies particularly on the application of tax policies is an undeniable fact. Therefore, the Chinese people should not think that China's wartime financial foundation is built on public debt and paper money just because a little public debt and some legal tender have been issued. On the contrary, in order to "win the War of Resistance and build the nation," the foundation of China's wartime finance is indeed based on the development of abundant resources and the most reliable tax policy, while legal tender and public debt are just means to achieve the development of resources and the cultivation of tax sources, and are not the final way out for China's wartime finance!

### More Than 2,000 American Nationals in Shanghai to be Fully Evacuated This Year, Mondale Ship Price Reduction Approved, First Group of Americans Depart on the 3rd of Next Month

A group of forty American nationals residing in the Chinese interior have successively arrived in Shanghai to await repatriation by ship, having been ordered to withdraw back to their home country. Additionally, some American women and children have transferred from Dalian to Shanghai and arrived here yesterday. More than one hundred and fifty dependents of the U.S. Navy in Shanghai and Mr. Macleish will depart Shanghai on the Mondale ship and the Dollar Steamship Company's Coolidge, Pierce, Taft and President ships next month.

American Steamship Fares to be Reduced The English-language North China Daily Mail reports that the United States has dispatched three postal ships racing to Shanghai to assist in the evacuation of American nationals from the Far East. The fares on one of these ships, the Mondale, will be reduced. Economy class fares range from US$240 to US$350. American nationals in Shanghai are somewhat relieved to hear this news. However, according to reporters, there are very few low-priced economy class tickets left. Only two cabins with fares of US$240 remain. The remaining economy class cabins all seem to be above US$300. The first-class fare remains at the original price of US$395.

Mondale to Sail to Australia First It is reported that the Mondale is scheduled to set sail from Shanghai on November 3, will sail to Australia, and then return to the United States. The entire journey is expected to take two months. American nationals evacuating on this ship from Shanghai on November 3 will not be able to reach their destination until early next year. It is generally believed that the passengers on the Mondale will mostly be dependents of the U.S. Navy, Marines, and consular staff stationed in Shanghai, as well as some missionaries. Although most American nationals in Shanghai have reserved cabins, they have not yet decided on their exact departure plans, as they are still observing the future developments in the Far East situation.

American Nationals in Shanghai to be Fully Evacuated This Year Local American Shipping Companies Say "Non-Essential" American Nationals to Leave Almost Entirely on Evacuation Ships According to current plans, slightly over two thousand "non-essential" American nationals in Shanghai and a small number of American nationals in the interior will all leave. The rumor that Nippon Yusen Kaisha (NYK) and Dollar Line are "cooperating" in the evacuation of American nationals has now been confirmed. NYK has also halved the freight costs for the evacuation of American nationals' furniture. While NYK's steamship fares are much lower, most American nationals are willing to depart on American steamships.

President Lines Begins Selling Tickets Simultaneously, local shipping companies yesterday (the 25th) began pre-selling tickets for the Dollar Steamship Company's Mondale ship. This ship is the first evacuation ship to arrive in Shanghai and is now scheduled to set sail from Shanghai on November 3. The Dollar Line's other evacuation ship, the Mariposa, is expected to arrive in Shanghai on November 15 and set sail the next day, while the Washington postal ship is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai at the end of November.

### German Intelligence Officer Hosts Various Circles, Shows Films of Western Front as Entertainment

Mr. Korde, an intelligence officer from the German Embassy, showed films of the Western Front battles at the German Embassy on Great Western Road at 3:30 PM on Thursday of this week, and provided refreshments to Chinese and foreign journalists. Starting on the 24th, he hosted well-known Chinese businessmen, students from famous Shanghai universities, German medical students, and celebrities from the medical community at the same location.

### Foreign Observers Criticize Peace Rumors as Absurd, Diplomatic Situation Increasingly Favorable to China, China's Determination to Continue Resistance is Firm

Following a London telegram stating that the Japanese side has proposed peace terms to Chairman Chiang, the Chinese government has solemnly denied it, denouncing it as an absurd rumor. Yesterday, a certain foreign observer in this port stated that recently, due to the increasingly favorable diplomatic situation for China, with Britain opening the Burma Road and the United States continuously providing China with military supplies and loans, China's determination to continue its resistance is becoming even firmer. Therefore, the talk of Sino-Japanese peace negotiations is an absurd rumor.

British, American, French, and Soviet Ambassadors Remain in Chongqing

Since the British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, and the French Ambassador to China, Mr. Cosme, successively left Shanghai and arrived in Chongqing, they have paid visits to the central authorities and maintained close contact. They have also discussed assisting China with the American Ambassador to China, Mr. Johnson, and the Soviet Ambassador to China, Mr. Panyushkin, who are stationed in the wartime capital. Their spirits are very high. The ambassadors are very excited about the opening of the Burma Road and the increasingly favorable global situation for China. In view of the active developments in the Far East situation, in order to maintain contact with the Chinese government, they all intend to be long-term residents in Chongqing. British Ambassador Kerr, who was originally scheduled to return to Shanghai before Christmas, will also postpone his departure from Chongqing.

### Japanese Troops Fleeing From Zhuji Head East Towards Shaoxing, Blocked by Chinese Troops, Mostly Retreat to Qianqing

Although the county seat of Zhuji fell twice, it was eventually recaptured by Chinese troops after encirclement and attack on the 22nd. There are now no traces of Japanese troops in the territory of Zhuji. However, since the 23rd, the war has shifted eastward, and the situation in Shaoxing has become tense. A reporter from the Datong News Agency recently recorded the various clearings as determined.

Zhuji Cleared

According to a Datong News Agency reporter inquiring with groups from Eastern Zhejiang in Shanghai, the Japanese troops in Xiaoshan suddenly invaded Zhuji from Fengqiao Town starting on the 8th of this month. The county seat of Zhuji fell on the 17th. After Chinese reinforcements arrived continuously and surrounded and attacked the county seat, it was recaptured on the 19th. The next day, the Japanese troops stubbornly attacked again, reaching the outskirts of the city. On the 22nd, the city was recaptured after a combined attack by Chinese troops. There are no traces of Japanese troops in the territory of Zhuji.

Shaoxing War

Since the Japanese troops retreating from Zhuji gathered at the Sanjiangkou on the south bank of the Qianjiang River, they suddenly fled eastward in groups on the 23rd, reaching Zhaojiabu in the territory of Shaoxing, and then advanced to Lizhu Town. Another group fled from Qianqing Town to Ruanshe above Keqiao, and Chinese troops were also dispatched to block them. The Japanese troops have been exhausted. The Japanese troops in Lizhu have fled back to Zhaojiabu, and most of the Japanese troops in Ruanshe have also retreated to the Qianqing and Xijian areas. There are still a few who have been surrounded by Chinese troops layer by layer, and it will not be difficult to eliminate them.

Keqiao and Shaoxing are Safe

Although the situation in Keqiao and Shaoxing was once tense, it has now turned from danger to safety. The Shanghai-Shaoxing telegram is still being received and sent without hindrance. According to a Datong News Agency reporter inquiring with the Shaoxing Seven Counties Association, the association received a telegram from the Shaoshao Relief Association stationed in Shaoxing the day before yesterday, reporting that "Shaoxing is safe, and local gentry and merchants are stationed in the city and working as usual," which further proves the stability of the situation in Shaoxing. The Ningbo and Yuyao areas are as safe as usual, and postal and telecommunications traffic is unimpeded.

### After the Estonian Consulate was Searched, the Harbin Consul Arrived in Shanghai for Negotiations

Since the Estonian Consulate in this port was searched by the judicial police of the Shanghai Municipal Council under the order of the Chinese court, the liaison officer of the consulate is now waiting for Mr. Lomas, the former director of the Estonian Consulate in Harbin, to come to Shanghai to handle negotiations. Mr. Lomas was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 24th, but it is said that he was obstructed due to some reason and is expected to arrive in Shanghai on the Qingdao Maru ship at 4:00 PM today.

### Creditors' Meeting of Tonghe Bank Adjourned Again Yesterday

The case of Tonghe Commercial Savings Bank applying for reconciliation with the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce has been adjourned repeatedly. Yesterday at 3:00 PM, a creditors' meeting of the bank's commercial department creditors was convened at the 5th floor of the Bank Association on Hong Kong Road. Until 4:00 PM, the number of attendees was still insufficient for a quorum, so it was adjourned again. It has now been scheduled to reconvene at 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the upper first day of next month.

### Today is U.S. Navy Day, Admiral Hart Issues Commemorative Speech, Formally Tells American Nationals in Shanghai to Protect Their Rights, All Officers and Soldiers Prepared to Fulfill Their Responsibilities

Today is U.S. Navy Day. Admiral Hart, Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, has issued a proclamation to commemorate it, translated as follows: "The flagship of the Asiatic Fleet is unfortunately unable to be with you because it has been dispatched to a scheduled exercise. On Navy Day in the United States, American citizens have the opportunity to get closer to the Navy so as to learn about the duties and situation of the Navy. However, American nationals in Shanghai are already well aware from experience of the important role the Navy plays in protecting the lives of American nationals abroad and maintaining their rights, and there is no need to dwell on it. You also know that the U.S. Navy must be fully equipped and ready to play this role at any time. The urgent need for this is greater today than at any time in our republic's history. I can assure you that the officers and soldiers under my command fully understand their duties and responsibilities, and that they and the warships they serve on are prepared to fulfill these duties and responsibilities."

### The Navies of Both Oceans are Unparalleled in the World

The U.S. Navy was established by Congress on October 1775 with only two warships and twenty-four cannons. Today, it has 407 warships totaling 1,343,155 tons. Its front line in the Pacific extends from Alaska to the southern tip of South America, and in the Atlantic, it extends from Greenland to the Southern Ocean. It is the largest and strongest navy in the world.

Five-Year Plan

Completed on Schedule

Recently, in view of the expansion of the European war and the threats from the Far East, the United States has passed a new bill approving a fund of 300 million US dollars to build an unprecedented U.S. Great Navy. All shipyards across the country are participating in the work, and it is expected that a new ship can be built every three days. This plan is scheduled to be completed before 1946 with 700 new ships, with a total tonnage more than three times the current status. It is said that this new plan intends to build more than 800 warships, including 45 battleships, 45 aircraft carriers, 101 cruisers, 435 destroyers, and 220 submarines, which are expected to be launched in 1945 and 1946.

Building Bases in the Pacific This new plan was proposed by Roosevelt and approved by Congress, with the support of 97.5% of the people of the country. It will enable the United States to have a fleet in both the East and West Oceans that exceeds the combined strength of any world navy in terms of both quantity and tonnage. At the beginning of this new plan, the United States immediately began negotiations to lease several new naval bases for this huge fleet to be stationed. In the Pacific, it is also preparing to build bases more than 4,000 miles long. At the same time as the shipbuilding plan, naval aviation will also be developed, and Congress has approved another 600 million US dollars to build naval fighters and train 30,000 pilots.

Never Lost a Battle in History U.S. Navy Secretary Knox once declared that the U.S. Navy is prepared to fight to defend the interests of Americans all over the world. Today, thousands of Westerners in various parts of the United States are signing up to join the Navy to provide manpower for the huge fleet. Because the shipbuilding process is underway, naval reservists around the world have been ordered to join the Navy. The U.S. military has never been defeated in history. It has participated in four major wars and has never lost a battle. Therefore, it is now prepared to take on its due mission.

General Strength of the Asiatic Fleet At present, the United States has six large aircraft carriers carrying hundreds of aircraft that can operate in the Pacific, 18 heavy cruisers, 19 light cruisers, and more than 200 destroyers (with a total tonnage of more than 300,000). More than a thousand submarines that have been ordered to stand by and can be used are also available. The flagship of the U.S. Navy Asiatic Fleet, the Augusta, weighs 10,000 tons, and its base is now in Manila. In addition, 13 heavy cruisers and destroyers and 6 submarines are currently stationed in various parts of the Far East to protect the lives, property, and interests of American nationals in the Far East. The base of this fleet is in Hawaii. Affiliated to the Asiatic Fleet are also 6 gunboats, which are currently stationed on various coasts and can enter the interior for more than a thousand miles, the farthest being in Chongqing. Others are stationed in Hong Kong, Shanghai, Yantai, Shantou, and Tianjin.

### Qians Jia Lane in Western Shanghai Unblocked

Most of the Residents Detained by the Japanese Side Have Been Released

The Mainland News reports that after a Japanese military police sergeant, Saito Seiichi, was assassinated on Yuyuan Road last week, the Japanese authorities immediately implemented restrictions in the western district and successively detained more than 300 Chinese residents. Most of them have been released, but a small number of those arrested are still being detained for further investigation. It is also reported that Qians Jia Lane, where the incident occurred, was opened yesterday.

### Method for Amortizing War Losses

Losses Not Fully Amortized in Eight Years

Deducted from 29th Year's Profit

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday issued a notice to various trade associations regarding the method for amortizing war losses, as approved by the Ministry of Finance, stating: "With due respect, on September 18, the Money Trade Association forwarded a letter from its member Fuli Zhuang, stating that the store's entire property, equipment, and decoration, worth 10,000 yuan, were completely lost in the war in the 28th year. The profits earned in the same year were higher than the amount of the loss. In accordance with the Measures for the Excess Profits Tax on Profitable Enterprises During the Emergency Period, the loss will be amortized over ten years. One-tenth of the loss has been deducted from the 28th year's profit account. If the store closes down at the end of the 29th year, nine-tenths of the loss cannot be amortized annually. It can be deducted from the 29th year's profit account. The store has requested that the matter be forwarded to the Ministry of Finance for approval." After the Chamber forwarded the matter on September , we received approval from the Ministry of Finance on October 24, bearing the Yu character No. 5642, which states: "Having read the report, the war losses not fully amortized in the 28th year are approved to be deducted from the 29th year's profit account. Please inform accordingly." This Chamber has investigated that this method of amortization approved by the Ministry can be used as a basis for all industries, and a special letter is sent to inform you, hoping that you will investigate and forward it to the trade associations.

### Supplementary Expenditures in the French Concession to be Cancelled Next Year

Vehicles Without Pneumatic Tires

Registration to be Refused on a Fixed Date

The Board of Directors of the French Concession Council, because iron-wheeled vehicles traveling on the roads easily damage the road surface, resolved that from December 1, 1940, vehicles without pneumatic tires will not be registered. At the same time, the Council resolved and approved the report of the Director of the Financial Department's accounts for the first half of 1940. It also resolved to approve the recommendation of the Finance Committee to cancel all expenditures under the supplementary budget item from January 1, 1941, which should be transferred to the current budget.

### Deputy Secretary-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council Should be Replaced by a Chinese National, Most of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Taxes are Taken From Chinese Nationals, Dissatisfaction Expressed Over Promoting Allen to the Position

Recently, due to the departure of many American staff members in the Public Concession Council due to the European situation, the Chinese taxpayers in the Concession do not agree with the Council's promotion of the British acting Deputy Secretary-General Allen to the position of Deputy Secretary-General. The Public Concession Council is now facing difficulties in finding a suitable candidate for Deputy Secretary-General due to the departure of British and American nationals, so the Council should be cautious and ensure that the successor can live up to the expectations of the public. According to the amount of taxes paid in the Concession, Chinese nationals account for an absolute majority, so the position of Deputy Secretary-General should be filled by a Chinese national.

### Rice Price Assessment to be Discussed on Tuesday, Implementing Evaluation Procedures

After the Rice Price Assessment Committee drafted the standard principles for assessing the purchase and sale prices of foreign rice in the market, the authorities of the two Concessions separately convened meetings, revised, and approved them. It is said that they will send letters to the Committee. In order to comply with the intentions of the Concession authorities, the Committee has decided to convene a committee meeting next Tuesday to discuss the implementation procedures and distribution of work. Once these principles are implemented, all purchases and sales of foreign rice must be transacted at the production price and given a legal profit of 5%. If the price exceeds the production price, it will be considered an illegal transaction. Yesterday, the rice price continued to fall by about one yuan. The highest market price of foreign rice will enter 60 yuan. It is learned that the amount of domestic rice shipped to Shanghai has recently increased again, and a large amount is scheduled to arrive today.

### Master of Astrology, Old Brand Authority, True Left-Hand Writer

Medicine can cure diseases. A good doctor is hard to find. Divination can resolve doubts. A famous master is hard to find. When people have doubts that need to be resolved by divination, they are often very careful in selecting the diviner's ink, character, and history, just as patients carefully select a good doctor. The old brand true left-hand writer from Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Shanghai has profound knowledge of Chinese classics and is versed in divination, astrology, and other books. In terms of character: he speaks directly and resolves doubts for people. He does not mention superstition, does not set up altars, and does not use charms. In terms of history: he has been in Shanghai for more than ten years and has been praised by Chinese and foreigners alike. He is indeed a rare master of astrology and is even more suitable for the selective conditions of the public.

### Three Days of Sudden Cold: Corpses Pile Up on the Streets, Averaging Over a Hundred Deaths Per Day, Totaling 346 Bodies

Since the 24th, the city's climate suddenly turned cold, and only slightly warmed up yesterday afternoon. However, the sudden cold for three days has led to a sharp increase in the number of corpses frozen to death on the streets. Yesterday, a reporter from the Pingming News Agency inquired at the Public Concession's Pushan Villa and learned that in the past three days, the number of corpses frozen to death on the streets was as follows: On the 24th, there were 26 adults and 47 children; on the 25th, there were 33 adults and 48 children; and yesterday, there were 27 adults and 42 children. The reporter also inquired at the French Concession's Tongren Fuyuan Hall and learned that on the 24th, they buried 24 adult corpses and 13 child corpses; on the 25th, they buried 28 adult corpses and 21 child corpses; and last night, they buried 21 adult corpses and 16 child corpses. Therefore, in the past three days, a total of 159 adult corpses and 187 child corpses have been found, totaling as many as 346 bodies. However, the number of various infectious diseases has decreased, and true cholera has disappeared, but many people are suffering from colds, coughs, and throat ailments.

Three Religions Distribute Congee Vouchers

The Shanghai Three Religions Moral Benevolent Society's Fundraising Committee distributes congee vouchers by district to benefit the refugees on the streets, which is not a small contribution. Recently, the society, considering that the severe winter has arrived and that the wandering refugees on the streets are suffering from hunger and cold, in a more miserable state than those in the shelters, appealed to all sectors to generously donate and actively contribute to expand the relief efforts for the refugees on the streets, or personally distribute the vouchers to effectively implement relief work. To purchase congee vouchers, please go to the gift certificate departments of the Sincere Company on Nanjing Road and the Lihua Company at the Embankment Building, which are acting as sales agents. For telephone donations, please call 91067 to contact them. Each congee voucher costs six cents and can be used to redeem a bowl of twelve ounces of white congee. Each book of fifty vouchers costs three yuan. For you, it is an easy task, accumulating virtue and bringing blessings; for the refugees, it can prevent starvation and bring endless benefits. It is also learned that the special congee distribution points of the society are: Xing Sheng Zhai at 307 Aierjin Road in the Public Concession; Geng Longxing at 34 Shandong Road; Ma Xinglong at 38 Yu Qiaqing Road; Lu Yuanxing at 36 Maigen Road; Zai Desheng at 373 Robert Sheng Road; Jiang Xing next to the Fire Brigade at the Wujiaochang in Caojiadu; Ma Fuxing opposite the White Palace on Daxi Road; Nan Mao Xinglong at 101 Annakin Road in the French Concession; Hongfa at 42 Lafayette Road; Zhu Fuxing at 173 Caishi Road; Shunxing at 2020 Haig Road; and Wugu Zhai on Pu'en Jishi Road.

### Regulating Food Supply in Four Provinces

The food bureaus of Zhejiang, Fujian, Anhui, and Jiangxi provinces recently held a food conference, attended by the persons in charge of the food administration offices of each province. After careful discussion, the following key proposals were passed: (1) To increase the funds available to the food administration offices of each province as much as possible to purchase grain stored by the people. The funds will be guaranteed by the local banks of each province and loaned by the Central, China, Communications, and Farmers' Banks. (2) The surplus grain in Jiangxi Province, in addition to supplying military needs, should be used to relieve the grain-deficient areas of Zhejiang and Anhui provinces as much as possible. (3) The surplus grain in southern Anhui, in addition to supplying its own needs, should be used to relieve the people of western Zhejiang. (4) The war zone should strictly order each province to direct its subordinate counties to universally carry out winter plowing to increase production and make up for the shortage. (5) Zhejiang Province has suffered a severe drought this year, and the autumn harvest is poor, averaging only about 60% of normal. It is already difficult to cope with the people's food needs and cannot bear the responsibility of purchasing military grain.

### British Government Approves Jewish Immigration to Engage in Industrial Cooperative Movement

Only Jews Willing to Make a Living in Shanghai

The Continental Daily reports that a large number of Jewish refugees from Germany and Austria have come to Shanghai to seek refuge, but most of them have no way to make a living. Therefore, American and local Jewish relief organizations are trying to relocate these refugees elsewhere to enable them to support themselves. It was previously reported that no fewer than three plans had been drawn up to relocate them to Yunnan Province and other places, but all failed. Recently, the Jewish community in this city received a telegram from the National Refugee Service in New York, stating that the British government has approved the relocation of 60 to 80 Jewish refugee families from Shanghai, each with 600 yuan, to the British Honduras colony in Central America to engage in an industrial cooperative movement, manufacturing furniture, toys, embroidery, and cigarettes. Once the Jewish community in this city registers the full number of people willing to go to that place, the National Refugee Service in New York will send personnel to guide the relocation. However, according to the opinions of the general Jewish refugees in this city, most of them came from large cities in Germany and Austria and are not accustomed to the simple life of industrial cooperation. Moreover, those who have 600 yuan in cash would rather make a living here.

### Fu Xiaoan's Coffin Passes Through: Both Concessions on Alert; Roads Along the Route Temporarily Blocked

After Fu Xiaoan's assassination, it was decided that his remains would be buried this morning. The Japanese side previously requested the concession authorities to allow the procession to pass through the concession and directly through the main roads such as Nanjing Road and Avenue Joffre. The Public Concession authorities refused passage through Nanjing Road, considering it the safest area to secure, but after repeated requests from the Japanese side, they finally allowed passage through a section of Nanjing Road from the Bund to Jiangxi Road, and implemented temporary security measures during the passage of the coffin. Therefore, at 10:30 this morning, the traffic on the following roads will be temporarily blocked: (1) The Bund and all lateral roads east of Henan Road and west of the Bund (from Suzhou Road to Avenue Edward VII); (2) All roads from Guangdong Road to Avenue Edward VII (from the Bund to Yu Qiaqing Road); (3) Also, at 11:45 a.m., Haig Road (from Xinzha Road) to Jessfield Road, Avenue Road and all roads between Hart Road and Diphong Road will also be blocked at 11:45 a.m., and will be opened after the procession passes. The Public Works Department reserves team and the White Russian merchant corps were dispatched along the route. The French Concession also took similar actions and temporarily cut off traffic on the roads through which the procession passed. The Shanghai Times reported that the Public Works Department has allowed the procession to pass through the Public Concession during Fu Xiaoan's funeral tomorrow (the 27th). A Public Works Department police officer stated that some roads near the route will be blocked and the police will take special security measures. According to announcements from the city center, the funeral procession will start from Scott Road, first to the city center, then along Dixwell Road, Broadway Road, across the Garden Bridge, to the Bund, turn into Nanjing Road, along Yu Qiaqing Road into Avenue Joffre, and then along Xinzha Road and Haig Road to Yuyuan Road, ending at Zhaofeng Funeral Parlor.

### Shanghai Woolen Mill Owner Xu Shuliang Has Escaped Danger Six Bandits Captured by Jing'an Temple Police After Xu Was Kidnapped from His Residence on Yuyuan Road

Xu Shuliang, a Ningbo native and owner of the Shanghai Woolen Mill on Rue du Père Robert, lived at No. 77 Yugu Village, Yuyuan Road, West Shanghai. On the 18th of this month, Xu was suddenly invaded by many armed bandits at his residence, who kidnapped Xu and hid him, sending letters to his family, intending to demand a ransom of 200,000 yuan. The matter was detected by Tang Jian, Yao Jiawei, Ni Jiafeng, and Zhu Chiqing, Chinese detectives of the Jing'an Temple Police, that bandits involved in this case were hiding in the Nanjing Hotel at No. 1, Lane 90, Rue Way Garnier, French Concession. They went to the Nanjing Hotel with French Concession detectives and arrested five bandits, Li Ruitang, Wang Bin, Meng Qinghai, Xu Lin, and Yan Shisan, in rooms No. 1 and No. 14. They learned that the victim was hiding at No. 18, Fahua Town, West Shanghai, and then, together with the Japanese Gendarmerie, secretly went there at about 1 a.m. yesterday to rescue the victim Xu Shuliang, along with Li Guangtai, a Hebei native, the landlord of the two rooms where the victim was held, and brought them back to headquarters. The Li criminal was transferred to the police station for detention. At about 9 a.m. yesterday, the six criminals were escorted to the Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The police lawyer Li Zhishan stated the case and requested detention. When questioned, the defendants confessed without denial. Yan Shisan was the driver, and Li Guangtai was the landlord of the two rooms where the victim was held. The remaining four, Li Ruitang and others, were the kidnappers. The court ordered them to be detained and interrogated again in seven days. It is reported that four other accomplices have been arrested and are being held at the Japanese headquarters.

### Beggar Asks for Alms, Takes Opportunity to Rob, Sentenced to Six Months

The day before yesterday afternoon, when a wealthy woman, Kang Le, came out of the Wing On Company and sat in her private car No. 4446, a beggar, A, came forward to ask for alms. Mrs. Kang took money from her handbag to give to him. However, the beggar took the opportunity to snatch the handbag, which contained more than 200 yuan in legal tender. At that time, Huang Yangfu, a Chinese detective from the Old Zha Police Station, happened to pass by and arrested the beggar along with the stolen goods. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The police lawyer Qian Xunjiu stated that the plaintiff in this case saw that the defendant was pitiful, so she took ten yuan from her handbag, but the defendant took the opportunity to rob her handbag. His wickedness is unforgivable and hinders other poor people, making philanthropists wary. Therefore, he requested severe punishment to deter future offenders. After deliberation by Judge Xiao, it was decided to sentence him to six months in prison as a warning, and the stolen goods were returned.

### African Circus Sued for Advertising Fees Puyi Advertising Agency Sues for Recovery

The "African Circus," which once performed opposite the Xieqiao Assembly Hall on Jing'an Temple Road, failed and left Shanghai for Suzhou. However, it suffered a setback and is now in a difficult situation. Before the troupe performed in Shanghai, a Cantonese man, Chen Songgen, also known as Chen Huajin, the owner of the Nanhua National Goods Store at No. 6, Lane 225, Guizhou Road, suddenly had a strange idea in May of this year and partnered with several friends to set up the Shunli Company at No. 119 Renji Road to organize this African Circus. During the performance, they published large advertisements in major newspapers to attract customers. All the advertisements were entrusted to the Puyi Advertising Agency in Youxin Lane, Jiujiang Road. Unexpectedly, the troupe ended in mid-June due to business losses, resulting in advertising fees of 929 yuan, 1 jiao, and 3 fen. The agency sent letters to Chen to urge payment, but to no avail. Finally, they entrusted lawyer Wu Zhiping to send a warning letter, but he was always procrastinating. Helpless, they filed a lawsuit in the Civil Court of the First Special District Court. The case was heard by Judge Xu Fuyi in the second hearing yesterday. Chen Songgen was absent and appointed lawyer Chen Tingrui to act as his agent, claiming that Chen had become an American citizen and was relying on a Philippine certificate. The manager of the Shunli Company testified in court that the advertising fee was indeed a fact, but that the matter was being cleared up, so the books were all at Chen Songgen's place. After verifying the statements in court, it was decided to reschedule the hearing for November 9.

### Letter

To the Editor of Shenbao:

I am writing to you in response to a news item in your October 23rd issue entitled "Lawsuit over Chinese Medical College," which stated, "The directors, including Ma Wenwo, believed that the college was profitable and competed fiercely. They first expelled Zhu Wenming, one of the founders of the college, who was also the director of general affairs, causing turmoil in the college. Qin Bowei saw that Ma and others regarded the school as a commercial tool and could not cooperate, so he resigned. Then Ma and others transferred the college to Zhu Hegao... A complicated school dispute was completely resolved." This is not consistent with the facts. The strike of the entire student body of the college was not caused by my dispute with Mr. Ma, but entirely by Mr. Qin Bowei's resignation. That is, the dispute between Mr. Ma and myself was also caused by Mr. Qin's resignation, which led to the student strike. This is an undeniable fact that cannot be denied. Furthermore, the 2,000 yuan debt owed by Mr. Guo Boliang has been settled, and Mr. Ma and I have repaid it proportionally. However, the lawsuit between Mr. Ma and I has not been resolved and is currently on appeal. The above report is obviously a misrepresentation. I am writing to you specifically to request that your newspaper correct it as soon as possible to correct the rumors. Thank you.

Sincerely,
Zhu Wenming
October 27th

### US Enacts Conscription

The conscription system that the United States has decided to implement marks the third instance in its 150-year history. What sets this instance apart from the previous two is that during the Civil War and the First World War, the United States only implemented conscription during actual combat. This time, however, in light of the urgent situation in Europe and Asia, and as a precautionary measure, it is making large-scale preparations in advance. Last month, 16.5 million young men in the United States, aged 25 to 35, began registering in preparation for enlistment. The official registration date was set for October 16th, as decided by President Roosevelt. From this vast number, the most qualified four million will be selected, and then 800,000 will be drafted each year for military training. Thus, by 1945, these four million men can be formed into a new army.

Generally, those who cherish freedom deeply resent conscription, a sentiment that has existed since the time of Napoleon. People believe that it is nothing more than the oppression of ordinary people by warlords. This conscription practice was implemented in Europe much earlier than in the United States. Besides France, Norway, and Sweden, wherever the registered number is 258, the individual must report to the local inspector to determine the final selection. At that time, the first batch of 4,500 people began to enlist. This time, they will follow the same method to conscript the first batch of new soldiers. Anyone deemed qualified by the local inspectors will begin military service. Countries such as Switzerland and Czechoslovakia have also followed suit. In Denmark, even priests and pastors are not exempt from conscription. France, which transitioned from an imperial system to a republic, stipulated that citizens who reach the age of 30 must enlist for one year of military service, followed by an obligation to be called up for service at any time for the next 27 years. Britain implemented conscription before the last World War. During that war, the total number of soldiers conscripted exceeded four million.

The United States first implemented conscription during the Civil War, which was largely seen by the people as an extremely unpleasant forced order. As a result, there were disturbances and acts of defiance during the conscription period. The second instance was during the last World War, when the public's perception of military service had changed, and the authorities provided earnest guidance at all times, resulting in a very satisfactory outcome. On June 5, 1917, ten million people registered for enlistment. In the following days, it increased to fourteen million. The authorities then selected 2.8 million people from among them and sent them to the European front to help the Allied countries fight.

After the registration procedures were completed, the serial numbers of those to be drafted were drawn in Washington. In 1917, Mr. Baker, with his eyes tightly closed, drew the number "One Two Five Eight" from a large glass tank, thus beginning a life. This kind of life, to ordinary people, is truly entering a strange realm. During this year of training, one cannot act at will, cannot sleep late, cannot enjoy the comfort of home life, has no good food to eat, cannot do a satisfying job, and has no luxuries to enjoy. In short, all the free air that free people in a free country can enjoy will now be subject to a layer of constraints.

The 130 million people who are not conscripted will also be affected by the conscription system, though not directly enlisted. One thing they cannot avoid is that in the first year, they must bear 1.6 billion yuan in military expenses. If the fate of this time is the same as in 1917, then these people will inevitably see batches of young and strong American men sacrificing their lives for the country on the battlefields of Europe or elsewhere.

Not everyone being trained this month will carry weapons. Today's warfare is completely mechanized. Military factories, aircraft fields, warehouses, repair stations, transportation stations, and other places all require a large number of people to work. To maintain one soldier fighting on the front line, six to ten people in the rear must prepare everything for him. At present, the need for specialized technical talent is even more important than in 1917. Thousands upon thousands of people are needed to work in various factories of the defense industry, but in terms of technology, only skilled workers can be competent.

The United States is the most developed country in the world in terms of mechanical industry. The greatness of the new national defense force can be inferred from the large number of its mechanical knowledge talents. Therefore, not to mention mechanized units, but if mechanized units are used as a standard, the United States can be said to be the leader of all countries. Take the automobile alone, and other things can be inferred.

Assuming the male population of the United States is 65 million, of which 40 million have considerable production work, or at least they have this talent. Of these, 32% are employed in factories, ranking first; those engaged in agriculture account for 25%, ranking second; those engaged in business rank third, estimated at 13%; transportation and commerce account for 9%; in addition, there are those engaged in clerical work, specialized skills, national government service, and agriculture, mining, and fishing. Among these many reserved manpower, those aged 18 to 45 may number 27 million, compared to 24 million in 1917. Therefore, experts claim that if only 900,000 people are drawn out each year for military training in the next five years, the various industrial and commercial businesses of the country will not be significantly affected.

### Trotsky's Cremation

Trotsky was assassinated at his residence outside Mexico City on August 20th of this year (see the special report "The Death of Trotsky" in this newspaper on September 30th) and died the next day. His body was moved to the Beton Cemetery for cremation on August 27th. The deceased's heart and brain had been removed, and he was fully dressed except for shoes. In addition to several of his close friends, there was also a foreign photographer present. Before the cremation, the body was first carried in a steel car to a brick-built furnace. The furnace door was then closed, and flames surrounded Trotsky's body, raging upwards. Then, after an hour and forty minutes of cremation, the body was burned into six pounds of ashes. There were no prayers or rituals during the cremation, only the tolling of a mourning bell. The ashes were removed from the furnace and placed in a shallow basin; a portion of them was placed in a silver-plated bottle as a permanent memorial. The bottle was tied with black mourning gauze, and the name "Leon Trotsky" was engraved on the outside of the bottle. He had nothing else.

### An Independent Character

— Wan

A newborn infant, apart from being born with the ability to suckle, is dependent on its mother for changing clothes and feeding. Gradually, as it grows, it becomes able to dress itself, feed itself, and walk by itself. However, the timing of when a child can act independently in life varies, depending on the mother's attitude towards the child! If a mother spoils her child, then even when the child is over ten years old, he or she will not be able to dress himself or herself, or tidy up his or her belongings. I believe that such a child is the most unfortunate, because he or she will never do anything. Children, ask yourselves how many things you can do independently? Does your mother do everything for you?

An independent character is the most important condition for dealing with matters and conducting oneself in life. It enables us to have decisiveness, to do what is right immediately, without having to worry or need the help of others. It can cultivate our habit of diligence, to do everything personally, whether trivial, important, or difficult, without relying on teachers or parents, feeling that only by doing it ourselves can we achieve satisfactory results. It can give us the courage to act without being timid or hesitant. With this independent character, we will be able to overcome adverse environments, solve all difficulties, and accomplish great undertakings in the future.

How do we cultivate an independent character? I will now briefly describe it below for the reference of the children:

1. Start with daily life: In our homes, we should start by folding our quilts, drinking tea, tidying up the house, and doing all other trivial things ourselves, without our mothers or servants doing them for us. If your mother tries to stop you, you should ask her to let you try it once. If you do a good job, your mother will not interfere in the future.

2. Start with academics: Children go to school to study, often reading because they are punished by the teacher or for the sake of grades. This passive method only results in some dead knowledge. Therefore, children must obtain living knowledge by seeking it themselves, making full use of self-study time, researching diligently in their spare time, in order to obtain true knowledge.

Children, we all know that relying on others is unreliable, and sometimes we will be deceived. Only by using our own thoughts, our own physical strength, and acting independently can we enrich our knowledge, sharpen our minds, and strengthen our bodies in preparation for undertaking all major responsibilities and contributing to society and the nation.

### Body Temperature

— Jin Zhen

Recently, there is a so-called Shanghai disease prevalent on the isolated island, which is characterized by fever all over the body, with a very high temperature. However, after taking some antipyretic medicine, one can recover within a week. Ah Hui was occasionally careless, and on that day when the streets were flooded with water and boats were sailing on land, he still went to school, fearing that he might catch a cold, and was also infected with this epidemic. He stayed in bed, feeling very uncomfortable, and had to ask for a week's sick leave from school. Only recently did he recover, but he has lost a lot of weight, and it took him a lot of time to make up for the missed classes at school, which was very laborious. He told himself never to take leave again, unless there was an emergency.

Although he was sick for a week, he encountered a problem that he had never thought of before, and of course, he went to ask his brother to solve it.

"Brother, why do we get a fever when we are sick?"

"Fever is a sign of illness, and this sign is unique to homeothermic animals. This is because the thermoregulatory center is stimulated by pathogens. In the febrile human body, it is not that the ability to regulate body temperature is incomplete, the regulatory function still exists, so the thermoregulatory center is not paralyzed. Therefore, after taking some antipyretic medicine and with appropriate rest, the fever can subside. From this, we can know that antipyretic medicine is a kind of anesthetic, and it can be determined that fever is a stimulation phenomenon of the thermoregulatory center. Then, what is it in the body that generates heat? According to the research of a foreigner named Mei, he said that the place with the highest temperature in the body during fever is the hepatic venous blood. Once there is a fever, the liver glycogen contained in the liver gradually decreases, and the urine is definitely more during fever, so the excretion of nitrogen in the urine increases. This is the toxic effect of the virus, which decomposes proteins in the body, so the rise in body temperature is also one of the causes of decomposition. After the body temperature rises, the number of breaths and heartbeats also increases, and at the same time, the metabolic function in the body increases, which often leads to unexpected dangers. We are warm-blooded animals, and if our body temperature increases by six degrees Celsius above normal, we will die. In other words, the body temperature of a healthy person is 37 degrees, and if it reaches 43 degrees, we cannot live. Moreover, we cannot eat anything when we have a fever, so the fat usually stored in the body is decomposed and used, so we lose weight when we are sick. As for what is called a homeothermic animal? Any animal whose body temperature has a certain temperature is called a homeothermic animal. For example, we humans are also homeothermic animals, because our body temperature is fixed, that is, no matter what kind of person, their body temperature must be 37 degrees Celsius, no more, no less, otherwise they will get sick. Homeothermic animals are also called warm-blooded animals. And cold-blooded animals do not have cold blood, that is, their body temperature is not fixed, and it changes with the temperature. So why is their body temperature not fixed? This is because the device that maintains the temperature in the body is incomplete, that is, the temperature in the body is directly scattered from the epidermis of the body, and cannot be stored. Also, because the function of regulating body temperature is lacking, that is, if the body temperature is too high, it cannot be lowered, and if it is too low, it cannot be raised, because there is no autonomy, it can only change with the outside temperature. Like turtles hibernating in winter, it is also for this reason, and they actually don't want to hibernate, but there is no way!"

### How to Watch Movies

— Yang Chunlv

There is not a single child who doesn't like to watch movies. Every Sunday, when school is out, parents often take you to see movies.

Watching movies is indeed the happiest thing. Inside are interesting stories, much more vivid than what we see in books or hear with our ears. There are also many rare and wonderful things, beautiful scenery, and pleasant songs, which can enhance our knowledge, cultivate our temperament, and delight our minds and bodies.

However, when you enter the movie theater, there are a few things to pay attention to:

1. Choose a seat, not too close to the screen, as it hurts the eyes; nor too far away, as you can't see clearly. It is best to sit in the middle rows.

2. After settling down, first read the explanation, to get a general idea of the plot of the whole film, so that you can understand it at a glance during the accompanying performance, and there will be no places you don't understand. After the show, it is best to take a close look at the photos on the broken frame, so that you can promote your aftertaste and increase a lot of interest.

3. In the movie theater, you should not wear a hat, otherwise you will hinder other people's sight. Do not spit or talk and laugh loudly. Do not clap your hands and cheer when you are happy, as it is annoying.

4. The place where the red light is on is the "emergency exit" for preventing danger, and you must recognize its location to prevent accidents.

5. When the show is over, you should exit in order, not rush.

What is more important is to choose the content of the film carefully. Those obscene and bizarre films are harmful to watch, so it is better not to watch them. Recently, the Dahua Grand Theater is showing the film "Young Edison," which can promote our interest in studying science, and is worth watching. You should pay attention to these things when watching!

### Shirley Temple's Autobiography (19)

— Min

Mr. Sheehan heard that I didn't have a place to take a good nap; and he also heard that my mother had to take me to the public dining room of the studio to eat every day, so he came up with another solution for me. As for this public dining room, it was quite beautiful. The walls were covered with murals, and there was a wonderful smell of food mixed in the air. All the directors, screenwriters, actors, actresses, photographers, sound engineers, extras, and other staff members of the company were eating in this public dining room. When my mother and I sat down together, they all looked at me and smiled slightly. When I started eating, they would come over and greet me, and some would even introduce other actors and actresses to me. They always surrounded me, watching me eat, smiling, and saying funny things; I couldn't help but laugh when I heard them. This short lunch period was very interesting, but according to my mother, it was not appropriate for a child to talk and laugh so much while eating.

Mr. Sheehan heard this, so he said that I should find another place where I could take a good nap and have lunch well, without mixing with other people. So he came up with a solution, and gave me the bungalow that the former big star Lila Hayworth had lived in before she went to Europe. He was very thoughtful, first changing the furnishings in the house, moving out all the large furniture, and replacing it with smaller ones. All the walls were covered with new wallpaper, all with pictures of Mickey Mouse and Mother Goose, which was completely different from Lila Hayworth's wallpaper. Even the former bathroom was specially reduced in size for me, and all the bathtubs and washbasins were naturally replaced with smaller ones to meet my needs. He also gave me another small piano so that I could practice singing at any time. From then on, I could take naps on my own chaise longue in my living room every day, and I could also have lunch at the white-painted table in my own kitchen. As for what I ate, it was all taken care of by my mother personally. I could also use my own telephone to talk to anyone. I could pick flowers in my own garden outside the window to decorate the house.

### God in the Whirlwind (2)

God speaks to people sometimes in a still, small voice. If people pay no attention to the still, small voice, and ignore it, God will surely speak to them in a louder voice, or even in a whirlwind. In the eyes of people, they think that a whirlwind is a natural disaster, and it is extremely painful, but they do not know that it is also a way for God to speak to people. Unfortunately, there are many people in the world who, even when they encounter a whirlwind, cannot see that God is in the whirlwind. Job encountered a whirlwind, but still firmly believed in God's love, obeyed God's will, and acknowledged that this was God speaking to him, so his faith served as an excellent model for us. From his experience, we can learn many lessons:

(1) When life encounters painful things, they seem to be disasters, but they may not be so. Perhaps they are entirely friendly, because they are beneficial to us, they are the voice of God, they are the way God speaks to us. The most important thing is whether we can hear and distinguish that it is the voice of God.

(2) When people encounter unsatisfactory times, or even encounter a whirlwind experience, they think that God is far away from us at this time, and has abandoned us. Little do they know that God is closer to us. It is a pity that we sometimes do not recognize him.

(3) God's justice is always beyond doubt. He never favors anyone, nor does he wrong anyone. If we believe in God and obey God, we will always be blessed. The Book of Job tells us: "And the Lord turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his friends: also the Lord gave Job twice as much as he had before." (Job 42:10)

May the reader pay attention to listening to the voice of God, and it is best not to ignore God's small voice. If, because we have neglected God's small voice, God wants to speak to us in a whirlwind, we must not be stubborn and hard-hearted, and refuse to obey, because we human beings, no matter how stubborn, can never resist God. In the whirlwind, the tender and weak branches of the small tree move with the wind, and after the wind passes, they are safe and sound. Only the large tree with deep roots, which seems to be unharmed, ends up being broken or uprooted. The tree is like this in the wind, and how can people be any different from God?

Arts and Entertainment

### Starting from "Young Edison"

— Lan Li

"Young Edison" has been released at the Dahua Theater. The childhood of this great scientist, under the rendering of the mischievous child Mickey Rooney, is vividly and colorfully active before our eyes, giving us joy and encouragement.

This newspaper has published a special issue for the release of "Young Edison," and is giving away movie tickets to the children who won the prizes in the micro-essay contest, so that these outstanding children can get a free chance to see a meaningful children's film. I am happy for these children.

But although their grades are excellent, the English proficiency of the children is not necessarily good enough to understand foreign films. Of course, smart children can also rely on the instructions and the actions on the screen to get a partial understanding of the story. However, because they cannot understand the dialogue, they lose the essence of it and reduce the fun of the film, which is a great regret, isn't it?

Therefore, I can't help but think of the poverty of Chinese children's films.

Chinese children have always been placed in a corner to grow on their own. If they want to watch movies, they have to follow the adults to watch love, detective, war, and horror movies. These are always somewhat unfamiliar and inexplicable to children. However, Chinese films are originally intended for adults' entertainment, so "children under the age of sixteen are not allowed to watch."

But letting children grow on their own is not a good solution after all. Children's innocence needs more things to satisfy their fantasies, to develop their ignorance, and to develop their talents. Therefore, if the film wants to assume a little responsibility for educating children in addition to entertaining adults, the production of children's films is really urgent.

Since "The Lost Lamb" and "Little Heroine," we have not heard any news about children's films for a long time. Recently, it seems that some people have paid attention to this aspect again. During the period when "Young Edison" arrived, Mr. Wu Yonggang was making "Chinese Snow White." I hope that this will not be a flash in the pan for domestic children's films, and that this line can be grasped in the future. And I hope that the production of children's films should not only be large in quantity, but also good in quality.

### To Organizers and Participants of Concerts

— Bao Mingshan

This year's music season has already begun. In addition to the weekly Sunday concerts held by the Shanghai Municipal Council Orchestra at the Lyceum Theatre, there have been several group performances during this music season, including the "All Shanghai United Harmonica Concert," the "Experimental Amateur Concert," and the "Zhao Meibo's Students Vocal Music Concert," all held at the American Women's Club and the YMCA, achieving great success.

Tonight (Saturday) starting at 8:30 PM, there will be two major music concerts: the "Public Fundraising Harmonica and Accordion Concert" at the Aurora University Auditorium and the "Czech Émigré Charity Concert" at the Cercle Sportif Français Auditorium on Route Pichon. According to the organizers, all the pieces to be performed are world-renowned classics, and all the tickets have been sold. Therefore, the success of these concerts can be predicted. Music-loving ladies and gentlemen should take the opportunity to attend and enjoy the wonderful music.

In recent years, I have been repeatedly invited by various groups to participate in the music concerts they organize. However, I always feel that the following points are often overlooked when holding concerts, which significantly affects the overall quality of the performance.

(1) The choice of venue should depend on the volume of the entire orchestra (or the number of performers).

(2) The night before the official performance, a preliminary concert should be held, inviting music experts and members of the press to attend and provide feedback for improvement.

(3) Special attention should be paid to the location of the venue, ensuring that it is not near a street to avoid external noise from cars and other sources from interfering with the music.

(4) Maintain order within the venue. For example, no one should be allowed to enter or exit during a piece. This is even more strictly enforced in Germany, where audience members are restricted from bringing in coats and hats.

(5) Seating should be assigned according to theater-style numbered tickets to avoid disputes over seats.

Although the above points are easy to implement, they are often overlooked by various groups. Therefore, I hope that more attention will be paid to these points in the future and that all proceeds from ticket sales, after deducting necessary expenses, will be donated for winter clothing.

### Theater News

— Zhi Yao

According to theater operators, Zhang Shankun, the owner of Guolian Film Company, is raising funds to establish a first-run movie theater for domestic films. It is said that some old buildings near the Shanghai Guangming Theater are about to be renovated, and negotiations will proceed if the landlord's terms are not too harsh.

Also, after the change of ownership of the Grand Shanghai Theater, it may follow the example of the Golden Theater by exclusively hiring famous Peking opera actors from Beiping to perform traditional plays. If this plan does not materialize, it will cooperate with Guolian Film Company to screen domestic films.

News of a Famous Amateur Performer's Wedding: Wang Qingxiang, a famous amateur performer and son of the wealthy merchant Wang Weiguan, was taught by the famous actor Xiao Jiao Tian. His famous works include "The Four Heroes Village," "Yaguan Tower," and "Qiankun Circle." His performance of Yu Qian in "The Four Heroes Village" is highly praised for its style and skill. Recently, he performed in a charity performance at the Carlton Hotel to raise funds for Sze Wei Primary School, which received favorable reviews. Wang is a young and handsome man who studies at Nantong University. This spring, through the mediation of entrepreneur Gu Shaoqing, he became engaged to Shao Lizhu, a top student at McTyeire School. Their wedding is scheduled for today (the 27th) at their residence at 590 Route Ghisi, and Mr. Yuan Ludeng will be the officiant. It is expected to be a grand occasion.

The Hawthorne Case

### The Queen of Dance's Destiny

— By Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter 10: The Shoe Problem

After hesitating slightly, I approached the doorway. I grasped the doorknob with my left hand and took out my pistol from my pocket with my right hand. I turned the knob forcefully, and the door opened smoothly. I looked around, but the room was empty.

The room was large, with a row of steel windows facing south, covered by yellow perforated gauze curtains. Although the curtains were drawn, the light was still sufficient. A large copper bed was positioned facing south, with the copper pillars gleaming. It was adorned with white bedding, a pink satin quilt, and embroidered white satin pillows, creating a dazzling display of color. Against the wall was a classical-style teak vanity, covered with various bottles and jars of cosmetics, all expensive imported products. Next to a powder box was a pair of sunglasses, which Lili used for other purposes. There was also a wardrobe, a round table, two silk-covered sofas, a long chair, and a bedside table placed in front of the bed, all in the same style and painted light yellow. In short, the layout here, like the downstairs reception room, was a classic symbol of the extravagance and waste of a nation that had forgotten the times!

I looked around the room and felt that there was no place to hide anyone. Could it be that no one had come upstairs, and my hearing was playing tricks on me? Just then, I heard a slight footstep. I turned around and saw that the door was slowly opening, inch by inch, moving inward. I had not closed the door when I came in, so someone must have come in from outside. The door was opened nearly halfway, and the first thing that came through the crack was a gun barrel!

I quickly dodged, hiding at one end of the wall, crouching down, and focusing my gun on the doorway, preparing for any danger.

"Don't shoot! Bao Lang, it's me!"

It was Hawthorne. I naturally straightened up. I saw that Hawthorne looked very nervous. He put the pistol in his pocket, and his eyes quickly scanned the room.
