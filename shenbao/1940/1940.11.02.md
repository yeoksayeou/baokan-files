### Amidst the Tumultuous Situation in the Far East, China's Diplomatic Policy Remains Unchanged: Responsible Parties Deny Adopting a Pro-Axis Policy; Rumors of Sino-British Discussions on Military Alliance Are Also False

Chongqing - In light of the current tranquility in the Sino-Japanese military situation, the withdrawal of Japanese troops from Nanning, and Hitler's recent diplomatic offensive, many are speculating about possible developments in the Far East. Authoritative sources here solemnly declare that China's diplomatic policy has not undergone any significant changes due to recent international developments. All rumors regarding China's stance should be viewed as pure conjecture. Responsible Chinese officials strongly deny reports from the Japanese side that the National Government is now adopting a pro-Axis policy and that the United States has warned the National Government not to lean towards the Axis powers. These rumors are clearly intended to counteract the relationship between China and Britain and the United States after the reopening of the Burma Road. In fact, since the Manchurian Incident nine years ago, the close relationship between China, Britain, and the United States has never been stronger than it is today. The Chinese government has consistently urged Britain and the United States to take parallel actions in the Far East. On the other hand, the claim that Britain and China are currently discussing a military alliance to resist the Axis powers should also be regarded as a rumor. Since the public signing of the Tripartite Pact by Germany, Italy, and Japan, China has naturally expressed strong opposition to it, but at least outwardly, there has been little change in its relationship with Germany and Italy. Chinese Ambassador to Germany Chen Jie is still stationed in Berlin, and there is still a charg√© d'affaires in Rome. The treatment of German nationals and interests in China is currently no different from what it was before the signing of the Tripartite Pact. Sources here believe that China will inevitably publicly break with Germany if Germany publicly supports Japan's war against China. As for negotiations between China and Britain to enhance relations and cooperation, this is undeniable and natural. These negotiations began after the outbreak of the European war, but the Chinese and British authorities here have not yet announced any specific decisions. (Reuters dispatch from the 1st)

Editorial

### Promoting Five-Year Savings

Savings can be short-term or long-term; among the long-term ones, the period can be different. Why specifically promote five-year savings? It is because contemporary planners, regardless of economy, military affairs, or politics, often take five years as a period. Now, in regular savings, considering the application of construction, assuming five years as the standard, the goal is to achieve universal success in this specific period.

Saving means storing, accumulating means hoarding; storing and hoarding are for preparing for the unexpected. Therefore, ancient teachings say, "Prepare and you shall stand, fail to prepare and you shall fall"; a popular saying also goes, "Always think of days without when you have days with; do not wait until you have nothing to think of when you had". Extending this to insects and animals, most of them store food in spring and summer to prepare for the difficulty of finding food when winter comes. Bees and ants are the obvious examples. Therefore, saving is a virtue common to all animals, but its effectiveness is more evident in humans. However, humans often know little about the value of savings because of the abundance left by their predecessors, or the excessive gains they make at one time, and they become extravagant by nature. When they have used up all their possessions, they realize the harm of an empty pocket, but it is too late. The need to promote savings is for this reason.

The role of savings lies first in the accumulation of time, that is, accumulating bit by bit to become a huge amount. The second is in the collection of space, that is, gathering the small amount of wealth of the majority of people and gathering it into a large amount of capital and great use to build a great cause. The so-called "many grains of sand make a pagoda" and "many fox furs make a robe", before they are gathered, each grain of sand is not seen as valuable. A floating boat carries heavy loads and reaches every distance, and it is nothing more than the accumulation of trickles to become rivers and oceans. Since the development of the banking industry in China, savings have become popular, which has greatly benefited social economy and people's livelihood. It can turn the scattered into the whole, gather the whole into huge sums, invest it in industry and commerce, and use it for domestic and foreign bonds. The period is fixed and the turnover is abundant, the number is very large and the investment is diverse. This is why saving is so valuable. According to people in the industry, the most popular regular savings in people's minds are mostly two-year dividend savings deposits. One is to take a shorter period, and the other is to have dividends to be paid, and the weekly interest is often around eight percent. In fact, it is called two years, but most of them will continue to deposit when they expire. The psychology of depositors is that regular deposits have higher interest rates than current deposits, and they are not good at using them themselves, or they do not wait to use them, so they save them as regular deposits. As a result, it is no different from long-term deposits. However, long-term deposits still need to be promoted, because to cater to the psychology of depositors, the shorter the period and the thicker the interest, the better. But in terms of bank investment and the development of industry and commerce, it takes three to five years for a business to take shape and see results. If the deposit period is short, the bank has to increase its preparation for withdrawal upon maturity and dare not use it for businesses that are more constructive and require considerable operating time. Such preparation without withdrawal and storage without full use are a major loss to the national economy. Therefore, although we believe that savings are valuable, regardless of the length of the term, but in order to adapt to future large-scale construction, we have to promote savings deposits with a slightly longer and fixed period, such as five-year savings. Compared with the two-year term, this period seems to be extended by three years. If we continue to deposit, it is only extended by one and a half times. Compared with the ten-year and fifteen-year terms, it is only two-thirds and one-third, and it cannot be said to be long. In order to promote five-year savings, the interest should be more generous and the guarantee should be reliable, so that depositors can enthusiastically deposit. Those who continue to deposit upon maturity should be given special interest. If this can be done, the use of this deposit can also choose a more appropriate object and receive more significant results. The national authorities are obliged to preside over it, and all commercial banks should be jointly responsible for it, so that the savings of one bank are not enough to run a business, and several banks can join forces to do it. Those who do not want to operate directly can transfer their deposits to other banks and let them take the responsibility of operating. As for how to use the deposit, what kind of business to run, and the guarantee of principal and interest, there should be separate chapters to ensure that the deposit is enthusiastic and that the effect of "many hands make light work" is achieved.

### With Incessant Heavy Rain and Treacherous Mountain Roads, the Italian Army's Offensive Has Made No Progress: Greek Army, Navy, and Air Force Combine Forces in Counterattack; Hand-to-Hand Combat Erupts in Northern Yannina

Athens - With heavy clouds and incessant torrential rain, the Italian army's offensive was somewhat eased yesterday. The Italian air force was also unable to take off from the ground. However, the Greek army did not back down due to the adverse weather, and bravely engaged in a counterattack, repelling two Italian units. The Italian units, after the Greek counterattack was successful, abandoned their armor and dragged their troops away. According to Greek radio, a single unit of Italian troops penetrated deep into Greek territory, but was met with strong resistance from the Greek army. Greek reinforcements arrived one after another and immediately repelled the Italian troops. (United Press dispatch from the 1st)

Athens - Responsible sources here claim that the depth of the Italian army's intrusion into Greek territory is at most only six miles at any point. Italian artillery is shelling Greek army outposts, but Italian troops have not come into contact with the main Greek defense lines. The Italian army is currently using a large number of mobile field guns, which are far superior to those of the Greek army. The Greek-Albanian border is hilly, and there are only three routes available for the Italian army's advance. There is a gap in the high mountain ridge in the northeast, which can lead to Thessaloniki and directly to Florina. The Greek army is closely guarding this gap. Large numbers of Italian troops are gathered in Kor√ß√´, Albania, to peer into Florina, but there has been no major progress. There is also a gap in the central front, which can lead to the rugged countryside of Greece. Even if the invading troops get this place, there will be no strategic benefit. There is another gap near the coast, between the mountains and the sea. Athens is now beginning to receive stories of the Greek army's glorious battles, such as three companies of the Greek army blocking the invasion of an entire Italian Alpine division in the mountains for many hours, and half a company of the Greek army using the terrain to defeat two companies of the Italian army. (Reuters dispatch from the 1st)

Athens - The Greek High Command announced today that the Greek defense forces in the mountainous Greek-Albanian border area in the west launched a brave counterattack yesterday, supplemented by heavy shelling from Greek naval ships at sea, and finally drove back the main Italian force that was heading towards Yannina, an important supply center along the west coast. It is said that the Greek army recovered a strategically important mountain village on the border during the counterattack. It is also said that the Italian army, which was advancing in a pincer formation along the border, retreated after bleeding from heavy bombardment by Greek army and navy artillery and from steep dive bombings and machine-gun strafing by the Greek air force. The Greek army's sea and air attacks have moved the battlefield to Albanian territory. Countless Greek army shells and bombs have fallen on Italian army outposts. The Greek army's report continued that while the three forces of the army, navy, and air force were jointly preventing the Italian army in the west from advancing, the Greek mountain troops, aided by heavy rain, turned mountain passes into swamps, and were also able to prevent the second Italian army force pushing towards Florina and Thessaloniki. After four days of fighting, the Italian army, which had gained less than twelve miles in the north, reportedly sent planes deep into Greek territory to bomb late last night, killing many civilians. The Greek High Command said that in the undeclared war, Greece's greatest victory over Italy was achieved in northern Yannina, thirty miles from the Greek-Albanian border. Greek soldiers in skirts braved the risk of artillery fire and machine guns, advanced towards the Kamas Valley overlooking Yannina, and captured it by storm. After several hours of hand-to-hand combat, the Greek army defeated the Italian army on this mountain, seizing a large number of military weapons, ammunition, and supplies. (International News Agency dispatch from the 1st)

Ohrid - Today there are many tug-of-war battles along the Greek-Albanian border. It is reported that the Italian army, under the cover of artillery, advanced seven kilometers deep into Greek territory along the highway from Belvuno (Albania) to Yannina (Greece), but encountered stubborn resistance from the Greek army. It is said that 13 Italian soldiers were killed and 60 were injured, while 20 Greek soldiers were killed and 40 were injured. Italian troops in other parts of the border have captured several small towns, but the fierce offensives of Italian troops in several places have been fiercely repelled by the Greek army. At dawn today, Italian troops occupied the village of Kasnani, several kilometers south of Konispoli. The Italian column advancing to Meriso Pida (a small town on the Yamina highway) was repelled by the Greek army. It is heard that the war on the entire Greek-Albanian border was greatly affected by the bad weather on Wednesday night and Thursday morning. The sound of giant cannons thundered along the Yugoslav border, coming from the Albanian border village of Biliqida, and was clearly audible here. The main force of the Italian army attacking Greece is reportedly concentrated near Mesari (a small town in Albania). From here, the Italian army advanced along the Yannina Avenue, invaded Greek territory, and captured a bridge over the Viosa River, but was severely attacked by the Greek artillery there. After an hour, the Italian army's advance was frustrated. In this battle, 17 Italian soldiers were killed and 40 were injured, while 4 Greek soldiers were killed. (United Press dispatch from the 1st)

Rome - Since last night, the Italian army has adopted a pincer formation to attack Yannina in separate routes, and is currently meeting there (Yannina is the closest important town to the Albanian border in Greece). A column of Italian troops composed of Alpine troops and Albanian teams has set out from the Albanian border town of Billa and is advancing to the southeast for encirclement. Another column set out from the vicinity of Konispoli on the border and went straight to Yannina. This news came from Jinokasdros, the southernmost tip of Albania. According to reports, the column that set out from Pila last night has advanced to ten miles from Yannina, and the column from Konis is also no more than five miles from its destination. It is widely believed that these two teams will occupy Yannina today, and well-informed sources have denied the claim that Yannina was captured last night. Another Italian column attacked Bolina in northern Greece last night, and Italian aircraft strafed the Greek artillery there to assist. Many Italian newspapers here claim that although the enemy's artillery fire is fierce and the resistance is fierce, the progress of the Italian army cannot be stopped. However, in the past forty-eight hours, the Great Earl has been pouring rain, and the original war zone, except for the barren mountains, has now become a swamp. Regarding the claim of Italian truce, well-informed sources in Italy refused to discuss it, but said that regardless of whether Greece resists or not, the Italian advance will continue unabated. Italy will not consider any negotiations unless King George II of Greece and Prime Minister Metaxas express their surrender. (United Press dispatch from the 1st)

### Greek Air Force Sorties for the First Time: Italian Rear Supply Stations Bombed

Yesterday marked the first reports of Greek light bombers engaged in combat, striking Italian army units and various supply stations behind Italian lines outside Malsani, and bombing other Italian army units advancing along the coastal routes. The main objective of the Greek light bombers was clearly to assault the Italian army advancing on Govmeniti, as Govmeniti serves as the terminus of the route through the Kmas Valley, which leads to Yannina, in the direction of the Ionian Sea. Furthermore, according to various dispatches arriving here from Thessaloniki yesterday, Greek forces are presently holding the lines. These dispatches went on to note that although this forward news did not detail the combat specifics, it has rendered the general Thessaloniki populace rather optimistic. A blackout is currently in effect every night throughout all of northern Greece, though sources state that other activities continue as usual. (United Press dispatch from the 1st)

### Nearby Government Island Warships Bombard Reinforcements of the Righteous Army

Government Island: Starting from 7:00 AM yesterday, Greek warships participated in the battle against the Italian army, continuously bombarding a forward position of the Italian army on the Greek-Albanian border for one hour. Many spectators watched the battle along the coast of Government Island. During the Greek warships' bombardment, no Italian warships or aircraft were seen on the scene, and there were no reports of naval battles between Britain and Italy. (Reuters dispatch from the 1st)

Athens: An official statement claimed that Greek warships on Government Island bombarded the Italian army for one hour to prevent the Italian army from advancing through Konispolis along the coast towards Ioannina. The counterattack by the Turkish army immediately followed. It is widely believed that many shells landed in the port of Saranda, where seven ships of Italian reinforcements landed in southern Albania. The intensity of the Greek bombardment shook the houses on Government Island. The Greek High Command stated that Italian supply trains and mechanized units were heavily damaged by the bombing. During the bombing, no Italian warships or aircraft appeared to resist. (Dispatch from International News Service on the 1st)

### Italy Fails to Conquer Greece on Two Routes, Using Three Different Military Forces

Athens: The battle on the Greek-Albanian border on Thursday can be considered completely satisfactory from the Greek standpoint because not only were the Italian army's repeated attempts to attack decisively defeated without any gains, but also the Greek army's counterattacks were able to advance everywhere without difficulty. In its unsuccessful efforts, the Italian side used three different military forces. The first was a light tank fleet, which attacked in the western border area, i.e., the coastal area. However, the road it wanted to take was narrow and rugged, and the team could not spread out, so it had no effect. The second was a cavalry unit, which attempted to cross the river in the coastal area to reach the starting point of the Greek main defense line, but it also failed and suffered heavy casualties. The third was an irregular Albanian army, led by Italian officers, which was eventually driven back. The Greek army captured several Italian soldiers. Fresh troops have arrived to take over the defense behind the main Greek line, which is an exciting development. (Reuters dispatch from the 1st)

London: According to Rome Radio, the Italian army's invasion of Greece was divided into two routes: (1) From the Argyrokastro area to Ioannina, 32 miles from the Albanian border; (2) From Kor√ß√´ to Florina. Despite the adverse weather and the roads being destroyed by the retreating Greek army, the Italian army continues to advance without letting up. From the current situation, the Greek army's actions seem to be defensive in nature. (Reuters dispatch from the 1st)

New York: The New York Herald Tribune reported a Washington dispatch stating that, according to reliable French sources, President Roosevelt's recent telegram to Marshal P√©tain was worded quite sternly, stating that he would take all measures to eliminate any threat of changing the sovereignty of French territories in the Western Hemisphere.

### Italian Army Digs Trenches to Fortify Positions Along the Kalamas River

Rome: News last night indicated that the Italian army invading Greece is currently digging trenches to fortify its positions along the Kalamas River. This move proves that the Axis powers are now attempting to quickly conquer Greece without a bloody battle. Italian Foreign Minister Ciano arrived in Tirana yesterday, presumably to guide the Fascists in settling the Greek issue and to plan to drive the British from the Aegean and Ionian Seas in the eastern Mediterranean. Military reports from here state that the Italian army is consolidating its positions in the Kalamas area, presumably to prepare for a major offensive and to occupy the Ionian industrial area in northwestern Greece. According to official reports, Italian columns, under the cover of aircraft and heavy artillery, advanced from the west coast to the right bank of the Kalamas River, where they are not far from Ionia. (Dispatch from International News Service on the 1st)

### Slow Progress of Italian Army Invading Greece Blamed on Unfavorable Weather and Terrain

Rome: The Italian army's slow progress on the Greek border is blamed by Italian apologists on unfavorable weather. According to the Stefani News Agency, a reporter accompanying the Italian army said that the weather in Albania is exceptionally bad, with continuous rain and muddy ground everywhere, making it difficult for personnel, horses, and mechanized units to trudge forward. (Dispatch from Reuters on the 1st)

London: Rome Radio also offered an explanation for the Italian army's slow progress in Greece, claiming that it was because Italy still hoped that the Greek government would repent in time and change its rash actions, and because mountain warfare requires slow and steady progress, minimizing casualties and losses before launching a sweeping attack. (Reuters dispatch from the 1st)

### Second Air Raid Alert in Athens, Anti-Aircraft Fire as Dense as a String of Pearls

Athens: The first air raid occurred here today. The first alert occurred at 10:40 AM and was lifted after half an hour. Five Italian aircraft were seen circling over the western district, and anti-aircraft guns fired at them. There was another alert at 11:30 AM, but it is unknown whether any bombs fell. (Reuters dispatch from the 1st)

### Italian Aircraft Viciously Attack Patras, Over One Hundred Innocent Civilians Killed

Athens: Over a hundred civilians were killed by bombs in the Greek port of Patras on Sunday. It was recently attacked again by Italian aircraft. According to a public security report, eight enemy aircraft attacked yesterday, and some houses in the port of Patras were damaged, but only one person was injured. After the port was bombed on Sunday, 110 bodies were recovered, including one pastor, one police officer, 30 women, and 45 children. Italian aircraft dropped over 200 bombs on Patras, destroying many buildings, but they were not military targets. (Reuters dispatch from the 1st)

Athens: Italian aircraft penetrated deep into Greek territory throughout the day. Their purpose was clearly to disrupt the Greek army's rear and split the Greek army's lines. The ports of Patras and Lepanto, the town of Nafpaktos, and an island in the Aegean Sea off the coast of Piraeus were all bombed again. After the air raid on Patras on Monday, most of its residents had withdrawn, and the people of Lepanto and Nafpaktos had also received government orders to evacuate. There was a new alert in the ancient city of Athens last night, and all the lights in the city were immediately turned off, creating a dark world. Only the white columns of the reconstructed Roman-era theater shone eerily in the moonlight, making this ancient capital a target for bombs. However, Athens was spared the devastation of air raids last night. (Note: Greek Prime Minister General Metaxas had declared Athens a "non-defended city" to avoid air raids.) Residents of Athens, who took refuge in cellars and the few air-raid shelters that the government could set up in time, heard anti-aircraft fire, but Italian aircraft did not fly to Athens. After the alert was lifted, military sources revealed that several Italian aircraft had approached Athens. According to reports, the Italian aircraft were bombing an island where British sailors had landed. Later, it was reported that the Italian aircraft had attacked the British army. As for the name of the island where the British army had landed, the Greek High Command kept it secret. (Dispatch from International News Service on the 1st)

Neutral observers are quite concerned about the danger of the Italian-Greek war spreading. (Reuters dispatch from the 1st)

Istanbul: Turkish Defense Minister Ali Rƒ±fkƒ± warned Bulgaria yesterday that the Turkish army has made all necessary preparations for action when necessary.

News has spread that Bulgaria has reinforced troops in the Greek-Turkish border area. Political circles here believe that the rumored military action is a prelude to Bulgaria's participation in the Balkan war. Bulgaria intends to seize the Greek and Turkish parts of Thrace and the Thracian port of Dedeaƒüa√ß. Political circles here fear that Germany will provide assistance to Bulgaria in its actions in the Balkans. (Dispatch from International News Service on the 1st)

Berlin: Regarding foreign rumors that Germany had issued an ultimatum to Turkey, it was denied here yesterday, calling it groundless. According to information received here, Turkey remains neutral. According to political observers here, none of the countries surrounding the Italian-Greek war show any signs of mobilizing troops. When asked whether the Italian-Greek relationship would affect German-Greek relations, it was said that in accordance with the conditions of German-Italian unity, the German government has decided to review the issue of its relationship with Greece.

### Regarding the Future of France, Germany and Italy Reach Important Decisions; Hitler Will Announce These Decisions Soon; Laval Goes to Paris to Continue Negotiations with Germany

Zurich: A news agency controlled by the Italian side reported that diplomatic circles believe that Hitler and Mussolini reached very important decisions regarding France during their meeting in Florence.

Vichy: French Deputy Prime Minister Laval, after meeting with German authorities in Paris, returned here yesterday. He will meet with Marshal P√©tain and go to Paris again to continue negotiations. (Dispatch from Havas News Agency on the 1st)

### Laval Speaks in Paris, Discussing Cooperation with Germany in the Long Term

Paris: Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval met with reporters at the Matignon Palace (the official residence of former prime ministers) here today and gave a speech explaining that his visit to negotiate with the German authorities focused on the practical ways of cooperation between the two countries, especially on colonial and economic issues. His speech stated, "France and Germany are negotiating on various issues related to the interests of both parties, but an agreement can only be reached after careful consideration. Our country has suffered great losses after adventurous warfare, and the work of reconstruction cannot be accomplished in a few days or weeks. We must know that as long as military actions do not stop, various difficulties will exist, and reconstruction work cannot begin. Fortunately, both France and Germany have raised concrete issues, and answers will be found in the coming days. Regarding this matter, Marshal P√©tain gave a radio address in Lyon last night, emphasizing the importance of his meeting with German leader Hitler and saying that "France and Germany must cooperate sincerely and must not have any aggressive thoughts." Following this principle, I continued negotiations with German military and political authorities here today. This is the natural result of Marshal P√©tain's historic meeting with leader Hitler in Montoire. The policies we are now pursuing are sufficient to enable our country to achieve recovery. This is not only beneficial to France but also to Europe. In short, France and Germany have studied how to cooperate effectively in all aspects, especially on economic and colonial issues, to seek welfare for both countries and for the whole of Europe. Both sides are establishing contact in an environment of mutual understanding. Germany is treating us with great courtesy, which is a rare encounter for a defeated country. Marshal P√©tain and government authorities know that this matter is of great importance and are now working together to find solutions. The nature and scope of our efforts will soon be clear to the people of the country, and they can also judge whether they are right or wrong. As for me personally, I was privileged to be at the end of the table when Marshal P√©tain and Hitler met, and the impression at that time will never be forgotten. Since the beginning of history, the two great nations of France and Germany have repeatedly clashed, but I have personally witnessed that after Marshal P√©tain and Hitler met, I knew that these two great nations had other ways to resolve their disputes besides war. From then on, France will be able to clearly understand how to protect itself to resist foreign forces and be fully responsible for its actions in a spirit of freedom. It is a pity that we failed to plan for self-preservation earlier, and only after being defeated did we make plans for recovery. It is painful to say. But French history has also achieved victories in the past, and this time it can abandon military force and cultivate culture, using peaceful ideals to enlighten our youth."

### French Government Assures the United States That Territories in the Western Hemisphere Will Not Be Ceded

Washington: French Ambassador to the United States Henri-Haye assured the U.S. State Department yesterday that the United States need not worry about French territories in the Western Hemisphere being affected by the situation. After meeting with Assistant Secretary of State Sumner Welles, the French ambassador told reporters that he had stated that the negotiations between France, Germany, and Italy did not involve ceding territory or making a separate peace with Germany. He received a telegram from Vichy on Wednesday night, and he believes that France has put forward the idea of a formal peace in the negotiations. As for President Roosevelt's message to Marshal P√©tain regarding French territories in the Western Hemisphere, Marshal P√©tain has not yet replied to the United States. (Reuters dispatch from the 1st)

### The Delicate Relationship Between Germany and Greece

Athens: Yesterday, telephone communication between Athens and Berlin was interrupted, for reasons unknown. Although the relationship between Germany and Greece is clearly in a delicate state, a spokesman for the German embassy here said that German-Greek relations are "good but not absolutely so." "Germany has not had any friction with Greece." The Greek government and police are now working hard to prevent any incidents from causing friction between Germany and Greece. A Greek Foreign Ministry spokesman told a United Press reporter yesterday that rumors of peace negotiations between Italy and Greece are absurd. The Greek army is currently defending all front lines, and Britain has also given Greece all possible assistance. Although it is widely rumored in the capitals of other Balkan countries that Greece will engage in peace talks if British and Turkish aid to Greece does not arrive, people here believe that this statement by the Greek Foreign Ministry spokesman indicates that Greece will continue to resist.

### Former British Cabinet Member Discusses the Mediterranean War Situation: The British Fleet Should Take Swift Action to Deal Italy a Heavy Blow

London: Former Minister for Coordination of Defense Lord Chatfield expressed his views on the British Broadcasting Corporation last night, saying that Britain should deal Italy a heavy blow at this time. Britain has a fleet in the Mediterranean that is strong enough to contain the Italian fleet, guard the Strait of Gibraltar, and defend the Suez Canal. As Italy advances on Greece through Albania, it can only maintain the supply of its army through a short sea route across the Adriatic Sea. Although the Adriatic Sea is not easy for the British Navy to enter, British ships have the possibility of operating at night. If Italy wants to expand its war to the Greek islands, the British fleet will get the opportunity it expects. Military tactics focus on attacking the enemy's weak points with our strong forces. Italy is the weak link in the Axis. If Britain now divides its naval and air forces, which are defending Britain against Germany, to attack Italy, it will be able to deal Italy a heavy blow. The British fleet's fulfillment of its responsibility to guarantee Greece will have a great impact. The Greek Navy consists of one cruiser, 23 torpedo boats, and six submarines. They will definitely be able to perform alongside the British fleet. Italy's goal is to divide British forces and weaken the defenses within Egypt. However, naval and air support to Greece is more valuable than sending a large army to Thessaloniki and having the trouble of transporting and supplying them. Greek territorial waters are now a new battlefield for Britain. With Greece's consent, the British Navy has been operating in Greek territorial waters for many years, and its ports and islands all have valuable military points. These are all well-known to the British Navy and can be used by them. We must also know that bases cannot be used as easily and quickly as they were in the past. First, they must have equipment to defend against air raids and submarine attacks. However, Italy's war against Greece has only just begun, so it is not yet time to talk about this. (Reuters dispatch from the 1st)

### British Naval Activity in Gibraltar

### Italian and Greek Envoys Will Both Lower Flags and Return Home

Berlin: A dispatch from Rome states that the Greek ambassador to Italy, Politis, has applied for an exit visa and is arranging for Greek diplomats and consuls to leave Italy. It is expected that the Greek ambassador will not leave within days, as Greek consulates in various places need several days to complete their affairs. The Italian ambassador to Greece is also taking the same steps. (Reuters dispatch from the 1st)

Rome: Regarding the legal issues of the Italian-Greek war, well-informed sources here say that the severance of diplomatic relations between Italy and Greece due to the Greek ambassador to Italy applying for a passport does not legally create a state of war between the two countries, as neither country has formally declared war, and Italy has not notified other countries of this, so other countries have not formally declared neutrality. It is said that Greek Ambassador to Italy Politis has ordered all Greek consuls in Italy to gather in Rome so that they can leave Italy at the same time. At the same time, the Italian ambassador to Greece is also taking the same measures. (Dispatch from Havas News Agency on the 1st)

### After a Night of Tranquility, Italian Planes Join the Attack on England, Retaliating for the Bombing of Naples

London - After a peaceful night in London last night, German planes suddenly increased in number and launched a large-scale air raid this morning and at 3 pm this afternoon. Among the three squadrons of German planes were six heavy bombers. It is widely believed that these six planes belonged to Italy. Whether the Italian planes' participation in the attack on England was to retaliate for the bombing of Naples is not yet known. More than 40 German planes attacking London were intercepted by British fighter planes and eventually driven southwest. Therefore, the German planes did not drop bombs during the first air raid. During the second air raid, some planes penetrated the outskirts of London, causing damage to some houses. The third air raid involved 50 German planes, 20 of which entered London but were also driven away by British planes. (United Press International dispatch, 1st)

Rome - Italian officials have just acknowledged that Italian air force bombed Naples and its outskirts last night, killing one person and injuring five. The communique also stated that although the British planes bombed a wide area, including Bagnoli, Pordaca, Pomiigliano, and Duaico, the damage caused was minimal. (United Press International dispatch, 1st)

London - After the quietest night in months, German planes attacked again this morning, with one squadron arriving after another. The sound of alarms echoed the sound of bombs exploding in the suburbs. The usual German night raid began at 7 pm yesterday and lasted for two hours. Most London residents slept peacefully in air-raid shelters until six hours later, when new air-raid alarms sounded again. A few bombs fell on the outskirts of London, but none reached the inner defense lines. (International News Service dispatch, 1st)

Berlin - According to informed sources, several German dive bombers attacked an armory in southern England yesterday afternoon, scoring multiple hits and causing violent explosions. A train transporting heavy artillery shells and aircraft bombs was also hit and caught fire. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 1st)

Berlin - When German planes attacked a certain city on the southern coast of England yesterday, several storage depots near the station were hit and caught fire. Due to the strong sea breeze, the fire spread rapidly. A hangar and residences at an airfield in Birmingham were hit by bombs. Reconnaissance a few minutes later revealed that the largest hangar had been destroyed. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 1st)

London - A British Air Ministry communique stated that yesterday afternoon enemy planes individually attacked various parts of England, such as two cities in the east, as well as several locations in South Wales and the Midlands, with bombs falling. Casualties and material damage were slight. The air raid alarm in London last night sounded slightly earlier than in previous nights. London residents regarded the simultaneous sounds of bombs and artillery fire as normal. The buzzing sound of a few German planes was heard, flying very high. A few bombs were scattered in various areas. The all-clear signal last night was also earlier than usual, and there were no enemy planes disturbing the late night, so it was quite peaceful. Tram and other transportation services resumed as normal. (Reuters dispatch, 1st)

### British Air Force Night Raids on Channel Ports

London - The Air Ministry Information Office stated that on Wednesday night, the British Air Force carried out night raids on the German-occupied ports of Vlissingen (Netherlands), Antwerp and Ostend (Belgium), and Emden (Germany), dropping multiple tons of high-explosive bombs and hundreds of incendiary bombs. The attack on Vlissingen began at dusk and lasted for over an hour. Several batches of bombs fell on the Walcheren Canal and inner and outer harbors. Although clouds and smoke obscured the detailed results of the bombing, a large fire between two shipyards was clearly visible from 55 miles away. The port area of ‚Äã‚ÄãAntwerp was bombed, with explosions and fires breaking out. The targets in the port of Ostend, which had been attacked previously and subsequently repaired, were again bombed by large squadrons of Blenheim bombers. British planes found their targets easily, with bombs hitting piers and berths directly. Bombs exploded with a deafening roar, and fragments flew high into the air. In the attack on Emden, the pier was hit by bombs, which exploded and started a fierce fire that spread rapidly. Another plane attacked two nearby railway junctions, also causing large fires. (Reuters dispatch, 1st)

### US Army Department Permits Secret Weapons to Be Exported to England; Britain Obtains Bombing Sights, US Aircraft Production Gradually Increases

Washington - A senior official of the US Treasury Department told reporters last night that the US Army Department has approved the export to Britain of secret bombing sights manufactured and improved by the Sperry Gyroscope Company in New York. The Sperry factory is now contacting various manufacturers to mass-produce various parts of this long-awaited weapon. The official revealed that this bombing sight, which makes American bombing the most accurate in the world, is scheduled to begin overseas shipments by the end of February or early March next year. He also said that the manufacturing of the bombing sight has so far been limited to the use of experimental models, and only a few have been used for trials during exercises and training of pilots. This American invention is the culmination of the efforts of more than 50 companies, so its accuracy is not difficult to imagine. The Treasury official stated that if the Royal Air Force applies this bombing sight, it will have a great advantage when attacking jumping-off points for invasion of England and industrial centers in German-occupied Europe. Last night, the US Army Military Intelligence Department refused to confirm or comment on the government's approval of the export of the Sperry model to Britain. US Air Force generals said that they "are not allowed to discuss this bombing sight, so they cannot discuss it." Rumors that this bombing sight has been shipped to England to help in combat have recently been widespread in Washington, but military leaders have denied it. (International dispatch, 1st)

Washington - It is estimated that the United States is currently supplying Britain with 250 to 300 aircraft per month, and is making every effort to increase production. This number should gradually increase. President Roosevelt's comments in Boston on Friday night, which involved Britain's request to purchase more aircraft, referred to a plan discussed by the British Purchasing Commission and the US Treasury Department several weeks ago. At that time, the British Purchasing Commission asked if the United States could manufacture 3,000 aircraft per month for Britain. After investigation, it was deemed difficult to do so. Manufacturing 3,000 aircraft per month would require the establishment of 40 new factories. An estimate of manufacturing approximately 1,300 aircraft per month was then proposed. Britain then issued an order to build a total of 12,000 fighters and bombers. However, no one can say when the monthly production of 1,200 aircraft can be achieved. American aircraft manufacturers have two major difficulties: it is not easy to expand the production of components and engines. According to opinions from well-informed sources in the United States, the United States may cede the aircraft that it has ordered for its own use to Britain. (Reuters dispatch, 1st)

### Willkie Attacks Pro-Soviet Policy in Campaign Speech

Washington - Roosevelt departed from Washington last night to continue his campaign speeches and activities. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 1st)

Baltimore - Republican presidential candidate Willkie said in a speech here yesterday that he advocates maintaining peace in the Western Hemisphere, but does not approve of appeasement policies. Although Roosevelt said that totalitarian countries should be quarantined, the Roosevelt administration is adopting a policy of appeasement towards them and assisting them, such as the recent permission to transport machinery to the Soviet Union, which is one example. The Soviet Union is an ally of Germany. Is this a way to defend ourselves? If he is elected, he will never help mechanize the Red Army to avoid helping it achieve its goals. He should make it his mission to mechanize the US Army, because appeasement is the quickest path to war. (Reuters dispatch, 1st)

### Indian Leader Nehru Arrested, Met with Gandhi Before Arrest, Appointed Leader of New Non-Cooperation Movement

Gabor - According to a report from Delhi Radio, Nehru, leader of the Indian National Congress and former President of the All-India Congress, was arrested by the British authorities in Allahabad last night after meeting with Gandhi. When the All-India Congress Executive Committee recently met in Wardha, Gandhi nominated Nehru and Vinoba as leaders of the new non-cooperation movement. Vinoba was arrested by the British side a few days after the decision to implement the non-cooperation movement. The British authorities in India hope that the arrest of Indian leaders will temporarily quell the non-cooperation movement. The British side now feels the pressure exerted by the Indian National Congress, so to prevent trouble before it happens, the British side will use force when necessary. According to indirect sources in Delhi, Indians are extremely indignant about the arrest of Nehru, and believe that Britain is openly waging war against India. Although the Indian National Congress will not take any retaliatory measures for the time being, it has already taken preventive measures. This is Nehru's fourth arrest. The first time was in April 1930, for violating the Salt Law, and he was sentenced to two years in prison, but he was released in March 1931 by the agreement between Gandhi and the Indian Governor-General. He was imprisoned for the second time in February 1932 for advocating the non-cooperation movement, with a sentence of two years, but he was released after 18 months. In January 1938, Nehru served as the President of the All-India Congress for nine consecutive years. He declined the election and his successor, Bose, was also arrested several times. Nehru is a member of a prominent family in India and enjoys high prestige in India. He has a very close relationship with Gandhi. Nehru recently visited Chongqing and met with Chinese leaders. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 1st)

Bombay - Since the former President of the All-India Congress, Nehru, was arrested yesterday in Allahabad, all markets here have informally ceased trading. Gandhi had selected Nehru and another person to deliver anti-war speeches as part of the Congress's implementation of a limited civil disobedience plan. Another Gandhi-faction leader was arrested a few days ago after delivering several speeches. (Reuters dispatch, 1st)

### Tokyo Nichinichi Shimbun Criticizes US Military Buildup Policy, Pointing Out that US Is Using Manila as a Base, Actively Preparing for War Against Japan

Tokyo - Today's Tokyo Nichinichi Shimbun has a special dispatch from Shanghai, stating that as a result of Washington's empty threats, the United States is gradually moving into the dangerous area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Far East, etc. This thunderbolt published on the front page has attracted much attention. It says that the political, diplomatic, military, and economic plans adopted by the United States in the Far East have now crossed the stage of intimidation and are advancing directly towards war. The US military buildup policy can be seen in the following measures: (1) The withdrawal of American expatriates from the Far East. This move can be seen as a prelude to the United States completely banning trade with Japan. (2) Preparations for the withdrawal of the 4th Marine Regiment stationed in Shanghai. At the same time, these Marines are also undergoing active training, and the transport ship USS Gold Star is waiting in Shanghai. (3) The US$25 million loan to China by the Export-Import Bank. This loan allows Chongqing to pay for its purchases of armaments from the Soviet Union, and allows the Soviet Union to use this soft currency to purchase machinery from the United States. The United States' move aims to recruit the Soviet Union to join the Anglo-American bloc. (4) An attempt is being made to establish an advanced base for attacking Japan in Manila. A large batch of armaments originally destined for Chongqing is stored there. It is widely believed that these military supplies are nominally transported to Chongqing but are actually shipped to the Philippines to strengthen its defenses. The Philippines now has 150 to 170 Boeing bombers, which can fly from Manila to Tokyo to carry out air raids. There are also several squadrons of fighter planes that have also been returned to the Philippines by the United States. (5) The United States joined Britain in undermining the talks between Japan and the Dutch East Indies authorities in Batavia. At the same time, the US Ambassador to China, Johnson, has attempted to conclude a Sino-Soviet alliance. When Foreign Ministry spokesman Suma received news reporters, an American reporter asked about the above news. Suma asked, "Do you believe it?" The reporter replied, "No." Suma then said, "I don't believe it either." The Japanese government should remain calm at this juncture and not be incited by alarming newspaper reports.

Tokyo - "Hochi Shimbun" warned today that, regarding future negotiations with the Soviet Union, "one should not be overly optimistic." The newspaper, which had previously strongly advocated that Japan and the Soviet Union sign a non-aggression treaty, said that the Soviet Union is currently pursuing its policy of opportunity, standing between totalitarian countries and democratic countries. According to the newspaper, Britain, the United States, and Chongqing are currently conducting insidious negotiations in an attempt to alienate relations between Japan and the Soviet Union. Chongqing sent Sun Fo, President of the Legislative Yuan, to Moscow in an attempt to undermine relations between Japan and the Soviet Union. (United Press International dispatch, 1st)

A Painful History of the European War (1)

### The Beginning and End of the Anglo-French Split

But to make the troops of the two countries friendly is certainly not easy. Language barrier is the biggest obstacle. But given the opportunity, the two sides can also work together in harmony. Sharp anti-British movements were found in the ruling class, but do not exist among the people.

According to many Frenchmen, Britain's combat prestige is maintained by its navy and air force. The two battles of the German pocket cruiser Admiral Graf Spee and the transport ship Altmark, and the Battle of Narvik had a significant impact on the French side. Even the most anti-British Frenchmen, hearing this news, nodded in appreciation and said: "The British are really not weak!"

The British Air Force was most popular in France. At the beginning of the war, there were only a handful of French planes. The glorious achievements of the British Air Force greatly boosted French morale. When British Hurricane fighters attacked enemy Heinkel or Dornier aircraft, eight machine guns fired simultaneously, shooting down enemy aircraft, and French soldiers were all beaming and applauding. French experts praised the British planes, such as the earlier Hurricane, Spitfire, and later Defiant fighters, and the Blenheim and Wellington bombers. The pilots were skilled and were the best of their time, and the combination of man and machine complemented each other.

One day, I met a young pilot, who was only nineteen years old, but had shot down several German planes. I asked him, "Is it difficult to shoot down German planes?" He replied very well: "Difficult? No, not at all difficult. Just strictly follow the teachings of the aviation school. They taught me how to pursue enemy planes, ignoring the enemy's fire net, until the enemy and I were about 300 yards apart, and the enemy plane appeared right in the center of the small red circle on the windshield. At this time, just press the lightning button that controls eight machine guns, and you will be able to shoot down the German plane. I followed these teachings, and at 300 yards, I saw the enemy plane right in the center of my sight, and when I pressed the lightning button, I really got what I wanted. You see, this thing is really not difficult at all."

However, although the British planes and pilots were impeccable, the organization of the British Air Force was too complicated. There were some planes on the northern battlefield, formed into "Air Force Detachment 1," commanded by General Gort. In Champagne, there was another "Forward Detachment," mostly composed of bombers. In addition, a large number of aircraft remained in Britain to defend factories and villages.

The fighter plane can only fly in the air for an hour and a half, so its stationing in various parts of Britain is due to this.

In the Battle of Flanders, the Allied forces were defeated, and the two countries blamed each other and attacked each other. They were not lacking in courage, and there were indeed many teams among the British and French armies worthy of praise. The reasons for the setback should be sought elsewhere.

The British side said: "Our army has been surrounded and has lost all its baggage and equipment. This is due to strategic mistakes, but not to our army's past."

The French side said: "Our army certainly has its mistakes, and we do not deny it, but the biggest problem is the lack of troops, and Britain should bear most of the responsibility for this."

After the breakthrough at Sedan, Churchill initially tried to mitigate its seriousness. On May 15, Churchill flew to Paris and held a meeting with the highest French military and political authorities. He had extraordinary decisiveness, and the French authorities were amazed and admired him, and regained their courage. Those who met him that day were all impressed by his lion-like roar and his eloquent eloquence. He opposed withdrawing from Belgium, and he opposed abandoning Leuven and Brussels. He wanted to use a counterattack to attack the enemy's offensive.

On May 26, Reynaud flew to London for a meeting. The news he brought was inevitably discouraging. He said that if Britain could not provide large-scale assistance, France would have no choice but to cease fighting. The two-day air force provided little help to the war in France. Although they participated in the Battle of Dunkirk, it was because it was only separated from the British coast by a narrow strip of water. They flew from their British base to France in half an hour, fought for half an hour, and flew back to their country in the remaining half hour. Because there was plenty of time, the results were excellent. As the war moved south, this tactic gradually failed. The number of British aircraft participating in the Battle of Flanders decreased day by day, and the French military became increasingly dissatisfied. After that, on May 28, Belgium suddenly surrendered to Germany, and the British and French Allied forces had to retreat hastily to Dunkirk.

After the Battle of Dunkirk, British public opinion was in an uproar. Some news reporters even said: "We must never send the divisions that were rescued at great sacrifice back to France again. The French military situation is on the verge of collapse. Even if reinforcements are sent, it will be impossible to save it. These divisions must remain in the country and coexist with Britain." Even those with more generous minds insisted that the troops had suffered heavy losses and could not reorganize for three months.

By the time of the Battle of the Somme, what British troops were left in France? The 51st Division, originally at Sarre, escaped the setback of the Battle of Flanders and later went to Saint-Val√©ry. In addition, there was only one division of motorized troops that was landing and a small part of the 3rd Division, that was all. Although the Canadian army had crossed the Channel, it arrived too late and withdrew before participating in the war. So when the Battle of France was in full swing, the German army numbered no less than 150 divisions, while the British army in the Battle of Maginot Line had only three or four divisions. In the eyes of informed people, that was the inevitable result of the great defeat in the Battle of Flanders.

German radio at the time also sarcastically criticized the British: "The British? The only tactic the British know is to board a ship and retreat. You will soon see them boast in their newspapers that the British Navy has won a major victory and that the British army has retreated to the last man in good order without bloodshed!"

German propaganda soon proved to be true. British generals had lost confidence due to the defeat in the Battle of Flanders. They feared being surrounded and, due to instinct, only wanted to line up with their backs to the sea. The French commander also felt the uneasiness of the British army and was deeply afraid of affecting the overall situation. The period of sincere cooperation was now over.

In early June, the two armies seemed to be in a state of confusion, and I had to do my best to make my superiors pay attention. At this time, I was sent to England, not to beg for help from the well-informed British government, but to try to urge the British people to pay attention to the perilous situation in France, and to explain to them that in order to save France from desperation, Britain must put its own safety aside and send its last plane and last battalion of soldiers to France for reinforcements in order to succeed.

Education News

### Jiangsu Education Department Report on Shanghai: Overview of Secondary Education Under Provincial Jurisdiction (Part 1): Explaining Difficult Environment and the Difficulty of Resuming Classes; Administrative Handling and Examination Methods

(Dahua News Agency, Northern Jiangsu Dispatch) A report issued by the Jiangsu Education Department stated: The environment in Shanghai is different, administration cannot be conducted openly, and schools are restricted by the authorities in the concessions, resulting in all education and instruction not being able to proceed according to normal practices. Under these circumstances, it would seem appropriate to withdraw entirely and move inland. However, there are no fewer than 100,000 young people in Shanghai who come from occupied areas. If they are not given assistance, it would not be permitted by the policy of resisting aggression and building the nation. Therefore, it is necessary for public and private secondary schools from various provinces to decide to relocate to Shanghai to resume classes, which is also the reason for the establishment of the Shanghai Office. In order to provide colleagues in the education sector of Northern Jiangsu with a clear understanding of the general situation of secondary education under provincial jurisdiction in Shanghai, a brief report is specially made as follows:

(1) Current Status

(1) Schools that have already resumed classes in Shanghai include: 7 provincial middle schools, 4 provincial normal schools, 3 provincial vocational schools, 3 county middle schools, 20 private middle schools, 1 private normal school, and 1 private vocational school, totaling 39 schools. (2) The total annual expenditure is approximately 1.2 million yuan, with students bearing 85%, subsidies accounting for an estimated 9%, temporary provincial subsidies accounting for 1%, and private subsidies accounting for 5%. (3) The total number of students is over 10,000 (33 schools), with provincial schools having more than 7,000 students and private schools having more than 3,000. The annual number of graduates from senior and junior high schools is 1,300. The total number of faculty and staff is 855 (33 schools), with 494 in provincial schools and 361 in private schools. One-third are part-time. In terms of compensation, the hourly rate for provincial middle schools is 1.11 yuan for senior high and 0.83 yuan for junior high, while private schools offer 0.86 yuan for senior high and 0.66 yuan for junior high.

(2) Administrative Handling

(1) Method for Verifying Academic Records: In accordance with the standards set by the Department, taking into account the facts of Shanghai, principles are formulated, and personnel are dispatched to inspect each school separately. Problems are listed as they arise, and proposed solutions are drafted, which are left with the school principal to handle separately and report back.

(2) Method for Supervising and Auditing Expenditures: At the beginning of each semester, schools are required to prepare a budget, ensuring that income and expenses are balanced and that there is no deficit. At the end of the semester, schools are required to prepare a final account, also ensuring that there is no overdraft. The principle is complete self-sufficiency. If unexpected events occur, remedies will be provided separately.

(3) Handling of Required Reports and Forms: At the beginning of each semester, the reports and forms submitted are limited to those stipulated in the regulations. Except for those that should be submitted to the Ministry, they are processed and filed separately for future reference. In the future, alternative methods will be formulated, whereby required reports and forms do not need to be submitted. The office will send personnel to inspect and stamp them at each school, and then return them to each school for safekeeping until the end of the emergency.

(4) Graduation Examination Method: It is inconvenient to hold a joint examination in Shanghai, so schools are only required to submit the list of graduates and the examination timetable in advance. Personnel will be sent to each school at the appointed time to conduct spot checks and monitor the examinations, as well as to investigate the number of participants and the examination questions for each subject. In the future, alternative methods will be formulated, and personnel will be sent to conduct spot checks on each grade level in the final semester.

(5) Method for Graduation Certificates and Seals: Because it is temporarily impossible to issue formal certificates, the method for issuing certificates in occupied areas promulgated by the Ministry is followed, and schools are instructed to issue graduation certificates with the office's steel seal affixed, to be exchanged for formal certificates after the end of the emergency.

(6) Joint Admission of Transfer Students to Grades 3 of Senior and Junior High Schools: There are nearly 200 public and private secondary schools in Shanghai, and students frequently transfer schools and skip grades, which is considered a common occurrence. As a result, academic standards are extremely uneven. In order to maintain the previous standards of graduates, provincial schools adhere to the principle of not admitting transfer students to Grade 3. If schools need to admit students to fill vacancies, they must organize a joint admissions committee to handle admissions in a unified manner, under the supervision of the office.

(7) Establishment and Registration of Private Schools: There is no shortage of enthusiastic educators in Shanghai, and there are also many faculty and students who have come to Shanghai from occupied areas who have not been able to find places. Therefore, this office does not take lightly the inspection during registration and the supervision after registration. All standards for registration are handled in accordance with the newly established standards.

(3) Past Struggles of Various Schools

(1) Difficulties in Resuming Schools: A. School Building Problems: Shanghai is densely populated and land is scarce, making it difficult to find school buildings. In addition to high rent, there is also a need for "transfer fees" (i.e., small rent), often amounting to thousands of yuan (Yangzhong's transfer fee was 6,000 yuan, and the private Jingzhong's transfer fee was 9,000 yuan, none of which can be recovered). Moreover, the school buildings found can only barely accommodate classes and are not practical. For example, the location is near the bustling city, the houses are small and crowded, and classrooms are used in shifts, all of which do not meet educational conditions. However, great effort has been expended. B. Fundraising: At the beginning of starting a school, most of the required funds are raised in advance by faculty and staff, with occasional private donations, but these are extremely rare. C. Summoning Faculty and Students: At the beginning of proposing to resume a school, most of the work is done by a small number of faculty and staff who run around and appeal, struggling hard. Most of the faculty and staff are recruited after the school is established. Almost all students hope that their alma mater will resume classes, but many are unable to come to Shanghai due to financial constraints and other reasons. Only one-third of those who can come to school actually do. D. Procedures for Resuming Classes in Concessions: Taking the French Concession as an example, (1) A board of directors is organized to submit to the Municipal Council for registration. (2) The board of directors applies for the establishment of the school. (3) The Municipal Council sends personnel to inspect the school building. If arrangements are not made in advance, problems will inevitably arise regarding light, ventilation, classroom area, and volume, and all previous efforts will be in vain. (4) Seek the consent of the four neighbors. If foreigners do not agree, special efforts must be made in advance to smooth things over. Otherwise, a letter of disagreement sent to the Municipal Council will also render all previous efforts in vain.

### Exchange Market Loosens; Gold Prices Plummet

Yesterday's spot gold grey market saw a sharp decline, pushing down to the 5,400 yuan mark, almost breaking through. The reason is that the exchange market was loose from morning to night, and there were rumors of bearish news, which flew in one after another. The high prices in the public bond market made operators slightly wary.

The price of jewelry gold in silver shops was lowered by 10 yuan in the end, and customs gold remained the same.

Before long, gold firms paid money to currency firms to rise by 10 yuan, 5,540 yuan. However, the rise in foreign exchange rates aroused a wave of selling from retail investors, and supply and demand gradually became uneven, and the price tended to fall. Securities firms sold 10 taels to silver firms, which had retreated to within 500 yuan, at 5,480 yuan. Then, another 20 taels were traded, reaching as high as 5,500 yuan. However, all kinds of bearish news blew in the market, and people's hearts were frustrated again. Gold firms sold vigorously, and silver firms dumped, causing the price to re-enter the 500 yuan mark. It is estimated that gold firms sold 10 taels to silver firms for 5,465 yuan. As a result, silver firms made a matching transaction of 20 taels for 5,475 yuan. Yesterday's afternoon closing price.

### Grains: Foreign Rice Arrives Daily, Yesterday 20,000 Bags, More to Come Tomorrow in Large Quantities

Foreign rice has been arriving in Shanghai in large quantities for several days. Details have been repeatedly noted in this column. It is now learned that yesterday, the Heinrich Jessen, a ship belonging to the manager of the Taikoo Company, arrived from Hong Kong with 9,801 bags, docking at the company's wharf in Pudong for unloading. Also, the Ewo Company's Yisheng arrived from Hong Kong with 9,476 bags, arriving in Shanghai yesterday afternoon and docking at the Roosevelt Wharf for unloading. The Guisheng arrived yesterday evening, reportedly also carrying more than 2,000 bags from Hong Kong, docking at the Roosevelt Wharf and unloading overnight. It is reported that a large quantity of foreign rice is being shipped directly from Saigon and is expected to arrive tomorrow.

Yesterday's foreign rice market saw a brief flurry of activity in the morning due to low prices and active sales. However, actual retailers have already begun selling at lower prices, making it difficult for retail sales to thrive, and appetite is not strong. Moreover, trading houses, anticipating the imminent arrival of large orders, are reluctant to buy enthusiastically. Furthermore, new orders are still being settled through exchange rate fluctuations. Yesterday, Jinfa sold 200 tons of Saigon rice at a price of 71.5 yuan. Although no major firms sold returned goods, smaller players continued to seek to offload. November shipments were priced at only 71 yuan, while cargo on the already arrived "Bird" ships was priced at 74.35 yuan, with approximately 300-400 tons changing hands. Due to sellers' reluctance to sell at a loss, the market saw a slight rise of 3-4 jiao. Overall, 6,000 bags were offered, with No. 1 new Saigon rice still priced at 67 or 66.5 yuan, No. 2 at 62.3 yuan or 61.6 yuan, machine-milled at 66 yuan to 64.3 yuan, No. 3 Siamese at 60 yuan or 59.5 yuan, small machine-milled at 60 yuan or 59 yuan, and Tokyo polished rice at 58.2 yuan.

New polished rice and kiln-grown wild rice arrivals suddenly became scarce, totaling only a little over 500 shi. Due to the tightness in foreign rice, retail sales on this street suddenly surged, creating a situation where supply could not meet demand. Sellers reacted with unusual briskness. The kiln-grown rice, with only 30-50 shi available on the open market, was particularly sought after, opening at 79 yuan, a sharp increase of 2-3 yuan compared to yesterday. Other new rice also rose by one yuan, opening at 78 yuan or 77.5 yuan per original bag, and 73.5 yuan or 72.5 yuan per dan. Wild rice arrivals and sales remained similar, without any gains or losses. Dujian rice, also in short supply, rose by half a yuan to nearly one yuan. Original bags of Yangjian rice opened at 69 yuan, original bags of Dujian rice at 69.5 yuan, and 67 yuan per dan. Broken rice had no market. Glutinous rice, due to slow outgoing traffic, and sellers‚Äô unwillingness to sell cheaply, resulted in a situation of no gains or losses.

### Foreign Flour Arriving Soon, Old "Car" Flour Finds No Buyer

Flour: Yesterday, the spot flour market weakened again because various mills increased their supply at lower prices, making the actual sales on this street more comfortable. In addition, because sales to customers have been quiet for a long time, and a large amount of foreign flour is expected to arrive soon, importers are not daring to purchase large quantities, causing the market to be listless and lifeless. The old "car" flour was priced at only 18.67 yuan, but still found no suitable buyer. High-grade foreign flour has reached the 19 yuan mark, but transactions are also rare. Only the export trade handled 2,000 bags of biscuit flour for the Green Army's ships yesterday at a price of 18.45 yuan, which is 5 fen less than the mill's listed price.

Wheat: Yesterday, the market was unusually stagnant. The arrival of new goods has been scarce recently, and Japanese mills have also been quiet for a long time. Except for a small amount of goods sent to the mills, there was virtually no market trading. It is reported that the Japanese mills are still paying 21 yuan for wheat collected from nearby Taicang and Pudong, while Chinese mills are not buying any. The market also lacked any significant fluctuations.

### Cotton Yarn: Morale is Low, Yarn Market Plummets, "Double Horse" Falls Below 1200 Yuan Again

The yarn market, which had risen the previous day, declined again yesterday, and the drop was severe. This is due to rampant rumors, coupled with already high base prices and a long period of rising prices. In general, speculators, recognizing that it is difficult to find an upward trend, have changed their minds and gone short. Therefore, recently in the market, morale has been leaning towards short-selling, and bullish news has not been strong enough to drive the market. At the same time, spot sales have stagnated, and the momentum for further price increases is especially lacking. The price of 20-count "Double Horse" yarn has fallen below the low price of the previous day. Today, 1,245 bales of cotton yarn will be shipped to Hong Kong.

The opening mood in the spot yarn market this morning was slightly weaker, not as sharp as the previous day. The opening price of 20-count "Double Horse" yarn was 1,221 yuan, rising slightly to 1,229 yuan. Unexpectedly, as soon as the high price was seen, the bulls liquidated their positions. At the same time, exchange rates were lowered, and the market gradually fell to 1,205 yuan. Later in the market, rumors abounded, and the atmosphere of peace was strong. Spot sales were stagnant, and morale suddenly panicked. The market state changed rapidly, falling step by step, breaking the 1,200 yuan mark, with a price of 1,191 yuan. According to half-day transaction statistics, 3,735 bales were traded. The price of 60-count "Double Horse" yarn fell by 28 yuan. The amounts bought by various parties are listed as follows:

Hong Kong: 335, Peers: 3,400

Total: 3,735

### Cotton Market Quiet but Still Stable

The spot cotton market still lacks improvement. Mills are not interested, and merchants are also unwilling to act. Therefore, the cotton market is still sluggish, but morale is still stable. North Taicang cotton is priced at 229 yuan, and Heti cotton at 210 yuan, both of which are warehouse delivery prices.

In other news, in the foreign cotton market, New York cotton prices rose initially due to speculative buying. Then, due to continued gains in Wall Street stock prices and buying by some Japanese merchants, the closing price was 5-6 points higher than the previous day. In India, yesterday's prices, including forecasts, rose by more than one rupee.

Transactions in Shanghai's foreign cotton market have been held back due to the instability of exchange rates. Everyone is taking a wait-and-see attitude. However, cotton prices have not softened due to the quiet market situation. Industry sentiment remains unusually high.

### Piece Goods: Eastern Cloth Sees Greater Decline

Mill Cloth: The market started flat and then weakened, affected by the fall in yarn prices. However, mills and large merchants are sticking to their prices. Merchants from Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangdong, and Hong Kong are still buying steadily. Therefore, prices for coarse cloth and twill have fallen by 2.5 jiao per piece, while prices for colored cloth and bleached cloth have fallen by 2.5 to 5 jiao. Velvet is holding steady. Transactions on this street totaled more than 300 pieces. Merchants from the Zhejiang route, including Wenzhou and Ningbo, bought 150-160 pieces of coarse cloth, basket cloth, and colored twill. Merchants from Fujian and Guangdong bought nearly 200 pieces of colored cloth and colored twill. Overseas, in places like Singapore, more than 4,000 pieces of colored cloth, bleached cloth, and bleached twill were purchased. Today, 750 pieces of piece goods will be shipped to Hong Kong.

Eastern Cloth: Yesterday, due to the sharp drop in raw yarn prices and the resurgence of rumors, speculators took advantage of the situation to sell, causing prices to fall step by step. Fine cloth fell by 1.2-1.3 yuan per piece, with 12-pound "Dragon Head" fine cloth closing at 35.5 yuan. Fine twill fell by 5-7.5 jiao per piece, and serge fell by 3 fen per yard. The closing price for "Four Gentlemen" was 1.1175 yuan. However, industry sentiment remains stable.

### Cashmere Overcoating Fabric: Seasonally Popular and Rising, Trend for Overcoating Fabric Increasingly Tight

Due to the colder weather, actual sales have increased. Existing stocks are limited, and most of the incoming goods have been sold. The market for Cashmere overcoating fabric is even more popular. Standard prices have risen by another 5-6 yuan. Due to the thin market stock and the extreme shortage of incoming goods, combined with its light and soft texture, and the prevalence of black and gray colors, customers mostly specify this fabric, creating a situation where demand exceeds supply, and it is popular throughout Shanghai. Yesterday, wholesale prices for large quantities were 85 yuan per yard, and retail prices were 90 yuan. For stores that cut samples, the sample yard price requires a cut of over 100 yuan.

### Oil Cakes: Speculation in Edible Oil Resurges

Yesterday, peanut oil saw active speculation as merchants from Xiaogang came to purchase spot oil, and buying interest in futures oil was particularly high. Prices fluctuated up and down as buyers and sellers pushed and pulled, causing chaos in the market. In the end, due to the usual conditions in Qingdao, the closing price was only slightly changed compared to the previous day. Spot oil rose by 2 yuan, but soybean oil only saw a slight improvement, and the scope of transactions was narrow, with no significant changes overall. The number of transactions was 50 pieces of Jiaozhou soybean oil at a price of 75 yuan, and 200 dan of Daya Factory soybean oil at a price of 84.5 yuan. 300 pieces of Jiaozhou peanut oil were opened at a price of 70 yuan to 0.05 yuan, and 200 pieces for lower November delivery at a price of 72 yuan. 200 barrels of Qingdao oil were priced at 98 yuan or 97.75 yuan, and 350 barrels for lower November delivery were priced at 96.75 yuan to 98.5 yuan, closing at 98 yuan. 700 barrels for lower November delivery were priced at 98 yuan to 99.75 yuan, then falling to 98.5 yuan, and then rising to 99.75 yuan. 400 barrels for lower December delivery were priced at 99.5 yuan to 101 yuan, closing at 100.075 yuan. A total of 100 barrels for January delivery were priced at 100.075 yuan to 101 yuan. Today, another 250 cans of sesame oil and 200 bags of beans will be shipped to Hong Kong.

### Sugar Market: 3,000 Tons of Dutch Sugar Arrive

Yesterday in the sugar market, the public pricing remained at 71 yuan for Taikoo B mark, 65.5 yuan for HX mark East Warehouse, which is 5 jiao lower than the previous day, 55 yuan for Dutch red, followed by 54.3 yuan, and 5-7 jiao lower. 72 yuan was asked for 24 coarse white sugar, but no transactions occurred. Yesterday, 3,000 tons of sugar arrived from the Netherlands, and 8,080 bags of sugar arrived from Hong Kong.

### Coal: Newly Arrived Kailan Coal ‚Äî totaling more than 2,000 tons

Kailan coal, due to a long interruption in deliveries and a depletion of market inventory, saw steadily rising prices. Currently, Yitaixing has 2,000 tons of new coal, both lump and slack, for sale at wholesale prices. Kailan train lump is priced at 186 yuan per ton, and No. 1 slack is priced at 156 yuan. All of the above are prices for goods delivered from the warehouse. The price of handling and lightering are extra.

### Dried and Preserved Goods: Fresh Hawthorn Slices Available

The first batch of fresh hawthorn slices has arrived, totaling hundreds of pieces. Those with bright colors and dry bodies are sold for 50 yuan, and those of lower quality for 46 yuan. As this is the first time that the new crop has been offered, the market already feels tight.

### Green Cakes Debut

Green cakes, which are persimmon cakes, have arrived in the first batch of 50 pieces. The sellers are asking 40 yuan, and they are expected to be sold today. Later batches are expected to arrive in larger quantities, leading to a price drop. The number of arrivals is not large, only enough to meet the needs of this street.

### How to Use a Felt Hat

‚Äî Zhi Jing

Autumn has arrived, and it is again the season for selling felt hats. Since cutting hair became fashionable, felt hats have become increasingly popular. The old-style small caps are now mostly worn by older people, while others generally prefer a felt hat. However, the ways to choose and care for them are not widely known among hat wearers. Here are the essential points:

Felt hats are usually made of wool or rabbit fur, so there are wool felt hats and rabbit felt hats. Generally, the latter is more expensive than the former, so it is commonly believed that rabbit fur hats are better than wool felt hats. But this is not always the case. If you want to wear a rabbit fur hat, unless you pay a high price for a high-quality one, it is better to wear a wool felt hat. Inferior rabbit fur hats tend to tear at the top after being worn for a short time, while wool felt hats never have this problem. Moreover, the current market price for rabbit fur hats ranges from a dozen to sixty or seventy yuan, while wool felt hats cost only a little over ten yuan.

Felt hats are best when made of fine and pure materials, but do not judge by softness or hardness. Generally, people think that soft felt hats are better, but too much softness can easily cause the hat to lose its shape. It is best to buy new felt hats and avoid buying old stock that has deteriorated just to save money. After wearing a felt hat, you should brush off the dust and sand to prevent it from getting dirty over time. Also, felt hats should never be exposed to rain, even the most expensive ones. Do not mistreat them just because they are of high quality.

### First US Evacuation Ship, Monterey, Arrives in Shanghai This Afternoon; Departs at Midnight Tomorrow via Australia for Home; US Government Promises Aid to Impoverished Americans

With the situation in the Far East unstable, the US government is actively urging its citizens to return home, dispatching three mail ships to the Far East to transport evacuating citizens. The first ship, the Matson Company's SS Monterey, has arrived in Shanghai from San Francisco via Yokohama, Japan (excluding Kobe Bay), scheduled to arrive in Shanghai at 2 PM this afternoon. It is expected to dock at buoys 11 and 12. Passenger launches will depart from the Customs pier around 3 PM. The ship is scheduled to depart from Shanghai at 1 AM on the 4th (i.e., midnight on the 3rd) with evacuating citizens, heading to Australia and then returning to the US. Nine passenger launches will operate from the ship's arrival to departure. The last launch will depart from the Customs pier at 11 PM tomorrow night, with the second to last at 9 PM tomorrow night. It is reported that approximately 400 American citizens will be returning home on this ship. The arrival of this ship marks the beginning of the US government's second evacuation of citizens in three years. The first was in 1937 when fierce battles were taking place in the suburbs of Shanghai. The US Navy was ordered to assist in the evacuation of some American citizens in Shanghai. However, this evacuation is different from the one in 1937. The previous one was a mass evacuation without a predetermined procedure, while this one is an organized operation.

### Time Pressing, Few Depart

According to an investigation by the shipping company, as of last night, the SS Monterey still had many first-class cabins available, with no one inquiring about them. The main reasons for this are that the ship arrived in Shanghai too early, as most American citizens need several weeks to settle their affairs in Shanghai before returning home. Another reason is that the ship travels to the US via Australia, which takes more than two months, suitable only for those who have nothing to do. The President Pierce, which arrived in Shanghai earlier, will sail to the United States fully loaded with passengers around 2 AM tomorrow morning, but there are no evacuating citizens among the passengers because the cabins were fully booked long before the evacuation order was issued.

### Second Ship to Call at Korea

As for other evacuation ships, the second one, the SS Mariposa, is scheduled to depart from Shanghai on the 10th, and after calling at Qinhuangdao in North China, will take the route to Busan, Korea, because some American citizens there will board the ship to return to the US. The third ship, the SS Washington, will depart from Shanghai on November 21st. This is the last mail ship carrying evacuating American citizens. It will first go to Manila and then sail to San Francisco. The original plan to go via Los Angeles has been changed. It is also learned that the large US transport ship, SS Gold Star, left for Manila at 3:30 PM yesterday, carrying the documents and files of the US Navy's 4th Marine Regiment. The transport ship SS Chaumont is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai from Manila on the 20th to evacuate US Navy dependents.

### US Government Promises Financial Aid

The English-language "China Press" reports that since the US evacuation order arrived in Shanghai, American citizens in this port have been in a state of confusion. Only this morning (the 1st) did the first piece of good news arrive, namely that the US government will provide some form of financial assistance to impoverished American citizens. This is the result of the continuous efforts of the American Chamber of Commerce and the American Citizens' Association to provide relief in a time of need. The two groups have worked diligently in the past two weeks to improve the difficulties caused by the evacuation order. The scope of this financial assistance is not yet known and will depend on the amount of funds available and the results of an investigation. However, this financial assistance will be absolutely used for the benefit of completely impoverished American citizens. Regarding the Washington's fare of US$400 per person this month, local US officials expressed satisfaction this morning (the 1st) with the State Department's announcement of the Washington's third-class fare, as this shows that Washington has begun to understand the difficulties in Shanghai. It is hoped that all the current problems can be solved soon.

The US Ship Monterey Arrives in Shanghai Today

YMCA Seeks Donations of Winter Clothing for Shanghai's Poor

Every winter, the poor women and children of Shanghai suffer the threat of freezing and starvation in the bitter cold, which is very pitiful. It is expected that the situation will be even more tragic this winter due to the high cost of living. The YMCA has launched a campaign to solicit donations of winter clothing for Shanghai's poor and large quantities of cotton clothes, quilts, shoes, and socks for women and children (it would be even easier if they were washed and mended). We earnestly request all kind-hearted men and women from all walks of life in Shanghai to donate generously, for which there is immeasurable merit (please note that we do not solicit donations outside, and receipts will be issued for all items received).

Collection Point: Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA (Telephone 84040)

Mrs. Glassford Arrives in Shanghai

Mrs. Glassford, wife of Rear Admiral Glassford, commander of the US Yangtze Patrol, who has been in Japan for a long time, is on board the Matson Company's giant ship, SS Monterey, which arrived in Shanghai today. Mrs. Glassford is scheduled to meet her husband today and return home tomorrow. It is also learned that Mrs. Johnson, wife of US Ambassador Dr. Johnson, and her two children are also scheduled to return to the US on the SS Mariposa.

### Third Anniversary of the National Army's Withdrawal from Shanghai; All Sectors Expand Winter Clothing and Donation Campaign

The third anniversary of the National Army's withdrawal westward from Shanghai (November 12th) is approaching. Amidst the frequent good news, all sectors of the city deeply admire and remember the soldiers, and will commemorate this day with deep sorrow. However, due to the special circumstances, no ceremonies will be held. As in past anniversaries, entertainment will be automatically suspended and vegetarian food will be eaten for one day as a silent commemoration. However, given that it is now late autumn, and the soldiers at the front and the refugees in the rear lack warm clothing, a campaign to expand the donation of winter clothing and financial aid will continue to be launched on that day. The authorities in the two concessions will implement strict security measures to maintain order and prevent accidents. Less important roads may be temporarily closed.

### Hong Kong-Shaoguan Air Route, Once a Week, Officially Launched

The new Hong Kong-Shaoguan air route of the China National Aviation Corporation has been officially launched. Originally scheduled to fly once every two weeks, in addition to carrying passengers and mail, it also accepts goods. As Shaoguan is currently a key transportation hub into the mainland, the company, in order to facilitate passenger transport, has changed the frequency to once a week. Seat reservations are extremely crowded. It is said that this route is not entirely for profit, but was proposed by the Guangdong Provincial Bank. Each round trip, the bank reserves a certain number of seats for its own use. As a result, outside passengers who want to book seats on the Hong Kong-Shaoguan flight are finding it somewhat difficult.

### Police Department: Inspection of Patrol Officers, Deep Appreciation for Outstanding Detectives, Awarding of Medals by Mayor Cornell S. Franklin

Yesterday afternoon at 2:15 PM, the Chinese and Western patrol officers of the Public Concession Police Department held an inspection at the Shanghai Volunteer Corps drill ground. Those present included Major Baowen, Chief Patrol Officer; Fabur, Director of the French Concession Police Department; and high-ranking military officers from the American and Japanese defense forces. Mayor Cornell S. Franklin awarded medals and offered words of encouragement to the award-winning detectives. He also expressed deep appreciation for the past year's achievements of all police personnel. In addition to newspaper reporters, the general public was not allowed to attend the inspection, which was solemn and simple. The recipients of the first-class medals were Chinese Constable No. 1895, Hong Yonggui, and Chinese Detective No. 157, Peng Jinsheng.

### Chinese Army Repeatedly Captures Famous Cities: Citywide Jubilation and Excitement, Unprecedented Social Enthusiasm, Government Bonds Soar to Post-War Record High

Since the beginning of this week, the Chinese army has repeatedly reported victories, successively recapturing famous cities such as Nanning and Shaoxing. Yesterday, there was also news of the recovery of Yichang. The Chinese army is fighting more bravely than ever, and the day of victory is not far off. Therefore, people from all walks of life in this city are greatly encouraged, which is rare this year. The social enthusiasm caused by these victories has had a significant impact on the financial market in this city. Yesterday, domestic debt prices soared, with some reaching over [amount]. The closing price yesterday afternoon, compared with the closing price the day before, showed a sharp increase of 2.20 yuan for Tong Jia, and 2.05 yuan for Tong Wu. Tong Yi and Tong Bing also rose by 1.65 yuan each, and Tong Ding also rose by 1.20 yuan. In addition, the black market exchange rate also showed a loosening trend. The closing price of the British pound was approaching the four pence mark, at 3.954375 pence, and the US dollar also made significant gains to 6.125 yuan. The closing price of cash sycee fell by 108 yuan compared with the closing price the day before.

Shanghai Residents Invest, Concentrating on Government Bonds

After the Chinese government's determination to maintain creditworthiness, the price of government bonds in the Shanghai Securities grey market has set a new record since August 13th. The recent frequent victories in various places have greatly boosted market sentiment, which is sufficient to indicate the strengthening of the government's position and the consolidation of the legal tender's credit. This is indeed a good sign in financial trends. Some believe that the rise in government bonds is nothing more than the result of abundant speculative funds and large investors pushing up prices, and speculation is inevitable. However, when Chinese people use their surplus funds to purchase government bonds, although they hope to obtain high profits, it is ultimately an investment rather than speculation, and the funds are used for legitimate purposes rather than escaping or being used improperly.

### Famous British Playwright to Broadcast Tonight

According to the British Consulate, the famous British playwright Mr. Howard, is scheduled to give an important speech on the XCDN North China Daily News radio station at 8:15 tonight. Details of the speech will be announced by the radio station today at 12:45 PM and 7:45 PM. Mr. Howard is passing through Shanghai from England on his way to Australia and will only stay for one day. It is a rare opportunity for Shanghai residents to hear his speech. In addition, a recording of an important speech given by former British Foreign Secretary Alexander in England has been made into a film and will be broadcast globally by the London radio station tomorrow. Anyone with a shortwave radio can listen to it.

### Hong Kong to Restrict Tourist Entry Starting Next Month: Tourists Please Obtain Landing Permits When Purchasing Tickets, This Method is More Convenient Than in Singapore

The Hong Kong government, considering the excessive population density in Hong Kong, has decided to establish an immigration bureau next month to handle immigration procedures in order to limit population growth. The restrictive regulations will be implemented starting December 1st this year. As a first step, the bureau will dispatch personnel to study with responsible persons from major shipping companies the merchants and passengers going to Hong Kong from various places to determine who are reliable, and then the companies will issue landing permits on their behalf. All tourists going to Hong Kong can apply for a permit when purchasing tickets, and then go to Hong Kong with the permit. The above restrictions are more convenient than in other places such as Singapore. Detailed procedures and methods have not yet been announced.

### Foreign Ships Sailing to Zhejiang and Fujian Still Obstructed by Japanese Warships: The Moufu Wheel Intercepted in the Kanmen Waters

Although the number of Japanese warships stationed in the waters off Zhejiang and Fujian has been greatly reduced, the number of small gunboats has increased. They are constantly patrolling the waters off Zhejiang and Fujian, obstructing foreign ships sailing to the ports of Zhejiang and Fujian. Even those sailing in unrestricted areas such as Songmen, Gu'ao, and Fuqing are sometimes detained. Therefore, although foreign shipping companies in this city intend to maintain operations with difficulty due to the long suspension of shipping, they have not been able to determine the sailing schedule. If they are forced to return midway, the losses will be considerable.

Moufu Intercepted

The German shipping company Lihwa Foreign Company's Moufu Wheel set sail from Shanghai on the afternoon of October 29th and sailed to Wenzhou. On October 31st, it arrived in the Kanmen waters outside Wenzhou. Because it had to wait for high tide to enter the Ou River, it stayed outside the port for several hours. During this waiting period, a Japanese warship sent a speedboat carrying Japanese soldiers to board the ship for inspection. Then, they prevented the ship from sailing to Wenzhou. [Information Missing] had not been granted entry. However, according to the shipping department of the Moufu Wheel, there has been no telegram. According to those familiar with the shipping situation in Wenzhou, recently, all ships sailing to Wenzhou have entered the Ou River via the North entrance of Kanmen. This decision prevented the Moufu Wheel from entering via the South entrance, as the ship's draft was too deep and it was inconvenient to navigate, leading to the interception by the Japanese warship.

Fuqing Open to Navigation

Also, the Hai Fu Wheel of the Lihwa Foreign Company, which departed from Shanghai one day earlier than the Moufu, reportedly had a telegram to Shanghai yesterday from passengers on board, reporting that they had arrived safely in Wenzhou. However, the shipping department of the Hai Fu Wheel has not yet received an official telegram from the shipowner. It is unknown whether the passengers disembarked outside the port and traveled to Wenzhou by land. Shipping between Shanghai and Fujian, maintaining one route to Fuqing, has been ongoing for months without hindrance. However, the British Jiangsu Wheel and the German Jiang Dinglun, which are scheduled to sail to Haimen, have not been approved for customs clearance and the sailing schedule has not yet been determined. It is said that the Portuguese ship Aveiro, left for Songmen yesterday afternoon.

### Labor Dispute at French Company Settled: Workers Express that the Motive was Very Pure, The Result was Very Satisfactory

Yesterday, a person identifying himself as a worker from a French-owned water and electricity company sent a letter to this newspaper, saying: "Editor of Shen Bao, please accept the sincerity of my letter. We feel that the public may have a somewhat vague understanding of the labor unrest at the French-owned water and electricity company, perhaps suspecting that the content of the unrest was somewhat complex and chaotic. Now that the labor unrest has subsided, we, the workers who are struggling to survive, must explain our past intentions to everyone.

Although it is only my own words, I believe they represent the voices of many loyal and hard-working workers. (1) This labor movement may seem serious in form, but we were simply filled with sincerity, and we truly felt that the pressure of life at this time and place was too unbearable for us to endure. In order to feed ourselves and our families and prevent them from suffering from hunger and cold, we had no choice but to make this urgent request to the authorities. Therefore, what we did was absolutely pure.

(2) When this labor unrest was proceeding in a peaceful manner, we never expected that conspirators would take the opportunity to cause trouble. Some people were incited, causing the labor unrest to appear to be expanding. But we believe that this was nothing more than being used by others and would never shake or undermine the original sincere purpose of all our workers. Therefore, the fact that the labor unrest was able to achieve a satisfactory resolution is a testament to our legitimate strength.

The suppression of the troublemakers ultimately led to their failure. (3) Because of this long strike, the city's transportation was affected, causing the public to feel inconvenienced in their travel and increasing a lot of unnecessary consumption in terms of both spirit and material things. This makes us feel extremely uneasy. We are grateful to the public for their pity, concern for our plight, and sympathy and support for our actions. We are eternally grateful. Finally, we have frankly revealed our sincere hearts to the public. In addition to our deepest apologies, we hope that the public will forgive us." Sincerely, a worker from the French-owned water and electricity company.

### Japanese Planning for Next Year's Municipal Council Elections Early: Submitting Proposals to the Council's Election Committee, Advocating for Review of Elector Eligibility

According to the English-language Da Mei Wan Bao, the Japanese community in this city has already begun preparations for the Municipal Council elections in April of next year. A special committee representing the Japanese community in this city has submitted several proposals to the Municipal Council's Election Committee, which was established in August. The details are not yet known. It is understood that the most important proposal is to add an Elector Eligibility Review Board. Those who have not been examined and approved by this board and whose names are not on the electoral list published by the Municipal Council at the end of this year will not have the right to vote.

This proposal has been confirmed by the Japanese side. The Japanese side claims that this action is to make the election procedures in the Municipal Council annual election comply with the land regulations. The Japanese proposal also criticizes that in past elections, those responsible for handling the elections had the right to arbitrarily dispose of matters, resulting in a large number of taxpayers who were not on the list published by the Municipal Council still being able to participate in the elections.

After the Japanese submitted this request, the Municipal Council Election Committee has studied the matter. The committee has a total of six members: Savar (Chairman), O'Leman, Yasui, Vogemar, Mitchell, and Glass. The committee has only held one meeting to date. It is said that the Japanese proposals will be accepted. A decision on the two points of the proposal may be made at the second meeting next Wednesday.

### Two More French Ships Added to the Shanghai-Vietnam Line

French ships sailing on the Shanghai-Vietnam line already include the Rose, Ross, and Jintia, all three of which have returned to Vietnam in order. Later, the Guangdong and Songtai joined the route. The Guangdong has also returned to Vietnam. The Songtai arrived in port the day before yesterday (October 31st), bringing a large amount of foreign rice from Saigon and mooring at the Gonghexian Wharf to unload. It is scheduled to return to Haiphong and Saigon from Shanghai on Tuesday next week. The French company has recently dispatched the Bangkok to join the Shanghai-Vietnam line, which will arrive in Shanghai tomorrow, bringing a large amount of foreign rice. It is also learned that the Xijiang, which was detained in Haiphong a few days ago, has now been released. According to the French company, it will come to Shanghai from Haiphong within days and is expected to arrive on the 13th, also joining the route. There are now seven French ships sailing on the Shanghai-Vietnam line. The French postal ship D'Artagnan, which sails on the Vietnam-Philippines-Shanghai-Japan new route, arrived in Shanghai on the 30th of last month and is scheduled to go to Japan next Monday, returning to Shanghai around the 12th or 13th of this month and going to the Philippines on the 14th, returning to Saigon.

### Winter is Approaching, Winter Relief Efforts are Underway: YMCA Raises 30,000 Pieces of Winter Clothing, Relief Association Seeks Donations of Winter Clothing from All Sectors

Every winter in Shanghai, the poor people in the streets and alleys suffer from hunger and cold, facing the threat of death. This year, prices are high, and the livelihoods of the poor are even more difficult. It is expected that the tragic scene of people freezing to death on the streets will be even worse than in the past. Recognizing this, various charitable organizations have already begun to promote winter relief efforts to provide assistance. The YMCA has launched a campaign to raise 30,000 pieces of winter clothing for the poor, and has received widespread support from all sectors. Donations of old clothes or cash donations to the association are very enthusiastic. It is reported that once the association completes the fundraising at the end of November, it will print clothing vouchers according to the number of donations and carefully distribute them to the poor in the streets.

Selling Congee and Rice

The Chinese Taoist [Association] is selling rice at low prices, and the Three Religions Moral Charity Association is donating congee vouchers. Both are stepping up their efforts to expand their services to benefit the poor in the streets. The Wangnan Road Charity Organization United Relief Association has been organizing cold shelters and distributing steamed buns and ginger soup every winter for many years. According to the person in charge of the association, although the association's finances are extremely strained, this urgent relief effort, which is held once a year, will continue to be carried out. They are currently looking for a suitable location for the cold shelter in order to start the work.

Donating Winter Clothing

Tang Qiaqing, Xu Jiyi, and Yuan Lu, the chairman, vice-chairman and secretary-general of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association respectively, stated that although young and strong refugees in various shelters in this city have been given funds and sent away in turn, there are still many elderly, weak, disabled, and young people who have nowhere to go and are still being sheltered. With the harsh winter approaching, the winter clothing of these people is mostly old and tattered and cannot protect them from the cold. New clothes must be made to protect them from the cold. They issued a joint statement yesterday, earnestly appealing to all sectors, saying: "The severe winter is approaching, and the cold is pressing. The original winter clothing of the men, women, old, and young refugees in various shelters in this city is old, tattered, and insufficient to keep them warm. If we do not actively prepare, we are really afraid that they will suffer from cold and starvation. Therefore, we sincerely appeal to all philanthropists to continue their past enthusiasm for disaster relief and give us assistance, either by donating cash or donating winter clothing, so that these people can have the means to keep warm and be able to survive this difficult time. Then, not only will the refugees generally benefit from the relief, but this association will also be grateful beyond words. This is a public announcement, and we hope you will take it into consideration."

### Residents of Qianjia Lane Displaced: Japanese Remove Roofs, Residents Forced to Move

Since the assassination of Japanese military police sergeant Sato Seiichi in the boundary area of Youxi, the Japanese side has been in a state of panic and has been very resentful of the residents there, blockading Qianjia Lane on Yuyuan Road and the Yan family residence on Jessfield Road. Although the situation is now more relaxed, the residents there are still frightened several times a night and are extremely terrified. The following are the details that have been learned:

Forced Eviction

On the 26th, the Japanese army posted a notice in Qianjia Lane on Yuyuan Road, stating that in order to thoroughly prevent anti-Japanese elements, residents were ordered to organize a people's police and move out of Qianjia Lane so that it could be converted into a road. Since the day before yesterday, houses on both sides have been demolished by small workers sent by the Japanese side. As of yesterday, one-third of the houses had been demolished. The Japanese side plans to demolish all the houses in the lane.

Building Roads

The plan is to open up a road that is half a Chinese mile long and ten feet wide to connect Jessfield Road. One day before the demolition, the municipal police notified the residents to move out. However, the next day, a small number of residents who had not been able to move out due to the difficulty of finding a house, the Japanese side did not care at all and ordered the workers to go to the roof and demolish the roof first, forcing the residents to move out completely because they could not live there. During the construction period, the lane is still blocked, and residents can only move in and out of a narrow path in Lane 668. After the road is opened, if there is any remaining land, it will still belong to the owners, but the construction of houses must be designed by the owners and submitted to the Japanese side for review.

Bandits Rampant

As for the area along the cross-border road construction, although the Japanese army's search is more relaxed, bandits are rampant and robberies are frequent. The municipal police use the pretext of preventing bandits and also patrol in teams from time to time, searching pedestrians and residents, so that the residents of western Shanghai are both terrified by the Japanese army and disturbed by the municipal police. They truly feel frightened several times a night.

### Grain Supply Should Flow Freely: Provinces, Cities, and Counties Must Not Restrict Grain Sales

Recently, the Executive Yuan, in order to facilitate grain matters, issued an order to the provincial governments and economic committees of all war zones, stating: "The economic ties between provinces are inseparable, and grain, in particular, must flow freely. Grain owned by the people in all war zones and between war zones and non-war zones should be allowed to circulate freely among merchants, and should not be prohibited from entering or exiting, confiscated without reason, or prevented from passing through. Article 18 of the General Outline of Grain Management Measures in War Zones has clearly stated this, and Article 4 of the Grain Regulation Measures in Extraordinary Times has also clearly stipulated that places with surplus food should provide as much as possible to places with insufficient food, and provinces, cities, and counties must not restrict grain sales. However, it has recently been heard that many places misunderstand the meaning of self-sufficiency and completely disregard the situation of lack in neighboring provinces, even levying taxes and restricting transportation, causing grain prices to soar and making it impossible to regulate. Moreover, even within the same province, there are often times when counties do not communicate with each other. This phenomenon not only harms the people's livelihood, but its impact on the future of the war of resistance is extremely significant. In the future, provincial governments should allow merchants to circulate grain freely within their provinces, except for areas close to occupied areas, which should be strictly prohibited from supplying the Japanese. Local surpluses should also be encouraged for domestic transportation to maintain the people's food supply. Neighboring provinces lacking grain must be assisted in procurement and transportation to maintain the people's food supply. In addition to issuing orders separately, this order is hereby issued for compliance."

### Japanese Army Sets Fire Upon Withdrawal from Shaoxing: Many Institutions Affected, Shanghai-Shaoxing Telecommunications Restored

According to the English-language Da Mei Wan Bao, a telegram was received from a foreign resident in Shaoxing yesterday morning stating that after the Japanese army withdrew from Shaoxing, most of the city's commercial center was burned by the Japanese army. The county government, banks, news organizations, telegraph bureau, post office, and other public institutions were all set on fire by the Japanese army when they withdrew. However, the 15 foreign Christian missionaries and Catholic missionaries in the city were all safe.

Since the Chinese army in eastern Zhejiang recovered Shaoxing, Keqiao, and other important strongholds in the vicinity, the war situation has improved. According to telegrams received by Zhejiang groups in Shanghai, the elite Chinese troops that recovered Shaoxing are now pursuing westward after crossing Keqiao. The remnants of the Japanese army have retreated to Xiaoshan City and are cornered in a corner, stubbornly resisting with the defensive structures built on the outskirts of the city. Also, when Shaoxing was recovered, Japanese warships off Zhenhai attempted to land in order to contain the Chinese army and cover their retreat, but they were repelled by the Chinese army's brave resistance. Lights and telephones in Shaoxing have been restored, and telegrams between Shanghai and Shaoxing have been restored and are open for business. Exchange between Shanghai and Shaoxing has also been restored.

During this invasion by the Japanese army in western Zhejiang, Xiaofeng, Anji, Lin'an, Xindeng, and other counties were successively disrupted. The Provincial Government Committee meeting resolved to allocate 60,000 from the province's general reserve fund and hand it over to the administrative office to provide emergency relief to the counties affected by the disaster. The Provincial Relief Association of the Department of Civil Affairs will send personnel to jointly handle the matter.

### Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Cables Saigon: Requesting Return of Goods

Regarding the return of customs cargo from Gongfang to Hong Kong and Shanghai, the French authorities agreed, but the Japanese side prevented the loading of ships. It is reported that the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday telegraphed the Chinese Consulate in Saigon and the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, saying, "Goods from Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou destined for Vietnam via Shanghai and approved by the local consulate and the Vietnamese governor to be returned to Hong Kong and Shanghai. The previous agreement has been canceled, and Shanghai merchants are terrified. Please strive for it."

### Zhang Boying, Veteran of the Great Wall Line of Resistance, Commits Suicide by Hanging: Unable to Fit Prosthetic Leg After Leg Amputation Due to Injury, Plagued by Illness and Driven to Despair

According to the French-language Shanghai Daily, Zhang Boying, from Shandong, was 52 years old and had served as an officer. In the spring of 1933, he participated in the War of Resistance against Japan on the Great Wall line. He lost a leg due to injury. A philanthropist in Taixing gave him 300 yuan, and Zhang took the money to Shanghai to seek medical treatment and fit a prosthetic leg. However, the money was insufficient, and no one was willing to fit him with one. Recently, he also suffered from dysentery and was plagued by illness, which led him to despair. Zhang moved into the Yunzhou Hotel on Xinqiao Street on September 27th. The night before last, he hanged himself in his room. Yesterday morning (October 31st), the Yunzhou Hotel teaboy went to Zhang's room to deliver washing water and discovered the body. It was cold all over, and a suicide note was found in his clothes, expressing many feelings about his life and circumstances. Zhang had attempted suicide twice before, but was rescued both times. Once was on October 22nd, when he ingested opium worth five yuan. The second time was on October 25th, when he swallowed five boxes of matches, but both times he did not die. In his suicide note, Zhang claimed to be a Muslim and asked someone to notify the mosque on Guangdong Road to collect the body.

### Knitting Factory Owner Abandons Maid After Getting Her Pregnant: Maid Sues for Child Support, Abandoned After Cohabiting and Having a Child, Sues for Over 10,000 Yuan in Living and Education Expenses

Wang Afeng, a woman from Fenghua, is 26 years old and lives at No. 6 Yongqing Lane, Airlike Road. Recently, her three-year-old son, Feng Yinbao, through a lawyer as an agent, filed a petition with the Civil Mediation Office of the Special District Court II against Feng Zixing (46 years old), a Ningbo native and owner of the Xinchang Knitting Factory at No. 410 Malong Road, for payment of living expenses. The petition states in brief: "I came to Shanghai in April 1937, introduced by someone to work as a maid at the defendant's residence. Before long, the defendant used my youth to seduce me in every possible way. Seeing that I was ignorant and gullible, he dared to coerce me into an illicit relationship. When I became pregnant, the defendant rented a room at the Ninghe Hotel for a long period of cohabitation. On December 1, 1938, I gave birth to a son, named Yinbao. I thought that I would gain the defendant's love and that my life would be worry-free, but in reality, it was far from it. The defendant would often use the excuse of being busy with the store or being ill.

His footsteps became rare. After giving birth, I was plagued by illness, but the defendant did not treat me. When I asked for living expenses, he only gave me 30 or 40 yuan a month. Lately, he has even abandoned me. The meager living expenses have also been cut off. Abandoning me after seducing me is extremely obvious. Since I cohabitated with the defendant, there are witnesses and evidence, and Yinbao is the defendant's biological son, according to Article 1114, paragraph 1, subparagraph 1 and 4 of the Civil Code, he should bear the responsibility of support and should also bear the cost of education. I request the court to order the defendant to pay a lump sum of 12,120 yuan for ten years of living expenses and primary and secondary school education expenses." After receiving the petition, the court ordered mediation in Civil Court 4 yesterday morning by Judge Yang Delin. The defendant did not appear, and the court ruled that mediation was not possible in this case.

### Thief Commits Assault, Woman Shot

At around 1:15 AM yesterday, a shooting incident occurred at the home of Xu Jinwei, a local resident at No. 5, Lane 307, North Zhejiang Road, Public Concession. The injured person was Xu's wife, Ms. Ren (26 years old). The assailant was an armed thief. At that time, the woman was in the midst of a sweet dream when she suddenly heard footsteps on the roof. Xu and his wife woke up in fright. Ms. Ren got out of bed and jumped onto the balcony to investigate. She caught sight of a thief entrenched on the roof ridge. Ms. Ren shouted for help to catch the thief. Unexpectedly, the thief fired a shot, grazed Ms. Ren's abdomen, and hit her leg. Blood gushed out. The thief took the opportunity to escape. Afterwards, Xu reported the incident to the police station, who dispatched detectives to investigate and then rushed her to the Renji Hospital for treatment. They are now strictly pursuing the escaped thief to bring him to justice.

### Zhu Yumin Conspires with Gang, Scares and Defrauds Cousin, Three Defendants Separately Sentenced

Zhu Yumin, from Anhui, lived at No. 1034 Gordon Road and did not engage in proper work. He associated with criminals. Between the 24th and 25th of last month, he colluded with Lou Minwei, from Ningbo, to use threatening means against his cousin Zhu Junhou, who ran the Yihe Pawnshop at No. 1030, Tongren Road, to extort a large sum of money. The case was reported to the Putuo Road Police Station, who arrested Zhu and Lou with the help of Chinese Detective Tang Zihong and Detective Gu Yinxuan. Together with Wei Zhengquan, from Shaoxing, they were sent to the First Special District Court for interrogation. Yesterday morning, Judge Huang Risheng opened Criminal Court 3 for investigation. The lawyer of the police station, Zhang Tianyin, stated that he was prosecuting the defendant Zhu Yumin for the crime of kidnapping, threatening, and defrauding for money; Lou Minwei for assisting in threatening and defrauding for money; and Wei Zhengquan for concealing criminals. The three defendants had previously been convicted of crimes such as fraud and theft and had served prison sentences. Zhu Yumin had been given a suspended sentence. He and the victim, Zhu Junhou, were cousins from the same great-grandfather. After Judge Huang's trial, Zhu Yumin was sentenced to one year in prison, Lou Minwei to six months, and Wei Zhengquan to fifty days of detention, respectively, as a warning.

### Dock Thugs Steal from Passengers, Pose as Guides to Rob People, Eight Culprits Arrested and Awaiting Investigation

A group of idlers loiters around the Bund area wharves in this city. Whenever overseas passengers arrive in Shanghai on foreign ships, these individuals approach those who are unfamiliar with the routes or places to visit, offering to act as guides. On the 23rd of last month, a certain foreign ship arrived in Shanghai from America and docked at the New Customs Wharf. Among the passengers were four Cantonese Chinese, including Cai Yuanhuang, who were unfamiliar with the city. Several wharf guides led them to various companies to purchase goods. In the evening, they were guided to brothels for entertainment. Unexpectedly, these rogues took the opportunity to rob Cai Yuanhuang of 200 US dollars, 9 Hong Kong dollars, a gold watch, and a gold ring before fleeing. Cai reported the incident to the General Inspectorate, and Chinese detectives Liao Guihe and Qian Xianting arrested eight suspects, all Cantonese, including Huang Shi, Yu Jin, Zhong En, Liu Fu, Ye Cheng, Liang Zhuo, Huang Shuang, and Yu Qi, at the Customs Wharf at 2:30 PM the day before yesterday. They were taken to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the First Special Court's Criminal Division. The police lawyer Qian Xunjiu presented the above facts, stating that the case required investigation and requesting permission for detention. Judge Feng briefly questioned Huang Shi and others and approved their detention for further investigation.

### Agency Supervisor Embezzles Public Funds, Sentenced to One Year Imprisonment and Ordered to Compensate the Store

Dingxin Xieji Cotton Cloth Store, located at No. 2 Lane 4, Baliqiao Street, was established by Cheng Lansun from Nantong, who raised 24,000 yuan in July of this year. Since its opening, the store has been quite prosperous. The store's staff members were all also shareholders. In August of this year, the store's manager, Cheng Lansun, and assistant manager, Yu Guangyuan, went to their hometown of Putong on important business, entrusting all the store's affairs to the supervisor, Liu Shaolian, as acting manager. Unexpectedly, Liu, with great power in his hands, frequently went to gambling dens in western Shanghai during his off-duty hours. In a few days, he lost all 6,800 yuan of the store's capital in a desperate gamble. When assistant manager Yu Guangyuan returned to Shanghai, he discovered Liu Shaolian's embezzlement and reported it to the French Concession Police, who arrested Liu and escorted him to the First Criminal Division of the Second Special Court, where he was prosecuted for embezzlement. After trial by Judge Zhang Minsheng, the verdict was announced yesterday. The main text stated that Liu Shaolian was guilty of embezzlement and sentenced to one year of imprisonment, with an additional civil suit ordering him to pay 6,800 yuan in compensation.

### Gatekeeper's Handgun Snatched

Chen Minde, 45 years old, a Shandong native and gatekeeper at Xinfu Lane, Route Ghisi, French Concession, has held this position for eight years.

They threatened him and snatched his service handgun before escaping. Chen reported the incident to the police station, and the relevant police station has notified all stations to conduct a strict search.

When Sato refused, he drew a sharp blade and stabbed Li Jinyuan to death, resulting in a homicide. The details have already been reported in the newspapers. It is now known that the murderer Sato and his accomplice returned to their residence late that night and were arrested by detectives who were lying in wait. They were taken to the French Concession Police Station for interrogation and then transferred to the Japanese Consulate for investigation.

### Letter to the Editor

To the esteemed editor of Shen Bao,

Regarding the article "Dispute over the Sale of the Medical College" published in your newspaper on the 23rd of this month, we find that it is inconsistent with the facts. This spring, Guo Boliang, the president of the China Medical College, intended to step down because the college was short of funds. Therefore, Ma Wenwo, Zhu Wenming, and five others served as economic directors and were responsible for repaying the 7,000 yuan that President Guo had advanced. They immediately raised 3,500 yuan, of which 500 yuan was set aside for school opening expenses and 3,000 yuan was paid to President Guo. The remaining 4,000 yuan would be paid in two installments. Qin Bowei was hired as the new president, and Zhu Wenming served as the director of general affairs and a professor of gynecology. Later, because Mr. Mi's teaching method was not good, the students strongly requested that the president hire another professor. As a result, Mr. Zhu complained, and President Qin resigned, which caused a great deal of student unrest and loss. Zhu Wenming saw no profit to be made and was concerned about being liable for school debts, so he filed a lawsuit to recover his share of the investment. The college's purpose is to promote scholarship and cultivate talent, and it has a permanent nature that is different from ordinary partnerships. Because it is in liquidation, filing a lawsuit to recover the share of the investment is obviously detrimental to education. The court rejected his lawsuit, and he is also willing to pay 342.88 yuan out of the 2,000 yuan that former President Guo advanced. After President Qin resigned, the college hired Zhu Hegao as his successor. The so-called sale and transfer is not a fact. As for the dispute between the Zhu brothers, the Zhu family also denied it. Moreover, Zhu Xiaonan is the president of the New China Medical College and has nothing to do with our college. We are afraid that the rumors are inaccurate and kindly ask your newspaper to correct them. Respectfully submitted, Ma Wenwo, October 26th.

To the esteemed editor,

After reading the news item on the dispute at the China Medical College on October 23rd, there are many inaccuracies. This college was founded in 1927 and has spent large sums of money over the years, all of which have been compensated for by famous figures in the medical field. Since the construction of the college building on Tiantong'an Road, medical professionals such as Ding Zhongying, Xu Xiaopu, Zhu Ziyun, and Chen Cunren have spent tens of thousands of dollars. Former President Guo Boliang transferred the college to Ma Wenwo because he could not bear the pressure of debt. Mr. Ma also found it difficult to maintain and transferred it to the current President Zhu Hegao before a semester was over. Recently, there has still been a deficit of several thousand yuan each semester, as evidenced by the account books of former accountant Xia Sunhuan and the obvious facts now. How can there be talk of making a profit? As for the dispute between the Zhu brothers, it concerns the New China Medical College and has nothing to do with this college. The advertisements published in various newspapers can be consulted. Such a reversal of the facts is related to the reputation of this college. We hereby issue a statement requesting a correction. Respectfully submitted, Wu Keqian, Dean of Academic Affairs, China Medical College, October 28th.

### Broken Sword Head

‚Äî Pinpin

On the bookshelf, I found a collection of poems with a poem by Bai Juyi called "Broken Sword Head," which reads: "I picked up a broken sword head, but I don't know why it was broken. A handful of cyan steel, abandoned and no one collects it. I have a mean and obstinate nature, liking the firm and disliking the soft. Do not lightly break a straight sword, it is still better than a crooked hook."

The sword is the weapon of so many heroes. Riding a white horse, wielding a shining cyan sword, splashing, stirring up the sky with yellow sand, earning bloody human heads, how mighty! The only thing that stirs the heart is the sword.

Now the sword is broken, buried in the mud, no longer stirring people's hearts.

Wrong, you should, even more so, let your heart beat for this broken sword. Do you know why it was broken? It was to cut down those fierce insects and leopards. "Slaying those whales and saving my innocent children." This sword must have accomplished something, otherwise, like the sword that a young master hangs on his waist for show, it would never break. A complete sword makes people fear, a broken sword makes people respect.

The sword is broken, but its soul is not broken, it is still strong and upright. Look at that hook, it is complete, but how servile, bending its back, being all amiable, only knowing how to cater to others, flatter them, and do all sorts of base things. Which one is great? We must shout, "Broken Sword Head!"

Those who fight against evil forces will live forever in heaven and earth.

### Trap

‚Äî Wang Yunquan

Living on the third floor was a thin, long-footed woman who walked with a limp, like a stick. She often grumbled about this and that, scolding this and that, as if she were the owner of the house. Once, the light at the stairs broke, and she quickly said, "It must have been them" (referring to the tenants other than herself) "who broke it while emptying the chamber pot last night." When the water bill increased, she always complained as if wronged, "Heaven knows, I use so little... they wash clothes..."

Naturally, this was not accidental. It was said that in the month she moved in, the landlord won the top prize in the savings association and also had a son. Plus, she knew how to flatter people? She was good with her words, a truly capable and blessed woman. No wonder the landlady liked her and believed her words‚Äîshe could practically run most of the household. Therefore, others were not happy and didn't dare to be too friendly with her, but she often pulled others aside and said, "I'm a straightforward person, I always say what's on my mind... People say I'm bad, but really..." Actually, it was just her paranoia. Who would dare to say she was bad and offend her? Although others always thought, "This is a gossiping, troublemaking woman."

The person she got along with best was the woman in the attic room. Her husband worked at the outer wharf, and she lived alone with a child who looked to be four or five years old. She was not good at doing things; no, it could even be said that she was a bit lazy, but everyone liked her, calling her Sister Li. She often invited people to chat in her spacious attic room, offering them soy sauce and melon seeds‚Äîthey seemed very close.

One day, the small-footed woman ran to Sister Li and said:

"The landlady's eldest son is coming up from the countryside soon, so she wants to use this attic room for herself... She said she's very sorry to you, please find a house as soon as possible," she said very politely, adding, "She said you've been a tenant here for many years, so she's embarrassed to tell you herself, so she asked me..."

If she wanted it for herself, there was nothing else anyone could say, and she had to agree to find a house. But houses were not easy to find, and the days quickly passed, but she still couldn't find a suitable house.

At the end of the month, a man who looked to be twenty years old came. Others thought, "Is this the landlady's son? He's so old." They seemed a bit surprised. That day, the landlady and Sister Li had a not-so-small conflict.

"How can this be? I notified you a month ago, how can..." the landlady said righteously.

"...You have to know that I'm a single woman and don't have much money... and it's hard to find a house now, unlike before..." Everyone sympathized with Sister Li, although her voice was low and seemed weak.

"I don't care... I don't care about these..."

"...I said I will move, but..." Sister Li's voice became firm and loud.

They gradually argued more fiercely, but in the end, the talkative small-footed woman managed to mediate. She said with difficulty,

"Everyone is a nice person, it's embarrassing to argue... How about this, stay for another five days, you won't be able to find a house in five days..."

This time, everyone said the small-footed woman was loyal and willing to help.

Sister Li finally moved out sadly. The landlady's son moved into the spacious and bright attic room; but after a few days, he left again, reportedly because there was something going on in the countryside and he couldn't come back for a while.

The small-footed woman moved from the dark third floor into the attic room, saying, "This is temporary, temporary." But she looked very happy.

The third floor was rented out, and the landlady's son never came. The small-footed woman seemed to be in even better spirits, and the number of times she scolded people increased; her voice could be heard all the time‚Äîit made the air tremble and circle around.

### Knowing Yourself

‚Äî Zu Geng

In ancient Greece, there was a famous saying, "Know thyself."

Do you think you "know yourself" just because you know your name is Zhang San or Li Si, your nickname is Agou or Amao, and you are from the south or the north? Do you also think you "know yourself" just because you know you need warm clothes when you're cold and food when you're hungry? If that's what it means to know yourself, then that famous saying is just a waste of words. Even if the Greeks were stupid, they wouldn't have considered it a famous saying.

In our opinion, you only truly "know yourself" when you can understand your place in humanity and the responsibilities you should bear towards humanity.

In that case, knowing yourself is not an easy thing. People often do things that benefit themselves at the expense of others, or even benefit no one, because they don't know themselves. Sometimes, they have a flash of insight and know that what they are doing is against their conscience, that they are acting willfully and irresponsibly, and that they are letting down both others and themselves. But this flash of insight cannot withstand external distractions and disappears with a whoosh, leaving no trace. As a result, everything becomes a blur.

Even so, people will eventually know themselves. As the ancients said, "A man's words are good when he is about to die." But if you only truly "know" yourself at the last moment, it can only be considered a wasted understanding.

Hawthorne Detective Cases

### The Ballerina's Destiny

‚Äî Written by Cheng Xiaoqing

When we arrived at the police station, Song Quan Hesheng had not yet reported, but we obtained two other pieces of information: one was that the bullet in the wooden wall of the telephone room at the Yadong Hotel had been extracted and inspected, and it was a 0.45-mm caliber bullet, the same as the one in the corpse's chamber. Another piece of information was that the green Johnson car number 80844, which Hawthorne had seen outside the Yadong Hotel, had been investigated by Ni Jinshou, who had sent a detective named Hu Lin to the Johnson Company. After much effort, the detective Hu Lin finally found the driver who was related to car number 80844. It was said that a man named Zhao often hired this car and had been hiring it for more than twenty days. However, there was more than one driver, and they were changed every other day; this was also due to Zhao's request. The driver on duty on the 18th night was named Zhu Fuqing. After finding Zhu Fuqing, Hu Lin wrote a long report on the investigation.

When we arrived at the station, this report was already on Ni Jinshou's desk. Although there were many unclear and misspelled words in the report, the timing of the vehicle's movements was written very clearly. The timing of the movements started from the evening of the previous day, and I am now excerpting it below:

At 7:30 PM on the 18th, the car drove to No. 27 Qingpu Road. Zhao Boxiong went into the house and came out after a while, without staying. Then, the car drove to the downtown area of Fuzhou Road and stopped in front of several restaurants. He seemed to be looking for someone. At around 8:15, he seemed to have found the person he was looking for at the Baimei Restaurant. Because the car stayed in front of the Baimei Restaurant for a long time, until 9:00, he got into the car and followed another black-plated car to the Shanghai Theater. Zhu Fuqing also stated that the registration number of the black-plated car was 50090. (Ni Jinshou later added that this car was Lu Jianjin's.)

After stopping in front of the Shanghai Theater, Zhao Boxiong also went in to watch the movie. At this time, Zhu Fuqing was able to steal time to eat dinner, but Zhao Boxiong may not have eaten dinner at all.

The theater ended at 11:30. Zhao Boxiong came out first, got into the car, and still told Zhu Fuqing to follow the neighboring black-plated car number 50090. Zhu Fuqing also saw that the black-plated car was occupied by a man and a woman. The man was a tall, fat person; the woman was wearing a white cheongsam with a dark short coat, dressed very fashionably. (154)

### Anna May Wong Supports the One Bowl of Rice Movement, Hu Shih and Lin Yutang Make Brilliant Remarks, European and American Playwrights Also Enthusiastically Support

‚Äî New Film

American people have launched a "One Bowl of Rice" movement for two years in order to show sympathy for China's resistance against Japan. This year's movement was held as usual, and a dinner party was held in a hotel in New York on October 1 as a prelude to the "One Bowl of Rice" movement. Dr. Hu Shih, the Chinese ambassador to the United States, spoke the most at the dinner table, and before that, Mr. Hu personally went to major cities to give speeches, promoting the advancement of the "One Bowl of Rice" movement, which lasted for several weeks and was quite tiring, but the results were also remarkable.

This year's banquet was unprecedentedly grand, including many new programs, such as fashion shows and oriental custom performances, which were all unprecedented. As predicted in advance, the donations from this year's "One Bowl of Rice" movement will also exceed those of previous years. It is particularly worth mentioning that the famous Chinese actress Anna May Wong served as the chairwoman of the conference that night. This Chinese star is known to people in the Far East. She came to her motherland in 1936 and also came to Shanghai.

At the same time, the famous American actor George Balanchine performed a Chinese opera on stage, and the script was written by Vernon Duke. The music used was completely based on traditional Chinese tones. In addition to Dr. Hu Shih, the famous Chinese writer Dr. Lin Yutang, the American female critic Dorothy Thompson, and the contemporary French playwright Henri Bernstein, who fled to the United States, also gave speeches. And enthusiastically support China's unprecedented great cause of resisting Japan.

### Watching the "One Year" of the Lone Army Theater Troupe

‚Äî Yuan Afeng

From 1937 to August 1938, Xia Yan contributed his four-act play "One Year" in response to the objective environment of Shanghai. It portrays the ugly phenomena that have not been eliminated in the midst of suffering, but affirmatively writes out the passionate and heroic posture of the excellent children of the Yellow Emperor.

Especially valuable is that this script is played by the Lone Army Theater Troupe. This makes the "From now on, we leave our lovely hometown" spoken by Liu Ailu (played by Shi Hongmo) in the first act, and the "For seven years, we have had no hometown" shouted by Yu Mingyang (played by Liu Yaoting) in the third and fourth acts, feel more intimate and real. It makes the tragic and indignant emotions of the drama even higher.

The story is simple, describing the family of an aviator who fled from a city along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway to Shanghai. The head of the family, Liu Ailu, is a person of integrity, but not very determined. From the whipping of the dog-like Liu Decai, we can see his inner integrity. And after listening to the theory of the female student Yu Zhihua, he said, "I am also relieved." We know that such a character will have instability.

In addition, the not-yet-universal awakening of intellectual women in the family is also clearly indicated in the play. "One Year" does not strive to create heroes, but objectively portrays the typical characters around us.

Shi Hongmo's acting is the best. Not only is he experienced, but he can also show the old age that old people should have in the third and fourth acts. The rest are also competent. However, if a pure Mandarin method is adopted, then the Hunan and Shandong accents should be more avoided during future rehearsals.

Finally, for the Lone Army Theater Troupe, we hope that those engaged in drama work can give them more cultivation and encouragement.

### A Blessing for "Literary Films"

‚Äî Shi Gong

For some time, the Chinese film industry's silver screen has been dominated by historical costume dramas, such as "Fei Zhen'e Assassinating the Tiger," "Ge Nen Niang," "Assassinating the King of Qin," and "Xiang Fei." Suddenly, a huge wave has risen again in the summer, said to be folk tale films, starting with "The Butterfly Lovers," which has not yet been fully released. It is said that the silver screen may be undergoing a positive transformation.

This positive transformation on the Chinese silver screen is the production of literary films. The literary masterpiece "Romance of the West Chamber" has already started filming at the Guohua Film Company, with "Golden Voice" Zhou Xuan starring as "Hongniang" and Bai Yun playing the role of "Zhang Sheng." It is said that Liu Zhonghao wants to film it as a song film and make it China's "The Merry Widow," so it should be luxurious, magnificent, and stunningly beautiful. However, this is a costume drama. I still hope that it will not degenerate into frivolous jokes, pornography, and low-level entertainment.

Even better news is that the Minhua Film Company, directed by Fei Mu, is about to film a modern literary blockbuster about Confucius. And the Jin Xing Film Company is also going to film the playwright Yu Ling's "Flowers Sprinkled with Tears." It is said that this literary film by Minhua Film Company has almost been decided to be an adaptation of Ba Jin's "Family." Moreover, it will be directed by a famous former German Ufa film director. This is probably the first time in Chinese film history that a German director has been used, which is worth noting. I wonder who is adapting the script? As far as I know, there are already two versions, one is a collaboration between Zhao Jingshen and Du Zimei, which was announced in the summer, and the other is a recent adaptation by Wu Tian of the Shanghai Drama Art Society. I hope that the "anarchist" color will be removed.

Indeed, in a time when the silver screen is filled with smog, some people think of producing literary films, especially since Minhua Film Company and Jin Xing Film Company can resolutely start filming modern, forward-thinking literary masterpieces. Who can say that this is not the latest transformation of the Chinese silver screen?

"Transformation," "positive transformation." For this, I wish "literary films" a blessing, a blessing.

### Romance of the West Chamber

‚Äî New Talent Used

Guohua plans to invest heavily in the production of "Romance of the West Chamber." The roles of Hongniang and Zhang Sheng have already been decided, and the Hai Xing News Agency has reported on it. However, Guohua officials plan to use new talent for the role of Cui Yingying. It is understood that a Miss Xu has been internally selected for the role. It is said that this person has been on stage before, has a beautiful face, and a graceful figure. Guohua's owner believes that if she can focus on this, she will easily become famous. The reporter said: Today, the film industry's need for new talent is even greater than before. However, new talent cannot persevere and often disappears like a flash in the pan. Therefore, the film industry is still dominated by a number of old-timers.
