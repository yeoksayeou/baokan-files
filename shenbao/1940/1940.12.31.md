### President Roosevelt Clearly Declares Full Aid to China and Britain, Praises China's Long-Term Resistance Against Japan, Predicts Inevitable Failure of the German-Italian-Japanese Axis

Washington - President Roosevelt, in his fireside chat to the nation last night, his first since being elected for a third term, resolutely opposed suggestions for the United States to initiate a peace movement and firmly predicted the inevitable failure of the Rome-Berlin-Tokyo alliance. While strongly condemning the Axis powers and Japan, the President praised China's heroic resistance against Japan and pledged to provide China and Britain with all possible assistance short of war. President Roosevelt also clarified his plan to keep the United States from being drawn into the war, which is to do its best to provide material assistance to China and Britain to defeat the Axis powers and Japan. (United Press, 30th)

Washington - President Roosevelt, in his broadcast to the nation last night, expressed opposition to the suggestion that the United States should launch a peace movement. At the same time, he predicted in a confident tone that the "Rome-Tokyo-Berlin" axis would inevitably fail. The President called on the American people to make the country a "great arsenal for democracies" and demanded the expansion of "war necessities" exports to Britain. Roosevelt condemned Japan and other Axis signatory countries, calling them an "unholy alliance, intended to rule and enslave all mankind." The President assured the nation that the United States would not send soldiers to fight in Europe, but said that if the United States wanted to avoid fighting Germany in the future, it must increase the amount of raw material aid to Britain. He said, "As long as Britain remains our strongest naval neighbor in the Atlantic, we need not worry about a German attack. Some people deeply doubt this view, while others deeply believe that if the Axis countries were our neighbors, could we be calm and carefree? We would even say that the United States is now living under the gun. If we want to survive in this world, we must, according to the principles of a 'wartime economy,' make ourselves a military country forever. Frankly speaking, danger is indeed ahead of us. To deal with this crisis, we must be prepared. We are well aware that we cannot escape the crisis, nor can we avoid it by climbing into bed and covering our faces." The President praised China's long-term resistance against Japan, saying that China is America's "great defense." He also indicated that China would obtain more raw material aid from the United States. The President also said, "Any South American country in German hands would be used by Germany as a base for invading the republics of the Western Hemisphere. Nowadays, some people believe that Germany will not attack the Western Hemisphere. This kind of wishful and dangerous thinking is the reason why countless countries have been tragically destroyed. Let us not evade the facts that we cannot avoid. For two years, we have had sufficient experience that no country can appease totalitarianism, and no one can tame a tiger and turn it into a kitten. For the same reason, violence cannot be appeased. We all know that any country that wants to live in peace with Germany can only pay the price of complete surrender. I dare to clearly declare to the nation that if we can provide full assistance to countries fighting the Axis, we are at great risk of being drawn into the war; otherwise, we can only watch our allies disintegrate one by one and wait for us to become the target of another great war." Many believe that the President's remarks were a simple and direct response to Germany's previous threats to the United States, forbidding it from continuing to aid Britain. The President said that his goal was to enable the United States "to avoid the scourge of war while still maintaining its independence and freedom." He made it clear that he was prepared to provide full raw material assistance to China and Britain in order to achieve that goal and ultimately lead to the failure of the Axis powers. He also said, "At this time of world crisis, I now recall the situation eight years ago, when the domestic crisis was urgent, American industry was almost completely shut down, and the national banking system was also collapsing. At that time, I told the American public about the impact of the banking crisis on our daily lives. Today, the United States is encountering a new crisis. I would like to tell the nation the same views. Never before has American culture been in such danger as it is today. The treaty signed by the three powers in Berlin on September 27, 1940—two European countries and one Asian country—jointly threatens the United States, saying that if the United States interferes with or hinders the process of expansion of the three countries—which aims to achieve control of the world—then they will jointly take final action against the United States. The Axis countries not only admit but also proclaim that the theories of their governments and the theories of our government have no possibility of lasting peace. Faced with this undisguised threat, the United States has no right or reason to encourage talk of peace, because the date when the aggressive countries abandon their ambitions to conquer the world has not yet arrived. Currently, Germany and Italy are being obstructed by Britain and Greece on the other side of the Atlantic, while Japan is fighting China in Asia. A part of our fleet is currently in the Pacific. Some people in our country believe that the wars in Europe and Asia have nothing to do with us, but what we are most concerned about is that the demons of war in Europe and Asia must not gain control of the ocean reaching the Western Hemisphere." (United Press, 30th)

### British Officials Express Warm Welcome

Washington - President Roosevelt's broadcast to the nation last night can be described as the most sharply worded speech since taking office, and it made a clear warning to Japan. In a solemn tone, he solemnly announced that the majority of the American fleet is now in the Pacific. The most careful and emphasized part of the speech was not about the discussion of the war, but rather about the talk of national security. The President then mentioned the Far East, saying that China is fighting Japan in another great war to defend freedom. (Reuters, 30th)

London - Reuters diplomatic correspondent reports that officials here have warmly welcomed President Roosevelt's speech, considering it further evidence that the United States recognizes the dangers faced by democracy, no less in the Western Hemisphere than in Europe and Asia, and as the most reasonable and powerful denunciation of Nazism to date. They are particularly pleased with the American President's recognition of the futility of any attempt to appease evil forces. The American President's statement that the United States is the arsenal of democracy and his frank expression of confidence that the Axis powers will ultimately fail are a source of inspiration for British leaders and the people. (Reuters, 30th)

Washington - President Roosevelt delivered a speech last night stating that if Britain were defeated, the American people would likely be subject to the Axis powers' military force. The President's speech has been welcomed by all parties. The President said, "No matter how a dictator or several dictators interpret and threaten America's full determination to aid Britain, it cannot weaken this determination." Although comments from some isolationists could not be obtained, the majority of the public seems to support the President's stance. Willkie, the defeated Republican candidate in the election, refused to make any criticism. The Washington Post commented in an editorial, "The President's speech last night was delivered in the clearest language of his life. If we attempt to advocate peace between Britain and Germany, he will definitely reject it." The New York Times, which opposed Roosevelt's third term, declared, "More than half of the nation will sincerely support the President's speech." (International News Service, 10th)

### Japanese Military Angered by Britain and the United States, Claims Aid to China Continues Resistance, Japan's Difficulties Are Just Beginning

Tokyo - The Japanese military today issued a statement reviewing the war situation in China this year, denouncing Britain and the United States for providing assistance to Chongqing's continued resistance. The military statement condemned Britain and the United States, saying that they were attempting to sacrifice the masses of China to weaken Japan. The statement said, "The war situation is gradually becoming unfavorable to Chongqing, so it is possible for Britain and the United States to increase aid. In order to overcome this situation, we should put greater pressure on Chongqing." The statement said that the Chinese side's deaths in the war this year totaled 59,000, and 1.8 million since the beginning of the war. The Japanese side's deaths in the war this year were 13,000, and the total number since the beginning of the war was 100,000. The statement also said that as long as General Chiang Kai-shek can obtain assistance from Britain and the United States, he will continue to resist Japan, and the Japanese military has decided to continue the war until the end. "At a time when the future of the nation is facing increasing difficulties, we must not slacken our increasingly heavy responsibilities." (United Press, 30th)

### Netherlands East Indies Government Implements Import Controls, Intending to Exclude Japanese Goods, Japanese Exporters Extremely Panicked

Tokyo - According to the Japan Times, the Netherlands East Indies government will implement new import control measures starting on January 1 next year. The import quotas for seventeen kinds of goods, such as cement, light bulbs, glassware, agricultural tools, and chemicals, will be restricted. Japanese exporters, especially merchants in Kobe and Osaka, are extremely anxious after hearing the news. Japanese commercial organizations, such as the Nanyang Exporters Association, have convened emergency meetings to discuss countermeasures. According to Asama, director of the information section of the Osaka Foreign Trade Bureau, the measures taken by the Netherlands East Indies authorities are "an unfriendly act towards a friendly country." "Judging from the list of goods with import restrictions, it can be seen that their intention is to exclude Japanese goods. Therefore, from next spring, Japan's exports to that area will definitely be sharply reduced. This move was instigated by Britain and the United States, which is self-evident. However, Britain does not have enough goods to supply the needs of the East Indies, so the majority of trade in that area will inevitably belong to the United States. Japan is now appealing to the East Indies authorities to cooperate in order to jointly restore prosperity in the Far East. The fact that the authorities in that area have adopted such an anti-Japanese attitude is a clear rejection of cooperation with Japan's goodwill, which is regrettable." (Havas, 30th)

### Japanese Commissioner to Britain Discusses British-American Cooperation

Tokyo - Date Bu, a Japanese Ministry of Finance commissioner stationed in London, returned to this country from Britain and recently gave a statement to a reporter from the "Japan Times," saying, "After the British economic institutions closely linked, because its foundation is solid, it is still as healthy as ever, and there is no sign of collapse. As for what the current economic situation in Britain is really like, we are suffering from a lack of information, so it is difficult to make a practical explanation. We can only speculate on the general appearance. Britain has huge amounts of funds stored in the United States. As long as the United States continues to provide financial assistance to Britain, the British economy will not go bankrupt for a single day. The British people bear a heavy burden, especially income tax, which requires a tax of eight shillings and six pence per pound, but Britain's material resources are still very abundant, especially food, which is not in short supply. In short, the only wartime scene in Britain at the moment is that German planes are constantly bombing Britain, making people feel uneasy." (Havas, 29th)

Editorial

### Farewell, 1940

The clock of time has stopped again today. The turbulent and tragic New Year's Eve ends the difficult and cruel year of 1940. Everything about this year will forever enter the realm of history, and because it is different from ordinary years, it will be forever remembered by history. Future generations reading history will pay special attention to the historical facts of this year, and we are a cell within these historical facts. What future generations pay attention to is mostly what we have personally witnessed. The historical facts are still fresh, and all are worth recalling. There is no need for reporters to retell them!

We curse aggression. Aggressors are the culprits, the root of the disaster. They not only seized 1940 but also reversed human civilization by decades. Killing and destruction are their direct sins. They destroyed countless cities, deprived countless people of their freedom, and plunged countless people into greater poverty and suffering. They also promoted countless, sinful consequences. The entire world in this year of 1940 almost became a year of more harm than good. However, what have the aggressors gained? Every day they drive thousands of people to risk their lives, every day they turn hundreds of tons of explosives into ashes. In short, they sacrifice immeasurable manpower and resources to try to carry out their aggression. No matter how much the occupied areas have been controlled due to the advancement of violence, and how many subjugated people have been subjugated, have they been swallowed up forever? Can they be safely digested? Since violence absolutely has no room for winning heartfelt submission, is the considerable expanse and numerous people not enemies of the aggressors? Indeed, the so-called enemy countries and enemies are, at least in the eyes of the aggressors, temporarily not to be feared. For the same reason, during the period when they failed to complete their swallowing and digestion, at least until New Year's Eve of 1940, the aggressors actually gained nothing. Therefore, although the aggressive arrogance was rampant during this year, even from the perspective of the aggressors, it was more harmful than beneficial. Indeed, the aggressors are looking forward to the final gains in the future, and the manpower and resources sacrificed at present are nothing more than investments. However, in this year alone, it has been proven that the aggressors will eventually fail.

One does not know the total profit and loss until the final reckoning. And the reckoning under different standards must find different views of profit and loss. For example, in the Sino-Japanese War, the Japanese side has consistently believed that it has won. Winning is, of course, a benefit rather than a loss. Until recently, some Japanese publicly pointed out that the war has not actually been won and concluded that it is impossible to defeat the National Government. This shows not only the difference in views between China and Japan but also the difference in views between the Japanese in the past and now. The differences in views are not a problem. Perhaps neither of them is accurate. However, there is something that cannot be disputed: First, after the tempering of 1940, the facts prove that Japan has lost its ability to launch large-scale offensives in the Far East. Not to mention the withdrawal from Guangxi, China has also gained the initiative to launch offensives on all fronts, and the strategy of harassing the Japanese army behind the lines has achieved great results. The direction of such changes in the situation and the manifestation of the ebb and flow of power could only be imagined in the past, but this year proved that it was inevitable. Therefore, although China suffered great damage from being invaded during this year, it has other benefits whose value cannot be estimated. Second, for six or seven years, due to the rise of Nazi Germany, the country has become strong, and its influence has made those who are concerned about the political system doubt that dictatorship is necessary for the prosperity of the country, and that democracy is not enough to contend with it. After the experiment of 1940, although the weaknesses of dictatorship have not been newly exposed, democratic countries only need to maintain the spirit of democracy, and if they cooperate from top to bottom, the national power they exert will be universal and extremely great, and because it is profound, it is extremely thick. In addition to China, Britain's saving of the decline and turning to take the upper hand, and the United States' implementation of the construction of unprecedented military equipment and "making the whole country a great military factory," can all prove that thorough democracy and strong armaments are not only not mutually exclusive but also complement each other. In contrast, it can be seen that dictatorial aggression is just the force of a tyrant. This was the theory of the past, and it is the fact of this year. Third, the highlight of the first half of 1940 was that France's faith wavered, so it sought peace from victory. The highlight of the second half of 1940 was that Greece used the small to defeat the large, the weak to defeat the strong, and the few to defeat the many, so it gained a strategic advantage. This is a situation that shallow scientists in the past would never have imagined. We will not ask whether the reason for the victory or defeat of the two countries of Greece and Italy is that Greece has its own way to win, or that Italy has its own way to fail? However, as long as the international aggressor adheres to the belief in resisting the war, the aggressor will encounter a head-on blow everywhere. In the past, the world regarded China's resistance as a miracle, but last year Greece again interpreted the reason for resolutely resisting the war on behalf of China. Fourth, in the past, Japan used the argument that China could not be unified and was easy to divide as one of the bases for deciding to invade China. This is because the Japanese side ignored the fact that those who are concerned with the great plan of the nation for a hundred years can always transcend politics and cope with the long term. This kind of neglect has indeed had lucky precedents in the international community. However, after the Japanese hit a wall in China, they did not blame themselves for the error in observation but falsely accused the Chinese people of not being strong enough in political ideas. It also imagined in the same way of observation that the United States' Far East policy would waver and change with the expiration of President Roosevelt's term. However, it did not know that when it came to the great plan of the American nation for a hundred years, the American people would rather abandon their political habits and support Roosevelt's unprecedented re-election for a third term. As a result, the United States' Far East policy was stronger than the Japanese had expected. This is another matter of 1940 and is enough to herald good omens in the future. From the above, it can be seen that although the international storms of 1940 were extremely bad, they were by no means completely deteriorated and have already bred some seeds of a bright future.

### Six-Year Opium Prohibition Plan Completed, Chairman Chiang Urges All Compatriots to Work Hard to Eradicate the Remaining Opium Poison, Do Not Abandon Previous Efforts, Anyone Who Plants, Transports, Sells, or Smokes Will Be Subject to the Highest Penalty

Chongqing - Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, for the completion of the six-year opium prohibition plan, specially issued a telegram urging all compatriots to intensify their efforts to eradicate the remaining opium poison and not abandon their previous efforts. He also warned all officials and people that those who plant, transport, sell, or smoke opium will be subject to the highest penalty. The original telegram said, "To all comrades of the Party, government, and military at all levels and to compatriots in all regions, the six-year opium prohibition plan was previously limited to the end of the year, and reports from all provinces and cities have been filed throughout the country. It was prohibited in advance this year, and at the latest, it was only until the end of September. At the same time, in the original plan, the opium addiction treatment institutions that should be gradually reduced in various places were also stopped supplying from October and thoroughly handled to an end. On this last day of the expiration of the opium prohibition period, all our comrades and compatriots throughout the country should be deeply vigilant, recognizing this as the greatest pivot for our people to get rid of the old and bring in the new. The spirit and physical strength of our 450 million compatriots should show the glorious brilliance of greatness from the first day of the 20th year of the Republic of China and move forward on the road to rejuvenation. Therefore, all our compatriots throughout the country, regardless of men, women, old, or young, should work harder to eradicate the remaining opium poison and must not abandon their previous efforts. Everywhere should be a plan for prohibition, and inspections must not be interrupted. Suspicions should also be thoroughly investigated. Regardless of planting, transporting, selling, or smoking, those who commit any of these offenses will be subject to the highest penalty, without exception. Those who rely on their power to harbor and protect criminals will be punished even more severely. Officials will use this as a basis for evaluation, and the people will use this to judge the good and the bad. To all comrades and compatriots in the occupied areas, you must crush the conspiracy of poisoning our people and strive to ensure that when the final victory is achieved, the national opium prohibition steps can be completed uniformly, setting an example for new citizens and advancing the national fortune to health and strength. All this depends on it. I wish you all to strive hard. Chiang Kai-shek (Telegram, 30th)"

### Zhang Weihan's Broadcast Yesterday: Six Years of Opium Suppression

Chongqing – Zhang Weihan, Vice Minister of the Interior, broadcast on the Central Broadcasting Station on New Year's Eve, (announcing the completion of the six-year opium suppression plan to compatriots nationwide). He stated briefly: This year is the final year of the six-year opium suppression plan, and today is the last day of the six-year phased opium suppression. The Ministry is responsible for the national opium suppression administration, and I would like to take this opportunity to provide a comprehensive report on the progress of opium suppression over the past six years and the future follow-up measures. The Central Political Conference resolved in the 24th year of the Republic to establish a National Opium Suppression Commissioner, concurrently held by the Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, to handle national opium suppression matters. The Opium Suppression Commissioner formulated a six-year opium suppression and two-year drug prohibition plan, and promulgated two provisional regulations on punishing opium suppression and drug prohibition, while suspending the application of Chapter 20 of the Criminal Law concerning opium offenses. The two-year drug prohibition plan was fully implemented by the 25th year of the Republic, and the six-year plan, under the leadership of Chairman and Opium Suppression Commissioner, was gradually advanced, resulting in great strength and remarkable achievements. After the outbreak of the war, the Chairman, in order to focus on military affairs, telegraphed in February of the 27th year to relinquish the concurrent position of Commissioner, transferring opium suppression affairs to the management of the Ministry of the Interior. The National Opium Suppression Association was reorganized into the Opium Suppression Committee of the Ministry of the Interior, and the responsibilities for opium transport and sales were transferred to the Ministry of Finance. This is a general overview of the evolution of opium suppression. Now, I will explain it in three parts: opium cultivation, opium transport, opium sales, and opium smoking. Opium cultivation, according to the provisions of the six-year opium suppression plan and the five-year progress schedule, the first priority is opium cultivation, because opium cultivation is the root of opium suppression. We first divided the opium-growing provinces into two categories: absolutely prohibited and phased prohibition. Absolutely prohibited provinces had already been completely banned, and phased prohibition provinces had also reached the stage of complete prohibition before the 28th year of the Republic. However, the bad habits of opium cultivation accumulated over many years are not easy to completely eradicate in a short time. The Ministry urged provincial and county governments to earnestly collect and destroy poppy seeds to eliminate the source of domestic illicit cultivation. During the opium seedling planting season, inspectors were dispatched at any time to investigate and eliminate any illicit cultivation, and to detain and severely punish opium growers according to the law. In the winter of the 28th year of the Republic, in order to improve the efficiency of opium cultivation suppression, a supervision group was specially organized in seven provinces (Sichuan, Kang, Yunnan, Guizhou, Shaanxi, Gansu, and Fujian), and inspectors were selected by the Ministry to participate in each group to carry out universal inspection and eradication. As a result, many opium seedlings were eradicated. In the autumn of the 29th year of the Republic, a supervision group was organized in five provinces (Kang, Yunnan, Guizhou, Shaanxi, and Gansu) to expand the scope of inspection and prohibition, and inspectors were dispatched to Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi, Henan, Suiyuan, and Ningxia provinces to inspect. Now, the provinces have been largely cleared. Opium suppression supervision groups and inspectors are stepping up their work, and it is expected that better results will be achieved.

Opium transport and sales, under the premise of phased opium smoking prohibition, smokers were allowed to temporarily smoke opium and gradually reduce consumption in order to achieve fundamental eradication. Therefore, there were regulations for licensed merchants to purchase opium and establish opium paste shops. On the one hand, the government centrally collected and cleared private opium stockpiles and strictly enforced the investigation and suppression of private transport. According to the phased progress schedule for opium transport and sales formulated by the Ministry of the Interior, by the end of the 29th year of the Republic, all transport and sales agencies in various places should be completely abolished. As of today, public warehouses and opium soil management agencies in various places have also been closed or abolished. All remaining opium should be burned or transferred to the Central Narcotic Drugs Management Agency to supply pharmaceutical raw materials. Therefore, from today onwards, except for raw materials specially licensed for pharmaceutical manufacturing, no one or any place in the country is allowed to have any opium, otherwise it will be illegal, and once discovered, it will be severely punished according to the law.

Opium smoking, according to the provisions of the six-year phased opium suppression plan and the five-year progress schedule, the so-called opium smoking prohibition is to implement cessation for existing opium addicts in various places in phases and batches. Since the 24th year of the Republic, several registrations have been held. As of the 26th year of the Republic, according to reports from various provincial and municipal governments, there were 4,160,285 opium addicts. In reality, some omissions are inevitable, especially since the war, people have been displaced, and the dynamics of opium addicts are even greater. In July of the 28th year of the Republic, another universal registration was conducted to issue new licenses free of charge, and the Ministry formulated temporary measures for provinces and cities to inspect opium addicts, which were circulated by the Executive Yuan to all provinces and cities for compliance. The inspection period was limited to three months. On the one hand, the equipment of opium cessation hospitals and opium cessation centers was expanded, and cessation was intensified, and opium addict factories were established, and measures were formulated to provide living relief during the opium cessation period for poor and laboring opium addicts. All provinces were required to have half of the opium addicts completely quit by the end of March of the 29th year of the Republic, and the remaining half completely quit by the end of June, and at the latest by September of this year. For those who have already quit and broken their addiction, sampling and verification should be carried out in phases and areas according to regulations, and a general inspection should be held. Except for a few provinces that requested to extend the cessation period to September or the end of December of this year, the remaining provinces were required to complete the cessation by the end of June. Now, we have received reports from various provinces that they have complied with the deadline. Although the six-year opium suppression deadline has expired, the follow-up problems are worthy of our special attention. The Ministry has formulated the 30th year opium suppression follow-up plan and measures to eliminate opium poison, which are being submitted for approval. We hope that compatriots nationwide will continue to support us with the same enthusiasm and the spirit of eliminating poison, work together, and deeply believe that we will be able to completely eliminate the remaining poison and complete the goal of national rejuvenation.

### Thailand Convenes Special Cabinet Meeting; Rumors of Japanese Plotting Coup in Thailand; Four Japanese Sent to Bangkok by Matsuoka to Incite Thai Army to Overthrow the Government; Large Quantities of Japanese Military Supplies Shipped to Thailand

Bangkok – After repeatedly stating its determination to reclaim the provinces of Cambodia and Laos from Vietnam, the Thai government has convened a special cabinet meeting. Although Thai official radio declared Thailand's determination to reclaim these two provinces, it did not indicate an expansion of its demands on Vietnam. The Thai Supreme Command also announced that there were no hostile incidents on the border yesterday. (30th United Press dispatch)

Hong Kong – United Press has learned from reliable sources here that while the Japanese are intensifying their pressure on southern Vietnam, they are also planning a major coup within Thailand. United Press also reports from reliable sources that Japanese and Wang Jingwei's special envoys are helping Thailand to engage in activities in southern Vietnam. Reliable sources also stated that they have received a communication from Tokyo to the Mitsui & Co. in Bangkok, which stated that four Japanese, under the guise of goodwill representatives, have set off for Bangkok. It is rumored that these four are under the instruction of Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka to incite a pro-Japanese coup in the Thai army. The Japanese are currently increasing their military assistance to the Thai army, including 33 fighter planes and 25 bombers. These planes were delivered to Thailand in mid-December. It is also rumored that the "Bangkok Maru" ship has departed for Bangkok with 995 tons of military supplies, guns, and ammunition. Another ship, carrying several tanks, is also preparing to leave Japan. It is said that while Japan and Thailand are jointly opposing France, the Vietnamese authorities are also doing their best to resist Japan's pressure on Saigon. Because Japanese military officers in Hanoi have recently been flying to Bangkok frequently, the Vietnamese authorities have had to suspend air travel from Vietnam to Bangkok to prevent espionage. However, the Japanese air route through Vietnam is still operating as usual. Reliable sources also said that the number of Japanese travelers in southern Vietnam has suddenly increased in recent days. Most of these travelers are trying to penetrate the French military areas of Cambodia and Laos. Major General Kakuta, the chief representative of the Japanese military delegation stationed in Guangzhou, also tried to enter the military zone during his recent tour of southern Vietnam, but was stopped. Reliable sources continued that the French had previously captured Japanese in the same city who were traveling in two cars, including eight military officers. These Japanese have all been escorted to Saigon. A letter was obtained by reliable sources, the content of which indicated Japan's plan to launch a coup to overthrow the existing Bangkok regime and establish a war party. This was told to United Press by someone who had read the letter. The letter also explained to Mitsui & Co. that the true mission of these four Japanese going to Thailand was to launch a coup and organize a pro-Japanese government. Well-informed sources also told the United Press reporter that the Mitsui & Co. personnel in the area are also a huge espionage organization, and includes personnel from the Wang Jingwei faction and natives operating in Vietnam. The Japanese air route that the French authorities suspended was a new route from Hanoi via Tourane, Saigon to Bangkok, while the Japanese were allowed to continue flying the remaining route. Thirty Japanese accompanied Major General Kakuta on his southern tour and were prevented from entering the military zones of Cambodia and Laos. (29th United Press dispatch)

### The United States Will Increase Aid to China and Britain Next Year: Observations of Prominent Chinese Scholar Zhang Zhongfu

Chongqing – Prominent international affairs writer Zhang Zhongfu published an article in the Central Daily News today, stating that the United States will increase aid to China and Britain in 1941. The Neutrality Act and the Johnson Act cannot prevent the United States from aiding democratic countries, and in fact, there is a possibility that both of these acts will be repealed or amended. Before the outbreak of war between the United States and Japan, the United States may not only prohibit exports to Japan and aid China, but also control imports to increase pressure on Japan. US military production will increase, and Britain's military equipment program will soon be completed. Its aircraft production will be comparable to, or even exceed, that of Germany. In this state, if war breaks out between the United States and Japan, Japan may be forced to withdraw most of its troops in China due to manpower and resources. Even if war between the United States and Japan does not occur, Japan is unlikely to make any further progress in China. The problems that China needs to solve next year are: (1) How to stabilize the domestic economic situation; (2) How to make effective use of material and financial assistance from friendly countries; (3) How to maintain international transportation routes; (4) How to adapt China's military actions to international developments. Although China may not be able to drive the Japanese army out of Chinese territory next year, it can be asserted that the opportunity for this development will not be far away. After explaining that war between the United States and Japan is inevitable, Zhang said that in the initial stage of the war, the United States will implement a naval blockade, attacking Japanese ships without attacking its mainland. Unless a revolution occurs in Japan, it is unlikely to collapse in 1941. However, the war between the United States and Japan will undoubtedly accelerate its collapse. Zhang was formerly the head of the Department of Political Science at Peking University and is currently a counselor to the Military Affairs Commission. (30th Reuters dispatch)

### Britain and Italy Actively Reinforce; Major War to Erupt in North Africa; British Bomb Naples Port; Five Italian Planes Shot Down in the Middle East

(Rome) Just as the Italian High Command declared victory in Albania and Libya today, Italian authoritative editor Ansaldo warned that a major war is brewing in North Africa. He pointed out that both Britain and Italy are rushing reinforcements to the Libyan border. "Both sides are taking advantage of the temporary lull in the Mediterranean war to accelerate preparations for the greatest decisive battle." Private transportation between Italy and North Africa has been stopped today, indicating that military activities have been stepped up. At the same time, an official communique announced today that due to the urgency of the war, all dividends will be reduced to 7 percent, and tax interest will increase from 10 percent to 20 percent. Today's Italian communique stated that Italian troops have won minor local victories in Albania and Libya. (30th International News Service dispatch)

(Cairo) Today's headquarters communique stated that the Italian artillery at Bardia has been silenced after continuous bombardment by the British navy and army.

Italian bombers also attacked Solum in retaliation, but Solum only suffered slight material damage. Roman radio station tried to make people distrust British war news, so yesterday the radio station pointed out that the British Broadcasting Corporation and Cairo published very different numbers of Italian aircraft destroyed, saying that the British Broadcasting Corporation reported that two Italian aircraft were lost, while Cairo reported twenty-four. However, according to responsible persons, Roman radio station said that only half of the facts were true, because it deliberately did not state that the two Italian aircraft mentioned by the British Broadcasting Corporation were destroyed on December 26, and the twenty-four aircraft announced by Cairo were the number of Italian aircraft shot down by a British team in the western desert in six and a half months of combat.

### Fierce Hand-to-Hand Combat North of Kimala; Greek Army Seizes Important Positions and Controls the Entire Southern Albanian Mountain Area

(Athens) It is heard that the Greek army advancing north of Kimala, after fierce hand-to-hand combat, has seized an important mountain position.

### Premier Luo's New Year Message to the Nation

(Rome) Romanian Prime Minister General Constantin Guddonascu issued a New Year's message to the public today. (Haitong Telegram, 30th)

(London) Last night, London experienced an unusually severe bombardment. German planes attacked in waves, indiscriminately dropping incendiary and high-explosive bombs. The bombs fell like rain. The extent of casualties and material damage is currently unknown. London issued an early warning last night. German planes also flew to a location in northeastern England and dropped bombs, causing some casualties. Some towns along the Suffolk coast and two towns on the Kent coast were bombed, destroying several houses, but no casualties were reported. In the week ending at midnight on December 28th, the Germans lost a total of seven planes in attacks on Britain. During the same period, British fighters suffered no losses, while British bombers lost five planes during extensive attacks on German territory and occupied areas. (Reuters Telegram, 30th)

(London) German planes concentrated their attacks on London last night in the most intense raid since September. The air raid began at 6:30 PM and ended at 10:00 PM, suggesting that the German military is adopting a strategy of short-duration attacks, or that the British air defense is particularly strong; one of these must be the case. The first planes dropped bombs over an area of the city of London, triggering a torrent of anti-aircraft fire. By 7:45 PM, the bombing intensified, resembling the devastation of September. By 8:45 PM, countless bombs and incendiary devices fell on a vast area. At 9:00 PM, the Associated Press reporter was forced to take shelter in a cellar for the first time since September. Afterward, buses and pedestrians gradually returned to the streets, though planes were still overhead and occasional bombs fell. By 9:30 PM, anti-aircraft fire diminished, suggesting that large numbers of British night fighters were engaged in combat overhead. Londoners heard intense machine gun fire in the sky. By 10:00 PM, all was quiet. (Associated Press Telegram, 30th)

(London) Last night's rare and intense bombing of London resulted in substantial material losses. Several large commercial buildings were partially destroyed. The historic City Hall was also slightly damaged, but the fires that approached the building were quickly extinguished. Although the city center suffered the most severe bombing, other areas were also hit and caught fire. Commercial buildings suffered significant losses. Authorities say the attack was intended to burn down the City of London. It is noteworthy that new buildings were able to withstand the impact. The most intense fires occurred in older buildings used as offices, as they contained a lot of dry wood. Another noteworthy feature was the calmness of the female ambulance crews, firefighters, and refreshment cart operators during the air raid. Even with bombs falling like rain, they continued to serve as usual, without retreating. As the attack reached its peak, anti-aircraft fire suddenly ceased, and Royal Air Force night fighters appeared in the sky, engaging the enemy in short bursts of combat. Then the anti-aircraft fire ceased again, for an even longer period, clearly indicating that the enemy planes had been driven away. A bomb shelter in a church, housing four hundred people, was hit by a bomb, but everyone inside escaped unharmed. (Reuters, 30th)

(London) As a result of the German Air Force's efforts to set fire to the center of London last night, six famous churches and a Guildhall were destroyed. The number of incendiary bombs dropped by the Germans in this operation was unprecedented. However, thanks to the courageous efforts of the fire brigade, the fires were brought under control by dawn. (Reuters Telegram, 30th)

(Dublin) Yesterday, planes of unknown nationality appeared over various parts of southern Ireland. Anti-aircraft guns fired into the air until the planes disappeared into the fog. (Reuters Telegram, 30th)

### Report of German Raider Preying in the Pacific, Using Japanese Ports for Supply, Posing a Major Threat to British Merchant Ships

(Washington) While reports from Manila about a German raider preying in the Pacific and using Japanese ports for supplies have not been officially confirmed, naval circles here generally believe it is highly plausible. The nation is paying close attention, and newspapers are giving it prominent coverage. Naval officials say they have not received official reports, and even if they had, they would not be able to comment on them. Unofficial naval sources say that the British Pacific fleet is weak and its shipping extensive. It is to be expected that Germany would try to extend its attacks to this area. Therefore, Germany could equip raiders in Japanese or Japanese-controlled ports, making them difficult to detect. Such covert actions are also impossible to prove, and there are many islands in the Pacific where ships can hide or replenish supplies. Many of these are crucial hubs for British shipping, so if this report is true, devising countermeasures is of utmost importance. (Associated Press Telegram, 30th)

(Tokyo) According to reports from Australia, three British ships in the South Pacific and four oil tankers off the Australian coast were sunk in late November. Australians believe this was the work of a second "Emden." According to rescued crew members, the ships were not attacked by submarines but by a cruiser displacing 8,000 tons. Therefore, Australians believe the German navy is also attacking British ships in the Pacific. It is said that the "Queen Mary" remains in a New Zealand port due to unsafe navigation in the South Pacific. (Haitong News Agency Telegram, 30th)

### Reasons and Duration of Italian Border Closure Not Announced; North African French Will Fight Again

Vichy It has been learned that, following the recent complete closure of the German-French border by German forces, the French-Italian border has also been closed by the Italian side. The reasons for and duration of the closure have not been announced. (Associated Press Telegram, 20th)

Ankara According to reliable sources cited by an observer here, if the Nazis attempt to force Marshal Pétain and the French colonies to fight against Britain, the French in Africa will rise up again and fight Germany until France regains its freedom. Vichy Air Minister General Puget recently stated frankly that the French in Syria and French territories will reject any attempts at foreign interference, and that the new governor of Syria has fully restored French authority in Syria. Other reliable sources also say that Marshal Pétain dismissed Laval because Laval was negotiating with the Germans to have French African colonies join the war against Britain. (Reuters Telegram, 30th)

Vichy Responsible sources here declared yesterday that reports of difficulties in German-French relations are merely propaganda. Naval Minister Admiral Darlan's visit to the occupied zone is a favorable move for German-French relations. French government special representative Brinon is also still in Paris. These reports are completely inaccurate. It is claimed that the recent cabinet meeting proceeded normally, discussing domestic policies related to the budget. The government has now appointed a budget committee to study the plans of various government departments. (Haitong News Agency Telegram, 30th)

### Pétain's Broadcast Address: Encouraging French Youth to Overcome All Difficulties; The Earth Will Surely Rejuvenate

Vichy Marshal Pétain delivered a radio address to the nation's youth tonight, saying: "I am well aware that you are suffering and anxious about the future. Although everything is dark now, it is certain that your efforts will bring back the light. The French people before you grew up in an unhealthy environment, lived a life of corruption and infatuation, and lost their courage, leading to an unprecedented catastrophe in history. For you, the situation is completely reversed, because you have learned to overcome various difficulties and do not want to live a life of drunken stupor and enjoyment. Therefore, I have high hopes for you. I have some advice to give you: when choosing a career, be careful of two temptations: first, do not covet ill-gotten wealth; second, do not seek easy work. On the contrary, all of you young people should study diligently and cultivate a good spirit of cooperation. You should know that true independence is completely consistent with discipline. In a word, even though we are in the depths of winter, we must believe that the earth will surely rejuvenate one day." (Havas News Agency Telegram, 29th)

Vichy Young men and women in various cities gathered this afternoon to listen to Marshal Pétain's radio address. They were tense. Afterward, they sang the French national anthem, "La Marseillaise." The phrase "sacred love of the motherland" is said to be a favorite of Marshal Pétain. (Havas Telegram, 29th)

### Germany Confiscates Large Quantities of Food from Norway

London It is reported that Germany is now transporting large quantities of food and other supplies from France and Norway to Germany, which are desperately needed by the people of those countries. In Norway, Germany has confiscated all meat. 50,000 sheep, originally intended for hospital patients during Christmas, were confiscated. Norwegian civilians cannot buy bacon or eggs. Germany not only takes food from Norway, but also relies on Norway and Belgium for its clothing. It is reported that stores in Norway and Belgium that sell textiles have been ordered by the Germans to close down during the New Year. After the New Year, the Germans will issue regulations adjusting the sale of clothing materials. (Reuters Telegram, 30th)

### Germany Controls European Economy; Three of Göring's Friends are Key Planners

Berlin The Nazi Party not only wants to control Europe militarily, but also believes that economic control should proceed simultaneously with military action, so that Hitler can control half of Europe. Among those who are trying to give Germany a commercial advantage through this two-pronged military and economic approach are three close friends of Air Minister Göring: Uhlert, Kirl, and Fischer Bock. The first two were ordinary businessmen and not old members of the Nazi Party. However, Air Minister Göring granted them all political and administrative power in propaganda and ordered them to jointly undertake various necessary activities to spread Nazi economic theory throughout Europe and form an economic "United States of Europe." Among these three, the most important is Uhlert, who is currently the French Commissioner of the Dutch Bank. The scope of his activities is far broader than his official duties. Uhlert played an important role in the negotiations that enabled Spoh to obtain Romanian oil supplies. The conclusion of the German-Romanian trade agreement not only allowed Germany to obtain Romanian oil, but was also the first step in Romania's abandonment of Britain and France and its embrace of the Axis powers. This alone shows Uhlert's importance. Kirl and Fischer Bock are also key figures in planning the Nazi economic organization, along with Uhlert. (Associated Press Telegram, 30th)

### Germany Plans to Demand Three Things from France, Using the Pretext of Cooperation to Pressure Vichy to Join the War

London The Times commented on the power struggle between Hitler and Pétain, saying that the things Hitler is now most strongly demanding from France are (1) ports in the Mediterranean, (2) remnants of the French fleet, and (3) most importantly, non-metropolitan bases. Mussolini's failures have made this need even more urgent. Hitler is now trying to obtain these three things under the guise of cooperation with France. Laval was an instrument of this policy, but this instrument has been restrained by Marshal Pétain's resolute action. Therefore, Hitler has found it very difficult. Germany does not dare to take further action against Marshal Pétain or openly violate the armistice terms. Its greatest fear is that this would provoke the French North African colonies. The colonies, having witnessed the defeat of the French army, are already eager to try. Further provocation will create a strong union of French Africa, fighting alongside Britain to resist Germany and liberate France. However, the public should not ignore the predicament of the French people due to Hitler's efforts. Their extremely weak resistance posture may cause Hitler to increase the pressure on France, making life even more unbearable for the French people than it is today. (Reuters Telegram, 30th)

### Difficult Living Conditions for Teaching Staff; Joint Relief Measures by Educational Organizations; Talk by the Education Union Calling on All Parties; Various Organizations Work Together to Overcome the Crisis

(Dahua News Agency) Since the price of rice has soared, salary earners in general have been severely affected, especially teachers at all levels of schools with meager salaries, who are barely able to feed and clothe themselves. As a result, there is a movement to demand improved treatment. The person in charge of the Municipal Education Association gave a detailed account of the situation as follows:

Since the beginning of this semester, the prices of all necessities for daily life have doubled. According to the statistics of the Shanghai Municipal Council, the cost of living index has reached more than five times that before the war. Coupled with the recent soaring prices of rice and coal, teachers' lives have been even more severely affected. The salaries of teachers at all levels of schools in the city have not only not increased after the war, but have actually decreased compared to before the war due to the huge expenses of the schools. For example, the salary of elementary school teachers is usually only about 30 yuan per month, and the salary of middle school teachers is only 60 or 70 cents per hour, which is much lower than that of coolies, hawkers, ticket sellers, and Chinese police officers. How can they maintain their daily lives with such low prices? Single people can barely feed themselves, let alone support their parents and raise their wives and children. Therefore, although teachers work hard all day long, they still cannot maintain the warmth of their families. This difficult and miserable situation is well known to all sectors of society. However, although teachers' lives are so poor, they have a sense of responsibility for cultivating talents. Coupled with the current national crisis, in order to seek the eternal liberation of the country and the nation, they can only endure personal temporary pain. Therefore, in recent years, they have been able to grit their teeth and struggle hard in difficult conditions at their respective posts. However, recently, because the pressure of life has become too severe, they have been forced to make demands for improved treatment. In addition to stating their sufferings to all sectors of society and calling for relief, they have also separately requested the Association to request assistance from the party and government. They have received sympathy and assistance from all sectors of society. At least they must be able to maintain a minimum standard of living in order to serve with peace of mind and continue to work. This is a general outline of the development of this movement for improved living conditions. Since the development of this movement, teachers at all levels of schools have been able to maintain close contact with the Association under the guidance of the Association, adopt a strict stance, use reasonable means, and make legitimate demands. Therefore, all sectors of society have been able to express concern and willingness to provide assistance, especially the press, such as the China and America Daily, the Zheng Yan Daily, and other newspapers, which have commented and supported, called for the promotion of a million-dollar relief campaign, or published special issues. The preliminary issues for improving the treatment of teachers and staff, such as increasing tuition fees to improve teacher treatment, making school finances public, and using school funds for schools, have been clearly announced by the education-related parties. They have also publicly announced to all schools that they can increase tuition fees by 20% to 50% in the next semester, and stipulate that at least 70% of the school's income, excluding rent, must be used for teacher salaries. The measures are concrete and practical. From then on, our teachers only need to work together to assist the administrative authorities of each school to find ways to implement them, which can slightly alleviate the current urgent needs.

Most of the personnel cases have already yielded results, and it is appropriate to inform the public, which is comforting. After the cases are discussed and implemented at today's meeting, the Association seems to have reached a conclusion on the reorganization work, etc. Then the discussion began, and the draft resolutions are recorded below. (1) Regarding the case of publicly selecting examiners for the list of employees sent by the hospital, it was resolved to publicly select Le Gengbao, He Wuliang, and Zhu Daxun to review the members of the three committees together, and those who receive salaries but do not work will leave their posts at the end of December of this year. (2) Regarding the uneven qualifications of the female teachers in the hospital, how should the case be assessed?

(3) Regarding the case of Jiang Julin's arrears of 300 yuan, it was resolved that in addition to deducting the payable advertising fee of 270 yuan, the insufficient amount should be strictly urged to be returned to clear the books.

### Finance: Foreign Banks Entering Foreign Exchange Market, Afternoon Situation Suddenly Tightens

The foreign exchange market yesterday saw no change in HSBC's listed rates. The unofficial market for British and American exchange rates softened after an initial easing, much to the surprise of operators. The morning session was characterized by an abundance of positions and a lack of buyers. The initial state of the afternoon market was similar. The situation changed as foreign banks became more interested in buying, while brokerage firms and a few speculators again expected declines, slightly curtailing purchases. As a result, prices tightened from their previous easing. The evening closing rates were 3 pence 515625 for British gold and 5.53125 yuan for American exchange, down 0.015625 and 0.03125 respectively from the previous weekend.

Chinese Merchants Sell Off January Contracts

The market opened with exchange rates for British to American, British to Shanghai, and American to British remaining unchanged. The American to Shanghai rate was up slightly, and the American to French rate saw no market activity. The Central Bank's listed rates for various currencies remained the same. Banks opened the spot selling price in the morning at 3 pence 53125 for British gold and 5.5625 yuan for American exchange, the same as the closing price from the previous Saturday. After the opening, Chinese merchant speculators entered the market to sell American exchange for January delivery. The British and American banks took in 5.59375 yuan, and the price had risen slightly. By 9:30 AM, HSBC's listed rates were announced with no movement, and the silver tax remained unchanged. After this, Chinese merchant banks all sought to sell, leading to an imbalance between supply and demand, and the market hardened. Chinese banks sold American exchange for the current month to British banks for 5.625 yuan. By the noon close, British gold was at 3 pence 546875, and American exchange was at 5.59375 yuan.

Hong Kong Electricity Also Keen to Purchase

In the early afternoon, the market remained stable amid a generally flat trend as Chinese banks and speculators continued to sell, and there was a brief period of easing. The British and American banks took in American exchange for the current month from Chinese banks, mainland banks, etc., for 5.59375 yuan to 5.625 yuan. However, foreign banks soon became very interested in buying, and Hong Kong Electricity also bought in small amounts, leading to a tightening of the situation. The evening closing rates for spot and current-month British gold were 3 pence 515625, and American exchange was 5.53125 yuan. Next-month British gold was 3 pence 484375, and American exchange was 5.5 yuan, down 0.015625 and 0.03125 respectively from the previous weekend.

Hong Kong British Exchange Rises Slightly

Hong Kong, December 30 (Monday) dispatch: The exchange market opened flat this morning. British, American, and Japanese exchange rates were all unchanged. Shanghai exchange spot rate fell by 3 yuan to 420 yuan (the noon closing rate from the previous Saturday was 423 yuan). At 11:00 AM, the market was flat. The Shanghai exchange spot rate rebounded by 2.5 yuan to 422.5 yuan. At 11:30 AM, the market was flat. All exchange rates were generally stable. The market opened flat at 2:30 PM. The British exchange spot rate was up 0.03125 to 1 shilling 3 pence. The forward rate remained at 1 pence 2 pence 96875. The Shanghai exchange spot rate continued to rise by 5 jiao to 423 yuan. The rest remained unchanged.

Tianjin British and American Exchange Also Eases

Tianjin, December 30 (Monday) dispatch: The exchange market opened flat this morning. Telegraphic transfers to London and New York were each up 0.03125. London was at 3 pence 84375, and New York was at 6.09375 yuan. Shanghai exchange fell by 1 jiao 3 fen to 90.012 yuan. The unofficial market for "Joint Notes" was unchanged, remaining at 85.65 yuan.

### Gold Market Rises and Falls Violently After Initial Retreat

The gold market yesterday was extremely volatile. After a sharp drop, there was a sudden rebound, causing the 6,400 yuan mark to be broken repeatedly, only to rebound immediately. Although the Gregorian New Year holiday is from tomorrow (January 1st) for three days, and today is only a half-day business, people are still uneasy. Furthermore, after an easing, the foreign exchange market suddenly tightened. In addition, gold shops, silver shops (exchange merchants), and securities firms, as well as Shanghai Western firms, aggressively sold off in the morning, only to return in the afternoon to buy, causing the price to fall from 6,490 yuan to 6,340 yuan at noon, then rebound to a high price in the afternoon, ultimately closing up a small 20 yuan at 6,480 yuan. Based on the January American exchange rate of 5.5 yuan, the price was 6,352 yuan, up 128 yuan. The total daily trading volume was 14,500 taels. The cash price was 40 yuan lower than the forward price, already a premium of 10 yuan. In the morning and afternoon, the Yinlou industry Bei Qing Yun and Fei Wen Yuan sold to gold shops Yong Feng, Da De Cheng, and Sheng Yuan, a total of several hundred taels. Jewelry gold was once listed at a premium of 10 yuan at 660 yuan. The official gold price was unchanged.

Sharp Decline in the Morning, Rebound in the Afternoon

From the morning, every tael (ten liang), the foreign exchange market tended to ease, and many were eager to close out positions, causing the price to plummet. The market opened at 9:15 AM, and the price had already fallen to 6,450 yuan, 50 yuan lower than the noon closing price from the previous Saturday. It then fell to 6,440 yuan. Silver shops suddenly came in to cover positions, and scattered interests saw an opportunity to push up the price, immediately causing a surge of 50 yuan to 6,490 yuan. Small money shops came to sell, and silver shops and securities firms were also eager to sell. As the foreign exchange market continued to ease, exchange merchants also kept selling short, and scattered interests also rushed to sell, causing the price to drop sharply, falling 115 yuan, retreating into the 6,400 yuan range, falling to 6,375 yuan. At that time, a certain money shop came back in to buy, and silver shops also came to collect at low prices, causing the price to rise to 6,428 yuan. However, as gold shops, securities firms, and Shanghai Western firms continued to sell, the decline became even steeper at noon, falling another 88 yuan to 6,340 yuan. The market closed at noon at 6,350 yuan. The market opened 20 yuan higher at 2:00 PM in the afternoon, reaching 6,370 yuan. Retail investors sold as low as 6,352 yuan. Later, it was heard that the foreign exchange market was softening, triggering a buying spree. Securities firms, gold shops, and silver shops, which had aggressively sold in the morning, suddenly returned to buy, and short positions were quickly covered, causing the price to soar by 138 yuan, reaching 6,490 yuan. Shortly before closing, the price was 6,480 yuan, 20 yuan lower than the noon closing price from the previous Saturday. There was a fluctuation of 150 yuan throughout the day. The selling price of gold shops' official gold was about 10 yuan lower than the forward price, and the buying price was 40 yuan lower than the selling price. The current price for spot gold was still unavailable.

Jewelry Gold Also Fell and Rebounded

The selling price of jewelry gold per liang by Da Tong Hang and Xin Tong Hang was discounted by 10 yuan at 9:30 AM, reaching 650 yuan. By 4:00 PM in the afternoon, it had rebounded by 7 yuan to 660 yuan, breaking even. The buying price was reduced by 30 yuan.

### Foreign Currencies Fall and Rise Again

Yesterday, the foreign currency market saw the speculative price first fall and then rise, ultimately trending slightly downward. British and American gold quotes once fell by 3 yuan, ultimately falling by only 5 jiao. The British gold rate remained fixed. The market price was stable. The American gold rate fluctuated. In the morning, it fell from 18.2 yuan to 17.85 yuan, ultimately rising to 18.1 yuan, a fall of 1.2 jiao from the previous Saturday. The supply of Hong Kong notes was strong, and the market price continued to decline. The supply of Japanese gold notes and Korean notes was very large, especially Korean notes. The market price fell sharply, with the former falling to 1.595 yuan and the latter falling to 1.29 yuan.

### Discount Rate Drops Slightly

Yesterday, the discount rate for bills of exchange continued to decline. The discount rate per thousand yuan has gradually decreased to two yuan for discounting and two and a half yuan for discounted, down one yuan from the previous Saturday. The interbank lending rate of the Money Industry Association rose by one point, with both morning and noon markets listing at eight points.

### Yarn and Cotton: Selling Off and Shorting Again, Cotton Yarn Plummets, Double Horse Falls by More Than 30 Yuan, But Afternoon Sees a Rebound

The yarn market is weakening, and the decline is quite sharp. Although the foreign exchange market is stable and rebounding, the gold market's sharp decline has weakened confidence. Generally, scattered interests have risen up, turning long positions into short positions. At the same time, rumors are spreading that "foreign clients" are selling off. As a result, opinions are divided, and the market is unable to support itself. In fact, the previous consecutive increases have been large, and with any correction, those who have made profits will sell. In addition, the end of the year is approaching, and after closing out positions, future strategies will have to wait until next year.

The opening situation for Double Horse yarn was still favorable in the morning, with the initial price at 1,396 yuan. However, as long positions were slightly closed out, the price fell to 1,381 yuan, before rising again. Subsequently, it was heard that foreign exchange rates were showing a slight increase, and the gold market was falling sharply. As a result, speculators clamored loudly and sold off unanimously. The market gradually declined, and around 12:00, the selling pressure increased. In general, everyone turned long positions into short positions, and the market closed at 1,359 yuan. It was found that the trading volume for the half-day was 5,890 bales. The price of 20-count Double Horse yarn fell by 33 yuan. The quantity purchased by each group is listed on the left:

Hong Kong 350 Ningbo 30

Xiamen 10 Total 5,890

The yarn market turned upward in the afternoon due to the foreign exchange market tightening and the gold market rising. Therefore, buyers were active. 20-count Double Horse yarn initially traded at 1,356 yuan, then gradually rose to 1,367 yuan, with a trading volume of about one to two hundred bales. Recently, the yarn market has been extremely volatile, with a decline of 70 to 80 yuan in the past two days.

### Cotton Trading to Wait Until After the Holiday

The current situation for cotton is showing a slight improvement, as overseas Indian and American cotton markets are gradually rising. At the same time, the outlook for the yarn market is not considered to be small. Therefore, those holding goods are determined and unwilling to let go. As a result, although business is not prosperous, market prices are firm and stable with no changes.

Another report states that the price of foreign cotton, the New York cotton market is quiet. The market rose slightly later due to purchases by fellow traders and good spot transactions. The high prices of Wall Street stocks are also a factor in the rise of the cotton market. As a result, closing prices were higher than the previous day.

Foreign cotton trading in Shanghai has been very quiet in recent days. The sudden ups and downs of exchange rates have caused people to feel confused. In addition, the holiday is coming soon, and everyone is preparing to wait until after the holiday to discuss trading again.

### Piece Goods: Due Date for Advances, Many Longs Eager to Unload

Factory Cloth: Yesterday's market declined, which was due to the fall in yarn prices, a weakening of confidence, and the need to repay loans due at the end of the month. Many longs were eager to sell first, and there were few wholesale purchases. As a result, the selling pressure increased, and white goods, coarse and fine cloth, and twill each fell by 0.25 to 0.5 yuan per piece. Some bleached and dyed cloth fell by 0.5 yuan per piece. Over three hundred pieces of various cloth were traded on the street. Merchants from Zhejiang, Ningbo, and Taiwan bought over one hundred pieces of coarse and fine cloth, colored cloth, and pongee. Merchants from Fujian and Guangdong bought over three hundred pieces of coarse cloth and bleached and dyed cloth. Over three thousand pieces of bleached and dyed cloth were purchased from Singapore and other foreign countries.

Eastern Cloth: First declined and then rebounded, ultimately falling slightly. The morning market saw strong selling pressure from retail investors due to year-end lending and the continued decline in yarn prices, and the decline was quite sharp. Longtou fine cloth once reached 40.56 yuan. In the afternoon, spot gold rebounded, and new buyers were enthusiastic, gradually pushing prices up to 41.4 yuan at closing. There were rumors that the factory would increase warehouse rent for Four Gentlemen broadcloth, with new and old orders. The market was very weak, but the market also saw a slight rebound later. Sales opened at 1.165 yuan.

Exports: Today (December 31st), there are sixty pieces of cotton cloth being shipped to Yantai.

### Food: Large Quantities Arriving Daily, Imported Rice Slightly Weak

The imported rice market and daily rice market has been weak due to the strict enforcement of supervision. Trading has been light. Yesterday, prices for spot and forward contracts continued to decline in all grades. The situation was weak because the general Hakka people, at the end of the year, felt that they could no longer cut corners. In addition, due to the credit crunch, they were in urgent need of funds. Therefore, many opened up their holdings in time. On the sales side, general retailers, due to watching and waiting for several days without buying, felt that their inventory was weak. Furthermore, it was heard that the market would be closed for two days during the New Year's Day holiday. Therefore, they conspired to replenish their stocks. For a while, buying and selling were quite active. However, shipments have been arriving in Shanghai in succession in recent days. There are currently five or six hundred thousand bags waiting to be unloaded, and there are also various batches that can be transported to port. The new transactions, due to the rebound in exchange rates, have fixed prices. Yesterday, a new transaction was completed for 1,800 tons of Tavu's immediate loading of small grain, with a price of only 83.5 yuan. Trung's Saigon No. 1 for February loading was priced at 94 yuan. It is also rumored that Chin Wah and Kin Yuen have also agreed to transactions for Saigon No. 1 rice at 99 and 96 yuan. With both arrivals and orders strong, confidence suddenly weakened, and many long positions were eager to close out quickly. Therefore, lower grades of spot goods were sold at the fixed price. There were also rumors of discounts in the market. Saigon No. 1 opened at the fixed price of 87 yuan, No. 2 at 81.5 yuan, Huo Jiao at 86 yuan, Xiao Jiao at 79 yuan and 78.5 yuan, Mi Lai at 78 yuan, Sui Jian at 76 yuan, Cizhi Xi at 65 yuan, and Wuhu Jian at 80 yuan and 79.5 yuan. The trading volume was no less than ten thousand bags. The situation has become much weaker than before. The Ying Hua Division opened the price for February shipments of Xiao Wen at 85.3 yuan to 84.58 yuan, and for January shipments of Saigon at 100 yuan. There were also transactions for 400 tons of No. 2 for January 4th arrival at 82 yuan. 6,000 bags of spot rice were traded.

Large quantities of imported rice arrived in port yesterday. The Norwegian merchant Hua Lun Ocean Line's Da Lun, directly loaded from Saigon, arrived with 56,320 bags. It arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning and docked at the Pudong Hong Sheng wharf for unloading. Also, Taikoo Company's An Wei vessel, transported 1,522 bags from Hong Kong, arriving at port yesterday at noon and docking at the Bund wharf in the French Concession for unloading. (Zu)

Thick and Thin Japonica Rice: Yesterday, the path for thick japonica rice was still flat. This was because the price was expensive, and retail sales in stores were sporadic, leading to few purchases. The market price was difficult to support. Kunshan Prefecture's price for white japonica was 98 yuan to 96 yuan, and a special grade was 100 yuan. As for thin japonica rice, the market supply was limited, and the selling price was relatively cheap, not much different from imported rice. The buying interest was quite good, and the market was stabilized, without any ups or downs. Qingjiao Prefecture's price for thin japonica was still 92 yuan to 90 yuan.

Glutinous Rice: With the time for advancement orders and consumption, there was continued brisk sales from cake shops and food vendors. However, the market has a large stockpile of imported glutinous rice, so cargo owners are unable to increase prices. Both domestic and imported glutinous rice show a flat trend, and prices are similar to before.

### Fixed Arrivals Uninterrupted, Imported Flour Continues to Weaken

Flour: Yesterday, the imported flour market continued to weaken. This was because fixed orders and solicitations are uninterrupted, and new transactions have been completed for several batches of Campbell and Australia flour. The end of the Gregorian New Year is approaching, and those who are hoarding stop buying and start selling. The intake on this street is more active, but the number is limited. The total market volume for brands such as Hua Niao Zhong Lou was 12,000 to 3,000 bags. Hua Niao opened at 22.5 yuan, then quickly eased to 22.4 yuan and 22.43 yuan, down by 1 to 2 jiao from before. It is said that the high-grade goods of the Fort brand still require more than 23 yuan. There were also two to three hundred bags traded on this street. The Hua flour mill's market continues to maintain for only one day. A new approach will be discussed again next year.

Imported Flour Shipped Inland: Today, over seven thousand bags of Australian flour are being loaded onto a foreign vessel to be shipped to the mainland today. Wheat trading yesterday was still in a depressed state. Due to the scarcity of domestic and foreign supply sources, flour mills want to buy but have no goods, and can only wait and see for an opportunity. However, the market remains stable amid quiet conditions. There is no hope for any expansion in wheat trading this year.

### Securities: Public Bonds Temporarily Stalled

External Stocks Fluctuating Indefinitely: The unofficial market for public bonds was coming to an end as the year end approached. Many longs and shorts were mostly waiting for the red market to see what the ultimate changes would be in the future. However, before the opening, no speculation could reach a conclusion. Everyone has their own point of view. Shorts are wary of interest rate concerns, while longs dare not be bold due to the large changes in the environment. At this time of year, most are watching and waiting, so trading has been greatly reduced. Market prices are stable. Yesterday's transactions included Xie Da, Wu Yuan, and Ren Chang buying Lian Yi, advancing first and then retreating. Hong Da retreated first and then advanced. Tian Sheng, Tong Kang, Shun Chang, and Sheng Da all had sales. The trading floor was quite cold. Market prices ended slightly higher by about one jiao. The trading volume was eighty to ninety million yuan. A simplified table is listed below.

Stock trading: Two hundred shares of a Trust Company were traded at 18.5 yuan, a sharp increase from before.

Also, the opening of the late market at the Zhong Ye Public Institute was fluctuating. After entering, several well-known stocks gradually turned upward, while the rest were stable. Enterprise, Jardine Brewery, Wheelock Marden, Iron and Steel, and Xiang Tai stocks, which had seen large sales in the early stages, were mostly absorbed. As a result, prices rose straight up. At the close, almost all of the above-mentioned stocks had risen to new highs. Rubber stocks were stable and solid. The trading range for each stock yesterday was unprecedented in a long time.

### Ye Guang Real Estate Company

Redeems 6% Debentures

The British commercial Ye Guang Real Estate Co., Ltd. resolved at a board meeting yesterday to redeem the 6% company debentures issued in 1931 on June 30, 1941, totaling 3 million taels of standard silver.

### Miscellaneous Grains: Oil Beans Continue Downward Trend

The oil bean cake and miscellaneous grain market has seen rampant speculation recently, but it began to weaken slightly yesterday. This was because the end of the Gregorian New Year, and the market has a customary three-day holiday during the New Year, so the speculative range is narrow, and interest is lacking. Due to this lack, selling and buying are both lacking. Market prices continued downward in the driving environment. Yellow beans fell by half a yuan, and trading was sparse. Only 150 bags of Tianjin beans were opened at a price of 38 yuan, and 100 bags of Chongming Sha Huang were opened at a price of 35.5 yuan. The oil market fell by 1.5 to 2.5 yuan. Fifty pieces of Jiaozhou crude oil were opened at a price of 90 to 89 yuan. Three hundred tins of Yantai canned crude oil were priced at 119.5 yuan. Five hundred tins of Jiangbei native-style crude oil were priced at 125 tins. Two hundred dan of Da You factory oil were priced at 90 to 89 yuan. Forty barrels of Dalian soybean oil were priced at 113.5 to 113 yuan. Also, 200 barrels for January delivery were priced at 114.5 yuan to 113 yuan. 400 barrels for February delivery were priced at 117 yuan to 115.25 yuan.

### Silk and Tea: Japanese Silk Smuggled to Shanghai, Profits of Over 2,000 Yuan

The Yokohama silk market was closed yesterday due to the New Year's holiday. New York was also closed. News from the local market was quite quiet. Silk prices may be expected to rise after the New Year, but no one is willing to sell lightly before the New Year.

As for foreign markets, there is no sign of price increases. On the contrary, it is said that domestic prices in Japan are lower than the maintenance price, with 83-grade silk at 1,370 yuan and 78-grade silk at 1,150 yuan. Therefore, it is heard that Japanese silk is being smuggled to Shanghai, because selling in Shanghai can fetch over 2,000 yuan more than in Tokyo (calculated at the Japanese-American exchange rate). The reports of Japanese silk coming to Shanghai are quite close to the truth.

Such transportation is very profitable for Japanese silk merchants. Raw silk is controlled in Japan. Smuggling it out can fetch a high price and earn foreign exchange to protect their assets.

### Sugar Market: Large Buyers Taking in, Dutch Red Sugar Sees Greatest Increase

With the Gregorian year end approaching and inventories very thin, most people are planning to take in stocks, so prices have rebounded. The increase is very strong. According to the Association's price quotes, spot for 24 coarse white sugar from the foreign warehouse is 79 to 79.5 yuan. Invoicing on January 15 is 79.5 to 80 yuan, up 0.5 yuan. The price for Dutch cotton white BS mark is 77.5 to 77.8 yuan. Spot for Dutch red sugar initially was 64.8 yuan, then 65.5 yuan, then 66 yuan, up 1.8 yuan. Invoicing on January 15 is 65.5 to 66.5 yuan, up 2 yuan. Taikoo opened a price for 800 tons of coarse granulated white for January shipment at US$3.175, slightly higher than before according to C.I.F. terms. Taikoo's car white B mark is 78.6 to 79 yuan. Invoicing on January 20 is 79.2 to 79.5 yuan, up about 1 yuan. DY mark is 76.8 yuan, then rose again to 77.2 to 77.5 yuan. HX mark is 76.8 to 77.4 yuan, up 0.9 to 1 yuan. H mark car red sugar rose from 62 yuan to 62.5 to 63 yuan. Because coarse white sugar is rising, rock sugar is also rising accordingly. No. 1 rock sugar is 101 yuan, and Ming rock sugar is 102 yuan, up about 4 yuan from the 20th. Also, 13,450 bags were transported from Hong Kong yesterday.

### North-South Goods: Black Fungus Arrivals Are Scarce, Prices Rise by 60-70 Yuan

Recently, black fungus has seen continued shortages of supply. Plus, market inventories are thin. Cargo owners are holding firm and selling little. As a result, Gao He Kou fungus has opened at 565 yuan, a rise of 60-70 yuan from before. Gao Chuan fungus cargo owners still have no intention of selling. Yesterday, small packages of mail fungus were sold for 500 yuan. The market is likely to tighten again.

### Lily Bulbs Continue to Rise

Lily bulbs are short in supply and inventory. According to letters from the production area, there are only a few hundred bags of inventory. Sales will continue until July of next year before new crops can be seen. It is expected that there will be a risk of stockouts. Therefore, the market has recently risen by 3 yuan. The market called for another 7 yuan increase yesterday. Although there has been no set price, it is bound to rise.

### Coal: Tong De Li Coal is Expensive and Popular

Tong De Li white coal, due to competition from peers last week, the market's unofficial price once retreated to 233-234 yuan. A large quantity was released. Later, due to the urgent announcement of foreign exchange, the quantity decreased. At the same time, the number of vouchers from managers and firms were also limited, and the market was exceptionally lively. Yesterday, peers were already quoting 240 yuan for the price. The shop at the front street is still selling screened coal at 248 yuan per ton, and there has been no further change.

### Hardware: Galvanized Iron Rose by Over 10 Yuan

Six-foot and seven-foot galvanized iron sheets on the market have seen prices rise due to scarce output from factories, no overseas shipments arriving, and limited local stock. This has caused panic in the market. Peers who have a small amount of spot goods are reluctant to sell easily. Therefore, the standard price has soared again and again. Yesterday, three-foot and six-foot colored sheets were selling for 9.5 yuan per sheet, while three-foot and seven-foot sheets required 10.8 or 10.9 yuan per sheet.

### Hui Si Iron's Arrival and Sales are Both Scarce

Hui Si Iron relies solely on local stocks for trading due to insufficient overseas supply. However, customers from other ports, such as Tianjin, Qingdao, Yantai, and the Yangtze River, have not yet started to purchase, so sales are also limited. The market is sustained only by transactions from local can factories, toy factories, printing factories, cigarette factories, and biscuit companies. Therefore, the industry's confidence has not dared to become too strong. Only the current situation is firm due to the impact of foreign exchange restrictions, and the selling price is flat. Yesterday, each box of 200-pound old steel factory products was selling for 175 yuan, while new steel factory products were quoted at 165 yuan per box.

### Suppressing and Stabilizing Prices Depends on Cooperation Between the Two Concessions, Assisting Merchants in Automatically Setting Prices, and Exerting Efforts to Smooth the Supply of Goods; the Price Investigation Office Explains the Reasons for Not Being Able to Set Price Limits

In order to crack down on hoarding and prevent abuses in the grain trade, the Municipal Council established a Price Investigation Office in August of this year, appointing Dr. Betterson of the Health Department to head it. Its task was to collect wholesale prices of goods and price differences of major items, investigate the profits earned from sales, and provide information on different selling prices of the same item. Since its establishment, it has adjusted price increases in stores in many cases. In addition, it has filed 187 prosecutions for violations of Municipal Council Notice No. 5233 and insufficient weighing equipment.

The Price Investigation Office has recently submitted a general report to the Council. The report recommends that the Council continue to cooperate with the French Concession authorities, assist merchants in automatically setting prices, and make every effort to smooth the supply of goods in order to solve the problem fundamentally, but does not advocate mandatory price limits. The reasons are as follows:

Too Broad in Scope, Unable to Implement

(1) The scope of this issue is quite broad, and the types of laws that can be applied to the Public Concession are diverse. The Council cannot forcibly limit prices and expect to achieve practical results.

Import of Goods Subject to Restrictions

(2) The high prices in this port are due to the fact that the outskirts of Shanghai are under military control, resulting in various restrictions on the normal import of goods. As for whether these restrictions are due to military necessity, it is irrelevant to the main point. In any case, the fundamental solution to this problem cannot be achieved without the assistance and goodwill of the Japanese army.

Currency Value Affects, Unable to Control

(3) The devaluation of the national currency directly affects imported goods and indirectly affects domestic goods. The Council cannot implement any attempt to control this situation.

Reasonable Profit Difficult to Stipulate

(4) It is a fact that the Council cannot stipulate the reasonable profits that importers and wholesalers should obtain. It is futile to only control retail prices. Competition among peers and the common sense of buyers will make the hoarding of retail stores lose its importance.

Must Have Two or More Prices

(5) If fixed prices are implemented for each vegetable market and store, each same item must have two or more prices according to the location, grade, and necessary expenses of each store.

The above report has been approved and accepted by the Municipal Council Board of Directors.

### The Great Anti-Japanese Reconstruction Project is Nearing Completion; National Flag to be Flown on New Year's Day to Mark the Occasion; No Major Extravagance Due to Extraordinary Times; Normal Precautions and Curfew in the Concession

Tomorrow is the New Year's Day of the 30th year of the Republic of China, and also the anniversary of the founding of the Republic of China. All circles in this port will have holidays and enthusiastically celebrate by flying flags. At that time, the national flag of the Blue Sky, White Sun, and Red Earth will be displayed throughout the city. However, in view of the extraordinary times, there will be no extravagant celebrations. All circles will stick to their posts, support national policies, and actively promote economical national construction savings, donate cold clothes, help refugees, and raise money for the New Year to comfort the front lines, to welcome the early arrival of light. The police authorities of the two concessions will take precautions from New Year's Eve, increase police patrols and investigate the security situation, and the traffic on the roads in each area will not be blocked. The curfew will be implemented as usual.

### Food Cooperative Association, Small Amount Collective Purchase Method, Association Constitution Revised and Announced

Establishing a public warehouse to store 200,000 bags of grain, it was originally scheduled to formally establish a small group committee of public warehouse storage at 3:00 pm today in the Council Chamber of Jiangxi Road. According to relevant sources, as of 5:00 pm yesterday, no formal notification of the convener had been received. Due to insufficient preparation procedures, the meeting may be postponed.

Food Cooperation Association Constitution

The Shanghai Food Cooperation Association constitution consists of eight articles as follows:

(1) The purpose of this association is to promote the collective purchase of small amounts of food, increase consumption cooperation and reserves, so as to reduce the burden of life. (2) The members of this association are divided into two types: basic members and ordinary members. (A) Basic members are divided into two types: individuals and organizations. Individual members pay 100 yuan or more into the association's fund. Commercial firms, factories, organizations, and other group members pay 500 yuan or more into the association's fund. (B) Ordinary members are limited to individuals, and each person pays 20 yuan into the association's fund. (3) Each 100 yuan of the fund paid by the basic members is used to purchase one bag of foreign rice or other food of equal value. Ordinary members purchase one bag of foreign rice or other food of equal value per person. Members who do not wish to purchase food can do so at their convenience, and their fund is used for advances required for entrusted purchasing food from the outside. (4) This association accepts the entrusted purchase of food from non-members, with the principle of assisting the purchase of small amounts of food. For those who order 1 to 5 bags of foreign rice, 1/4 of the price will be pre-charged. For those who order 6 to 20 bags of foreign rice, 2/3 of the price will be pre-charged. For those who order more than 20 bags of foreign rice, 1/2 of the price will be pre-charged. If ordering other food, this principle will also apply. (5) If the amount required for members and non-members to order food exceeds the amount paid by them, interest will be charged separately on the advance payment. (6) The funds paid by members cannot be used to offset the price of grain. No interest will be refunded upon dissolution. (7) The interest on the funds paid by members will be used to cover office expenses. If there is a surplus, it will be distributed in proportion to the amount of the fund, but the number of installments shall not exceed 1/10 of the fund. (8) When the funds paid by members are insufficient to purchase the amount of food required, borrow advances from enthusiastic people in the society, and give appropriate interest. Advances are divided into fixed-term and temporary types. Fixed-term advances are for a period of three months. The term for temporary advances is negotiated. After the period, the lenders can recover their advances in full.

Brokers Request to Enter the Rice Market Again

Grain transactions improved yesterday because a huge amount of foreign rice will arrive. Coupled with the imminent New Year's Day, all rice prices have fallen by about one yuan since yesterday morning. As for the Shanghai Rice and Grain Evaluation Committee's announcement that rice brokers are temporarily prohibited from entering the market for two weeks starting from the 25th of this month, the Rice Brokers Association has written to the committee requesting that it be withdrawn and that rice brokers be allowed to resume their brokerage activities. Fortunately, it has not been approved. However, some rice brokers, with ulterior motives, falsely claim to be representatives of firms and secretly become active in the market, which is illegal. It is hoped that the Rice Evaluation Committee and relevant authorities will pay attention to this. It is rumored that the Rice Brokers Association once sent Cai Weixiang, Shao Qingfu, and other directors of the association to negotiate with the person in charge of the Rice Evaluation Committee, and it is said that they have obtained the committee's permission to enter the market after the National New Year (4th). This statement is probably not accurate, and the Rice Evaluation Committee will not risk violating regulations.

### Japanese Military Police in Xujiahui Open Fire and Wound Chinese Workers, Suffering Two Gunshot Wounds, Very Serious; Japanese Authorities Strengthen Precautions in Various Places

According to news from yesterday morning (the 30th), the Japanese military police in the Xujiahui area are implementing precautions in the area. A Chinese worker was shot by the Japanese military police search team because he did not comply with the Japanese precautions, suffering two gunshot wounds and seriously injured.

Strict Precautions and Searches in Various Areas

At the same time, the Japanese authorities in Shanghai have adopted strict precautions in all areas under their jurisdiction to prevent terrorist incidents during the current holiday. Chinese people in the Hongkou area are all subject to strict searches by Japanese patrols and sentries when crossing bridges. The same applies to cars and buses. At the same time, the Japanese army and navy have now dispatched patrol teams to patrol back and forth in the Hongkou and northern areas of the Public Concession. Reliable sources believe that since the end of August, the Japanese army and navy personnel in Shanghai have been assassinated many times, and a total of 13 people have been killed. All of them were done by a secret party. The party may have the goal of assassinating 20 people within the year. The Japanese authorities are also aware of this, so they have implemented stricter precautions in the areas they occupy than before.

### American Evacuation is Imminent; Women and Children Belonging to American Churches Decide to Return Home

Yesterday, it was rumored in the market that the situation in the Far East has suddenly become tense. Germany is preparing to spread the war to the Pacific and hopes that Japan will immediately fight the United States. President Roosevelt also made a broadcast speech, firmly stating that he would do his best to help China and Britain to defeat the Axis powers, which is enough to show that a war between Japan and the United States is inevitable. After hearing this news, the Americans in this port have also changed their past calm attitude and are paying close attention to the future. Two hundred American missionaries and their children will return to the United States on the President Coolidge wheel in the New Year. They are almost all women or children under the age of sixteen. The American church is the fastest to handle the evacuation of overseas Chinese, and has sent all the women and children belonging to the church back to the country. The decision is the Joint Christian Missionary Association. The evacuation of women and children is also ready. There are only four women and seven children who have not yet decided whether to leave Shanghai next month. The evacuation of church workers is progressing very slowly. Most missionary families are scattered in the interior, and it is impossible to gather them immediately. It is said that the expenses for their evacuation this time are all self-funded and no assistance has been requested from the government. After the first notice was issued, most missionaries were unwilling to abandon their duties, but since then they felt that the international situation was becoming increasingly serious. In order to express their cooperation with the government, most of them returned to their country or prepared to return to their country, and the rest also expressed their willingness to evacuate, but those in the free Chinese area have never considered this matter.

### Strike of Workers at Guangci Hospital, Hoping for a Quick Resolution; More Than 400 Patients Directly Affected

Guangci Hospital on Jin Shenfu Road in the French Concession was established by the Catholic Church and sponsored by the French Municipal Council, so it is large in scale and covers a very large area. There are 150 beds in the first, second, and third class wards, 450 beds in the ordinary wards, more than 100 beds in the obstetrics department, a total of 190 male orderlies, more than 100 female servants, more than 40 nurses, and 400 staff doctors. Previously, due to high prices and increasingly difficult living conditions, representatives such as Jin Kuansheng were sent to the hospital director Van Elden (French), a priest, to petition and propose eight methods such as salary increases. According to the reporter of the Shewen News Agency, after the conditions were proposed, the hospital authorities stated that they were short of funds and could not approve them. Because the hospital formally rejected the workers' demands, they also expelled the representatives Mao Bin, Yuan Xinglin, and others, and went on strike at 4:30 pm yesterday. At the same time, because they were not allowed to stay in the hospital, all of them withdrew from the hospital. When the strike was implemented, the French police received the news and urgently dispatched a large team of Chinese and foreign detectives to maintain order. However, according to the reporter, there are more than 400 patients in the hospital. After the strike of all the hospital staff, these patients will be directly affected. It is hoped that the authorities will resolve the matter as soon as possible.

### Japanese Merchant's Runner Severely Injured by Chopping, Seeking Treatment at Baolong Hospital

He went to Baolong Hospital for treatment. The reason for the chopping is unknown. The police are currently investigating.

Their thirteen-year-old son told Western reporters about the robbery at the time, as if there were still lingering fears.

### Municipal Public Works Bureau Documents Not Successfully Moved by Japanese; Guard Insisted on Not Allowing, Arguing for a Long Time; Gateman Arrived and Moved the Documents Back Inside

The documents of the Shanghai Municipal Public Works Bureau are stored in the office on Qiqi Road and Fulvli Road and have been guarded by personnel sent by the Chinese government for several years. On the night of (29th), a team of Japanese went to the house, hoping to forcibly seize these documents unsuccessfully. It is heard that these Japanese arrived at the house storing the documents at about 7:00 pm the night before, claiming to go and move the documents and hand them over to the "Municipal Government." They argued with the guard for a long time and moved ten boxes of documents from the house to the middle of the road. Finally, a private gateman arrived to stop them, not allowing the documents to be moved away, and moved them back inside. However, it is generally expected that the Japanese will continue to try to seize these documents in the next few days. The French Concession police authorities stated yesterday morning (the 30th) that there were some "abnormal activities" at 172 Qiqi Road (the Tuberculosis Prevention Association is located in this house) the night before, but a police officer said that he did not know if any items were moved out of the house or any disturbances occurred.

### Meritorious Policemen of the French Police Given Bronze Medals

The French Concession will award the Public Council bronze medal to the following two people in accordance with the resolution of December 27 this year: (1) Western Police Alexander Robbie of the Police Department, because the police officer encountered a suspicious Chinese man on the road on December 19 this year, holding a gun aimed at his chest to threaten him, and the police officer swiftly grabbed him, and although the Chinese man fired two shots in a row, he eventually took his pistol. (2) Chinese Police Li Jinliang No. 1082, because the police officer saw his Western police chief trapped by a gangster holding a pistol on December 19 this year, he bravely stepped forward to rescue him and wounded the gangster. Although the gangster shot at him, he eventually helped his Western police chief to holster the gangster's pistol.

His arrival in Shanghai will be around the 5th of next month.

### A Bomb on Simaru Road; Ping Bao's Neighbor Bombed; Eight People Injured

At about 6:15 pm yesterday evening, a grenade explosion occurred in the downtown area of ​​the Public Concession, at the eastern end of Fuzhou Road and Fujian Road. At that time, the grenade flew from nowhere and hit the sign of the Wenyuange Bookstore, causing the sign to be shattered. After the incident, the police took the shrapnel back for inspection and temporarily guarded the area and searched it carefully, but found nothing. According to reports, the bombed Wenyuange is next door to the individual newspaper. What was the purpose of the grenade? The police are investigating. When the bomb exploded, fragments injured eight people: Zhou Chenshi, 20 years old, injured in the left arm; Cai Shenshi, 23 years old, injured in the nose and knee; Zhang Peiliang, 15 years old, injured in the foot; Chen Futang, 38 years old, injured in the head; Chen Liang, 22 years old, injured in the left leg; Pan Erqing, 26 years old, injured in the right leg; Zhou Chenshi, 22 years old, from Nantong, injured in the face; Cai Chenshi, 20 years old, from Nantong, injured in the right leg.

### After Wasting a Huge Amount of Money, Shanghai Ships Venture to Wenzhou; Several Small Ships Have Been Approved by the Japanese; But Larger Ships Are Unwilling to Join

Zi Lin Bao said, yesterday (29th), it was learned that several small ship owners in this city have obtained permission from the Japanese Naval authorities stationed in Shanghai to send ships to sail outside the Jiangsu sea area patrolled by Japanese warships. Although these sea areas are no more than Hangzhou Bay, some small ships have recently carried goods and passengers to Wenzhou. After passing many islands near the port, still under the control of the Chinese army, the goods and passengers were safely landed in Wenzhou.

All Ships to Wenzhou Must Pay Fees

After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War and the Japanese imposed shipping restrictions on major ports, Wenzhou became an important trading port. Ships sailing along the coast are all anchored there. Regarding ships sailing outside the Jiangsu sea area, according to well-informed sources in the shipping industry, the shipowners have temporarily agreed with the Japanese naval authorities that all ships must pay certain fees for sailing, but it has not been specified where they can sail. Recently, some owners of difficult ships have verbally agreed with the Japanese authorities that they can send ships carrying goods and passengers to anchor at the islands outside Wenzhou to wait for the evening, and then the goods and passengers will be transferred to flat-bottomed boats and safely landed in Wenzhou.

Freight Reaches 600 Yuan Per Ton

Deep-water giant ships cannot enter Wenzhou, and the Chinese have built countless fortresses on the nearby islands, and ships are especially difficult to sail in the dangerous waters between the islands, so it is obviously difficult for the Japanese to strictly blockade the area. It is heard that the freight for shipping goods to Wenzhou has reached a huge 600 yuan per ton due to the current situation. Even so, only small ship owners are willing to send ships to venture to Wenzhou, while large ship owners are cautious and keep their ships idle to avoid accidents such as being detained. According to well-informed sources, the Japanese ban on shipping has become part of the Japanese navy's policy in Chinese waters, rather than a local incident. It is heard that speculators in the shipping industry rent small ships to sail to Wenzhou, and the rent for each trip is as high as 30,000 to 40,000 yuan.

Do Not Go to the Dangerous Road of Ganpu

According to a recent report from Ganpu, the blockade along the coast of Huangdaoguan has been extremely tense recently. If sailing boats are seen at sea, they will be sunk. If refugees are encountered on the shore, they will be killed regardless. It is heard that 16 people were killed outside the seawall of Changchuanba, and more than 70 people were killed in Huangwan. On the nights of the 25th and 26th of this month, more than 80 refugees from Shaoxing on the opposite side of the river arrived at Huangdaoguan. People from Gan Town managed to rescue them and waited for a boat to send them back to the opposite side of the river. In this situation, it is obvious that the Yujiao area of ​​Shaoxing does not know the danger of crossing the river, and the boatmen only want to get the ferry fare, and put the refugees in the boat on the north bank in the dark and sail away, leaving the passengers to sacrifice by the river, which is unbearable to see. It is heard that shipwrecks and cargo sinking are common along the coast of Ganza, and travelers are still not extinct. It is hoped that the Shanghai groups of Ning Shao will quickly telegraph the competent authorities of their respective areas to prohibit the people from traveling this dangerous road and crossing the river north, so as not to endanger their lives.

Hai Fu Unloading Cargo Again Blocked

After the German merchant Lihe Yoko's Hai Fu wheel entered the port, it berthed at the Roosevelt Wharf at the 16th pier with the Feikang wheel. Unexpectedly, the Japanese prohibited the cargo carried by the Hai Fu wheel from being unloaded ashore. It is learned that the reason is that the Japanese believe that the wheel is loaded with local products exported from Wenzhou that are prohibited by the Japanese. The wheel has now been changed to the Roosevelt pontoon, and the Japanese navy has sent people to guard it. The shipping department of the Hai Fu wheel has reported the situation to the German consulate and negotiated with the Japanese. The cargo of the Fei Kang wheel has been unloaded and is now transferred to the Pujiang pontoon. The Moufu wheel is scheduled to berth at the wharf for unloading cargo next Monday. In addition, after the British merchant Kaiming Maler wheel was prevented from exporting by the Japanese, the cargo has been unloaded on the dock, and the Chinese comprador who was detained has not yet been released. In addition, the three Yi small wheels that were previously detained by the Japanese naval marine police team were monitored at the Roosevelt Wharf because they were loaded with cotton. Recently, the three small wheels were moved near the Roosevelt Wharf at the 16th pier (formerly the Xinjiangtian Wharf) and are still being monitored.

### After the Ningbo Plague Was Eradicated, Report to Shanghai on the Aftermath

### Rickshaw Franchise Plan to be Approved by the Shanghai Municipal Council: Rickshaw fares to be charged according to official prices, and the business to be registered under a foreign name.

According to the Continental Times, business community sources claimed yesterday (the 29th) that some rickshaw owners in the International Settlement recently submitted a plan to the Shanghai Municipal Council to establish a rickshaw franchise company, which is expected to be approved soon. According to the plan drafted by the initiators, the new company will be organized similarly to existing public transportation companies and will be strictly supervised by the authorities of the International Settlement. It will also charge fares according to the rates approved by the Shanghai Municipal Council. It is believed that the authorities of the International Settlement will understand the benefits of establishing this franchise company, as this measure will not cause any inconvenience or difficulties for rickshaw pullers and will greatly improve rickshaw service. It is reported that the rickshaw company being proposed will be registered under a foreign name, with exclusive operating rights. Shareholders will include major rickshaw companies in the city. 社員 Prinold will deliver a speech on his hobbies, entitled "Modern Navy," and a film will be shown for entertainment.

### Banks Achieve Considerable Profits in 1940: Additional Check Clearing Today; Silver and Money Businesses to Close Saturday Afternoons Starting Next Year.

Today marks the end of 1940. The silver and money businesses, as well as other industries, are conducting annual year-end closings. Shanghai's financial market remains stable thanks to the support of the Central Bank of China, Bank of China, and Communications Bank, as well as the regulatory efforts of the silver and money business reserve fund. Low interbank lending rates, exchange rates, and discount rates demonstrate ample credit and the absence of any financial strain. All industries have been able to pass through peacefully. 銀錢 businesses will close for three days starting tomorrow, reopening on the 4th.

Increased Clearing

To facilitate clearing for member banks and financial institutions, the Bank Clearing House will add an additional clearing session at 4:45 PM today, in addition to the regular session at 3:15 PM. The clearing time for financial institutions will also be temporarily extended today. It is reported that collections and settlements by banks and financial institutions have been busy since yesterday. Therefore, it is stipulated that employees are not allowed to take leave during this closing period. It is said that the business operations of all banks this year have achieved considerable profits. However, with increased deposits and a lack of legitimate investment channels, in addition to temporarily reducing interest rates on demand deposits, surplus capital from Shanghai will be transferred to the interior to assist the government in developing the inland areas.

Preparing for Year-End Settlement

All industries have begun preparations for the year-end settlement period on January 26th, including adjusting balances and purchasing New Year's goods. The Money Business Association is scheduled to hold an executive committee meeting at 2:00 PM on January 10th to discuss plans for handling business operations around the year-end settlement period. The Silver and Money Business Associations have notified member banks and financial institutions that January 26th, although a Sunday holiday, will remain open for business as usual to facilitate collections and settlements for all industries. However, banks will be closed for three days starting January 27th, while financial institutions will be closed for four days. It is also reported that for outstanding customer accounts, staff have been dispatched locally to distribute payment requests and urge collection, while for accounts in other cities, the Chamber of Commerce has been requested to certify and dispatch staff to collect.

Clearing Time

The Silver and Money Business Associations have approved the issue of closing on Saturday afternoons, which will be implemented starting in 1941. Considering that the first day of business next year (the 4th) is a Saturday, the Silver and Money Business Associations will convene this afternoon to discuss the receipt of bills and clearing times on Saturdays. An announcement will be made once a decision has been reached. A reporter from New Voice learned from the Silver and Money Businesses that the reason for closing on Saturday afternoons is that foreign banks on the Bund are closed on Saturday afternoons. To unify operations, it has been decided to implement this closure, which will also avoid the difficulties faced during the "May 2nd" [likely a past financial panic] crisis. Furthermore, since depositors have been notified in advance, there should be no inconvenience caused.

### Couple Kidnapped After Leaving Gambling Den Late at Night

Rickshaw driver chased away, bandits drove off in the car. Car found but the two victims are missing.

According to the North China Daily News, at 5:45 AM yesterday (the 29th) on Jing'an Temple Road, an elderly Chinese couple disappeared after stepping out of a hired car (license plate number 18177) after leaving a certain club. It is believed that they were kidnapped by bandits and their whereabouts are unknown. Initially, the two Chinese individuals left the club in a rental car. Five people suddenly jumped out from the darkness, two of whom were armed.

Ordered to Stop

They forced the rickshaw driver out of the car, and then the five of them climbed into the car and drove off at high speed along Haig Road towards the west. The car was later found on Great Western Road. Inside the car was a Chinese-style short jacket. No other clues or fingerprints were found. Jing'an Temple police received a report from the rickshaw driver and immediately began an investigation. It is generally believed that the Chinese couple won big at a certain gambling den and were targeted by bandits who waited for an opportunity to

Abduct and Escape

In the past, there have been several robbery cases in the western district. Several victims had won big in "illegal" gambling dens. As soon as they left the gambling den, they were stopped by two or three gangsters who demanded "tips." If they refused, they would be robbed. In some cases, it has been determined that the robberies were instigated by people from within the gambling den. Also, according to the Shanghai Times, the two Chinese individuals were believed to be a married couple. They rented a car from Xinglong Automobile Company at 215 Zili Nan Road, instructing the driver to drive to the intersection of North Henan Road and Baigan Road. However, as soon as the car left the club's gate, it was ambushed by five people who rushed out from the roadside.

### New World Hotel Sued for Eviction

The case was heard yesterday afternoon by Judge Dong in the Civil Third Division. The defendant, New World Hotel, appointed lawyer Wu Linkun to appear in court, requesting the plaintiff's claim be rejected. He claimed that there was a prior oral agreement for at least another year and a half of lease extension. However, Chen Tingrui, the agent lawyer of the plaintiff Feilong Real Estate Company, insisted that the defendant should vacate immediately according to the contract. After hearing the arguments, the court adjourned the case and scheduled another hearing after investigation. During the adjournment, the court hoped that both parties would conduct conciliation outside the court. The agent lawyers of both parties followed the instructions and withdrew.

His Chinese manager, Liang Rong, was also arrested at his residence on Medhurst Road and handed over to the authorities for investigation. Upon learning that Pu Bi Du was running a gambling den, the Portuguese Consulate immediately dispatched court prosecutor Tai Ke Xi Lai to conduct an investigation. Once the investigation is complete, a trial is expected to be held. However, it is reported that the Portuguese authorities have not detained Pu Bi Du, nor have they ordered him to post bail.

Xia Yonggen, a native of Changzhou, drove the car. On the 27th, while transporting the skins to Shanghai, the car was suddenly stopped and robbed of both the car and the goods by a gang of bandits at the intersection of Weihaiwei Road and Muirhead Road. Yang Wenquan and Xia Yonggen reported the incident to the Jing'an Temple police station. Huatan Sun Zhian and others investigated and found Xia Yonggen's statement to be suspicious.

Yesterday morning, all were escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court.

### Society: The Rights of Children

— Stedy

The unemployment and poverty of countless people has subjected children to terrible fates, making us unable to bear looking at the misery of those threatened by hunger and cold! Unable to bear hearing the cries of those abused by society!

I do not believe that there are parents who do not love their children, nor do I believe that there are no parents who can fulfill their parental duties, but I cannot believe that there are no parents who do not know how to be parents, and even parents who treat their children as private property like "greed clouds their minds."

Ellen Key, in her "Laws of the Future Society," writes about the rights of children:

"All children have the right to receive an education and sound parents who are able to fulfill their parental duties.

"All children have the right to protect their mental and physical well-being from all abuse, such as beatings, forced labor, hunger, and filth.

"All children, during their growth period, whether healthy or sick, have the right to receive full protection and attention; to be given the full influence of nature and culture without restriction; and to be given appropriate vocational training according to their abilities, regardless of class, in order to achieve full physical and mental development.

"All children have the right to be placed in necessary and good circumstances to fully use their fully developed abilities."

But let us look at our real society!

We cannot blame parents who sell their children or parents of scavenging children, the difficulties of life have made them commit unpardonable crimes. Ellen Key says it well:

"We condemn the past era for abandoning newborn babies and throwing the young brothers of conquered cities to their deaths on the walls, at the same time, the future era will also condemn our current level of culture. Not only that, but the condemnation of our era will be even more severe! Because when the people of the past shed the blood of children like water, they themselves did not know what they were doing; the present era, makes millions of children tired, hungry, abuses them, and despises them. In schools, they torture them, making them degenerate, and when they commit crimes, they know all the consequences that arise from this - the consequences for mankind and society."

May all parents in the world respect the rights of children!

May everyone work together to create a society in which every child has equal and reasonable rights.

### Returning from the Line of Death to the Path of Hunger and Cold

— Kang Hua

I was fine when I got home on Saturday evening, but things changed after dinner. I felt a cold sensation on my back, and my limbs felt tired. The "pillar of humanity" that I had been dragging around all day looked like it was about to collapse.

I went to bed, and the cold turned into a fever. My eyes were almost blurry, and my head was swollen and dizzy. I thought that my friends on the dance floor probably felt the same way. But I was already panting!

My breathing seemed heavier than usual. My loving mother was the only object of my fears. I kept asking for tea and water all night. In a two-person household, if I collapsed, it would burden my elderly mother, who had just climbed out of a pile of stomach illnesses. Alas, the poor seem to be born with "bitter lives." Once they are "born," they are destined to suffer, to be exploited, to be whipped, until they return to the road they came from. However, I think that although one has to go through a period of being trampled on from "birth" to returning home, since it is life, he should work hard for being human, sending away those who exploit and oppress us, and burying the world that eats people. It should also be the main topic in this short period of life. Therefore, people who are sick should not be hopeless!

But today, the pain that comes with illness will not only be physical, but also mental. (The pain of not having "money.") Seeing a doctor requires "money," and getting medicine also requires "money." Lying in bed and not working means "no" money, but the family still needs "money." So borrowing money, pawning things, selling children, selling wives, and committing suicide in the Huangpu River are all common occurrences. As for me, I have no children to sell or pawn, and no wife, and I don't have the courage to commit suicide, so I have to grit my teeth and fight to the death.

I couldn't bear it any longer, so I called a doctor. He diagnosed it as "rotten throat rash." (Western medicine calls it "diphtheria.") This was terrible. Going to the hospital required "money," and getting antitoxin required "money." Without "Yuan Shikai" [slang for money] helping, I really didn't know what to do. Fortunately, the Chinese medicine "blowing medicine" still "worked." After using it, I could swallow things. Struggling from the line of hunger and cold to the line of death, I will return from the line of death to the path of hunger and cold!

"Rest for a few more days before going to work! You are in very poor health!" That was my loving mother's worried voice.

"It's okay, Mom, a young person like me doesn't have to worry about this little problem!" I replied. But my body was obviously swaying, showing that I was not "recovered" and was weak. My limbs were also very weak, and my head was dizzy, but there was no way. If I asked for another leave, I was afraid that I would be "suspended"!

"These days, finding a job is harder than "climbing to heaven," Mom, I have to go today!" I replied slowly.

Watching my swaying body going down the stairs of the "third floor," my mother hung two tears on her wrinkled face and watched me go!

I couldn't bear it, couldn't bear to see my mother so sad and upset. I went back again, tightly grasped my mother's hand, and gently hugged my mother's chest, hoping to put her at ease and calm her down!

"Mom, don't worry, eat a good lunch, and your own stomach illness is also important. I'm leaving, I'll be back at six o'clock in the evening... I'm leaving, Mom!"

Walking into the office, I was very dizzy, but there was a lot of work piled up, so I had to pick up a pen and make a sound on the paper!

### The Self-Accusation of a "Shipper"

— Qiechi

"Originally, people always hear 'Shipper,' but to be honest, it's not much different from 'apprentices.' Above me, there's the accountant, then the runner, and the boss. If something goes wrong, anyone can scold me, can curse me!

"In this time of soaring prices, the so-called 'salary' I receive is unbelievable: eighteen dollars for wages, six dollars for allowance, six dollars for rice allowance (this was added when rice was forty dollars a dan. Alas, now six dollars can't even buy a sheng of rice!), one dollar for 'monthly fees'; no more, no less, a total of thirty-one old dollars!

"At least my own meals are provided; but, taking this meager thirty-one dollars to support my family of four, isn't that ridiculous?

"Indeed, Old Guan has plenty of money, making eighty thousand dollars last year alone. (That's still a low estimate!) But we 'bitter people' who work from morning till night can't even support our families! I watch every day, maybe even personally stacking bags of rice into the boss's warehouse; but, at home, they're crying from hunger and cold!

"It's truly infuriating: regardless of wind, frost, rain, or snow, I have to sit on the truck to weigh rice every morning. I'm not 'qualified' to sit next to the driver.

"Sometimes, when 'weighing,' if the weight is slightly off, I'm not only scolded by the accountant (accusing me of 'stealing a bit'); but also receive a 'lecture' from the runner. And me? Of course, I 'humbly agree'; if even half a 'no' escapes my lips, humph! I'll be 'asked to seek employment elsewhere' immediately! Because there are hundreds and thousands of 'candidates' waiting outside! Who cares about you?

"As for coming back a little late at night, they'll insist you were 'playing around.'

"Once, Old Guan sent me to Hongkou, and I happened to get 'locked down' at the Waibaidu Bridge for five hours before being 'released.' Who knew that the old man would coldly stride over: 'Oh! You finally came? If you were any later, I was going to call the police to look for you!' You can imagine, I had no way to defend myself!

"And—"

"Okay. Don't say anymore. Just endure it, won't you?"

"That's right, when you eat someone else's rice, you have to bow to their needs!"

### Zhangtai Willow

— Gu Mingdao

However, the matter had already spread, making it a constant laughingstock. The next day, the magistrate of Changshu County and several well-known gentlemen from the area came to see Qian Muzhai again. Muzhai happily welcomed them into his inner study for conversation. Liu Rushi suspected that this was no good, so she tiptoed to the back of the wall to eavesdrop. It turned out that they all considered themselves wise and up-to-date, believing that the Ming dynasty's fate was over, the mandate of heaven had changed, and there was no turning back. The Qing army was powerful and would certainly win the empire. Many Ming officials and generals had already surrendered to them. Magistrate Weng of Changshu County, a relative, was in Hong Chengchou's staff. Hong Chengchou ordered him to write a letter urging Changshu County to submit to the Manchu Qing as soon as possible, and to persuade Wujin County to surrender as well. Because Changshu County and Wujin County were connected by marriage and close relations, it would be easy to influence them. Changshu County repeatedly urged Shouzhai to show his attitude and surrender to the Qing court as soon as possible, so as to please the Qing court and not lose his future wealth. Several gentlemen also persuaded him, strongly stating that Shangshu (Minister) was highly regarded in Jiangnan and a leader among scholars. The Qing court had always heard of his reputation. The Prince Regent was also known for his love of talent, and had previously written to Shi Kefa, advising him to surrender. But Shi Gong was stubborn and unyielding, and ultimately martyred himself in Yangzhou, causing hundreds of thousands of lives in Yangzhou to suffer the disaster of war. If Shangshu could abandon the dark and embrace the light, serving the new master, wouldn't he be able to enjoy the same wealth and glory as Hong Chengchou? Liu Rushi's heart burned with anger when she heard these people's words behind the wall, and she wanted to rush in and denounce them. She then heard Muzhai's response, which was ambiguous, implying that he was willing to follow Hong Chengchou's example. At this point, Liu Rushi could no longer restrain herself. She was an uninhibited woman who often met with famous officials and dignitaries. The mere magistrate of Changshu County was not in her thoughts. So, she straightened her clothes, walked gracefully to the inner study, and lifted the curtain to enter. Qian Muzhai's heart skipped a beat when he saw Rushi come out, and he had to say, "Has my wife arrived?" The magistrate of Changshu County and the gentlemen also stood up together, bowing to her and calling her Lady Liu. Rushi returned the courtesy and asked them to sit down one by one, settling herself in a chair at the bottom. In front of Liu Rushi, they were no longer comfortable discussing the matter. Liu Rushi forced a smile and asked, "Magistrate has been visiting repeatedly these days. I wonder what important matters you are discussing with Shangshu?" Before the magistrate of Changshu County could answer, Muzhai rushed to say, "We are just discussing matters of the state. On the one hand, we want local peace, and on the other hand, we want to fulfill our duties as subjects." Liu Rushi said, "So, what will you do?" (26)

### Bomber Dance

— He Heyie

In London, the sky is filled with the roar of Nazi bomber formations, ground emergency alarms blare, anti-aircraft guns roar, strange anti-aircraft bombs scream, and hundred-ton bombs explode… musicians weave these sounds into their music, and an anti-aircraft gunner from the air defense force writes a song; so the Londoners repeatedly sing over and over again:

"When the alarm sounds, we are no longer afraid. We are dancing the bomber dance! We don't rush out; when the Dorniers soar into the clouds, we make sounds like: Ho… Peng!"

Furthermore, so many dancers, male and female, follow the rhythm of the music and the lyrics of the song, dancing the Bomber Parade in groups in the basement, under the dim neon lights of a blackout. Couples stand shoulder to shoulder, arms around their waists, raising their arms to imitate the appearance of a twin-engine heavy bomber (see Figure 1), with postures as graceful as those of the ballet dancer Pavlova, and swirl and fly obliquely like a waltz (Figure 2), then swoop in like a rapid ascent (Figure 3), then pretend to locate the target, clapping their knees (Figure 4), when they clap their hands together (Figure 5), that's when they drop the bombs, then they point to the ground, and put their index finger from their other hand into their ear (Figure 6), so Ho… Peng! They stop like that; but soon, they begin dancing the fresh dance again.

Now the bomber dance is popular in Nottingham, and it is about to become popular nationwide. Originally, their entertainment does not forget the elegant fun of saving the country, but is a kind of ridicule of Goering's air force, and also shows the leisurely and humorous temperament of their British Empire!

The six bomber dance posture drawings here are copied from photos in the American "Life" magazine. Although they cannot be depicted very exquisitely, they can give a glimpse of the latest dance skills from thousands of miles away. I hope that all friends who are good at dancing will also dance this bomber dance, at least you should not forget this spirit!
