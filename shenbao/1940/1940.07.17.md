### Guo Taiqi Visits British Undersecretary of State, Declares China's Solemn Stance, Report of Trautmann's Return to Chongqing to Mediate Peace is Untrue, Hull Says the US Still Pursues an Independent Far East Policy

London - Prime Minister Churchill will, in his statement to the House of Commons today, expound on Britain's Far East policy following China's protest against the closure of the Burma Road.  Reliable sources claimed last night that Guo Taiqi, the Chinese Ambassador to London, in addition to lodging a protest with Britain regarding the ban on the Burma Road, also requested Undersecretary of State Butler to reaffirm Britain's commitment to the Nine-Power Treaty.  Reliable sources believe that Ambassador Guo told Butler that while China is willing to pursue peace with Japan and welcomes an honorable resolution, it believes that the chances of achieving a good outcome are no greater than those of Anglo-German peace negotiations.  Ambassador Guo stated that China's willingness to negotiate with Japan is no different in degree from Britain's negotiations with Germany.  It is said that Ambassador Guo criticized Britain for providing materials to the aggressor.  After Ambassador Guo's meeting with Butler, a Chinese spokesman here, when meeting with reporters, indicated that China is more willing to accept mediation from the United States than from Britain, or at least from both the US and Britain jointly.  The spokesman told reporters that even if all foreign supplies to China were stopped, China could still resist for nine to twelve months.  However, he pointed out that the impact of Britain's restrictions on Burma transport would deal a serious blow to China politically and spiritually.  The spokesman further stated that there are currently 1,500 tons of medical supplies waiting to be transported from Burma to the Chinese interior, but due to the lack of gasoline, automobile transport has been halted.  It is reported that this gasoline is transported from Burma.  It has recently been learned that epidemics are occurring in five provinces in the Chinese interior, threatening the lives of four million people.  When the spokesman mentioned Britain's statement that the Burma Road is completely ineffective during the rainy season, he said that the road was fully open during last year's rainy season.  Reliable sources say that Churchill is prepared to issue a statement on Sino-Japanese negotiations in the House of Commons today.  British authorities have denied that Japan has sent Britain proposals for resolving the Sino-Japanese dispute.  According to a reliable source, "Britain will not offer any peace proposals until both sides have expressed their willingness to negotiate, and Britain has not yet received any indication that both sides are prepared to negotiate." British sources here acknowledge that the restriction of the Burma Road will increase China's dependence on the Soviet Union.  Authoritative circles claim that the United States, after receiving notification from London, did not lodge a protest with Britain.  British authorities say that Washington only paid attention to London's intentions and then sent its detailed criticisms to London, but the content was not made public.  The authorities further stated that the United States knew that most of the US military supplies to China were imported via the Burma Road, and that the United States had no other access to the unoccupied interior of China, but the United States did not object to Britain's actions.  Britain's proposal to Japan regarding the Burma Road "obtained Japan's understanding and will consider the possibility of a broader solution within three months that would create equal peace between the two countries." They solemnly pointed out that Britain's agreement with Japan included a statement that Britain reserved freedom of action after three months.  In response to the Chinese claim that Britain was attempting to force China to sit at the negotiating table with Japan, British authorities stated that "Britain believes that a peaceful resolution between China and Japan must be accepted by both China and Japan to be considered satisfactory." The Japanese Embassy in London denied that Japan had made proposals to the British government for resolving the Sino-Japanese conflict.  According to authoritative sources, the British Acting Governor-General of Singapore, Jones, did not seek the Foreign Office's approval before delivering a speech stating that Britain was currently making "sincere efforts" to promote peace between China and Japan. (United Press dispatch, 16th)

Washington - The US State Department has received notification that China has strongly protested to Britain against the three-month blockade of the Burma Road, so that Japan can use this time to seek peace with China. The United States is not formally interfering in this situation, but Britain's difficulties have aroused sympathetic concern here. It is said that Britain has closely notified the United States of its actions, and there is currently no criticism in official circles. The US government has no signs of preparing to change its own policy or make concessions to peace efforts, but there is a general tendency to sympathize with Britain's desire to avoid serious friction with Japan amid the current European crisis. Secretary of State Hull and other officials declined to comment, but it is said that the US government believes that an important condition for any peace talks is that Japan respects China's political independence and freedom. At the same time, it is widely believed that although Japan is eager to end the war, it may not cease hostilities unless it obtains a special position in China. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)

Washington - Secretary of State Hull, when speaking to reporters yesterday about the news of Britain's efforts to mediate peace between China and Japan, said that the United States is still pursuing a separate and independent Far East policy. Hull met with British Ambassador Lothian before meeting with reporters, but there was no indication that they had discussed the Far East situation. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)

Washington - Acting Governor-General of Malaya, Jones's statement two days ago that Britain intends to work to end the Sino-Japanese War, has not been criticized by official circles here. However, those familiar with the Far East situation say that it is doubtful whether Jones's statement truly represents what Britain wants to do. The British Prime Minister Churchill's remarks on Sunday that he would fight Germany to the end are in stark contrast to the suggestion that China should make peace with Japan now, after three years of resistance, when Japan is clearly weakened, and abandon its three years of sacrifice. Does Jones's statement that Britain has to make all kinds of sacrifices to win victory over Germany mean that Japan threatens to trouble Britain in the Far East, so China should be one of the sacrifices? As for the so-called large-scale solution that will not harm China's interests, can Britain guarantee that Japanese troops will definitely withdraw from China? The answer is clearly no. It would be better for Britain to help friendly countries continue to resist aggression, rather than resume its policy of appeasement towards aggressors. Many Americans say that what Britain did in Munich will now be seen again in the Far East. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)

Special dispatch from this city - Adenburg, Chargé d'affaires of the German Embassy in China, told a representative of the Haitong News Agency today that rumors that the German Ambassador to China, Trautmann, had arrived in Chongqing to negotiate peace with the Chinese government were completely unfounded. He also said that not only had Ambassador Trautmann not arrived in Chongqing, but no German diplomats had arrived in Chongqing recently. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 16th)

Chongqing - Both China and Germany today acknowledged that the rumor that German Ambassador to China Trautmann was about to go to Chongqing was false. Currently, the German Embassy in Chongqing is only headed by a secretary. The German Embassy's Chargé d'affaires took leave and left Chongqing two months ago. However, well-informed sources claimed that recent changes in the European situation and the blockade of China's southern foreign transport lines may prompt an improvement in Sino-German relations. German sources predict that Germany will soon send a diplomatic representative to Chongqing. (United Press dispatch, 16th)

London - According to sources here yesterday, China has verbally protested to the British government regarding Britain's agreement to cut off the Burma Road. Well-informed sources claimed that the United States had not protested Britain's move. It is said that Washington is only paying attention to Britain's intentions. The Japanese Embassy denied that Japan had made proposals to Britain for resolving the Sino-Japanese dispute. Guo Taiqi, the Chinese Ambassador to London, visited British Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs Butler yesterday. It is said that Ambassador Guo, in verbally lodging a serious protest, stated that China considered Britain's restrictions on Burma Road transport to be "the most unfriendly act." Ambassador Guo also told Butler that China considered the British proposal to ban Burma Road transport for three months to be "an additional layer of insult in addition to emotional harm." It is said that he has protested against Britain's proposal to use the Anglo-Japanese Burma Road issue agreement to urge Sino-Japanese peace. Ambassador Guo also requested that the British government condemn the Singaporean government administrator Jones for his broadcast speech regarding Britain's efforts to create Sino-Japanese

Editorial

### Sino-British Relations and Chinese Diplomacy

Chinese people mostly harbor infinite concern and sympathy for the perilous circumstances Britain currently finds itself in; in addition to standing on humanitarian grounds, it is also because of the friendly relationship between China and Britain in recent years. Unexpectedly, at this time, various rumors have cast heavy shadows on Sino-British relations!

Among the rumors, what can be verified is probably that Britain is about to accede to Japan's request to temporarily block traffic between Burma and China for three months; however, as of now, it is only known that Britain has this intention, and a compromise has not yet been established. Moreover, China is actively negotiating with Britain, and there may still be hope for reversal. For this reason, people of great understanding in China and Britain are encountering a painful and difficult test during this short period, but it is not yet disappointment or despair.

Given the current situation, we cannot help but recall the period before and after the signing of the Anglo-Japanese "Tokyo Agreement" last year. The situation in London at that time was witnessed firsthand by reporters; under the direction of the Chamberlain cabinet, the agreement was unexpectedly concluded; British discussions were mixed, and rumors abounded, with most far-sighted people unanimously criticizing the Chamberlain cabinet for selling out Chinese interests; at the same time, they were even more worried that China would despair of British friendship as a result; they were sincerely afraid that China would not only arouse anti-British sentiment, but also open up new avenues internationally. What they were most eagerly awaiting at that time was the Chinese government's formal response. At such a juncture, the Chinese government, in a bright and frank manner, expressed it to the British people in one fell swoop; the general idea was: China absolutely does not believe that Britain will sell out China; even if there are rumors, they should be regarded as the malicious slander of other parties; to put it thoroughly, China does not believe that Britain can actually achieve the act of selling out China. This statement gave the British public opinion a great encouragement, making them feel both panic and inner shame, and then work hard to curb the Chamberlain cabinet's further insistence on its own way. This is an extremely memorable episode. Now, because of the Burma Road transportation issue, the Chinese authorities have repeatedly expressed and formally lodged serious protests with Britain. At least it has been made clear to the British people: First, China is determined to continue the war of resistance in order to achieve independent survival, and the blockade of Burma Road traffic will never affect China's fundamental position; if necessary, China can open up new avenues. Second, China does not recognize Britain's easy explanation, that is, it does not recognize that the blockade of Burma traffic is a partial and temporary measure and should be regarded as unrelated to Britain's Far East policy; therefore, it goes a step further to demand that Britain immediately clarify its basic position in the Far East. Third, because of the international nature of the Burma transportation line, China has the right to request that it continue to maintain transportation. China's attitude is completely clear. As for whether the British people can turn the tide like last year, it remains to be seen their own efforts to decide.

The countries with a deep and linked relationship with Sino-British relations are, of course, the United States first, and the Soviet Union second. Historically, the various actions of the United States and Britain in the Far East have been consistently, fundamentally parallel but sometimes contradictory; after the signing of the "Tokyo Agreement" last year, US President Roosevelt suddenly announced the abolition of the US-Japan commercial treaty; afterwards, those who defended the British government's policy said that it was the result of Britain's skillful use of tactics, and denied that the British government intended to sell out Chinese interests. This time, the United States' attitude is surprisingly silent in the Anglo-Japanese negotiations, and I am afraid that it will form an excuse for Britain to defend its weak policy for itself. But there are many reasons to expect the United States to make a stunning statement and clear the haze.

In the unlikely event that the possible reactions of the British and American sides are not as mentioned above, then China will certainly not sit still and wait for death, and will inevitably be forced to seek another way out internationally. There are four basic reasons for this: what China seeks is only the independence, freedom and equality of the nation in the international community; in short, it only seeks survival; all those who are beneficial to the great goal of survival are willing to actively promote; this is one. China only regards those who are currently invading China as its only current enemy; in addition, there is no closeness or distance, and there is no one who is not close, no love or hatred, and there is no one who is not loved; therefore, it has the greatest room for maneuver in choosing allies; this is two. The important factors that determine the safety and security of the Far East, apart from China and Japan, are the United States, Britain and the Soviet Union; as far as the current situation is concerned, the proportion of these three countries in the Far East depends not on their innate relationship, but on the comparison of the active and passive attitudes of the three countries; whoever is passive reduces its proportion, whoever is active increases its proportion; only in this way can China of course change its assessment of the three countries at any time; this is three. The outcome of the European war cannot be reversed; China will never underestimate itself excessively in the European war, whether during or after the war, and will never always consider itself insignificant; moreover, if Britain is determined to withdraw from the Far East, then there may be other subtle changes between China and Japan; this is four. From these four points, it can be seen that if Britain changes its basic policy towards the Far East, China will still have room for actively exercising independent diplomacy in the international arena.peace broadcast speech, authoritative circles claimed that the Singapore government official Jones's speech on Sunday evening, stating that Britain was "making its most sincere efforts" to promote peace between China and Japan, had not been discussed with the Foreign Office beforehand. (United Press dispatch, 16th)

London - It is announced here that under the terms of the Anglo-Japanese negotiations on the Burma Road, Britain has agreed to close the road for three months, with the condition that Japan try to use this period to negotiate an honorable peace with China. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)

London - The BBC's announcement that Britain has agreed to block the Burma Road to China for three months, with the condition that Japan use this three months to negotiate an honorable peace with China, is said to be too simple and easily misleading. In fact, Britain hopes to use the next three months to resolve some Far Eastern issues, including the general relationship between Britain and Japan. The Burma Road issue is particularly important. The Times today published an editorial criticizing the Singapore Acting Governor-General Jones's broadcast speech on Sunday regarding the possibility of Sino-Japanese peace talks, stating that the British government has repeatedly stated that it is willing to assist in the solution of the Far East problem, provided that its obligations can be accepted by both China and Japan, and that any solution should be based on fair principles. At the same time, it has notified the US government of its offer to Japan. Although Britain is not the only non-Asian country with important interests in the Far East, our current work in the West has prompted Japan to exert almost all of its diplomatic pressure on us. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)

Tokyo - The news from London and Washington that Britain has agreed to block the Burma Road for three months, with the condition that Japan negotiate an honorable peace with China, cannot be verified here. Responsible sources told Reuters that it was too early to say that Britain and Japan had reached a compromise. According to the Asahi Shimbun, British Ambassador Craigie asked Foreign Minister Arita Hachiro yesterday to announce the specific contents of the basic understanding between the two countries in a few days, because the British Ambassador had to report the results of yesterday's negotiations to London. The announcement will be made on Thursday or Friday. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)

Chongqing - The Acting Governor-General of the British Malay Archipelago, Jones's broadcast speech in Singapore Harbor yesterday, was recently commented on by responsible sources here. Regarding the issue of peace talks, China's position and conditions have been stated repeatedly and have not changed. If Japan does not accept these conditions, then any foreign attempts at mediation will be ineffective. The British Embassy also stated that the content of Jones's speech was only read in the newspapers. In short, official circles in both China believe that the British government will not formally come forward to mediate the peace, and that Jones's speech is only enough to represent his personal views. (Havas dispatch, 15th)

Washington - News today that the United States is adopting a "wait-and-see" policy in its efforts for peace in the Far East. Secretary of State Hull told reporters yesterday that the United States is adopting an independent policy on Britain's negotiations on peace between China and Japan in the East. (International News Service dispatch, 16th)

Tokyo - A spokesman for the Japanese Foreign Ministry stated to a reporter from the Haitong News Agency stationed in Tokyo today that he did not know what the rumor that Britain was mediating the Sino-Japanese War was based on. The Japanese side did not know that such an incident had occurred, and Japan had no intention of asking Britain to mediate. Japan's policy has not changed. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 16th)

### British Commentator Advocates Concessions

London - Renowned commentator Bartlett, commenting on the current talks between British Ambassador Craigie and Japanese Foreign Minister Arita, advocated that Britain make concessions to Japan, presenting the following arguments: (1) Britain is currently engaged in the war in the North Sea and the Mediterranean Sea. It would be very dangerous to participate in the war in the Pacific. It would not be in China's interest for Britain to fail due to excessive obligations. (2) The blockade of the Burma Road is limited to three months, so that it can be observed during this period whether a general solution can be negotiated. (3) Germany is eager to see Britain get involved in the Far East dispute, which is an important reason why we must avoid this. (4) Any solution cannot be completed without China's consent. Japan is still using the European war to pursue its own interests. This is the common opinion of the general public. However, opinions vary as to whether Japan's demands will become more intense and insistent if they are answered with concessions. Official circles believe that a policy of concession is what the wise should do. Those outside official circles still remember the policies used against Germany and Italy in the past, so they doubt whether it is beneficial to deal with Japan with this policy. The general public believes that the blockade of the Burma Road will not immediately affect China, but the Chinese do not agree with this view. Non-official American comments are indeed critical, but American materials that are very useful for combat are still being shipped to Japan. Britain today still supports any specific policy advocated by the US State Department, and the US official circles seem to be quite understanding of Britain's arguments. Bartlett deeply believes that Britain has not clearly informed the Soviet Union of the difficulties encountered in the Far East discussions, and claims that many of the goods passing through the Burma Road come from the Soviet Union. Bartlett concluded by saying that since Cripps's mission to Moscow and Churchill's recent meeting with the Soviet Ambassador to Britain, Maisky, Anglo-Soviet relations have improved, and Berlin is clearly very worried about this. However, those who preside over British foreign policy clearly have not yet thought about taking this kind of courteous action, which will at least be considered welcome, or even a step that will become an important political gesture. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)

Chongqing Newspaper Comments - A Glimpse

Chongqing - Regarding the issue of Burma transport, Britain has expressed concessions to Japan, agreeing to stop the import of certain goods into China within a certain period. After the Chinese side received this news, in addition to the government lodging the most serious protest with the British government and waiting for its reply, many newspapers here also wrote comments. The "Central Daily News" on the 15th was entitled "Respectfully Inform the British Government and People," and its conclusion stated, "If Japan is going to wage war against Britain, then Britain's tolerance of the Burma issue will not be enough to stop it. If Japan does not intend to wage war, then Britain's refusal of Japan's unreasonable demands will definitely not dare to wage war, in order to remind Britain, hoping that it knows how to deal with itself." Other newspapers also expressed regret over Britain's actions. The National Gazette stated, "Although Britain has not been defeated in Europe, it has already placed itself in the position of a defeated country in the Far East." (Dispatch, 16th)

Chongqing - This morning, all Chinese newspapers here wrote articles criticizing Britain's policy of compromise. It is currently too early to obtain Chinese criticism of the news of Britain's efforts for Sino-Japanese peace. In fact, there are various reasons to believe that such news will not be published by the Chinese newspapers. The newspapers did not publish Acting Governor-General of Malaya Jones's broadcast on Sunday. There is more reason to believe that the Japanese army will immediately step up its military operations in order to obtain a quick decision in China. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)

### Chongqing Chinese Air Force Shoots Down Three Japanese Planes, Japanese Drop Bombs on Market in Western Suburbs, Causing Fires, Chinese Air Force Fighter Ding Jun Sacrifices His Life

Chongqing - Fifty-four Japanese planes attacked the Chinese capital on the 16th in two batches, which was the 31st Japanese air raid on Chongqing this year. The Chinese Air Force, having conserved its strength for a long time, was even braver, so when the Japanese planes attacked today, after the Chinese Air Force made a slight pounce head-on, three Japanese planes were shot down. The remaining Japanese planes were injured and fled eastward. The other planes all returned safely except for flying general Ding Shoukang, who was unfortunately seriously injured in air combat. After parachuting, he died due to excessive bleeding before he could be rescued. Ding was brave and generous, and had shot down five Japanese planes. Now he has unfortunately died. The Air Force comrades are all filled with grief and indignation, vowing to avenge the martyr. (Dispatch, 16th)

Chongqing - After temporarily ceasing air raids on July 9, Japanese planes again bombed Chongqing fiercely in three batches this afternoon. Japanese planes first appeared in the city's sky at 11:15 am, dropping bombs in the western suburbs. The main streets in the area were hit and caught fire. Two hours later, Japanese planes appeared over Chongqing again, bombing the upper city fiercely, and then flew from there to the confluence of the Yangtze and Jialing Rivers, dropping bombs along the way, causing several bombs to fall on the city park in the lower city. It is not yet possible to confirm the rumors that several bombs hit the so-called safe zone near the US Embassy on the south bank of the Yangtze River. Those who came here from the south bank this afternoon all said that they did not see any bombs falling on the south bank. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)

### Rumor that Britain Will Stop Burma Road Transport, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Expresses His Opinion, If Britain Treats the Burma Road Issue and Sino-Japanese Peace as One, It Is No Different from Britain Helping Japan to Force China to Submit to Japan, China's Just War of Resistance Cannot Be Stopped by Any Oppression

Chongqing - According to foreign news agencies, the British government will accede to Japan's request to stop Burma's transport to China, and use this as a period for Sino-Japanese peace, etc. A reporter from the Central News Agency specifically visited Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to ask for his opinion on this matter. He replied as follows: I believe that Britain will not take this action that violates public law and loses national credibility. If the Burma Road transport issue is treated as one with Sino-Japanese peace, it is no different from Britain helping Japan to force China to submit to Japan, then the result will definitely sacrifice China's friendship, and it will definitely sacrifice Britain's position in the Far East. It must be known that China has been standing firm for three years of the War of Resistance and will not be shaken by any coercion from a third country. If Britain really takes this action, I can assert that Britain will definitely get extremely opposite results, and it itself will suffer infinite and unpredictable disasters. If Britain believes that stopping our Burma Road transport can shorten the Far East war, I again assert that the result will definitely further fuel the war in the Far East and expand the war in the Far East. As for the purpose of our China's War of Resistance against Japan, it is to seek the integrity of territorial administrative sovereignty. If this goal cannot be achieved for one day, then the War of Resistance will not stop for one day. The Chinese nation's War of Resistance today cannot be stopped by any oppression. This is not only well known to Britain and the governments of friendly countries, but also to the people of the whole world, who all recognize the profoundness of the Chinese national spirit and revolutionary strength, which cannot be deceived. (Dispatch, 16th)

### Important Statement by Foreign Spokesperson

Chongqing: The Foreign Ministry spokesperson issued the following statement on the 16th regarding the Yunnan-Burma transportation issue: Although the Chinese government has repeatedly stated its position to the British side, the British government, yielding to pressure from Japan, has surprisingly expressed submission and accepted unreasonable demands, agreeing to suspend the transport of certain goods into China via the Burma Road for a specified period. The Chinese government cannot but express its gravest concern regarding the decision made by the British government and considers this action not only extremely unfriendly but also unlawful. The continued maintenance of Burma transportation is of utmost importance to China's resistance against aggression, which goes without saying. The British acceptance of Japan's demands has given the aggressor a significant advantage. Therefore, the British action is tantamount to assisting China's enemy. The British government has repeatedly declared that its policy towards China will never change. However, the steps now being taken can in no way be considered consistent with its stated policy. The Burma route is not only an important route for China's foreign communication but also a commercial artery closely related to the interests of several countries. Therefore, the free use of the Burma route should not be regarded as a matter involving only China and Burma but should actually be viewed as an international issue of particular concern to countries with substantial commercial interests in the Far East. From a legal standpoint, the British government's position also lacks any basis. Japan is engaged in aggression against China without declaring war and therefore cannot enjoy the rights of a belligerent state recognized by international law. Even third countries are not required to assume the obligations of neutral states. Even if Japan had acquired the status of a fully belligerent state, its rights would still be limited to temporarily searching neutral ships on the high seas or within enemy territorial waters, seizing contraband, effectively blockading enemy ports, and other actions permitted by recognized wartime regulations.

### Rise of One-Party Movement in Japan - Yonei Cabinet Resigns En Masse - Fumimaro Konoe to Take Office Again - Seiyukai Officially Announces Dissolution

Tokyo: The Yonei Cabinet, which was established only six months ago, resigned en masse this afternoon. Prior to this, Army Minister Shunroku Hata, after the Army's three-chiefs conference, met with the Prime Minister for the second time, conveying the Army's view that the urgent task for Japan at present is to establish a new national political structure. Because the cabinet lacked cooperation in organizing a new political structure, he submitted his resignation. Prime Minister Yonei first asked the Army Minister to recommend a successor, but the Army Minister replied that the Army's three leaders had decided to refuse to recommend a successor. The Prime Minister then decided to resign. (16th Reuters dispatch)

Hong Kong: Tokyo report: Chief Cabinet Secretary Ishiwata made a statement at 5:30 this afternoon, saying that since the formation of the current cabinet, the entire cabinet has unanimously strived to handle important domestic and foreign affairs. Now, because the Army Minister, in view of the current political situation, has submitted his resignation, Prime Minister Yonei has decided to resign. (16th special dispatch)

Tokyo: The Yonei Cabinet resigned en masse today. This was decided at a special cabinet meeting. Prior to this, Army Minister Shunroku Hata resigned to Prime Minister Yonei and refused to recommend a successor. Yonei was then forced to resign. At 4:30 p.m., Yonei reported his decision to the cabinet. It is believed that Shunroku Hata, in light of the current domestic and foreign situation, has agreed with Konoe and others' advocacy of one-party rule and insisted that the cabinet must adopt a new structure. It is also heard that Shunroku Hata said that building a one-party regime can help Japan implement rearmament, strengthen economic controls, strengthen diplomatic policies, promote the end of the Sino-Japanese War, and seek the construction of a "New Order in East Asia." Japanese political circles believe that the Emperor may entrust the task of organizing a new cabinet to former Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe. If Konoe forms a cabinet, he will surely form a completely new political structure, because Japan's single-party movement has already elected Konoe as the leader of this movement.

Tokyo: Minister of Commerce and Industry Ginjiro Fujiwara recently stated to reporters that he believes that Japan's foreign trade should not be increased by two or three times. The current total annual trade volume is 5 billion yen, which can be greatly increased to 10 billion yen or 15 billion yen in the future. Although Japan's foreign trade has suffered a major blow due to the current European war, the future is not bleak. Currently, Japan is the only country in the world that can supply goods to Central and South America, Southeast Asia, India, and Africa. For this reason, the government is currently drafting a plan to unify and control the foreign trade mechanism. (15th Havas dispatch)

### Philippine President Requests Emergency Powers

### Democratic Party Designates Roosevelt as Candidate - Bankhead Praises Roosevelt's Achievements - Nine Out of Ten Party Members Favor Aiding Britain

Chicago: When the Democratic Convention opened here yesterday, Chicago Mayor Kelly stated, "We pray that the person who can keep the White House as a beacon of humanity will accept the presidential nomination again. We must elect Roosevelt." After he finished speaking, the audience cheered. When Postmaster General and Chairman of the Democratic National Committee Farley asked the audience to be quiet, someone from the side shouted, "We need Roosevelt!" The convention opened with a prayer. The pastor blessed, "May our free country forever be a torch to guide the world." Then a singer sang "The Star-Spangled Banner." After Kelly's speech, Senator Lucas spoke on behalf of the Governor of Illinois, saying that he believed that "the convention will not only satisfy the hopes of the people of Illinois and the entire United States but also encourage freedom-loving people all over the world, making them know that American democracy is still the highest authority." Before the opening, Farley told reporters that he believed that everything should be done in accordance with normal procedures, that is, after the states vote by roll call, the selected person should be unanimously chosen. He did not know what Roosevelt's attitude would be if the number of votes for other presidential candidates increased. Reporters then concluded from Farley's words that President Roosevelt was prepared to accept a third term if the Democratic Party unanimously agreed. The meeting adjourned after 46 minutes and resumed at 10 a.m. today. (16th Reuters dispatch)

Chicago: Speaker of the House Bankhead, in a speech at the opening of the Democratic Convention last night, advocated giving Britain all possible material assistance within the scope of American law, except for war. He also said that the Democratic Party should declare that it does not want to appease aggressor nations that attack the principles of freedom. Bankhead denied the claim that the Democratic Party was leading the country into war, saying that Roosevelt and Hull both wanted to do their best to maintain peace in Europe within the bounds of reason and prevent the United States from being drawn into war. Bankhead also stated the Democratic Party's domestic achievements, saying that the Republican Convention did not propose to abolish the domestic New Deal measures. He also said that President Roosevelt had already called on the nation to understand the reality before Norway, Belgium, Denmark, and the Netherlands were invaded, that the United States Navy has an unprecedented program, that the Army has a large-scale expansion, and that the plan to produce 50,000 aircraft per year is all the achievement of the Democratic Party and is different from the record of the regressive Republican Party. Some people may accuse President Roosevelt of interfering in European affairs, but in fact, Roosevelt only represents humanity, asking to maintain peace and avoid the spread of war. Roosevelt has never advocated joining the European war, and even the Democratic staff in Congress unanimously oppose sending troops to the battlefields in Europe or Asia. (16th Reuters dispatch)

Chicago: Observers here said today that the primary election on Thursday will nominate Roosevelt as a candidate for a third term as President of the United States, creating a new record in election history. The first day of the Democratic National Convention began yesterday afternoon, when registration of 3,000 delegates and other opening procedures were handled. Mayor Kelly delivered a welcoming speech on behalf of all the citizens of Chicago. Representative Bankhead of Alabama delivered the opening address last night, asking all Americans to cooperate with the Democratic Party again in this critical moment. Senator Burns, who had previously sought to be a candidate for Vice President, has now withdrawn and is serving as Roosevelt's campaign aide. Roosevelt's political confidant, Secretary of Commerce Hopkins, is serving as Roosevelt's intelligence officer because Roosevelt does not want to attend the meeting. However, it is rumored that Roosevelt may come to the meeting at the end of this week. As for Farley, who withdrew from the election and resigned from the position of Postmaster General, it is heard that he has also refused to serve as Chairman of the National Democratic Party again. The campaign platform will be submitted for discussion today, and it is heard that its main points are non-participation in the European war and expansion of national defense. New York Senator Wagner, who is in charge of drafting, will probably still preside over the debate. Vice President Garner is still a candidate for the vice presidential nomination and his name will be proposed by the Texas delegation on Thursday. (16th International News dispatch)

New York: The New York Times states that, according to an investigation in Chicago, more than 90% of the Democrats who first arrived in Chicago to attend the Democratic Convention favor aiding Britain to some extent.

The Allied Aid Committee, which is responsible for this investigation, said that when the Republican Convention was recently held in the city, a similar investigation was also conducted, and the results showed that only 45% favored providing aid to the Allies.

### Italian Air and Naval Activity in the Eastern Mediterranean; British Ship Sunk by Italian Submarine; Fierce Fighting in East Africa, British Forces Withdraw from Moyale

London: Yesterday, the Axis powers began attacking the "Holy Land." Simultaneously, intense battles took place in the skies above industrial areas of both countries between British and German bombers and fighters. Casualties in Palestine were relatively few. Nazareth, the birthplace of Christianity, was bombed by Italian warplanes. News from Rome continues to state that the Italian Air Force is very active in the Eastern Mediterranean, having sunk two divisions of the British Navy. (International Telegram, 16th)

Rome: The Italian High Command issued a war bulletin today stating that one of our submarines attacked six enemy destroyers yesterday, sinking one. Our air force bombed the British naval base in Haifa, Palestine, with oil depots catching fire. The flames were visible from 150 kilometers away. All our aircraft returned safely to base. Enemy aircraft attempted to bomb Tobruk but failed, with one being shot down and the pilots captured. In East Africa, our forces have occupied Dakaba and its neighboring areas. The enemy attempted to invade our Rudolf Lake positions but were heavily defeated and repelled. (Haitong Telegram, 16th)

London: On the northern border of Kenya, British forces, along with the Royal and South African Air Forces, have launched small-scale offensives. British troops have crossed the border several times. The Italian colonial troops in this area have fought slightly better than those in Sudan. However, only at the beginning of this month did they make a serious attempt to occupy British border outposts in Moyale. This Italian action was thwarted by timely British reinforcements. However, the Italian attempt to occupy these outposts continues. The British defenders are currently holding their ground. News from Cairo today reports that fierce fighting has broken out. It is reported that the British forces participating in this battle are the renowned King's African Rifles, and, as expected, they have performed exceptionally well. (Reuters Telegram, 16th)

Furthermore, nine Italian aircraft were shot down by our forces on the 9th of this month, and another fifteen were shot down by anti-aircraft guns from our warships. (Havas Telegram, 16th)

Italian Ambition Revealed Towards the Holy Land: Plotting to Control the Gateway to the Mediterranean

Rome: Italian newspapers today revealed for the first time Italy's ambitions regarding Palestine. The Italian side seems intent on eliminating British influence in Palestine and establishing Italian authority to protect Palestine. The "Italian Forum Newspaper" was particularly explicit, stating that in the past twenty years, British control of Palestine has caused bloodshed and sacrifice among the local people. Henceforth, it will not be enough to thoroughly overthrow British authority and eliminate attempts to revive Jewish power. It also stated that Britain's superior position in the Mediterranean no longer exists. From now on, the right to protect the Holy Land belongs to Italy, as Italy holds hegemony over the Mediterranean. (Haitong Telegram, 16th)

Disturbing British Sudan Military Morale: Italian Conspiracy Clearly Failed

London: Since the start of the war, Italy has been very active along the thousand-mile border between Sudan, Abyssinia, and Eritrea. According to sources here, two things are now quite clear: (1) Italian native troops are unenthusiastic about fighting; (2) Italian efforts to disrupt the British Sudan military have completely failed. Italian propaganda methods involve dropping leaflets from airplanes, but because few Sudanese soldiers are literate, the results are ineffective. The defensive forces stationed along this border, almost entirely composed of Sudanese troops, have proven themselves to be good soldiers in modern warfare during repeated clashes. They have firmly held several outposts along the border and repeatedly attacked enemy forces, inflicting heavy casualties. It is reported that some Abyssinian troops joining the British side have also assisted in the fighting. In the early stages of the war, Italian activity was limited to air raids on Sudanese ports and various locations on the Red Sea. However, since the beginning of this month, they have begun attacking British outposts at Kassala, Gallabat, and Kurmuk. The Italians, employing forces with an absolute advantage over the British, only managed to occupy these outposts after suffering extremely heavy casualties. These outposts themselves are not of military importance to the British, so there is no special reason to defend them strongly. As for why the Italians are willing to make such great sacrifices to seize them, it is likely that they can be used as a starting point for further actions against Sudan after the rainy season ends. During the current rainy season, large-scale military operations are unsuitable for the area because the muddy roads make it extremely difficult to transport large armies. (Reuters Telegram, 16th)

British Announce Details of Naval Battle

London: A naval communiqué states that more detailed information has been received regarding the recent engagement between British and Italian fleets in the Mediterranean. According to news received on the morning of July 9th, the Italian fleet included two battleships, several cruisers (some equipped with eight-inch guns), and twenty-five destroyers. Just after noon, a squadron of British light cruisers made contact with enemy cruisers. When the British battleships providing support moved within extreme range, the enemy ships immediately retreated, leading to a chase. During the exchange of fire, one enemy battleship was hit by a fifteen-inch shell and escaped under the cover of a smokescreen laid by Italian destroyers. The British light cruisers did not get close enough to destroy the enemy ships. The Italian destroyers quickly escaped through the smokescreen. Aircraft from the Fleet Air Arm then pursued and, despite intense anti-aircraft fire, managed to hit an enemy cruiser with a torpedo. The British fleet pursued the enemy ships until land was in sight. Despite continuous bombing by large numbers of Italian aircraft, the enemy ships did not attempt to re-engage. Knowing that the enemy ships had no intention of fighting again, the British squadron continued its escort duties and has now safely arrived at its destination. During the later stages of the operation, three men were killed by bomb shrapnel during an enemy air attack, but there were no other casualties, and no British ships were hit by enemy bombs or shells. Five enemy aircraft were shot down by Fleet Air Arm fighters. Also, according to an announcement on July 10th, another British fleet, including the "Hood" and "Ark Royal," was engaged in sweeping operations in the western Mediterranean and did not encounter any enemy surface vessels but were subjected to enemy bombing. Four enemy aircraft were destroyed and seven damaged, while British ships sustained no damage and suffered no casualties. (Reuters Telegram, 16th)

Rome: A diplomatic correspondent from the Stefani News Agency today summarized the opinions of Italian military experts on the military situation in the Mediterranean: (1) British naval fleets in the eastern and western Mediterranean have simultaneously attacked the Italian coast but have been forced to retreat to Gibraltar and Alexandria, thereby destroying the traditional concept of British naval supremacy and proving that Italy has the power to block the center of the Mediterranean. (2) Britain must divide its navy into two fleets to defend Gibraltar and its Near East bases, but the Italian navy can concentrate its forces. (3) Italy's large air force based in Sicily and Sardinia prevents Britain from using Malta as a base. The island has, in fact, begun to be evacuated. (4) The British Eastern Fleet returning to Alexandria is constantly bombed by the Italian Air Force. (5) The British Western Fleet has also suffered significant damage, as evidenced by the severe damage to the "Hood." (6) Because of the widespread distribution of Italian Air Force bases, British fleets cannot approach the center of the Mediterranean under any circumstances. (Haitong Telegram, 16th)

Gibraltar Bombed Four Times

New York: According to news received here today, Gibraltar was bombed four times yesterday. The British battlecruiser "Hood" and the aircraft carrier "Ark Royal," anchored in Gibraltar, were hit and caught fire, and many people were injured by shrapnel. (Haitong Telegram, 16th)

Madrid: According to eyewitnesses, several unidentified bombers circled over Gibraltar at least five times on the 13th, dropping bombs on the batteries and in the harbor. Anti-aircraft guns on land and on British ships in the harbor opened fire, but no aircraft were reported shot down. The situation in Gibraltar was tense throughout Sunday. (Haitong Telegram, 16th)

### Miss Wang Er's Troubles?

"Damn it, that Atang is really bad! Buying this kind of ringworm lotion is just a waste of money again." Miss Wang Er said indignantly.

"What? What?" Atang heard and quickly responded.

"Hmph! Are you still pretending to be stupid? How could you buy this kind of ringworm lotion that hurts like hell?" Miss Wang Er said, pointing to a certain brand of ringworm lotion.

Atang smiled and said, "So that's it! How can you blame me? It's your own fault for being greedy and only giving me twenty cents, so I could only buy a bottle randomly... but if it's effective, it's the same."

"Effective? Not only is it not getting better, but it's getting worse than before, Atang! Do you know what the most effective ringworm medicine on the market is? I don't limit your price, tell me quickly." Miss Wang Er said angrily. Atang said solemnly, "That can only be Ganlu! My whole neck was covered in ringworm, and Sister Ahua next door had impetigo, and both were cured by Ganlu. Ganlu is really—an old brand with a good reputation."

Miss Wang Er turned anger into joy and said, "Why didn't you say so earlier? Does Ganlu hurt?"

"It doesn't hurt at all, and it's cool and refreshing. No matter how itchy you are, as long as you apply Ganlu, it will stop itching immediately."

Miss Wang Er's troubles of several months were completely resolved by Atang because there was already Ganlu displayed on Miss Wang Er's dressing table. Atang smiled and said, "Miss Er! How come your fair legs are even whiter and smoother than before? Has Ganlu already cured your ringworm?" Miss Wang Er just smiled.

"Ganlu" Produced by Shanghai Tongren Western Drugstore, available in pharmacies.

### The Past and Present of Sino-Burmese International Transportation

Burma, extending 1,500 miles from Victoria Point on the Malay Peninsula to the snow-capped highlands of the upper Irrawaddy River, has become an important strategic point for Britain in the East today. What makes its position even more important is its role as an outpost for the defense of Singapore. On the other hand, Burma also occupies an important position because the five major railway lines in East and South Asia have not yet been quickly connected. Although the Indian subcontinent has 4,500 miles of railway lines, only the line to Duzdap on the Persian border connects to India, with no other railway lines connecting to areas outside India.

Burma's situation is similar, lacking railway connections with foreign lands. Burma has approximately 2,000 miles of railway lines. From Ye City on the Tenasserim coast, a railway connects to Myitkyina in the north. This line crosses the temperate zone of Burma and is 250 miles long, less than 100 miles from the Chinese border. However, there are no railways in Burma connecting to Siam (Thailand), India, or China. Within Siam, the Siamese state railway is one of the most perfectly managed railways in Asia. This line runs south from the northern forest zone of Raheng to the capital, Bangkok, and east to Ubon Ratchathani, about 100 miles from French Vietnam. Except for the expansion south towards the British Malay Federation and Singapore, the Siamese railway does not connect with other foreign areas. In Vietnam, the railway line runs from Saigon to within 100 miles of Siam, then north to Hanoi, connecting with the north only within the last five years. The Haiphong-to-Yunnan line is Vietnam's only railway to a foreign border, with a shorter branch line to the Guangxi border. At the same time, China's central railway trunk lines have no connections with India, Burma, Siam, or Vietnam.

Before 1920, there had been proposals for a great railway trunk line from Calais, France, to Shanghai for five thousand years. Some believe that the two populous countries of India and China must one day be connected by rail. However, according to the famous British sinologist Henry Yule, throughout history, no Indian conqueror has ever extended their power into Chinese territory, and few have extended power from China into India. Even the land transportation and commercial exchanges between China and India do not occupy a significant position. In recent years, the construction of railways in all of South Asia has reached a complete standstill. The railways in India and Burma are facing the threat of automobile competition, just as severely as the competition from new railway lines in Europe and the United States. No significant new railway construction has taken place in India, Burma, Siam, or southern China for more than ten years. Burma has conducted large-scale surveys for new railway lines in the past, but since the use of Turkish prisoners of war in the southern Shan States during the Great War, there has been no large-scale railway construction in Upper Burma. Therefore, transportation in various parts of South Asia still relies on sea routes. It was not until the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War that this silence was broken, and there was an attempt to construct a new transportation line through the spurs of the Himalayan mountain range.

The most famous plan to build a railway from Burma to China was proposed by Mr. Colquhoun, Deputy Commissioner of Burma, and Mr. Hallett, a civil engineer and explorer. In 1879, the Indian government sent Mr. Colquhoun to the Shan States of Siam and Burma. Subsequently, in 1882, he traveled from Guangzhou to Bhamo, but he did not have time to survey the railway line from Moulmein to Simao. This task was undertaken by Mr. Hallett, who surveyed a route passing through Burma, Siam, and Yunnan, totaling 1,250 miles. After completing the survey in 1884, Mr. Colquhoun and Mr. Hallett met in Bangkok, Siam, and presented the plan to the King of Siam, as they believed the plan was of particular interest to Siam. However, the plan aroused widespread suspicion among the Siamese, who believed it was a tool to trap the King of Siam and make him a part of the Indian colony, and it was shelved. As a result, neither the King of Siam nor the Indian government was willing to provide financial assistance. Mr. Colquhoun resigned from his position in the Indian government to become a special correspondent for The Times in China. Later, Li Hongzhang sent him to India to meet Lord Dufferin, the Governor-General of India, to suggest that China and India should have telegraphic communication at the Bhamo border. This task was completed in 1895.

Unfortunately, the line chosen by Mr. Colquhoun and Mr. Hallett started from Moulmein, passed through Siam to Raheng, and then went north along the plains of the Menam River basin to Simao and Kunming in Yunnan. Although this line was the shortest route from the Bay of Bengal to Kunming, the area it passed through was unproductive, and all locations were below 4,000 feet, with a high prevalence of malaria-carrying mosquitoes, raising serious doubts about its commercial viability. None of the railways built today follow the line surveyed by Mr. Colquhoun and Mr. Hallett. The international commercial land route between Burma and Siam reaches Raheng along that line, but its passage is limited to the dry season.

However, the plan to build a railway from Burma to China did not end until the end of the last century. From 1894 to 1900, Major Davies, a British officer, surveyed Yunnan Province several times in search of a possible route. His book and maps about the region remain accurate and reliable works. In six years, he traveled 6,000 miles in Yunnan, conducting three surveys for the Indian government and two for the British Yunnan Company. Unfortunately, the final survey map for the Yunnan railway plan was lost when Captain Watts Jones was killed while carrying the plan to Beijing during the Boxer Rebellion. However, the survey of the Hsenwi crossing remains, and that location is where the current Burma Road crosses the Salween River to reach Xufu and Naxi in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, an area of rugged mountains nearly a thousand miles away, making travel extremely difficult. According to Davies' calculations, the entire project would cost £20 million and take ten years.

By the end of the 19th century, the world situation had changed, and the alliance between Britain and France brought an end to the Anglo-French rivalry in Siam and Yunnan. The Anglo-French agreement of 1896 resolved the border issues in Siam, Burma, and Yunnan. France completed the railway from Vietnam to Kunming in 1910 and did not extend the line to Dali, to avoid competition with the British commercial route to Burma. Since the overland trade between Yunnan and Burma did not experience significant development after 1900, Britain abandoned plans to extend the railway from Lashio to the Chinese border.

The Marco Polo Bridge Incident in July 1937 did not immediately affect southwestern China. Even after Japan attacked Shanghai and blockaded the southern Chinese ports, China did not realize the potential importance of its Yunnan access. It was not until the end of 1937, when China's coastal trade was severely restricted, that China began to build its famous lifeline to the southwest. The two main difficulties were terrain and climate. All of Burma and Yunnan south of Kunming have alternating rainy and dry seasons. The heavy rainy season begins in May and continues until mid-October. Some sections of the road receive up to 20 inches of rain annually. From December 1937 to March 1938, China built the roadbed from Dali to Namhkam on the Burmese border, and then the 750-mile highway from Kunming to Lashio was opened to traffic. In fact, some sections of the road had been passable for several years. The Kunming-to-Dali section was paved in 1933, and other sections could be traversed by heavy vehicles in the dry season, but the most difficult problem was crossing the Salween and Mekong River basins. Solving this problem took less than three months. A reporter for The Times of London said: "Only the Chinese could have built it in time."

The road was designed by Chinese engineers and funded by the central government with 2.5 million yuan and the Yunnan provincial government with 500,000 yuan. Many workers were conscripted to build the road, with estimates ranging from 150,000 to 350,000 laborers. Usually, 30,000 people worked daily to maintain the road. The ongoing work included installing culverts to ensure that vehicles could travel even during heavy rain. The official opening ceremony of the highway was held on January 10, 1939. Explosives and surveying instruments were the only modern road-building methods used. Much of the blasting work was done with bamboo tubes filled with gunpowder, topped with a crude fuse to detonate them. All the crushing of stones was done by hand with simple tools, and the road surface was flattened with stone rollers, which were also made by hand by using hammers and chisels to shape large stones.

Could the road withstand heavy vehicles during the rainy season? During the rainy season of 1939, there were only ten days of stoppages. A section of the road in the Mekong River gorge was blocked by a landslide. The road's traffic management was undertaken by the Southwest Transportation Company. Mr. Song Zi-liang was the company's manager. On June 23 of last year, Mr. Song Zi-liang met with a reporter from The Times of Rangoon and said that the company had thousands of American-made heavy vehicles, carrying military supplies back to China and tung oil, bristles, and leather to Burma for export. It took five days to travel from Kunming to the Burmese border, but the fastest trip could be completed in three days. (To be continued)

### Chinese Merchants Continuously Selling Foreign Exchange While Foreign Firms Actively Buy

Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: HSBC's listed price, announced at 9:30 AM, showed no change for British exchange, while the US exchange was listed at 1875, or 5.875 yuan. Other currencies like Dutch, Luxembourg, and Japanese exchange also uniformly eased. As for the domestic market situation, due to rampant rumors, it was quite unstable, fluctuating between easing and tightening. Initially, speculative traders showed signs of taking profits, causing a temporary softening, with the US exchange at 6.125 yuan. Subsequently, the prevalence of peace rumors, even stronger than the previous day, and reports of British Ambassador Kerr's arrival in Chongqing, led Chinese banks and merchants to rush to sell, causing a sharp easing in the market, with the US exchange rising to 6.3125 yuan. However, foreign firms showed an interest in buying, slightly leveling out the closing price in the afternoon. The market initially continued to soften, but speculative traders continued to sell. Soon, rumors of China joining the German-Soviet alliance surfaced, causing sellers to panic. At the same time, Sassoon and others showed an interest in buying, causing the price to rebound. The final closing prices were: British gold at 3 pence 99375, and US exchange at 6.1875 yuan, an increase of 0.03125 and 1.875 yuan respectively compared to the previous day's closing prices for British and US exchange.

The futures market followed a similar trend to the spot market; HSBC's US exchange was listed higher.

In the morning, London telegraphs showed an increase of 3125 for near-term and 25 for long-term. The US silver price remained unchanged. London raw gold remained unchanged. The exchange rate between British and US currencies was also unchanged, and the rate against Shanghai was also flat. The US dollar rose 1 angle and 3.75 points against the pound, and a large triangle against Shanghai. There was no market for the French franc. The Central Bank's listed prices for various currencies remained the same. In the morning, banks opened spot selling prices at 3 pence 84375 for British gold and 6.15625 yuan for US exchange, which was tighter by 0.0625 and softer by 0.15625 respectively compared to the previous day's closing. This was because the exchange rate rose sharply by 1 angle and 3.75 points. After the opening, exporters were the first to sell, hardening the market. It is estimated that HSBC bought shillings for the current month at 3 pence 875. HSBC's listed price was announced, with no change in British exchange and US exchange suspended at 5.875 yuan, an increase of 1.875. Other currencies such as Dutch, Luxembourg, and Japanese exchange also uniformly eased. The silver balancing tax was announced, increasing by 1.50%. Subsequently, speculative traders showed some appetite, and Sassoon came to buy, causing the price to turn soft. It is estimated that foreign and Chinese banks sold US exchange for July to speculative traders at 6.125 yuan, and for August at 6.09375 yuan. Furthermore, Sassoon absorbed the US exchange for August from Chinese and American banks, tightening it to 6.09375 and 0625, and the spot price retreated to 6.125 yuan. At about 9:45 AM, due to the strong atmosphere of peace and reports of British Ambassador Kerr's arrival in Chongqing, people were anxious, and Chinese banks and merchants tended to sell quite heavily, immediately hardening the market. Chinese banks and merchants sold US exchange for July to Youli and Datong at 6.1875 and 28125 yuan, and for August, they sold it to foreign firms at 6.25 yuan. The loosest spot US exchange was seen at 6.3125 yuan, and British gold was approximately 3 pence 792-875. However, by the afternoon closing, the market had recovered, as foreign firms like Youli frequently absorbed the currency. Shillings for July were traded at 3 pence 90625, and the closing prices were 3 pence 875 for British gold and 6.1875 yuan for US exchange, an increase of 0.03125 for both British and US exchange compared to the morning opening.

The after-market price turned stable again.

In the early afternoon, the market remained hard due to selling by Chinese merchants. It is estimated that Chinese banks absorbed US exchange for the current month from speculative traders at 6.25 and 28125 yuan, and US exchange for August at 6.21875 yuan. Later, rumors of China joining the German-Soviet alliance emerged, causing sellers to stop selling, and Sassoon came to buy again, causing the price to rebound. It is estimated that Sassoon bought US exchange for the current month at 6.25 yuan. The closing prices were 3 pence 9375 for British gold, 6.1875 yuan for US exchange, 3 pence 875 for British gold in August, and 6.125 yuan for US exchange in August, an increase of 0.03125 for British exchange and a hardening of 1.875 for US exchange compared to the previous day's closing spot prices, and a softening of 0.03125 for British exchange and a hardening of 1.875 for US exchange in August.

### Too Many Rumors; Unpredictable Gold Market Fluctuations

Yesterday's spot dark market fluctuated unpredictably, with people reacting to the rumors. The cash shops, most sensitive to the news, sold off a considerable amount throughout the day. In the early morning, due to the rise in exchange rates, the market opened lower at 5,230 yuan. Although it briefly rose by a few tens of yuan, it soon fell back to 5,180 yuan. However, the foreign exchange market suddenly softened, prompting securities firms and money changers to rush in, reaching a high of 5,305 yuan for the day. Unexpectedly, as peace rumors spread, operators were at a loss, causing a massive selling spree that almost broke the 5,000 yuan barrier, falling to 5,050 yuan. The afternoon closing was at 5,165 yuan, maintained by the gold shops. The afternoon saw a fall followed by a rise, then rumors emerged of China joining the German-Soviet alliance, causing the foreign exchange market to tighten and the gold price to follow. Securities firms and money changers bought more, and the closing price was 5,200 yuan, a decrease of 180 yuan compared to the previous day. The total volume of transactions was approximately 3,000 taels. Jewelry gold shops initially lowered prices, then raised them, ultimately reducing them by a small amount of ten yuan. Customs gold and other prices remained stable.

Spot Gold Fell by 180 Yuan

Starting in the morning, due to the rise in US exchange, which was due to the increase of 1 angle and 3.75 points in the US-UK exchange rate, gold shops initially sold ten taels to money changers, with the opening price at 5,230 yuan. Later, as the foreign exchange market remained stable, silver shops and money changers aggressively pulled up the price, rising slightly, with gold shops buying ten taels from silver shops for 5,270 yuan. However, soon gold shops started selling off, and the market weakened again, with securities firms selling twenty taels to money changers for 5,180 yuan. Suddenly, news of a softening foreign exchange market emerged, prompting securities firms and money changers to uniformly buy in, rising beyond the 5,300 yuan level, with gold shops and money changers buying thirty taels from silver shops for 5,305 yuan. However, due to the intense atmosphere of peace and the sharp rise in foreign exchange rates,

a massive selling spree was triggered, and the price collapsed, falling close to the 5,000 yuan barrier. Money changers sold twenty taels to silver shops and gold shops for 5,050 yuan. Before the afternoon closing, gold shops saw the low prices and absorbed the supply, starting to raise the price by more than one hundred yuan, with gold shops buying ten taels from silver shops, with the afternoon closing price at 5,165 yuan. In the early afternoon, the market was still stable, and silver shops initially sold ten taels to gold shops for 5,155 yuan. Later, as the foreign exchange market continued to harden, gold shops came to sell, causing a fall of more than fifty yuan due to a lack of buyers. Silver shops sold twenty taels to securities firms for 5,100 yuan. However, soon, rumors of China joining the German-Soviet alliance emerged, agitating the market, and securities firms and money changers all bought in, suddenly rising beyond 5,200 yuan, with gold shops buying twenty taels from silver shops for 5,230 yuan. As a result, money changers sold ten taels to silver shops, with the closing price at 5,200 yuan, a decrease of 180 yuan compared to the previous day. The total fluctuation range for the day was approximately 255 yuan. The selling price of spot gold from cash shops was several tens of yuan higher than the spot price, and the buying price was reduced by thirty yuan. The current bid price was more than fifty yuan lower than the listed price, and trading was rare.

Jewelry Gold Only Listed a Small Amount of Ten Yuan

At silver jewelry stores, the asking price for each tael initially remained at 550 yuan at Da Tong Heng. At 9:30 AM, it was reduced by a small amount of ten yuan. At 10:15 AM, it was lowered by another ten yuan. At 11:00 AM, it fell by another ten yuan. At noon, it rose back up by ten yuan. At 4:00 PM in the evening, it rose again by ten yuan. As a result, it was reduced by a small amount of ten yuan, with Da Tong Heng changing the price to 540 yuan. The new shops had similar prices, and the buying price was reduced by about thirty yuan.

### Foreign Currencies Fluctuated Wildly

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw spot gold fluctuate unpredictably, ultimately trending downwards. British and US gold pounds also fell by 3.5 yuan each. British gold notes were in high demand, and the price rose by 6 angles. US gold notes initially retreated to 16.15 yuan due to the sharp rise in the pound price. After the opening, various parties showed eager demand, steadily rising to 3 angles and a half. Subsequently, the atmosphere of peace suddenly emerged, retreating to 15.8 yuan at one point. At noon, it rebounded to 16 yuan. The early afternoon was still stable, but suddenly rumors emerged that China would join the German-Soviet alliance, causing the market atmosphere to tighten again. The evening market rose to 16.25 yuan, but still fell by 3 angles compared to the previous day. Hong Kong notes had a slight supply, and the market price was slightly weak by 2 points. Robi, Canadian, Philippine, and other notes also had ample supply, and the market price uniformly trended softer. The demand for Japanese gold notes decreased sharply, and the evening market retreated to 1.23 yuan. Korean notes had a balanced supply and demand, and the market price remained stable. The evening market was still at 1 yuan and 5 li.

Hong Kong US Exchange Fluctuated

Hong Kong, 16th (Tuesday) telegram: The exchange market opened flat this morning. The US exchange fluctuated unpredictably. The spot price for British exchange was unchanged, and the forward price was still not opened. The spot price for US exchange rose by 5625 to 23.625 yuan (yesterday's closing price was 23.0625 yuan). The spot price for Shanghai exchange remained open at the original price of 381 yuan (yesterday's closing price). The spot price for Japanese exchange eased by 2.5 yuan to 100 yuan and 5 angles.

### Grain: Foreign Rice Continues to Flood In, Falling by More Than Ten Yuan; Yesterday's Market Was Even Weaker

Since the implementation of price controls, the rice market has taken a sharp turn downwards. In the past two weeks, it has been falling sharply without any rebound. Compared to the highest peak at the time, the prices of everything from high-quality to low-quality goods have fallen drastically by 11-12 yuan to a huge 14-15 yuan. Among them, the recent two-day decline has been even more severe, with a real sense of a precipitous drop. Yesterday, a large batch of incoming foreign rice continued to arrive. Yesterday, Jardine Matheson's Yisheng also transported 16,121 bags from Hong Kong, stopping at the Roosevelt Pier for unloading. Swire Shipping's Shandong, which arrived in Shanghai the evening before yesterday, also brought 12,996 bags from Hong Kong, stopping at its own pier in Pudong for unloading. Moreover, the period for price controls is approaching, and the situation remains the same. At the opening of the market in the morning, not only were sellers increasingly eager to sell, but the sales floor had virtually no rice to deliver. However, under these circumstances, sellers were still trying to solicit appetite, causing the market to drop again and again. From morning to noon, the prices of various types of foreign rice fell sharply by another two or three yuan. Only at this time did retailers and wholesalers seize the opportunity to move goods at low prices, and the situation felt slightly more active. However, time was short, and the market closed soon after without any change. Statistical results at closing: No. 1 Saigon old rice was only 54 yuan, No. 2 was 51.5 yuan, No. 1 Sen Lo was 54 yuan, No. 2 was 51.5 yuan, 51 yuan, Fire Twisted was 53 yuan, Hong Kong Pointed was 52.5 yuan, followed by 50 yuan, Small Twisted was 51.5 yuan, Tokyo Pointed was 47-8 yuan, followed by Category Coarse was 44-5 yuan, Zhu Pointed was 41 yuan, followed by 39.5 yuan, Category Broken was 37 yuan, Rice Green was 43 yuan and 42 yuan, and the spot price for No. 2 Saigon had already fallen to 62 yuan, and the June 20th Luo No. 2 fell to 61.5 yuan, down 3.6 yuan from the previous day, and the 26th load fell by 4.4 yuan, because the previous closing was 65 yuan, while yesterday it fell from 61.5 yuan to 60 yuan and 06 angles at closing. The spot market was also sluggish because the inland transshipment was completely blocked. The street was also sluggish due to low-priced sales, with only over 2,000 bags traded and less than 300 tons returned.

Although the arrival of japonica and glutinous domestic rice continued to be limited, the overall situation was extremely weak. Whether in the official or unofficial markets, rumors indicated declines, and both trading and selling prices continued to depreciate by one or two yuan. Regular Special Clear japonica was 67.5 yuan and 67 yuan, Su Kun Changzhou White Stalk japonica was high at 64-5 yuan, followed by 62-3 yuan, Qing Si Thin Rice was 65-6 yuan, Nan Gang Early and Late japonica was 62-3 yuan, Glutinous Rice Jin Li Special Yuan was 63 yuan, Chang Dan Loan was 61 yuan for retail, followed by 59 yuan.

### Rice Prices Softened; Flour Sales Decreased; Little Excitement in Wheat

Flour: Yesterday's flour market was particularly soft and weak.

Since the No. 2 Flour Mill's price rose to 16 yuan, although Chinese mills were able to provide widespread supply, the actual sales in the street have decreased rather than increased. This is because flour is currently more expensive than rice, and the common people are paying attention to eating rice. It is said that the quantity released by the Fu and Fu factories was only five or six thousand bags. Other Japanese and inland flour were also affected by the dumping of foreign flour and the sharp drop in rice prices. The opening prices were generally soft and weak. For example, the spot price of Phoenix brand initially opened at 15 yuan and 3 angles, but later softened to 15 yuan and 2 angles. The August futures also only opened at 15 yuan and 3 angles, and the September futures opened at 15 yuan and 4 angles, all of which were slightly lower than the previous prices. Jinshan brand flour was priced at 16 yuan and 5 angles due to the decline in goods. Double Lion had no transactions. It is said that the inventory of inland flour among flour merchants is no longer high.

Wheat: There was even less excitement in the new wheat market. Upon inspection, the arrival of vehicles and ships has not been interrupted. About 10,000 bags arrive in Hongkou from Beijing and Shanghai every day, mostly allocated to Japanese mills. It is said that the output from various producing areas has been gradually increasing recently, and the price has also been falling. Therefore, Shanghai flour mills are all intending to take Australian wheat instead. Chinese mills are having difficulty transporting domestic wheat, so they have ordered another ship of Australian wheat at a price of slightly over 31 yuan.

### Securities and Participation: Demand Exceeds Supply; Domestic Debt Surge Intensifies; Foreign Stock Trading Is Also Active

Securities market situation: Yesterday's unified public bonds experienced turbulent waves. Continuing the upward momentum from the previous day, the surge became even more pronounced. Although it is still too early to tell whether the various peace rumors reported in the news will materialize, they have failed to curb the perception of positive sentiment among general speculators. Therefore, people were excited, and buyers came one after another. In particular, the sharp softening of foreign exchange rates and the sharp decline in gold prices further excited participation firms. As a result, large investors bought in large quantities, and the demand was huge, while sellers were panicking and feeling uneasy. This led to a shortage of chips on the counter, with demand far exceeding supply. The market became increasingly bullish, creating a rare surge in months. At the opening in the morning, the market rapidly surged upwards with a firm selling trend. Although Xie Da, Jiu Feng, Lian Yi, Hong Kang, and others successively supplied the market, there was not enough for everyone. Therefore, Yi Qin, Shun Heng, Da Feng, Yuan Chang, and others persistently bought in, driving up the market. In the afternoon, there were even fewer sellers. Only Hong Da, Lian He, and Jiu Feng released some holdings, while Da Feng, Le Mao, Tong Kang, and Lian Yi continued to aggressively advance, and the price rose again. However, Class A stocks were slightly stable. The result of the day's fluctuations was a uniform surge of 8.5 angles to a huge 1.35 yuan. Total transactions were estimated to be slightly over 1.5 million yuan. A brief table is listed on the left.

Stock trading: Xianghua Electric Company shares, 50 shares, price at 42.2 yuan.

Also, the Public Industry Association reported that yesterday's stock market opened quite soft, and the trend was turbulent and difficult to determine. Until the last few minutes before the close of the afternoon, the buying trend suddenly turned strong again. Public sentiment was still difficult to suppress. It can be seen that all stocks closed under huge trading volume and a firm and rising situation. The news circulating throughout the day was still very complex. The market's sentiment suddenly turned optimistic. Besides relying on the two factors of "loose and excessive credit" and "good dividend outlook," it is very difficult to find other reasons.

London, 15th (Monday) telegram: Today's listed prices of Chinese foreign debts saw a further decline in the upper range. The Reorganization Loan British-issued bonds fell by 4 pounds, priced at 2,000 pounds. The Anglo-German Continuing Loan British-issued bonds fell by 3 pounds, priced at 40 pounds. The Crisp Loan bonds fell by 2 pounds, priced at 15 pounds. The Anglo-French Loan British-issued bonds fell by 1 pound, priced at 43 pounds. In the lower range, only the Longhai Railway public bonds fell by 3 pounds, priced at 8 pounds. The rest saw no gains or losses.

London, 15th (Monday) telegram: Today's listed prices of Far East British companies' stocks were generally stable. The market showed no changes.

### Yarn and Cotton: Coastal Ports Were Sealed; Foreign Markets Fell Sharply; Double Horse Lowest Price Seen at 885 Yuan

The yarn market was very weak, and the decline was severe. This was because there were reports that the Japanese side had blockaded the coastal ports of Zhejiang and Fujian, and shipping was suspended, making freight transport difficult. General bullish sentiment was uneasy. In addition, foreign firms were releasing long positions, and the probability of peace was high. Furthermore, in the past two days, bulls had gradually pulled up prices, and the market price had been gradually rising. Everyone was targeting price increases. Regardless of size, everyone had bought a few bags to trade and make a profit. Unexpectedly, a change occurred, and the reaction was even more intense, causing the bulls to uniformly liquidate their positions. The market fell more and more fiercely, directly breaking through the 1,000 yuan barrier. The lowest price reached 885 yuan, a huge drop of 145 yuan from the previous day.

The current yarn market opened this morning with a fierce storm. Because customer firms were unable to load goods, the goods that had been declared yesterday had already been returned. At the same time, gold was falling, and foreign exchange rates were softening, making people uneasy. Twenty-count Double Horse opened 60 yuan lower at 970 yuan. As soon as this price opened, sellers rushed to sell. The price fell directly to 920 yuan. The price briefly rebounded to 940 yuan, but then it was heard that customer sales had stopped, and morale was low. The price fell again to 915 yuan at closing. However, after the closing, the low price of 885 yuan was seen again. Upon checking the trading statistics for half a day, 1,730 bags were traded. The market price of 20-count Double Horse fell sharply by 115 yuan. Three hundred and fifty pieces of yarn were shipped to Hong Kong today. The amount of purchases made by each customer group is listed below:

### Yarn Prices Plummeted; Cotton Market Stalled

Spot cotton trading has entered a state of stagnation again. Both Chinese and foreign factories have taken no action. This is because the plummeting yarn prices have temporarily halted the purchase of raw cotton. As a result, morale is low, and the market is trending downwards.

In other news, the foreign cotton market price, the New York cotton market, was very quiet. Later, due to purchases by peers and some short covering, the closing price resulted in all months rising by 2 points, except for July, which fell by 2 points. The Indian market was quiet. Yesterday, including predictions, the price rose slightly by half a robi.

Shanghai's foreign cotton trading, yesterday, due to the strong rumors of peace in the market and the news that Ningbo and Wenzhou also prohibited ships from traveling, and the plummeting price of released yarn, foreign cotton trading was also sluggish. All parties are taking a wait-and-see attitude. The afternoon's atmosphere of peace turned weak again, and activity among peers slightly increased, so it is predicted that the market may improve today.

### Piece Goods: Zhejiang and Fujian Freight Transport Halted; Cloth Prices Plunged

Domestic Cloth: Yesterday, the cloth market suddenly saw ships being prevented from clearing customs at the Zhejiang and Fujian seaports. Coupled with the prevalence of certain rumors, the exchange market suddenly saw a sharp rise, and morale was greatly relaxed. Various goods were sold off preemptively. Customer groups from Zhejiang and Fujian also resold various goods that had been ordered in the market, further exacerbating the state of oversupply. Cloth prices plummeted. White cloth fell by 5 angles to 1 yuan per bolt, and bleached and dyed cloth also fell by about 1 yuan. Prices were very chaotic. Trading by coastal customer groups on Pu Road was almost halted. Only the Hong Kong and Nanyang groups added several hundred bolts of twill-colored cloth and colored twill. The trading of split goods and joint purchases by inland groups in the street was still continuous. However, in view of the plummeting cloth prices, interest in buying was extremely low, and storage households also sold more and bought less. It is estimated that over 200 pieces of various goods were traded.

Eastern Cloth: Yesterday, due to the sharp drop in yarn prices and the shift in morale, 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth opened and immediately fell to 28.78 yuan. It briefly rebounded to 29.18 yuan, then fell back to 18.6 yuan. Later, due to the excessive decline, Eastern Cotton, Ito, and other firms bought in, and the price rose again to 29 yuan at closing. Four Gentlemen Serge sold at a minimum price of 8 angles 4 points and 7 li and a half. The afternoon transaction price also rebounded to 8 angles and 5 points and a half.

Shipments: Today, 254 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Hong Kong.

### Sugar Market: Both Coarse and Refined Whites Saw Slight Rebounds

Yesterday's sugar market was affected by a certain atmosphere and rising foreign exchange rates. In addition, Zhejiang and Fujian seaports were blockaded by a certain party, making morale extremely weak and causing prices to fall. The association's listed prices: Spot 24 Coarse White, Main Warehouse was 67.5 yuan to 67 yuan, down 1 yuan. Foreign Warehouse goods in the morning were 67.3 yuan to 67 yuan, down about 1 yuan. In the afternoon, they were 66.5 yuan, down a small amount. Transshipment goods, i.e., those that were directly warehoused, were 52.1 yuan to 52 yuan, down 1.56 yuan. The price for delivery on the 22nd was 53.1 yuan to 52.7 yuan in the morning, and 52.4 yuan in the afternoon, down 1.2 yuan. Dutch Red was 57.7 yuan, down 3 angles. This mill's Snow White was 68, and this ice was unchanged. Chinese Grain had Guang gang opening with 90 bags of Dongxiang Red, priced at 52 yuan. Also, yesterday, 603 bags of sugar came from Xiamen.

### Metals Black Iron Billets Still Quoted at 1,000 Yuan

The trade of black iron billets is primarily driven by the thermos factories, mirror factories, iron printing factories, and canneries in this area. However, recently, due to a significant decline in the thermos product business, the procurement of raw materials has also been sluggish. Additionally, operations by other factories are also limited. Furthermore, out-of-town merchants' demand has stalled, leading to a sluggish market. Nevertheless, people are resisting lowering prices due to obstructed supply routes, leading to speculative thoughts. Quotations remain around 1,000 yuan, although it is heard that transactions at 970 to 980 yuan are also quite common in secret.

### Following the Blockade of Various Ports in Fujian and Zhejiang, Foreign Vessels Are Forced to Suspend Navigation; Japanese Side Announces Commencement of Action This Morning; Fierce Artillery Battle at Zhenhai, Japanese Warships Fail; Shipping Companies of Various Countries Including German, Italian, and British Demand Strict Negotiations from Respective Consulates

Since Admiral Shimada, Commander of the Japanese Fleet in China, announced the closure of coastal ports in Zhejiang and Fujian from Hangzhou Bay to the vicinity of Fuzhou, according to the English-language Da Mei Wan Bao, the press corps of the Japanese Fleet in China announced again at 11:30 AM today (July 16) that a Japanese naval unit, including warships, marines, and aircraft, began operations in the Hangzhou Bay area on Tuesday morning. It is noted that the Chinese side had already assembled a large army in the area in preparation for battle.

Heavy Damage Inflicted on the Japanese in the Zhenhai Artillery Battle

Yesterday, a reporter from the Píngmíng News Agency inquired with well-informed sources among the Ningbo compatriots in Shanghai and learned that a certain shipping company in Shanghai had received a telegram yesterday morning stating that an artillery battle had broken out at Zhenhai Port since dawn. However, the details were not specified. Subsequently, other related parties also received news of the Zhenhai artillery battle. By 6:00 PM, a telegram from Ningbo stated that several Japanese warships had surrounded Zhenhai Port since dawn yesterday. At 8:00 AM, they suddenly bombarded the Zhenhai Fort. The Chinese army also opened fire with heavy artillery from the fort, hitting many Japanese warships, inflicting heavy damage. The artillery battle continued until 3:00 PM and had not yet ceased. According to another telegram received by Ningbo compatriots in Shanghai at 5:00 PM yesterday afternoon, in addition to the Zhenhai artillery battle, five Japanese aircraft were circling over Zhenhai for reconnaissance. The air raid alarm in Zhenhai and Ningbo had not been lifted as of 4:00 PM yesterday afternoon. However, according to various frequent reports received by well-informed sources among Ningbo compatriots in Shanghai, there was no news of bombings by Japanese aircraft.

British Consulate Decides to Lodge Serious Protest

Yesterday, a reporter from the Xīnshēng News Agency obtained reliable information: (1) German and Italian shipping companies have jointly reported to their respective consulates in Shanghai, requesting swift negotiations with Japan to resume navigation and are awaiting orders from their consulates. (2) The British Consul in Shanghai convened relevant British shipping companies at 10:00 AM yesterday to discuss everything and reportedly decided to lodge a serious protest with the Japanese authorities to maintain British shipping interests in China. The attitude of all parties in Shanghai is extremely calm, closely monitoring the development of the situation. It is generally believed that the Japanese action is purely a form of intimidation. According to reliable sources in the shipping industry, the Japanese ship Daishanmaru, which regularly sailed the Shanghai-Dinghai route, has been missing since disappearing, with no news or trace of it to date. On the afternoon of the 11th, more than 150 Japanese marines boarded a ship to invade Daxie Island in Dinghai County and Chuanshan Township in Zhenhai County, engaging in fierce fighting with the local Chinese army. After an hour of stalemate, the Japanese army, unable to land, immediately fled. This was actually a trial run before the Japanese announced the blockade of the Zhejiang and Fujian coast.

Shipping Between Shanghai, Fujian, and Zhejiang Severed

After Admiral Shimada Shigetarō, Commander of the Japanese Fleet in China, announced the blockade of the Zhejiang and Fujian coast at 10:00 AM the day before yesterday, the Japanese Customs Officer of the Jianghai Customs has specified the prohibition of ships traveling to and from five ports: (1) Ningbo, (2) Wenzhou, (3) Fuzhou, (4) Sanduao, (5) Hanjiang (i.e., Xinghua Port). The General Affairs Section of the Customs has also stopped clearing ships sailing from Shanghai to the above five ports since yesterday. Therefore, navigation between Shanghai and Fujian and Zhejiang has been severed. The four ships Ruitai, Changtai, Ave Maria, and Jiangsu, which were scheduled to sail from Shanghai to Ningbo the day before yesterday, temporarily suspended their departure. The Hana, which was scheduled to sail from Shanghai to Wenzhou yesterday, also suspended its departure because the customs refused to clear it. The four ships Haifu, Shantai, Jiangding, and Gaodeng, which were returning to Shanghai from Ningbo yesterday morning, sailed out of the Zhenhai Port blockade line at 7:00 AM and were intercepted by Japanese warships seven nautical miles from Qili Island. They anchored there and negotiated with the Japanese warships. The Japanese warships ordered the four ships to sign a statement promising not to come here again (i.e., Zhenhai Port) next time. The negotiations concluded at about 11:00 AM, and the four ships simultaneously weighed anchor and sailed to Shanghai, expected to arrive in port this morning. The Moufu, owned by the German company Reiss & Co., is currently at Haimen and is scheduled to depart for Shanghai this morning, expected to arrive in port tomorrow morning.

Ships Sailing to Fujian Return to Shanghai One After Another

The Xinghua and Quanzhou ships sailing to Fujian, including those of the British company Jardine Matheson, have reportedly telegraphed that their ships Shenyou and Shenai have safely arrived in Quanzhou to unload cargo. After the cargo is unloaded, they will return to Shanghai. The Shenfu is still planning to sail from Shanghai to Xinghua and Quanzhou, but no ships are currently sailing to Fuzhou and Sanduao. The Yongfeng and Yongtai, owned by the British company Dodwell & Co., and managed by Fuxing Company, were inspected by Japanese warships when they sailed from Shanghai to Quanzhou and have recently sailed from Quanzhou to Shanghai. It is reported that they will arrive in Shanghai soon. All foreign ships from Shanghai to Wenzhou have been forced to temporarily suspend navigation. It is reported that ships anchored in Wenzhou, such as the Baoli, owned by the Italian company Wah Yih, the Feikang, owned by the German company Ruilin, and the Xinan, owned by the British company Dodwell & Co., have been ordered not to load cargo in Wenzhou and are preparing to sail out of the Oujiang River estuary and return to Shanghai empty. There are currently no ships sailing to Rui’an, Pingyang, Leqing, and Haimen in Jiaojiang.

Notice of Suspension of Parcel Post to Zhejiang and Fujian

Parcel Post Administration Notice: Due to the disruption of shipping lines in Fujian, all parcels and small packages destined for Zhejiang, Fujian, and transiting through those areas shall be suspended from acceptance. However, parcels destined for Xiamen and Hangzhou (including all bureaus under Hangzhou's jurisdiction) will continue to be accepted as usual.

Trade Situation in Ningbo and Wenzhou Ports

Customs officials have learned that since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, most coastal ports in China have been blockaded by the Japanese, and only a few places such as Ningbo, Wenzhou, and Sanduao can still freely navigate. As a result, trade in these ports has suddenly become prosperous, and the numbers are astonishing. Last year, Ningbo's exports were 9,816,000 yuan, an increase of 1,636 times compared to the 6,000 yuan in 1936. Imports decreased by one-tenth. Wenzhou's imports last year were 2,765,000 yuan, an increase of nine times compared to 1936, and exports were 2,779,000 yuan, an increase of 87.25 times compared to 1936. The export value of Sanduao from January to May this year was 1,778,000 yuan, which is also an increase of more than 24 times compared to the same period last year.

### Japanese Troops Conduct Urban Warfare Drills in Nanshi, Unprecedented in Scale

Japanese troops and military police in Nanshi, starting at 6:00 PM on the 15th, piled up sandbags, barbed wire, and other obstacles in the area of Xieqiao, Lujiabang Road, Chezhan Road, Hugunjing, Nanmatou, and South Huangpu Bund. Residents were suspicious upon seeing this. Then, at 6:00 AM yesterday morning, more than 300 Japanese military police and troops and 20 small tanks suddenly arrived from the western suburbs of South Shanghai. After gathering in the open space of Penglai Road and Penglai Market, they divided into sections and deployed guards in the above-mentioned areas and alleys, cutting off traffic. At that time, the iron gate of Xieqiao in the French Concession was also temporarily closed. When the Japanese troops completed their deployment, they immediately began a large-scale urban warfare drill. Rifles and machine guns were even fired at the same time to test combat. Residents in the southern district near the French Concession could clearly hear the gunshots, which lasted for ninety minutes before they ended and dispersed, restoring traffic. However, since the Japanese side announced the opening of the area east of Rihui Port, this large-scale urban warfare drill is a new development.

Two More Grenades Thrown in Front of the Gate

Unexpectedly, just after the first grenade was thrown, there were two more explosions in front of our newspaper's gate. According to eyewitnesses, several other thugs, wearing different styles of long and short shirts, threw two grenades in succession at the gate of our newspaper at the corner of Hankou Road and Wangping Street immediately after the first grenade was thrown.

Security Guard Chases and Captures One Person

At that time, Han Weixiu (45 years old, from Shandong), the security guard number 870 of our newspaper, had already been injured in the face and legs by shrapnel, with blood flowing freely. Still, he was able to bravely rush out while injured in a moment of crisis, drew his gun, and chased after the thugs, chasing north to the corner of Erma Road and Wangping Street. Two plainclothes detectives happened to come towards him, assisting in the arrest of one of the thugs, wearing a Palis long shirt, a straw hat, and in his thirties. He was immediately taken to the police station for strict interrogation.

Many Innocent Passersby Injured

The shrapnel from the two grenades thrown by the thugs in front of our newspaper's gate was scattered on the road.

Grateful for Condolences from All Parties

Since the occurrence of this incident, we have received condolences to our newspaper, and our colleagues are extremely grateful for the warm encouragement from society. Our newspaper's attitude has always been solemn and upright. It is truly regrettable that we have been attacked by thugs.

### News from Hangzhou: Chinese Troops Active, Hand Grenades Thrown Inside New World, Fierce Fighting Near Moganshan

According to the North China Daily News, news from Hangzhou states that on the night of the 6th of this month, inside the New World Amusement Park, which also operates gambling, on the bank of West Lake, someone suddenly threw three hand grenades into the crowd, none of which exploded. However, tourists were terrified and fled out the door, causing great chaos, resulting in several people losing their footing, falling to the ground, and being trampled to death. Dozens of people were seriously injured. The thrower escaped into the crowd. The city gates were closed tightly for two days, and trains were not allowed to leave the station, in an attempt to capture the grenade thrower, but to no avail. This incident occurred on the eve of the "July 7th" Incident anniversary, and many believe it is the beginning of the Chinese side's advance to drive the Japanese troops out of the Hangzhou area before the end of summer. Fierce fighting near Moganshan has been going on for more than a month. According to Japanese sources in Hangzhou, the Chinese troops in the area are the 10th, 192nd, and 180th Special Divisions under Bai Chongxi.

Results of the Fierce Battle

The Chinese troops have captured an area ten to fifteen miles long on both the north and south sides of Moganshan. Heavy artillery from both Chinese and Japanese armies is active, exchanging fire across the river in recent days. Villages can be seen on fire from the mountain peaks. The Qiantang River Railway Bridge, which was destroyed by the Chinese army, is now being repaired by the Japanese army. Troops can now cross on foot and head to the other side.

### Chinese Members of the French Concession Rent Investigation Committee Recommend Adjusting Rent Survey Principles, Investigation Committee Held First Meeting Yesterday, French Consul-General Attended, Agreed to Establish Five Subgroups

The Rent Investigation Committee, established by the French Municipal Council according to Decree No. 270 of the French Consul-General's Office, held its first meeting at 10:00 AM yesterday in the meeting hall of the Municipal Council. Attendees included French Consul-General Eugène Augé, Chairman of the Rent Committee d'Houghe, Secretary M. Ricard, Chinese members Qu Zhenhua, Zhu Wende, Wang Runsheng, Lan Xuzhang, Xu Jiashi, French members M. Banaud, M. Pontet, M. Fredet, British members H. A. Reeks, R. D. K. Silby, American member P. M. Anderson, Russian members A. I. Slohodtekikoff, I. A. Yavdinsky, Nicolas J. Fomin. The meeting began with a report from the French Consul-General on the purpose of the meeting, followed by the introduction of the national members and the designation of d'Houghe as Chairman of the Committee. Next, the tasks of the committee members were explained, and it was immediately agreed to form five subgroups: (1) Chinese Committee, (2) French Committee, (3) British Committee, (4) American Committee, (5) Russian Committee. The national members of this committee are the national committees of their respective countries. In addition, a mixed Owners Committee and Tenants Committee consisting of the five countries will be formed. Currently, each subgroup will conduct its own investigation meetings, prepare records, report to the general meeting, attach opinions, and submit them to the French Consul-General for review to establish a principle. Afterwards, if people of any country have

Rent Disputes

The Rent Committee will resolve them based on this principle. It is also heard that the Chinese members, in order to gather ideas, have designated the French Concession Chinese Taxpayers Association at 213 Central China Building, French Concession, as the communication address. If the Chinese have any opinions or suggestions on rent matters, they can submit them in writing to that address. The Chinese members Shi Wende, Qu Zhenhua, and Wang Runsheng have prepared a proposal on the advantages and disadvantages of rent surveys and submitted it to the committee. They recommend passive remedies, referring to French legislation and the methods of the Chinese Rent Assessment Committee, and based on the actual market conditions of the concession, formulate interim measures for adjusting rent prices in the French Concession and forward them to

All levels of courts for temporary adoption. The principles of the interim measures are as follows: (1) The monthly rent received by the landlord for the house should not exceed a certain percentage of the total value of the house and land (the total value of the house and land shall be based on the Municipal Council's valuation). (2) The rent for sub-rented houses by tenants should also be proportionally calculated, and the profit should not exceed a certain percentage. (3) When the house must be rebuilt, the leasing relationship between the landlord and the tenant should be maintained, and the rent for the new house in the future must also be handled in accordance with the first principle. (4) Water, donation, and electricity fees can be calculated outside the scope of the rent. (5) Rents previously collected exceeding the maximum amount should be reduced to the maximum amount in the future. (6) It is forbidden to collect tips, key money, and other unearned benefits, and those who violate this shall be subject to appropriate sanctions. (7) When the fixed-term lease expires, the tenant should be given the right to renew the lease, in line with Chinese customs. (8) The security deposit (commonly known as rent deposit) paid by the tenant should not exceed a certain number of months of rent. The above eight principles seem to be essential for correcting current rental disputes. Whether they are feasible, please decide.

### Italian Marines to Leave Shanghai for Tianjin: Italian Embassy Denies Italian Troops Withdrawing from Shanghai

According to the English-language "China Press," sources reported this morning (the 16th) that at the request of Fu Xiaoan, the 350 Italian Marine Corps stationed in Shanghai will leave Shanghai within a few days. It is said that Fu Xiaoan sent letters to the British, French, and Italian consulates in Shanghai last month, requesting the troops of these three countries to

withdraw from Shanghai

on the grounds that "the three countries are at war in Europe, and the presence of their troops in Shanghai violates China's neutrality." The French Consulate did not respond. Italian Consul General Niron and British Consul General George replied separately that they would forward the request to

the appropriate authorities. However, the rumor of the Italian troops withdrawing from Shanghai was not confirmed by Italian officials in the city this morning. The Italian Embassy even added a denial, saying that the rumor was absolutely untrue. Lieutenant Colonel Morandi, the commander of the Italian forces in Shanghai, said that he could not comment on the rumor, nor did he

deny it.

According to what the reporter heard, the preparations by the Italian authorities in the city for the withdrawal of Italian troops from Shanghai to Tianjin were completed on Sunday.

### Petain Takes Office as Head of State of France: French Ambassador Has Received Official Order: Cosme Has Telegraphed the National Government for Verification: French侨 In This City Remain Silent

In the modern history of European politics, one of the most shocking pages is the recent history of democratic France. The war against Germany has ended in defeat. The Anglo-French Allied Forces, which have historical significance in the European War, have announced their separation. What is even more impressive is that this nation, which loves freedom, has suddenly become a dictatorship. The ruthless liquidation of history can be said to have reached its extreme. According to the provisions of the Constitution of July 10 this year, Petain's assumption of the office of Head of State of France is to implement the reorganization. Petain took office on the following day. Now, the French Embassy in this city has received the official order of Petain's assumption of office as Head of State. After receiving the order, French Ambassador Cosme has telegraphed the National Government regarding Petain's assumption of office as Head of State for verification.

General Trends in the Psychology of French侨

French侨 in this city are generally concerned about the fate of their motherland. Now, France is forced into this tragic situation, so they all remain silent. Moreover, because they are far overseas, it is inevitable that they are isolated from the situation in their motherland. Therefore, they can only trust the government, do their best in their respective positions, and place their hopes for revival in the future. However, given the French people's love of freedom and equality, their inner suffering is self-evident. This can also be seen in the tragic speech delivered by French Ambassador Cosme on the French National Day on the 14th of this month. His speech roughly said: "Our country's experience has confused our minds. France's participation in the war is not only for its own benefit, but also to protect the survival of small countries. However, the enemy's military strength has made it impossible for it to resist, and it has finally led to defeat. In the current painful situation, there is no need to discuss the causes and consequences of the failure. As for the course of events, we can only see its reflection. It is also difficult to fathom the intentions of those in power. Today, we must remain silent. The people are like individuals, and only those who can overcome difficulties can be called great. Countries around the world are watching us with attention. I urge you in all sincerity not to make remarks that attack the past or doubt the future. We are far away from our motherland and do not fully understand the disasters of our country. Instead of making meaningless speculations, it is better to trust the spirit of our nation. Because we bury ourselves in work, obey discipline, and pray to God, we will eventually make our country revive. Before I part with you, I would like to ask you to remember the soldiers who died in battle. The soldiers who died in battle in 1940 and the victims of 1918 all had the ambition to make the greatest sacrifice for their motherland. Today is National Day, and we all have 缟素 in our minds. Therefore, I propose that you remain silent for one minute to commemorate the blood-stained patriots on the front line." His words were painful, and his intentions were far-reaching, which is enough to represent the psychology of the general French侨 in this city.

### Shaoxiao Disaster Relief Association Continues to Remit Over 100,000 Yuan

After the Shaoxiao Disaster Relief Association remitted 120,000 yuan to Shaoxing last month to organize porridge distribution, on the 9th of this month, it received another telegram from the disaster area in Shaoxing, requesting continued remittance of large sums of money for relief. Therefore, it has recently continued to remit 105,000 yuan, which will be used by the local disaster relief association to continue porridge distribution. The received donations will soon be exhausted. If the fellow villagers do not continue to donate generously, the disaster relief work will be interrupted. According to Zhong Jiya, coastal transportation has been forced to be interrupted recently, but the relief work in Shaoxiao is not interrupted because of this. Because the disaster relief work does not require purchasing foreign rice in Shanghai and transporting it to Shaoxing, because the price of foreign rice is more expensive than Zhejiang rice. Therefore, the transportation is blocked, and the remittance of funds to Shaoxing for relief does not cause any problems.

### Mental Health Promotion Association (Part 1)

— Shui Mo

Human mental life is complex and intricate. This inner psychological change is like a small boat sailing in the sea. A helmsman who is not good at driving a boat not only faces the danger of touching the lookout in the vast ocean, but also the possibility of sinking in the storm. To help overcome the crisis of this spiritual sea, that relies on the lighthouse that indicates in the darkness.

This lighthouse also shines in the Shanghai terminal; the watchman of the tower light not only wants to shine on the whole of Shanghai, but also hopes to shine on the entire China.

This is the aspiration of the Shanghai Mental Health Promotion Association, and also the lofty goal of the association.

The predecessor of the Shanghai Mental Health Promotion Association was the Shanghai Mental Health Committee; this committee was jointly organized by the following groups: the Joint Committee of Women's Groups, the Chinese Medical Association, the Shanghai Medical Association, the Chinese Psychological Association, the Shanghai International Education Association, and the Shanghai Social Work Club. It was established in Shanghai on June 17, 1938.

The Shanghai Mental Health Committee gradually fell into a state of stagnation due to the departure of the first chairman, Mr. Chen Heqin, from Shanghai. Therefore, socially ambitious people organized the Shanghai Mental Health Promotion Association, and at the same time, the Shanghai Mental Health Committee also decided to merge with this new group.

The establishment of the Shanghai Mental Health Promotion Association has received enthusiastic support from all sides. The purpose of the association is: (1) To educate the public about mental health through courses, radio broadcasts, lectures, and publishing articles in magazines, newspapers, and other publications; (2) To educate parents, guardians, and teachers in order to improve the mental health of children; to establish children's psychological guidance centers and other specialized institutions to care for and treat problem children and mentally retarded children; (3) To pay attention to the mental health of discharged mental patients, and to use mental illness treatment social work and mental illness clinics to treat patients with mild neuroses, neuroses, addiction, alcoholism, and anti-social behavior; (4) To improve the current state of care for neurotic and insane patients in hospitals; (5) To lead mental illness treatment social work in hospitals; (6) To create, lead, or support any other plans or methods to improve the psychological state in daily life.

In terms of work planning, it is divided into two major parts: in terms of symptomatic treatment, it is to do social work for mental illness; in terms of fundamental treatment, it is to do the work of preventing mental illness.

This group of socially serving volunteers is now silently burying themselves in their work; they have launched a mental health movement with a pious and earnest attitude.

In terms of symptomatic treatment, what they have contributed is: they have jointly established a neuro-system disease treatment center with the World Red Swastika Society, using new and rational therapies to help insane mental patients recover to normal. They are also preparing to establish special schools for mentally retarded children and problem children to help society and parents to solve the problems of this group of children who cannot adapt to the environment, so that they can regain their due position in society.

In terms of fundamental treatment, what they have contributed is: they have established a children's psychological guidance center. Human character is formed in childhood. By providing appropriate education and guidance to children, they can correct and prevent abnormalities in adulthood. The Children's Psychological Guidance Center not only serves children with behavioral disorders, criminal tendencies, psychological abnormalities, and mental retardation; it also actively educates and guides parents, guardians, and school teachers to protect the mental health of children and prevent children from tending towards abnormal tendencies.

The Children's Psychological Guidance Center was formerly located in Tongren Hospital on Jiujiang Road; it is now located in the Red Swastika Society at No. 1171 Yuyuan Road. Whenever a problem child who needs a solution comes, they first undergo a physical examination by a doctor, then a psychologist tests the child's intelligence, and then a psychiatrist studies their mental state, while a social worker investigates their family environment. Finally, the doctor, psychologist, psychiatrist, and social worker jointly report the results obtained, work together to study the root causes of the child's psychological illness, and then determine an appropriate treatment plan.

At the same time, they are also preparing to publish a journal, contributing knowledge in the field of mental health to the public; so that this science, which helps mankind increase the efficiency and happiness of life, is universally popularized to every corner of society.

This urgent science, due to the cultivation and infusion of the Shanghai Mental Health Promotion Association, is transplanted to China to breed and bloom into brilliant flowers. The members of this promotion association include medical, psychological, educational psychological, educational, social work, religious, nursing and other specialized talents; and ordinary social people and enthusiastic charity workers who are interested in mental health.

### Bloodshed at the Da Zhonghua Hotel: Hou Yanli Shot and Killed: The Murderer Went Straight to the Room on the Sixth Floor to Commit the Crime: A Total of Five or Six Shots Were Fired and All Escaped Afterwards: Fan Fayuan and Xu Zhenhua Were Also Injured

At about 9:00 PM last night, a shooting occurred on the sixth floor of the Da Zhonghua Hotel on Yu Qiaqing Road. The victim was Hou Yanli, a major shareholder of the Qiuyuan gambling den in Huxi and the owner of Haili Real Estate Company on Jiangxi Road, who was over forty years old. He was shot in the chest and hand on the spot and died soon after. Xu Zhenhua was also injured in the head and abdomen by stray bullets, and Fan Fayuan was injured in the neck. The three perpetrators fired a total of five or six shots and all escaped without a trace. Later, a suspect was detained. The details of the incident are recorded as follows:

Private Room at the Hotel

Hou Yanli, a native of Songjiang, was over forty years old, wealthy, and a major shareholder of the Qiuyuan gambling den in Huxi. He also opened Haili Real Estate Company at No. 327 Hamilton Building on Jiangxi Road, hiring Xu Zhenhua (resident of No. 20 Sanle Village, Jisi Feier Road), a native of Suzhou, as the manager. Because of the large capital, the business was booming, making it one of the leading real estate companies. On the 26th of the previous month (May), Hou opened a private room at No. 628 on the sixth floor of the Da Zhonghua Hotel on Yu Qiaqing Road for convenience, with a daily room rate of 17 yuan and 6 jiao. It has only been about two months. Usually, there are few visitors, only Xu Zhenhua and a few others.

Friends Chatting Fan Fayuan, a native of Haimen, is 53 years old. During Zhang Zongchang's era, he was once the director of the Dezhou Arsenal. After leaving office, he lived in Shanghai. Later, he opened Jin'er Company at a certain number on Guling Road, which is now changed to China Tonic Company. He is a close friend of Hou, so he visits frequently. At about 9:00 PM last night, Fan, wearing a gray suit, was chatting with Hou and Xu Zhenhua in the room,

Sudden Attack Unexpectedly, three perpetrators, all dressed in short clothes, broke into the room. Without asking why, they saw Hou leaning on the sofa and immediately pulled out their pistols and shot at him. One shot hit his left chest on the spot, and another shot hit his left hand. Blood gushed out. Xu Zhenhua was also shot in the head and abdomen. After being injured, Xu fell to the floor at the door. Stray bullets also injured Fan's neck, fortunately the injuries were minor.

Three People Shot Seeing that the goal had been achieved, the perpetrators fled with their weapons without a trace. After the bellboy rushed to check, he saw that Yan was already in a coma, barely breathing, and his body was lying beside the sofa. Xu Zhenhua, a big fat man, was lying across the door, covered in blood, which was unbearable to watch. He immediately reported to the Lao Zha Police Station, ordering Chinese and Western detectives to rush to the scene with weapons. However, the murderer had disappeared like a yellow crane, and only one suspect was arrested. He is now detained in the police station for strict investigation.

One Dead, One in Critical Condition An ambulance was called to take the three injured people to Renji and Tongren Hospitals for treatment. However, Hou died shortly after arriving at the hospital because the injury was in a vital area. It is said that Xu's injury is serious and his life is also in danger. Fan suffered a scratch on his neck and left after being bandaged by the doctor. After the investigation of this case, one said it was a vendetta, and another said it was related to politics.

### Coolidge Sails from Shanghai: Carrying More Than 400 Passengers: Adams to Dock This Afternoon

The President Coolidge, a regular mail ship of the American President Lines, arrived in Shanghai on the morning of the 15th from Manila, Hong Kong, carrying American women and children evacuated from Hong Kong.

### Yang Jinrui, Owner of Jintai Fashion Company, Kidnapped Yesterday: Bandits Posed as Customers and Suddenly Used Violence: Family Received Strange Phone Calls After the Incident

The Jintai Fashion Company at No. 301 Tongfu Road in the Public Concession specializes in selling various fashion clothes and hats. The owner is Yang Jinrui, a native of Chuansha, who is 43 years old and has three sons and three daughters. His wife, Ms. Huang, is 40 years old and has a 65-year-old mother. The family of nine lives a well-off life due to the good business. At about 11:50 AM yesterday, Yang, who was lame and could not walk well, was sitting on a chair in the shop. Unexpectedly,

three bandits, all dressed in white silk shirts and trousers, pretended to be customers, first looking at the fashion women's straw hats in the window, gesturing and talking, looking very realistic. Then, they slowly walked inside. When they reached Yang, one of them suddenly pulled out a pistol and pointed it at his chest. At this time, another bandit also took out a weapon to intimidate his second son, Xikun (16 years old), and forbade him from making a sound. One of the bandits who was unarmed helped the armed bandits to forcibly drag Yang Jinrui out of the door, and took him to a Tailai car at the door, turning north into Huangjiasha and speeding west. More than an hour after the incident, the company suddenly received a strange phone call, saying that Mr. Yang was very safe now, but do not report to the police, and do not publish the news to the newspapers, otherwise Mr. Yang's life would be in danger. Today, the 17th, there will be a letter, etc. After the incident, his eldest son, Xigeng (18 years old), reported to the police. Chinese and Western detectives rushed to the scene to investigate and inquire about the details of the bandits' clothing, and reported to the police station for verification.

### Young Girl Sold and Forced into Prostitution: Nine People Involved Arrested

Zhang Wangshi, a woman from Changshu, is 38 years old and lives at No. 5 Yuanheli, Qinglian Street, Nanshi. In 1934, she adopted a girl named Zhang Guiying, who is 13 years old this year. Recently, due to the difficult life, Zhang Wangshi sold the girl to Liu Wangshi, a prostitute (40 years old, from Nanjing, living at No. 173 Caishi Street) for 100 yuan as an adopted daughter. Unexpectedly, Liu Wangshi had bad intentions and ordered the girl to have her virginity taken by a guest surnamed Yang at the Dongfang Hotel at No. 413 Yu Qiaqing Road on the 12th of this month, earning 40 yuan. However, because the girl was too young, she could not bear the ravages, so she complained to Gu Nishi (24 years old, from Peidong, a private prostitute) who lived in the same house. Gu Nishi thought there was an opportunity to take advantage of, so she persuaded the girl, claiming to teach her how to dance. The next morning at about 6:00 AM, she secretly led the girl to Xu Changming (51 years old, from Shaoxing, a secret agent in the Zhejiang Security Office) at No. 3, Lane 100, Wenzhou Road. Xu then hid the girl at Cao Wushi (36 years old, from Wuxi) at No. 133 Gansu Road, intending to sell her into prostitution. Zhang Wangshi learned about the incident, and went to Liu Wangshi's house at 11:00 PM that night to negotiate, but failed to resolve the issue. She reported the situation to the French police. The police received the report and sent detective Shao Guanrong to investigate. After confirming the facts, they first arrested Gu Nishi, Liu Wangshi, Gu Simei (39 years old, from Wuhu), Zhu Xilin (34 years old, from Yangzhou), and Chen Zhong (29 years old, from Yongren) at No. 3 of the Yongxing Inn at No. 183 Caishi Street. Then, according to the confessions of Liu Wangshi and others, they arrested Xu Changming and Cao Wushi. After questioning, they learned that the victim was at Wu Chenshi (45 years old, from Suzhou) at No. 32, Lane 32, Hengmaoli, Mintini Yin Road, and Zhang Guiying was found. At the same time, they also saw another girl, Qian Chenghua (14 years old, from Changzhou), in the room, who was also sold by Wu Chenshi for 300 yuan. They were all taken to the police station together. Yesterday afternoon, they were sent to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special Court. After the police lawyer Gu Shouxi stated the case, they were sued for the crime of obstructing family. Because the police station had not completed the investigation, they requested an extension. After Judge Liao interrogated the ages of the defendants, he ordered the case to be adjourned for 30 days, and the defendants were detained.

He was then dispatched to the French Concession police department in Tianjin for many years before coming to Shanghai to serve as Assistant Police Commissioner of the French Concession for five years, eventually being promoted to Deputy Police Commissioner, serving a total of seventeen years.

Advice on Burial

Burial does not necessarily require auspicious feng shui; except for barren wastelands, all sites are essentially auspicious. Burial does not depend on beautiful tomb mountains; simply returning the soul to the earth is sufficient to comfort the departed spirit. Why, then, are there still those who delay burial? The wealthy are misled by geomancers, seeking the best location, believing that hasty burial is unfilial. The poor lack burial land and resources, inevitably resorting to temporary placement, delaying for years. Are they not longing for early burial? However, they lack deep understanding and are constrained by custom and financial difficulties, ultimately exposing the coffin and committing a sin, which is lamentable! People strive throughout their lives, seeking contentment. Parents are particularly concerned about their descendants. If descendants deeply understand their parents' hearts, they will seek to ensure a dignified funeral without regrets. How can one not feel remorse if a parent dies and is not buried? How can one not cause the parent remorse if burial is delayed? I have seen coffins left at home, infested with worms and mice, covered in dust and rain for years. The longer the delay, the more difficult and costly the burial becomes. Initially, they spare no expense to purchase land, seeking renowned geomancers, but soon, they are thwarted by geomancers, neighbors, and family disputes, and the delay persists. Initially, they raise funds for the funeral and to prepare the tomb, but soon, these funds are spent on weddings, and the delay persists. What are they thinking, allowing the parental spirit to never return to the earth?

### The Work of the Victorious Christ

Jesus Christ is the victorious Lord, and His work includes: (1) Saving us from the power of darkness—We all know that slaves have no freedom, like cattle and horses, driven by others. Those who do not believe in Jesus as Savior are slaves of sin, living under the power of darkness, unable to find joy and freedom in life. Look at ambitious young people who, with education, great hopes, and high aspirations, come to big cities, wanting to succeed and become upright individuals. Sadly, sin captures them, and they fall daily, living sinful lives, resulting in shame, failure, and death. Ah! Sin is truly terrifying, killing countless young people. Who can save them? Only Lord Jesus: "Jesus Christ came into the world to save sinners." "There is salvation in no one else." Those living in sin, quickly believe in Jesus, and He will save you from the power of sin.

(2) Guiding us into the glory of God—Believing in Jesus not only forgives sins but also allows us to share in God's glory. Humans were originally glorious, but sin erased this glory. Now, Jesus died on the cross, taking away our sins, so we can once again share in God's glory. Don't you see how many young people who were once ashamed, failed, fallen, and near death change once they believe in Jesus? Shame turns to glory, failure to success, death to salvation. Do you think your life is glorious? If not, why not trust in Jesus? He will guide you into the glory of God.

(3) Giving us eternal life—Life is very short. After decades, we will die. Eternal life or eternal death depends on our choice. Believing in Lord Jesus gives us eternal life. The Bible says: "That everyone who believes in Him may not perish but have eternal life." "The one who does not believe is condemned already." Young people! You have only one lifetime, how short! Only one life, how precious! May you make a wise and prudent choice today!

### Industry Discussion

— Miaomang

Industry Discussion

Everyone will not forget the skyrocketing coal briquette prices two months ago, right? The highest price for a load of coal briquettes reached eight yuan, and the situation was so dire that it seemed like it could break ten yuan. This was a threat to the general middle and lower classes to the point of being unbearable. Attacks and calls for action filled the newspapers almost daily, but nothing was effective. Everyone passed the responsibility, citing only high "shipping costs" and "exchange rates."

This dragged on until yesterday (the 15th), when the following news, revealing a glimmer of hope, was discovered: "Coal Market Situation: Recently, due to competition among businesses, the black market is unusually chaotic. The industry association, recognizing that this cannot continue, held a meeting and decided that from today, standardized factory prices will be implemented..."

The standardized price is seven yuan and five jiao per load (about the same as the current market price). In other words, no business is allowed to sell below this price. Furthermore, this estimated price is at least a certain amount above the cost. Otherwise, those competing businesses would not have "black market" prices beyond their cost and deserved profit and suffer losses.

This industry discussion clearly aims to maintain the profits of the industry, based on the principle of seeking profit from capital. We do not oppose this. However, from this industry discussion, we hope that industry associations (not just the coal briquette industry) will only stand up and speak out when their interests are in conflict. In addition to maintaining profits, they should also consider the "livelihoods of the masses!" If, during the skyrocketing prices, the industry association had also issued a resolution stating, "This cannot continue," what would the sentiments of the common people have been?

### Summer Homework Varieties: A Letter from the Class Teacher to the Children

— Ruohong

Children: Although I have only spent a year with you, during this year, I have found so much comfort in your innocent conversations and joyful work! I truly wish to be around you always, living together, but today, school is out for summer vacation, and we will have a temporary separation. During this separation, I have my own work to do, and I still need to read. How are you planning to spend this long vacation? I believe that you clever and hardworking children must have already made a good summer vacation plan, right? But I am your class teacher, and I am very willing to guide you. Below are some things you can do during the vacation that I have written down at random. Please compare them with your own plans to see if there are any similarities.

1. Keep a diary without interruption, and record your life during the vacation truthfully.
2. Continue practicing calligraphy, both large and small characters, according to our usual requirements.
3. Write four compositions, following the composition topics of the summer homework competition organized by Shen Bao.
4. Arithmetic: Review old exercises, especially practice addition with the abacus.
5. Read extracurricular books and newspapers.
6. Visit relatives and friends, and ask your parents to take you or go yourself to practice etiquette.
7. Contact other children to organize a summer club or join a reliable children's vacation organization.
8. Learn to sing new national songs that should be sung and meaningful children's songs.
9. Learn at least one new game (such as chess, jump rope, etc.).
10. Communicate with teachers and classmates.
11. Take cold water baths and practice washing clothes.
12. Others.

Some of the above tasks must be done, while others can be more flexible and do not have to be followed exactly. If you think it is not enough, then you can freely add to it. In short, please remember: Summer vacation is a good opportunity for us to do homework automatically. Summer homework should not "seek quantity" but "do more." Finished. I hope that at the beginning of the next semester, I can see your rich homework report. I wish you well.

Your class teacher ×××

This is just a simple letter, and the summer homework mentioned in it is also just a few simple items. But I love this letter very much because I feel that it is full of a teacher's kind and amiable words, and many sentences could not have been written by someone who had not really mixed with children. As for the homework items listed, although they are simple and broad, a closer look reveals that they are not like the perfunctory assignment of homework by ordinary teachers, but that they pay attention to all aspects. We should pay tribute to such teachers and wish them to continue to do their best in the children's team: sowing, fertilizing, irrigating, weeding, and pest control... His spirit will never be wasted. I hope this letter can be published for other children to refer to; and also for other teachers to refer to.

### Family Letter

— Ji

My maternal uncle's driver came again today, as usual, asking me to write a family letter for him and fill out a money order from the post office for five yuan, which is this month's household expenses. The following is what I wrote after listening to his mechanical string of words.

××, if you see this: I received your letter the other day and learned that Longxiang'er is in good health, and you are also well. I also learned that Uncle Lingen came to my house in the middle of the month. Regarding his money, I have been thinking about it every day. Recently, prices in Shanghai have become more expensive again. Socks are almost a yuan a pair, and my shoes are worn out again. I save everywhere, but still do not have an extra penny. You say the household expenses are not enough, and the rice price is as expensive as in Shanghai. Although there is some land, I also know that it is not enough to support the family. However, for now, we can only endure it. Recently, I heard the master say that the vehicle tax will be increased by 40%, and there are not many house calls (my maternal uncle is a doctor), so I am afraid the car will also not be used. I have not been smoking cigarettes lately, and there is not much extra money. This month, I can only send five yuan. I will try to send a little more next month. Talk to Uncle Lingen again and ask him to wait a few more days. I will try to send it together next month after I find a way. Please make two pairs of shoes for me and bring them out when someone is available. Write a letter back when you receive the money. Your husband, ××, above

After writing it, I read it to him. I sealed it and put on the stamp for him. He put it in the mailbox. He hopes that in the distant hometown, this mechanical family letter will be received soon—a family letter under the pressure of high living costs!

Hawthorne Detective Case

### The Destiny After the Dance

— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter 3: Conflicting Information

At this time, Hawthorne suddenly made an unexpected move. He suddenly stood up, strode to the door of the living room, and quickly looked out. It turned out that his ears were performing two tasks simultaneously, listening to Old Mao's moving report on one hand and paying attention to the sounds outside the door, clearly guarding against someone eavesdropping. He lingered at the door for a moment, as if he wanted to run upstairs. He hesitated slightly, then stopped, slowly returned, closed the door of the parlor, and sat down again.

Hawthorne continued to ask, "What did Miss Wang say at the time?"

Old Mao said, "Her voice was very low, I couldn't hear it. But I believe she definitely wouldn't get angry. Because I heard her chuckling several times. Hmph, Miss Wang's laughter is really powerful! Because of her laughter again and again, she transformed Manager Lu's towering anger into a peaceful atmosphere. In less than half an hour, Manager Lu, when he left, the seven evil spirits had turned into Amitabha Buddha!"

Hawthorne lowered his head again and became still. Hearing this, I felt that the case was indeed complicated. As it unfolded step by step, its intricate and confusing content became clearer. Since the protagonist of this case is a famous red dance star, it is naturally inevitable that there will be a connection to eroticism. As far as the facts we know so far are concerned, there are already three male characters, and these three have mutual relationships. For example, Yu Gantang had a conflict with Zhao Boxiong; Zhao Boxiong had an indirect connection with Lu Jiansheng; and the main cause of the disputes among the three was focused on this charming dance queen. It would indeed take some brainpower to sort this out clearly. This kind of speculation was originally just an opportunity at the time, but this opportunity was already being used by Ni Jinshou.

He said to Old Mao, "According to what you said, this guy named Zhao has a very close friendship with your master, so he is unlikely to have killed your master."

Old Mao nodded and said, "Yes, I also don't think so—but—" He suddenly stopped.

Hawthorne suddenly raised his head. "What? There's another 'but'?"

Old Mao seemed a little hesitant. "He—he also seemed unhappy once."

"What was it for?"

"That was on the afternoon of the 17th, the day before yesterday. Miss Wang was talking to the young master in this living room—"

"What? The young master?"

Entertainment World

### Appetite-Stimulating Movies

— Xinfang

Movies can be listed as tools of war and can also help stimulate appetite! Readers will probably be surprised to hear this. Now I'm going to tell you all that the appetite-stimulating movie is originally called "Film Appetizer" and was recently invented by a Japanese man named Mionma who has joined the American nationality. The initial motivation for the invention was due to the successful experiments with flavored movies.

Not long ago, he conducted an experiment at a clinic in San Francisco. At that time, he screened an appetite-stimulating movie. The audience was all patients. What was shown on the screen was the situation of eating roast meat, beef, fish, and various fruits, sweets, etc. At the same time, the taste of all these things was released using the principle of flavored movies when the film was screened. As a result, the appetite of the sick audience who watched the film was restored or greatly increased.

This kind of film will inevitably be adopted by general restaurants in the future, and diners who watch this kind of film will pay a higher price than the food they want to eat!

### Diana Durbin's Transformation History

— Qinghui

Will Diana Durbin and Vongh Paul get married? This is a question that many movie fans are eager to know. But love is mysterious and incomprehensible, and even Durbin herself is probably not sure. So I will leave this aside and only talk about the process of their love:

About the summer of last year, Durbin noticed a tall and handsome young man at a friend's banquet, and that was Vongh Paul. After being introduced by a friend, the two had a conversation once, and both had a good impression of each other, and Durbin was already in love at first sight. Of course, the girl was shy. Although she had fallen in love with Vongh Paul, she never expressed it, so at that time, the outside world knew very little about their love news.

It was not until August of last year that, unexpectedly, Durbin suddenly received a call from Vongh Paul, asking her if she was free to have dinner with him. In a hurry, she agreed to the first evening's meeting. This time, the two talked very speculatively and were reluctant to part until late at night, so their love slowly reached a mature stage. After that, they often met, danced, had dinner, swam, drove, watched movies... As if they were leaving, they both felt very lonely. When they were together, they had unspeakable joy. Because of this, American newspapers and magazines carried news of their love affair every day, causing a storm, and it has not subsided yet.

As for her lover, Vongh Paul, I will mention him in passing here: He is the assistant director of Universal Pictures, 26 years old this year, a sincere and upright young man with a gentle personality and abundant knowledge, and his appearance is tall and handsome. It is no wonder that Durbin is in love with him. Not only that, but her whole family likes him. Is this an accident?

The movie production rights of "Li Xiangjun," which is currently being performed by Zhonglv, have been purchased by the newly established Golden Star Company. A reporter received news that another company also intends to make this film. According to the Union's advance notice, "Li Xiangjun" was listed as one of the new films, but the Union had no news of making this film. The reporter asked people in the film industry again, and it was said that "If there is such a thing, it is not the Union that is doing it."

### Important Changes in the Chinese Film Industry

——Xinhua and Yi Hua Decide to Cooperate

After several consultations between the highest authorities of China United Film Company (Xinhua, Hua Xin, and Hua Cheng) and Yi Hua Company, it has been decided to cooperate. All detailed measures are still being worked out, but the principles have been approved. With the consent of relevant parties, the reporter hereby reports this significant change in the film industry to readers.

The brewing of cooperation between the two companies dates back to early spring. At that time, the reporter inquired with Mr. Zhang Shankun, General Manager of United Company, but Mr. Zhang did not acknowledge it, saying that it was far from mature and asked not to publish it. Subsequently, due to various reasons, the negotiations suddenly stalled. After the "Three Smiles" incident, the relationship between United and Yi Hua suddenly became harmonious. Therefore, the old matter was brought up again, and both parties felt the necessity of close cooperation, which proceeded smoothly. In the short term, we will see a large number of Xinhua male and female actors starting work on the Yi Hua studio. It is also reported that all Yi Hua technical personnel will retain their positions, while directors and actors will be selected separately with the consent of both parties.

This cooperation is similar to that of 20th Century and Fox in Hollywood, and in the past, there were Great China, Republic of China, and Shanghai companies in the country. It is greatly beneficial both internally and externally.

### Special Performance by the Music Friends Society

This Sunday (the 21st), the American Naval Chapel of the Great Light will hold a solemn ceremony to bid farewell to the Reverend Morgan, who is returning to the United States. The Music Friends Society Choir, led by the renowned Professor Zhao Meibo, has been specially invited to perform a special program. The members of the Music Friends Society are all disciples of Professor Zhao and are among the best musicians in Shanghai. This spring, the group's technical expression has been outstanding, and they are all extraordinary. The last time the group's female voices performed at the Great Light, it caused a sensation on the sea, with thousands of people unable to get a seat. Now that they reappear, it is extraordinary. It is also heard that the group has accepted the invitation of Mr. Meibo, the conductor of the Municipal Council Orchestra, and will perform in Zhaofeng Garden.

### "Havoc in Heaven"

— Lu Yi

Carlton to be Screened Tomorrow

It's been a while since we've seen a thrilling science fiction film. This is indeed a thrilling film that integrates many aspects of scientific ideals. It is a sequel to "Flash Gordon" by Universal Company, originally named Rocket Ship, now translated as "Havoc in Heaven," which is quite consistent with the content.

The entire film is about a sudden disaster on Earth, believed to be related to other planets. Scientists Chai Kofu and Falunxu, etc., chase after the cause, until the extraterrestrial demon named "Ming" is eliminated to ensure the safety of the Earth. Every minute is full of tension. The film has mythical scenes such as fire escape and earth escape, but also fantasies of future scientific inventions such as radio light guns and cannons. Compared with the science fiction films previously shown in Shanghai, "Havoc in Heaven" is no less than any other, and is indeed a film worth watching. This film is scheduled to premiere at the Carlton Theatre starting tomorrow (the 18th). At the same time, the theater has also negotiated with Universal to reduce ticket prices, which is very convenient for the general audience.
