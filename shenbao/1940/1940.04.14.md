Editorial

### Promoting the Implementation of Constitutional Government

At the closing of the fifth session of the National Political Council on the tenth of this month, President Chiang, in his closing address as chairman, summarized the efforts of this session, focusing on three matters: first, the condemnation of the Japanese puppets; second, economic development; and third, the implementation of constitutional government. Military, economic, and political affairs are essential to the survival of a modern nation in the international arena and should not be neglected or prioritized over one another. China, in the midst of the War of Resistance, should strive to achieve excellence in all three areas simultaneously. However, based on a careful analysis of the situation, the achievements are not balanced: the condemnation of the Japanese puppets has a clear plan and a grasp of the certainty of victory; economic development is just beginning to sprout; and the implementation of constitutional government is still in the preparatory stage, merely "expected to be achieved." This is simply because the foundations are not initially uniform, and the best adaptation to the environment cannot be without a sense of urgency and priority. What is meant by urgency and priority? The hungry urgently need food, clothing comes second; the cold urgently need clothing, food comes second. This is not to say that warmth and sustenance are not important to life, but that there are priorities. China in the midst of the War of Resistance: "National Supremacy, Ethnic Supremacy, Military First, Victory First, Concentrated Will, Concentrated Strength." This is the absolute principle, the absolute belief, and the whole country has no different opinion. It is not only true for today's China, but also for all countries and peoples throughout history during times of war against foreign enemies, who must rely on this principle and belief to achieve victory. Economic development is one of the elements of concentrated strength, and the implementation of constitutional government is one of the elements of concentrated will. All factors are combined to achieve military victory. But what is most urgent is the military, so although all three matters should be given equal importance, the general public is most concerned about military affairs. Such passion and such hope are constantly and reliably evident. Second to military affairs is the economy, because the destruction of major industrial and commercial centers in the past three years of the War of Resistance is most noticeable, and the rising prices and difficult living conditions are deeply felt by all levels of society. Furthermore, the vast military needs and the heavy burden on the national treasury, and the fact that military achievements are always related to financial resources, are all within the scope of common knowledge. It is therefore appropriate for the general public to pay attention to the economy and strive to develop it. Upon careful observation of public opinion, it is clear that the concern for politics is far less than that for military and economic affairs.

Humans are political animals. The quality of politics in a modern nation is directly proportional to the level of political interest among its people. Based on this principle, it is necessary to universally arouse the general public's attention to politics in China. Moreover, the turbulent and painful revolutionary process of the past thirty years, what was the purpose? Its ultimate goal is to achieve constitutional government. The Kuomintang, in launching the revolution, holding political power, promoting tutelage, and leading the War of Resistance, is still diligently working towards the implementation of constitutional government. Constitutional government is governance in accordance with the law. The future implementation of constitutional government will transform from party rule to popular rule, from participation to governance. The Kuomintang is the one implementing it, and the people are the ones receiving it. Therefore, if the people do not pay the utmost concern and attention to politics now, they will fail to live up to constitutional government. Do the people not say that they are not ignoring politics, but only that military affairs are first and victory is first, so they inevitably view politics as something that can be put off? That they are not belittling constitutional government, but only that they trust President Chiang, and wish to relieve the nation from its predicament and complete the great task of national construction under his leadership? Such sentiments are the shared understanding and reason among the general public, and are a major factor in their willingness to endure sacrifices and firmly believe in victory. However, based on the spirit of constitutional government and the essence of democracy, there is something unsettling. There are also those who believe that under constitutional government, there will be a multitude of opinions and disputes, and it is likely to violate the original intention of concentrating will and strength, and only serve as a hotbed for party strife. It is better to leave things as they are and wait for the future. Such concerns, mindful of historical lessons, cannot be dismissed as mere杞人憂天; however, things may or may not happen, and the principle is not inevitable. To address the general psychology and seek to guide it according to the circumstances, it is important to recognize President Chiang's loyalty to the country, the Kuomintang's sincerity in implementing constitutional government, and to analyze the arduousness of the nation's resistance and construction, and to encourage the people to share loyalty and bear the burden together. As for the disputes under constitutional government, they are sufficient to express one aspect of the value of constitutional government. Indeed, the distinction between agreement and disagreement is the source of progress. With the spirit of the rule of law, and following the framework of the grand code, disputes are not to be feared. Consider, why is there such a thing as flexibility in the constitution? The key is to have room for maneuver within the law, while still maintaining the integrity of the principles. Consider, why must there be provisions for amending the constitution or any law? The key is to show that the terms are not immutable and can be adapted to the times. Modifications that do not comply with legal procedures are illegal in ordinary law and destructive to the law in the constitution, and are certainly not tolerated by normal constitutional government. In other words, the constitution does allow for legal amendments, and people with the spirit of the rule of law have a framework to follow. Who would be so impatient as to dare to destroy the law? Consider, why are the terms of people's representatives limited? Why are there re-elections at the end of the term? The key is that personnel are not permanent and should be replaced over time. Regular re-elections are the way to prevent illegal and untimely competition. How do the unworthy retire and the virtuous advance? Each has its legal methods and opportunities. Thus, if the people do not have the spirit of the rule of law, then constitutional government is fundamentally impossible to discuss. If the people strictly maintain the spirit of the rule of law, then even if there are disputes under the constitution, they will not be a threat to the country. Moreover, in times of war, those who oppose this nation and conspire to sabotage it take many forms. Who among the people is not loyal and would give others an opportunity to exploit? Who would not work together in harmony and instead disperse the will and strength? It is said that we should endure for the sake of the country, and also that we should understand and help each other. With this attitude, and with the rule of law to bind and encourage each other, then arousing the people to pay the utmost concern and attention to politics in order to promote the implementation of constitutional government will not only not be a threat to national affairs, but the will and strength will not only be concentrated, but also strengthened. This is inevitable.

### German Troops Concentrate on the Hungarian-Southern Border; Netherlands Breaches Dikes to Strengthen Defenses; Balkan Countries to Hold Conference to Discuss Preventing War from Spreading to Southeastern Europe; French Observers Pay Attention to Italian Movements

Amsterdam, This afternoon between 3:30 and 4:00 PM, the 85 sirens installed in this city sounded in unison for testing purposes, to warn citizens in case of a German invasion. Last night, soldiers with fixed bayonets and machine guns patrolled the entrances of important buildings in the center of The Hague throughout the night. Newspapers warned the public not to panic. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)

The Hague, German troops today concentrated in areas of Austria Province near the borders of Hungary and Yugoslavia. For example, large numbers of troops arrived in the cities of Bruck an der Mur, Graz, and Villach in Carinthia. All hotels and public places have been provided for the use of the troops. (Havas dispatch, 12th)

The Hague, The Dutch military authorities are aware of German troop movements near the Dutch border. They have concentrated large forces in the provinces of Limburg and Brabant, and have breached dikes to flood certain areas in the province of Utrecht for defensive purposes. In addition, local police authorities have been monitoring members of the Dutch National Socialist Party. However, four National Socialist members of parliament have already gone into hiding. This morning, someone was arrested for taking photographs in a certain important area. Also, a German carrying homing pigeons was expelled from the country by the authorities on suspicion of espionage. (Havas dispatch, 12th)

Paris, Diplomatic circles here recently commented that the naval battle between the British and French fleets and the German fleet in the North Sea and off the coast of Norway, as well as the land battles in the Scandinavian Peninsula, are only a prelude to a larger European war. British First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill also stated this in his speech to the House of Commons. However, Germany has recently spread rumors that Britain and France are about to violate Belgium's neutrality, intending to use this as a pretext for attacking Belgium. It is reported that German troops have concentrated near the Dutch border, and the British and French military authorities have cancelled all leave for officers and soldiers to prepare for any eventuality. In southeastern Europe, Germany is also making preparations, causing anxiety among the countries of southeastern Europe. Although the authorities of Yugoslavia, Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria have all denied that Germany has made demands on them, no one can deny the active activities of German diplomatic authorities in the Danube River region. Generally, the German side believes that with the outbreak of war in Northern Europe, German diplomacy in Southeastern Europe has a good chance of succeeding. Observers are paying close attention to the movements of Italy, as Italy is the only country in Europe that supports Germany's actions. In addition, rumors that Britain and France will lay mines in the Adriatic Sea and prepare to send troops to land in Albania are all fabrications of German propaganda. Since the meeting between the leaders of Germany and Italy at the Brenner Pass, Germany has been trying to win over Italy to confront Britain and France. (Havas dispatch, 12th)

Rome, According to information received here indirectly, the Balkan countries will hold a conference in the near future to discuss various plans to prevent the spread of war to southeastern Europe. The first item on the agenda is the issue of safeguarding the safety of navigation on the Danube River. It is said that Hungarian Prime Minister Pál Teleki may meet with Yugoslav Prime Minister Dragiša Cvetković. (Haitong dispatch, 13th)

Budapest, Rumors in Rome that Hungarian Prime Minister Teleki plans to visit Yugoslavia on May 1st have been denied by responsible sources here, who stated briefly that the Hungarian Prime Minister will not be leaving the country for the time being. (Haitong dispatch, 13th)

### U.S. Decides on Strategy to Prevent Japanese Invasion of the Dutch East Indies; Secretary of the Navy Personally Inspects Fleet Exercises; U.S. Naval Bases to Be Strengthened

Washington, Naval experts here told reporters that if Germany invades the Netherlands and Belgium, the United States may have to use Hawaii as the base for most or all of its navy to coerce Japan from invading the Dutch East Indies. They also said that if chaotic fighting breaks out in the Netherlands and Belgium, Japan may send its fleet to the East Indies under the pretext of maintaining order and liberating the natives from European rule. The US Navy has already considered this possibility. It is generally believed here that the US Navy General Staff has long planned an appropriate strategy to prevent the Japanese Navy from advancing southward, because if the East Indies are conquered by Japan, the sources of tin and rubber for the United States will fall into Japanese hands, and Japan will no longer need to rely on the United States for oil. This situation is well understood here. According to information disclosed by Navy Department personnel, President Roosevelt has personally instructed Secretary of the Navy Charles Edison to go to the Pacific to inspect the US fleet currently conducting large-scale exercises, so that Asian countries will deeply understand the importance the US government attaches to these exercises. It is generally believed that the original plan for the ships to return to San Diego on May 15 may change due to the development of the situation in Europe. However, Edison will definitely return to Washington no later than April 28. Furthermore, according to the analysis of official reports and reliable information by some government personnel, Germany's invasion of Norway was strategically unwise. Therefore, Germany may attack the Netherlands, Belgium, or Sweden to reverse its unfavorable position. At the same time, according to another report, traffic in the Skagerrak and Kattegat straits has been controlled by the Allied countries, and the German expeditionary force sent to Norway has been cut off from contact with its homeland. (Special dispatch from Fritzmaurice, International News Service, 13th)

Washington, Secretary of the Navy Edison told reporters in Honolulu that, based on his observations, the naval base in the Hawaiian Islands is currently insufficient to meet military needs. Therefore, the Navy Department plans to strengthen the naval bases in Hawaii, Alaska, and Puerto Rico. (Haitong dispatch, 13th)

### U.S. to Convene Another Naval Conference; Request Congress to Appropriate Funds for Shipbuilding to Accelerate Fleet Expansion

Washington, Chairman of the Senate Naval Affairs Committee Walsh stated yesterday that the government is considering requesting Congress to appropriate funds to accelerate the expansion of the US fleet due to the extension of the European war to Scandinavia. Walsh's statement was issued after President Roosevelt convened a naval conference. Those attending the naval conference included Chairman of the House Naval Affairs Committee Vinson and Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Stark. Walsh claimed that the naval conference will reconvene soon to consider requesting Congress to appropriate funds to build new ships to supplement the fleet's deficiencies.

### Soviet Union Exposes Japan's Ambitions Towards the U.S.; Preparing Military Arrangements Under the Guise of Land Concessions

Moscow, Foreign Minister Molotov stated in a speech to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union on the 19th of last month that, in his view, relations between the Soviet Union and Japan were unsatisfactory. Since then, Soviet radio stations have continuously broadcast anti-Japanese remarks, criticizing the establishment of the "Wang Jingwei regime" and Japan's expansion plans. Today, they exposed the "activities of Japanese imperialists in Latin America," stating: "The economic interests of the United States and Japan in Central and South America are increasingly in conflict. Japanese immigrants are continuously emigrating to Brazil, Peru, Mexico, and the countries of Central America, and the number of concessions they own in these countries is also increasing. This is one reason. Commercial relations between Japan and Mexico have recently greatly improved, and an export credit bank has been established in the port of São Paulo, Mexico, whose main business is the export of cotton and coffee to Japan. This is the second reason. Furthermore, Japan's facilities in Latin America have other goals besides trade. In other words, Japan is preparing to extend its control to the frozen Pacific Ocean. For example, the locations of the concessions it holds near the Panama Canal are of great strategic value. Those it holds within the borders of Brazil can be used as submarine bases at any time, and those it holds in Mexico, Colombia, and Costa Rica can easily be converted into air bases. Japanese aircraft can easily fly to the Panama Canal from these bases in a few hours. This canal is the Gibraltar of Latin America." (Havas dispatch, 12th)

### U.S. Reciprocal Trade Agreement Extension Bill Signed by Roosevelt

Washington, President Roosevelt has now signed the bill extending the reciprocal trade agreement program for three years. The US President described this program as a powerful tool for increasing the well-being of the United States and strengthening the foundations of lasting peace. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)

Washington, President Roosevelt told the press yesterday that the three-year extension of the reciprocal trade agreement program represents the decision of the American people to maintain this powerful tool for another three years to improve the national economy and consolidate the foundations of peace.

The newspapers here all stated that this conference was broad in scope and of great significance. (Havas dispatch, 11th)

### Production of Major Japanese Textiles Decreases

Tokyo, According to statistics from the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, the production of major textiles such as wool, hemp, silk, and rayon in Japan in January this year was lower than in December last year, except for cotton prices. Although the decrease in production was partly due to seasonal factors, most types of production were also lower than in January last year, even when calculated at inflated prices. The production value of woolen textiles in January this year was 25,750,000 yen, a decrease of 4,930,000 yen from December last year and a decrease of 576,000 yen from January last year. The production value of major fiber materials was 13,824,000 yen, a decrease of 4,802,000 yen from December last year and a decrease of 11,669,000 yen from January last year. The production value of hemp textiles was 1,635,000 yen, a decrease of 374,000 yen from December last year but an increase of 343,000 yen from January last year. The production value of silk textiles was 64,884,000 yen, a decrease of 14,166,000 yen from December last year but an increase of 24,038,000 yen from January last year, or 58 percent, because silk prices were higher in January this year than in the same month last year. The production value of rayon was 24,270,000 yen, a decrease of 6,635,000 yen from January last year.

### British Air Force Shows Power in North Sea; Norwegian Army Fights Bravely in Coordination; Terrain North of Oslo Favors Guerrilla Warfare; Southern Coastal Ports Controlled by German Troops

London, According to a naval communique, naval battles are still underway off the coast of Norway. Yesterday, the air force of the British fleet attacked enemy warships, transport ships, and supply ships in the port of Bergen, dropping bombs on three large transport ships, destroying a warehouse storing military supplies, and strafing a torpedo boat with machine guns. The weather was extremely bad, and one British aircraft was forced to land on the sea near an island. It was seen that two crew members had left the aircraft, and the remaining aircraft returned safely to base. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)

London, Swedish radio last night broadcast a communique from the Norwegian military headquarters, summarizing the Norwegian war situation as follows: German troops have occupied Oslo and its vicinity. Norwegian troops are currently holding the line north and northeast of Oslo. German troops have controlled Kristiansand, Stavanger, Bergen, Trondheim, and two other locations on the southern coast of Norway, and have occupied Narvik. However, the entire northern region is under the control of Norwegian troops. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)

Helsinki, Finnish radio stations have recently broadcast news that fighting is still ongoing near Elverum, Norway, but most of it is guerrilla warfare. Although the Norwegian troops are small in number, they are equipped with modern machine guns and are familiar with the terrain, inflicting damage on the German troops. The Norwegian authorities are implementing mobilization measures in the Ostrondet area and are constructing defensive lines between Jösen and Etterstad. Civilian men and women are actively participating in the work. (Havas dispatch, 12th)

Stockholm, A Norwegian communique issued here states that there has been fighting at the Foss and Lange bridges north of Oslo. The bridges over the Glomma and Vorma rivers in front of the Norwegian positions have been mined. Telephone and telegraph lines to Germany have been cut. Oslo's power supply has been disrupted due to the opening of the floodgates. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)

Stockholm, According to information received here, there was a naval and air battle outside Oslo last night. The British side concentrated ten warships, apparently intending to attack the German troops in Trondheim. Germany launched a large-scale air raid on Elverum. Norway is currently conducting a strong guerrilla war against the German troops, especially in the east. The information here is disclosed by newspapers or radio broadcasts but has not been officially confirmed. They indicate that the Allied naval and air forces are actively advancing in the Skagerrak Strait and along the western coast of Norway. A telephone call from Strömstad, northwest coast of Sweden, stated that a major naval and air battle clearly took place outside Oslo. It is speculated that British forces forcibly landed amidst the artillery fire set up by the Germans on the Norwegian coast. The "Aftonbladet" reported that British forces have concentrated naval and air power in Halden and are preparing to attack. The area is close to South Moss and twelve miles north of Trondheim. Norway's land defense line in the fortress has gradually strengthened so that it can cooperate with the British attack. The newspaper also reported that the Norwegian position in Elverum has been completely destroyed by the German air force. Also, a Swedish newspaper reported a message from the Swedish-Norwegian border stating that the Norwegian-German battle line has extended to the north and northeast of Oslo, but the battle situation is not detailed. In addition, a report from Kiel, Denmark, stated that there were no signs of naval battles in the Kattegat Strait this morning. Last night, United Press received private information from the Norwegian county of Konsvinger stating that German troops have recently advanced northward from Oslo to Konsvinger. The city has now been largely evacuated, and the city's volunteers have acquired weapons and food and are currently concentrating in the Skal area west of the city. Part of the volunteer army is resisting the German troops north of the city. (United Press dispatch, 13th)

London

A Reuters military correspondent reports that the new line around Oslo, Norway, is intermittent and can only be called a continuous series of outposts, starting from Lake Mjösa, more than fifty miles north of Oslo, and ending at Eidsvoll, and then extending to the town of Lillestrøm, near Oslo, which is currently still in German hands. The terrain near Oslo is very conducive to Norwegian resistance. There is only one small airfield there, which was created by blasting away thousands of tons of rock in the mountains. It is not suitable for landing large numbers of German bombers because it is too small. Apart from this, there are no other natural airfields near Oslo. German troops in Oslo, threatened by the British Navy's constant threat to their sea lanes, dare not go any deeper, as this would put their base at risk of immediate loss. Given the current situation, the German troops must be feeling uneasy. The destruction of a German 8,000-ton munitions ship and the sinking and damaging of dozens of ships in the port of Kattegat will cause a major setback for the German troops in Oslo. Although they can temporarily take everything from the Norwegians, such an invading force will immediately lose its power without military supplies. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)

Continuous Reinforcements of German Troops Arrive

Stockholm, "Nygitt" reports that although it is rumored that the Norwegians have stopped the German troops north of Oslo, fresh German troops suddenly attacked Halden at the southeast end. Part of these German troops advanced from Moss, and the other part belongs to newly arrived troops who landed in the Etevskirke area. It is reported that there has been fierce fighting in the Sarpsborg area. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)

Berlin, A semi-official source here last night issued a war report from Norway stating that German troops are continuing to reinforce several bases. The number of coastal batteries that have been set up and are ready for combat has now increased. German troops have occupied the Stor airfield and expanded the anti-aircraft positions. The supply of troops and military supplies continues to be transported without being hindered. The coastal artillery outside Trondheim has repelled several British ships attempting to advance. Six British destroyers have sunk off Narvik, and several other destroyers have been sunk by the German Navy and Air Force. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)

Oslo, German troops continued to arrive here yesterday. Heavy artillery, armored vehicles, and large quantities of military supplies have also arrived. German transport ships have also arrived in Trondheim, Kristiansand, and Bergen. According to reliable sources, German mechanized units have been advancing rapidly in central and northern Norway. Almost all of Norway's railways have been occupied by German troops. (Haitong dispatch, 13th)

Oslo, German troops advanced from Oslo into the interior, and have already crossed the Østerdalen to the northeast and the Drammen to the west. The Norwegian people are extraordinarily calm and do not show hostility towards the German troops. The German troops have not encountered strong resistance. (Haitong dispatch, 13th)

Germany Uses Aircraft as Troop Transport

London, It is reported here that the German side is now using troop transport aircraft to carry German troops occupying Denmark to Norway as reinforcements. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)

London, According to well-informed sources here, reinforcements for the German troops in Norway are being transported by air from Denmark. The Norwegian ambassador to Britain, Koht, met with Foreign Secretary Halifax yesterday to discuss how Britain and France could stop this. Regarding this matter, British officials said that German transport aircraft can carry at most twenty people each. Even if Germany has many such aircraft, the number of troops that Britain and France can transport to Norway by sea will far exceed that. In addition, it is difficult to transport large military equipment by air, and British aircraft can intercept them between Denmark and Norway at any time, so there is nothing to worry about. In summary, after German troops occupied Denmark, they gained six military airfields, two or three civilian airfields, and five seaplane bases. However, Britain, with its naval power and minefields, can control the Skagerrak Strait. No matter how many German aircraft and air bases there are, they are not enough to negate Britain's advantage. (Havas dispatch, 13th)

Berlin, German officials are very optimistic about the war situation: (1) Germany's military position in Norway has been consolidated. (2) Rumors about large-scale naval battles and the British Navy occupying important Norwegian bases have proven to be inaccurate. The "Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" reported that when Churchill was speaking to the House of Commons, it was at the same time that the British Navy was attempting to enter Trondheim and was repulsed. The newspaper mentioned the comments of "The Times" military correspondent Hart, that being able to maintain a base in modern warfare has a 90% chance of success. (Haitong dispatch, 13th)

German 20,000-Ton Battleship Sunk

Stockholm, Norwegian radio broadcasts here claimed that the German 26,500-ton battleship "Gneisenau" had been sunk by Norwegian coastal artillery in Oslofjord. Also sunk there was a German 6,000-ton cruiser, probably the "Emden", and several smaller warships, destroyers and minesweepers. Also sunk outside Kristiansand was the German 6,000 ton cruiser, "Karlsruhe". Off Stavanger, the German destroyer "Eggert" and a large ship were also lost, and a German troop transport ship was sunk off Bergen. Another warship was also hit. Several Norwegian warships were lost, and the number of deaths is unknown. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)

Stockholm, According to a report from Strömstad, Norway, a British fleet attacked several transport ships escorted by German warships in Oslofjord last night. Two of them, carrying large numbers of soldiers, sank near Strömstad. Another ship, loaded with ammunition, sank near Marstrand. (Havas dispatch, 12th)

### Norway Skies: British and German Air Forces in Major Battle; Five British Planes Shot Down; German Side Also Suffers Significant Losses

London: The British Air Ministry announced last night that the British Air Force conducted large-scale reconnaissance flights over the North Sea and the Skagerrak Strait yesterday, searching for enemy ships. It was reported that British bomber squadrons flew into Kleister Fjord and attacked two German ships. British aircraft encountered intense anti-aircraft fire, and five planes were shot down. (Reuters, 13th)

London: According to information obtained in London last night, the British aircraft that attacked Stavanger airfield yesterday were Wellington bombers dispatched by the Coastal Command, escorted by long-range fighter planes. The airfield suffered severe damage, and many German fighter planes and bombers were damaged, with multiple aircraft personnel killed. At the beginning of the attack, three German Junkers bombers were severely damaged, with an estimated twenty casualties. Although the British aircraft encountered intense fire, they sustained no damage. Half an hour later, the Wellington bombers strafed machine gun posts, anti-aircraft batteries, aircraft, and ground planes. After a large fire broke out at the airfield, the British bombers were attacked by German fighter planes, leading to fierce fighting. Only one British bomber failed to return to base. (Reuters, 13th)

Oslo: According to sources in Kristiansand, sixty-six British bombers attempted to cross the German defense line when attacking Kristiansand Bay, and were shot down by German fighter planes over Kristiansand Bay. (Haitong Electric, 13th)

Oslo: According to Haitong News Agency special correspondent Hermann, while on a motorboat in Bergen Harbor yesterday, he witnessed six to eight British Wellington bombers appearing over the harbor. Three German Messerschmitt fighter planes immediately engaged them. A fierce battle ensued at an altitude of 6,000 feet. One British aircraft was hit in the right wing and crashed into the sea. A second British aircraft was hit, caught fire, emitted a lot of smoke, and also crashed into the sea. At that time, three more Messerschmitt fighter planes arrived to assist. The British aircraft immediately fled westward. (Haitong Electric, 13th)

### German Military Communique

Berlin: The German High Command issued a statement today stating that after German reinforcements arrived yesterday, the situation in Norway has become more stable than before. German troops in Narvik continue to occupy important military positions in the area. British attempts to land have no chance of success. Yesterday afternoon, British aircraft attacked Narvik harbor, but not only did they fail to achieve success, but one was shot down by German forces. The situation in the Trondheim area is calm, and coastal defenses have been strengthened. Eight British aircraft attacking Bergen harbor were shot down by anti-aircraft fire. Two German aircraft were damaged. Yesterday afternoon and evening, several air battles occurred in Stavanger. One enemy aircraft was shot down and returned without success. There were no major battles in the Oslo area and the west yesterday. The German Air Force has repeatedly scouted northern and eastern France, and German aircraft have even been sighted over Paris. (Haitong Electric, 13th)

### British Ship "York" Likely Lost; "Cargill" Crew Suffers 18 Casualties

Oslo: According to sources in Trondheim, German reconnaissance aircraft reported yesterday morning that the British heavy cruiser "York" was about to sink, but the ship was no longer visible in the afternoon. The crew of the "York" likely transferred to other British ships as the ship gradually sank. The "York" had a displacement of 8,250 tons and a normal crew of 650. It was hit by two bombs from German aircraft on the 11th. The name of the ship was not known at the time, but it was confirmed yesterday by German aircraft to be the "York." (Haitong Electric, 13th)

Trondheim: According to Haitong News Agency special correspondent Keith, a British destroyer was attacked by a German cruiser near Trondheim and sank within minutes. At the time, the British ship took a winding route and released smoke screens in an attempt to escape. It finally released mines, but they did not hit the German ship. German shells hit the middle of the British ship, causing it to catch fire immediately and sink within minutes. (Haitong, 13th)

London: The Navy Department released the casualty list for the British destroyer Cargill, including five officers missing and presumed dead, seven sailors dead, nine missing and believed dead, and three wounded. (Reuters, 13th)

### Elverum Town Bombed to Ashes

Stockholm: German aircraft formations bombed the Norwegian town of Elverum in shifts today for three hours. The town has been reduced to rubble, but repeated German attacks have been repelled. The fierce resistance of the Norwegian army can be seen from this. (Havas Electric, 13th)

Stockholm: The new radio station of the legitimate Norwegian government broadcast news stating that German aircraft flew to Elverum, Fredrikstad and other cities for large-scale bombing. The city of Halden was also bombed, but fortunately the people had been evacuated and there were no casualties. (Havas Electric, 12th)

Washington: The U.S. Minister to Norway reported to the State Department that the German Air Force bombed the town of Elverum, and it is said that the town has been almost completely destroyed, with only one church and one hospital remaining. Fifty residents were killed. (Havas Electric, 13th)

### Norwegian King Does Not Leave His Country; Sleepless Nights Since the Incident; Escapes Air Raid Unharmed

Helsinki: A local radio station recently broadcast news stating that "a reporter from Svenska Dagbladet visited King Haakon VII of Norway yesterday at a certain location. The King made a statement saying that since the German army invaded, he has had sleepless nights and has not rested, and has not even taken off his military boots, so he feels very tired. As long as there is one foot and one inch of territory in the country, he will not leave the country for a single day. This is his duty and can be announced to the world." According to Minister of Justice Lie, who was by the King's side, when German aircraft bombed Nybergsund yesterday, the King happened to be there. Four bombs exploded near the King's residence, but the King was unharmed. It was truly a blessing from heaven. At the time, German aircraft also used machine guns to strafe downwards, and the King hid by lying down. (Havas News Agency, 13th)

### British and French Extend Minefields in the North Sea; Stretching Over Miles from Holland to Sweden; Aimed at Preventing German Maritime Transport

London: Well-informed sources recently stated that the minefields laid by Britain and France in the North Sea are vast, the largest ever seen. They extend from offshore of the Dutch port of Terschelling in the south to sixty miles south of the Norwegian port of Bergen in the north, and to the southern waters of Sweden in the east, spanning four hundred and twenty miles, two hundred miles wider than any minefield during the last European war. From west to east, there is only one navigable gap of twenty miles wide. As for the Swedish coast, the minefield is laid south of Gothenburg, twenty-five miles wide, with the Swedish territorial waters as the only passage. For this reason, it is extremely difficult for German troops to transport by sea. The only way is to pass through Sweden, but if Sweden does so, it is in danger of being invaded. However, the country is determined to resist aggression, and its coastal defense batteries are very powerful, making it difficult for Germany to succeed. Furthermore, if Germany uses aircraft to transport troops or munitions to Norway, it will be difficult to implement due to the constant patrols of the British and French air forces. In addition, the situation of naval battles is being commented on by experts. There are two reasons why the Navy Department has maintained silence: first, officials want to publish the results after the naval battle is over; second, most of the German fleet has been forced into a corner, and some warships are trying to escape to the north, so it is appropriate not to publish the enemy's losses for the time being. As for the overall war situation, there has been no change today. Only rumors of German troops moving along the borders of the Netherlands and Belgium are rampant, indicating that Germany may intend to invade the Netherlands and Belgium, but there is no definite news to confirm it. (Havas Electric, 12th)

### Norwegian Envoys Abroad Not Yielding; Puppet Government Helpless; Foreign Minister Gutte Arrives in Stockholm

Stockholm: It is heard from responsible sources here that the Nazi Quisling, who set up a puppet government in Norway, has telegraphed Norwegian diplomatic and consular officials, ordering them to obey only Quisling and sever relations with the legitimate government, but has not received a single reply. (Reuters, 13th)

Stockholm: Norwegian Foreign Minister Gutte will arrive here today. His purpose is still being investigated. (Haitong Electric, 13th)

### Fortress Commander Defects; Government Orders Dismissal

Stockholm: It is heard that General Nilse, commander of the Sundvollen Norwegian fortress, has been dismissed for obeying the orders of the Oslo puppet government and obstructing the Norwegian government's mobilization order. (Reuters, 13th)

### Puppet Foreign Minister Rebels; Joins the Army to Participate in the War

Stockholm: Wiener reported that Major Herfu, the puppet foreign minister of the Oslo government, resigned and arrived here yesterday, and immediately flew to the Norwegian military headquarters to join the army. (Reuters, 13th)

### Norwegian Puppet Leader Uses Sweet Talk to Deceive the People

Oslo: Quisling, the Prime Minister of the new Norwegian government, spoke to reporters in Parliament, stating that the direct cause of Germany's invasion of Northern Europe was the British navy's violation of Norwegian neutrality. The Norwegian government did not take any resistance actions, only making weak protests. Norway could not guarantee its interests. Germany hoped to cooperate with the Norwegian government, but the Norwegian government rejected Germany's proposal and responded with general mobilization. The Norwegian government officials have left the capital, and the National Unity Party has had to take on the responsibility of establishing a new government to maintain Norway's freedom and independence and improve the situation of the Norwegian people. When I drafted the political program in 1918, I had no intention of becoming a dictator. At that time, I had not yet heard of the theory of National Socialism. Party politics has become a thing of the past. I will organize a new parliament based on economic and cultural groups, and implement true democratic politics. We do not want to abolish property rights, but will help the people to acquire property. We will also rebuild the military. Norway and the Nordic countries will cooperate closely with most countries. (Haitong Electric, 13th)

### Germany Uses Harsh Measures to Deal with Resistance Elements

Paris: The Oslo radio station in Norway, now in German hands, broadcast a message from the German authorities to the Norwegian people today, stating that "the authorities have set up military courts to try Norwegian criminals who engage in sabotage. Anyone who shoots German officers and soldiers or attempts to prevent the advance of the German army will be handed over to this court for trial. So far, many people have been sentenced to death and executed." Political figures here have commented on this matter, saying that the German propaganda machine has vigorously stated in the past forty-eight hours that the Norwegian people have not resisted the German army at all. Now, martial law is being implemented for these "obedient people," which is a contradiction to this extent. The reason is that Germany expected the Norwegian people to be completely submissive, but it was greatly disappointed, but it still does not want to admit failure. In reality, the small number of German troops landing in Norway are now in a very difficult situation, being attacked by the British and French navies and the Norwegian army. If reinforcements are not sent quickly, it will be difficult to sustain them. However, if German reinforcements want to go to Norway via the Skagerrak and Kattegat Straits, it is extremely dangerous due to the close surveillance of the British and French navies. If they are transported by aircraft, they cannot transport many at a time, which is only a small relief. In this situation, if Germany wants to send reinforcements, it must invade Swedish territory. However, Germany may not want to create another enemy at this time, so it seems hesitant about invading Sweden. The radio station controlled by the German side has recently vigorously stated that Germany can still reach a compromise with the legitimate Norwegian government, in order to leave room for maneuvering, but at the same time, Germany does not abandon the "Quisling puppet government," so that it can still be used when necessary. (Havas Electric, 13th)

### Volunteers from Various Countries Flock to Norway to Assist in the War

Helsinki: A batch of volunteers from Finland and other countries has arrived in Norway and will immediately join the war effort. In addition, the ambulance teams previously sent to Finland, especially those from Norway and France, will be transferred to the Norwegian front line in a short period of time. (Havas Electric, 13th)

### German Troops Land in Denmark; Encounter Some Resistance

Helsinki: The Danish Army Department issued a message through the Danish news agency stating that when the German army invaded southern Denmark, the Danish army engaged in war. Later, the government decided to accept the demands made by Germany before ordering the army to cease fighting. Twelve Danish soldiers were killed in this battle, twenty-nine were injured, and one aircraft was destroyed. (Havas Electric, 12th)

Copenhagen: According to a German naval major speaking to a Haitong News Agency special correspondent, he was ordered to occupy Copenhagen. He sailed into Copenhagen harbor on a merchant ship, but the Danish authorities refused to send a pilot. The German warship knew that most of the Danish navy was parked in the harbor and that there were six fortresses at the port, but the German warship ventured forward and occupied Copenhagen.

### Swedish Prime Minister Reaffirms Determination to Maintain Neutrality; Will Not Allow Foreign Troops to Pass Through; Intensifies Border Defense Measures

Stockholm: Swedish Prime Minister Hansson recently delivered a broadcast speech to the nation, saying, "We have done our best to preserve our country's neutrality and deeply hope to maintain our country's independence with our free judgment and our own actions. We cannot allow any country to use our territory for its own interests. Fortunately, we have not received such a request. Even if there is such a thing, we will definitely refuse it. The severity of the current situation is unprecedented in hundreds of years. The war has spread to our doorstep. It is self-evident how we feel about the misfortunes of our neighbors. We ourselves have also encountered major difficulties. We must make a great determination to preserve our freedom, territory, and honor. "Our national defense must be strengthened, even if it causes difficulties in people's lives. We hope that the people of the country "do not spread rumors, so as not to be used by other countries' propaganda organs. We have been closely watching our country's people who work for foreign countries, so as not to harm the interests of the motherland," (Havas Electric, 12th)

Stockholm: The Swedish government has decided to implement lighting restrictions in many parts of the southern and western coasts. (Reuters, 13th)

Paris: Women and children in Swedish towns are rapidly and automatically evacuating. Swedes are stepping up the construction of air raid shelters. Lighting restrictions were implemented in Swedish towns last night. (Reuters, 13th)

Gothenburg, Sweden: The Swedish coast defense line, from the Norwegian border to Karlskrona, entered a state of constant alert yesterday. The most important event of the day was the laying of minefields by Britain and France in the Kattegat Strait, between the Danish islands, south of Bergen Harbor along the Norwegian coast, and to the Dutch coast, which is the route that German troops and munitions must take to Norway. According to Swedish officials, if the British and French plans to prevent German maritime transport are successful, then Germany will definitely try to use Swedish territory to transport by land. Sweden will never support Germany's actions in a way that is detrimental to Norway, even passive support is not desired. Therefore, Sweden itself is in danger of being invaded by Germany. The most threatened areas in Sweden are Malmo harbor, Helsingborg harbor (both are no more than four nautical miles from the Danish coast), and Gothenburg harbor (only forty-five nautical miles from the northern tip of Denmark). However, according to military experts, the Swedish authorities have recently laid minefields along the coast. If Germany wants to send troops to land in the above three places, it will not be easy. As for the German troops in the Oslo area, if they advance to the southeast in an attempt to enter Swedish territory, the Norwegian troops in the vicinity, who are responsible for protecting the roads and railways leading to Sweden, will definitely resist them, and it is feared that the German army will be difficult to achieve its goal. In general, if Germany goes to war with Sweden, it must first send aircraft to bomb it, in order to destroy morale, similar to the bombing of Polish cities. For this reason, the Swedish authorities have stepped up preparations for air defense. The public knows that the situation is extremely serious, and is able to maintain a calm attitude towards all defensive measures. It is heard that the authorities have found a simple and effective way to make the country's airfields available to its own aircraft, while enemy aircraft cannot land. In short, Sweden has made considerable military preparations and is determined to defend its neutrality, which is beyond doubt. (Havas Electric, 13th)

### Germany Issues Serious Warning to Sweden

Amsterdam: According to political figures in Berlin, Germany is continuing to issue serious warnings to Sweden. A German spokesman said last night that Sweden's recent future depends on whether it prevents countries from harming its neutrality. If Sweden prevents them, then Germany has no reason to occupy bases in Sweden. If the Norwegian government flees to Sweden and continues to govern from there, then Sweden must bear the consequences. (Reuters, 13th)

London: Unconfirmed reports in neutral diplomatic circles here yesterday stated that Germany has requested Sweden to allow German troops and food to travel to Norway via Swedish railways. This information is inconsistent with the report broadcast by Swedish radio that German troops have cut off the railway between Oslo and Gothenburg. The Swedish embassy here told the Associated Press that it was unaware of Germany's request and doubted the veracity of the information. Sweden is determined to maintain its strict neutrality. (Associated Press, 13th)

### French Newspaper Observations: European War Situation: Sweden and the Balkans May Be Drawn into the Vortex

Paris: Newspapers here all predict that Sweden and the Balkans will be attacked by the Germans. Le Journal de Paris published an article by George Byron, which stated that "we must not forget that Sweden will be attacked, and judging from Germany's diplomatic preparations, it can be inferred that Southeastern Europe has long been its target." The famous military expert Maurice also published an argument in Le Petit Parisien, stating that "there are a total of two German divisions in Norway. If the Norwegians can effectively assemble their reserves, they will be in great difficulty. Now Hitler must decide to invade Sweden in order to assist the German troops in Norway via Sweden. It is expected that Hitler will take this step." (Reuters, 13th)

### Britain in Contact Regarding the Protection of Iceland; The U.S. is Concerned About Greenland Residents; Requests the Red Cross to Prepare Relief

London: It is rumored that the British government is in contact with the government of Iceland to exchange views on the issue of the protection of the island by Britain and France. This statement was recently confirmed by diplomatic figures here, but they believe that the U.S. government has not been consulted by the countries concerned regarding this matter. (Havas Electric, 13th)

Washington: When asked by reporters whether the Monroe Doctrine should be applied to Greenland, the President replied that this issue is not under discussion at present, and said that his consideration of the Greenland issue is focused on humanitarian aspects and is not based on politics. The President also said that Greenland's relationship with North America is closer than with Europe. If Danish supply ships cannot arrive there this summer, he intends to ask the American Red Cross to organize a relief group to help the residents of the area, because Greenland's 17,000 residents rely on the timely arrival of these supply ships.

### Britain Considers Detaining Danish Ships; Philippine Authorities Make Representations; Plan to Lease or Buy Nordic Merchant Ships

Washington: According to information from the Danish embassy here last night, Britain and France are considering detaining 705 Danish merchant ships (totaling 1,175,000 tons). A spokesman for the British embassy said that in view of Denmark's recent recognition of German protection, Britain and France may have recognized Denmark as a non-neutral country, and therefore the detention of Danish ships is very possible. The spokesman also said that the British Navy Department is studying the matter, but has not yet decided. According to the Danish embassy here, the embassy has also heard of the British news. The State Department and the Interior Department here stated that they have not received reports on whether senior US-Philippine officials are asking the British government to release ships detained in port, as it is reported that these ships are loaded with cargo for the Philippines. However, well-informed sources say that this action is related to British policy in Northern Europe, and that the British have openly warned these ships to enter British ports to await investigation and decision. (Associated Press, 13th)

Hong Kong: Hong Kong shipping circles said today that they are still awaiting a decision from the authorities on whether Nordic ships detained can fly the British flag or fly the flags of various Nordic countries separately. They have not yet received news on whether these ships can be released. (Associated Press, 13th)

Manila: Philippine Finance Minister Roxas said today that the Philippines is negotiating with the British, Norwegian, and U.S. governments to lease or purchase Nordic merchant ships sailing between the Philippines, because, according to Roxas, 40 percent of Philippine exports are shipped by Nordic merchant ships, and the current British detention of Nordic merchant ships has a serious impact on Philippine export trade. Also, given the possibility of Sweden being drawn into the European war, the Philippines may transfer Swedish merchant ships to the Philippines. (Associated Press, 13th)

The Anglo-French Blockade Line Against Germany
Resembles a Sea Wall
The Economic War Takes Place in Neutral Countries as the Battlefield

The blockade of Europe by the navies of Great Britain and France extends from the frigid coasts of Iceland in the west to tropical Ceylon in the east, meandering like a rainbow for eight thousand miles (editor's note: it has actually expanded to Vladivostok in the Far East). The vastness of the area and the thoroughness of the methods are unprecedented in the history of blockades. Calling it a sea "Great Wall" is certainly not an overstatement.

In the Nordic region, as in the previous Great War, there are maritime patrol convoys far apart; one team crosses the English Channel, and another team is stationed between Scotland and Iceland, patrolling six hundred miles of turbulent waves. As for the southern part, it has changed completely. In the Mediterranean during the last European war, the British fleet blockaded the mouth of the Adriatic Sea, which was sufficient. This time, in addition to Gibraltar, Malta, and the Suez Canal, it is necessary to reach the mouth of the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf.

This type of blockade is similar to that of the last World War, and is a two-way blockade. Its purpose is to prevent all of Germany's overseas trade, so that it cannot use neutral countries as intermediaries to engage in import and export trade. When ships from neutral countries are slowly sailing toward Rotterdam or Trieste, their encounters seem similar to normal times. However, a destroyer will suddenly emerge on the horizon and send a serious signal: "Stop immediately, a small ship is coming."

This kind of opening is no different from what neutral ships encountered during the last World War. However, new methods evolved during the previous war have been very effective since the outbreak of this war. In the past, when neutral ships entered the blockade line and were searched, it was carried out on the spot. If there were no prohibited items, the delay was only the time of inspection. Today, as maritime transport becomes increasingly complex, the inspection procedures cannot be handled solely by the Navy. Therefore, if a neutral ship is intercepted at sea by a British warship, it will be escorted to a blockade port for search and must remain for one day to two weeks before obtaining a port clearance.

The search work is still done by naval personnel, or at least, the search must be directed by naval personnel. Most of the actual work is done by customs officials. These people are more adept at searching for smuggling than naval personnel. If a neutral ship is indeed not carrying prohibited items, it must be released. The final decision-making power does not belong to the Navy but to the London Economic Warfare Department—a term that, like a flash of lightning, has greatly changed the modern blockade method. After a neutral ship is escorted into a blockade port, the Navy becomes the police of the area.

The blockade ports are the gates of the blockade "Great Wall," and there are fourteen of them, starting from the hidden and small Kirkwall Bay in the Orkney Islands of northern Scotland to Trincomalee Port in Ceylon. The largest and most complicated of these should be at the mouth of the Thames River, only one or two hours away from London.

There are many ships berthed in the blockade ports on both sides of the English Channel. Most of them are in a hazy gray color, standing still on the horizon. At night, the masts of the ships do not hang lights, the lights on the shore are all off, the buoys are removed, and the fog warning horns are silent. If you can take a small naval speedboat to sea, you can see the parked ships stretching for miles. - Ocean liners with their heads held high, passengers leaning on the railings and looking into the distance. Giant cargo ships carrying large quantities of goods, the sides of the ships almost touching the water, swaying like floating warehouses—all these ships have the flags of neutral countries hanging on them, Holland, Belgium, Denmark, Greece, Japan all have them, and the national flags are painted on the sides of the ships. In this vast world, the silent and lifeless phenomenon has never been seen on such a large scale on the anchorage, twenty or thirty ships moored at the port.

After the ship to be inspected is anchored with two anchors, it raises a black "X" white flag, which is a request, according to international flag signals, to send a search team on board. It is not easy for the Navy inspectors to board the rope ladder of a giant ship directly from a small boat in the turbulent waves. After boarding, the captain hands the ship's documents to the inspector, closes the radio room, and then the inspection begins. In peacetime, only the customs is interested in the ship's cargo manifest. Now, the blockading country is the same as the customs in peacetime. After obtaining the manifest, the inspector telegraphed the original to the London Economic Warfare Department, which investigated what kind of people were consigning and receiving the goods. The Navy personnel investigate the ship itself in the blockade port. If there is no suspicion, they often use the manifest as the standard without searching. Sometimes, it is found that the cargo carried does not match what is stated on the manifest. For example, "waste oil" is often found to be crude oil for refining "gasoline" after chemical testing. The so-called "onion heads" can sometimes bounce more than ten feet in the air after being thrown hard on the deck. After inspection, it is discovered that they are rubber stacked on top of each other. The water loaded on the ship sometimes exceeds the amount required—sometimes, one hundred tons of brass are installed on both sides of the bow, which is not stated on the manifest. This kind of forgery is difficult to escape the experts' eyes.

If there is any suspicious part of the ship, the Navy immediately orders customs officials to board the ship for a thorough inspection. They have a clear understanding of smuggling methods and know where goods can be hidden on the ship. Under normal circumstances, they can search the entire ship in one hour. In special circumstances, they will take the ship into the port and remove all the goods.

At this time, the London Economic Warfare Department is also like a giant mill turning, and this civil department holds some of the most powerful weapons in modern warfare. It has mobilized Britain's great economic power and banking, insurance, transportation, and commercial organizations all over the world. The Navy only inspects ships at sea, while the Economic Warfare Department can monitor the source of prohibited items, observing its activities long before the ship is loaded. It is extremely difficult for German overseas export firms that are blacklisted to transport, insure, or obtain bank credit. Sometimes the department's representatives in various parts of the world provide various conveniences to German exporters, but the unloading point of their goods has been invisibly changed to Britain instead of Germany.

The Anglo-French blockade employs both economic and naval power. The ship manifest telegrams sent from the London Economic Warfare Department are only the last step in monitoring prohibited items. What the department's experts want to know most when inspecting the manifest is whether the neutral country's consignee listed on the manifest is the final consignee. If the goods listed on the manifest are indeed sold in neutral countries, there is of course no problem. If any part of it is transported to Germany, the situation is different.

There are different methods for proving the final destination of the goods. One section of the Economic Warfare Department is familiar with the importers in neutral countries neighboring Germany, another section is familiar with the goods that neutral countries usually need, another section is familiar with what Germany needs to purchase, and another section is familiar with South American export firms. When more than a dozen sections in the department investigate the same incident, even goods that can be concealed in the manifest for a while will have to be completely exposed. These manifests and various documents are transferred to the Prohibited Items Committee.

This solemn group of more than a dozen people is the highest meeting for managing prohibited items. Every day, even on Sundays, they have to sit around a horseshoe-shaped table in the department's wood-paneled office, day and night, to deal with prohibited items. If it is decided that the manifest has nothing to do with the capture court, the decision will be telegraphed to the authorities in the blockade port, and a small boat will be sent to the mooring to give the shipowner an export permit, wishing him "bon voyage."

If the committee believes that the goods listed on the manifest should be transferred to the capture court, the procedures are special. The capture court cannot open the trial immediately and must wait for thirty days to allow the parties concerned to come forward to defend themselves. During this period, the ship carrying the goods cannot be detained, so the customs will unload the goods and let the ship sail.

The capture court has nothing to do with the Navy at first, except for the anchor emblem hanging behind the judge's seat. This court is a branch of the ordinary court. Once the prohibited items enter the scope of the law, they will quietly wait for legal processing. If the court believes that this item belongs to the enemy of Britain, it will be judged as a legal capture and confiscated. Otherwise, Britain must compensate the neutral country for the loss.

As for the blockade of German export goods, it has its own legal standing, and the method is simpler. If a neutral ship departs from the European continent and is intercepted by a British warship on the way, it will also be escorted to the blockade port, as mentioned above. However, if the cargo carried is suspected of being German export goods—whether it belongs to Germans or neutral parties, and is manufactured in Germany—it must be sent to the London Enemy Export Goods Committee. Before the committee makes a judgment, the neutral country's consignee is allowed to defend himself. Those that are ordered to be unloaded by the committee must be detained in Britain until the end of the war and cannot be regarded as legal captures and confiscated.

All that has been said is just a fragment of the blockade "Great Wall." Since the construction of this "Great Wall," Germany's overseas trade has been declining, and what it can maintain is only trade with neighboring countries. The importance of this market has far exceeded the situation twenty-five years ago. During the last World War, Germany was closed off in all aspects except in Switzerland, Holland, and Scandinavia. Today, except for France, Germany's neighbors are all neutral countries. These countries within the naval embargo line are currently the main battlefields in the economic war. In addition to the strict naval blockade, Britain and France are using their great resources to compete with Germany to expel it from the neutral country market. This is the reason why Britain and France signed commercial agreements with neutral countries. (Translated from the New York Times)

### Japanese Troops Invade Jieyang Again
### Chinese Troops Attack Chaoan

Shantou Correspondence: The Japanese troops on the Chao-Shan Railway line have recently invaded Jieyang again. The Tianpu unit in Fuyang dispatched 300 infantry and cavalry and 200 puppet troops at 8:00 AM on March 31st, advancing along two routes towards Qingmashan and Bailianhu, attacking Dentang, Guishan, and Yujiao on the Anjie Highway, attempting to break out of Fengkou and Quxi.

### Sports News
### Football Season Closes
### Sino-French Charity Match Yesterday
### French Merchants Beat Lido
### Net Loss of Three Goals in the First Half, Totaling Two to Four

The 1939-40 football season ended yesterday with a charity match between Lido and French merchants as a farewell ceremony. The exciting winter sports have come to an end, waiting for the autumn wind to rise again and reinvigorate. The Lido-France match started at 2:30 PM at Yiyuan. The French Concession supervisor and consul, and the honorary chairman of the French Chamber of Commerce, Mr. Eugene, came to kick off, and three bands from the Children's Asylum, the French Army, and the French Municipal Council played on the field. The melodious cadence showed majesty, especially the Children's Asylum Band, under the leadership of the director of the hospital, Pan Hongding, was only established for four months, and its achievements were commendable. Football fans and philanthropists who admired the name as onlookers were no less than 15,000 people, and the situation was extremely enthusiastic. The French merchants came with all their strength, and their military strength was very strong. In the first half, they won three goals. Lido cooperated to counterattack and regained two goals, but the gain did not make up for the loss, and finally lost to four with two. The absence of Lido's Cao Xu Li San guests was the main reason for the failure. The lineup of both sides in yesterday's match is as follows:

French Chamber of Commerce

Willie Hua

Mashaner, Te

Colett

Peyer, Gekle

Glenn

Jiemxiu Te, Robert Stowe

Fafanxiao, Sebos

Lido Association

Qin Bi Gao

Yan Shixin, Zhang Lingeng

Yun Feng

Meng Yiliang, Jiang Zhaoxiang

Wan Jin, Sun Jinshun, Huang Kehou

Jiang Chao, Zhang Mingsheng

Lost Three Cities in a Row

Lido attacked first, Yongneng was able to go deep, and the French merchants' counterattack also failed. It was not until 17 minutes that the ball entered the Lido penalty area. Robert Stowe quickly fell empty, and Jiem Huate arrived in time, lifted his leg and shot from 15 yards, low and fast, and Bi Gao missed the shot. Lido lost a goal first. Jinshun took the ball and went to attack, but was intercepted, Mingsheng failed to break through the old horse, and returned without success. In 29 minutes, Jiem Huate sent a long shot to Huang Mao, and Lingeng was blocked, Bao Xiu Te took the opportunity to enter straight in and broke the net with a flat shot, making it two to zero. In the 32nd minute, Lian Wan Jin cut in unsuccessfully, Jinshun rushed empty, and Lido's defense was again warned. Huang Mao quickly missed the opportunity, and Bi Gao's support also missed. Huang Mao shot back, Shixin shoveled and saved, and Hua's gate was again trapped. Lido lost three goals in a row and actively counterattacked. Tie tui two shots, Wan Jin one arrow, were all saved by Willie. At the end of the first half, the French merchants took the lead with three to zero.

Lido Suffered a Setback

The battle started again, Lido's generals gritted their teeth and vowed to retaliate. Jiang Chao approached, Willie rushed out, the goal was wide open, but Lido had no one to respond, missing a great opportunity. In the tenth minute, Jinshun got the help of Mingsheng and knocked his feet flat at 25 yards, Willie, although skilled, was also helpless. After Lido pulled back a goal, it became active, but Zhang Lingeng accidentally kissed the ball with his hand in the penalty area at 21 minutes, and was fined a twelve-yard penalty. Fortunately, Huang Mao's penalty missed, and there was no news. Fafanxiao fiercely shot, Bi Gao received and missed again, and Qin calmly kicked it out, turning danger into safety because no one rushed in. At 35 minutes, Jiem knocked low, Yiliang was eager to rescue and passed it back to Bi Gao. Bi Gao did not defend, and it rolled into the net. Lido lost a goal in vain. In the last ten minutes, Jinshun shot the goal post and bounced back. Wan Jin greeted him and kicked it urgently. At that time, Willie rushed out and did not return, hitting his own goal. Not long after, the gold was rung, and Lido lost to the French merchants with two to four.

### Public Exhibition Cup Handball Tournament
### Second Round
### Order Announced

The first round of the 10th Public Exhibition Cup Sino-Western Youth Handball Championship has ended. The Chinese Youth team won a great victory with 12-3. The second round is still 10 groups of singles and 5 groups of doubles. The singles are scheduled to start the day after tomorrow (Tuesday), and the doubles will start the week after, on the 23rd (Wednesday). The lineups on both sides have been readjusted, and the most noteworthy is the return of the former Western Youth doubles champions Zhu Kuan and Sun Daosheng, and the Hua Fenggang and Yan Peiqiu as the main force. Although Hua Yan also served as the first doubles in the first round, because the opponent gave up, they did not have the opportunity to exert their power. This time they will meet this year's Western Youth alliance leader F. Chuckling, there will be a fierce battle. Zhu Sun is an old partner and has been in charge of the Shanghai fog power for many years. This time, they are cooperating again and acting as Feng Fu again, which should not reduce the wealth of the year. In the first singles, the Chinese Youth team changed to Sun Jialu. Sun's opponent is this year's Western Youth alliance leader F. Chuckling. In general, the Chinese Youth team has an average personnel strength, and victory is very confident.

New Excerpts from Old Newspapers Sixty-Seven Years Ago (354) (See This Newspaper from the Twelfth Year of the Tongzhi Reign of the Qing Dynasty)
### Testing Water Mines

On the sixth day of this month, the Governor-General of Zhili, Li, arrived at Xigu and summoned the students of the Water Mine Bureau to test water mines. For several days, a three-mile stretch of the Wuliang River was closed to all ships. The students had arranged the water mines in the river, connected by lines and marked with signs. When the Governor-General arrived from afar, the open space on both banks was filled with onlookers. The demonstration was to secure the Dagu waterway. The bureau first drew a map of the waterway, also marking the locations of the water mines. Governor-General Li personally directed the detonation of specific mines. After the first bugle call, a mine exploded from the riverbed, sending water three or four hundred feet into the air. When the bugle sounded again, seven mines detonated simultaneously, creating an even greater explosion. The banks shook as if in an earthquake. Seven more mines were detonated, all using electricity. After that, they demonstrated contact mines. A small boat hit a long piece of wood attached to a mine, which immediately ignited. Fortunately, it was only a demonstration, so there was no damage; otherwise, it would have been reduced to powder. Next, they demonstrated naval mines. Five ships were arranged, each carrying a five-pound mine. A target was set up at a distance, resembling a ship. At the sound of a bugle, all the ships simultaneously detonated their mines. All that could be seen was a wall of water, obscuring the location of the ships. The onlookers were terrified. Shortly after, the water subsided, revealing watermarks on each ship, but the ships remained in place. The Governor-General was delighted! He highly praised Instructor Bai, and also rewarded the diligent students with merit badges and valuable items. Personnel from the Dagu Navy in the bureau, after the water mine demonstration, dove into the river to retrieve the mine frames. One person was able to stay underwater for two minutes and three seconds, another for two minutes and forty seconds, and the rest for about two minutes. By then it was six o'clock, and the Governor-General returned. It is said that Governor-General Li was very satisfied with this water mine demonstration.

Children's Weekly: Methods for Children to Prevent Illness by Qian Fei

Spring is here, a season loved by adults, but children are susceptible to various seasonal infectious diseases, especially given the unpredictable weather. This year's spring, with its unstable temperatures, has seen seasonal infectious diseases like diphtheria, smallpox, and [illegible] already appearing, posing a serious threat to children's health. Therefore, we must know how to prevent illness.

1.  Vaccination: Everyone should get vaccinated against smallpox. Children should also get vaccinated against diphtheria, typhoid, scarlet fever, and whooping cough early, as these are common childhood infectious diseases.

2.  Diet: Extreme care must be taken with hot and cold foods. Carelessness can easily lead to illness. Children especially need nutritious food because a lack of nutrition is detrimental to their health. However, on the isolated island now, countless refugee children can barely get enough to eat, let alone pay attention to nutrition. Therefore, we hope that wealthy people and children from well-off families will save on unnecessary expenses and use their money to help refugee children, so that they can have adequately nutritious food. Otherwise, even if they are rescued in shelters, they are likely to die easily if infectious diseases spread. Thus, to truly save them, we must pay attention to their nutritional needs and prevent them from becoming ill.

3.  Exercise: Children should pay attention to physical exercise, especially in spring. Avoid overexertion, and get adequate rest and recreation. This can strengthen the body, and a strong body is less likely to get sick.

4.  Parks: In this bright spring weather, go to parks often to play, absorb fresh air, and feel refreshed, which will increase the body's resistance and make it harder for diseases to invade.

5.  Hygiene: Pay attention to hygiene in daily life, such as not spitting everywhere and keeping clothes clean, as seasonal diseases are mostly caused by the spread of germs, which are often found in the sputum of sick people and on unclean clothes. These easily enter the mouth and cause illness. Therefore, everyone must not ignore these things and must maintain hygiene anytime and anywhere in daily life.

Dear children, if you can pay attention to the above, you will surely be healthy and not get seasonal infectious diseases. Because during this time of war, the health of the entire nation is crucial to the strength of the country. Therefore, your efforts to prevent illness are not just for yourselves, but you are also shouldering a heavy burden. You must have a strong body to shoulder it!

Children's Treasures by Ji Fufang

We have six treasures. From today on, we must make full use of them!

Brain: Rich thoughts, correct judgment.

Eyes: See far and see much, and discover new things.

Ears: Listen to everything related to us, and listen carefully.

Mouth: Don't be afraid to speak your mind, and don't be afraid to ask questions.

Hands: Work diligently, and experiment with things you're not familiar with. Create new things on earth.

Feet: Always move forward toward the light, never stopping, never retreating.

Most importantly, these six treasures must work together and move toward success under the same goal.

The Temperature Underfoot by Jin Zhen

The cold winter quietly passes, and spring arrives. The ground is full of spring - the trees are green, the flowers are blooming, the birds are singing, the weather is warming... all this clearly shows that spring has truly arrived. Even Ah-hui's clothes have changed from thick winter clothes to spring cotton-padded clothes, and school has given a few days of spring break. Undoubtedly, spring has come.

One day, Ah-hui somehow said to Ah-ming, "Now that it's spring, and the air above ground is warm, is it also spring in the ground beneath our feet?"

Ah-ming was pleased to hear his younger brother ask such a question because it's not easy to come up with a meaningful question. So he gladly replied, "That's a good question, but the seasons above and below ground don't match our imagination. In other words, even though it's spring above ground, it's not spring below."

"Why is that? What season is it below ground then?"

"That's because the ground is not very good at conducting heat. The temperature changes that occur with the changing seasons above ground are very slowly transmitted to the depths of the earth. Foreign countries have conducted actual measurements, but we rarely do such work here. According to their results, at a depth of about ten feet from the surface, the warmest time of year is two and a half months later than above ground. That is, if the end of June is the hottest time above ground, the ground won't reach its hottest until mid-September. Conversely, the coldest time of year in the ground is two and a half months later than above ground. That is, if the end of January is the coldest time above ground, the ground won't reach its coldest until mid-May. The deeper the ground, the slower the transmission of cold and heat will be, and the rate of change will be almost imperceptible. So the ground we stand on will never have the same climate as the ground about ten feet beneath our feet. If it's late winter and early spring above ground, the ground may still be in autumn. This is best demonstrated by the fact that before the war when we were in the countryside, there was no running water, and we got our drinking water from wells. Why does well water feel warm in the winter and cool in the summer? Because it's winter above ground (and wells are dug very deep, at least ten feet deep), but it's still autumn underground, so the temperature is naturally higher than in winter, and we feel that it's warm. We feel the coolness of well water in the summer for the same reason. This phenomenon is closely related to the survival of underground plants and animals. Therefore, the organisms we find at a certain depth can tell us some of their characteristics, that is, the kind of environment the organisms are suited to live in. I've told you everything I know. Do you understand?"

Xiqing to Hold International Children's Music Competition by Xinying

The Shanghai YMCA Boys' Department recently held a Shanghai children's music competition on the 2nd of this month in the auditorium of its Eight Immortals Bridge branch to promote music and develop talent. The number of children participating was significant. It is said that after the YMCA, the Western YMCA on Jing'an Temple Road will also hold an international children's music competition.

Indeed, in recent years in Shanghai, not only adults have developed a considerable interest in music, but children's interest is also very strong. Therefore, a large number of children, thirty-six in total, participated in the YMCA's Shanghai children's music competition. They were all under the age of ten, but they competed in singing, violin, and piano, and their performances were very good. Their skill and proficiency were unexpected. The facts tell us that these young musicians have great musical talent. With the right guidance, they will easily become excellent musicians in the future.

As mentioned above, after the YMCA, the Western YMCA will also hold an international children's music competition. The difference between the two competitions is that the former is limited to children of Chinese nationality, while the latter is international in nature, regardless of nationality. Any child with musical talent can register and participate. According to the YMCA's plan, they originally intended to select children who won the Shanghai children's music competition to represent China in the Western YMCA's international children's music competition. Because there are many excellent young musicians among the foreign children in Shanghai, winning awards is not easy. We deeply hope that the Chinese children participating in this competition can overwhelm the children from various countries, win the victory, and bring glory to Shanghai children!

Black Brothers (14) by Yimu

Xi didn't know why, but suddenly felt scared, but his desire for gold covered up his alarm, and he rushed forward. A band of dark clouds rose to the horizon, and flashes of lightning shot out from the darkness. Amidst the lightning flashes, piles of dark waves rolled up and down, covering the entire sky. Only where the sun had set was flat, a red like a lake of blood. A gust of wind suddenly blew up, shattering the blood lake and scattering it far into the darkness. When Xi reached the shore of the Golden River, the waves were black, as black as storm clouds, but the spray was as red as fire. The rushing of the water and the lightning flashed in his eyes. The ground beneath his feet gave way, and the sound of the water drowned out his cries. The sound of the Golden River roared in the darkness, and the rapids rushed past the "two black stones."

Geller was worried because his brother Xi had gone and not returned, but he didn't know what to do. He had no money and couldn't make a living, so he had to go back to being a goldsmith's apprentice. He worked very hard, but his wages were very low. After a month or two of this, he became tired of it and decided to try his luck at the Golden River himself. He secretly thought, "The little king looks very gentle. I don't think he will turn me into a black stone." So he went to the pastor, who granted his request and immediately gave him some holy water. Geller put bread and a water bottle in a basket and set off for the mountains early in the morning.

His two older brothers were already exhausted from crossing the glacier. He didn't expect crossing the river to be twenty times more difficult than it was for them. He wasn't very strong and had little experience climbing mountains. He fell several times, dropping his basket and bread, and was terrified by the strange sound under the ice. He lay down on the grass to rest for a long time. After crossing the glacier, he had to climb the mountain again, and it was the hottest time of day. He climbed for an hour and felt parched, just like his two older brothers, and prepared to drink water. Suddenly, he saw an old man coming down the mountain path above him, leaning on a cane, looking very tired. As soon as the old man saw Geller, he said, "My child, I am so thirsty I am about to faint. Please give me some water." Geller looked up at him. The man was pale and pitiful, so he quickly handed him the water bottle and said, "Grandpa, drink quickly, but please don't drink it all." But the old man drank a lot, taking away two-thirds of it, before returning the water bottle to Geller. Geller said goodbye to him and happily went on his way. He felt that the mountain path was much flatter, and there were two or three blades of grass growing on the stones. He thought he had never heard such pleasant insect noises.

Geller walked for an hour and became very thirsty. He had to drink some water, but just as he was about to raise the water bottle, he saw a child moaning by the roadside, begging him for some water. Geller struggled for a moment and decided to endure it a little longer. He quickly put the water bottle to the child's lips, who only took a few sips, and then it was empty. The child smiled slightly, stood up, and ran down the mountain. Geller watched him go, gradually becoming as small as a star, and then continued climbing the mountain.

Jesus and the City (2) (3) The sins of the city, amidst the beautiful religions. Jesus also saw the great sins of the city. The city's surface is covered by a [illegible] of sins, showing a paralysis-like whiteness, all kinds of sinners, all kinds of ways of committing crimes, it is simply Satan's world. Philanthropists spend their efforts for it, legislators work hard for it, publishers are busy for it, they all want to remedy one in ten thousand. If the sins of the city can be accumulated, I am afraid that the entire city's air will turn smelly. Society does not care much about the act of committing crimes, but the consequences of sins change the color of the city. Therefore, the city authorities have taken some measures to remedy this. They build a prison in a corner of the city to reduce the number of criminals on the surface. In another corner, they build a mental hospital to provide support for the mentally ill. In yet another corner, they set up a vagrant factory to reduce the number of vagrants on the streets. This is a method for the city to protect itself, which cannot be said to be bad. (4) The institutions of the city. The city has many institutions that serve society, such as the YMCA, churches, orphanages, nursing homes, social welfare centers, schools, hospitals, etc. All of these are to save people's bodies and minds, so that they do not fall and regress. At the same time, on the other hand, there are many dance halls, gambling venues, bars, etc. Many of these places have unmentionable secrets in their bones, which Jesus understood completely. (To be continued) If you want to study in detail, please send a letter to P.O. Box 1227.

The Photography of Vanishing Techniques in the Performing Arts by Qinghui

"The Invisible Man" is a famous work by the great thinker H.G. Wells. All the Hollywood companies wanted to make it with all their might, but they were afraid to try it lightly because of the difficulty of filming. As a result, Universal Studios got there first.

In terms of filming techniques, director James Whale spent two years, asking dozens of experts to research it. At first, they wanted to use thin steel wires to hang the hats and clothes in the air, as if to represent the invisible man. But James Whale was not satisfied, saying that this method could have been used a few years ago, but if it were used now, it would be ridiculous!

Later, Whale finally came up with a perfect solution. In less than half a year, "The Invisible Man" was completed successfully. After it was released, anyone who watched the looming strange man felt incredibly strange and admired it as a great feat. Now, "The New Invisible Man" is being released again. The audience must ask, "How was this invisible strange man filmed?" If you ask director Whale, he will put on a serious face and say with a smile, "This is a patented secret that has been registered."

But sometimes he reveals a little bit, saying, "When filming this film, the help of mirrors was very great. The famous artist Houdini once used ten large mirrors to make his body disappear on stage. When we filmed this film, we more or less used his old tricks. The invisible strange man in the film is able to partially disappear thanks to the all-powerful camera, which is also a new invention made by using his old wisdom and scientific improvements."

"But there are still several points that are not perfect. For example, this scientist who can become invisible cannot hide the food in his stomach after eating before it is digested. When it rains, the rain pouring off his shoulders is easily noticed. When he walks in the snow, his footprints are clearly visible, and so on, all of which need to be improved."

A Glimpse of the Arts by Qiu Sheng of Xiaotian

Why do I speak of autumn? It is Cheng Yanqiu and Huang Guiqiu. Why do I speak of the sound of autumn? The singing of the two gentlemen, each with its own strengths, is worthy of being recorded. Why do I speak of sound and not color? Looking at the prime of their lives, in the late spring of peaches and plums, I would rather speak of sound than of color.

Cheng Yanqiu's level of achievement and depth of skill are unmatched today. This time in the South, his fire has become even purer. After brilliance, it returns to simplicity, and in simplicity, it has a skill that others cannot achieve. The way he uses his voice and sings his lines is like the work of gods, without any artificial traces. The way he pronounces his words is as heavy as a thousand pounds, with a sharp edge. His skillful control of his mouth is surpassed only by Wang Yaoqing in this world. Without innate intelligence and diligent pursuit, he could not have achieved this. I still remember more than ten years ago when Yanqiu first created his new style of singing. Although it had many fanciful changes, it often had a humming sound, and it was used too much. The pronunciation was purely from Beijing dialect. The level tone was accurate, but the rising and departing tones were often the opposite. Yanqiu's foundation in old dramas was deep, so in one play, the same rising tone word was sometimes sung in Beijing dialect and sometimes in Central Plains dialect. The same was true for the departing tone. If you examined it closely, you would find contradictions that could not be explained. Those who follow Cheng's style are not worth discussing. Now, listening to his singing, these two major flaws are almost non-existent. Without great effort and great perseverance, how could he have achieved this? Even Cheng and Zhu's deep thinking and understanding of the way are no more than this effort. When I listen to Yanqiu's singing, I feel happy and intoxicated, immersed in the song and forgetting all my worries. The ancients said that the skill of writing can be divided into three stages: at first, one seeks only to be even and straight, then one strives for danger and uniqueness, and finally one returns to evenness and straightness. Yanqiu has already reached the third stage of skill.

Guiqiu's voice, in its broad and bright parts, can be compared to Lanfang's, and in its strong parts, it can compete with Xiaoyun's. It is truly said that he is blessed by nature. It is a pity that he neither strives for danger nor walks on the path of simplicity, hovering between the two. Those who love him feel unable to express themselves in words. I once heard that the singing of the old master De Lin was as delicate as peach blossoms in bloom and as vigorous as pine and cypress trees. Later, I carefully examined it and found that the melodies were all ordinary and the pronunciation was often two or three out of ten wrong. If you gave his same tune to someone else to sing, it would be plain and uninteresting. But when it came from De Lin's mouth, it lingered in my ears and made me forget the taste of meat for three months. Why is this? Because his method of using his voice and pronouncing words was complete, and his breath control was appropriate. Yanqiu, without a good voice, would not dare to use it like this. Lanfang, although his voice was good, his breath was not full, so he would not dare to use it like this either. Therefore, each of them opened up their own path and perfected their use of their voice according to their own strengths. Each had their own breath control, which is what is meant by different paths leading to the same destination. Guiqiu's voice seems to be able to directly follow De Lin's. The method of imitating him does not lie in the superficial likeness of the melodies and pronunciations, but in deeply studying his method of using his voice and breath. Be careful not to pick up the leftovers of Mei and Cheng and mix them in, as that would be a flaw. Learning songs is like learning calligraphy. It is easy to imitate the frame, but difficult to capture the spirit. De Lin is dead, and no one has taken his place. I hope Guiqiu will devote himself to the deep study of his spirit, so that those of us with a Zhou Lang complex can hear the clear and strong style of music again.

Tang Ruoqing's younger sister, Ruoying, is also a rising star in the drama world.

Chen Mei Collaborate for the Third Time as the Two Leads in "Huang Tianba"

Chen Yunshang Will Return to Shanghai Soon by Haixing
--Starring in "Su Wu Shepherding Sheep"

Chen Yunshang will return to Shanghai around the 20th of this month. The work she will be starring in is not "Zhuo Wenjun," but "Su Wu Shepherding Sheep," written by Zhou Yibai and directed by Bu Wancang. Chen plays Princess Yuxuan, and Mei plays Su Wu. When the reporter met director Bu, he asked him, "Chen Yunshang has starred in five plays in Shanghai: "Mulan Joins the Army," "Yunshang Four Sons," "A Night as Empress," "Fei Zhen'e," and "Qin Liangyu." The male lead was Mei Xi in two of them (one of which, "A Night as Empress," Bu was a consultant for). This time, "Su Wu Shepherding Sheep" is the old lineup of the three of you working together. Is this a coincidence, or is there some intention behind it?" Bu said with a smile, "Perhaps Mei Xi is more suitable for the personality of the character in the play, so we asked him to take on the role. For example, he is sure to be suitable for playing Su Wu. Secondly, because everyone is used to working together, the work can be smoother." This is probably what he said about the difficult interpersonal relationships, and he used partners he was used to working with to avoid unexpected troubles.

Qilin Tong Zhang Yipeng
--Will Collaborate on a Play by Haixing

The Carlton Theatre plans to invite Zhang Yipeng and other famous actors in Shanghai who are currently idle, such as Wang Xichun and Yu Sulian, to jointly perform two charity plays, and also invites amateur performers to participate. It is decided that Qilin Tong must wear a white beard and armor, and Zhang Yipeng must also wear armor, similar to the old play "Yangping Pass." Yipeng has not performed in a long time, and many people miss his art. If he can participate this time, the appeal will be great. It is said that the highest ticket price is five yuan. This is a charity play to help the compatriots in Shaoxing who have been affected by the disaster, and the date is at the end of this month or the beginning of next month, that is, the eve of the premiere of "Wen Su Chen."

Short News

Xue Hongchang and Xiao Sili of the Lide Society and Miss Hao Xue, daughter of Mr. Li Ziyu, were married on the 15th at the Xindu Hotel on the 6th floor. It is said that there was a grand party, such as Sun Yixiang's Fortune Society's Yunhuan Set Mountain to Steal Horses, Xiao Shui's Shen Yongliang, etc.'s Zhulian Mountain Jie Bao Receives Prestige, and Yan Shishan's Yang Paifeng, etc. Mr. Xue is a pioneer in the transportation industry with a well-established reputation. At that time, there will be a lot of traffic and a grand occasion.

Twenty Kinds of Ballads by Wen Xiuyan, illustrated

(4) Three Smiles

"Three Smiles" is the most lighthearted ballad, performing throughout in a comedic style, without any changes of joy and sorrow. It tells the story of Tang Bohu's romantic adventures, from falling in love at first sight and chasing a boat to disguising himself and selling himself, to designing to point at Qiuxiang and bringing her back to Suzhou. In the middle, it intersperses some anecdotes about the three friends Wen, Zhu, and Zhou, and the "two bastards of the Hua family."

Some people complain for Tang Yin, saying that he was cautious throughout his life and never had these romantic and lewd affairs! In fact, "novels" are not "official history." Most of them are just rumors. If you have to verify each one, it would be too anticlimactic!

Former Germany Already Surveyed Norway's Terrain

The storms of the European War have suddenly shifted into Northern Europe. The people of these small countries, who could have lived peacefully, have suffered greatly as innocent bystanders. Before April 4, Germany had sent its Minister of War to survey Norway, so the Germans were already very familiar with Norway's terrain. The following is a translation of a section from the article "Arctic War" in The Digest on July 31, 1937:

"Marshal Von Blomberg, the German Minister of War, made a surprising inspection trip along Norway's northernmost coast last October. Although Norway's Oslo Evening Post is a well-known newspaper that favors Germany, it did not hesitate to say that at that time, this expedition had only one meaning: to find a strong base in the Arctic for German military operations." It can be seen that Germany's plot to seize Norway had long been planned.

A Brief Overview of the National Conditions of the Three Nordic Countries

Denmark

Capital Copenhagen

Area 16,575 square miles Population 3,777,000 (estimated in 1938)

Denmark is located on the Jutland Peninsula. Its land borders only with Germany. The rest juts north into the sea, with the Baltic Sea to the east and the North Sea to the west. It is separated from Norway by the Skagerrak Strait and faces Sweden across the Kattegat Strait. The entire country is formed by low-lying plains.

The Faroe Islands in the North Atlantic, about 300 miles from Shetland, belong to Denmark.

The capital, Copenhagen, is located on the island of Zealand in the east. In ancient times, there were scattered fishing villages, but its true builder is generally considered to be Archbishop Absalon (1128-1201). He established a strong fortress here to defend against pirates, and its ruins are now underground.

Norway is located in western Europe, occupying the western part of the Scandinavian Peninsula. It is separated from Denmark to the south by the Skagerrak Strait. To the north, it reaches North Cape in the Arctic Ocean and borders Finland. To the east, it is bounded by the Kjolen Mountains and Sweden. This leaves Norway with only a narrow strip of land in the north, and the coastline is shaped by the currents of the Arctic Ocean and the North Atlantic, forming spectacular fjords. The climate along the west coast is mild and humid, but the inland and northern regions are cold and dry.

Farmland Norway has only 4,300 square miles of cultivated land. Rivers and lakes occupy 5,000 square miles. Forests cover 27,500 square miles. Three-quarters of the country is unproductive. Norway is primarily a shipping nation. In 1939, it had a total of 4,833,813 tons of merchant ships, ranking fourth in the world.

In addition, the catch of whales, walruses, seals, mackerel, and salmon is also very large. There are mines of silver, copper, pyrite, nickel, iron, zinc, and lead, so mining is also very prosperous.

Norway lacks coal, but is rich in natural power - hydropower. According to a 1938 estimate, there are about 9,907,000,000 kilowatt-hours, so the utilization of electricity is very advanced.

The main manufactured products are food, metal products and machinery, paper and wood pulp, cloth, timber, oil and fertilizer.

The Lutheran church is the state-supported religion, and pastors are appointed by the King. Other religions also enjoy freedom.

Children aged seven to fourteen are required to attend compulsory education. The school system is well-organized. Illiteracy is almost non-existent. Oslo University, founded in 1811, is supervised by the state.

Political System According to the constitution of May 17, 1814, Norway is a hereditary monarchy. Norway was an independent kingdom for centuries before it was united with Denmark in 1381 to form a kingdom. On January 14, 1814, Denmark signed a treaty with Sweden, ceding Norway to Sweden. Norway then declared independence and elected a Danish prince as king. The countries did not recognize this, and the result of the meeting on August 14 decided that Norway would be independent and form a union with Sweden. On November 13, King Charles XIII of Sweden was elected King of Norway. In 1905, the union broke down because Norway fought for the right to establish its own consulates abroad. On June 7, Norway announced the dissolution of the union, and on October 26, an agreement was reached to dissolve the union. Norway held a national referendum and elected Danish Prince Charles as king, calling him Haakon VII. (He is the brother of the current Danish king).
