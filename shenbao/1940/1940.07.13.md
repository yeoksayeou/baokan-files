Tokyo - Today, a Foreign Ministry spokesperson stated that the UK and Japan have not yet begun any formal negotiations. However, Japan hopes that after the clouds currently shrouding them dissipate, relations between the two countries will improve. When a reporter asked if there were any differences in the translations of the statements made by the US and Japan regarding the Dutch East Indies, the spokesperson replied that although both Tokyo and Washington have issued statements regarding maintaining the status quo of the Dutch East Indies, the US and Japan have never directly discussed this issue, so it is not appropriate to comment. Someone also asked about news reports that Britain had requested the US government to pool British resources with those of the Western Hemisphere to prevent raw materials from falling into the hands of Italy, Germany, Japan, and others considered unfriendly to London. The spokesperson replied that this issue was very important and declined to comment further. Finally, the spokesperson also relayed that there are still many unresolved issues in Japanese-Soviet relations, and the Japanese ambassador to the Soviet Union has presented them one by one for resolution.

London - Well-informed sources here reported last night that the British government will soon instruct its ambassador to Tokyo, Sir Robert Craigie, to "soften further" its response to Japan's demand to close the Yunnan-Burma Road. After Japanese Ambassador to London Mamoru Shigemitsu met with British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax, reiterating Japan's demands, Britain seems to be adopting a more appropriate policy towards Japan. It is heard that the Japanese ambassador warned Halifax that Britain's strong stance on this issue would strengthen the measures of radical elements in Tokyo, who advocate closer relations between Japan and the Rome-Berlin Axis. Last week, Britain rejected Japan's demand to block traffic on the Yunnan-Burma Road, which caused anti-British sentiment in the Japanese press. Japanese Foreign Minister Arita requested the British government last Monday to reconsider its response. The reply to this request has not yet been submitted to Tokyo. (United Press, 12th)

Tokyo - British Ambassador to Japan Sir Robert Craigie held further talks with Foreign Minister Arita on the Yunnan-Burma Road transportation issue this afternoon, which lasted for two hours. According to a Foreign Ministry spokesperson, the talks have made satisfactory progress, and it is hoped that a more detailed statement can be released in a short time. (Havas, 12th)

Hong Kong - Japanese Consul-General in Hong Kong, Okazaki, told reporters yesterday that he had received a copy of the demands made by the Japanese government to the British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, but his position prevented him from discussing its contents. This matter is being handled by the British and Japanese governments. According to the English-language China Mail published in Hong Kong, there are three points of contention between Britain and Japan: (1) to prohibit all supplies from being transported to Chongqing, (2) to stop anti-Japanese propaganda in Hong Kong, and (3) to close Chinese political organizations in Hong Kong. It is reported that the Hong Kong government is currently considering this matter, and negotiations are progressing smoothly. (Reuters, 12th)

Japan Decides to Send Additional Inspectors

Tokyo - The Naval Department of the Imperial Headquarters issued a communiqué stating that it will send another group of inspectors to Guangzhouwan, a French leased territory. It is said that the Japanese Navy has decided to dispatch over ten inspectors, led by Captain Maruyama, to Guangzhouwan to observe the French cessation of all aid materials being transported to General Chiang Kai-shek through that area. Guangzhouwan is a narrow strip of coastal territory in Guangdong Province, including the islands of Donghai and Nanzhou (both transliterated), with a total population of 250,000, including over two hundred French nationals. It was leased to France under a treaty signed on November 16, 1898, for a term of 99 years. Previously, due to the increasing blockade of China's coast, the Chongqing government shifted its attention to Vietnam and Guangzhouwan as supply routes. (Reuters, 12th)

Tokyo - The Japanese Naval Ministry recently announced that it has dispatched twelve inspectors to Guangzhouwan to monitor the transport of goods to Chongqing. The French authorities in Guangzhouwan have apparently reached an understanding with the Japanese, similar to a Franco-Japanese agreement. (United Press, 12th)

Hong Kong - News today indicates that a French airline passenger plane carrying multiple Japanese inspectors to Indochina crashed near Baya Bao last week. Before the plane was destroyed, the air crew sent a wireless message stating, "Violent storm approaching, I am abandoning the aircraft." After these words were heard, the plane's radio immediately cut off. In addition to the Japanese inspectors, the plane also carried one French national residing in Hong Kong. The details of the accident are not yet known. (United Press, 12th)

### Military Affairs Commission Spokesperson Discusses Widespread Defection of Puppet Troops; Over 20,000 Puppet Troops in Eastern Henan Pledge Allegiance; Chinese Army Annihilates Many Japanese Troops; Laying the Foundation for Victory in the War of Resistance

Chongqing - In the past week, the war situation in various places has mostly been in a stalemate, but the defection of puppet troops has been widespread, like bamboo shoots after rain. Their battle achievements are truly astonishing. According to a military spokesperson speaking to a Central News Agency reporter, this puppet army defection movement is sweeping and large-scale, showing that people are thinking of the Han people and that victory in the War of Resistance is imminent. This not only completely shatters the Japanese dream of using Chinese to control Chinese, but also lays the foundation for China's final victory. A brief description of the puppet army's defection in various places is as follows: On the 31st of last month, the Chinese army launched a fierce attack into the city of Kaifeng. That night, in addition to annihilating more than 2,000 Japanese, they also destroyed more than ten bunkers and occupied the puppet police station, the Kempeitai, and special service agencies, destroying more than 30 vehicles. At that time, the three divisions of the puppet army in eastern Henan under Chen Jie (formerly Zhang Lanfeng), including Song Kebin, Cao Dazhong, and Li Zhongyi, with a total of more than 20,000 people and guns, took the opportunity to defect and assist the national army, attacking Bo County, Luyi, Shangqiu, and other places in various directions, killing thousands of Japanese and capturing many Japanese officers. Another unit fiercely attacked Yucheng, annihilating more than 300 Japanese soldiers and capturing eight artillery pieces, eleven light and heavy machine guns, more than 140 rifles, and more than 100,000 rounds of ammunition. Zhang's unit was the largest and most powerful part of the Japanese puppet army. The sudden defection caused great panic among the Japanese. At the same time, the puppet army under Wang Shouyin in Suixian County, taking advantage of the national army's attack on the Japanese outposts of Ma'anshan and Maping, surrendered one after another, attacking the city from both inside and outside. The Japanese inside the city suffered heavy losses. It is also heard that the puppet army in Suiyuan and Mongolia is also wavering. (11th)

Editorial

### From the Current Situation of Industry and Commerce to Plan for the Future

In these two or three months, the Shanghai market has been extremely turbulent, with extreme ups and downs. Foreign exchange went from tight to plentiful, and the price of gold (per ten taels) fell from more than 7,000 yuan to just over 5,000 yuan. 20-count cotton yarn fell from over 1,800 yuan per bale to as low as about 800 yuan, and along with cotton yarn, raw cotton and finished cotton cloth also fell. This has dealt a very serious blow to the industrial and commercial sectors and general speculators. It is also heard that the New York stock market suffered a severe slump, with Chinese magnates suffering huge losses. The Shanghai foreign stock market has seen prices fall steadily. Those who valued foreign stocks as treasures have now lost everything, yet it is still not enough to make up for their heavy losses. Only rice, wheat flour, fish, meat, vegetables, oil, and sauce, which are indispensable for life, have remained stable and even risen. Since money flows constantly, coming and going indefinitely, and the money earned by labor and sweat cannot always be protected, how can the gains from speculation and ill-gotten gains be? The ancient saying that ill-gotten gains are ill-spent is clearly true. Therefore, their successes and failures are not worth mentioning or worrying about. What is truly heartbreaking is that every time the market goes through a storm, the vitality of the people is further diminished.

The cause of the storm is said to be the result of white-hot speculation, which is certainly true. However, the complexity of the international situation and the world economy is also an important factor, which cannot be denied. Since the winds of change in Europe and the West have had far-reaching impacts, Shanghai's concessions have been filled with rumors, and industrial and commercial operators have been at a loss. Therefore, they have waited and watched, resulting in invisible stagnation. This cannot all be blamed on speculators. As the Japanese took the opportunity to put pressure on British and French territories in the Far East, the French first succumbed, and all areas bordering the interior of Vietnam and Guangzhouwan were blockaded. The Chinese sections along Hong Kong were also occupied by the Japanese army. As a result, the southwestern roads lost their agility and convenience, which directly dealt a major blow to Shanghai's industry and commerce. At the same time, the deterioration of relations between Britain and France meant that shipping between the two countries' territories in the Far East was in danger of being interrupted. Industrial and commercial circles had no confidence in what cargo transport in Southeast Asia would be like in the future. As for the commerce between northern China and the southern and central regions, which were originally one family, they are now different races. Since June 26, the Japanese have reduced the scope and strengthened control over remittances and commercial goods between North China and other places. In the south and central regions, they have also imposed various restrictions on goods transported from the north. Therefore, commerce in the occupied areas of northern and southern China will inevitably suffer a sharp decline due to fragmentation. What will take its place is Japanese goods. This is the inevitable consequence of a harsh and meticulous squeeze policy.

In addition, the constant rise in prices has invisibly reduced general purchasing power. This can be clearly seen in the attempts to cut prices that have not helped to alleviate the deserted business. Merchants, burdened by accumulated difficulties and yearning for last year's windfall profits, failed to understand the changes in the situation and intended to hoard more goods in order to obtain huge profits. Unexpectedly, they achieved the opposite and suffered huge losses. Raw materials for industry, such as cotton, wheat, and silkworm cocoons, have also been swept up by the Japanese in the name of "control," with the prices being searched and collected into their own pockets for use in their factories. Even if Chinese factory owners offer high prices, it is not easy to obtain them. The result is that Chinese-owned factories will either close down or submit, seeking a share of the remaining profits through the "cooperation" technique. We can only use expensive foreign exchange to obtain raw materials from overseas. Since the cost is high, how can we compete in the market? On the other hand, sales of bulk export goods such as silk and tea have declined sharply in Europe and Africa, regardless of the decline in tea prices at the production sites. When new silkworm cocoons were released, each picul could be sold for around 200 yuan, but now, with silk sales sluggish and factory silk burdened with heavy donations and taxes, exports are greatly hindered. Native silk in western Zhejiang is sold for 70 or 80 yuan, but there are still few buyers. Rice and grain are for domestic consumption only, so there is no worry about insufficient supply. However, in addition to using war to support war, the Japanese grain merchants in the occupied areas often pay the price of two piculs for only one picul of rice and grain, and there is still the difficulty of transportation, so they have to rely on Vietnam and Siam. Recently, there are also concerns that rice shipped from Hong Kong will be blockaded once it is, so foreign rice is arriving in an endless stream. Vietnamese rice, due to the Mediterranean war, has no way to be shipped west to supply France and Italy. This seems to offer some hope of alleviating the panic of rice shortages in Shanghai, but it is widely heard that the Japanese have already made plans to monopolize it, and the future is uncertain.

All of this has a diminishing impact on Shanghai's industry and commerce, day by day. How should those in the industry be vigilant as soon as possible!

### President Chiang's Closing Remarks at the Seventh Plenary Session: Facing the Changing International Environment with a Spirit of Self-Improvement; Japan's So-Called East Asian Monroe Doctrine Cannot Justify Itself

Chongqing: The Seventh Plenary Session concluded on the afternoon of July 8th. President Chiang personally delivered the closing remarks, elaborating in great detail on the recent international environment and the efforts of party members and the people. The full text has been finalized, and a brief summary is as follows:

Fellow comrades, the Seventh Plenary Session has now concluded, and we are holding the closing ceremony. For the past eight days, despite the intense heat and the bombing raids by Japanese aircraft, all of you have worked hard and diligently, without fearing hardship or danger, allowing this session to achieve a successful outcome. I firmly believe that if we maintain this spirit and continue to strive forward, there is no difficulty that we cannot overcome. I am even more confident that our revolutionary cause of resistance and nation-building will be completed as scheduled. This time, the number of comrades attending was particularly enthusiastic, the session was relatively long, and the number of resolutions passed was also particularly high. In addition to the daily plenary sessions, the various review committees were also particularly careful and diligent. The comrades devoted their entire time each day to the session, and all proposals were carefully discussed by everyone with concentrated effort, resulting in concrete resolutions. It can be said that the spirit and achievements of this session surpass all previous plenary sessions. All of our resolutions will be implemented in the future with this spirit, seeking practical results. The will of the session has been expressed in the declaration and does not need to be repeated. Today, on the occasion of the closing, I would like to share a few important points with you. First, I must explain that the environment in which we are now resisting the war, both before and during our session, has seen extraordinary and drastic changes in the international situation. Recently, Japan's words and actions in the Pacific have become increasingly嚣张 and bizarre. All of you comrades have paid particular attention to international issues this time, so I would like to further elaborate on this during the closing. In my opinion, no matter how the international environment evolves, the most important thing is that we ourselves have a solid foundation of perseverance, unyielding spirit, and self-improvement. If we have a strong foundation, then no matter how the international situation changes, it will only benefit our country and will not have any disadvantages. The spirit of our revolutionary resistance has always been to be diligent and courageous, and to persevere to the end, and we must not be affected in the slightest by whether the international environment is favorable or unfavorable. Moreover, the current international environment is particularly favorable to us, approaching our expected direction step by step, and even more in line with our goals of struggle. Now, I will cite a recent example to illustrate this to you comrades. What I want to talk about is Japan's high-profile advocacy of "East Asia's Autonomy" at the end of last month, as well as the recent remarks by the US President's secretary regarding

the Monroe Doctrine. In order to carry out its traditional aggressive policy of conquering China in order to conquer the world, as stated in the Tanaka Memorial, Japan's consistent tactic has been to use existing terms in the world as a defense to cover up its actions. Since the "September 18th Incident," the Japanese government and public have often chanted the slogan "East Asia for East Asians," and the term "East Asian Monroe Doctrine" has appeared in their public and private propaganda texts. Their intention is nothing more than to exclude Europe and the United States to avoid obstacles to their invasion of China and plunder of Asia, especially targeting the United States, which advocates the "Non-Recognition Doctrine" and "Upholds the Nine-Power Treaty." In their view, the Americas have the Monroe Doctrine, so why can't East Asia be subject to the Monroe Doctrine by Japan? After the recent dramatic changes in Europe, it has肆行 threats in the Dutch East Indies, Vietnam, Nanyang and other places, revealing its锋芒. Since the second half of last month, it has been loudly proclaiming that its government will have a major statement on the "East Asian Monroe Doctrine." Finally, on June 29th, after its Round Table Conference, its Foreign Minister Arita made an informal broadcast, claiming to be the master of East Asia, wanting to include China and Nanyang lands as his "fields based on co-existence,"儼然称自己为「东亚安定势力之日本」," and on the one hand saying that this kind of thought also exists in European and American countries. When we look at his full text, it is really absurd, hoping to敷衍 and threaten the eyes and ears of the world, and opposing, hoping to realize the "East Asian New Order" that everyone厭聞 and惡聞 by changing its name. He doesn't think at all about what kind of environment the so-called Monroe Doctrine was produced in, what era it was in, and what its essence is. To be honest, the Americas have the Monroe Doctrine, and it happened

more than a hundred years ago, and there was the environment of the Americas at that time, so such a doctrine could be produced. Also, because there is a country like the United States that has leadership qualifications and is willing to coexist in equality, mutual assistance and peace with the countries of this continent, the Monroe Doctrine can be promoted for a long time. What era is it now, and what country is Japan? Especially, what is the current environment and geographical situation of Asia? Regardless of the most important factors such as history, culture, population and ethnicity, he ignores them all, thinking that the Monroe Doctrine can be produced casually. He doesn't know that the reason why the United States can achieve the Monroe Doctrine is because the spirit of the Monroe Doctrine is needed by the independent and free countries of the Americas in mutual assistance and self-defense, and it is definitely not the result of military aggression. Moreover, today, in order to truly establish world peace forever, we should have exceeded the regional or partial combination and expanded it into a truly equal, reasonable and effective collective security organization to achieve permanent results. As far as Asia is concerned, only China, with the most ancient culture, the largest population, the largest area, and the closest historical relationship with the various ethnic groups in Asia, can stabilize Asia with its inherent morality and the Three People's Principles, and cooperate with various countries to contribute to the peace of Asia and the world. What qualifications does Japan have today

to talk about "East Asian Autonomy" or even the "East Asian Monroe Doctrine"? You must know that Asia is different from other continents. Asia has its own independent culture, and it also has intricate and close regional relations with various countries in the world. When we mention Asia, we cannot forget that the northern part has Soviet Russia, which spans Europe and Asia. Moreover, due to the relations in various places on the Pacific and Indian Oceans, Asia is not only related to Europe, but also to both the eastern and western hemispheres. Now Japan still俨然 considers itself the ruler of Asia. I will not talk about the foundation of culture and morality for the time being, but just in terms of military force, I really don't know if he has estimated his own strength, and I don't know if he has考憲了 the facts. What exactly does he rely on to chant the Asian Monroe Doctrine? Following the broadcast by the Japanese Foreign Minister, what has attracted general attention is the remarks made by US President's Secretary Olly on July 6. Because the initial telegrams conveyed that in his speech there was a sentence "What the US government hopes and believes should be realized is that all continents adopt the Monroe Doctrine," so short-sighted Japanese thought that his statement had been echoed. In fact, according to his original intention, it was "The US government is willing to see Europe and Asia each adopt the Monroe Doctrine, and the interpretation and application of this Monroe Doctrine are the same as those

practiced in the Americas," that is to say, it should be based on mutual assistance, self-defense, equality and independence. When we look at the full text of his speech, the main purpose is to explain how to deal with the issue of the territories in the Americas of the defeated countries in the European war. As for the Asian issue, his true intention is clearly to oppose Japan's method of oppressing various countries by force, and to oppose Japan's actions of invading and estimating any place by force. Especially for French Annam, he clearly pointed out that "it should be resolved by the countries of East Asia through collective consultation." In simple terms, this sentence means that the United States absolutely opposes Japan using force to invade Annam's freedom and unilaterally dispose of Annam. It can be seen that he has never recognized that Japan will use force alone to dominate Annam and decide its fate. Our general comrades must know that the United States cannot abandon its traditional policy in the Far East and its consistent stand. Moreover, only the United States, which strengthens its consistent主張, is the initiator of the "Nine-Power Treaty." His consistent主張 of respecting the independence of various countries and opening the doors to the Far East is his opposition to Japan's military aggression, opposition to Japan's exclusive dominance, and opposition to Japan's closed-door斗戶. The most important reason is that the United States has been expanding its military power recently and is unusually active. Military expenditure has been increased time and time again. Why is it necessary to expand the military again and again? Of course, it is not only for the Atlantic Ocean, but also to take into account the security of its safety bảo trận and the power of speech on the Pacific Ocean. In terms of the historical relationship in the past, the United States is naturally more concerned about Europe than Asia, but from the perspective of its reality and future establishment, it must attach more importance to Asia than Europe.

### US Congress Declares Recess; Passes Bipartisan Appropriations Bill and Military Law; To Build a Vast Navy in Four Years; Expected to Surpass the Combined Strength of Britain and Japan

Washington: The House of Representatives yesterday passed the bipartisan naval bill worth $4 billion. At this point, the bill has been formally established. This move will allow the United States to build a vast navy in four years. The bill has been immediately sent to President Roosevelt, and it is expected that he will sign it today so that the construction of 200 new battleships can begin as soon as possible. This bill will make the US Navy larger than the combined navies of Britain and Japan today. After this, the United States will have 800 battleships. At the same time, the Navy Department announced that if Congress can accept President Roosevelt's request again and pass another $4 billion military proposal, the defense of the US Pacific will be more substantial. The request was made by President Roosevelt to Congress in writing on Wednesday, and he also guaranteed that the United States' "self-defense mechanism will be stronger than ever." The Navy Department said that the defense funds that the President recently requested from Congress will be quickly passed by Congress. Regarding the distribution of the funds, $350 million will be used to establish a naval station and naval hospital in Guam, 1,200 miles southeast of Yokohama. The bill also includes $10,699,000 to supplement the defense of Hawaii, including a new naval air station, and $400,000 to establish a naval air station on Midway Island. Another $180,000 will be used to build a new naval airfield on Tutuila Island. The bill also allocates funds to strengthen the US defense in the Caribbean. The largest amount used in this area will be the naval air base in Saint John, worth $3.175 million. The total amount used for naval bases in the Caribbean is $6.056 million. Congress also received a request urging to find ways to develop mobile anti-aircraft batteries, motor torpedo boats, mines, and long-range coastal defense guns, and to have them supervised by experts. Dr. Mead, an expert from President Roosevelt's Civil Defense Committee, announced that he had heard that countless contracts had been considered to rush to build 25,000 aircraft for the army and navy within two years. Since President Roosevelt decided to submit another $4,848,171,000 defense plan on Wednesday, the executive department's rearmament plan has reached $14 billion. President Roosevelt told Congress, "If the United States needs national defense, it must be a complete national defense." The President also said, "We will not let anyone believe that the United States is a weak country." (United Press, 11th)

### It is Reported That the Axis Powers Encourage Japan to Join the War; Japan Continues to Use Empty Threats Against France, Britain, and the United States; Military Experts Observe That Japan Cannot Afford to Take Risks

Washington: The US government is indeed hoping that the current difficulties in Shanghai can be resolved peacefully on the spot. Officials here are carefully refraining from making statements that could worsen the situation. However, everyone knows that anti-American clamor has been intentionally stirred up. According to reliable information here, Germany is extremely active in Tokyo's diplomatic circles, doing everything possible to蛊惑, wanting Japan to join the Axis powers in the war in order to困擾 Britain and seize any or all of the territories of Britain, France, and the Netherlands in the Pacific region. People here expect Berlin to intend to let Japan keep the land it has seized as a result, and Tokyo seems to know this. According to news from diplomatic circles, Japan has been very careful in handling matters so far. What it has done is only to see how it can make France, Britain, and the United States give in under its empty threats. Now that France has succumbed to Nazi rule, Japan's empty threats against the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway have been successful. However, its threats against the Yunnan-Burma Road have failed to intimidate Britain. Now it wants to test the mood of the United States in Shanghai. Washington is now deeply interested in watching Japan's subsequent actions, because it expects that Japan's empty threats against Britain and the United States will all fail. The German fleet is still berthed in domestic ports, and the Italian fleet has also avoided war. Therefore, there are very few signs of the US battle fleet sailing away from the vicinity of Hawaii. According to military experts, if the Japanese navy risks trying to逞 in the Dutch East Indies or Malaya, it will see that a stronger fleet is stationed between its risky land and its far-away domestic base, and at least it will feel inconvenient. The American flag is still fluttering on the Philippine Islands, which it must defend. In addition, the US State Department has clarified that the Monroe Doctrine's remarks made by President Roosevelt's secretary at the end of last week are remarks made on policy, and the remarks made by Secretary of State Hull last Friday are indeed the policy of the United States. Check Hull's statement that the United States has not changed its stance, and it cannot tolerate the transfer of Western Hemisphere territory from one European country to another. The Monroe Doctrine has nothing to do with the fact that several European countries own territory in the Americas while other countries do not. The Monroe Doctrine is purely a policy of self-defense, intended to maintain the independence and integrity of the countries of the Americas. (Reuters, 11th)

Tokyo: Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman Suma Yakichiro recently told the press that Japan is still willing to adjust its relations with the United States in order to clear the clouds over the relations between the two countries. He also said that when the United States abolished the US-Japan Commercial Treaty signed in 1911 last summer, the United States already knew that Japan was very willing to adjust its relations with the United States, because at that time "our cards were placed on the table." Suma said that Japan expressed its willingness to adjust relations with the United States and conclude a new commercial treaty at that time. However, Suma also said that there are currently no negotiations underway here to improve US-Japan relations. When asked whether the United States and Japan have conflicting views on the issue of maintaining the status quo of the Dutch East Indies, Suma said that the two countries have never directly discussed this issue, and it would be reckless to make any comments.

### Adopting Low-Altitude Bombing Tactics, German Air Raids on Britain Intensify; Twenty-Three Aircraft Shot Down in Two Days; British Prime Minister Inspects Defense and Nearly Meets an Accident

London: The German air raids have intensified, and yesterday they even carried out large-scale killings and destruction in Britain. King George and Prime Minister Churchill also nearly met an accident, and were spared from bombs and machine gun bullets. In the previous twenty-five hours of air raids, twenty or thirty people were killed and hundreds were injured. Twenty-two German aircraft were shot down or damaged by British anti-aircraft guns and fighter jets. King George was inspecting the army in the eastern coastal area yesterday, and German aircraft were found in the sky at that time. During the air raid, the King and the British army did not have time to enter the air-raid shelter. Prime Minister Churchill was also inspecting coastal defenses yesterday, but when the German army bombed the defense zone, Wen immediately took refuge in the air-raid shelter. Now many German aircraft are using low-altitude bombing tactics, followed by intensive machine-gun扫射. Hundreds and thousands of shops, houses, government offices, and fields have been attacked and damaged by this new tactic. Yesterday, German aircraft frantically destroyed day and night. A certain town on the southeast coast, after many决's fierce bombing, has turned the prosperous trading area into a slaughterhouse. The personnel in charge of rescue work were excavating瓦砾 in the destroyed areas last night and this morning to find the bodies of the victims. It is generally believed that as a result of yesterday's air raid, the rate of casualties will inevitably increase significantly. After yesterday's large-scale air raid, a single German aircraft dropped eight bombs in the residential area of the same town, but no one was bombed to death, and only a few people were concussed. This morning, a German aircraft in a town in the southwest dropped six bombs in a residential area, and the houses were greatly damaged, but there were no casualties. (United Press, 12th)

London: British fighter jets and anti-aircraft guns have shot down more than ten German aircraft attacking Britain every day for three consecutive days. By noon on Thursday, twelve had been shot down. It was later confirmed that eight more were shot down last night, and several more were shot down this morning. Among them, four bombers were shot down off the east coast. Reuters learned from responsible sources that British fighter jets and anti-aircraft guns shot down no fewer than twenty-three German aircraft in various parts of Britain in the past twenty-four hours. At the same time, British aircraft penetrated deep into the Ruhr area during the day to attack warehouses. Last night, British aircraft re-entered Germany to attack military targets. All the aircraft that attacked during the day flew back, and three bombers attacking at night were missing. (Reuters, 12th)

London: Twenty-four German aircraft flew over the southeastern coast of Britain last night and dropped fifteen high-explosive bombs. The public believed that four German aircraft were shot down at that time. When the German aircraft attacked, they briefly clashed with British aircraft and immediately turned around and flew into the sea. Finally, someone saw that the batch of German aircraft was being repeatedly attacked by British fighters. One German aircraft was shot down by anti-aircraft fire, and one of its crew members jumped out and parachuted into the sea. Also, seven German aircraft and Spitfire-style British aircraft engaged in combat over southeastern Britain. One enemy bomber crashed to the ground and was destroyed in a fire. Four crew members were rescued from the fire. The remaining German aircraft dropped three high-explosive bombs near the English Channel while being driven into the English Channel, all of which fell in the fields and were not damaged. Another two aircraft, believed to be German bombers, crashed into the sea about five miles away. After a town in the southeast was attacked, some civilians were killed and injured. One shell hit the emergency station, and the people in the station were bombed to death. Also, the hotel, bank and police station on the main street of a certain town were all destroyed, as if an earthquake had occurred. (Reuters, 12th)

London: An Air Ministry communique stated that yesterday a large fleet of enemy bombers, protected by fighter jets, encountered fierce resistance when they attacked ships and other targets around the British coast. British fighter jets shot down twelve enemy aircraft and engaged with many enemy aircraft. One British fighter jet was lost. A British coastal aircraft shot down an enemy seaplane while patrolling in the sky over the English Channel. In addition, British Air Force bombers attacked bombing airfields and concentrated ships and other targets in the Netherlands and Belgium yesterday. One British aircraft was missing. On Wednesday, British bombers 画袭ed the Saint-Omer and Amiens airfields in France, and five British aircraft did not return. A coastal aircraft was also lost on patrol. (Reuters, 12th)

London: The Air Ministry's Intelligence Department stated that British Air Force medium bombers attacked the Poix airfield in France at dawn. It is believed that five German aircraft have been destroyed and several others have been severely damaged. The ground defenses were caught off guard when the British aircraft突袭ed. Therefore, the anti-aircraft guns opened fire after the British aircraft dropped bombs and flew away. The first batch of British aircraft dropped several high-explosive bombs along one side of the airfield. Ten minutes later, twenty enemy aircraft parked behind the hangar were also attacked. (Reuters, 12th)

### British Foreign Secretary Reports on the Near East Situation in the House of Lords, States British Naval Power in the Mediterranean is Strong, Able to Fulfill Promises to Allied Nations

London - British Foreign Secretary Halifax stated in the House of Lords yesterday regarding the situation in the Near East that since Italy's entry into the war, Britain has never pressured Egypt to declare war on Italy. However, at the request of the Egyptian government, British troops stationed in Egypt have been greatly increased to prevent Italian aggression against Egypt. Britain intends to fulfill its obligation to protect Egypt. Egypt's independence and vital interests have been threatened by Italy's declaration of war on Britain. He was pleased to inform that the Egyptian people deeply understand that British and Egyptian interests are intertwined and inseparable, so they are suspicious of Italy's sweet words and are aware of the possibility of Italy invading Egyptian and Sudanese territory. Moreover, Italy's actions in Libya, Albania, and Abyssinia have not been forgotten, and the ambitions of totalitarian states prevent them from having illusions. The Italian Minister to Cairo is delaying his departure, and the enemy is spreading rumors that if Egypt abandons its treaty obligations, it can avoid the calamity of Italian troops pressing the border. Many responsible Egyptians believe that in these troubled times, for the benefit of the Egyptian people, there must be a stronger government to demonstrate its determination to fulfill treaty obligations. The British government, bearing the responsibility of protecting Egypt, also stated that Britain's opinion coincides with this. The situation in Palestine remains calm. Apart from occasional banditry, the whole territory is generally peaceful. The release of a large number of Arabs from prison is welcomed. People of all factions have strengthened their pro-British sentiments after Italy's entry into the war. While the Jews are fully cooperating with the British authorities in defense and emergency plans, the Arabs fear that Italy's colonization methods used in Libya will be applied to Palestine in the future, so they are also providing consistent cooperation to the British authorities.

Britain and Turkey still maintain very close ties. At the beginning of Italy's entry into the war, the Turkish Council of Ministers declared that Turkey would maintain a non-belligerent attitude. The British government deeply understands the circumstances under which the Turkish government made this decision, and the Turkish government has always maintained close contact with the British government. The Anglo-Turkish Treaty is still valid, and the loyal friendship and sympathy between the two peoples on which this treaty is based still exists. He hopes that this can be the basis for constructive cooperation between the two countries during the current war and in future peace. Although Germany is making every effort in the Balkans and the Near East to arouse unfounded doubts and fears, in the hope that countries will fall for its cunning schemes, he believes that the people there have plenty of experience with the methods of totalitarian states and will not be deceived into changing their belief in the principles for which we are striving. We now state that we have the ability to provide assistance and protection to our friends in the Near East and the Balkans. (Reuters, 12th)

### France Implements Dictatorial Political System, Marshal Pétain Appointed as Head of State, Administrative Power Concentrated in One Person, Government to Move to Versailles

Vichy - The French government issued a decree last night, announcing Marshal Pétain as the Supreme Commander of France, bestowing upon him the title of "Head of the French State," and concurrently exercising the powers of the President and the Prime Minister. From now on, the administrative power of the French government will be completely concentrated in Marshal Pétain. All ministries will be responsible to Marshal Pétain and directly under his command. Marshal Pétain's authority can now independently cope with tense foreign situations and handle serious domestic conflicts. The Senate and the Chamber of Deputies will adjourn as soon as the new constitution is officially promulgated. In the future, only the Head of State can convene the two houses to meet. (Haitong News Agency, 12th)

London - Swiss radio station Bollomminster said that Marshal Pétain had just signed an order to take over all the work previously handled by the President and Prime Minister of the Republic. Therefore, Lebrun, who had been President and head of France since 1933, was dismissed by Marshal Pétain. President Pétain also signed an order stipulating the powers of the head of state, which he will exercise in full cooperation with the government and various ministers and central administrators. (Reuters, 12th)

New Constitution Stipulates the Powers of the Head of State

Vichy - Today's French government gazette published the new French constitution, stipulating the powers of the French Head of State as follows:

"Article 1" The great power of the government is entirely in the hands of the French Head of State. The Head of State appoints ministers, who are only responsible to the Head of State. (1) Before the new parliament is established, the Head of State exercises legislative power in the cabinet. (2) After the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies are established, in times of internal and external trouble and crises, the Head of State has the power to issue decrees regarding financial budgets and taxation. (3) The Head of State promulgates laws and regulations for implementation. (4) The Head of State appoints civil and military officials. (5) The Head of State controls the supreme military power of the country. (6) The Head of State exercises the power of amnesty. (7) The Head of State has the power to conduct diplomatic negotiations, approve treaties, and receive foreign envoys. (8) The Head of State has the power to declare martial law nationwide, or in part. (9) The Head of State has the power to declare war with the approval of parliament.

"Article 2" The French Constitution promulgated on February 25, 1875, and the French Constitution promulgated on July 16, 1875, are hereby repealed to the extent that they conflict with the new constitution. Signed by Pétain in Vichy on July 11, 1940. (Haitong News Agency, 12th)

Pétain Delivers a Radio Address - Vichy - Marshal Pétain delivered a speech to the people on the radio last night, hinting at the enormous work that the government is currently facing. We only need to think about the refugees and supply problems in France and their scope. In the dark period when France was forced to yield to Germany, France's suffering continued. The British Navy has attacked the French Navy, its former ally. No matter what the reason, no justification can prove the rationality of this move. Britain claims that it had to take this measure to prevent the French fleet from falling into German and Italian hands. France has failed in this great war and has suffered new wounds. He needs the trust of all the French people, just as he has gained the trust of the French representatives. He will organize a new government. The administrative heads of the provinces should be changed to governors, appointed by the government. In view of the various matters to be dealt with, the French government has decided to move to Versailles, and the various cabinet departments will move back to Paris, that is, to the occupied territory. This request has now been submitted to the German government. This war has declared the collapse of international capitalism and international socialism. France has now broken away from all dark treaties and alliances and is completely isolated, but France will independently transform the French nation and French life with courage and fortitude. (Haitong News Agency, 12th)

Parliamentary System Barely Survives

Vichy - According to the impressions gained by the special correspondent of Haitong News Agency from talking with French parliamentarians, the French parliamentary system has not been overthrown. At the same time, French political parties do not intend to dissolve themselves. Both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies will continue to exist until new houses are produced in accordance with the new constitution, after which they will be dissolved. Although most of the French parliamentarians in Vichy have passed a resolution authorizing Prime Minister Pétain to draft a new constitution, they still hope that the two houses can participate in the drafting of the new constitution. The various political parties are also not prepared to dissolve themselves. Assistant Laval is currently advocating the organization of a single political party, but this proposal has been cancelled due to opposition from various parties. The younger parliamentarians generally do not believe that Pétain, Weygand, Laval, and Magne are figures who can revive France, so they collectively call them the "New Leaders."

### Naval Battle in the Mediterranean Underway, Italian Troops Launch a Large-Scale Offensive in East Africa, British Troops Surrounded in Moyale

Rome - Today's Italian military bulletin stated that the Anglo-Italian naval and air war in the Mediterranean, which began this week, is still ongoing today. Italian aircraft continued to bomb the vicinity of Malta, sinking one ship and destroying two destroyers. A British aircraft carrier was also burned by Italian air force bombing. (United Press, 12th)

London - Today, the Italian official bulletin broadcast by Rome Radio stated that when Italian aircraft attacked the British fleet in the Mediterranean, a large bomb hit an aircraft carrier, a ship in the convoy sank, and two destroyers were severely damaged. The bulletin also stated that Italian aircraft saw the aircraft carrier catch fire after being hit, and other ships went to rescue it. The attacked British fleet was said to consist of two battleships, one aircraft carrier, several smaller warships, and five large ships escorting fully loaded ships, sailing east near Malta. Officials in London have denied the above news. According to news received here, one Italian aircraft was shot down, and one British fighter plane could not fly again after landing. There were no other losses. (Reuters, 12th)

Nairobi - A British outpost in Moyale, on the border between Abyssinia and Kenya, was surrounded by a large number of Italian troops at dawn on Wednesday. However, it is still holding firm. The British side has dispatched troops to reinforce it. According to the communiqué, the Italian army has fired more than 1,000 shells at it, but so far there have been few casualties. The communiqué also stated that yesterday morning, three Italian Caproni bombers dropped many bombs in Moyale, causing very little damage. Three British aircraft took off to intercept them, shooting down one of them, and the engine of another was also seen to catch fire. All British aircraft safely returned to their bases. (Reuters, 12th)

### Britain Seeks to Improve Relations with the Soviet Union, Hope of Success Gradually Apparent, Butler Answers Questions from Parliamentarians

London - The Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Butler, was asked in the British House of Commons yesterday whether he could sincerely acknowledge the claim in the German White Paper that Britain intended to directly attack the Baku oil fields, and declare to the House of Commons that the British government's policy was to improve and consolidate Anglo-Soviet relations. Butler replied that the British government's policy had always been to improve and strengthen Anglo-Soviet relations. This policy had shown promise of success after March of this year, when the Soviet Union made friendly contacts with the British government, intending to resume trade negotiations. This was a welcome departure from the unfriendly attitude adopted by the Soviet Union after the breakdown of political negotiations in August of last year. The British government immediately agreed to it, and hopes that the discussions currently being conducted by the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Cripps, can ultimately eliminate the danger that some people fear, that the Soviet government will work for Germany economically and militarily to the detriment of Britain. Since the outbreak of the war, the British government has been preventing this danger when formulating military plans. The General Staff must of course consider how to respond to Soviet assistance to Germany. Apart from military assistance, the most valuable assistance that the Soviet Union could give to Germany would be to supply Germany with oil from the Caucasus. It is the responsibility of the General Staff to study whether, under certain circumstances, it is possible to interfere with the production of Caucasian oil. However, the British government has never sought the cooperation or tacit consent of Turkey or Iran in this hypothetical plan. He hopes that these remarks can dispel the false and harmful impressions that German propaganda seeks to create. (Reuters, 12th)

### Balkan Situation Tense, Turkey Takes Precautionary Measures, Prime Minister to Deliver Speech Clarifying Attitude Towards Europe, Soviet Union Denies Demands for Turkey to Cede Territory

Ankara - Turkish affairs took a sharp turn yesterday. The news that the military authorities in the Istanbul district summoned cavalry and soldiers on sick leave between the ages of twenty and thirty-eight from the 17th grade to return to their teams today had just spread, and the report that members of the People's Party (i.e., the ruling party) were summoned to a meeting at 10:00 yesterday morning followed. Yesterday afternoon, the gazette stated that Prime Minister Saydam reported on the situation and political events of the past few days. His speech was long, and the coalition party unanimously supported it. What was discussed at the meeting yesterday was clearly focused on Turkish-Soviet relations. Although political circles have not yet acknowledged the claim that the Soviet side submitted the Amedet letter, Turkish-Soviet relations now seem to be gradually crystallizing. The most notable is the Soviet Union's desire for its warships to be able to freely cross the Dardanelles Strait. Judging from recent newspaper propaganda, it would not be surprising if the Soviet Union wanted to amend the Montreux Convention, which grants Turkey the right to prohibit warships from crossing this strait. Turkey's attitude can be seen in the official declaration to be issued today. According to people here, the Axis powers seem to be trying to lure the Soviet Union to divert its attention from the Balkans and focus on Turkey and the Near East, so they are quite dissatisfied with Germany for interfering in Turkish affairs. Turkish newspapers are increasingly criticizing Germany's attempts to alienate Turkey and the Soviet Union. (Reuters, 12th)

Moscow - Recently, foreign newspapers have spread rumors that the Soviet Union has demanded that Turkey cede territory. TASS has recently been officially authorized to state that these rumors are pure fabrication and completely inconsistent with the facts. (TASS, 12th)

Ankara - The public is paying great attention to the declaration to be delivered by Prime Minister Saydam in the National Assembly this afternoon. It is expected that Saydam will declare that Turkey abhors the Axis powers' efforts to cause disputes between it and the Soviet Union. Although Turkey currently has no possibility of French assistance, it seems confident that it can resist all unfair demands and is determined to do so.

It is heard that Saydam's remarks will be delivered in strong and forceful terms and are likely to cause a deep impression abroad. As for the Soviet Union's official denial of Germany's claim that the Soviet Union sent the Amedet letter to the Turkish government, this has satisfied Turkey. British Foreign Secretary Halifax's remarks in the House of Lords on Wednesday night regarding Anglo-Turkish relations were also warmly welcomed here. German Ambassador to Turkey Papen has returned to Ankara to maintain contact with political developments. Turkey is now indignant at the conspiracies of the German diplomatic community, who have spread various rumors in the past week, such as the Soviet Union will make demands on Turkey, the Anglo-Turkish Treaty will be officially abolished, Turkey will ask for German protection, and Istanbul will be ceded to the Soviet Union. These rumors have aroused strong criticism from Turkish newspapers, and political circles are also indignant. Today's denial by the Soviet Union and Prime Minister Saydam's speech seem to make it clear to the general public, and even to German diplomats, that Germany's efforts to intimidate Turkey or to poison Soviet-Turkish relations have failed. (Reuters, 12th)

London - Foreign Secretary Halifax met with Soviet Ambassador Maisky yesterday to discuss the general situation. According to diplomatic sources here, the talks were quite "harmonious." The two sides exchanged views on the Balkan Peninsula, especially the issue of the Turkish Dardanelles Strait. On this issue, Ambassador Maisky did not seem to explain anything concretely, but judging from his general expression, it was quite reassuring. (Havas, 11th)

### Romanian Foreign Minister Announces Foreign Policy, Decides to Strengthen Political Relations with Germany, Romania and Bulgaria Begin Negotiations to Adjust Friendship

Bucharest - Romanian Foreign Minister Manolescu declared to press representatives yesterday that the redetermination of Romania's foreign policy will be proven by concrete facts. Romania's withdrawal from the League of Nations is the initial step in this new policy. Romania is determined to sever relations with the past. We are determined to strengthen political relations with Germany and create a new era of permanent friendly cooperation between Germany and Romania. (Haitong News Agency, 12th)

Sofia - Bulgarian political figures said yesterday that preliminary negotiations to adjust friendly relations between Bulgaria and Romania have now begun. Bulgarian figures believe that the new Romanian cabinet will be more understanding of Bulgaria's demands than its predecessor. The Gigurtu cabinet had expressed its intention to compromise on the issue of Dobruja. It is understood that the preliminary negotiations between Bulgaria and Romania have a high hope of ending satisfactorily, but the Bulgarian government has not yet confirmed that Bulgaria and Romania have begun negotiations. However, one thing to note is that Bulgarian newspapers have stopped publishing rebuttals of Romania since yesterday. (Haitong News Agency, 12th)

Sofia - Former Bulgarian Prime Minister Shaukov issued a booklet yesterday, solemnly declaring that Bulgaria should demand Dobruja and access to the Aegean Sea, and pointed out that this demand cannot be fulfilled without the sympathy and assistance of Germany. Shaukov also elaborated on the need for cooperation between the Soviet Union and Germany. Since Bulgaria is one of the small countries, its policies should be appropriate to the interests of the great powers. (Haitong News Agency, 12th)

Romanian Government Issues New Order to Control Oil Industry Stocks

Bucharest - The government has issued a new order to control the stocks of Romanian oil companies, stipulating that all shares must be registered within 30 days, and detailed information must be reported to the Minister of National Economy. Shares held overseas must be represented by diplomatic and consular personnel, specifying the date and place of purchase by the holders. In the future, the transfer of these shares cannot take effect without the permission of the Romanian Special Committee now established. Some parties believe that this order is the first step towards nationalization. (Reuters, 12th)

### Hungarian Prime Minister Publishes Impressions of Visiting Germany

Budapest - After returning to Budapest yesterday, Hungarian Prime Minister Teleki told the press about his impressions of visiting Germany, saying, "My Foreign Minister and I had a very good impression of our trip to Germany. When the German Head of State received us, German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop was also present. Italy was represented by Foreign Minister Ciano. The German Head of State, in his struggle for the survival of Germany and his experiment in stepping into a new powerful country, was willing to sacrifice his precious time to listen to our presentation and to learn about Hungary's important issues, which we deeply appreciated. In a two-hour and forty-five-minute conversation, the Foreign Minister and I presented various issues. The Head of State listened attentively and expressed great sympathy for the various issues. Regarding this point, the last sentence of the official communiqué can prove that the Axis powers all want to sincerely create a situation in all parts of Europe as a basis for permanent peace." (Haitong News Agency, 12th)

### Supreme Soviet of the Karelo-Finnish Republic Passes Constitution

Moscow - At its first session, the Supreme Soviet of the Karelo-Finnish Republic examined and passed the code governing the election of Soviet representatives from the cities, towns, and villages of the republic. At the same time, regulations regarding the determination of the borders between the Karelo-Finnish Republic and the Russian Federation were also passed. The conference also elected Kuusinen as Chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the Karelo-Finnish Republic. Furthermore, it reported that when the Supreme Soviet of the Karelo-Finnish Republic held a conference on the 9th, Kuusinen reported on the drafting process of the republic's constitution, solemnly declaring that a certain article of the constitution had recognized that the Finnish and Russian languages occupied an equal important position in the republic. It is said that "this regulation can enable the people of the Karelo-Finnish Republic to reach the highest peak in culture." Other deputies who participated in the debate also unanimously agreed that the draft constitution was satisfactory and recognized that the draft was indeed in conformity with the Stalin Constitution. After discussion, the conference unanimously passed the entire constitution. (TASS, 11th)

### Soviet Naval Maneuvers in the Baltic Sea Completed

London - News received here yesterday from Moscow Radio stated that the Soviet Baltic Fleet had held naval maneuvers in the Baltic Sea for three days, during which large-scale naval battles were practiced. All battleships, cruisers, destroyers, high-speed speedboats, submarines, and aircraft participated. The naval maneuvers were completed yesterday. It is decided that the naval maneuvers may be held on Soviet Navy Day. (United Press)

### Britain and Germany Engage in Diplomatic Struggle over the Pan-American Conference, U.S. Secretary of State Hull Makes a Statement, Accusing Germany of Threatening Latin America, British Ministry of Economic Warfare Issues Statement

Washington - Secretary of State Hull yesterday denounced Germany's warning to Costa Rica, Guatemala, and Nicaragua not to join the Pan-American Conference in acts of "non-neutrality." Hull believes that this is a means of intimidation by Germany, attempting to undermine the sovereignty of the Central American republics. At the same time, it is heard that Britain's proposal to the United States to organize an economic alliance of the Western Hemisphere under American supervision, not to sell military supplies to Germany, Italy, and Japan, has been shelved by the United States. According to Britain's proposal, all twenty-one republics of the Americas would become the backbone of Britain's blockade policy, and it may cause these countries to go to war with Japan. Officials here believe that Britain and Germany are fighting a fierce first round of fighting on the diplomatic front, both trying to use the Pan-American Conference to prevent their opponents from obtaining raw materials from Latin America. American diplomats are now trying to counter any attacks from Germany, that is, to point out to the governments of Latin American countries that all countries in the Americas must unite in order not to be crushed by German economic power. According to Hull's denunciation of Germany, it was due to reports that German Minister to Panama Reinbeck had made this statement. Someone asked Hull to comment on Reinbeck's move. Hull replied, "The Pan-American Conference was unanimously approved by the twenty-one republics of the Americas. The matters discussed are only related to these twenty-one countries. Reinbeck's warning seems to be a means of intimidation. It should be known that the sovereignty and freedom of action of the countries subject to this intimidation should be respected and are no different from those of other countries. No legal theory can defend an attack on this sovereignty." Authoritative sources said that the shelving of the British proposal does not hinder the conference's handling of this case. At least Britain can fulfill part of its wishes. It is also heard that Britain is now planning to launch an anti-totalitarian trade boycott in Latin America, and the United States is currently not opposed to its efforts. (International News Agency, 12th)

Washington - Secretary of State Hull met with reporters yesterday and, when referring to the activities of the German Minister to the five Central American republics, Reinbeck, said that Germany clearly intends to exert various threats on the Latin American countries. Reports say that Reinbeck, regarding the upcoming Pan-American Conference, "warned" the Central American governments not to engage in actions aimed at directly or indirectly opposing Germany. (Reuters, 12th)

London - The Ministry of Economic Warfare recently issued an article on the issue of discussing American surplus products at the Pan-American Conference convened in Havana, Cuba, on July 20, stating that if Japan remains neutral, Britain has no intention of interfering with its legitimate trade. What concerns Britain about this Pan-American Conference is to prevent supplies from being transported to Germany, Italy, or the countries occupied by German forces. It is rumored that Britain's blockade of Germany and Italy also includes Japan. This statement is inaccurate because Japan is a neutral country. Although the conference in Havana is not related to the issue of blockade, if goods shipped out of the United States are transported to enemy countries or enemy-occupied countries, they will be intercepted by the British contraband control station. Germany is now imposing a blockade on Britain, so any British blockade measures must not be relaxed slightly, otherwise it will only prolong the war. The problem of American surplus products has been exacerbated by the war. Britain is willing to cooperate with it to study possible solutions to this problem. (Reuters, 12th)

### US Democratic Party Drafts Election Platform: Roosevelt Decides to Participate in Election

Chicago - Amidst general uncertainty about President Roosevelt's willingness to run for a third term, leaders of the US Democratic Party have recently begun drafting the Democratic Party's 1940 election platform. It is said that this platform will not only attempt to reconcile with isolationists but also with conservative Democrats who oppose the New Deal. The Democratic National Convention will be held here on Monday, with over 3,000 delegates attending and a total of 1,094 votes. Representative Bankhead from Alabama, who is participating in the vice-presidential campaign, will deliver an important speech on Monday evening. Senator Barkley from Kentucky, also hoping to be selected as vice president, will deliver a speech on Tuesday evening. The Democratic platform is expected to be submitted for discussion and passage on Wednesday. The election of candidates will begin on Thursday. At that time, in addition to President Roosevelt's name, several other names will certainly be announced. However, today, much attention is being paid here to whether President Roosevelt will be nominated again. This sentiment is unavoidable while candidates are yet to be selected. Last night, some insisted on presenting Vice President Garner's name to the convention, regardless of President Roosevelt's decision to participate in a third campaign. Garner's name will be put forward by Garner's old friends Moro, Houston, and Baker of Texas, unless President Roosevelt indicates his willingness to participate in a third campaign. Senator Wheeler of Montana will also be nominated. Chairman Farley of the Democratic National Committee has also agreed to have his name put forward, but with reservations. Furthermore, according to rumors in Washington, President Roosevelt will announce his intentions within the next 24 hours. However, other rumors suggest that President Roosevelt will remain silent until the convention election begins, at which point he will announce his intentions to the delegates. (United Press dispatch, 11th)

Washington - US Secretary of the Interior Ickes claimed last night that there is no doubt that President Roosevelt will participate in the third presidential election. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)

### Vulnerability of the Suez Canal

Before the outbreak of the European War, regardless of day or night, summer or winter, a ship would pass through the Suez Canal's entrance and exit every eighty-two minutes at an astonishing speed, sounding its horn. The ship's time is most precious, so it cannot stop. Ships use the Suez Canal to save time, and any delay would diminish the value of the Suez Canal's existence. One hundred and twenty pilots who speak various languages are always on call.

The Suez Canal Company is responsible for the safety of every arriving ship. At night, searchlights are installed, and helmsmen and chief mates are sent on board to guide the ship, just as a trained nurse gives a baby a bottle.

The canal has a total of thirteen bends. If a ship accidentally crashes into one of these bends, it would be like a cork stuck in a bottle, halting all traffic for a week. However, year after year, this has never happened, proving the perfection of the organization.

The waterway managed by the company is one hundred and fourteen miles long. From Port Said to Suez is only one hundred and six miles, but due to the shallowness of the coast, the Mediterranean side requires six miles of dredged waterway, and the Red Sea side requires two miles. The channel originally excavated by the Frenchman Lesseps was through plains and sand, and did not present any engineering problems. The entire route utilized three natural depressions: Lake Manzala (27 miles), Lake Timsah (7 miles), and two other saltwater lakes (20 miles). Another section was the Demietta Canal, half of whose construction was successful. There are no rock layers along the canal. The Mediterranean Sea is only ten inches lower than the Red Sea, and there are practically no tides at either end. A freshwater canal branching from the Nile flows into Lake Timsah, so three different types of water mix in the main Suez Canal channel.

The main task of the Suez Canal Authority is to dredge the sediment discharged by the Nile that accumulates in its delta. The rivers of Egypt, like China's Yellow River and America's Mississippi River, can be described as rivers with a lot of sediment. The mouth of the Nile at Damietta is only twenty-five miles from the west entrance of the canal. The prevailing wind direction on the Mediterranean side is from the northwest, and the entire sea current along the southern coast of the Mediterranean also flows from west to east. The sediment from the river creates shoals along the coast, blocking the entrance to the Suez Canal.

To maintain a standard depth of thirty-seven feet, the Suez Canal Company has adopted two engineering plans. One is to build dikes to prevent sediment-laden currents from approaching the coast. The other is to continuously dredge the waterway to maintain its depth. These dikes extend outwards from Port Said, with three miles protruding above the water and another two miles below the water.

When the canal was first dug, the width of the canal bottom was sixty-five feet. However, due to changes over time, the wooden sailing ships of Lesseps' era have now been replaced by larger iron steamships. Therefore, the Suez Canal Company had to keep pace with the progress of modern shipbuilding. Currently, the width of the canal bottom has reached one hundred and eighty feet, and the width of the canal surface has reached four hundred and fifty feet. Two large ships with beam widths of eighty-five feet can pass each other comfortably. However, to prevent accidents, strict regulations have been put in place: one ship must stop, and the other must reduce its speed to five miles per hour. The original depth of twenty-five feet has also been increased to thirty-seven feet.

The faster the ships travel, the greater the resistance and the more violent the waves they generate. If a ship travels at its normal speed, the waves it generates will first damage the banks on both sides. The Suez Canal Company has therefore set a rule limiting ships with a draft of thirty feet to a speed of nine miles per hour.

Large ships have relatively small rudders, which allow them to have a wide turning angle in the open ocean. However, in a narrow waterway, a wide turning angle is extremely inconvenient. A speed of nine miles per hour eliminates the freedom to steer, further preventing them from turning. Therefore, safely guiding magnificent liners to the vast ocean is proof of the excellent skills of the Suez Canal pilots.

Although the Suez Canal Company is purely a commercial enterprise, its commercial capacity depends on external politics. External events, such as one government sending a note to another government, can cause the Suez Canal's stock to fall. The long-term decline in stock prices occurred in 1872, when people were still generally doubtful about the success of the project. The long-term rise in stock prices occurred in 1937, following the signing of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936, with shareholders seeing the price rise from fifty dollars to one thousand two hundred dollars per share. In 1935, when Italy invaded Abyssinia, the League of Nations implemented sanctions, and British Members of Parliament demanded the closure of the Suez Canal, the stock price fell to five hundred dollars. The price of Suez Canal stock can almost be used as a barometer of political trends.

The Suez Canal Company's concession ends in November 1968, when the land lease for the canal zone expires. This makes permanent improvements inconvenient, because after twenty-eight years, they may not recoup their investment. Also, because of uncertainty about the future, there are some difficulties in maintaining the canal's current engineering.

After the expiration of the lease, the canal will be unconditionally returned to King Farouk of Egypt or his successors. In November 1968, the Egyptian government may choose one of the following three options: (1) Purchase the company's assets at a fair price, making the business the property of the Egyptian government. Egyptian students and intellectuals have long passionately shouted the slogan "Eliminate all foreigners and foreign capital" and put the canal under Egyptian management. (2) The Egyptian government could lease it to a new company, with Japanese, German, and Italian interests as its main members. In this case, the Egyptian government could earn a large amount of rent. (3) The Egyptian government could lease it to the original company, extending the lease, increasing the rent, or increasing profits, and increasing the number of representatives on the board of directors.

From the general observation of people, if the current chairman of the company, Vogel, can reach a secret agreement with the Egyptian King beforehand, it will certainly enable the third choice to achieve its goal. If the amount of money is the decisive factor, then no other group has such financial strength. The excellent technical services and strong financial power of the company will surely give it a winning chance in holding the priority. In addition, some people believe that Britain will also exert great pressure on the contracting party to seek the establishment of a new treaty. Although the concession still has twenty-eight years to run, rumors are rife that some countries have allowed large sums of money to be used for acquisition activities.

### Anglo-American-Soviet Cooperation as a Factor in Stabilizing the Far East; American Foreign Policy Association Advocates Full US-Soviet Cooperation; Woodhead Suggests American Naval Deployment to the East

Recently, the situation in the Pacific has suddenly become tense. The complex relationships between Britain, the United States, Japan, and the Soviet Union indicate an increasingly delicate situation. The British authorities resolutely rejected Japan's request to blockade the Burma Road and implemented preparations to evacuate women and children from Hong Kong, ready to resist foreign aggression by force. The tension between Britain and Japan can be imagined. At the same time, after the July 7th Incident, and the incident where US Marines arrested 16 Japanese armed plainclothes military police within the defense zone, the Japanese deliberately magnified the severity of the incident and launched an anti-American movement in the Hongkou district, posting slogans and holding meetings everywhere, advocating the use of force against the United States. Although US-Japan relations are unlikely to break down due to this local incident, animosity between the two sides is unavoidable.

US-Soviet Cooperation Expected to Materialize

Therefore, the American Foreign Policy Association, recognizing that the threat of Japanese aggression cannot be ignored, has strongly advocated for it. A foreign newspaper editorial stated that this suggestion is very likely to materialize.

Effective Suggestions from Mr. Woodhead

According to the opinion of the famous British commentator Mr. Woodhead, the United States' naval presence in Honolulu indicates its determination not to abandon its interests in East Asia. He further mentioned the precautionary measures taken by the Hong Kong authorities, indicating the possibility of a Japanese attack on Hong Kong, and clarified the British authorities' determination to resist. Finally, he suggested that the US and British authorities could establish an agreement to transfer a portion of the US Navy to Singapore as a way to prevent the Japanese from advancing southward. This move by the United States is purely to safeguard its interests and maintain the status quo in the Pacific, and Japan should not use it as an excuse to object.

Soviet Policy Remains Consistent

The focus of the above two perspectives is to curb the Japanese expansionist ambitions. The development of the Pacific situation in this direction is clearly beneficial to China's resistance against Japan. The reporter also inquired with people in this city close to Soviet diplomatic circles about the Soviet Union's attitude towards China's resistance against Japan. They responded that the Soviet Union's policy towards China has always been consistent. As stated by Mr. Molotov, Chairman of the People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs, the Soviet people unanimously sympathize with China's heroic resistance. China's continued resistance will surely achieve final victory.

Embargo on Yunnan-Burma Road Not Justified

Yesterday, the "North China Daily News" published a letter from a reader stating that the Japanese government and its domestic newspapers have expressed great dissatisfaction with the British government's rejection of their request to embargo the Yunnan-Burma Road. However, on the other hand, we only need to closely observe the ships operated by the Japanese in their "occupied areas" to see that some war necessities are continuously transported from Siberia to Germany by the Japanese, and this has not stopped to this day. As far as we know, the British government has not protested to the Japanese because the latter is, after all, a neutral country, and its transportation is not subject to British supervision, so it cannot be prohibited from doing so. Based on the same situation, Britain, in the same capacity, can transport munitions to China via the Yunnan-Burma Road. Moreover, Japan has not officially declared war on China. After Japan declares war on China, it can use its naval power to detain ships, but such measures are illegal.

### Tomorrow is French National Day; Due to the Current Situation, No Extravagant Celebrations

Tomorrow is the 151st anniversary of the storming of the Bastille prison by the revolutionary masses of Paris, which led to the founding of the French Republic. In previous years, the French expatriate community in Shanghai would hold celebratory ceremonies as a matter of routine. The authorities would hold grand banquets and gatherings every July 14th. Various police stations and the French Concession fire brigade would hang electric lanterns and decorations to celebrate the National Day. This year, due to the current situation, they do not want to be too extravagant. A reporter from "New Voice News" learned from relevant sources that, in addition to flying flags to mark the occasion, there will be no other activities. A luncheon or dinner may be held at the French Chamber of Commerce at 7 pm to celebrate. At that time, French Ambassador Cosme and his wife, French Consul-General Eugene, and others will attend. The ambassador's private residence, Hague House, may host staff. The French expatriates and their friends in Shanghai will hold banquets and celebrations to commemorate the martyrs. It was not easy to establish it. On July 14, 1789, one hundred and fifty-one years ago, the revolutionary masses of Paris captured the Bastille prison, creating the Republican celebration and establishing a model for modern democratic nations. Although there were setbacks at that time, they finally relied on an indomitable spirit to overthrow the monarchy and create today's National Day.

### Japanese Claim to Have Purchased the Munitions Aboard the "Shengjing" Steamer; No Response from the French Garrison in Shanghai

The French military munitions transported from Tianjin on the Taikoo "Shengjing" steamer were automatically transported away by Japanese barges the day before yesterday. Regarding rumors of confiscation, according to Japanese claims, the munitions have been purchased. However, there has been no response from the French garrison in Shanghai, so it is impossible to know how the Japanese and French are negotiating. After unloading the munitions, the "Shengjing" steamer sailed into Songkou and docked at Pier No. 1 of the Bund in the French Concession to unload cargo. It is said that there is a lot of cargo. It was originally scheduled to depart for Tianjin today, but because of the delay in loading and unloading, it has been changed to tomorrow (Sunday) at 10 am. However, according to a Japanese naval spokesman at a reception for journalists last night, the munitions unloaded from the "Shengjing" steamer on Tuesday (the 9th) will be temporarily kept by the Japanese military. The spokesman continued that the protest against the ship for not heeding the order to stop and presenting it to the British naval authorities is currently under peaceful discussion between the two authorities.

### Seeking a Resolution to the Incident of the Arrest of Japanese Military Police; Japanese Military Officers Visit Colonel Baker Twice; Provide a More Detailed Explanation of the Incident

Regarding the case of sixteen Japanese military police officers arrested in the US military defense zone on the third anniversary of the July 7th Resistance, Japanese newspapers and expatriates have made a big fuss. However, the attitude of the Japanese officials has gradually eased. The US military authorities, believing that the fault does not lie with them, have consistently remained indifferent and calm. Although the issue has not been resolved, the tension has gradually eased. Colonel Baker's reply to the Japanese Military Police Headquarters was delivered to the Japanese side on the 10th. However, the Japanese side believes that this reply is mostly "unresponsive to the question," so it is necessary to provide a detailed explanation to the US Navy Fourth Regiment.

Reuters, Tokyo, 12th: A spokesman for the Japanese Foreign Ministry reiterated today while hosting foreign reporters that he hoped that the accidental incident between the US Marines and Japanese military police in Shanghai could be resolved locally, saying that the matter has been left to the Shanghai Japanese authorities for negotiation.

Two Visits for Detailed Explanation

Therefore, on Thursday (the 11th), two Japanese military officers were specially dispatched to visit Colonel Baker to explain the actual situation at the time of the incident. However, Colonel Baker was busy with official duties and did not grant a long conversation opportunity. Yesterday morning, the Japanese military officers visited the headquarters of the US Navy Fourth Regiment on Hardoon Road again to provide a detailed explanation to a certain US official. The official promised to relay the details to Colonel Baker.

Japanese Newspapers Exaggerate the Situation

According to a Japanese military spokesman at a reception for Western reporters yesterday, the actual detailed circumstances at the time of the incident are not fully known to the outside world. He did not want to criticize this matter too much. Yesterday's Japanese "Continental New Daily" published a "grand theory" on this case with a large amount of space, stating that this incident not only affects the prestige of the "Imperial Army" but also affects the honor and dignity of the entire Japanese nation. If this issue is not resolved appropriately and quickly, its impact on Japan's domestic political situation and foreign relations will be very serious, because the place where this incident occurred is Shanghai, a port to which international attention is attached.

Official Attitude Shows Caution

It is said that our country (Japan) authorities, with the support of all Japanese expatriates in Shanghai, are still taking a cautious attitude, hoping that the US Navy will take appropriate action on this case. However, the caution of our country (Japan) authorities should be limited. Therefore, if the US Navy delays in replying to the protest of the Military Police Commander Miura, our country authorities must take their final decision. This is a matter of course.

Tokyo Rhetoric Fuels the Flames

United Press International, Tokyo, 12th: Tokyo's "Nichinichi Shimbun" today demanded that the Japanese government adopt a "tit-for-tat, knife-for-knife" policy to resolve the incident between the US Marines and Japanese military police in Shanghai. The newspaper claimed that adopting this policy would not only prevent the occurrence of similar incidents but also resolve disputes. The newspaper pointed out two of the most meaningful elements of the Shanghai incident: one is that the incident occurred in Shanghai, where the Japanese flag has a dominant advantage; the second is that this happened because of the uncivilized US Marines, under the protection of the public concession.

### Japanese Misappropriation of Customs Revenue Reaches 200 Million; Britain Has a Responsibility to Recover the Large Sum of Money

Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the customs revenue of various ports has inevitably decreased compared to before due to tax evasion by unscrupulous merchants and the influx of inferior goods. However, the monthly income is still 8 million to 12-13 million yuan. Therefore, the average daily tax revenue of the Jianghai Customs is about 1 million yuan. Since the Anglo-Japanese Customs Agreement, although it is nominally deposited in the Mercantile Bank, it is actually no different from depositing it in the Japanese Yokohama Specie Bank. According to reporters from the "Ping Ming News Agency" who have reliable sources, the daily tax revenue of the Jianghai Customs, collected by the Yokohama Specie Bank and previously transferred to it, has so far accumulated to at least 200 million yuan. Among them, a considerable portion is used by the Japanese in the black market of this city to purchase foreign exchange. However, the Anglo-Japanese Customs Agreement stipulates that this customs revenue cannot be used for Japanese misappropriation. If there are any defaults in the future, the British Mercantile Bank should be responsible for recovering this huge amount of tax revenue. Therefore, the British side should at least investigate this amount with the Yokohama Specie Bank and prevent it from being further misappropriated. Because there are accurate account books for this large sum of money in the Jianghai Customs, it should be liquidated and returned to the original owner in the future.

### Overseas Chinese Contribute the Most to the War of Resistance, Remitting Huge Sums of Money; Donate 600 Million and Purchase Government Bonds for 1.1 Billion; Government's International Balance of Payments Depends on It

Since the successive fall of the wealthy coastal provinces, remittances from overseas Chinese have been a major source of financial support for the National Government's War of Resistance. According to the French "Political and Economic News," based on reports from overseas Chinese, since the Sino-Japanese Incident, overseas Chinese have remitted 600 million yuan back to the country to support the War of Resistance and purchased 1.1 billion yuan of government bonds. The "Japan Times" also has detailed records of this. According to reports, in peacetime, overseas Chinese remittances to China are about 30 million yuan per year, mostly from overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia, which is a major factor in balancing China's international trade. The 10 million overseas Chinese abroad suffer from harsh treatment from foreign authorities, so their patriotic sentiment is particularly strong. Whenever the motherland suffers from internal and external troubles, they dedicate their lives and property to the country without hesitation. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary success was greatly helped by overseas Chinese in spirit and strength. Since the Kuomintang came to power, the assistance of overseas Chinese has never decreased. The Chinese government has relied heavily on the assistance of overseas Chinese in quelling internal unrest. Since the Sino-Japanese Incident, the exact amount of funds donated by overseas Chinese to support Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek's War of Resistance is unknown, but according to those who have been published, there are donations from the following places:

Overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies donated 5,073,418 yuan in legal tender and 219,568 yuan in Hong Kong dollars. Overseas Chinese in British Borneo donated 897,896 yuan in Hong Kong dollars. From July 1937 to March 1940, the total amount of donations from overseas Chinese reached 600 million yuan, of which approximately 68.5 million yuan was remitted by the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission.

The largest donors are the overseas Chinese in Singapore and the Dutch East Indies. The 24 provinces under the rule of the National Government have lost 11 provinces, but the finances can still be maintained, and the assistance of overseas Chinese is the main reason. The amount of government bonds underwritten by overseas Chinese is even more significant, reaching as much as 1,116,188,451 yuan.

### German Embassy's Reception for Reporters Changed to Once Every Two Weeks

Haitong News Agency Special Report from this City: The information officer of the German Embassy in China usually hosts Chinese and foreign reporters in Shanghai every Thursday. Due to the hot weather, it has been changed to once every two weeks. The location is the German Building at No. 1 Dashilu. In addition to tea and snacks, films about the recent European war are shown. In case of special events, reporters from various newspapers are invited to hold a meeting. The time for the next reception is 5 pm on July 25th, and the location is No. 1 Dashilu.

### After a Large Number of Stamps Arrive in Shanghai, Usage Should Be Restored

After a large number of national government stamp tax tickets were shipped to Shanghai on the 26th of last month, all industries have been purchasing and affixing them. Many enthusiastic people refuse to accept receipts that do not have stamps affixed to them, in order to emphasize national tax. It is learned that there are still a few merchants who are still using the excuse that "post offices have stopped selling them and there is no way to purchase and affix them" to evade national tax. Relevant authorities have now dispatched personnel to various businesses to conduct a thorough investigation. All ledgers, bankbooks, and other documents and books that should have stamps affixed to them will be reported to the Special District Local Court if there is any omission, and they will be punished according to law. The authorities also hope that all customers and merchants will report those who evade affixing stamps as much as possible. It is also learned that counterfeit stamps have been discovered recently, and it is difficult to distinguish them at first glance. Therefore, for the sake of caution, all industries should directly purchase goods from the stamp sales agent of the North Sichuan Road Postal Administration to avoid being fooled.

### British Embassy Denies Evacuation of Overseas Nationals from Shanghai; The News Reported by White Russian Newspapers Has No Basis

According to various Japanese and Russian newspapers in this city, the British Embassy and Consulate in this city have recently issued a notice saying that the British authorities are preparing to evacuate British women, children, and various goods from Shanghai. The British Embassy in China recently denied this and said that the news has no basis.

### A Hurricane May Strike Shanghai; Customs Hangs Ball Warning; The Wind is Strong and Moving Quickly Towards Shanghai

A second new hurricane will strike Shanghai. At 3:30 pm yesterday, the Customs received a report from the Observatory that the hurricane originating from Komissima Island (transliteration) had reached 26.5 degrees north latitude and 127.5 degrees east longitude yesterday, still within 60 miles. The wind is quite strong and moving north-northwest. It is said that it may strike Shanghai, so the Customs hung a black ball on the flagpole on the roof of the clock tower at 4:53 pm yesterday (Customs clock) and changed to a red light at night to indicate a warning, so that ships on the Huangpu River could take precautions. However, the weather was still clear last night. The Gaodeng and Shantai ships were going to Ningbo yesterday. The Gaodeng ship still departed with passengers as usual after the Customs hung the ball warning. However, the Customs had no export report. It is said that the Shantai ship has stopped leaving Shanghai. Today, the Taikoo Qiongzhou and Jardine Matheson Yusheng ships, which were originally scheduled to depart for Haiphong this afternoon, depend on the condition of the hurricane on whether they could depart on time.

### Evacuation of Staff from the Nanshi Refugee Area Separately

Since Father Jacquinot left Shanghai to return to his country, the Nanshi Refugee Area was forced to disband the refugees who had been maintained in the area for three years at the end of last month because of the lack of a head and the extreme shortage of funds in the area. However, the staff of the various departments and shelters belonging to the general office of the area usually totaled hundreds of people.

### Hong Kong Funds Return to Shanghai Again; Approximately 150 Million Yuan

After the war, Shanghai was flooded with floating capital, leading to rampant speculation. Due to the serious situation in Europe, funds flowed back to Shanghai from Hong Kong. According to statistics, the amount is 150 million yuan. As a result, Shanghai's floating capital is becoming more abundant. The banking and money industries, recognizing that the abundance of floating capital leads to financial crises, are focusing on the finance of the hinterland in order to stabilize finance and prevent speculation, and are trying to divert floating capital to develop in the interior.

### Suicide Case at the New Asia Hotel; Truth of the Triangular Love; Jewish Mr. and Mrs. Meiyou Reconciled after Splashing Water; Russian Man Has an Affair with His Wife, and Everyone Does Not Object; Embezzlement of Public Funds Discovered, Three People Committed Suicide

The Continental Daily reported that one night this week, Jewish refugee Meiyou (48 years old), a tenant of the New Asia Hotel, his wife, and a White Russian named Kazi, committed suicide by poisoning at the same time. On Tuesday morning, it was discovered and sent to Gongji Hospital. Meiyou died at 9:05 am on Thursday morning. His wife and Kazi are still unconscious and their fate is uncertain. According to detectives from the police station, the Meiyou couple took refuge in Shanghai about a year ago and soon divorced. Kazi is an employee of the Czech company Xiba Bakery Factory at 394 Zhoushan Road. About two months ago, he met Mrs. Meiyou by chance and fell in love at first sight. He often visited, posing as the owner of the factory, behaving lavishly, in order to win Mrs. Meiyou's favor. However, Mrs. Meiyou and Kazi were not in contact for long before she reunited with her husband. Meiyou also did not object to his wife's contact with Kazi, and they lived in peace. However, good times do not last long. Kazi spent extravagantly, and his monthly salary was not enough to cover his expenses. He secretly altered the accounts in an attempt to cover up his actions, but was eventually discovered by Mr. Shijielakati, the owner of the factory, who reported it to the French Concession Police Station. It turned out that Kazi lived on Lafayette Road. Kazi, having heard the news, did not dare to go to work at the factory. On Sunday, he invited the Meiyou couple to a secret room in the New Asia Hotel and confessed to embezzling public funds. However, it is still a mystery why the three of them suddenly committed suicide together. The truth will not be known until Mrs. Meiyou and Kazi wake up. Also, the English "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" stated that Mr. Shijielakati, the owner of the Xiba Bakery Factory, filed a lawsuit in the Special First Court this (12th) morning against Kazi (51 years old), the Russian manager of the factory, for embezzling 1,500 yuan of public funds. The case is scheduled to continue on the 19th of this month. It is learned that the amount of money embezzled by Kazi is more than this. After a detailed investigation, the amount may reach 50,000 yuan in total. Kazi is now in the hospital and his condition has improved. However, Mrs. Meiyou's condition has worsened. It is learned that Kazi embezzled public funds and, knowing that he had been exposed, invited the Meiyou couple to the New Asia Hotel, told them the truth, saying that there was no solution other than the three of them committing suicide together. The Meiyou couple, because their expenses depended on Kazi, agreed to take poison and die together upon hearing this.

### 代客贖當判處拘役　工部局嚴予取締

Recently, a new type of business has emerged in Shanghai, namely the so-called "redeeming pawns for customers." It has become very popular, and such shops can be seen at the entrances of various roads and alleyways. The business scope of these shops is specifically to collect pawn tickets. Because pawnshops greatly reduce the value of the pledged items when accepting them, these shops, when buying pawn tickets, in addition to deducting the pledged amount, also give customers a small amount of money to obtain the ownership of the pawn ticket, prepare funds to redeem the items from the pawnshop, and then sell them again. Through this transaction,

the shops that redeem pawns for customers earn huge profits, which is actually a business of exploiting the poor. Moreover, the authorities of the Municipal Council believe that the existence of this business not only exploits the poor, but also causes major difficulties for the police in handling cases due to the circulation of pawn tickets. This is because common thieves and bandits, after stealing and robbing items, sell the pawn tickets to these people. However, the police often obtain clues from the pawn tickets when cracking theft cases. Now that the rightful owner has lost the ticket, it is also difficult to solve the case. Therefore, an order was issued to ban these shops, requiring all pawn redemption shops within the concession to close completely by the end of May of this year; otherwise,

legal action will be taken. After this order was issued, many people complied with it, but there were still quite a few who continued to operate. The day before yesterday afternoon, Chinese and foreign detectives from the Hongkou police station discovered several people operating this type of pawn redemption business in Dexing Lane, Peng Road. Eight people were arrested, including Ying A'gen, Yu A'miao, Zhang Yaoming, Gu Yanying, Li Peixuan, Peng Liankun, Ni Changle, and Zhang Shuwan. Three suitcases of pawn tickets and account books were seized and taken back to the police station. Yesterday, they were sent to the Special First Court for violation of police regulations. The police station filed a lawsuit in accordance with Article 33, Section 1 of the Regulations on Punishment of Police Violations, requesting that they be punished according to law. After questioning by Judge Shen Shanzeng, the eight people, including Ying, were sentenced to seven days of detention each as a warning.

### Over Ten Thousand More Bags of Foreign Rice Arrive, Rice Prices Plummet Again by Two or Three Yuan

The downstream rice market has been sluggish for days. Yesterday, a large batch of foreign rice continued to arrive, causing even more public anxiety. The prices of various types of foreign rice plummeted again by two or three yuan. Merchants saw the market glutted with goods and shrinking by the day. Aside from some shops in this street replenishing their stock, other outlets have completely stopped. The more they try to sell, the more intense the slump becomes. Although the volume of transactions seemed to increase slightly as a result, the prices of various types of foreign rice have fallen by another two or three yuan compared to the previous market. At the close, No. 1 Saigon was only 60 yuan and 5 jiao, 60 yuan; No. 2 was 57 yuan and 5 jiao, 57 yuan; No. 1 Siam was 60 yuan; No. 2 was 57 yuan and 5 jiao, 57 yuan; Fire-milled was 59 yuan, 58 yuan and 5 jiao; Hong Kong Pointed was 56 yuan and 5 jiao, 56 yuan and 2 jiao; Tokyo Pointed was 54 yuan and 5 jiao, 53 yuan; Broken Pointed Special was 45 yuan, ultimately 40 yuan; Rice Tea was 47-48 yuan. Only Small Milled was the most popular, and although it depreciated less, it was still fresher than other goods, remaining at 58 yuan and 5 jiao. However, the market sentiment for foreign rice is gradually clearing up as more of it comes in, and the market is turning around. Additionally, transshipment assistance has slightly increased, resulting in prices rising by half a yuan compared to the previous day. The total market transaction volume was over 400 tons. The Yinghua Company immediately traded No. 2 Siam rice at a price of 70 yuan. The price for rice loaded on June 20 was 68 yuan and 5 jiao to 8 jiao, and for rice loaded on June 26, it was 68 yuan to 68 yuan and 6 jiao and a half.

The arrival of japonica and glutinous domestic rice remains scarce. The sales market is currently in a depressed state, and both the open and black markets are declining. As a result, prices are falling along with foreign rice, continuing to drop by one or two yuan. Rumor has it that the Changbang Special Clean Japonica is only 70 yuan, Su Kun Changzhou White Japonica is 67-68 yuan, Decided-Under Accommodation is 64-65 yuan, Qing Si Thin Rice is 68-69 yuan, Nangang Early Rice is 65-66 yuan, and Hu Jian is around 63 yuan. Glutinous rice Jinli goods are 64-65 yuan, Changdan goods are 62-63 yuan, Hong Kong White Yuan is 65 yuan, etc.

The arrival of foreign rice in Shanghai is booming. The day before yesterday, a total of six ships arrived in Shanghai. Except for the Taikoo Company's Chengdu ship, whose exact number was unknown due to its late arrival, the five ships together brought over 77,000 bags, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that the Chengdu ship carried 14,702 bags, which were unloaded at the company's dock in Pudong.

### 鳳凰牌粉貶價

### Phoenix Brand Flour Devalued

Flour is quite soft, as Japanese flour and miscellaneous domestic brands of flour are taking the opportunity to dump their product as the supply from Chinese flour factories is reduced. There are continuous sales of foreign flour, and people are generally discouraged. Yesterday, due to the sharp drop in rice prices, buyers were solely focused on driving down prices. It is reported that the prices of Japanese flour Phoenix brand are falling even more sharply, with the July price only 15 yuan and 4 jiao, August 15 yuan and 7 jiao and a half, September 16 yuan. Other domestic flours are also falling by 1 or 2 jiao. The offer price from Chinese flour factories remains 15 yuan and 2 jiao, with 3,000 to 4,000 bags supplied by the Fufeng factory.

The new wheat market is also easing. Inquiries are all being handled in Hongkou. The majority is purchased by Japanese factories, with prices around 23 yuan per 100 catties. The Chinese factories have not been able to purchase a large amount, so the market is not officially opening. It is heard that Fuxin and Fufeng have purchased Australian foreign wheat, and the first batch is expected to arrive in Shanghai at the end of this month.

From the beginning of the morning, the price per bar (ten taels) was initially affected by the declining exchange rate and the tightening of the US exchange rate. The market's sentiment from the previous day was good, which led to strong buying interest when it opened, and the price immediately jumped by 40 yuan. The silver firm purchased 30 taels for 5,530 yuan. Subsequently, the currency exchange industry and the gold and silver firms bought in, and the price continued to rise by 30 yuan. The silver firm sold 20 taels to the currency exchange industry, rising to 5,560 yuan. However, at this time, the foreign exchange market suddenly loosened, and the silver and gold firms turned from buying to selling. Moreover, many long positions in the currency exchange industry were closed. Some traders heard that HSBC was releasing a large amount of both British and American currency, so they went short in the gold market. As a result, the selling pressure gradually increased, and the price continued to fall. After 11 o'clock, it even broke through the 5,400 yuan level. The silver firms traded 20 taels among themselves, and the price dropped to 5,365 yuan. After that, the selling pressure eased slightly, and some gold and silver firms bought back their short positions at low prices. The silver firm purchased 20 taels from the gold firm by noon, for 5,400 yuan, which was the noon closing price. The market situation was quiet in the afternoon. It opened slightly lower, and the silver firm conducted some trading for 10 taels, for 5,390 yuan. Then, because the gold firm was releasing gold, the price fell again by 10 yuan. The gold firm sold 10 taels to the silver firm, dropping to 5,380 yuan. Subsequently, a certain silver firm and the currency exchange industry gradually absorbed it, and the market situation turned around. The gold firm sold a total of 30 taels to silver store companies and currency exchange companies, reaching as high as 5,425 yuan. Afterwards, the gold firm continued to release gold, reducing the price again by 10 yuan. The silver firm traded 10 taels for 5,415 yuan, which was the evening closing price. As a result, it fell by 75 yuan compared to the previous day, with a total fluctuation of 195 yuan throughout the day. The selling price of the gold shops' own-brand gold was about 10 yuan higher than the spot price, and the purchase price was reduced by 30 yuan. The current standard gold price was more than 50 yuan lower than the posted gold price, and there were few open trades.

The Results for Gold Jewelry were Unchanged

The initial price for jewelry gold at silver stores was still 560 yuan per tael at Datongxing. It increased by 10 yuan at 9:30, fell back by 10 yuan at 10:15, and then fell again by 10 yuan at 11:15. It increased by 10 yuan at 3:00 PM, with a result of flat overall. Datongxing still priced it at 560 yuan. The prices at Xintongxing were the same, with purchase prices reduced by around 30 yuan.

### US Dollar Bills: Profit-Taking

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw spot gold bars rise and then fall, with British and American gold pounds showing the same trend, ultimately falling by two and a half yuan. British gold notes were in strong demand in the afternoon, and the price rose by 0.3 yuan. US dollar notes initially continued the tight trend from the previous day, rising to 17 yuan, 1 jiao, and 2 fen at 9:30 AM. Later, due to disputes over profit-taking, they were dumped, falling to 16 yuan, 6 jiao, and 2 fen. Finally, they closed at 16 yuan, 6 jiao, and 8 fen, down by 0.12 yuan compared to the previous day. Hong Kong notes showed a firm trend, and the price rose by 0.02 yuan. The demand for Japanese gold notes decreased sharply, and the market price fell, retreating to 1 yuan, 1 jiao, 9 fen, and 5 li in the evening market. There was a slight supply of Korean notes, with the evening market at 0.98 yuan.

### Miscellaneous: Cigarette Black Market Rises

The cigarette black market has been rising recently. Because there is a scarcity of goods in the market, there are widespread rumors that the Yizhong Cigarette Factory is being reorganized. Buying interest was strong. The British-American Tobacco brand rose 70 yuan compared to last week. The Wuhua brand exceeded the market price by more than 30 yuan. The opening prices yesterday were 968 yuan for the British-American Tobacco brand, 647 yuan for the Pinhai brand, 760 yuan for the Lao Dao brand, and 503 yuan for the Wuhua brand. People were panicking, so prices soared. (Added)

### Securities: Foreign Shares Continue to Perform Strongly — Two Rubber Stocks Issue Dividends

Yesterday's securities black market was even more chaotic, and trading decreased even more. People are not interested in these dogs, and the number of people gathering in the market is becoming increasingly scarce, which makes people feel uneasy. Therefore, it is not easy to break the stagnant situation for the time being. Yesterday's transactions were mostly just small retail investors closing deals on the floor. There were very few new investors or large investors joining in. The market is gradually losing its speculative nature. As a result, it recovered slightly by about 0.1 yuan, with a total transaction volume of about 300,000 yuan. A brief summary is provided below:

For stock trading, 50 shares of the Commercial Press were traded at a price of 70 yuan each.

Although yesterday was Friday for the Public Industry Association, there were no weekend closings. The market continued to perform strongly, with the increases being more forceful. Near the close, the buying activity was particularly good, which shows that the market currently has abundant funds and that speculators and investors have confidence in the future outlook. The future dividends of rubber stocks will definitely meet the expectations of most people. It cannot be said that the rising prices are without reason. Industrial stocks have also risen sharply, but their activity is slightly worse than that of rubber stocks. With no special changes in the weekend news, the market is expected to continue to rise next week.

Chaw Kangsha, manager of the British-owned Huatong Foreign Company, and two oak tree companies, Yingda District Co., Ltd., announced the distribution of interim dividends for 1940. Chaw Kangsha will pay 0.25 yuan in national currency per share, starting from July 30, and Yingda District will pay 1.5 yuan in national currency per share, starting from August 6.

London, 11th (Thursday) Telegraph: The listed prices of Chinese foreign debt and stocks of various Far East British companies were generally stable today, with no changes in the market. (According to the previous two days, only HSBC's shares showed slight fatigue, with Hong Kong registered shares falling by one pound on the 9th, to 65 pounds, and British registered shares falling by one pound on the 10th, to 64 pounds.)

### 紗花　棉紗大戶　逢高仍有賣出

### Cotton Yarn: Major Cotton Yarn Dealers Still Selling at High Prices

The yarn market initially rose and then declined, with the overall result being flat. In fact, after rising for several days, the amount of spot yarn currently available from the Hong Kong dealers has been substantial. There has been a temporary sense of saturation, so purchasing has greatly decreased today. However, most insiders are still optimistic. A certain major dealer has shown a tendency to sell at high prices. In short, yarn prices are fluctuating within 100 yuan.

The opening price for spot yarn continued the momentum from the previous day, with many taking the opportunity to raise prices aggressively, creating a surging situation. The opening price for 20-count Double Horse was 1,045 yuan, up more than 30 yuan. Shortly after, it rose to 1,064 yuan. As soon as this high price opened, a selling frenzy arose as many long positions took the opportunity to close. As a result, the market loosened and the price gradually fell to 1,013 yuan. After fluctuating at this low point for a long time, it recovered and rose to 1,020 yuan. The closing price was 1,017 yuan. According to statistics, 1,427 packages were traded during the half-day. The price for 20-count Double Horse rose by 3 yuan. 100 pieces of export yarn were shipped to Haikou today, and 650 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong. The amounts purchased by various parties are listed below:

Dealers, 130; Ningbo, 77; Hong Kong, 160; Mainland, 60; Total, 1,427.

### Factory's Appetite is Weak, Cotton Market Quiet

The unusually bustling cotton situation of the day before yesterday suddenly dissolved yesterday. This is because various parties have sufficient stock on hand, and when the market improves, everyone is eager to unload. As for the factories, they lack a strong appetite, thus business has returned to a quiet state.

American Cotton Packed at $203.00, 63 Bales Purchased by Fellow Traders

Supplementary Market Prices Not Recorded Last Time:

General Packed at $195.00, 500 Bales Domestic and Foreign Purchase

North Market: $151.00, 500 Bales Purchased by Feng Kee

Dazhong Collective: $201.00, 100 Bales Purchased by Fellow Traders

Hui Shi Deng: $2108.00, 200 Bales Purchased by Tong Xing

Additional News: The opening of the foreign cotton market yesterday morning was quite active. After selling, due to purchases in the market on Wall Street, some short positions were covered. As a result, closing prices were down 2-3 points for near-term deliveries compared to the previous day, and up 5-6 points for long-term deliveries. The Indian cotton market was quite firm, rising another 2 robies yesterday, including forecasts.

The foreign cotton trade in Shanghai has entered a lively phase, with transactions being quite good, involving over a thousand bales. However, most purchases were made by Japanese factories. With stable yarn prices, Chinese factories are also showing buying interest, but due to tight credit, they cannot match the Japanese factories' forward transactions. Therefore, fewer transactions are concluded. Current cotton stocks have decreased significantly, and most floating orders have been cut and sold. Moreover, the transportation of Indian cotton is difficult. Therefore, the future cotton market is on the right track, and the sentiment among traders is quite strong.

### Coal and Indian Coal Flood In

Since summer, the sales of Durgapur coal have been slow. Orders have already been reduced, but the supply continues to be frequent, and prices are increasingly unsustainable. Recently, a certain firm received an order for over 10,000 tons of lump coal and fines. The coal has been unloaded from the trains at the docks. The prices for opening the door for merchants are 250 yuan per ton for lump coal and 230 yuan for coal fines. Fellow traders picking up their own coal from the trains will receive a deduction of 20 yuan per ton.

### Oil Cakes - Bean Cakes Plummet

After the rainfall, the bean cake market saw a brief surge in confidence, and prices rose sharply. However, this did not last long, as the weather showed no further signs of rain. Speculators in bean cakes were hit hard, and the market situation deteriorated daily, with prices plummeting. Yesterday, the market fell sharply by another 6 jiao, more than 2 yuan below the peak price (on the 4th). Only 4,000 pieces of Sheng Ji cakes were settled by inland traders, priced from 11 yuan 3 jiao to 11 yuan. 700 pieces of Da You Si Pai cakes were priced at 12 yuan 8 jiao to 6 jiao. One cart of Yuan Long cakes was priced at 11 yuan. One cart of Fei Zi cakes was priced at 11 yuan 1 jiao. 1,100 pieces of Qing Zhong cakes were priced from 11 yuan to 10 yuan 4 jiao. On the 13th, 635 bales of soybeans and 600 bales of sesame seeds were shipped to Hong Kong.

### Piece Goods - Cotton Cloth Speculation Resurges

Domestic Cloth: The cloth market continued to rise this morning due to renewed speculation. Traders are increasing their inventory, and buying interest is strong. However, the number of pieces offered by the factories is limited, making the market quite tight. There is a trend of increasing prices with each sale. Sales of white cloth from Yihe rough cloth suddenly increased by 5 jiao to 1 yuan per bolt. Printed cloth from the Lun Chang factory and other goods increased by 1 yuan to 1.5 yuan per bolt. Fine cloth, twill, and rough cloth from various Chinese factories also increased by about 5 jiao per bolt. Over 500 pieces of white cloth, over 200 pieces of bleached and dyed cloth, nearly 300 pieces were handled by the Ningbo gang, and over 2,000 bolts of fine twill were handled by the Hong Kong gang were transacted on this street.

Eastern Cloth: Due to the continued rise in yarn prices, speculative buying by outside investors suddenly increased in the morning market, and prices rose sharply. Twelve-pound Longtou fine cloth was sold at 31 yuan 7-8 jiao, and Sijunzi Serge reached 9 jiao 3.5 fen per yard. However, soon after, fellow traders started selling, and fine cloth dropped to 30 yuan 4 jiao. The minimum price in the afternoon fell to 29 yuan 5 jiao. Finally, due to the excessive decline, fellow traders covered their positions and the price rebounded to 30 yuan 5 jiao at closing. Serge was at 8 jiao 9 fen. In terms of actual sales, over 200 pieces of fine cloth and over 50 cases of Serge were handled by the Tianjin gang, while scattered buyers and traders made speculative transactions. The total turnover of various goods was around 1,000 pieces. Therefore, although market prices were lower than the previous day, the situation is gradually stabilizing.

Exports: Today, 70 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Hong Kong, and another 90 pieces were shipped to Haikou.

### Old News, Newly Copied - Sixty-Seven Years Ago - (443) - (From the Shen Bao of the Twelfth Year of Tongzhi, Qing Dynasty)

Acrobatic Performance with Ropes (2)

A person stands on the back of a horse, and the horse moves like an arrow, while the person stands as steady as a mountain. When returning, the person rotates in all directions, standing on the horse's back. Then, they perform "Lingbo Double Scissors," doing a handstand on the saddle. Suddenly, they move left and right, doing a somersault and sitting upright on the horse. At this time, the cheers are like a mountain collapsing and a river boiling. The horse has already disappeared in the distance. The third time, the person clings to the horse's belly, rising and falling suddenly, like turning in circles. From dawn until the sun rises, the horse riding performance ends. After removing makeup and resting briefly, the spectators disperse. Soon after, they begin the knife ladder act. A soft ladder is placed next to the knife ladder, with ropes tied to the knives to facilitate climbing. Each step is about two feet apart, with more than twenty knives in total, making about twenty steps on the ladder. At midday, when the gong suddenly sounds, the spectators gather again. Two women walk up together, said to be climbing the knife ladder. Reaching the middle, they perform the "inverted pearl curtain" move, doing somersaults, continuously ascending the blades. Nearing the top, a knife is placed horizontally, with the back facing up and the blade facing down, upon which one woman briefly sits. Soon after, a woman and a child continue to climb, as swift as a monkey climbing a tree. When the ladder can no longer accommodate them, they climb to the very top, sitting on a chair-table. The two women use the chair circle and their hands to perform various acrobatic tricks, such as handstands and butterfly flips. Suddenly, one woman hangs upside down, pretending to lose her footing, falling from the sky. At this moment, the spectators' hearts are filled with fear. Not daring to blink, the woman wraps her feet around a rope and stands upright. In a few days, people come from far and wide to watch, with crowds incessantly streaming along the road.

### Jesus is the Savior of Women

The Jews and all ancient peoples had customs of valuing men over women. The Book of Genesis records that "woman came from man." The Jews misunderstood this, leading to various tragedies of disrespect for women in their thousands of years of history. In our own history, lacking understanding of the true principles, we treated women cruelly. "A woman's lack of talent is a virtue," and "men manage external affairs, women manage internal affairs," leading to women having no status in society. Moreover, there were "three obediences and four virtues," as well as "seven grounds for divorce" and other enslaving education and systems that restricted them, turning them into appendages and playthings of men. In reality, women also experience ten months of pregnancy. Apart from slight differences in physiological structure compared to men, there is no inherent hierarchy of male superiority and female inferiority. After Jesus came into the world, he did not disrespect women because the Jews disrespected them. Instead, he respected them, raising their status and making them equal to men.

Jesus advocated that men and women who committed adultery should be punished equally. He also advocated that men could divorce adulterous women, but did not specify that women could not divorce adulterous men. He also advocated that one husband and one wife is a sacred truth and that scripture should not be misinterpreted or laws created by man used to easily separate them. He further warned men, saying, "Anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart."

During his time in the world, Jesus did not discriminate between men and women in spreading the gospel, healing diseases, exorcising demons, preaching, or forgiving sins. Examining the Bible, it is clear and undeniable. Furthermore, after he rose from the dead on the third day, he first appeared to a woman named Mary. The first believer in Europe was a woman named Lydia, who sold purple cloth. The first girls' school in China was founded by the Jesus Church. Other institutions established by Christians to benefit women and improve the status of women are too numerous to count.

In short, wherever Jesus’s teachings reach, the women there gain liberation and salvation. Reading the history of ancient and modern times, and looking at the phenomena in our society, it is women who suffer the most, are the most oppressed, and are the most abused. Alas! The modern world is mass-producing lonely widows, adding pain upon pain to women. The modern world applies all kinds of pressure, forcing women onto the path of sin and destruction. Who is the savior of women? Thanks be to God! Because Jesus was sent into the world to save us. I sincerely hope that my female compatriots in China will quickly turn around and accept your teacher, Jesus Christ.

### Dead People

— Tao

What is a dead person? Is it simply someone who has stopped breathing? That's probably the common answer. But if you ask a deeper, more forceful question: what kind of person is a dead person? Edison already answered, "Every person who has no value is a dead person." In Pythagoras's school in ancient times, if someone got tired of studying and wanted to quit, everyone would hold a funeral for them as they left, erecting a tombstone to warn other students, because they believed that the quitter was a dead person and hoped that others would not follow in their footsteps. Similarly, in countries where Catholicism was prevalent at that time, every woman who entered a convent always brought a coffin with her and held a solemn funeral, indicating that she could no longer achieve anything—that is, she was dead!

Based on this view, if we look at the world, we can see that many powerful, well-fed, and well-dressed people are already dead. They merely maintain a illusory life and display decoration, but in reality, aren't they no different from walking corpses? Only those people in the world whose purpose is to improve themselves and increase the welfare of others can be considered alive. In the short span of sixty or seventy years of life, as it seems now, a person only lives for a few years, and most of the world is filled with dead people. Some people only start living at twenty, some at thirty, some at sixty, while others die before they even live!

When the ancient Persian king Xerxes stood on a small mountain and looked out, he couldn't help but weep, thinking that none of these many soldiers would still be alive in a hundred years! Therefore, Edison said: "When I look at this populous city, I can't help but weep! Because few of these many people are alive now, and observing the cause of their death, most of them are attacked by a disease with a very destructive power, which is commonly called 'laziness.'" So we should try our best to eradicate this epidemic and try our best to promote the early birth of youth and the resurrection of the elderly!……!"

Do you want to be a dead person? Do you want to be seen as a dead person? If not, then quickly examine whether your life is meaningful, whether you have been invaded by "laziness," and move towards the path of life!

### Lenin's Remains

— Zhendong

In recent international affairs, besides the United States, Soviet Russia can be said to be the most eye-catching country in the world. And the success of Soviet Russia today makes one think of Lenin, the founding father of Soviet Russia. He is one of the world's great men, and the only person in the world whose remains have been preserved to this day. Lenin died on January 21, 1924, which is sixteen years ago this year. His remains are in Red Square in Moscow. Lenin's tomb is entirely made of granite, and the tomb passage is quite tortuous. However, the architectural style is simple and solemn. Visitors walk down the stone steps to a large room, in the center of which is the place where Lenin's remains are located. A red rug is spread on top, and the body is placed in a glass coffin, through which one can see his remains. The body is covered with a velvet blanket, with the head, shoulders, and hands exposed. He looks as if he is sleeping peacefully, and his face is slightly gray. The fact that his remains can be preserved for so long for millions to admire is due to the efforts of two outstanding Soviet Russian scientists.

When Lenin died at his residence in Gorki, outside Moscow, the government ordered that embalming techniques be applied to the remains, injecting preservative solutions into the blood vessels. However, this method was not very effective. At that time, tens of thousands of people flocked to see the remains. Lenin died on January 21st, and by mid-February, more than 100,000 people had visited Red Square to pay their respects. But by the end of February, the skin of the remains had shown signs of drying out and discoloration, indicating that it was necessary to study alternative preservation methods. Therefore, the authorities convened many famous scientists from the country to discuss how to prevent the appearance of the remains from changing. However, after several meetings, they unanimously said that this was impossible, because it was impossible to prevent the external tissues of a corpse from changing in air and at normal temperatures. The mummies of ancient Egypt were only to prevent the corpse from decomposing further, but to keep the appearance unchanged had not been invented in recent science. However, Stalin hired Professor Uroplov, a famous anatomist, and Professor Sparoski, a biochemist, to conduct painstaking research and create a unique method that could preserve the appearance for a long time and permanently. On March 26, 1924, they performed another operation to prevent the face from shrinking and to stop the cell tissues from self-destructing. Thus, Lenin's remains became mummified. This method was successfully applied using the latest knowledge and skills in anatomy and biochemistry. After four months of efforts by the two professors, the work was completed on July 26, achieving the expected goal. Lenin's tomb was reopened to the public, and over 16 million people have visited it in the sixteen years and several months since then. Whenever foreigners come to Moscow, visiting the remains becomes a necessary part of the itinerary. The remains are still in perfect condition and will not change in the future. The two professors have also been responsible for the preservation and care of the remains. However, Professor Uroplov passed away in 1937, and now Professor Shi and several of his assistants continue to work.

### Creating Destiny

— Yang Tongfang

Living in this competitive society, everyone should cultivate a strong sense of self-confidence. No matter how difficult the environment or how many times we fail, we should always use the greatest perseverance to overcome them. After crossing through layers of darkness, we will surely step onto the path of light. Many people become discouraged when they encounter difficulties, or lose heart in adversity. They cannot muster the courage to make further efforts. Decadence, discouragement, disappointment, and depression bury their future, making them feel that life has no value worth cherishing.

In the long journey of life, it will never be smooth sailing forever, without unexpected setbacks. If we encounter an unfavorable situation and do not want to overcome it, merely evading the responsibility of striving forward, then difficulties will never leave. This fully expresses the fatalistic thinking of world-weariness, believing that the success or failure of people's careers depends on predetermined fate, which cannot be reversed by human effort.

In fact, fate is not really a hindrance to our success. Throughout history, countless entrepreneurs and academics have relied on strong self-confidence and perseverance, endured countless hardships, and were ultimately able to make great contributions to humanity. Undoubtedly, they broke free from the shackles of fate and became people who controlled their destiny. Why do we say that they are people who control their destiny? Because they believe in themselves and believe that they can overcome adverse circumstances and move towards their set goals. Difficulties are only powerful factors that hone them, and failures increase their courage to continue fighting. They have a firm belief in life, and no setbacks or obstacles can shake their will. The success of these people is due to their ability to "create destiny," believing that destiny is in their hands and cannot be manipulated by others.

Conversely, those weaklings who cannot withstand the storms of life, when encountering adversity, only passively endure and conform, as if destined to be manipulated by fate. They never plan to overcome difficulties, and even go from "accepting fate" to "resenting fate," pitying themselves and thinking that encountering misfortune is inevitable, and simply cannot find a better path than to resent and complain about fate.

Ibsen said, "You must cast this material into pottery," which is very capable of alerting us to strengthen the confidence of life, temper ourselves through hardship, educate ourselves, and always be a person who "creates destiny"!

Hawthorne Case

### The Sudden Return of the Dancing Queen

— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter 3: Conflicting Information

When I heard this, I had to admit that the situation had progressed further. Just now, Jinmei repeatedly said that Yu Gantang hadn't been back since the argument on the eleventh, which made me feel like she was deliberately covering for him. Now it was confirmed. But why was she doing this?

Hawthorne nodded and said, "From Jinmei's tone, I had already guessed that Yu Gantang had been here last night. Lao Mao, when did he come last night? How did you see him? Weren't you out watching a show last night?"

Lao Mao said, "I saw him just as I was leaving to watch the show. It was about seven o'clock. I had just walked out the door when I suddenly saw him standing at the entrance."

"Did he greet you?"

"He asked me, 'Is Miss Wang home?' I replied that she wasn't. He also asked, 'Has Zhao Boxiong been here today?' I replied that he hadn't. Then I asked him if there was anything I could do. But he ignored me and turned around and left."

Hawthorne pondered for a moment and then said, "You say he's the murderer, but is it just because of these two things?" Lao Mao shook his head and said, "No, there's also—there's something even more suspicious."

"Something even more suspicious? What?"

"Yesterday morning, when I was washing the stairs, he called on the phone—sir, the telephone booth is right on the turn of the stairs."

"Did you answer it?"

"Yes, he didn't say his name, but I could tell it was his voice. He wanted Miss Wang to talk to him, so I went upstairs to tell her."

"Did Miss Wang talk to him?"

Lao Mao nodded. "She did, but after only a few words, they started arguing on the phone." (43)

### There Are Reasons For Everything

— Xiaotian

Mozi wore himself out from head to toe benefiting all under heaven. Yang Zhu would not sacrifice a single hair to benefit all under heaven, for his own sake. Thinking about it carefully, each had their own reasons. Mozi was willing to sacrifice himself to fulfill his obligations to the people of the world. If everyone could sacrifice themselves to fulfill their obligations to others, then where would there be any struggle for rights in the world? Yang Zhu was unwilling to pluck a hair to benefit others, but conversely, he would never want others to pluck a hair to benefit him. If everyone embraced the principle of neither wanting to suffer losses nor take advantage of others, then the world would be at peace. England wants to wipe out aggressors, saying it is fighting to maintain peace. Germany attacked countless countries, saying it was to strive for lasting peace. France initially resisted Germany, then surrendered to the enemy, and finally turned against England, yet it also had its own plausible reasons. Truly, there are reasons for everything.

Speaking of the Peking opera performers who are very influential in the performing arts world, it is the same. Tan Fuying adheres to the traditional style, Ma Lianliang emphasizes recitative over singing, innovating and introducing the new, Yan Jupeng uses his old foundation to cope with his voice. When encountering a highlight, he slows down the tempo and amplifies his voice, and the audience's applause inevitably follows. This is due to the limitation of talent. If he does not exert great effort and cannot cater to the audience's psychology, we should forgive him. As for the four tones and yin-yang nuances, after Mei Lanfang, he is still the most particular about them. Mei Lanfang's voice is broad and bright, coupled with a resonant erhu, which sounds good. Cheng Yanqiu's voice is slightly dry and astringent, and without the use of delicate tones, it lacks the lingering and poignant emotions. Some who learn from Mei Lanfang desperately slow down the tempo, those who learn from Cheng desperately force their voices to be thin, and those who learn from Ma ideally include dozens of entering-tone "bu" characters in their lyrics (note that there are no entering tones in Northern tunes; in the Beijing dialect, only the donkey cart drivers used a "da" sound, and then there's Lianliang's "bu" character). They say that without doing so, they cannot closely resemble them. Truly, there are reasons for everything.

Dancers say that the dance patrons are either sickly and dying or rich but unsophisticated. When dealing with the sickly, the higher the airs, the better. If you show a little conscience and compromise slightly, they will regard you as a bargain-basement item with no one interested in you, discarding you like worn-out shoes. The dying ones fundamentally cannot tell good from bad, simply echoing what others say. The rich ones won't make a sound unless you knock them. The unsophisticated ones are willing to make any sacrifice before signing. Afterwards, they are ruthless and recognize no relatives. Therefore, to expect them to treat people with sincerity is probably more than trying to find gold in sand, almost like fishing for the moon in the sea. Dance patrons say that the dancers are all fickle and inconstant, only knowing how to cherish silver dollars, which is considered top-notch. Being able to recognize customers who spend large amounts of money is even more top-notch. This sounds a bit too extreme, but in fact, most dancers forget that their youth lasts only a short seven or eight years. Therefore, the money they earn comes in easily and goes out just as quickly, spent on meaningless things. Therefore, even holding a stone, there is a day when it can be polished smooth, but trying to polish out the true feelings of a dancer is probably even harder than a stone. Truly, there are reasons for everything.

Finally, let's talk about our amateur opera circles. Some emphasize careful wording and detailed study, saying that the reason why amateurs are superior to professionals is precisely this. Some do not ask about principles but diligently practice, saying that the most important thing is to perform well on stage. Some say that we don't make money at all, so there's no need to delve into theory or practice skills. Just grasp a few lines of lyrics, play a role, and enjoy ourselves on stage. Isn't that great? Some say that performing on stage is not enjoyable at all. If you don't like studying, why spend money to suffer? Truly, there are reasons for everything.

In short, there is only one correct principle, but eighteen incorrect ones. As for which one is the correct principle, it is up to you to judge.

### Brief Review of Tan Fuying and Other Performers (Part 2)

In the section before climbing the city gate, the tempo is "tightened up then relaxed." The "dao" character in "zhi jiao lao jun sao jie dao" suddenly shines with brilliance, high, bright, and full of strength, unmatched by others. This is the inheritance of Yingxiu, truly superb. The line "Wo ben shi Wolonggang san dan de ren" (I am originally a leisurely person from Wolonggang) is extremely good, not from the Yu School. The "ren" character is sung at a high pitch. The "baoding qiankun" (secure the universe) adds a "le" after the "ding" character. After "xia Nanyang" (go to Nanyang), the "yang" character changes to a weak "pin" sound, not in accordance with Yingxiu's old rules. The tempo of Er Liu is generally the same, receiving the most applause. People praise its elegance, but I find it too flowery. In Zhan Su (Killing Su), the use of a high pitch in "nan xiao hen" (difficult to dispel hatred) is also not easy. Although this play by Fuying is largely perfect, it inevitably has minor flaws. No one else can sing it to this extent. Shuyan has not been able to sing it for a long time, and Jupeng's singing style has changed. Fuying must be allowed to dominate. The Catching and Releasing Cao starts from the Guandi Hall. The singing of Chen Gong in the Guandi Hall is an old tune. I once learned it from the old performers Chen Fusheng and Wang Yufang. Now, listening to Fuying, he has changed the old tune. The ending Allegro becomes "tightening up then relaxing," I don't know who started this trend. In Killing Home, the line "xia de wo san hun qi po mang" (frightened my three souls and seven spirits) is very good. The tempo of the section "Chen Gong xin zhong si dao zha" (Chen Gong's heart is like being stabbed by a knife) is too fast. In the scene of killing Lu, the "gong" in "Chen Gong" uses the original pitch in a croaking tone, muffled and not bright. The "jia" in "ni yi jia da xiao" (your entire family) is unusually high and resonant, like a unique peak protruding, soaring into the sky, extremely brilliant, truly powerful, unmatched by others. The section "ting ta yan" (listen to his words) has a good domestic tone, but the enunciation is not correct. Adding a "ya" character after "qin jie yu ta" (diligently solve it for him) uses Shuyan's singing method, which is not good. The line "yi lun ming yue" (a round bright moon) is entirely the same as Shuyan's singing method. The "xia" character uses a florid tone, which feels lacking in calmness. It is best to adhere to Tan's method. In the final scattered beat, the "cha" character in "zuo shi cha" (doing things poorly) uses the "diao shang" mode, which proves that he still has strength to spare, which is commendable.

Other performers such as Ha Baoshan, who plays Wang Ping in Empty City and Lü Boshe in Catching and Releasing, give it their all, counting as the best of the best. Wang Quankui plays Sima Yi in the Empty City and Cao Cao in Catching and Releasing, with Cao Cao being better. In particular, the singing in the Guandi Hall scene is truly rooted and organized. Among the Jing roles with a high-pitched voice, this person is undoubtedly the best. If his voice were louder, he could rival Jin Shaoshan. Ye Shengmao's performance as Ma Su in Empty City, especially his face, is excellent. He also has a good voice and can become a famous Jing in the future. Ci Ruiquan's Chou role is one of the few remaining. It's a pity that I saw him performing with various famous actors in Chunming during the early Republic of China. Now, more than twenty years later, he first played the messenger three times in Empty City. Few people recognized him, but when he changed to playing the old soldier, people began to notice him. However, he is already very old, and his voice cannot resonate loudly. Ji Yanfen and Chen Lifen play the Dongfang sisters in Rainbow Pass, with excellent figures and eyebrows. Their performance is also experienced, and their appearance is quite similar to Zhu Qinxin. Jiang Miaoxiang often comes to Shanghai, which is universally appreciated and will not be repeated here.

### Lane Houses on Stage

— Feifei

The Performance of "Under the Eaves of Shanghai"

This is the latest attempt by playwright Xia Yan. It is a new expression technique never before used on the Chinese drama stage. "Under the Eaves of Shanghai," which depicts the life of Shanghai people, has changed its set design from separate scenes to three-dimensional. What appears here is a lane house in a working-class area, and this lane house is directly blasted onto the stage. The parlor, kitchen, pavilion room, front building, back building, and three-story loft are all faithfully placed in front of the audience. The audience is like living in this lane house, seeing the activities of everyone in this house. Here there is the sorrow of unemployment, the pain of unrequited love, the life of prostitutes, and the ups and downs of life. What is expressed here is completely reality.

Xia Yan originally wrote this script for well-equipped amateur theater groups. Due to the interruption of amateur activities because of the war, this new type of play has not been able to be performed by small theater groups with insufficient strength. This time, the Shanghai Drama Society finally began this most difficult task. Taking the set design as an example, the original set designers could not complete it and hired an architectural engineer to build it. The scale of the project and the amount of money spent are self-evident. "Under the Eaves of Shanghai" will be performed next Tuesday. The uniqueness of this play will inevitably attract people's attention.
