### Britain's Attitude Becomes Increasingly Firm: Continues to Arrest Japanese Residents in the Far East; Five People Detained in Singapore, Burma, and Hong Kong; Shigemitus Visited the British Foreign Minister to Formally Demand Release

London, Last night, a number of Japanese residents were arrested in various British Straits Settlements and parts of Burma for violating various national defense laws. Currently, the number of British residents arrested in Japan has decreased to seven or five. The Japanese Embassy announced last night that four more Japanese residents were arrested by the British authorities late last week, along with one Japanese person in Singapore and three others detained in Rangoon. The Japanese Embassy further stated that three weeks before Japan began arresting British residents, three Japanese residents had already been detained by the British authorities. Japanese sources reported last night that the Japanese Ambassador to London, Mamoru Shigemitsu, may visit British Foreign Minister Halifax again today to inquire about the details of the Japanese residents' arrests. It is said that Shigemitsu will formally demand their release "unless the British side can provide sufficient proof." Japanese sources stated that the Japanese Ambassador was not entirely satisfied with the British argument that the arrest of Japanese residents was unrelated to the arrest of British residents in Japan on suspicion of espionage. It is reported that Shigemitsu has sent a detailed report of his conversations with the British Foreign Minister to Tokyo and is awaiting instructions. When Shigemitsu spoke with Halifax last Saturday, he did not demand the release of the arrested Japanese residents; he only questioned the reasons for the arrests. The Japanese Embassy announced that the three Japanese residents detained in Rangoon were detained by the British authorities on Friday evening. The Japanese Embassy stated that the Japanese residents detained in Rangoon were all "businessmen." (United Press dispatch of the 5th)

Singapore, The British arrest of foreigners suspected of espionage has now extended to the Far East. Kobayashi Sekiro, the manager of the "Oriental News Agency" run by the Japanese, was arrested at his residence yesterday. At the same time, although Singapore was declared by Japan last week to be within the scope of the new "Greater East Asia" doctrine, it remains very calm. The Singapore "Street Times" commented yesterday, "The Japanese are currently in a dream of ruling Asia. They may be complacent now, but the dream will eventually be shattered, and they will eventually have a headache." Commenting on Japan's statement last week, the newspaper said, "The statement is based on Japan's mistaken belief that Japan can resolve the Sino-Japanese War at any time it wishes and act as the arbitrator of the Far East." A reporter inspected various locations yesterday and saw anti-aircraft artillery positions densely set up. Indian, Malay, and British troops were also crowded on the roads. Europeans drafted into the army continue to train here, even on weekends. At the same time, the volunteer army has also been undergoing rigorous training since July 8th. The people's self-defense organization has also achieved good results in controlling food. Air raid prevention training is also continuing. There will be three nights of complete blackout in early September for practice. (United Press dispatch of the 5th)

Hong Kong, According to a telegram from Rangoon, three Japanese residents in Burma were detained by the authorities at 7:00 PM on Friday. One was a Japanese businessman named Okaku, one was the manager of a private company named Furuta, and the other was named Kokubo. Kobayashi, the branch director of the Japan Alliance News Agency in Singapore (also the president of the Oriental News Agency and a businessman in Burma), was arrested by three detectives at 6:30 AM on Sunday. His residence was also searched. According to news from Singapore, the detectives have not yet explained the reasons for Kobayashi's arrest. It is expected that Kobayashi may be deported. Since the beginning of this month, the number of Japanese residents arrested in British territory on suspicion of espionage has reached six, and this is the first time that Japanese residents have been arrested outside the British Isles.

Japan's Official Stance Remains Silent: Awaiting Reports from Various Embassies and Consulates

Hong Kong, Tokyo dispatch, Although the comments in various newspapers here are extremely agitated regarding the British arrest of Japanese residents in London, Singapore, and Hong Kong, the spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs remained silent. When answering inquiries at a press conference today, he only said that the matter is not being discussed at this time, but is awaiting the official reports from Shigemitsu Kui's negotiations with Foreign Minister Halifax, as well as the negotiations between the Japanese Embassy and consulates in various locations with the British side. The specific charges against the Japanese residents arrested in London, Singapore, Hong Kong, and other places, especially the charges against the Japanese residents arrested in Hong Kong, are completely unknown. When reporters asked whether the government would adopt a policy to prevent the further deterioration of British-Japanese relations, the spokesman replied that he could not say for sure. When reporters asked whether Britain was cooperating with Japan regarding the closure of the Burma Road, the spokesman pointed out that Britain's permission to close the Burma Road for the transportation of military supplies began on July 18th, and it has only been two weeks.

Konoe Visited the Emperor Yesterday Morning; People in Tokyo, Osaka, and Other Places Held Anti-British Meetings

Tokyo, Representatives from various groups in Osaka City held a special meeting today and passed a resolution stating, "We demand the elimination of the forces of violent Britain." After the resolution was delivered to the British Consul General, it was telegraphed to the British Ambassador Craigie. The meeting also decided to urge the government to adopt a tough stance against Britain regarding the arrest of Japanese residents and decided to hold anti-British mass rallies in major cities such as Tokyo. At the same time, the directors of the Kobe Chamber of Commerce also passed a resolution requesting Britain to reconsider its attitude and requesting the ministers of the Navy, Army, and Commerce to advance Japan's position on the matter. Prime Minister Konoe had an audience with the Emperor this morning. (Reuters dispatch of the 5th)

Japanese Navy, Army, and Foreign Ministers Hold Meeting to Review Arrest of Residents Incident

Tokyo According to semi-official Japanese sources, observers close to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs claim that if the situation of the British arrest of Japanese residents deteriorates, the Japanese government has fully decided to take severe measures. The Asahi Shimbun reported that Foreign Minister Matsuoka has decided to lodge a strong protest with Britain, demanding the immediate release of all arrested Japanese residents and guaranteeing that there will be no more illegal arrests. The newspaper also stated that the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that if Britain does not show sincerity in this matter, Japan will abandon continued diplomatic negotiations and take a "serious political action." The meeting of the Navy, Army, and Foreign Ministers this afternoon has been confirmed, but it is said that no decision was reached. According to a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the meeting was routine in nature and reviewed all aspects of the incident and agreed to defer a decision pending more detailed information. According to official Japanese telegrams received here, a total of nine Japanese residents living in the British Empire have been arrested to date, including three in Rangoon and one each in Singapore and Hong Kong. It is reported that the Japanese residents arrested in Rangoon were all businessmen, while the one detained in Hong Kong was a cotton cloth merchant named Yamaguchi. The Japanese Consul in Hong Kong is said to have protested to the Hong Kong authorities. (Reuters dispatch of the 5th)

Tokyo, According to the Yomiuri Shimbun, the Army, Navy, and Foreign Ministries held a special meeting today to consider the British and British Empire's arrest of Japanese residents. It is expected that the meeting will have "important" results. While officials have not yet provided clear guidance, the comments made by Japanese newspapers when publishing the arrest news remain relatively cautious. Although various parties are clamoring for "action," there is currently no indication of what kind of action is desired or what kind of action will be implemented. However, the atmosphere remains tense. (Reuters dispatch of the 5th)

Rome Attaches Importance to the British-Japanese Incident: Japan Will Move Closer to Germany and Italy

London, The release of British people arrested in Japan is continuing. According to telegrams received by the Japanese Embassy last night, James Sandford Leach and Ali, four people, have been released. James is the manager of Molon Trading Company in Kobe, and Sandford is a merchant in a certain place in Korea who also serves as the chairman of the Kobe and Osaka Chambers of Commerce and the honorary consul of Sweden. As for Ellis, the general manager of Asahi Oil Company in Yokohama, there was news last week that he had been released at the same time as five other British people. Japanese newspapers believe that the detention of two famous Japanese businessmen in Britain was an act of retaliation by Britain for Japan's detention of British people. However, people here declare that the two events are completely unrelated. Britain has the desire to maintain friendly relations with Japan, so there has been no action. At the same time, it also agreed to temporarily close the Burma Road to show its willingness to improve the atmosphere between the two countries. However, the true value of this gesture does not seem to be understood by Japan, and thus rhetoric hostile to Britain as an enemy country suddenly arose. (Reuters dispatch of the 5th)

Rome Attaches Importance to the British-Japanese Incident: Japan Will Move Closer to Germany and Italy

Rome, Political figures here last night viewed the recent British-Japanese incident as likely to have a serious impact on the future relations between Britain and Japan, which may bring Japan closer to the Rome-Berlin Axis. Well-informed Italian sources said last night that Japan could also use the British-Japanese incident to sever diplomatic relations with Britain. The Italian side also felt that any hope of the London authorities repairing Britain's relations with Japan in the Far East had been dashed. Britain has major interests in Singapore and Hong Kong. Most Italian observers here predict that Japan's attitude towards Britain will inevitably become stronger, and Japan's attitude towards the Rome-Berlin Axis will become more friendly. Observers here recalled the news that the all-powerful nations such as Germany, the Soviet Union, Italy, and Japan agreed to economic cooperation in the hope of crushing the British economy. The recent British-Japanese incident will enable Japan to join the four-nation economic cooperation plan, so that the Soviet Union can replace Britain as the main customer of Japanese goods. Observers also suggested that the Japanese can find ways to improve Soviet-Japanese relations in the Far East, based on mutual anti-British sentiments, to suit the position of the Rome-Berlin Axis. Roman newspapers, including the Italian People's Daily, published telegrams from Tokyo yesterday, implying that Japan will take definite retaliation against the British authorities' arrest of nine Japanese residents, including a naval and land blockade of Hong Kong to completely isolate Hong Kong. It is widely rumored here that the British-Japanese incident will give Japan an excuse to take tough action against British commercial interests in China. Some people feel that the British-Japanese incident may be a prelude to Japan's severing diplomatic relations with Britain, so that Tokyo will have greater freedom in dealing with British-Japanese issues in the Far East by "direct methods." Italian observers, including Geda, the mouthpiece of Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, all view the British-Japanese incident as further isolating Britain in other parts of the world. Italian newspapers unanimously ridiculed Britain's "great isolationism" yesterday. The Rome People's Daily stated, "The British government's order to arrest famous Japanese residents is undoubtedly a retaliation against Japan. The British government has only one goal, which is to make all countries in the world oppose Britain. Has Intelligence Minister Cooper said that Britain's best bet is to fight alone? We can be sure that the British can achieve that enjoyable isolation, but we cannot be sure that the British are extremely fond of isolation." (United Press dispatch of the 5th)

The Chinese Side Welcomes the British Attitude: Pays Attention to Japan's Future Actions

Chongqing, People on the Chinese side here have expressed welcome for the stronger attitude taken by Britain in dealing with Japan, as shown by the British and other parts of the Empire's arrest of Japanese residents. They are now watching closely to see what means Tokyo will take to deal with Britain's recent actions. According to the opinion of people on the Chinese side, Britain's actions may only be a test of the new diplomatic policy of the Konoe Cabinet to see whether Japan is truly joining the Axis countries to deal with Britain or is simply pressing Britain to make greater concessions in the Far East. It is generally believed that the arrest of Japanese residents in London may accelerate Japan's actions in the Far East and may take immediate action to deal with British interests in the Far East, such as seizing the British Concession in Tianjin or attacking Hong Kong and the Shanghai Public Concession, which may result in a rapid international development in the Far East. Recalling the reasons why London expressed concessions to Japanese pressure, it was said that because Britain had not yet obtained a guarantee of active assistance from the United States, it could not call Japan's bluff. Therefore, Britain's recent actions have given rise to speculation as to whether the United States has given such a guarantee, especially given the recent US embargo on oil, scrap iron, and aircraft oil.

Editorial

### Prospects for British-Japanese Tension

Relations between Britain and Japan have suddenly become strained recently: and the repercussions have not yet subsided, and there is a view that they will become more acute. This is another very important link in the overall international situation, and it is something that deserves attention. Because last week, the Japanese authorities, under the pretext of investigating foreign espionage, arrested a large number of British residents, resulting in one person falling to his death; British public opinion was agitated, and some advocated retaliation. In the past three days, the British authorities in London, as well as various territories such as Singapore, the Straits Settlements, Burma, and Hong Kong, have arrested Japanese residents on the grounds of violating various regulations related to national defense. As of yesterday, ten people have been arrested. The British authorities claim that the matter is a routine affair and not retaliation. How strongly this stimulates the Japanese government and the public is naturally within the expectations of the British side, but the British side did it resolutely. The United States views this as a strengthening of the British attitude, an unexpected expression. Is this also unexpected for the Japanese?

Since the outbreak of the European War, Britain has been seeking peace and compromise with Japan; whatever Japan has asked for, it has disregarded domestic and foreign criticism and condemnation, and even discarded international morality, treaty obligations, in order to accommodate Japan; such as the concession of the Chinese silver deposit issue in the British Concession in Tianjin, and the agreement to temporarily suspend transportation to China through Burma, which are the most prominent examples. Japan then regarded Britain as despicable, and anti-British movements were often high. After Konoe formed his cabinet, he became even more contemptuous of Britain; when talking about national policy, he hinted at excluding it from East Asia; when talking about diplomacy, he listed his wishes for Germany, Italy, the United States, and the Soviet Union, but did not mention Britain; and the government-controlled media openly criticized it and compared it to an enemy country; Konoe took office for only two weeks and did nothing else, but first arrested British residents. This newspaper has previously argued that Japan is also in a state of hesitation regarding international relations, and that arresting British residents is to test the reactions of both Britain and Germany; it also stated that how Britain responds depends on how Britain assesses its own national strength and honor; and now, regardless of whether Britain does not regard the arrest of Japanese residents as a retaliatory action,

Given the impermanence of international changes and the dangerous and treacherous situation in recent years, no one can say for sure how the deterioration of British-Japanese relations will end. As for the various statements sung by the Japanese side yesterday and today; recalling the ambassador to Britain, severing diplomatic relations with Britain; taking effective means and taking swift action; dealing with violence with violence; and as the Italian newspapers reported from Tokyo, saying that Hong Kong would be blockaded simultaneously from the sea and land. All of these are extremely common; even if the Japanese reaction is even stronger than this, it should not be regarded as unexpected. However, observing the overall situation, British-Japanese relations have probably not yet reached a critical moment of determination. From the British side's point of view: during the negotiations on the Burma transportation suspension issue, and after the agreement was signed, it continued to withdraw women and children from Hong Kong, which shows that it has long been wary of Japan and shows its determination not to make any more concessions; this time, knowing that the Japanese side would definitely have a strong reaction, it still arrested Japanese residents, which is definitely not because the defense regulations were suddenly strictly implemented, nor is it because Japanese residents in various places suddenly violated the regulations at the same time, and it can also be seen that Britain has reached a point where it can no longer make concessions and can no longer tolerate what the Konoe Cabinet has expressed. No more concessions, no more tolerance, but how can there be any active action? On the eve of Germany and Italy's all-out preparations to attack Britain, Britain is eager to do so; therefore, Britain will regard the dispute over the arrest of residents as an independent issue that can be ended at any time, and although it has a strong suspicion of being a major retaliation in terms of meaning and action, it will definitely stop at just this retaliation. In other words, unless Britain encounters some new pressure, new insults, or new provocations from the Japanese side again, it will definitely remain in a state of observation and at the same time be on guard.

From the Japanese side's point of view; the significance of arresting British residents lies in the dual test of pro-German and contempt for Britain, but outsiders have no way of knowing which of the two is more important subjectively. If we analyze them separately, the focus is on the test of contempt for Britain, then Japan is currently suffering from the inability to end its aggression against China and has no energy to challenge Britain. Therefore, today, when Britain has shown that it has indeed reached the point of being unable to tolerate it, Japan is also afraid of making any more factual insults against Britain, and only engages in empty talk and diplomatic offensives, which it cannot help but do. If the focus is on the test of pro-German sentiment, then just this issue of arresting residents is probably not enough to be a pledge to gain Germany's trust, let alone that Britain's reaction is stronger than ever, which makes the Japanese even more discolored. Then, within the limits of not challenging Britain, Japan must take further steps in order to be happily nodded at by Germany? Is Japan prepared? Will it act decisively? It is not to say that there will definitely be no such day, but it is not something to talk about now; why is that? Because Japan today still cannot challenge Britain. Japan will fight Britain either after the end of the Sino-Japanese War or after Britain's great defeat against Germany.

The situation of the British and Japanese sides, unless there are any new actions by the United States and the Soviet Union, or if they have some new impact, is roughly like this, so it is said that the relationship between the two countries has not yet reached an important moment of determination. The length of the period from today until the conditions for determination are fully prepared is unknown. During this period, if Britain can grasp this last juncture where no more concessions can be made and no more tolerance is possible, then although the dispute over the arrest of residents is like this, the wind of threats and intimidation may be slightly reduced!

### The Passing of Commander Zhong Yi

Chongqing, During the previous battle in southern Henan and northern Hubei, which resulted in a great victory, the Chinese army's General Zhang Zizhong and Commander Zhong Yi heroically defended the country and died heroically. Their great integrity and heroic spirit are admired and mourned by the world.

Commander Zhong's name is Yi, his style name is Tianren, and he is from Funan County, Guangxi. He was born in the late Qing Dynasty and, feeling the chaotic state of the country, abandoned his pen to join the army. In the ninth year of the Republic of China, he graduated from the Shaoguan Military Academy and then served as a commander and battalion commander. In the thirteenth year of the Republic of China, he assisted Li Bai in establishing Guangxi. During the Northern Expedition, he served as the commander of the Third Regiment of the Seventh Army. In the eighteenth year of the Republic of China, he went to study abroad and returned to China to serve as the captain of the military training team at Guangxi University. In the twenty-third year of the Republic of China, he entered the Army University to study. After graduating, he served as the brigade commander of the 414th Brigade of the 31st Army. During the July 7th Incident, the general led his troops and fought between Jiang, Zhe, Wan, and E. He was promoted to the commander of the ××× Division for his meritorious service and was awarded the rank of Lieutenant General of the Army. In this summer's Battle of Henan and Hubei, the line of Suizao was fiercely fought. The general led the brave men of the entire army, braving arrows and stones, and personally went to the front line. Eventually, due to the disparity in numbers, he died heroically at the age of forty-one. His wife, Ms. Li Huilan, is knowledgeable and literary, and they are a very loving couple.

### The Burma Road After the Embargo

Chongqing According to an official from the Ministry of Transportation, this year's rainy season will have little impact on the use of the Burma Road. After a year of constant improvements, the road is now quite resistant to harsh weather conditions. There are various reasons to believe that in the remaining rainy season, traffic will not be hindered. The Ministry of Transportation allocated 10 million yuan after last year's rainy season to enhance the road's construction. Today, it can be guaranteed to be reasonably safe and usable. It is expected that even if the road is blocked by landslides, it can be repaired and reopened to traffic in at most one day. Although the import of certain goods on the Burma Road has been stopped by the British authorities, traffic is still continuing. The import of other goods, such as chemical and pharmaceutical supplies, continues as usual. The export of Chinese goods, such as tung oil, has not been interfered with. (5th Reuters dispatch)

Chongqing This morning, the Ta Kung Pao published a special article by Zhang Zhongxian, a famous Chinese international affairs writer. The article stated that the conclusion of the British-Japanese Burma Road agreement may not necessarily represent any change in British Far East policy, and its impact may not be serious. However, we should pay attention to what the British policy will be like after three months. The British concessions have the following limitations: (1) The validity period of this agreement is limited to three months. (2) This period coincides with the rainy season. The British position in the Far East must be determined by three factors in the international situation: 1. The success or failure of Germany's blitzkrieg strategy against Britain; 2. The results of the US presidential election in November; 3. The results of Britain's attempts to improve Anglo-American relations. The outcome of the Anglo-German war has only the following three possibilities: (1) Britain is defeated by Germany; (2) The war enters a prolonged stalemate; (3) Germany collapses due to the failure of the blitzkrieg strategy and the success of the British blockade. Except for the first of the above possibilities, if any development falls within the scope of the other two possibilities, then the future British Far East policy may not undergo any changes. If the United States, after the presidential election in November (regardless of whether the Democratic or Republican Party wins), will give Britain continued assistance and adopt a more active stance in the Far East, it seems that the United Kingdom and the United States will take close parallel actions in the Far East. At present, the Soviet Union's policy in Europe is not very clear, but it can be determined that it will not join the German side in the war. Therefore, Anglo-Soviet relations are unlikely to worsen further. Moreover, even if Britain is unfortunately defeated, the Far East policies of the United States and the Soviet Union seem likely to continue along their current lines. Germany's position outside the Pacific is unlikely to intervene. Even if Germany joins the Pacific region, it can be asserted that Germany is doing this for its own benefit rather than for Japan. Although we can lament Britain's violation of international law and its solemn promises regarding the Burma Road, we still hope that Britain will find a way to remedy this situation as soon as possible.

### Opening of the Pearl River Under Negotiation

Hong Kong The issue of navigation on the Pearl River has not yet been resolved, so the restoration of normal traffic between Hong Kong and Guangdong has been temporarily delayed. The Hong Kong authorities denied knowing the entire event, only saying that negotiations are in progress. The Japanese Consul-General stated that the Pearl River may not be fully opened, which confirms that the negotiations have not been successful or at least have not ended. The Japanese in Guangdong seem to hope to use the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway as a maritime transport line more than they hope for the opening of the Pearl River. It is reported from Shaoguan that the Japanese army is now trying to open the section of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway from Shenzhen to Shilong on the East River. The Japanese army outside the border of Hong Kong has increased from one thousand to three thousand, stationed near Bao'an. It is said that after further reinforcements, they will attack the Chinese army along the railway to the north. Recently, the Chinese side bombed Shenzhen, and the Japanese army suffered more than 30 casualties, so the Japanese army will also retaliate. However, the Chinese army is unwilling to engage the Japanese army in Shenzhen because it is too close to Hong Kong. If the Japanese army fires artillery from the north, the shells may fall south of the Japanese army's front line (i.e., Hong Kong). According to reliable sources, the Chinese army will not attack until the Japanese army advances north. (5th International News Agency dispatch)

### Chinese Returning to Guangdong from Hong Kong Settled Separately

### Central Party, Government, and Military Hold Joint Memorial Week

Chongqing In the morning of the 5th, the central party, government, and military held a joint memorial week. Wang Quansheng reported on the party affairs in the Philippines, and then talked about Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings, saying that when Dr. Sun Yat-sen went north in the thirteenth year of the Republic (1924), he said, "I am entering Beijing this time not for power or position, but to save the country." I personally have many feelings about this point. We should serve the party and the country, and we should implement Dr. Sun Yat-sen's intention. Therefore, no matter which comrade is in which position, in which department, or in charge of which organization, we must not work for power or position, but to save the country. However, to do the work of saving the country, we must have a considerable spirit of sacrifice. We know that Dr. Sun Yat-sen had the greatest spirit of sacrifice when he went north. Now, if we can have this spirit to serve the country, I believe that everything can be successful, and we will be able to complete the revolutionary mission of our party. (5th dispatch)

### Chinese Perspectives on Soviet Foreign Minister's Speech

Chongqing Local Chinese sources have expressed dissatisfaction with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's speech, especially the section referring to Soviet-Japanese relations.

The Xinhua Daily, however, defended the Soviet Union's foreign policy, saying that its policy strictly adheres to neutrality and peace. The newspaper also elaborated on the importance of Sino-Soviet friendship and advocated closer Sino-Soviet relations. (3rd Reuters dispatch)

Chongqing Today's Central Daily News published an article commenting on Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's speech and expressed satisfaction with the following points: (1) The Soviet Union's resolute adherence to neutrality in the European war; (2) The Soviet Union's suspicion of Japanese friendship, and the fact that it did not clearly express its relations with Britain and the United States, kept Japan in constant doubt; (3) The Soviet Union reiterated its sympathy and goodwill towards China. Ta Kung Pao also strongly stated that the expression of friendly relations between Japan and the Soviet Union is not to be trusted, especially since Konoe and his government, the young officers of the Japanese military, and various industrialists are all strong anti-communist elements.

### Chongqing Air Defense Headquarters Warns Citizens to Pay Attention During Air Raids

Chongqing The Air Defense Headquarters here issued a warning because residents of Chongqing flocked to the south bank of the Yangtze River during air raids, hoping that they would not over-believe the so-called safe zones announced by the Japanese side. It is said that Japanese aircraft have bombed them several times in the past, and pointed out that although the Japanese side advised residents to evacuate outside the city to locations some distance away from the city, all nearby towns in Chongqing, such as Hechuan, Tongliang, Guang'an, Qijiang, Beifu, and others, have been successively attacked by Japanese aircraft. Therefore, the authorities urged residents to take shelter in the countryside during air raids, or in air-raid shelters in the city.

### First World War Anniversary British Air Force Intensifies Activity German Synthetic Oil Plant Bombed and Catching Fire British West Coast Under Air Raid Threat

London Yesterday was the 26th anniversary of Britain's participation in the First World War. The British Air Force intensified its attacks on Germany. Germany's Kiel port tank center, railways, and airfields were all subjected to large-scale and fierce air raids. However, Germany's offensive against Britain has been the most moderate since the continuous bombing that began on June 18. Some quarters here believe that the reduction in German activity is a sign that Hitler is about to launch the long-awaited blitzkrieg. (5th International News Agency dispatch)

London The British Air Force flew to Germany, the Netherlands, and France on Saturday and Sunday to launch large-scale attacks on military targets in order to demonstrate its power. According to the Ministry of Aviation, some of Germany's most important sources of synthetic oil were attacked by British bombers on the night of August 3. Part of the oil plant in the Monheim area was bombed and caught fire. The British aircraft that arrived later found the target by following the light of the fire. The Politz oil plant was also hit by bombs. The enemy has strengthened its local defenses since the first attack. Therefore, in addition to firing at British aircraft going to attack Britain, they also fired dense bombardments of flares dropped by British aircraft. The British aircraft were not hit, but some of the flares were shot down. Other British aircraft were not hindered by poor visibility and managed to find the Kiel dockyards, where they immediately dropped bombs. Naval buildings caught fire. Buildings and airfields in the Hesen area, west of Kiel, were also damaged. In addition, a British aircraft flew to the north of Cologne and circled over a large warehouse for about an hour before dropping high-explosive bombs and incendiary bombs. A seaplane base was also bombed by British aircraft. During the day, British aircraft attacked the Hipol and Hanstede airfields in the Netherlands, the oil pools in Rotterdam, and the railway traffic in the Ruhr and Rhineland areas. Another British bomber flew to Abbeville, bombed a storage area, and swooped down to 50 feet to strafe troops and truck convoys. A列裝甲火車 between Gravelines and Dunkirk, and ships in the canal near Gravelines, were all bombed by British aircraft. Three British aircraft did not return. Yesterday, two British fishing boats arrived at a certain port in Britain. According to reports, they shot down a German bomber in the English Channel. A Reuters reporter recently visited a night raid bomber station at a certain location of the North Command. The crew of the team has won the title of "Night Terror of Germany". According to the crew, the large-scale bombing by the British Air Force has forced the German side to concentrate its anti-aircraft gun defenses around the Ruhr and other areas, and distribute them elsewhere. The German anti-aircraft guns are indeed numerous, and there are even more searchlights. However, German fighter jets are still a mystery and are often encountered during night raids. The rumor that the German side has a large number of blocking balloons is actually a fabrication and not a fact. British aircraft have gradually become familiar with the ground defense countermeasures by adopting clever evasive gliding tactics during night raids, so British aircraft losses are very small. Therefore, new British pilots can take over the tasks of the original pilots, while the original pilots take on the task of guiding the newcomers. This development is very valuable. According to the detailed reports and intelligence of British aircraft observers, the German war machine has suffered a terrible blow. If the British side sends more aircraft to night raid Germany when necessary, the effect will be even greater. (5th Reuters dispatch)

Caron According to newspaper reports, the British Air Force bombed the area near the town of Gosenko in the Berghans area on the night of the 3rd. The bombs all fell in the forest and there was no damage. British aircraft also dropped several explosive bombs near Sywenhert, killing one cow. British aircraft dropped several bombs in Kayadenwald, all of which fell in the fields and there was also no damage. (5th Haitong dispatch)

Stockholm, Sweden Sources reliable to Norwegian people recently said that German officials currently stationed in Norway believe that the German army may start attacking Britain around August 8 and 10, and that Trondheim has stepped up the construction of fortifications and will become a "Northern Singapore." The entire southwest coast is also covered with anti-aircraft guns due to frequent air raids by British aircraft. (5th United Press dispatch)

Copenhagen British aircraft groups again dropped bombs and bombed various parts of Denmark on the night of the 3rd. According to news issued by the Danish official news agency, the damage was still light and there were no casualties. (5th Haitong News Agency dispatch)

London The Ministry of Aviation announced that three German fighter jets were shot down near the southeast coast of Britain this morning. One British aircraft is missing. (5th Reuters dispatch)

Berlin The German High Command issued a war report this afternoon stating that our reconnaissance aircraft sank a merchant ship yesterday 100 kilometers southwest of Pembroke in St. George's Channel, and flew reconnaissance missions over England and Scotland. Our aircraft attacked the dockyards in Sheerness, the gas stations and anti-aircraft gun positions near North Killingholme last night, and were extremely successful. Enemy aircraft bombed western Germany, killing one civilian and destroying one farmhouse. (5th Haitong News Agency dispatch)

Berlin Yesterday, the German military headquarters issued a war report stating that the German Air Force is focusing on reconnaissance work on the west coast of Britain. This move is noteworthy because the ports on the west coast of England, the Irish Sea, and the north are generally regarded as safer locations. Cities such as Glasgow, Carlisle, and Lancaster were within the range of German aircraft before the Norwegian war. Since then, the ports on the west coast have gradually become accessible. German aircraft can reach Glasgow in two hours, Liverpool in 100 minutes, and Bristol in one hour. German submarines are now active in the Irish Sea, so the danger to the commercial ports on the west coast of Britain is no different from that of the ports on the southeast coast.

### British Fleet Sails Back to Gibraltar

Madrid According to reports from Algeciras, the British fleet that left Gibraltar westward on Friday returned to port last night.

### Italian Troops in East Africa Deploy Strong Offensive Declare Will Seize the Suez Canal

Rome A certain Italian newspaper here predicted that the Italian army, navy, and air force in Libya will inflict "the most devastating blow" on Britain in Egypt and the Suez Canal. It is said that the Italian army has completed preparations for the most serious attack to seize the Suez Canal. This move will make all areas in Africa surrender to Britain, because Egypt and the Suez Canal are the center of British resistance. The Fascist rule newspaper predicted that Italy will also quickly capture Palestine, because according to history, the Italian royal family and the Roman Catholic Church should have the right to rule the holy land. (5th International Alliance dispatch)

Rome The Italian military headquarters issued a war report this afternoon stating that enemy aircraft groups attempted to bomb Libyan troops near the Cyrenaica border. Our aircraft immediately engaged them in air combat and shot down ten enemy aircraft. A team of our bombers went to Marsa Matruh to bomb and shot down one enemy destroyer. Our aircraft all flew back to their original defenses safely. In East Africa, the enemy's attack on Lake Rudolf failed. Enemy aircraft bombed Massawa port, causing slight damage, killing four people and injuring thirty people. Two enemy aircraft were shot down by us. (5th Haitong News Agency dispatch)

Cairo It was reported today that two of the Italian aircraft that attacked Marsa Matruh in western Egypt today were badly damaged. British fighter jets took off to intercept them, and the Italian aircraft were forced to drop their bombs into the sea and escape. According to a British Air Force bulletin, British aircraft machine-gunned three Italian bombers parked on the ground at an altitude of 150 feet when they attacked the Daghba area. Today, British aircraft also attacked the port of Massawa and dropped bombs on parked submarines. One warship was directly hit. (5th Reuters dispatch)

Rome A military reporter for the Stefani news agency declared today that the increased activity of the Italian Air Force is part of a plan to destroy the entire British base in East Africa. Hayya is an important British air force base and a key point for Port Sudan to reach the hinterland of Anglo-Egyptian Sudan. Therefore, Italian aircraft are constantly bombing it. Although the British side is firing dense anti-aircraft guns, the railway there was still destroyed by our aircraft. Sammit is also an important location. The British airfield has been hurriedly expanded. When the first team of Italian aircraft went to bomb it, they encountered interception by British aircraft, but they were immediately dispersed by our aircraft and rushed into the bombing, and the hangars caught fire and were destroyed on the spot. (5th Haitong dispatch)

Rome Yesterday, the Haitong correspondent in Rome received detailed information on the fighting of the Italian army on the 3,000-kilometer front line on the Egyptian border, stating that although the war in the Nile River basin is restricted by the rainy season, the war in Kenya is proceeding fiercely. After occupying Dula and several important highways, the Italian army concentrated its forces to attack the most important British fortress, Moyale. The fortress was subsequently occupied by the Italian army, and the avenue leading to Nairobi, the capital of Kenya, was opened to the Italian army. The Italian army advanced along the villages on the plain, which are irrigation stations on the arid plains, with only a few families living there. The British army built fortresses in important villages. The headquarters of the British army is located in Wena, and the Italian army has arrived outside the village and sent aircraft to bomb it. Wajir in northeastern Kenya, where the British army has aircraft hangars and fortresses, has been heavily bombed. Soon, the German army's attack on Britain from the Arctic Circle will echo the Italian army's operations in the equator. (5th Haitong dispatch)

### Japan's Demands on Vietnam: US Deeply Concerned, Will Strive to Prevent Japan from Obtaining Bases; Pétain Government Negotiating with Japan

Washington: Regarding the news that Japan is demanding naval bases in Vietnam, neither the State Department here nor other government officials have heard of it. However, this news has made US officials eager to find out the truth. Government officials did not predict what the US reaction would be if France were to grant Japan's demands. However, well-informed private sources said that based on the US's past attitude, the US would definitely oppose this action, as this action would fundamentally change the entire Southeast Asia, both militarily and politically. They also said that the US's opposition to any changes in the general status quo of the Dutch East Indies and the Far East is already on file in official archives. Although the US has no treaty basis for its concern for the territorial integrity of Vietnam, other due obligations will compel the US to use its power to prevent Japan from obtaining bases in Vietnam. Although Japan's direct purpose in demanding these bases is to defeat the forces of General Chiang Kai-shek, Japan can also use these bases to attack the Dutch East Indies and the Philippines. Military experts say that Japan's occupation of bases in Vietnam will make the Philippines, an important military base for the US to confront this aggressive Far Eastern enemy, lose its importance, and will also make the military fortress of Singapore lose its importance, and will threaten the waterway between British-controlled Hong Kong and Calcutta. The Dutch East Indies will face direct danger. Diplomatic observers say that if France grants Japan's demands, the US attitude towards France will definitely deteriorate, and relations with Japan will become even more strained. (5th United Press)

Vichy: Diplomatic circles claimed last night that the French Pétain government is conducting negotiations with the Japanese government regarding Japan's demand to establish naval and army bases in French Vietnam. The negotiations are currently underway simultaneously in Tokyo and Vichy. The two sides are also negotiating Japan's request to greatly increase trade between Japan and French Vietnam. Japan's demand to establish naval bases in Vietnam is based on the urgent need to end the Sino-Japanese war in southern China. Well-informed sources claim that Japan also wants to dump large quantities of Japanese goods in French Vietnam, while at the same time buying iron, coal, tin, and other raw materials from Vietnam. Detailed contents of the Franco-Japanese negotiations were impossible to ascertain last night. (5th United Press)

Tokyo: The Japanese Foreign Ministry has formally denied negotiating with French Ambassador to Japan, Henri, regarding the demand for Vietnam as a base. The Japanese Army Ministry also denied this news. However, according to news from Vichy, France, Japan and France are negotiating this matter. (5th United Press)

### US Congress Pays Attention to Far Eastern Problems; Some Members Advocate Worsening Relations with Japan

Washington: The United States has recently paid increasing attention to Far Eastern issues, but opinions are very complex on the point of whether to worsen relations with Japan. Utah Democratic Senator William King advocated breaking off relations with Japan and preparing for any changes. Kansas Republican Senator Capper advocated that the United States adopt a "gradual and cautious" policy to avoid being drawn into the Far Eastern war. Although most members of Congress held different views on President Roosevelt's foreign policy, they all unanimously advocated an embargo on aviation gasoline. New York Republican Congressman Fish said that the United States clearly has the right to refuse to sell military supplies to Japan. He said that he strongly supports the embargo on military supplies to Japan, but the most important thing at present is to avoid interfering in Far Eastern events. Florida Democratic Senator Pepper declared that the United States should continue to tighten its blockade against Japan and warned the United States not to adopt a policy of appeasement towards Japan. Indiana Democratic Senator Van Nuys said that the United States should be willing to abandon its interests in the Far East when necessary on the issue of Japan. Japan's policy is an aggressive policy with elements of cooperation with the German-Italian axis. The United States can very well worsen relations with Japan and must implement an absolute blockade against Japan. (5th United Press)

### US Takes Precautions in the Pacific; Embankment Connected to Japanese Factory to Be Cut Off by Government Order

San Jose, California: The US government has recently ordered the embankment connecting the Pacific area to the site of a Japanese cotton mill to be cut off. According to official explanations, the cutting off of this embankment is for the purpose of diverting water flow. However, reliable sources believe that this order is also a kind of precaution, planned to prevent the vast land on the other side of the embankment from being used for aviation, as US-Japan relations have recently become increasingly tense.

### Greek Ships Lose Forty Vessels

Athens: The loss of Greek merchant ships in July has been greatly reduced. Nine ships were sunk, totaling 33,544 tons. In June, 14 ships were lost, with a deadweight of 61,665 tons. The reason for the reduction is that Greek ships are mostly used for domestic shipping and not for trade with Britain. Since the outbreak of the war, Greek ships have lost a total of forty vessels, totaling 200,346 tons. (5th Huitong Electric)

### Madagascar Extends Territorial Waters; French Authorities Announce

The Enthusiasm had 10 officers missing, 1 sailor killed, and 143 missing. The Acasta had 1 officer killed and 1 died of injuries, with 6 injured. According to an Admiralty communiqué, the 590-ton British fishing vessel Cape Finisterre was lost in an engagement with enemy aircraft. The ship was attacked by four aircraft on the evening of August 2. One aircraft was shot down and the rest were damaged. The fishing vessel then sank. The relatives of the crew members who were killed or injured have been notified. In addition, the British Naval Air Force Swordfish aircraft operated in the western Mediterranean on the 1st and 2nd of this month, attacking the Cagliari airfield on the Italian island of Sardinia, bombing amidst fierce anti-aircraft fire, hitting four hangars, two of which caught fire and burned fiercely. Four aircraft on the ground were destroyed, and the airfield buildings were either destroyed or damaged. One British aircraft is missing, presumably lost, and another was forced to land on Sardinia. An Italian communiqué stated that the crew of the aircraft had been captured, and there were no other casualties. When the British aircraft were dispatched, British ships were also bombed by enemy aircraft, but the ships were not damaged and the crew members were not injured. One enemy aircraft was hit by anti-aircraft fire and is believed to have been unable to return to base. Three enemy aircraft attempting to attack British ships were shot down by British naval aircraft. (5th Reuters)

### Lindbergh Advocates Peace; Delivers Speech in Chicago

Chicago: In a speech delivered here yesterday, Colonel Lindbergh stated that if the United States does not want to be thrown into war, it should first advocate a peace plan based on the welfare of the United States and backed by a strong national defense. Colonel Lindbergh told 40,000 people in the vast "playground" that the plan should not involve the United States in European internal affairs. In accordance with the wishes of the United States, the United States does not want to be involved in internal affairs, and it has been so in the past and will be so in the future. When this hero who made an epoch-making non-stop flight from New York to Paris in 1927 appeared, the audience responded with thunderous applause. Lindbergh said, "Let us offer Europe a plan to improve and protect the Western Hemisphere. Regardless of their response, let us advance the destiny hoped for by our ancestors. If our ancestors knew that the front line was in Europe, I don't know what they would think." Lindbergh also asked, "If our ancestors knew that 130 million Americans knew that only the British fleet defended us from aggression, I don't know what they would think."

### British Military Training Director Discusses the British Spirit; Reveals Four Major Characteristics

London: British Military Training Director General Gort spoke on the British Broadcasting Corporation yesterday on the anniversary of the outbreak of the last war, saying that British strength has always been built on service to God, the nation, and humanity. Any great power that does not have this concept of service will not be able to last long. No country can survive for long without religious belief as the basis of its life. What we are engaged in today is not only a struggle to protect democracy, but also a sacred war to defend the religious principles that we have heard from our mothers since childhood. The Nazis also have their religion, which is a religion without God, which is based on material power rather than morality, and its concept is to disregard everything and regard human life as nothing. Although it achieves temporary advantages, the souls of the military and civilians on which the final victory depends have been killed. If the Nazis in Germany and Italy were to win, then the four major characteristics of the British soul, namely religious belief, love of freedom, patience, and respect for individual rights, would be completely wiped out. The goal of our war is to maintain these characteristics. As far as I have seen in the past few months, British youth are full of courage and ready to sacrifice everything for the sake of justice. With firm belief and divine assistance, we must remove this demon from the world. We will move forward with this spirit. (5th Reuters)

### European War Records (2) - A Tour of the Western European Front

The author of this article, John Fisher, is a Berlin-based correspondent for the American Life magazine. During the German offensive in Flanders, he accompanied the first group of correspondents with the army. He traveled through the Netherlands and Belgium to northern France, then along the English Channel to near Dunkirk. At that time, the Germans were bombarding the area, so he turned back into northern Belgium and arrived in Brussels. He reached Dunkirk a few hours after its fall. The original text is translated below:

The military correspondents from various newspapers traveled in seven high-speed military vehicles, departing from Cologne. The group crossed the Meuse River at Maastricht, a key town on the Belgian border. The bridges had been destroyed by the Belgian army, but German engineers had built two iron bridges within twenty-four hours. The German army had also posted notices in the city, warning residents not to leave their homes after 10 PM, to avoid being shot by patrols.

Along the Meuse River, refugees, young and old, were returning to their hometowns, while numerous German military vehicles sped forward at full speed. Food rations were already limited for the residents of Liège. As they approached Namur, the fighting became more intense. Landmines were frequently triggered along the way, so they avoided the main roads. Most of the houses north of Namur were completely destroyed.

Judging from the situation along the way, this war was being fought on the roads. German Messerschmitt bombers flew low along the roads, strafing Allied troops with machine guns, but most of the bombs did not hit the roads. South of Namur, I saw bomb craters stretching for miles on both sides of the road, 150 feet away. Although there were many shrapnel fragments on the road surface, there was no damage. A German officer told me, "Bombing the sides of the road is just as effective. Destroying the road would hinder our advance." The roads built by Belgium were exceptionally sturdy, allowing German mechanized units to speed along at 30 to 40 miles per hour without obstruction.

There were very few soldiers' graves along the road. The German army always buried its fallen soldiers within a few hours to prevent epidemics and avoid the surviving soldiers witnessing the tragic deaths of their comrades.

That evening, they drove through the Maginot Line. The defensive works there were centered on the town of Maubeuge, with strong trenches dug in front, and barbed wire and other obstacles placed in the streets. The Germans concentrated bombardment on it with a large number of tanks, aircraft, and mechanized infantry for three days. Finally, it was broken through by fifteen Stuka bombers within fifteen minutes. The town had 25,000 residents, and all the houses were reduced to rubble, but no street was bombed, showing the intensity and accuracy of the German bombardment.

Two elderly women were searching for furniture in the rubble. They told me that a bomb hit a church, killing fifty refugees. The two women were dazed and acting abnormally, showing the great terror and power of the German Stuka bombers. The bombs dropped by these bombers made a sharp, loud, ear-splitting noise. The stench and blood of the corpses filled the town, which a German officer called "the fragrance of battle."

Arriving in Châlons, they encountered 15,000 British and French prisoners, including a company of British Lancashire infantry. According to the company commander, the Germans attacked fiercely with 300 tanks and many heavy mortars, resulting in 25% casualties for the company. "This loss was due to poor command from headquarters. Otherwise, my brothers could have been moved in time." The army was suddenly put into battle and was not well-equipped, resulting in three days of marching under the scorching sun with a lack of food and water. However, the French army was very well-equipped and had tents.

The officer finally said, "In three days, we didn't see our air force once, and we didn't get a chance to fire a shot. When the German tanks approached, there was a chance to shoot, but the French officer was afraid that the British artillery fire would be inaccurate and mistakenly injure French infantry, so he forbade the bombardment." I asked what he thought of the German army. He replied, "The Germans fight well. My brothers didn't know how to deal with them. I will report to certain officials after I return home." The officer gripped his axe handle tightly, waving it as he spoke, "Everything is a mistake of the politicians!"

From my observation, the morale of the soldiers was still high, and their combat effectiveness was not bad, but the conditions of detention were discouraging. Four people shared only one loaf of bread. No wonder they scrambled for cigarettes and bread from us. Some of them were washing clothes by the riverbank, while others were making fires with branches to cook the remaining canned food.

The car passed through Arras, where the station and the city center had been destroyed by artillery fire. Continuing towards Boulogne, they saw thousands of Allied six-inch shells piled up along the way. British trucks, repainted, were used by the German army to transport supplies, traveling back and forth. Mixed in were motorcycle units with machine guns, and many trucks filled with infantry, marching forward with high spirits. The victors and the vanquished were truly in different worlds.

These German mechanized units sped at forty miles per hour, and there were no car wrecks along the way. I was very surprised and asked a German officer, "How do you do this?" He was shocked and replied, "Crashing cars is against military orders."

The docks in Boulogne were shattered, and all the warehouses were leveled. Allied supplies were scattered on the ground. There were also hundreds of barrels of wine, showing that the French army could not live without it for a day. They then drove along the coast, passing Calais and Saint-Omer to Cassel, which was located on high ground and had several cannons and anti-aircraft guns. Trucks and armored vehicles were everywhere. Ammunition, wine bottles, and canned food were piled up. There were even soccer shoes, targets, and other recreational toys in the garbage, showing that the British army had everything it needed on the coast, which was very different from the interior.

Bergues was the last defense area of Dunkirk. As we approached the area, we got out of the car and walked forward to scout the way. At that time, groups of German Stuka bombers were trying to break through the French anti-aircraft fire. We stopped to watch and saw shells bursting behind the aircraft, with small clouds of white smoke very close to the tail, but none hit.

Then they proceeded one after another along the railroad tracks. Entering Bergues, they saw trucks, cars, and other vehicles that had been hastily pushed into the road to create obstacles, but it was ineffective. The city gate was blocked by a giant American-made rotary snowplow, behind which was the leftover food left by the French machine gunners, who had retreated before finishing their meal. I squeezed into the city and saw nothing but ruins. German Stuka bombers and artillery had bombarded the city for four days, and none of the houses survived. In the rubble, the embers had not completely extinguished, and the smoke from the burnt wood and fabrics suffocated. Some churches were intact, while others had their spires destroyed. German shells still flew overhead from time to time, and the sound of French and German machine guns echoed on the ground. To the north, Dunkirk was burning, with thick smoke covering the sky.

Walking through the streets of Bergues, they saw residents crawling out of underground cellars everywhere. Two thousand people were trapped in the city during the six-day siege. They then saw a bombed-out French tank, next to which were several warhorses, grazing leisurely. The German army had captured enough cigarettes, chocolate, and other food to last for six months, and millions of rounds of ammunition.

The Germans were still fiercely bombarding Dunkirk, so they headed south from Bergues to Lille. The suburbs of the city were completely destroyed, but the city center was still intact. Near Arras, they saw thousands of French prisoners, surrounded by barbed wire and guarded by only one German soldier.

Late at night, they entered Brussels. Except for the bridges and radio station being destroyed, there was no other damage. The cafes along the road were thriving, with many German soldiers as customers. Trams and buses were running as usual. American-made cigarettes were becoming scarce. Bread purchases were restricted. The streets were all under German control. Although the residents were unhappy, the German soldiers behaved well, and there was peace between the victors and the conquered. As for the Belgian king's order to cease fire, Belgian public opinion could be summarized in one sentence: "Emotionally, it is inappropriate, but intellectually, it is approved."

The next morning, they headed north and spent the night in Ostend. At dawn, they proceeded towards Dunkirk along the coast. They saw German supply trains heading back to the rear, like long snakes. According to military sources, the battle of Dunkirk was almost over. Driving along the Moers Canal, they saw several barges burning in the canal, and Allied trucks lined up in the fields, stretching as far as the eye could see. Abandoned equipment and supplies filled the ditches. The French army had flooded the Moers Canal when retreating, and the area near Dunkirk was flooded, so German tanks could not be used and the attack had to be mainly carried out by infantry and artillery. German soldiers waded through the water, which was chest-deep.

Dunkirk had been fiercely bombed by German aircraft and artillery for seven days and nights. We arrived there a few hours after the surrender of the 40,000 French rearguard troops. I witnessed the most brutal destruction. No house was intact. The streets were piled with rubble several feet high. Refugees who had fled to the countryside soon returned. Large groups of German troops were heading south. An officer told me, "The battle here is over, and we are looking for new battlefields." I felt that the extreme destruction of the war was everywhere and there was nothing to stay for, so I drove back to Berlin with my travel companions.

### China Possesses Excellent Conditions, Victory Is Only a Matter of Time, The Mainland Is Full of Vigor and Belief Is Firm, Japanese Aircraft's Expensive Bombs Are Counterproductive, Comments from a French Diplomat after Traveling in the Mainland and Returning to Shanghai

According to a certain French ex-diplomat, who recently arrived in Shanghai from Free China, who told the Da Zhong News Agency yesterday, although the lives of the Chinese people on the mainland are quite difficult, their expectations and contributions to their motherland are increasing day by day. The person most admired the spirit of the Chinese people in sacrificing everything for the independence and freedom of their motherland. The following is an excerpt from their conversation:

Deep Impressions That Will Never Be Forgotten

Although I only traveled to Chongqing, Kunming, and other places away from Shanghai for a month or two, the impressions I gained will never be forgotten. When I arrived in Free China, it was during the time when Japanese aircraft were indiscriminately bombing all day long, intending to break the Chinese people's determination to resist. Therefore, every morning at nine o'clock and every afternoon at six o'clock, the shops in various major towns stopped business and took precautions. However, not long after the air raid alarm was lifted, people returned to their places of work and took their positions to engage in their great reconstruction project. The general Chinese people had quite humorous remarks about the Japanese bombing, saying that the Chinese were just wanting to have these old-fashioned houses destroyed, and the Japanese were actually willing to use tools worth tens of thousands of yuan per bomb to replace the hard work of the workers, which was very grateful.

The Glorious History Is About to Be Completed

The value of foreign goods in the local area is extremely high. For example, I went to a bar to buy a small glass of whiskey, and it cost as much as sixteen yuan. The person is a typical Frenchman, so his conversation was elegant and humorous. When the conversation reached this point, he opened his mouth wide and stared silently for a long time, then excitedly gesticulated and described the infinite hope of Free China, saying that it made people believe that the dawn of China's victory in the war of resistance was not far away. He concluded by saying, "It goes without saying that China will be able to obtain its sovereignty and territorial integrity. The heroic spirit of the Chinese people this time, and the international environment and material conditions of both China and Japan, have long proven who victory belongs to, and the completion of China's glorious history is only a matter of time."

### French Army Cement Shelter Discovers a Bomb, Police Deny the Incident, Western Newspapers Say They Witnessed It

According to the English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post, at 3:30 PM today (the 5th), a bomb was found in the cement shelter across from the Greater Shanghai Evening Post office. It is reported that since the morning of the 3rd, French Annamese soldiers have been stationed in the shelter, and barbed wire obstacles have been erected to strengthen the protection of the Greater Shanghai Evening Post office. It is reported that a high-explosive bomb was recently discovered in the printing room of the Greater Shanghai Evening Post, and a Russian police officer suddenly disappeared. Now there is another bomb in the cement shelter, which deepens the suspicions. According to the French Concession Police Department's response to reporters, no bomb was found in the shelter, only an electrician was installing a fan in the shelter, causing a disturbance. However, reporters glimpsed the bomb, which was 6 inches long, 4 inches wide, and 2 inches deep.

Two Russian Police Officers Dismissed for Disappearance

According to the English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post, the Russian police officer Haliabin of the French Concession Police Department, recently disappeared while guarding the Greater Shanghai Evening Post office. According to sources close to the police, Mr. Haliabin was previously involved with a certain White Russian "fascist" group in Harbin. Therefore, the French Police Department has dismissed two other Russian police officers. The French Police Department declined to comment on this statement. It is believed that the two dismissed Russian police officers were close friends of Mr. Haliabin.

### Japanese Aircraft Sighting Over the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, Indiscriminate Bombing for Days Without Losses, Japanese Heavy Artillery Bombarding the Jiangnan Battlefield at the Humen Fortress

The Ningbo Shanghai Association yesterday continued to receive reports on the situation after the recapture of Zhenhai as follows: (1) At 2:15 AM yesterday, four Japanese warships were anchored outside the port of Zhenhai. Two of them sailed away, and one remained, firing two shells towards Jiangnan at around 9:00 AM. Also, at 3:45 AM yesterday, two Japanese warships were discovered on the Hengshan sea, without any changes. (2) At 7:12 AM and 10:50 AM the previous morning, the Japanese warships outside the port of Zhenhai fiercely bombarded battlefields in Jiangnan with heavy artillery, firing more than twenty shells one after another. Intermittent artillery fire could be heard in Ningbo, but the shells all fell in remote suburbs, so there was no loss whatsoever. (3) At 8:30 AM the previous morning, a medium-sized Japanese warship on the Qiancang sea also fired more than ten shells aimlessly towards the Xiangshan port coast, and released speedboats to chase after civilian ships, capturing dozens of them.

Japanese Aircraft Sightings

(4) At 2:35 PM the previous afternoon, Japanese aircraft appeared over Wenling. Ningbo issued an air raid alert. The aircraft crossed Ninghai. Ningbo issued an emergency alert. The aircraft then circled over Songao, Fenghua, and the four suburbs of Ningbo, and then flew out to sea from Longshan. Ningbo only lifted the alert at 3:03 PM. (5) In other news, a large number of Japanese aircraft, totaling 24, passed through the Qianqing town between Xiaoshan and Shaoxing yesterday, flying west in formation. Later, it was heard that Japanese aircraft had also passed through Fengqiao, Yiqiao, and Dongyang. However, their final destination is unknown. Also, in recent days, the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway line has been indiscriminately bombed by Japanese aircraft. It is speculated that these Japanese aircraft will harass the railway line again. (6) At 8:48 AM on the morning, a Japanese aircraft was discovered over Guanhaiwei. Ningbo issued an air raid emergency alert. Afterwards, the whereabouts of the aircraft were unknown. At 9:08 AM, the alert was lifted. At 3:09 PM in the afternoon, the sound of aircraft was heard in Shipu. Ningbo issued an air raid alert again. The alert was lifted at 3:30 PM.

Zhenhai Emergency Relief

Since Zhenhai suffered from the ravages of war, the Ningbo Shanghai Association has received telegrams one after another requesting relief. Out of concern, the executive committee decided at yesterday's standing committee meeting that it was important to provide relief and assistance to the disaster-stricken people of Zhenhai, and decided to allocate 30,000 yuan, which was remitted to Mr. Jiang Zaitian, a respected elder in Zhenhai, to handle the relief matters nearby. The funds were sent by telegraphic transfer and could be received yesterday. He was specifically responsible for handling the relief matters and was instructed to report the progress of the relief efforts at any time to alleviate concerns. The Zhenhai Emergency Relief Association, organized by the Zhenhai Shanghai Association, had already allocated 10,000 yuan in donations from Shanghai at the end of last month. According to the association's message yesterday, it has been remitted to Zhenhai, and Mr. Zhang Baochao, a member of the World Red Swastika Society in Ningbo, has been sent to Zhenhai to join Mr. Jin Guanggan, the person in charge of the Zhenhai Red Swastika Society, to distribute relief to Xiaogang in Jiangnan and the western suburbs of the county seat of Jiangbei.

### British Authority Denies Japanese Newspaper's Report of British Spy Network as Absurd, Claims It Is Completely Unfounded, Also States That British-American Discord Is a Fabrication

According to authoritative British sources in this port, the recent publication by the Japanese-language Continental News of the so-called exposure of a large British spy network operating in Shanghai is completely fabricated and has no basis. The various inferences in an article published by the newspaper on Saturday are obviously clumsy and not credible. It is claimed that all British-backed cultural organizations and businesses are playing an important role in espionage activities, etc., which is completely absurd and everyone can understand. Regarding the mention of cultural organizations, the newspaper seems to be completely reprinting the opinions expressed by a certain Japanese official in Tokyo. The official recently made similar accusations against Anglo-Japanese cultural contacts in Japan. Therefore, the newspaper's allegations obviously distort the facts and can only be believed by those who are completely unaware of the situation. The news published by the Continental News on Friday (August ) further confirms that the newspaper deliberately creates various reasons to accuse Britain. It is claimed that "British and American expatriates in Shanghai are mutually scolding each other in wireless broadcasts. A statement on the XCDN radio station stated that 'President Roosevelt had previously suggested Anglo-American cooperation, and said that the front line of democratic countries is actually on the banks of the Rhine, and at the same time guaranteed that he would participate in joint cooperation in international affairs. Has this cooperation been implemented? The United States dares not consider the current situation from the British point of view. Britain trusts the United States too much, resulting in Britain making concessions in the Far East, and the date when the United States will be defeated by Japan is not far away.'" The newspaper continued to say that the Americans refuted the British statement, saying, "Although the British have solemnly expressed mutual support to the United States, they are too impatient and act too independently, resulting in today's tragic situation..." The newspaper's editorial also said, "This kind of mutual scolding on wireless broadcasts has become a laughing stock among the Chinese." According to the British authoritative sources, the XCDN station has never made the above-mentioned statement, nor has it broadcast any report that would cause the above misunderstanding. The contents of the Japanese-language newspaper are completely fabricated from beginning to end. Therefore, the news about the British spy network published by the newspaper is also fabricated.

### Although Yizhong Tobacco Factory Resumes Work, Disputes Abound: The Factory Deducts Wages, and the Workers Have Not Compromised

The Yizhong Tobacco Company's branch factory in the 路 district, after being shut down, has reportedly resumed work on the first of this month. At the beginning of the resumption, the factory sent a large number of detectives. Without stating any reason, they searched the workers. Forced by the need to make a living, the workers had no choice but to swallow their anger and let them do as they pleased. Regarding the nine workers who had been previously announced as dismissed, despite repeated requests from all the workers to retract the decision, the factory has not made a clear statement. Furthermore, the rice subsidy and allowance during the shutdown period were deducted, disregarding the workers' livelihood. The factory's subsidy and rice allowance for the shutdown period were issued starting from the 16th of last month. However, in reality, the factory had closed its doors and sent detectives to prevent workers from going to work since the 11th. Therefore, the shutdown period should fairly start from the 11th. This action by the factory deducts five yuan, seven jiao, and three fen of rice allowance, and two yuan, three jiao, and six fen of allowance from each worker. Considering that there are more than 2,600 workers in total, the amount is quite considerable. However, the losses suffered by the workers are enormous. Therefore, although the factory workers have resumed work, they are still arguing with the factory about the dismissal of the nine coworkers and the deducted allowances and rice subsidies. They also hope for sympathy and assistance from all sectors of society to prevent the situation from worsening.

### Zhenhai Port: Cengang Opens to Navigation

Plans for ships to dock at Gu'aotou. According to news from the shipping industry yesterday, the Ningbo River Defense Commander has ordered the prohibition of all sailing ships and steamers from entering, in order to strictly prevent illegal elements from infiltrating. Therefore, transportation between Shanghai and Ningbo has been completely cut off. However, it is learned that 利瑪 Wheel, intentionally managed by the Ping'an Shipping Company, will operate between Shanghai and Cengang (unoccupied territory) in Zhoushan. It left Shanghai the day before yesterday to carry passengers and cargo. Cengang is located outside Zhenhai Port, only 80 nautical miles away, and there are civilian ships traveling back and forth.

Test Voyage to Gu'ao

Wenzhou routes have the most foreign ships operating on them. Since the suspension of navigation, all ships have been anchored in the Pei River, resulting in significant losses. To maintain business, shipping merchants now plan to temporarily operate on the Aojiang route, so as to transfer passengers and goods to Wenzhou. Foreign ships heading to that area will dock at Gu'aotou. This matter is currently being submitted to the consulate authorities for approval. The Changde Wheel of the Italian company Rocco Chi & Co. is scheduled to clear customs this morning. To obtain approval from the customs, it will first conduct a test voyage from Shanghai to Gu'aotou tomorrow morning. Special dispatch from Chongming.

### Japanese Army Massacre: Chongming Suffers Calamity; Over a Hundred Japanese Soldiers Killed; Thousands of Civilians Perish; Over a Hundred Puppet Soldiers Among the Japanese Army Annihilated

After the fall of Chongming, guerrilla organizations were formed, launching attacks from the east and west, achieving remarkable results. Last month, they launched a large-scale attack. Three Japanese army vehicles were ambushed and surrounded by guerrillas. The Japanese army suffered heavy casualties. Out of shame and anger, they requested reinforcements. They went down to the villages and indiscriminately burned and killed, resulting in the tragic death of thousands of innocent civilians. Furthermore, it is learned that villages and towns such as Shuhe, Dachun, Laba, Xiangtong, Maqiao, Xie, and Rixin, as well as thousands of nearby households, were completely reduced to scorched earth. The burning and killing continued in the past few days. The residents of the county were in a state of panic and could not sleep or eat. Refugees were displaced and had nowhere to turn, their situation extremely miserable. The Chongming fellow villagers in this city are planning to organize a relief association to allocate funds for relief and handle the aftermath.

Over a Hundred Japanese Soldiers Ambushed and Killed

Chongming is surrounded by the sea on all sides and fell into the hands of the Japanese army after the war. However, as the Japanese army suffered successive defeats on various battlefields, the garrisoned Japanese army was completely withdrawn. In total, only sixty to seventy soldiers remained on the entire island. The Chinese military guerrilla forces in Beisha, after receiving orders to launch an offensive, immediately ordered more than ten members to cross the river to Rixin Town in Chongming at the end of last month. They worked as temporary laborers in Japanese factories to take the opportunity to launch an uprising from within. On the midnight of the second of this month, the workers, seizing the opportunity when it was late and quiet, killed all three Japanese people in the factory. After the incident, the guerrillas dispersed and ambushed in the countryside. The local Japanese garrison received the report and immediately summoned all the Japanese soldiers to attack the Chinese army. However, at this time, a large force of the Beisha Chinese army had also crossed the river and attacked the Japanese from both sides. After two hours of fierce fighting, the Japanese army suffered more than ten casualties and retreated. The Japanese army then requested assistance from the Japanese garrison in Shanghai. The Chinese army, knowing that the Japanese army would not give up after the defeat, dug many traps in the main roads, covered them with straw to avoid detection by the Japanese army. When more than eighty Japanese reinforcements from Shanghai arrived in Chongming, they changed to three trucks and advanced towards Rixin Town. As a result, they fell into the Chinese army's trap. The soldiers and vehicles all fell into the pits. The Chinese army, ambushing around, swept the area with machine guns. The Japanese were trapped and unable to resist, and all perished in the pits.

Puppet Self-Defense Corps Annihilated by the Japanese

After the Chinese army achieved two major victories, they dispersed to various villages and towns in the three districts and the 叫 district, such as Dachun Town, Qiangming Township, Puzhen Port, and Xinkai River. The Chongming Japanese army, after suffering two defeats, requested assistance from Shanghai. The Japanese authorities in Shanghai immediately dispatched four hundred soldiers from the defeated troops at Zhenhai Port, transported them by motorboats and transport ships. When they arrived at their destination, the Chinese army had already completed its mission and withdrawn. The Japanese army then disarmed the puppet "Self-Defense Corps" in each area under the pretext of inspection, and then said that the weather was hot and they could play other games, so they could take off their uniforms and bullets. The puppet soldiers, unaware of the plot, complied completely. The Japanese army then indiscriminately swept more than one hundred puppet soldiers with machine guns, leaving no survivors.

Massacre and Burning of Houses: Inhuman Tragedy

After the Japanese army annihilated the puppet Self-Defense Corps, they carried out a massacre of strong men and women in Qiangming Township, Rixin Town, Dachun Town, Xinkai River, Puzhen Port, and other places. Except for the elderly and weak aged seventy or eighty and five or six years old, none were spared. In total, more than seven hundred civilians were killed. All streets, villages, and houses were doused with kerosene and set on fire, burning more than a thousand households. The flames soared into the sky, and the sound of crying shook the earth. The tragic situation was unprecedented in recent times, surpassing the massacres and burnings in Wuzhen and Yuanhua in Zhejiang Province. After this massacre in Chongming, the residents who had not suffered any calamity were extremely frightened. For the sake of safety, they left their homes and moved elsewhere. However, the Japanese army remained unwilling to give up and obstructed the residents from leaving, requiring them to find temporary guarantors and stipulating that only young children and the elderly were allowed to leave. Others were killed without question. Although local Japanese merchants requested leniency to maintain their own business, they were rejected. Residents from other districts, upon hearing the news, supported the old and carried the young, and transferred to Shanghai by boat. The number of people arriving at the port every day was over a thousand. The Chongming people in Shanghai went to the port every day to inquire about the situation in their hometowns, and the number of people crying and wailing in misery was beyond count. The cruel situation is evident. This kind of city massacre tragedy is rare in human history.

### Japanese Confiscate Large Numbers of Mail Items at Masnan Road Post Office: Inspection Room Completed, Nine Japanese Start Work Yesterday Morning

The issue of mail inspection at the Masnan Road Post Office in the French Concession: Because the inspectors did not go to the bureau for work on the 2nd and 3rd, and the 4th was a regular Sunday holiday, the inspection was not fully completed. Rumors spread widely. Yesterday morning, the Japanese inspectors returned to the bureau, and the number of people increased. The inspection and confiscation of mail items also began to take action. The details are as follows:

Inspection Room Completed

According to a reporter from Datong News Agency, the temporary inspection room for Japanese inspectors at the Masnan Road Post Office branch was rushed to completion on the 3rd of this month (Saturday). The location is next to the parcel counter of the bureau, covering an area of ​​12 feet long and 10 feet wide. Wooden boards are placed around it, completely isolating it from the area where postal staff handle postal services.

Japanese Inspectors Stationed Yesterday

Japanese inspectors arrived at the bureau again yesterday at 10:00, increasing the number of people from seven to nine. They immediately began to work in the newly built inspection room. However, when the inspectors arrived at the bureau, the first batch of letters at 8:30 in the morning had already been sent out, so they were not inspected. The second batch of mail, before being sent out at 10:30, was inspected when stamped.

Large Numbers of Mail Items Confiscated

The Japanese inspectors then selected more than one hundred letters, printed matter, and temple mail, and handed them over to postal staff to be numbered and registered in the register. They then took all of them into the inspection room for inspection. The inspectors left the bureau at about 12:00 noon. The inspectors then arrived at the bureau again in the afternoon, and the 2:30 and 4:30 afternoon mail were also selected and taken into the room. As of the evening, the mail that was deemed irrelevant after inspection had not been returned. The inspection of mail such as registered mail and express mail also began to be affected in the afternoon. The Japanese inspectors left the bureau and returned at about 5:00.

Different Records

Yesterday afternoon, a reporter from Datong News Agency visited Wang Weisheng, the director of the postal administration. According to Wang, today was the most concrete beginning of the inspection of mail at the Masnan Road Post Office. On the morning of the 1st of this month, the bureau initially received a report from the patrolmen that the inspection had begun. Therefore, he frankly admitted it to visitors at the time. Later, according to follow-up reports, it had not actually started yet. The actions of the Japanese inspectors were the same as before the 1st. Therefore, the bureau informed visitors at this time that it had not started yet. Due to the difference in time between the concerns and inquiries, there were two different records in the newspaper.

### White Russian General Kapov Arrested by the Police: Related to the Murder of Messla; Kapov Was the Former Anti-Communist Leader in Harbin

The English-language *North China Daily Mail* reports that Messla, chairman of the White Russian community in this city, was stabbed to death on Nanyang Road on the morning of the 1st of this month. Regarding this case, the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department has arrested General Kapov, the former leader of the White Russian anti-Communist group in Harbin. Kapov was arrested yesterday (the 4th) while walking along Sichuan Road on the south bank of the Suzhou River. He is currently being held in the police station along with the Chinese suspects arrested on Saturday morning for interrogation.

The Inside Story of the Case Is of Great Interest

The *Shanghai Times* reports that the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department has interrogated three suspects in connection with the murder of Messla. To facilitate the police's thorough investigation of this case, the Police Department cannot disclose the progress of the investigation, for fear of hindering the investigation. However, it is heard that the police are investigating this case in great detail. Interesting news may be revealed in the future. Several Chinese and Western witnesses have provided detectives with valuable information, and it is expected that the murderer will be identified and arrested soon.

Love Remains: People Pray

Messla's body remained at the International Funeral Home yesterday (the 4th). His friends went to pay their respects. Messla's body was dressed in the uniform of a diplomat of the Russian Empire, as Messla had served as a consul in Shanghai and other places during the Imperial Russian era. The White Russians in this city deeply mourned Messla's tragic death. Yesterday, they went to various White Russian churches to pray for the deceased. It is heard that Messla's wife is recuperating in Japan and is unaware that her husband has passed away, having only received news that her husband was critically ill. She has now left Japan by ship and is expected to arrive in Shanghai this afternoon (the 5th). Messla's body will probably be buried on Wednesday at the Jing'an Temple Road Public Cemetery or the Hongqiao Road Public Cemetery.

Japanese Authorities Detain Two Koreans

Regarding the car used by the murderer who assassinated Messla, it came from a car dealership in Zhabei. It is now learned that the two Korean owners of the car dealership have been investigated by the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department. As of yesterday, the Japanese authorities have detained the two Koreans. It was not announced yesterday whether they will be charged with aiding and abetting murder. Their names are also unknown.

### Case of Tram Inspector Killed: Witnesses Testify on the Events; The Murderer Denies Receiving Bribes in Advance; Court Hearing Adjourned Pending Review of the Records

Chen Guohua, the No. 5 inspector of the French tram company, was killed by thugs on the No. 849 Gan Yi Road bus at 2:10 PM on the 25th of last month. The patrolman Hua Ebu captured the murderer, Lu Rusheng, who was wounded. Based on Lu's confession, Wu Senxiang, Bian Jintang, Lu Dianchun, and suspects Xu Renchang, Zheng Yuntian, Lu Zhifa, Yuan Jinshan, and others, totaling thirty people, were arrested and sent to the Special No. 2 Court's Criminal Division 1. Except for Xu Renchang, who was found to be unrelated and not prosecuted, all the other defendants were prosecuted for murder under Article 271 of the Criminal Law. After Judge Zhang Minsheng interrogated them once, he ordered a postponement of the hearing. All the details have been reported in previous newspapers. Yesterday morning was the date for the continuation of the hearing. The audience seats were full. The police dispatched twenty detectives and thirty Chinese police officers to the court for protection. First, witness Li Fenglou, the driver of the No. 849 bus, testified that he heard two gunshots that day. When he looked back, the No. 5 inspector had fallen to the ground. At that time, he continued to drive the bus. The murderer also fired a shot at him, but it missed and grazed his back. He then stopped the bus, and the murderer got out of the car and fled. Next, Wu Renfu, the ticket seller on the car with number 216, testified that he was selling tickets to passengers that day, so he did not know the rest of the situation. Then, the Chinese police officer with number 1100 testified that he was directing traffic at the intersection of Route Lafayette and Father King Road and saw someone running towards him. He was about to stop him when the murderer took out a gun and fired at him. He dodged and missed, and the stray bullet killed Ji Jinfu, a two-year-old boy living at No. 98 Father King Road. Finally, Chinese police officers with numbers 730, 739, and 302 testified that they were patrolling on Father King Road that day when they suddenly heard gunshots on the bus and heard passengers on the car shouting that the murderer was escaping. Soon after, they saw the murderer running towards them and joined forces with the Russian police officer with number 155 to shoot the murderer, causing the murderer to be injured and fall next to the No. 55 electric pole on Moli'ai Road. At this point, the police lawyer Yao Zhaodi requested the court to question the murderer Lu Rusheng about whether he had received 250 yuan from the defendants before shooting the deceased. According to Lu, he had not received 250 yuan and had not heard of such money. However, he knew Bian Jintang in the South City. This time, Bian lost his job and asked him for help, so he committed the murder. The court adjourned the hearing and ordered the investigating officer Yan Jinwen to take the defendants back to the police station pending a detailed review of the records.

### Confessed to Killing His Wife and Surrendered: Whether It Is True Remains to Be Investigated

A man from Changzhou named Ding Xuda (28 years old) suddenly surrendered to the Laoza Gate Police Station on Saturday night, saying that his wife, Gao (24 years old), had been killed by him, so he surrendered. The Chinese investigator Li Pengfei investigated the matter. According to Ding, he had been married to his wife Gao for eight years and had a son (seven years old) and a daughter (three years old). They used to live in their hometown. Recently, due to the unrest in the area, they left the two children with the Qi family and came to Shanghai with his wife. They arrived in Shanghai on the 14th of last month and stayed in a small inn near the Great World. They lived there for four days. Later, because they did not have much money, they were eating their way through it, and the money was running out. They discussed ways to make a living. His wife was willing to go out to work as a helper, and he also planned to pursue his usual tailoring business. They decided to go out to make a living on the 18th. If they were successful, they would meet at the inn at 1:00 PM. He found a tailoring job, so he arrived at the sewing shop at the appointed time. But he waited a long time and did not see his wife arrive. He had no choice but to check out of the inn. He searched for several days but could not find his wife. On the night of the 2nd of the month, he suddenly met his wife at the intersection of Xinzha Road and Changsha Road. According to his wife, she had found a job. He questioned her as to why she did not go to the agreed-upon meeting place, and they started arguing. They walked together to the Suzhou River on Yu Qiaqing Road. In a moment of anger, he beat his wife several times. Unexpectedly, she fell to the ground and died. There was nothing he could do, so he threw the body into the Suzhou River. He asked himself if he had encountered this misfortune, so he surrendered. However, the investigators could not find his wife's body, so they temporarily detained Ding. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Special No. 1 Court's Criminal Division 1. Police lawyer Ru Baoyi said that whether Ding's confession was true still needed to be investigated in detail, so he requested permission to temporarily detain him and re-examine him at a later date. After questioning by Judge Xiao 棻, the court ordered Ding Xuda to be temporarily detained for a week for re-examination.

### Coir Mattress Industry Labor Dispute: Argument in Teahouse Turns Violent; Thirteen Workers Fined

There are more than 100 businesses that operate coir mattress shops in Shanghai, and there are quite a few workers. After the establishment of the labor union last year, the employers, in view of social trends, established a guild in the early summer of this year. Recently, they held an inaugural meeting and elected Sheng Yongfa as the chairman of the committee and submitted it to the competent authority for filing. The guild stipulated that a fee of one jiao would be charged for each coir mattress sold in the same industry. If it is found that the fees stipulated in the articles of association have been evaded and not paid, a fine of five yuan in national currency will be imposed for each coir mattress to show punishment. This aroused opposition from the labor union, believing that they could not afford to pay this burden during the current high cost of living in Shanghai. Therefore, the labor and management decided to discuss the guild regulations at the Nanyang Teahouse a few days ago. Once they disagreed, the two sides began to quarrel and then turned violent. Teapots and teacups were used as weapons and thrown at each other, flying all over the room. The chairman of the employer's guild, Sheng Yongfa, and others, and the workers of the labor union were all injured, with their heads broken and bleeding. The owner of the teahouse, Wang Bingfu, could not stop them and reported it to the police station in charge, who immediately dispatched a large number of detectives to the scene and detained 23 people from both labor and management. After interrogation, they were sent to the court yesterday. The police lawyer sued them for crimes such as injury and damage. After Judge Zhong's review, he declared the verdict in court. Sheng Yongfa, Xu Rongsheng, and other nine people from the employer's side were found not guilty. Thirteen workers from the labor union were each fined ten yuan as a warning.

### Rampant Gambling in the Nanshi Area; Gambling Dens in West Shanghai Merge into One Business

Gambling dens in the Nanshi area have become very active recently. Among the larger ones, the most prominent is Li Xiaoshi's Lao Ximen Xiyuan gambling den, which opened on the 31st of this month. It even had so-called male and female celebrities inaugurating it with a ribbon-cutting ceremony. After its opening, there was also a Western music gambling den opposite the Chen Yingshi Pagoda in Lao Ximen, near Jinjia Arch. There was the Yongyuan gambling den on Dajing Road, the Yongli gambling den on Luxiangyuan Road in the Nine Acres area, and the Tongbaotai on Gaodun Road, which specialized in defrauding people of their money.

These gambling dens appeared one after another.

They are all managed by a group of people led by Lu Gensheng and Xiang Changlin. Li Xiaobao's flower lottery has also been greatly expanded. A group of listeners have even installed beautiful counters and neon signs in places like the Nine Acres area, just like lottery ticket shops. In addition, there are opium dens like the Siwu Liu Talking Room, the Gaolu, the Wannianqing, and the Nanyang Bridge Paradise in the Nine Acres area. All of these places have

rosewood opium beds,

often as many as ten or more in each establishment, with colorful electric light signs, exactly the same as the large opium dens on Jing'an Temple Road in West Shanghai. However, the Sanxin gambling den, which cost 170,000 yuan, was uniquely prohibited from opening after a postponement of seven months, causing its manager, Pu Aben, great distress. As for the gambling dens in the badlands of West Shanghai, after being sealed by the Japanese military police, the owners of the various gambling dens worked hard to maneuver and changed their names to dance halls, night gardens, and grand hotels, so that they could be revived and continue to operate in a semi-public manner, purely as a temporary measure. However, six establishments including Hollywood, on the 31st of last month,

merged into one,

moving to a new location to do business, temporarily named "Six Nations Hotel" (or possibly renamed "Hualian"). The new location is at 346 Haig Road, on the border between the Public Concession and the French Concession. Due to the small size of the premises, it is said that the gamblers who went there were initially quite crowded, and the Public Concession police authorities, in order to prevent accidents, dispatched red police vehicles to patrol in front of the gambling den every day, and inspected passers-by, so business has declined greatly recently.

### Shenxin No. 1 Factory Sued for Repaying Deposits; Court Orders Mediation

Zhang Jingji, a depositor at Shenxin Textile Factory No. 1 on Bailinan Road, previously entrusted lawyer Cai Liucheng to file a lawsuit with the First Special District Court to recover his deposit. The court ruled that the defendant, Shenxin Textile Company, should pay the plaintiff 57,922 yuan in national currency, plus interest. If the company's assets were insufficient to pay, the defendants, Rong Hongyuan and Rong Hongsan, would be jointly and severally liable. The defendants argued that the company's operations were currently suspended due to the war, the company's foreign debts were unpaid, and Zhang Jingji's deposit was deposited by Zhang Zhizhao, a shareholder of the company. Unless the company continues to operate and repays ordinary debts, the shareholder has no right to claim the deposit. Therefore, they disagreed with the original judgment and entrusted a lawyer to file an appeal. The court opened yesterday morning and ordered both parties to go out for mediation, with the court scheduled to reconvene on August 16.

### Fujian Provincial Government Orders All Counties to Increase Salaries for Primary School Teachers by Five Yuan Each, Starting from This Month

The Fujian Provincial Government recently issued an order to all county governments, stating that the provincial government had previously stipulated that, due to the difficult living conditions and low salaries of teachers and staff in central schools and national schools, starting from February, the monthly salary of qualified primary school homeroom teachers registered or certified in the province should be at least 24 yuan. The monthly salary of qualified specialist teachers in junior primary schools and kindergartens should be at least 20 yuan. The monthly salary of substitute teachers who have not been registered, certified, or qualified should not be less than 18 yuan. If the counties and districts have exceeded the previous regulations, they should still appropriately increase the salaries. It has been ordered to strictly comply with the regulations. Recently, due to the rising prices of goods, the previously set standards still cannot enable all teachers and staff to serve with peace of mind. Starting from May, all salaries will be increased by another five yuan to show compassion. However, the amount added in March should be deducted (for example, if the original salary was 26 yuan and the salary was increased by 3 yuan in March of this year, then only 2 yuan needs to be added to the salary starting from May). If the amount of the salary increase has already exceeded five yuan, the original amount should be maintained and not increased or decreased.

The rising trend in the rice market: not since the morning opening of the day before yesterday's Sunday holiday, the situation has been tight. Sellers insisted, buyers pursued, and mainland buyers were also unwilling to show weakness. General floating hoarders and retail investors, seeing the market color旺, were unwilling to miss a good opportunity, and followed the deer. For a time, shouting prices flew wildly. Until the middle of the market, in an instant, No. 1 Chen Saigon reached the 60 yuan mark, No. 2 was 54 yuan, Fire Grain was 58 yuan and a half, and Small Grain was 54 yuan. When this was slightly stable and presented a wandering pattern, floating traders took the opportunity to sell their profitable goods at high prices. As a result, there was a lot of goods on the market, and the situation turned soft. The market gradually returned to a low level. As a result, it rose by a yuan compared to the previous week's closing. No. 1 East-West Saigon was calculated at 59 yuan, and New was 57 yuan. The reason why rice prices were raised was precisely because of the deteriorating relations between Britain and Japan and the issue of Japan's southward advance, which led the goods side to take the opportunity to raise prices. The new floating hoards all took the opportunity to活 跃, and the skin ball trading of抢帽子 gradually began to raise its head on the market again.

The price opened at 62 yuan for commercial goods, and 61 yuan for second-grade goods. According to the owner, the wind and rain were still evenly distributed in the early stage of this year, and it was not affected.

Check the disk of the No. 2 flour factory is still 15 yuan, and it will not increase or decrease for the time being. The total amount of the two factories sold in the city is about 5,000 bags. There is no big difference in the market. However, the rising wind of Japanese factory flour has eased. This month's Phoenix brand is still opened at 14 yuan and 4 jiao, and it will be松 to 14 yuan and 3 jiao and a half. September also松 from 14 yuan and 6 jiao and a half to 14 yuan and 6 jiao, which is slightly smaller than before.

Wheat: Yesterday's wheat market situation is still in the brewing stage. Check the source of Su Xi, because the production price is tight, the arrival is reduced, so the holders all want to sell at a good price. However, because the Japanese factory's inventory is still sufficient, the进 胃 is not strong. Only a few scattered unloading factory goods, and the Chinese factory received more than 2,000 bags, pulling the price at 21 yuan and 45 jiao.

### Securities
Domestic Debt Rises, Foreign Stocks Are Flat and Tired

Securities dark market: Yesterday's market situation continued to be firm, and people's hearts became more and more prosperous. Because the United States is tough on Japan and the friction between Britain and Japan is getting worse, the market price after deducting interest is already higher than the 除息 time with the interest included. Generally, people believe that it is possible to have the same price as the interest included soon. According to the market popularity and the high barriers of the shorts, it is not impossible. Yesterday, type A had already passed out one yuan, type B had already passed out two yuan, and type E had approached the 50 yuan mark, and the situation was very good. At the same time, although gold is rising, the debt market is not threatened by it, because there are too many shorts. Yesterday, the market price in the morning and afternoon gradually and slowly rose. The attention of buyers and sellers should be paid to No. 38, which specializes in buying type A, because of its close relationship with the lottery. Gong Mao specializes in collecting type B, because it is relatively cheap. Type C is raised by Xie Da, because the market is almost equal to type D. Type D is most favored by No. 16, and the purchase is always unremitting throughout the day. No. 4 collects type E, which is its consistent purpose. The remaining sporadic buyers are not counted. On the selling side, type A is supplied by Yu Xing and Wu Yuan, type B is sold by Hong Kang and sporadic retail investors in many ways, type C is sold by Tong Yu and retail investors, and types D and E are sold by Ji Ji and Da Kangcheng. The daily market price competition is still dominated by many parties. As a result, each bond returned to the upper one or two jiao to five and a half jiao. The total transaction volume was about 1.2 million yuan. A brief table is listed below.

Category Highest Lowest Closing Compared to Previous Day

Unified A 61.10 60.60 61.10 Rise 0.45

Unified B 52.05 51.60 52.05 Rise 0.55

Unified C 49.60 49.30 49.60 Also 0.50

Unified D 49.40 49.25 49.40 Also 0.10

Unified E 49.80 49.50 49.80 Also 0.20

Stock trading: 200 shares of Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company were traded at a price of 11 yuan and 5 jiao, and 246 shares of Zhabei Water and Electricity were traded at a price of 5 yuan and 9 jiao and a half.

Yesterday's public stock market: 隍 is uncertain, the fluctuation scale is expanded, and the transaction is still considerable. The opening trend is not firm, because the foreign exchange market is reported to be tight again and again, and the prices of each stock are roughly returned. However, in the afternoon, the selling wind suddenly turned strong again, and the market situation fell again. The closing price is the lowest of the day. The instability of the political situation is probably the main reason for the softening of the stock market. Unless this situation can have a turnaround, it is difficult to expect much improvement for a while.

### Yarn and Cotton
Hong Kong Gang Sells Exclusively, Cotton Yarn Wants to Rise But Is Blocked

The yarn market is trending firm, and the rising wind is rising again. This is because the long-久远 muted foreign exchange has suddenly tightened, which has triggered the activities of speculators.

However, speculators are unanimously涨 矣.

At the same time, the Hong Kong gang reversed and saw the selling reverse wind of Double Horse. At the time of the closing on the table, it was heard that the foreign exchange was even reduced, and people's hearts were振 奋.

Yunnan 200 Counterparts 1,640

Hong Kong 100 Fuzhou 30

Xiamen 5 Statistics 1,975

### Cotton Sales Gradually Activated

Current cotton transactions are gradually becoming active. This is because exchange rates are trending down, and at the same time, cotton yarn prices are上 扬, so all parties have a slight need. However, the factory still has tight funds, and the payment still needs to be delayed for a month. The current cotton situation is recorded on the left.

Fire Machine Wood Frame 153.75 Sen Taijin 180 bags

Fire Machine 151.00 yuan Chengjin 548 bags

Later, due to the increased demand from spot merchants and the short covering of some shorts, the closing price rose by three or five pounds. India's forecast yesterday, including the forecast, fell by more than one rupee.

Shanghai's foreign cotton transactions: there has been no improvement in recent days. Although the exchange rate has turned tight, the cotton price has also been拖带不前 because of the sluggish yarn sales. Generally, it is observed that the cotton price will not fall again.

Japanese Merchants Dominate the Silk Market

The forward price was 1383 yuan, and the recent price was 1375 yuan, which was slightly smaller than the previous Saturday by 4 yuan to 8 yuan.

Yesterday, it was calculated that 180 dans of Ediri Jing Zheng brand were made, and the price ranged from 2590 yuan to 2600 yuan. On the contrary, British and French foreign firms were deserted, and there were no goods to buy.

### Coal
White Coal Dark Market Is Very Tight

Although the actual sales of white coal are not旺 Recently, there are few customers, but the local stores are absorbing it cheaply, and the search is very keen. Therefore, the clear market is stable, and the dark market is very tight. According to the opening of the local door Zhuang Hongji white coal, each ton is 210 yuan, and the decorative block is 220 yuan, delivered to the customer, including the handling fee.

### Hardware
Mouth Iron Is As Firm As Ever

Since entering the summer, the customer gangs have been cut off from the Tinplate market. The local business is also clear, and the door Zhuang business is also bleak. The number of transactions since February has not reached a thousand, which is really the unprecedented desolation of this commodity. However, the market has jumped and has not fallen since the sharp change in foreign exchange on May 2. The reason is that the overseas arrival has been cut off, and the Shanghai market has limited storage. Therefore, the industry is limited to being optimistic, and people's hearts are firm. Although the inland ports are closed and sales are sluggish, and the local business is also desolate, the market has not seen a sharp drop from beginning to end. The most recent selling price is 240 yuan per box for 180-pound American goods and more than 260 yuan per box for 200-pound American goods. The 180-pound English and Italian goods and 200-pound English and Italian goods, because there are not many goods in circulation on the market, there are very few buyers and sellers, and the market is slightly inferior to American goods.

### Newspaper Excerpts Sixty-Seven Years Ago (See This Newspaper from the 12th Year of the Tongzhi Reign of the Late Qing Dynasty) (467) The Harm of Lewd Plays

The harm of lewd plays is greater than that of lewd books. Lewd books can only be understood by those who are literate, while lewd plays harm both the wise and the foolish. If students, after reciting and chanting in the evening, watch a lewd play, their diligence will be abandoned, and lustful thoughts will arise. If wealthy young men, accustomed to luxury, watch a lewd play, their family fortune will dwindle, and their vital essence will be lost. If farmers, working hard in the fields in all kinds of weather, watch a lewd play, their fields will be neglected, and their energy will be depleted. If merchants, calculating and planning meticulously, watch a lewd play, their money will be squandered, and their business will decline. If virtuous unmarried women, pure as white jade, watch a lewd play, their hearts will be stirred, and they will form illicit relationships like Ying Ge before the boudoir. If widows, guarding their chastity and leaving a fragrant name, watch a lewd play, the allure of springtime will trouble them, and they will grieve for the departing swallows behind the beaded curtains. Even lowly maidservants, long separated from music and companionship, will use the excuse of burning incense and lighting candles to create opportunities for mischief once they watch a lewd play. Even poor serving girls, orphaned at an early age, will expose their shame by engaging in immoral behavior like the women of Qi in Sang Zhong once they watch a lewd play. Even nuns, who should be cultivating purity and chanting scriptures, will let their thoughts stray from worldly affairs once they watch a lewd play, and their chanting will sound more like the calls of flower sellers. Even monks, who are supposed to be impartial and just, will violate the rules and regulations once they watch a lewd play, turning their scripture halls into towers of longing for spring. Even celebrating birthdays and honoring deities become occasions for lewd plays, so when will this harm ever end? I imagine that benevolent gentlemen who sponsor moral plays are accumulating merit, but what about those who love to sponsor lewd plays? Do they think it's entertaining? Or do they think it is harmful?

Short Talks

### The Necessity of Lying

— Editor

In a discussion about children's lying, we discovered two facts that had previously escaped our attention:

We found that there is a correlation between family circumstances and children's lying. Children from poor families lie more often than children from affluent families. Our research revealed that this is not because poor children are less moral, but because this unequal society increases their need to lie.

Another startling fact is that girls lie more often than boys on average. This is certainly not because girls have less moral strength than boys. We suspect that this may again be because women's social status is lower than men's in this male-centered society, thus increasing their need to lie.

We believe that children's lying cannot be considered a sin, and is fundamentally not a moral issue, but rather a psychological and child education issue.

When you discover that your young children are lying, there is no need to be at a loss or make a fuss. Just calmly investigate the reasons for their lying, casually study their psychology behind lying, and then decide on a course of action.

The responsibility for children's lying often does not lie with the ignorant children themselves; children's lying is often attributable to parents and guardians.

We must minimize the need for children to lie.

Cultivation

### The Power of Self-Control

— Cao You

In daily life, we often find that friends become enemies, couples separate, and families become unhappy, often due to one or two uncontrolled words. Although these words may seem insignificant, they can sometimes be a serious blow! If we want to avoid creating unnecessary tragedies, we must all exercise self-control over our behavior and speech.

When you read biographies of great people, you will naturally discover that many great figures in history suffered great setbacks and hardships in their youth due to a lack of self-control. However, they later repented and reformed, so that every word and action came from the heart, and they exercised self-control over all their behavior, eventually reaching a state of noble character, receiving the support of the masses, and becoming great figures in history. Abraham Lincoln in America is a prominent example. From this, we can also know that the power of self-control is not innate, but is the result of training. The great German poet Goethe said: "I want to be the master of myself." Indeed, you can make yourself a patient and content person, but at the same time, you can also make yourself a complaining and restless person. We can all develop our own personality and make it a happy one. But you can also make your own mind unhealthy. No one in the world has a temperament that does not need to be restrained, and no temperament is bad, as long as it is cultivated, it will become a good temperament.

A person with high moral values who can often exercise self-control is mostly based on family training in his youth. Other important factors include physical and mental health, good companions, and high education. Therefore, those who are parents should use reasonable methods to teach their children, so that they develop patience, peace, and contentment, and should also maintain their physical and mental health in harmony, and should make them understand that a pure life, a kind heart, and pleasant happiness are far better than a doctor's medicine!

The power of self-control has great benefits for those who are in business or in a political career. Those who run a business cannot expect to succeed without the power of self-control! A successful businessman is often a patient person with a good temper. How can there be patience without self-control? Those who embark on a political career cannot expect others to obey them if they do not have self-control themselves. Only those who can control themselves are qualified to manage and command others!

The power of self-control can be said to be essential for everyone. In a city full of sights and sounds, young people can easily go astray, lose their personality, and harm their lives if they do not have self-control! Only those who have self-control can embark on the road to success in the world.

Essay

### A Dull Life

— Lan Dian

It must be because of the tension in Hong Kong this time! I remember many estranged friends again, you, are also one of those distant friendships!

How is life? - After being apart for so long, it is inevitable to ask this question.

For me, life is really like a turbid river, flowing slowly, and life is in it, like a pile of rotten mud. I really don't want to tell my friends, especially old acquaintances who haven't had any news for a long time, about my life, but I can tell you this: compared to the past, I am much healthier, and will you feel relieved by this?

But even I have come to believe that in this whole long year, life has been dull!

I have some worries, some longings, and some yearnings for the distant South, wouldn't you believe that I have these worries, longings, and yearnings? Really, even I am doubting myself, every day, I worry about losing a heart that has shaken my faith, I also long to pursue a more beautiful and good faith, and also, I can't help but feel some yearnings for the long-lost scenery of the South and my old friends, especially her, our Sophia, she must be very happy now!

Would you hate it if I brought up your old words again? A year ago, you said in a letter: "This is an era of suffering, we are young people, and life is a difficult and complex lesson." Today, are we still in this era of suffering? I feel some uncomfortable ease, and people are all enjoying themselves happily. This doesn't seem like an era of suffering (does it?). We should still be young! However, life, for me, is not a difficult and complex lesson, but rather like a peaceful dream, day after day, flowing past from the bottom of the turbid river, life, without liveliness, without laughter, only the ancient monotony and the dullness!

Would you care about me because of this?

It's just that you haven't been to this "isolated island" paradise, where countless young hearts have turned ice-cold.

Just believe it! Many young people are like this; in their warm lives that have been lost, they also have some worries, some longings, and some yearnings for the distant motherland.

The days will continue to flow like this, and life will be the same, but will the days temper us to be strong? Do you believe that a flash of lightning will flash in the dark storm and rain? It is certain.

Then, our life is not forever trapped in the dullness.

The Detective Hawthorne Case

### The Dancer's Fate

— By Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter Four: Several Speculations

"After midnight yesterday, probably around one o'clock, so you can say it's today. Sir, what kind of person is he? We also found him very strange. Did he do anything?"

Hawthorne didn't answer his question, just asked himself, "What did you find strange about him?"

"He came back in the rain last night, and as soon as he came back, he packed his luggage, paid the bill, and went out. I offered to carry his briefcase, but he didn't want it. He carried the briefcase himself to the elevator. That's why I thought his actions were a little strange."

I felt my heart rate increase. Because the bellboy not only confirmed Zhao Boxiong's identity, but also confirmed that his actions last night did indeed have the possibility of committing the crime. How could I restrain myself from secretly rejoicing when I unexpectedly obtained this unexpected information?

Hawthorne further asked, "Did he look flustered when he left?" The bellboy widened his eyes and nodded, "Yes, he was indeed flustered! After he came back, he didn't say a word, just took care of packing his briefcase; he left as soon as he was packed. I had long suspected that he wasn't on the right path."

"Then, do you know where he moved to?"

"Of course not. I asked him if he wanted me to call a car, but he just shook his head and didn't say a word. Sir, what did he do after all? I had long suspected him."

"Oh, you had long suspected him? Why?" At this time, a man who looked like a pot-bellied merchant, wearing a long gown, a woolen cap, and black beard and glasses, swaggered over from the east end of the corridor. The bellboy seemed a little apprehensive, pursed his lips at Hawthorne, and walked towards the turn at the west end. Of course we followed him, and he whispered in a relatively quiet turning point at the west end exit.

"Sir, there are several things that made me suspicious. Although he lives here alone, he has many friends who come to see him—"

"What kind of people are they?"

"I don't remember clearly. There are people wearing both Chinese-style clothes and Western suits, but they are not very old."

"Does he have a girlfriend?"

"Yes - there is one, and she has stayed overnight here." (67)

Education

### The Highest Institution of Learning in India

— Tao

Santiniketan University in India is located in Santiniketan, and its president is the current Indian poet laureate, Tagore. It used to be just a small school, but after decades of Tagore's management, it has become the world-renowned highest institution of learning in India today.

There are no classrooms in this university; students live in the woods, in clusters of small huts. Several dozen of them form a group, choosing one person to be their leader. When the morning bell rings, they immediately get up, salute the sun, then bathe under the banana trees. After half an hour, they put on white robes, carefully wrap their textbooks in a white cloth, and run to the pre-selected tree. That is their classroom, and the professors are already sitting under the tree waiting for the students' arrival. When the students are all present, they form a semicircle and sit cross-legged on the ground, beginning their lessons amidst the songs of birds and the fragrance of flowers. Most strangely, during class, if students have any questions, even if they are not in the textbook, they can interrupt the professor and stand up to ask. The teachers will also answer as fully as possible. Such seemingly rude behavior from the students is not only not punished, but can even earn the teacher's praise.

Wednesday is their Sabbath, so on this day, the students put on colorful robes and happily run to the temple to worship. Everyone is barefoot, sitting on the floor. President Tagore arrives at the temple gate by car, also takes off his straw sandals, puts on a long robe, and enters. He first sits on a stool and performs a peculiar ritual, then reads the Bible, and then interprets the words of the Bible for the students.

Currently, Santiniketan University has more than eight hundred students. After graduation, they work in twenty-eight countries around the world. Those who graduate and stay in India have been distributed to about a thousand villages!

### Opportunity

When there is no opportunity, create opportunity; when opportunity arises, seize it; never give up opportunity, because opportunity waits for no one. But we must also not wait for opportunity.

### The Mystery Film That Was Thought to Be ### "The Great Dictator" Filming Anecdotes

— Shu Mang

Three Years of Diligent Work Finally Completed / Subtle Portrayals That Are Both Hilarious and Tragic

We have heard about Chaplin's new film "The Great Dictator" for a long time, but during this long period, we have only heard the sound of the escalator but not seen anyone come down. This has made open-minded movie fans all over the world look forward to it with great anticipation. Until recently, Chaplin personally announced that the film has been completely shot and will be premiered in the United States in mid-September. For this film, Chaplin mobilized all the staff of the studio, from actors to craftsmen, working diligently for three years. In addition to countless efforts in the work, he also encountered many difficulties in the environment. Judging from the current situation here and the content of the film, it may be difficult for Shanghai audiences to see this film. Now, I will write down some inhumane trivial matters about the content of the film and all aspects of its production below, which may be what everyone wants to know.

(1) The title of this film has now been officially decided to be "The Great Dictator." However, in Chaplin's studio, everyone does not call it by its title, but refers to it as "Production No. 6."

(2) Chaplin speaks entirely in this film. He plays a small-mustached character that alludes to Hitler, named Adenoids Hinp, meaning "adenoid growths," while Jack Oakie, who plays 　Solini, is named Benzino gasoline in the film, meaning "oil and gasoline," which also means "inflammable material" and "troublemaker."

(3) In addition to Hitler and Mussolini, others such as Goebbels and Goering also appear, and each has incredibly subtle allusive pseudonyms. As for Stalin, he does not appear in the film and there is no allusion to him. According to Chaplin's explanation, this is because he could not find someone whose appearance was similar to his.

(4) Paulette Goddard is still the heroine in this film. She plays a female singer who later becomes Hitler's lover.

(5) During the three-year production process, Chaplin received more than 500 threatening letters from certain parties, as well as many other forms of threats. Because of this, all the staff of the film, from Chaplin downwards, have a considerable amount of accident insurance. In addition to hiring armed guards around the studio, no one is allowed to enter for a visit. In addition to preventing accidents, it is said that there is also a "business eye" effect involved.

(6) Chaplin has strictly blocked the stills, discarded footage, and even production news of this film. Before the official release, absolutely no snippets of the film are allowed to be leaked to the outside world.

(7) Chaplin's efforts for this film exceed any of his past films. He not only wrote, directed, and starred in it, but also created the entire film's musical score himself.

### Recent News of Hollywood Stars

Deanna Durbin stipulates that she works eight hours a day in the studio, but before going to the studio, she must first prepare her daily homework. As for Saturday, that belongs to her lover, Von Paul. On this whole day, Miss Durbin must go out with him.

Mitzi Mayfair has become very popular since she first showed her talent in "Rain." Now, Miss Mayfair wants to introduce her lover, Olivera, to the film industry. It is said that this Mr. Varda has recently undergone a "screen test," and it is likely that we will see the demeanor of Mitzi Mayfair's lover on the screen in the near future.

The Lane family has a total of four daughters, in addition to Priscilla Lane, Rosemary Lane, and Lola Lane who have long served in the film industry, now their eldest sister Leota Lane has also moved from the stage to the screen, so now it is no longer a family of three talents but has added another talent.

Alice Faye was very depressed after divorcing her husband. Because she didn't want to be reminded of the past, she put the house in San Fernando Valley where she used to live with Tony Martin up for sale.

Vivien Leigh's fiancé (they will marry on August 6), Laurence Olivier, has a strange temper, that is, he hates people calling him a "screen lover." However, for other actors, it is something they seek but cannot get.

### The Standard Figure of a Female Star

— Jun Tao

We know that a woman's success as a star has a great relationship with her figure. At least one part of her must have ideal beauty. In terms of the whole body, then Marlene Dietrich, Jean Harlow, Ann Sheridan, etc. can all be said to have the most recently ideal beautiful figure, but they still do not meet the ideal standard. Therefore, various film companies are now searching for an ideal female star whose figure must have Dorothy Lamour's waist, Deanna Durbin's limbs, Dolores del Río's eyes, Loretta Young's mouth, Annabella's nose, Anita Louise's eyebrows, but they have not been able to find one for a while. As for when that will happen, we can only tell you readers at that time! Pan Licila Lane, Rosemary Lane, and Lola Lane have long served in the film industry. Now their eldest sister Leota Lane has also moved from the stage to the screen, so now there are four talents instead of three talents in the family.

### Interesting Things While Watching a Play

— Cheng

The Shanghai Drama School has achieved remarkable results. Yesterday, I went to watch the school's rehearsals, and there were many interesting anecdotes, which I have recorded as follows: The plays performed that day were the complete "Four Plate Mountain" and "Eight Five Flower Cave." The actors were all wearing blue cloth uniforms. Guan Zhengming (male, 14 years old) played Si Lang, without wearing facial makeup, and wore green tiger-head military boots, while his fleshy legs were exposed; Gu Zhengqiu (female, 13 years old) played the princess, with two small braids hanging behind her head, and holding a wooden ruler to represent the child. A beardless Si Lang, paired with a braided princess, was a natural match. Zhou Zhengwen (female, 14 years old) played Empress Xiao. When she appeared, she was guarded by as many as thirty-four people (twenty-two males and twelve females), standing on both sides. The males all had shaved heads, and the females all had short hair. Empress Xiao had yellow court beads hanging around her neck, matched with a blue cloth cheongsam, sitting in the center, like an old Buddha. Zhu Zhengqin (female, 15 years old) played the Empress Dowager. Her hair was black and thick, so shiny that it could be used as a mirror. Zhou Zhengrong (male, 14 years old) played Liu Lang, wearing a pair of thick-soled shoes without shafts, resembling a monk. Peng Zhenglin (male, 14 years old) played Zong Bao, and Yang Zhengshan (female, 14 years old) played Jiao Furen, both bald and without makeup. Although the form was not beautiful, everyone sang and acted very hard, not being sloppy, even the extras running on stage were disciplined and did not have a perfunctory attitude, so the audience all concentrated their attention. "Eight Five Flower Cave" only performed the opening fight due to time constraints, and the sparring was very intense. This is really due to the effective coaching of the school principal Chen Chengyin and the teachers.

### Ti Jie is About to Write and Direct Again ### "Mr. Wang Visits the Funeral Home"

— Feng

Ye Qianyu is famous in the art world for his "Mr. Wang" comics. I remember that the "Mr. Wang" in the Morning Post's Sunday supplement was really popular at the time. Later, Tang Jie, at Tianyi Company, cooperated with Ye Qianyu to bring "Mr. Wang" to the screen, which was of course also a sensation, hailed as the epitome of domestic comedies.

In the past two years, Tang Jie, at the National Union, in addition to playing roles in every film, the films he has starred in are mostly still self-written and directed "Mr. Wang."

Recently, in addition to performing as Qian Duqiao in "Miao Jin Feng" in the guise of "ancient costume Mr. Wang", he is also starting to write "Mr. Wang Visits the Funeral Home." In addition to the consistent comedic style, the film also has detective and horror scenes. It is expected that the film will start shooting at the end of this month.

### Bai Yang in the Air Raid Shelter ### "Seizing the Time"

— Xing

Bai Yang recently sent a letter from Chongqing to a friend in Shanghai, briefly saying that she has not been filming or acting recently, and is quite idle, but there are alarms every day, so it is also quite lively. She also said that whenever an alarm comes, she usually hides in the air raid shelter, with a bundle of wool in her hand, doing some work. She said this is called "seizing the time!" As for the matter of returning to Shanghai, she did not mention it.
