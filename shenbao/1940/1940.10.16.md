### Australian Prime Minister Expresses Hope for Peace; If War Between Britain and Japan is Unavoidable, Australia Cannot Stand Aside

Sydney - Australian Prime Minister Menzies, in a speech here today, stated that Australia has never been at war with Japan, and he earnestly hopes that it will never be so. However, he hopes the world will not think Australia is separate from Britain. If Britain is at war, the Australian people will not stand aside. We wish the Pacific to remain peaceful. However, strange events are now occurring. In the coming months, the progress of arms production will greatly increase. He does not believe any power will attempt to invade Australia.

### US Considers Transferring Aircraft to China to Protect the Yunnan-Burma Road Transport; Large Quantities of Military Supplies Stockpiled on the Burmese Border; Highway to Open the Day After Tomorrow, Allowing for Immediate Transport to China

Washington - According to reliable sources here, the US government, concerned that the reopened Yunnan-Burma Road will inevitably be destroyed by Japanese bombers, is now considering allowing the sale of a number of bombers and fighter planes to China for the purpose of protecting the Yunnan-Burma Road. These aircraft were originally sold by manufacturers to Sweden but have been held here due to the British blockade. It is expected that the government will soon be able to obtain these aircraft based on the bill signed by President Roosevelt on Friday. The bill stipulates that the government may at any time obtain any military supplies that have not yet been delivered, which it deems necessary for national defense. It is reported that there are already more than ten belligerent and non-belligerent countries vying to purchase these aircraft. (International News Service, 15th)

Chongqing - There is considerable welcome here for the possibility that fighter and bomber aircraft ordered by Sweden from the US and currently detained in the US may be resold to China, as China urgently needs aircraft to protect the traffic on the Burma Road, which will reopen on October 18, and inland cities. The lack of aircraft and heavy artillery is also a major reason for the Chinese army's offensive against Japan in Zhan-Sui. Although China currently possesses a strong army, it is only equipped with small arms and lacks the support of aircraft and heavy artillery. It is naturally unable to launch large-scale counter-offensives against the Japanese army, which holds strong defensive fortifications and is covered by aircraft and heavy artillery. (Reuters, 15th)

Rangoon - A large quantity of military supplies, including 300,000 gallons of gasoline from the United States, is now being stockpiled on the Burmese border so that it can be transported into China when the Burma Road reopens on Thursday. At that time, China's ability to resist Japan will once again receive new supplies. Dozens of experts have been deployed in the Rangoon area to arrange everything so that 1,000 American-made trucks can be transported into China at any time. At the same time, there are another 5,000 trucks waiting to be transported on the border, which can set off as soon as the Burma Road reopens. Thousands of Chinese trucks are rich enough to defeat the Japanese plan to bomb the road when it reopens. The military supplies transported by these trucks include aircraft parts, raw materials for the manufacture of gunpowder, and automobile supplies. The unmanufactured raw materials will be transported to manufacturing plants in the foothills near Chongqing. Since Britain closed the Burma Road on July 17 to appease Japan, the Chinese government has been secretly establishing such factories. (United Press, 15th)

Rangoon - According to a report received this morning, the condition of the Burma Road, after spending 1 million kyats to improve it over the past three months, is indeed very good and suitable for use as a transport artery. More than 300 Indian drivers have also been sent to serve on the road. On the Chinese border, armed troops are engaged in protection. In addition to a large number of war materials from the Chinese government, there are also countless building materials waiting to be transported. At present, a large number of goods have been transported to the border, so after the Burma Road reopens, it will only take a few days for a large amount of material to arrive in Chongqing. According to a Burmese official, the goods that have been accumulated here for transport to China in the past three months, based on the close cooperation of the previous Chinese transportation system, can all be transported to China within about one month. The local authorities also stated that they hope that after the road reopens, an average of 500 tons of materials can be transported per month, as in the past, at most 300 tons were transported per month. It is also reported that all bridges and everything else along the road have not only been improved, but also many tunnels have been built, which can not only allow all vehicles to avoid Japanese air raids, but also shorten the journey to Chongqing. In some areas, the highway has been built into a double line, so if one road is bombed, there is still a suitable route for vehicles to travel. Millions of workers will be concentrated along the road, so even if bombed, it can be repaired in just a few hours. In addition, Chinese in Burma will have many volunteers go to work on the road in the next two months to speed up the transport of accumulated goods to China. (United Press, 15th)

Bangkok - According to the Prachachat newspaper, three American cargo ships, fully loaded with munitions, are currently berthed in the Thai military port of Sattahip. According to well-informed sources, the tanks, machine guns, and aircraft listed on the cargo manifest are marked for Thailand, but the ship's certificates state that the cargo will be delivered to the Chinese government in Chongqing. It is said that the cargo ships encountered Japanese warships en route and had no choice but to hand over the goods to Thailand. Thailand does not allow the unloading of these goods. (Haitong, 15th)

### US Sends Two Additional Giant Liners to the Far East to Assist in Evacuating Nationals

Washington - The State Department announced last night that the government has dispatched three giant liners to the Far East to evacuate American nationals from China, Japan, "Manchukuo," Hong Kong, and French Vietnam. The names of the three liners are as follows: the "Washington" of the United States Lines, the "Monterey" and the "Mariposa" of the Matson Navigation Company. (United Press, 15th)

New York - The American Matson Line mail ship "Monterey" received an order from the Maritime Commission to sail from San Francisco to the Far East tomorrow afternoon to assist in the evacuation of American nationals. In addition, the company's "Mariposa" will sail to the Far East on October 30 after arriving in Honolulu from Sydney, and the American mail ship "Washington" will also leave New York for the Far East on Saturday and Sunday, all to carry back American nationals. The three liners can accommodate about 3,000 people in total. (Reuters, 14th)

Washington - It is reported that the American government yesterday abandoned its plan to first evacuate American nationals in the Far East to the Philippines and then return them to the United States from there. The authorities originally intended to first resettle American nationals from China, Japan, "Manchukuo," Hong Kong, and French Vietnam in the Philippines, but later abandoned this plan. The reason for this was based on the experience of evacuating British women and children from Hong Kong to Manila a few days ago. At that time, the reason for evacuating British women and children to Manila was that there were not enough ships available for a while. As for the current US plan to evacuate American nationals, it is to directly carry American nationals from various parts of the Far East back to the United States, and if necessary, it will also evacuate all of Hawaii. The State Department last night declined to comment on the rumor that the Matson Line ships "Mariposa" and "Monterey" would also be sent to the Far East to accelerate the evacuation of American nationals there. Secretary of State Hull has confirmed that the "Washington" and "Manhattan" will sail to the Far East within the week. Observers pointed out that the State Department has not issued an order that all American nationals in the Far East should be evacuated. What the State Department solemnly declared last week was to advise American people to allow their women and children to leave the Far East as soon as possible. (United Press, 15th)

Chongqing - Regarding the US government's preparation to evacuate American nationals in the Far East, it is reported that no instructions have yet been received to evacuate American nationals within Free China. The US Embassy here has not yet learned of any plans to evacuate American nationals in Free China. There are about 150 American nationals residing here, only a few of whom have indicated that they are willing to leave if they receive evacuation instructions. There is currently no US consulate in Chongqing. If American nationals in Free China receive these instructions, they will be issued by the US consulate in Kunming. (Reuters, 15th)

Beijing - According to Japanese semi-official sources, the first group of 100 evacuating American nationals will follow the advice of the US State Department and return home via Shanghai at the end of this month. All of them are family members of US Embassy personnel and employees of American commercial firms here. According to unconfirmed reports, another 250 American women and children are also preparing to evacuate. (Reuters, 15th)

Editorial

### The Inside and Outside of the Tripartite Pact

In recent weeks, domestic and foreign forums have focused on the international impact and reactions following the tripartite pact between Germany, Italy, and Japan. Beyond the obvious facts, there are many conflicting opinions, and no firm conclusion has been reached. Now, let's re-examine the essence of the tripartite pact.

Long before the outbreak of the European war, for two or three years, international rumors repeatedly circulated that the three countries would form an alliance. Moreover, the behind-the-scenes brewing gave people traceable signs at any time. At that time, observations from various parties were not consistent, but most commentators believed that the three countries would not benefit from forming an alliance, so they deduced that the alliance would not be realized. When this resolution was announced, various parties, although not surprised because of its origins, could not help but have doubts: After the alliance, what benefits would Germany and Italy, and Japan, actually gain? After questioning, most people believed that: In the West, because the Japanese fleet could not go to war, the assistance that the alliance could provide to Germany and Italy was not very large after all; in the East, after this alliance, Japan instead aroused the cooperation of China, Britain, and the United States. The benefits that Germany and Italy could provide to Japan were also not great. Therefore, on both the German and Japanese sides, the gains did not outweigh the losses, and the harms outweighed the benefits. Forming an alliance was actually a mistake. This kind of argument is seen everywhere in various countries. In British and American public opinion, it is almost unanimous. After the announcement of the alliance, only within the three countries was there considerable self-promotion, thinking it would add a flourish. Apart from this, it has not been seen to increase the international prestige in the slightest, let alone produce any coercive and deterrent effect. Not only that, but because of boasting widely, it exposed broad ambitions, causing countries in Europe and Asia that were unwilling to accept control to gradually and increasingly tighten their ties. The final move of the alliance is, of course, for the sake of breaking the dream of the so-called new order, uniting to resist this intent to control, and eliminating the root cause of the world's disturbance. This public will, this group force, has formed a vast and strong trend, which cannot be changed or resisted by any means by the aggressors. But then, why didn't the three countries conceal themselves, unaware of avoidance, and openly form an alliance? This must be recognized: They are really forced to ally, this is the last desperate gamble of the aggressive forces on both the East and West sides. Now they are approaching the end of their rope, and they are taking this only risky move. They themselves estimate that the possibility of failure is increasing and becoming certain day by day; and China and Britain, which are resisting on both sides, are exhausting their own strength and continuing to make strong resistance, their spirit soaring, determined to win. What's more, the two major powers, the United States and the Soviet Union, who are outside the war situation, are actively supporting them. This is what Germany and Japan wanted to isolate from China and Britain, but there is no way to do so; the alliance is also an attempt at isolation. Japanese Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka recently said that Germany, Italy, and Japan should have united and formed today's battle line long after successively withdrawing from the League of Nations; it was only because of the weakness of the Japanese diplomatic authorities in the past that it was delayed until now. Is this statement a criticism of his predecessor that Matsuoka dismissed in one stroke? In fact, it is just covering up the traces of having to adopt a final strategy at present. It should be known that the different paths taken by Japanese diplomacy, earlier and later, are a matter of diplomatic strategy. In the past, it was a consistent approach of each going its own way and supporting each other with Germany and Italy. In the past few years, they have achieved amazing results in both the East and West, seizing and plundering cleverly and forcefully. Now, the confidence of surviving alone, winning alone, and swallowing alone has been completely wiped out, forced to the point of short-handed engagement, seeing that it is approaching the line of death, seeking survival in death, they simply unite, regardless of everything. Therefore, it is said that they are really forced to ally.

After the alliance, they hoped to frighten the United States and the Soviet Union from supporting China and Britain. However, they did not know that this would force the United States and the Soviet Union to choose between two clear paths: one is to recognize the "new order" in Europe and Asia, and the other is to accept the challenge and go to war. The original intention of these two countries was to use the widespread American psychology of trying to avoid war, and the Soviet Union's fundamental position of avoiding being involved in the capitalist world war. In all fairness, it is a very vicious diplomatic trick to want to use it in this way. In all fairness, the United States and the Soviet Union are naturally similar. What was beyond their expectations was that after the announcement of the alliance, the United States reacted strongly and increased its aid to China and Britain; the Soviet Union firmly stated that its policy of aiding China would not change, and at the same time promoted diplomatic activity between the United States and the Soviet Union. Although the strong resistance of China and Britain is one aspect; before the United States and the Soviet Union have joined hands and jointly shouldered the important responsibility of stabilizing the world, the international crisis does indeed still exist; this is what the anti-aggression countries and peoples, and the people who love civilization, should be vigilant about.

### Britain and the United States Have Apparently Established a Strong United Front in the Far East; The US Anti-Aggression Attitude Will Strengthen Further; Japan's Previous Arrogance and Subsequent Humility Shows Softening Towards the US

Washington - According to well-informed sources here, anyone who thinks that the United States' tough attitude toward Japan is just a flash in the pan during the presidential election will be disappointed, because after the election on November 5, this attitude in the United States will strengthen and will not show any weakness. President Roosevelt's speech in Dayton is regarded by newspapers everywhere as a clear announcement that the appeasement policy no longer exists. The statement that the United States understands the danger of allowing aggressor countries to nibble away at other countries, and since Japan has openly colluded with European aggressor countries, it will inevitably encounter the same policy from the United States as its Axis friends. The news from Tokyo that Japanese newspapers were greatly surprised after the United States sent ships to carry American nationals in the East did not move the officialdom here, because the US policy is by no means empty threats. Those here who are familiar with the situation in the Far East seem to expect that Japan will step back slightly, knowing that Japan's basic policy does not want to go to war with the United States, which is tantamount to suicide for a country that relies on the import of important raw materials for its survival. No one now believes that Japan dares to do anything to the US or Britain, because Britain and the United States have apparently established a strong, though not formal, united front in the Far East. American newspaper commentators pointed out that the fact that American toughness has changed Tokyo's tone from arrogance to humility in 24 hours. It is said that the bombastic Suma, spokesman for the Japanese Foreign Ministry, who threatened with war, has now suddenly become sweet-tongued and begs for peace. And Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka, who boasted that the Axis pact aimed to fight against countries that advocated maintaining the status quo in the Pacific, has now urgently declared that the pact is not aimed at the United States. What is worrying now is that although the Japanese warlords dare not take action against Britain and the United States, they will vent their anger on Vietnam and completely occupy this country with its demoralized and non-resistant forces. It is heard that Vietnam had previously asked the United States for help, but soon wavered and willingly surrendered. Although the United States holds the best intentions in the world, it cannot provide assistance to countries that are unwilling to help themselves. (Reuters, 14th)

### Japan's Fear is Seen in its Words; Eager to Approach the Soviet Union

Tokyo - Japanese newspapers today again warned the United States that it is currently adopting a "dangerous policy" in the Far East. The "Nichinichi Shimbun" stated that President Roosevelt's speech in Dayton on Columbus Day, in which he reaffirmed US policy, although perhaps specifically addressed to the American people, "in fact shows that the United States is adopting a definite opposing position against the Tripartite Alliance and has decided to join the war." The newspaper stated that if the United States is willing, it can "pull the British chestnuts out of the fire," but warned that once the war breaks out, the United States will have to disperse its fleet all over the world. The newspaper continued, "If so, the current naval warfare situation will be completely changed. It is time for the United States to reconsider its foreign policy." Meanwhile, the "Asahi Shimbun" stated that Japan does not need to worry about the rumored British-American naval and army understanding and British-American suggestions to the Soviet Union. The newspaper said that if the Soviet Union understands Japan, it will "befriend Japan as its neighbor" and "not shake hands with the distant United States." The newspaper stated, "Undoubtedly, the Soviet Union should know that it cannot ignore Japan's naval power. The Soviet Union should also understand that before it obtains Japanese-Soviet relations, it will be extremely difficult for it to continue trading with the United States." The newspaper said, "Japan is prepared to begin negotiations with the Soviet Union with 'openness and candor.' The new ambassador to the Soviet Union, Tatekawa, is currently traveling from Changchun to Moscow and will restart negotiations with the Soviet Union." (United Press, 15th)

### British House of Commons Inquires About Loans to China

London - During today's meeting of the House of Commons, a question was raised asking whether the government would consider providing loans to China under the same export credit loan plan as the recent US government loan to China. Chancellor of the Exchequer Wood replied that there is currently no matter of the British government lending new loans to China under consideration. It is alleged that China has already obtained aid from the United Kingdom under certain export credit loans, and because the pounds obtained under this plan have not yet been exhausted, and only a small part of the export guarantee has been used, the issue of continuing to require pound aid will not arise at present.

### US Naval Aircraft Exercise Night Flight Over the Philippine Islands

Manila - US long-range naval patrol bombers practiced night flight over this area tonight. Naval authorities expect that this type of night exercise will be intensified in the future. (United Press, 15th)

### Japan Evacuates Residents in Britain

Stockholm - It was learned here today that the Japanese ship "Fushimi Maru" will leave a port in southern Ireland at the end of the month to carry all Japanese residents in the British Isles back to their country. Japanese nationals who need to handle important matters and diplomatic matters will remain in the United Kingdom. (Haitong, 15th)

### Part of the Japanese Army Will Withdraw From Vietnam; The Japanese Army in Lang Son Will Be Transferred to Haiphong; France Asks China Not to Send Troops into Vietnam

Hanoi - Japan seems to have decided to withdraw part of its army from French Vietnam to abide by the Franco-Japanese agreement signed in Hanoi on September 22. French sources reported here last night that 10,000 Japanese troops in Lang Son, north of Hanoi, will board trains today or tomorrow to Haiphong to board transport vehicles to leave French Indochina. It is generally pointed out that Lang Son was the site of the fiercest fighting between the French and Japanese armies in border conflicts, where the Japanese army captured thousands of French and indigenous troops and reorganized the French and Vietnamese forces in the area. However, the Japanese army has since released all the captured French officers. The Japanese occupation of Lang Son is a violation of the Hanoi Agreement. It is reported that Vietnamese Governor-General Decoux has shifted his attention south because Thailand is now demanding Vietnam to cede important territories. General Decoux will leave here tomorrow to inspect Annam and Cambodia for ten days and visit the local monarchs in those areas. At the same time, he will also inspect the Vietnamese defense lines near the Thai border. (United Press, 15th)

Hanoi - French Ambassador to China Cosme is now in Hanoi and will travel to Chongqing in the next few days to hold talks with Chinese government leaders. It is reported that Cosme will ask the Chinese government not to send troops into Vietnam, because this action would only further expand the areas occupied by the Japanese in Vietnam. At the same time, the Vietnamese authorities have received instructions from the Vichy government not to allow British ships to dock in Vietnam. (United Press, 15th)

Hong Kong - Royal Airways announced today that it will suspend its flights to Vietnam due to the changing situation in French Vietnam. However, the company stated that it hopes the flights to Vietnam can be restored in 20 days. (United Press, 15th)

### A 70-Year-Old Man in Wengan Saves Money From a Feast to Support the Army

Guiyang - Chen Xianyang, a 70-year-old man from Wengan, and his wife, Ms. He, ordered their daughter to donate 1,000 yuan saved from their 70th birthday feast to comfort the soldiers at the front. The county has submitted a request for commendation to show its encouragement. (15th Telegram)

### France Resolutely Rejects Thailand's Territorial Demands; Plans to Immediately Approve the Non-Aggression Pact and Investigate Border Disputes

Vichy - The French government published an official report last night, resolutely refusing to consider any territorial demands made by Thailand, while also guaranteeing that France is prepared to immediately approve the mutual non-aggression treaty with Thailand. (Reuters, 15th)

Vichy - Regarding Thailand's territorial demands to France, responsible officials here recently announced that the French government has received many notes from that country, among which the territorial demands have been resolutely rejected. The remaining notes relate to the ratification of the mutual non-aggression treaty signed between Thailand and France in June of this year, and the recent disputes on the border between Thailand and French Vietnam. The French government is prepared to immediately exchange the ratification documents of the non-aggression treaty between the two countries. Since the Thai government has not yet received these documents, it intends to send a telegram to Bangkok for promptness. In addition, the French government has also agreed to organize a mixed committee to re-divide some small islands in the Mekong River before the treaty is ratified. This committee must not inquire about other territorial issues. As for the Thai government's request to organize a mixed committee to investigate border disputes (according to reports, a Lao person was shot by a Vietnamese municipal police officer, and the Thai government insists that this person is a Thai citizen), the French government has also expressed its agreement and has fully authorized this committee to also investigate other border disputes that occurred several weeks ago. (Havas, 14th)

Bangkok - The Thai secret society "Thai Blood Group" is actively carrying out an anti-French movement, demanding that the government issue an ultimatum to France, demanding the immediate return of Thailand's lost territories such as Laos, and compensation of 47,000,000 Thai baht. France must also apologize to Thailand. The deadline for the ultimatum must not exceed one week. The "Thai Blood Group" has carried out demonstrations and distributed leaflets. Bangkok is raising funds to recover lost territories, and donations from all parties are very enthusiastic. (Haitong, 15th)

Bangkok - Last night, about 10,000 people held a demonstration here, demanding that the Thai government send an ultimatum to the Vichy government, urging it to immediately accept Thailand's territorial demands on Vietnam. Although the government authorities are more clear-headed on the territorial issue of French Vietnam, the demonstrators are very passionate. Foreign Minister Kuak Yakana told a United Press reporter yesterday that if the demonstrators do not violate the law, the Thai government does not intend to interfere. He Hua claimed, "It is difficult to say whether a third party is instigating this demonstration behind the scenes, but the enthusiasm of the general public for recovering our country's territory is extremely high." He also denied the rumor that Thailand is cooperating with the Three-Power Pact. He said, "Thailand has not been invited to join the Tripartite Alliance, nor does it have any secret agreements with any country. Thailand will never assist the war goals of the signatories to the Three-Power Pact." In recent days, demonstrations have occurred in Bangkok every day, and public sentiment is surging. Thai newspapers have adopted an absolutely nationalistic position, repeatedly demanding that the government immediately take action against Vietnam. (United Press, 15th)

### Japanese Troops in Nanning Area: Invasion Foiled

Guilin: A portion of the Japanese army in Nanning, on the evening of the 12th and at dawn on the 13th, twice launched an invasion towards Baishan along the Yi-Wu road under the cover of artillery fire. Both attempts were bravely repelled by the Chinese army. (Dispatch on the 15th)

### Soviet Garrison in Romanian Ceded Territory Moves Towards Danube Delta: 20 Soviet Divisions Conduct Maneuvers; Rumors of Conflict Between Soviet and German Troops

Bucharest: According to sources here, troops moving out from Bessarabia, the recently ceded territory by Romania, have been advancing south, apparently undertaking the occupation of the entire Danube Delta leading into the Black Sea. It is rumored that German and Soviet troops have clashed near the city of Galati on the Danube River (near the intersection of Bessarabia and mainland Romania). Simultaneously, the Soviet Union has amassed 20 army divisions on the Romanian border. According to official statements, these troops are engaged in "maneuvers." German elite troops, supplemented by motorized units and aircraft, are currently entering Romanian territory. At present, German forces have established a tight defense on the west bank of the Prut River, which serves as the new border with Romania. It is said that German forces have publicly declared that their presence there is to prevent further Soviet advances. Furthermore, according to reliable sources, the German "military mission" may soon see a significant increase. It is widely believed that the current concentration of German forces in Romania has the immediate objectives of targeting the Dardanelles and Syria. If Turkey is invaded, it will fight to the end. This attack will trigger resistance from the three Islamic nations of Egypt, Syria, and Turkey. It is reported that all Turkish expatriates have received notices to conclude all affairs before November 1st, so that they can quickly leave the country in case of an emergency. Military sources here have told people that Soviet motorized troops and the air force are undertaking significant operations along the Crimean coast. There are also reports of a large concentration of Soviet warships in the vicinity. Soviet troops stationed around Odessa have been ordered to move south and southeast. It is also rumored that Soviet troops have invaded south and have crossed the Kilia branch of the Danube River, which is the northernmost part of the delta, and have advanced to Sulina, a place in the central part of the delta. The Soviet action appears to be aiming to place the entire Danube Delta, including the Saint George channel, the southernmost part of the delta, under its military control. Since the news of the clash between German and Soviet troops near Galati emerged, it is said that the Soviet Union has dispatched four additional heavy ironclad warships to strengthen its river fleet. The Soviet Union now has twelve armed warships in the area and has installed heavy artillery at Reni, 20 miles downstream from Galati. Although various assurances have been reported, stating that Germany's occupation of key locations in Romania is with Moscow's consent, the unease felt by Soviet personnel here is quite evident. Moreover, the German "mission" seems poised for a significant increase soon. Although Soviet personnel here still insist on accepting Germany's official explanation, any offensive increase by German forces beyond this point will undoubtedly provoke a reaction from Moscow. The Soviet intelligence agency here is fully aware that the German "mission" has begun training the Romanian army and is conducting precise air defenses around key railway junctions outside Bucharest and around areas of oilfields most vulnerable to attack. According to sources from Bessarabia, the Soviet authorities have acknowledged the presence of 20 army divisions amassed outside the Romanian border but claim they are for training exercises. Newspapers here last night published lengthy reports from French newspapers, emphatically stating that the Soviet Union is currently observing developments in the Balkans but may not take any action unless its own interests are directly threatened. As for the strength of the Communist Party in Romania, it is difficult to estimate. The general population of Romania fears the possibility of Soviet occupation, and in view of the two powers standing side by side, they cannot help but feel a terror that Romania will eventually become a battlefield for the Soviet Union and Germany. (Reuters dispatch on the 15th)

Bucharest: Yesterday, the German military delegation laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Romanian Unknown Soldier in Carol Park. The German Ambassador to Romania, Dr. Fabricius, and representatives of the Nazi Party's foreign branch participated. The delegation also laid a wreath at the Tomb of the German Soldiers Killed in Action in World War I. (Haitong dispatch on the 15th)

Bucharest: Sixty German pilots arrived here yesterday, and a German three-engine aircraft flew over Bucharest. (Reuters dispatch on the 15th)

London: The London Daily Express published a report today stating that Germany has concentrated 10, 15, or 20 army divisions in Romania. A report from Bucharest states that German forces are now sending submarines into several areas of the Danube River and that German submarines will gather at Romanian shipyards for use in the Black Sea. (International dispatch on the 15th)

Istanbul: A certain Turkish newspaper says that the Axis powers have begun large-scale operations, the purpose of which is not yet known. However, the first stage is to place an obstacle between the Soviet Union and the area of disturbance. Germany, having occupied Romania, now reaches the Black Sea and advances like a dagger towards the side of the Soviet Union. From this fact, it can be inferred that the Axis powers intend to raise issues closely related to the Soviet Union, and these issues are obviously none other than the Balkan Peninsula, Istanbul, and the Straits. (Reuters dispatch on the 15th)

Soviet Union Issues Statement: Denies Five-Nation Talks

Moscow: According to a statement recently released by TASS, the British newspaper "Daily Telegraph Morning Post" recently carried a Reuters news report claiming that the Soviet Union, Great Britain, Turkey, Yugoslavia, and Greece are conducting negotiations regarding the issue of German eastward expansion. TASS has now been officially authorized to state that this report is completely inconsistent with the facts and is purely "a new invention of wishful thinking by the Daily Telegraph Morning Post." (TASS dispatch on the 15th)

Moscow: Moscow newspapers commented on the German-Italian-Japanese alliance, stating that the neutrality repeatedly declared by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov will remain the cornerstone of Soviet policy. "Pravda" recently devoted three long columns to criticizing the Soviet publication of Bismarck's autobiography, mentioning Bismarck's statement that there has never been a historical conflict between Russia and Prussia. Regarding Soviet-Japanese relations, Molotov and Matsuoka have both expressed their intention to enhance friendly relations. Soviet officials do not express opinions to journalists on the Balkan issue but merely relay news of German troops entering Romanian territory. However, the Soviet Union recently stated that it cannot remain indifferent to changes in the international navigation regulations on the Danube River. This statement shows the Soviet Union's concern for the Balkans, especially the Danube River. Moscow newspapers have all disclosed but not criticized the speech given by US President Roosevelt in Dayton on Saturday. (Reuters dispatch on the 14th)

Turkish Authorities Advise Expatriates in Romania to Evacuate

Bucharest: Turkish authorities have announced that they will fulfill all obligations to Greece and have warned their expatriates in Romania to leave the country before November 1st. Therefore, the situation in the Balkans is becoming more tense today. Turkish Ambassador to Romania, Tanrıöver, has informed the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs that Turkey is prepared to fulfill its responsibilities to Greece. Reports from London indicate that 500,000 Turkish and Greek troops have been concentrated on the Bulgarian border. Diplomatic circles here are secretly spreading rumors that Turkey and Greece recently signed a secret military agreement. At the same time, it is reported that German forces in Romania continue to expand. (International Press dispatch on the 15th)

Istanbul: According to speculation here, the Istanbul press has received hints from Moscow or Ankara that Turkey is not willing to see articles that doubt German-Soviet friendship. The Tan newspaper, which has always been anti-German and Italian, recently published an article explaining why Moscow did not protest the entry of German troops into Romania. The Yeni Sabah newspaper also wrote an article expressing regret to the Soviet Russian newspaper. (Haitong Press dispatch on the 15th)

Istanbul: Although the German occupation of Romania is enough to make people uneasy, Turkey is now calmly awaiting developments. Opinions still differ regarding the purpose of the German forces. One view is that the German occupation of Romania is to prevent the alliance of Britain, Turkey, and the Soviet Union through the Balkans, so the German forces took preemptive action, occupying Romania as a precaution. Another view is that this move by the German forces is part of the Axis powers' declared will to gain control of the Mediterranean. If this is the case, then Turkey must guard against the German forces forcibly crossing the straits and Anatolia, and Greece will be in danger of being invaded from both Bulgaria and Albania. Turkish political circles say that if German forces attempt to attack Turkey, there are two difficulties: (1) The attitude of the Soviet Union; if German forces invade the straits, the Soviet Union will definitely not stand idly by. (2) The Turkish army. Turkey has taken military preparations to prevent attacks from the Balkans. Turkey's position is well known and cannot be changed, that is, Turkey will resist any attack on its territory and independence. Diplomatic circles predict that if Romania is transformed into a potential base for attacking the Mediterranean, then military cooperation between Britain and Turkey will inevitably become closer.

Germany Instructs Romania to Avoid Conflict with Britain

London: According to neutral diplomatic circles here last night, Hitler has ordered Romania to avoid a rupture with Britain, attempting to prevent Britain from bombing Romanian oilfields. It is reported that Romania has been ordered to "begin reconciliation with Britain." Neutral diplomatic circles here believe that this result may prevent the breakdown of British-Romanian relations. It is understood that Hitler's directive aims to maintain the appearance of Romania's independence. It is believed here that the five Chinese nationals detained for suspected sabotage will be released, and the 14 British ships detained in the Danube River in June this year may also be returned to their owners as a show of goodwill on the Romanian side.

Budapest: Unofficial sources here believe that the scope of the German occupation of Romania will greatly expand this week. German troop units heading to Romania passed through the outskirts of Budapest at the end of the week. The Hungarian side had originally hoped that the Axis powers would force Romania to cede the remaining land of Outer Transylvania, but now they are disappointed, which shows Germany's ambiguous attitude towards Hungary. The harsh terms of the trade agreement recently concluded between Germany and Hungary have also startled the Hungarians. It is widely believed that this trade agreement stipulates the scope of Hungarian exports to Germany within the next three years. (Reuters dispatch on the 15th)

Beef, once abundantly produced in the province of Baragan, is now impossible to purchase, as the German minority there is monitoring and transporting all that is in stock to Germany. The prices of other foods and fuels are also extremely high. (Reuters dispatch on the 15th)

Romanian Leader Announces Government Construction Plan

Berlin: Romanian leader General Antonescu, in an interview with Hermann, a reporter from the "People's Observer" stationed in Bucharest, stated that the main mission of the Romanian Iron Guard movement is to establish a new leadership class. After the old leadership class, based on aristocracy, was eliminated with the social revolution of land reform, Romanian political leaders failed to establish a new leadership class. Romanian youth resolutely fought against this old situation. The current construction plan of the Romanian government has the following key points: (1) Develop the national defense industry and industries beneficial to the people, increase agricultural production, improve agricultural tools, and open up arable land. (2) Provide all citizens with the opportunity to participate in national affairs. (3) Stipulate minimum wages, distribute profits to workers, build low-cost housing, and establish cooperative organizations. (4) Resolve the Jewish issue with drastic measures, confiscate Jewish land, and exclude Jewish farmers. (5) Implement a diplomatic policy of close contact with the Axis countries. The Balkan alliance has perished along with the entire alliance system, and Romania will no longer utilize this alliance. (6) The Romanian people respect and praise German culture, administrative organization, and technical efficiency, and regard them as factors for building future life. The German minority within Romania will constitute a bridge for relations with Germany. Romania, ruled by the Iron Guard, will cooperate closely with Germany and Japan.

### Kunming Air Raid: Damage Not Severe

Chongqing: When Japanese aircraft in multiple waves bombed Kunming on the 10th and 13th of this month, Mr. Steele, a Far East correspondent for the American "Chicago Tribune," happened to be there and personally experienced the events. He arrived here by air today and said that when Kunming was last subjected to air raids, nineteen out of ten citizens left the city to take refuge, with only a few brave ones remaining in the city. At that time, several large buildings were hit by Japanese bombs, but the damage they suffered was almost less than the value of the bombs dropped by the Japanese aircraft. The rumors outside of how serious the damage was in the area were actually due to the fact that those communicating the message deliberately exaggerated the account. I also gained a considerable impression when I previously traveled by car from Haiphong to Kunming, and I deeply felt that if the Japanese army attempted to invade Yunnan from Vietnam, they would definitely encounter significant resistance.

Although the Tripartite Pact is not as frightening as it was when first announced, people here are showing signs of panic because the Japanese ordered the re-evacuation of Japanese women and children before October 14. Rumors spread this weekend that the Japanese authorities had ordered all Japanese people here to evacuate in two weeks, but these rumors have been denied by the Japanese side.

### Fierce Air Raid on London Suburbs Again Yesterday Morning; German Planes Dropped Oil Bombs, Causing Numerous Fires; Both Inner and Outer Air Defenses Resisted Strongly

London: Last night, German bombers attacked London. Searchlights shone in the sky, and hundreds of anti-aircraft guns fired in unison. British fighter planes also intercepted the enemy planes, causing the buzzing of aircraft and the intermittent rattling of machine guns to resound throughout the night over London. Both inner and outer defenses of London were activated. Some areas were hit by incendiary bombs, causing fires. Enemy planes also flew to other parts of Britain, but details are not yet known. Both inner and outer defenses of London were activated. Some areas were hit by incendiary bombs, causing fires. Enemy planes also flew to other parts of Britain, but details are not yet known. In the London area, a restaurant and a cinema caught fire. Fortunately, the air defense teams worked bravely and extinguished the flames. A bomb hit a Catholic church in the London area, and there are likely to be some casualties. The enemy planes attacked indiscriminately, dropping bombs blindly. The anti-aircraft fire became even fiercer. A high-explosive bomb was dropped on a residential area in a town on the southeast coast last night, and four bodies have now been recovered from the rubble of the destroyed houses. After the German planes attacked the university the previous night, there was only small-scale German air activity during the day yesterday, all by single aircraft, which darted to several locations in southern England and the Midlands, dropping a few bombs. According to a joint statement issued last night by the Ministry of Aviation and the Ministry of Home Security, reports received up to 5:00 PM indicated that the number of casualties was minor. Several houses and shops were destroyed in a town in Kent, and the damage elsewhere was minor. (Reuters dispatch from the 15th)

London: Yesterday, a German four-engine giant bomber was shot down in an open area outside London. According to reliable sources, an enemy plane flew to the outskirts of London, and the anti-aircraft gunners opened fire. The plane dived from an altitude of 5,000 feet and dropped bombs. Another German bomber flew to the suburbs and was driven back by anti-aircraft fire. Yesterday morning, during the alarm, a small squadron of enemy bombers was seen flying alone towards London. In one area, enemy planes flew in, and the artillery fire was very intense. Yesterday afternoon, in a town in East Anglia, an enemy plane flew in and dropped five bombs, causing damage to houses and some casualties. The air raid lasted only ten seconds. (Reuters dispatch from the 15th)

London: Last night and this morning, low-flying German fighter planes and bombers carried out the most brutal air raids since the war began, further increasing the devastation of the already battered London. This bombing can be said to be one of the most horrific pages in the history of air raids. Looking back at dawn, one saw broken beams and collapsed pillars, collapsed houses, and bomb craters in the roads everywhere. Some houses had collapsed into the roads, as if emptying the contents of boxes and baskets. The first wave of German planes to invade London dropped all the well-known German bombs, as well as a new type. Some roads were covered in oil slicks after the German planes dropped oil bombs. It was reported that a German plane flew low over a certain area, which was the first time that low-level bombing of London had been carried out during a night raid. A former British Air Force officer said that he had never seen such low-level bombing of the British capital before. Yesterday's bombing was mainly aimed at London, and the Ministry of Aviation reported that the bombing of other areas of Britain was not as severe as the air raid on Sunday night. There was a brief pause during the first bombing, as if the German planes had exhausted the deadly explosives they were carrying. However, during the second air raid, although the German planes flew higher and showed great caution, their intensity was greater than before. Less than an hour after the second pause, there was a third air raid, but it was not as intense as the first two. A huge store with famous qualifications, a famous church, a hotel familiar to American tourists, a club, a theater, a crowded cinema, and a crowded hotel were all directly bombed. An incendiary bomb penetrated the glass roof of a hotel and fell into the hotel's main hall, where a large group of travelers were sitting together drinking and listening to a string orchestra. When the people caught sight of it, they jumped forward, picked up a chair, and tried to put out the fire. Other hotel staff came to help when they heard the noise. Within minutes, the fire was extinguished. At this time, all the travelers stood by and watched, while the string orchestra continued to play. Several floors of a club in the east were pierced by high-explosive bombs, and the library was damaged. When the bombs hit the cinema and caused a fire, the audience felt the building shaking. The police rushed in and advised everyone to sit still and not move. Everyone continued to watch the movie for about two minutes, and then the police ordered everyone to leave through the side door in an orderly fashion. By this time, the fire had been extinguished. In a nearby city last night, fourteen bombs fell within a few seconds, apparently ejected from a bomb rack. This basic type of bomb was first used in London on Sunday night. Although workers were busy all night clearing away the debris, traffic was temporarily difficult to resume due to the many potholes in the road surface, delaying the time for thousands of people to travel to work. (United Press dispatch from the 15th)

Berlin: A correspondent for the Maritime News Agency recently learned that German planes dropped a total of 160 tons of bombs on London in the past 24 hours, 20 tons of which were dropped during the day and the rest at night. (Dispatch from the Maritime News Agency on the 15th)

### British Air Force Bombs Berlin and Le Havre; Significant Damage to Le Havre Port

London: According to an announcement, several important military targets in Berlin were bombed by the British Air Force day and night yesterday. The oil refineries in Stettin, Magdeburg, and Duisburg were also attacked. The attack on Stettin was particularly effective. A strong British bomber squadron also attacked Le Havre. Judging from the explosions and large fires that occurred, the damage must have been very significant. Bad weather made it difficult for other British planes to find their main targets, so they dropped bombs on shipyards in Hamburg and Dunkirk, railway traffic and factories in Göttingen and Hanover, and multiple airfields before returning. According to a statement issued by the Ministry of Aviation, four planes were lost during the above-mentioned air raids and coastal command aircraft's daytime patrols. (Reuters dispatch from the 15th)

Berlin: Last night, three British planes attempted to bomb Berlin and were shot down by German fighter planes on the way. Several British planes darted into Berlin from northern Germany and dropped many bombs, destroying many houses and the famous Virchow Hospital. Fortunately, no one was killed or injured.

Military objectives in London were bombed by German planes day and night yesterday. There was a huge explosion and a large fire broke out in the Hyde Park area. An airfield north of London was hit. German planes carried out low-level attacks on military camps in southern England, and the fire was so bright that it could be seen even in the middle of the English Channel. Last night, enemy planes invaded German airspace and German-occupied areas. German anti-aircraft guns and fighter planes were very active, so they could not drop bombs at their leisure. Military facilities were not damaged, only civilians were killed. The Rudolf Virchow Hospital in Berlin, despite its prominent Red Cross markings, was bombed again by British planes, and a large bomb was dropped. The ports of Holland and Le Havre were bombed by British planes, and many houses were destroyed. In total, the enemy lost six planes yesterday, and Germany lost one plane.

### American Legion Supports U.S. Policy of Evacuating Nationals; To Hold Meeting Tonight and Express Its Attitude by Telegram; U.S. Sends Two Additional Ships to Assist in Evacuation Efforts

Members of the American Legion in this city are scheduled to meet at the American Club at 8:45 PM tonight to discuss several important matters during the annual election of officers. It is reported that the meeting will pay close attention to the evacuation of American nationals in China. It is also reported that the association may draft a telegram to the national headquarters of the American Legion, supporting the U.S. government's actions and policies regarding the evacuation of American nationals in the Far East, and strongly advocating that the U.S. government should consistently implement its current policies in order to clarify the situation in the Far East. The meeting on Wednesday will discuss these important matters in addition to the annual election of officers, so a large turnout is expected.

Two More Ships Sent to Far East Expediently

The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reported that the U.S. Maritime Commission had already ordered the "Washington" and "Manhattan" to sail to the Far East to evacuate American nationals. News came today (the 15th) that the "Mariposa" and "Monterey" of the Matson Navigation Company will also follow suit and come to Shanghai to assist in the evacuation. American nationals in Shanghai who have expressed their desire to seize the opportunity to leave Shanghai early are pleased to hear this news. At the same time, American nationals also understand that officials in Washington hope that American citizens here will heed the State Department's advice and leave the war-torn East before conflicts arise. A major American businessman said that he believed that American women, children, and non-essential men should leave here as soon as possible, as the United States is bound to have a decisive battle in the Far East.

American Community Groups Spare No Effort to Assist

An official of the American Chamber of Commerce in this city told reporters that the authorities are currently seriously considering a special reduction in travel expenses for the evacuation of American nationals. Although there are no definite measures yet, a decision is expected to be reached within a few days. It is reported that in addition to the American Chamber of Commerce, another American organization is also working on general measures for the evacuation of American nationals, and both organizations are doing their utmost to expedite the process. American officials here hope to avoid repeating the mistakes of the European American nationals, who were evacuated only after the outbreak of war.

U.S. Consul States No Official Report Received Yet

American Acting Consul General in Shanghai, Mr. Butrick, stated this morning that he had not yet received official news regarding the dispatch of the two Matson ships to evacuate American nationals in the Far East. However, there is no doubt that this is true. He did not intend to make any comments until he received official information on the matter. It is reported that the Matson Navigation Company in Shanghai was previously represented by Jardine, Matheson & Co., but since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, Matson ships have no longer sailed to Shanghai, so there is no longer a management office in Shanghai.

Booked Cabins Exceed One Thousand People

It is not known exactly how many responses the U.S. Consulate in this city has received to the notices it issued two days ago advising evacuation. However, since the replies were all mailed, it is hoped that most of them will be received today. The U.S. Consulate is trying to contact every American national in Shanghai, so within a few days, notices will also be sent to unregistered American nationals. It is not known how many American nationals have made preliminary preparations for evacuation. It is only heard that more than one thousand people have booked cabins with the American President Lines. It is expected that this number will double or more after the U.S. Consulate receives replies from all American nationals who are leaving.

First Ship Could Arrive by the End of the Month

According to an official message received yesterday by the American President Lines in this port, the four giant mail ships, the "Washington," "Manhattan," "Monterey," and "Mariposa," which have been ordered to come to the Far East to transport American nationals back to their country, will arrive in Shanghai. The "Monterey" of the American President Lines will be the first to arrive in Shanghai, scheduled for the 30th of this month. The remaining three ships will arrive successively every ten days. After the "Monterey" arrives in Shanghai, it will transport the first batch of American nationals who are evacuating from this port, via Hong Kong and Australia, to San Francisco. Definite measures regarding the reduction of fares are expected to arrive here today or tomorrow. According to officials of the American President Lines, although the four giant ships that are about to arrive in Shanghai are spacious, the situation of "demand exceeding supply" among American nationals here may mean that all four ships will be fully booked.

American Nationals in the Upper Reaches of the Yangtze Come to Shanghai

American nationals and family members of officials in North China and the upper reaches of the Yangtze River are also rapidly making arrangements for evacuation. According to reliable sources obtained by the Dazhong News Agency, naval dependents in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River were transported to Shanghai yesterday afternoon at 5:00 PM by the "Luzon" and "Isabel." One of the two ships berthed at the Citibank pontoon on the Bund, and the other berthed at the British pontoon. American nationals in North China will be transported to Shanghai by the large transport ship "Gold Star," which is expected to arrive tomorrow. Therefore, the flagship "Augusta" will postpone its departure until the "Gold Star" arrives in Shanghai before setting sail for a certain destination.

### First Batch of Japanese Nationals in Hong Kong Evacuated; Taking the "Nitta Maru" to Shanghai en route to Japan

Since relations between Japan and the United States and Britain have become strained, Japanese nationals in Hong Kong have been making preparations for evacuation. The first batch of fifteen Japanese employees and family members of commercial firms in Hong Kong took the regular mail ship "Nitta Maru" of the Nippon Yusen Kaisha via Shanghai, departing the day before yesterday for Kobe, and then transferring to their respective hometowns.

### Shanghai's 200 Million Yuan in Floating Capital Urgently Needs to Be Moved Inland Voluntarily; The Government Should Also Formulate Incentive Measures

Since the United States has strengthened its Far Eastern policy, the international situation has been changing rapidly. Future developments deserve attention. A reporter from the Dazhong News Agency yesterday interviewed a local financier in this port to inquire about his views on the economic situation. According to him, since the outbreak of the Incident, wealthy merchants and tycoons in the occupied areas have flocked to Shanghai with their capital. As a result, the amount of floating capital in this port has increased sharply. According to experts, the amount of floating capital in this port recently reached a staggering 200 million yuan, which is truly alarming. Therefore, banks have reduced deposit interest rates, and the government has repeatedly decided to encourage the movement of capital inland. One reason is to promote production in the interior and increase resistance efforts, and another is to prevent capital from being seized by others. However, only a limited number of people have voluntarily moved their capital inland. Now that the situation in Shanghai is extremely serious, in order to prevent problems before they occur, the only way is to quickly find a way to transport this huge amount of floating capital to the interior. The government should also formulate incentive measures for the movement of floating capital inland as soon as possible. Even if it is enforced, it would not be excessive. If this can be done, then even if Shanghai is controlled by others in the future, it will be futile.

### Rumors of a Serious Incident; "Shengjing" Returns; Possible Concealed Time Bomb; One Account Claims Theft of Maps and Hijacking

The "Shengjing," a North China liner of the British-owned Taikoo Dockyard & Engineering Company, with a cargo capacity of 2,999 tons, weighed anchor yesterday at noon, loaded with cargo and passengers for Weihaiwei, Yantai and Tianjin. Unexpectedly, at four o'clock in the afternoon, there were rumors that it had turned back, saying that the company had received a secret report that among the cargo on board were

Time Bombs

Therefore, a telegram was sent ordering it to return to Shanghai. It was also said that the ship had collided with a ship from a certain country in the Tongsha waters, causing damage. A report was sent back to Shanghai to return for repairs. There were also rumors of the discovery of passengers who were planning to steal maps and hijack the ship, etc. The rumors were varied and confusing. When asked about this with the company, they kept a secret. Observing the situation, it was indeed serious, because the company had ordered the laborers to wait and prepared many barges to unload the more than 5,000 pieces of cargo on the "Shengjing"

Immediately

and store them in godown No. 6 for examination one by one. At first, it was said that it could return to Shanghai at six o'clock, but it had not been seen by seven o'clock. There were also rumors that the company had telegraphed to the ship but had not received a reply, and the company was therefore hesitant. The French Concession authorities, as well as the Customs and Port Police Station (i.e., the water police station), and the Customs fireboat, were very concerned about the ship's arrival in Shanghai and notified the Customs at Wusongkou and the Bund watchtower to report at any time. However, up to late last night, the ship had not returned to Shanghai. What exactly happened will be reported again. It was also heard that Tong Zhiling, Li Yanzao, and others who were performing at the Golden Theatre were also on the ship heading north.

### Hua Jun Chen Zongyao's Troops Decisively Defeat Japanese Army; Japanese Army Suffers Heavy Losses

The Hua Jun guerrilla unit at the junction of Songjiang, Wujiang, Qingpu, Kunshan, Jiashan counties, after Tian Xiushan led his troops to the Hangzhou-He area and contacted friendly forces, the area was entirely under the command of Chen Zongyao's troops. The officers and soldiers of Chen's regiment were determined and resolute, based on advantageous terrain, and familiar with waterways, every time they engaged the Japanese army, they inflicted heavy losses on them. At the beginning of the month, a certain two companies of Chen's regiment were stationed in the Yangsha Pit area and encountered a Japanese army

Launching a land attack

The Hua Jun sentries shot and killed one Japanese army captain and one soldier, and captured one Zhuan rifle and one Type 38 rifle. Knowing that the Hua Jun was prepared, the Japanese army immediately retreated. On a certain afternoon of the previous month at 1 p.m., three Japanese gunboats attempted to land sneakily at Beizhao Village. Regiment Commander Chen personally led his guards to command his troops to fight back, sinking one Japanese gunboat, killing three Japanese captains and fifty or sixty soldiers. The Japanese army retreated in defeat to Jinze Town, and that night

Cremated the corpses

And burned down many villages near Xinta Town, causing great harm to the people. In a few days, two more Japanese gunboats came to the Hua Jun defense area and were attacked by Chen's troops. The two sides fought fiercely for two hours, but the Japanese army could not land and fled. At 3 p.m., five more Japanese warships came and attacked from different directions. Chen's troops resisted head-on with the first company, while other companies surrounded the Japanese army on all sides. After three or four hours of fierce fighting, the Japanese army still failed and scattered in defeat. In this battle, the Japanese army suffered forty or fifty casualties. The Hua side used

Careful arrangement

With absolutely no losses. Until about 9 a.m. the day before yesterday, more than twenty small Japanese warships surrounded and attacked the Hua Jun defense area. The Hua Jun calmly fought back. After three hours of stalemate, although the Japanese army continued to increase, they were ultimately defeated by the Hua Jun's desperate and courageous charge, and the entire army broke through without suffering significant damage. The Japanese side suffered heavy casualties. Furthermore, on the 8th of this month, a certain unit of Chen's regiment encountered four Japanese gunboats near Guanzizhen, and the two sides engaged in battle for about two hours. The Japanese army retreated without success, while the Hua side suffered one soldier killed and one wounded.

The Central Trust Bureau, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications, the three banks, in order to facilitate the encashment of principal, interest, and dividends of savings certificates by certificate holders, have recently formulated the following measures for the mutual exchange of jointly issued savings certificates by the three banks: (1) In order to facilitate the encashment of jointly issued savings certificates by certificate holders, except for areas with restricted remittances, certificate holders may request the local head office, branch offices, or their agent banks to encash principal, interest, and dividends. (2) Certificate holders for mutual exchange of jointly issued savings certificates may choose either of the following two methods for encashment: 1. Collection exchange; 2. Guaranteed exchange. (3) The procedures for collection exchange are as follows: 1. The certificate holder should fill out the "Application Form for Collection Exchange of Thrifty National Construction Savings Certificates" (if the type A certificate has a retained seal, the original seal should also be signed and affixed on the application form), together with the savings certificate, and submit it to the exchange bank or bureau for a "Temporary Receipt for Collection Exchange of Thrifty National Construction Savings Certificates". 2. The exchange bank or bureau will send the original certificate to the original issuing office for verification. After receiving a reply confirming that it is correct (the certificate holder may apply for a telegram reply, but the telegram fee shall be borne by the certificate holder), they will notify the applicant to collect the money. The applicant should submit the temporary receipt. (4) The procedures for guaranteed exchange are as follows: 1. The certificate holder should find a reliable guarantor, fill out a guarantee form, and fill out an application form for collection exchange of thrifty national construction savings certificates (if the type A certificate has a retained seal, the original seal should also be signed and affixed on the application form). 2. After the exchange bank or bureau verifies that the guarantor is reliable and completes the counter-guarantee without error, it will immediately pay the amount according to the submitted savings certificate. 3. The exchange bank or bureau will send the original certificate to the original issuing office for verification. If it is found to be correct, the guarantor will be notified to retrieve the guarantee form. If it is found to be an erroneous payment, the guarantor should immediately be responsible for returning all principal, interest, and dividends, as well as other losses.

The procedures shall be handled in accordance with Article 3 or 4. (6) A remittance fee should be charged to the certificate holder for mutual exchange of savings certificates, but it may be appropriately reduced depending on the size of the certificate amount.

### Cargo Destined for Rangoon; Transshipped via Singapore; The Yunnan-Burma Road is Open and Shanghai Goods Begin to Ship; Huge Amounts of Passenger and Cargo Goods Detained in Haiphong are Confiscated

The Yunnan-Burma Road is now open, and merchants are paying close attention to freight transportation. However, there are no regular liners on the Shanghai-Burma route, and most shipments are transshipped through Hong Kong and Singapore. Singapore is considered more convenient. This shipping route is exclusively operated by the British Great American Steamship Company in this city, because the company has a close relationship with the British Royal Family and enjoys special rights and interests. The British Taikoo Company in this city has already undertaken the transportation of goods to Rangoon, but all must be transshipped to Singapore. The first batch consisted of a small amount of cargo to Rangoon on the Suiyang Wheel on the 5th of this month, transshipped through Singapore. Today, the Suzhou Wheel is carrying over 590 pieces of cargo to Rangoon, to be transported to Singapore.

Chinese Losses; Exceed Ten Million Yuan

Regarding the goods blocked in the warehouses of Haiphong, they have been inspected since the Japanese army landed. It is reported that a certain company's warehouse had 150 boxes of machine parts worth 3 million yuan, and a certain trading house had western medicine stored in Haiphong, all of which have now been confiscated. The transport trucks and goods of the Southwest Transportation Company that failed to transport to Yunnan and were detained in Haiphong have also been seized. Therefore, the losses of various industries are immeasurable. The local overseas Chinese have all been notified by the Chinese Consul in Vietnam to evacuate, so the Chinese businessmen's trading houses and transportation companies have successively carried out liquidation and termination work. From now on, trade between Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Vietnam will become increasingly cold. Overseas Chinese are rushing to Southeast Asia or waiting for ships to return to Hong Kong and Shanghai and then return to the country. The direct and indirect losses suffered will exceed ten million yuan. As for the passengers and goods blocked in Saigon, arrangements have been made to load them onto ships and return them to Hong Kong and Shanghai. All return procedures are being expedited.

Southwest Parcels; May Need to be Registered First

Recently, many parcel merchants and merchants from various industries have sent personnel to the General Post Office on North Suzhou Road to inquire about the methods for sending southwest parcels, hoping that the bureau will resume acceptance as soon as possible in the short term after the opening of the Yunnan-Burma Road. However, according to a senior postal official of the bureau speaking to the "New Voice News Agency", the bureau is also aware that the suspension of acceptance of southwest parcels for five months has affected the entire commercial sector of Shanghai, but due to transportation difficulties, it has been unable to resume acceptance. Now that the Yunnan-Burma Road is about to open, the bureau has not officially decided on the date for resuming the acceptance of southwest parcels. Once negotiations are completed, it will announce the resumption successively. It is expected that there will be a large number of people sending parcels at that time, and either advance registration or restrictions on the number of items sent will be implemented.

### Coal Merchants Admit; Stockpiles are Abundant; Incoming Shipments Arrive Constantly; No Fear of a Coal Shortage This Winter

The Shanghai Times reported that the coal merchants in charge of coal imports told reporters yesterday (14th) that the rumors of anxiety in the Shanghai coal market are not true. The current coal reserves are sufficient for at least six weeks, and coal from various places is expected to arrive constantly, so there is no fear of a coal shortage this winter. However, freight rates are currently very high, so coal prices may continue to increase.

### Second Phase of Construction Gold Bond; To be Issued Next Month

The National Government, in order to raise funds for construction projects, is issuing the Republic of China Twenty-Ninth Year Construction Gold Bonds: (1) The amount of the British Gold Bond is set at 10 million British gold pounds; (2) The amount of the US Gold Bond is set at 50 million US dollars, to be issued in two phases, each half.

The bond is specially authorized to be freely bought, sold, and mortgaged. The British gold bonds are divided into five denominations: 1,000 pounds, 100 pounds, 50 pounds, 10 pounds, and 5 pounds. The US dollar bonds are divided into six denominations: 5,000 dollars, 1,000 dollars, 100 dollars, 50 dollars, 10 dollars, and 5 dollars. All are bearer bonds.

### Valuation Committee Passes; Legal Profit for Foreign Rice; Calculated at 5% Above the Cost Price; Valuation of Domestic Rice is Difficult in Practice

The Rice Valuation Committee held a meeting of the full committee at its meeting place at 15 Edward Road at 4 p.m. yesterday. In addition to the 17 members of the committee, representatives from the Public Concession Bureau, the French Concession Directorate, and the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce were delegated to attend and provide guidance. Zhu Zixiang was elected as the temporary chairman. The chairman first reported, saying that last Wednesday, the members of the committee visited the Public Concession Bureau, where they were personally received by Deputy Director He, who instructed them to convene a meeting of the Valuation Committee immediately to assess and set new standard price limits for domestic and foreign rice, and promised that all replies would be sent to the committee and published in the newspapers that day.

Bureau's Concern

The meeting was originally scheduled to be held on time last Friday, but it was postponed due to the recent Double Tenth National Day. Deputy Director He expressed deep concern for the entire rice market in the city and was also aware of the difficulties faced by the committee in assessing the price, so he promised to provide all possible assistance. It was decided that Fu Qian-geng would report on the rice market trading situation, and He Quan-sheng would report on the domestic rice production volume and general rice transportation. Then the discussion began, and the situation became very tense. Each committee member made various suggestions, and the chairman then summarized the results: (1) The valuation of domestic rice is indeed difficult, because the production price is uncertain, transportation is not easy, and the source is scarcer than foreign rice. Therefore, a letter will be sent to the two concession authorities to explain the difficulties.

Principles Passed

(2) In accordance with the instructions of the two concession authorities, the standard price for buying and selling foreign rice will be assessed. First, the principles will be passed and submitted to the authorities for approval. After receiving a reply, they will be announced and implemented. The principles are as follows: "The daily trading price in the rice market will be announced in detail by the Valuation Committee or the Market Management Committee. All goods traded by the same industry in the market will be subject to a profit of 5% added to the cost price, for a period of three days." This was unanimously passed and will be submitted to the authorities for approval today.

Total Amount of Transactions

Rumors in the rice market say that the amount of foreign rice that has been telegraphed for transaction has reached more than 250,000 bags, which have been loaded onto ships and will arrive in Shanghai on the following dates: (1) The French postal ship "Yale", which departed on the 6th of this month, is expected to arrive in Shanghai on the 18th of this month, carrying 50,000 bags of rice; (2) The "Jones", which departed on the 12th, will arrive in Shanghai on the 22nd, carrying 50,000 bags of foreign rice; (3) The "Rosie", which departed on the 12th, will arrive in Shanghai on the 26th, carrying 30,000 bags of rice; (4) The "Dada Bird", which departed on the 16th, will arrive in Shanghai on the 28th, carrying 40,000 bags of rice (whether the ship will be able to arrive at that time, as it also plans to go to Xiaoluson Bay, is still a question). The rice industry has also received a telegram from Shenji Foreign Firm for the transaction of 1,500 tons of Saigon foreign rice (i.e., 15,000 bags), divided into grades 1 and 2. The actual transaction price is unknown. It is also reported that the Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association has decided to organize a group rice purchasing committee, with Lou Yanfang as chairman.

### French Tram Workers; Rioted in Western Shanghai Yesterday; Buses and Trolley Cars Diverted; No Resolution to French Labor Unrest

The English-language "Da Mei Wan Bao" reported that just after noon today (15th), about 350 Chinese people, including about 50 workers from the French Concession Tram Company, suddenly held a demonstration on Yu Yuan Road near the Jing'an Temple, and rushed onto trams and trolley cars of the Public Concession, shouting for others to join the French Concession Tram Company's

Deadlocked

It has been going on for three weeks. According to Mr. Fafeilei, manager of the company, this morning, there has been no new development in the negotiations for ending the labor unrest. Representatives of both labor and management are expected to continue talks today, but it is not possible to say when the labor unrest can be resolved soon. In addition, after the workers at the Pingliang Road factory of the Huamao Laundry Company went on strike last week, the company immediately hired new Chinese and Western employees to maintain operations. It is reported that several of the original skilled workers who went on strike have now returned to work, and the situation in the factory has returned to normal.

### British Tram Company; Mutual Benefit Agreement Between Labor and Management; Can Be Resolved in the Short Term

The tram labor unrest in the Public Concession, which lasted for more than a week, was completely resolved on the 29th of last month, but one important matter remains to be decided, namely the 22 articles of the "Mutual Benefit Agreement Between Labor and Management" proposed by the labor side. According to the agreement, the obligations and rights of labor and management are stipulated. When the labor side agreed to resume work, they requested the management side to reply within two weeks, but this deadline has now passed. According to labor sources yesterday, the management side has not yet given a satisfactory reply. However, labor and management will hold negotiations this week to discuss each article of the agreement in detail, and it can be resolved in the short term.

### Shanghai Branch of the Central Bank; Exchanges Damaged Fractional Currency; Must Make Up One Yuan; Stamped with Cancellation Mark

The Shanghai Branch of the Central Bank, in order to regulate the auxiliary currency in the Shanghai market, issued fractional currency notes of one and five cents with the approval of the Ministry of Finance, which have been widely circulated in the market.

Now the bank has decided to exchange them as much as possible, in accordance with the procedures for exchanging damaged banknotes, and the issuance department of the bank will be responsible for the exchange. However, for fractional currency notes of one and five cents, they must be made up to one yuan before they can be exchanged. Damaged banknotes exchanged will be stamped with the mark "This damaged banknote has been cancelled" on both sides. Regulations: (1) Damaged banknotes with a very small amount of damage and more than three-quarters of the remaining part; (2) Even if split, the pieces can still be joined together; (3) Damaged by dirt and smoke, but the signatures, serial numbers, text, and patterns are all identifiable; The above three items will be exchanged in full. However, all damaged banknotes with less than three-quarters of the remaining part will be exchanged at half the amount.

If there are special circumstances for damaged banknotes, and the person seeking exchange can prove the facts, and the competent authority believes that accommodation is possible, the exchange may be granted at its discretion. It is reported that the Central, China, Communications, and Farmers Banks will not distinguish between districts and will exchange damaged banknotes for each other.

### Plot to Murder for Money by Strangling His Own Brother; All Three Criminals Sentenced to Death; Guide Queen Wang Xiuzhen Acquitted

Chaozhou native Zhou Xiude, addicted to gambling and heavily in debt, with no way to make amends, hatched a sinister plan. On August 24th of this year, he colluded with Tongzhou native Tao Defeng, Haimen native Ni Baoqi, and Tao's lover, Queen Wang Xiuzhen, a guide from the Shantou Road Queen's Guide Agency, in room 528 of the Great China Hotel at 200 Yuqiaqing Road. They invited Zhou's own brother, Zhou Xiuzheng (general accountant at the Liyuan Customs Brokerage Firm at 19 Gongguan Road), and Wang used her beauty to persuade Zhou Xiuzheng to drink. As a result, Zhou Xiuzheng became drunk. Zhou Xiude, Tao Defeng, Ni Baoqi, etc., seeing that the time was ripe, used a rope to strangle Zhou Xiuzheng, obtaining the key to the silver box held by the deceased at Liyuan Firm.

Military Vehicle

New Asia Hotel on North Sichuan Road to bid farewell to their colleagues. When the car was traveling near the Donghe Hotel at the intersection of North Sichuan Road and Bazilu, suddenly there was a loud bang. On the glass window in front of driver Maitian's seat, there was a bullet mark with a diameter of one centimeter. Maitian was frightened by the shock and turned pale. The car stopped. Looking around at the pedestrians on the road, they were coming and going in confusion, with

No signs

To be found. So, he borrowed a nearby telephone and reported the situation to the Marine Corps Military Police. In a short time, a large group of Japanese soldiers and police arrived, immediately imposed strict security, blocked traffic, and began searching for the bold sniper. The state of tension at that time was no less than when Chuan Xiao'an was assassinated. All pedestrians, regardless of gender, were subject to inspection. This measure continued until late at night. As a result, nothing was gained. It is reported that the sniper in this battle only fired one shot, slightly injuring driver Maitian's left eye. The other three people were unharmed.

The Beijing Road 796 Lane 19, Liangyou Wireless Company suddenly received a call at 10:30 a.m. yesterday, claiming to be surnamed Lin, wanting to purchase three wireless radios and requesting that someone be sent to room 11, 3rd floor, 14 Lane 833, opposite the Cathay Grand Theatre on Xiafei Road. After receiving the call, the company sent apprentice Hu Huasheng to the address, carrying three radios worth more than 800 yuan. When he arrived at room 11, there were three men inside. They took the radios, but without asking any questions, they stuffed the apprentice's mouth with cotton, tied him to a chair, locked the door, and carried the three radios away. An hour later, the company received another call, claiming to be a neighbor from the 3rd floor, 14 Lane 833 on Xiafei Road, reporting that the wireless radio delivered by the company had been robbed and the apprentice had been tied up. The company immediately sent someone to investigate and found it to be true. They rescued the apprentice and reported to the Songshan Road Police Station.

It was not known that they would use it to carry out this scheme.

### Japanese Soldier's Belongings Stolen on Route 2 Bus

At approximately 2 p.m. the day before yesterday (Sunday), a Japanese officer and his orderly boarded a Route 2 bus in western Shanghai heading east. When the bus passed Jing'an Temple Road, the Japanese officer discovered that his diary, handbook, etc., which he was carrying with him, had been pickpocketed. Because the diary and handbook contained important orders and documents, he immediately looked anxious and instructed his orderly to order the driver to stop the bus. However, because the bus was stopped in the middle of the road, the two of them were unable to search. So, they ordered the ticket seller to prevent passengers from getting off the bus and ordered the driver to drive the bus directly to the Jing'an Temple Police Station, where police officers would conduct a search. The police officers were surprised to see the Route 2 bus, full of fifty or sixty male and female passengers, driving straight in, and were unclear about the situation. After the Japanese officer reported the reason, the police officers strictly searched all the passengers, the driver, and the ticket seller, but found nothing. They ordered the bus to drive away.

### General Manager of Hexing Tobacco Company, Yao Weixiong, Kidnapped Yesterday; Bandits Lay in Wait at the Alley Entrance, Abducting Him Without a Trace; The Tobacco Factory Was Destroyed by Artillery Fire, Resulting in Significant Losses

Yesterday, a kidnapping case occurred on Avenue Haig; the kidnapped individual was Yao Weixiong, the manager of Hexing Tobacco Company. The detailed circumstances of the case are recorded and reported as follows:

Shangsheng Automobile Hijacked by Bandits

Yesterday at 10:40 AM, a Western-dressed passenger suddenly arrived at the Jiaozhou Road branch of the Shangsheng Automobile Company in this city and hired a car. The station dispatched car number 18562, driven by driver Shen Axing (a 39-year-old from Ningbo). The passenger told Shen to stop briefly when the car reached the intersection of Avenue Haig and Jiaozhou Road. The passenger then got out of the car and left. Soon after, four men, along with a man around fifty years old, got into the car. Shen caught a glimpse of the four men all holding handguns, so he dared not speak out. However, he realized the case was a kidnapping. After the four bandits got into the car, they instructed Shen to drive to the vicinity of the Caojiadu Wujiaochang area, where they forced Shen out of the car. One of the bandits drove away, and they disappeared instantly.

Tobacco Company Manager Abducted

After watching the car drive away, Shen went to the Jing'an Temple Police Station to report the incident. At that time, the police station in charge had already received a report from Ren Deheng (36 years old, from Zhenjiang), the chauffeur of Yao Weixiong, a local resident of Jialu residence number 21, Lane 1592, Avenue Haig. According to Ren, his master, Yao Weixiong, is the general manager of Hexing Tobacco Company at numbers 781 Niuzhuang Road and 277 Ningbo Road. He uses car number 5522 as his means of transportation. Yesterday morning at 10:50 AM, Yao seemed to be going to the company to work. As soon as he left the house and stepped into the car, four bandits suddenly appeared, each holding a handgun. Two bandits were in front, monitoring him, and two bandits were behind, holding the master hostage.

Bandits Open Fire; People and Car Vanish

However, the car was a new model, and the bandit in front did not know how to drive it, so it could not start. The bandit then questioned Ren, who answered evasively. Two of the bandits became furious and fired a shot at him, but fortunately, he was not hit. Because the car could not move, the four bandits took their master and jumped into Shangsheng's taxi number 18562, which was parked on the side of the road, and sped away. The police station believed the two cases were related and ordered a thorough investigation to apprehend the criminals. As of late evening, there was still no news of the hijacked Shangsheng automobile being found.

Outwardly Strong, Inwardly Weak, Merely Maintaining the Status Quo

It was later learned that the Hexing Company's factory was originally located on Yuezhou Road in Hongkou, but all the buildings and assets were destroyed in the war. Currently, they are temporarily renting Jingxingli on Ningbo Road as a temporary factory, operating on a small scale to maintain the livelihood of the general staff. Yao's assets were all destroyed in the "August 13th" artillery fire. Recently, business has been sluggish, resulting in heavy losses. They are currently organizing a syndicate to maintain the company's current status, which is actually outwardly strong but inwardly weak.

### Gold Prices Fluctuated Throughout the Day at 115 Yuan, Down 13 Yuan from the Previous Day

The unofficial market for cash gold was still good yesterday, but it closed slightly lower. Fluctuations closely followed the exchange rate market, so it once reached 5,740 yuan. Later, rumors of news in the Pacific spread, the short side greatly increased momentum, and prices fell. However, the potential was still stable, so they bought in when it was low, and profited by covering shorts. As a result, it closed at 5,645 yuan, down 13 yuan from the previous day. Trading was still brisk with more than 3,000 taels traded. Gold jewelry stores ultimately remained flat, and Guan Yu and others were also flat.

Cash Closed Lower

In the morning, the exchange rate market reported tightening, and people's hearts were upward. The opening price was quite high, with silver shops first entering gold shops for 20 taels at 5,700 yuan. However, after opening, it was flat and tired, and buyers did not step forward. Silver shops exited gold shops for 20 taels at 5,660 yuan. Then, money changers entered gold shops for 30 taels, returning to 5,680 yuan. Ultimately, silver shops and money changers sold forcefully, and securities firms entered the market to sell short, making prices more unsustainable. Silver shops exited securities firms for 10 taels, falling to 5,650 yuan. Subsequently, as the foreign exchange rate softened at this time, silver shops and money changers covered shorts and absorbed, and gold shops bought vigorously, causing prices to rise to 700 yuan outside the customs, with the highest silver shop entering money changers for 20 taels at 5,740 yuan. But near noon, because rumors of some negative news in the Pacific spread, the foreign exchange rate had already seen a return to long positions, and securities firms and silver shops tended to sell, causing prices to decline. Securities firms resold to silver shops for 20 taels at 5,670 yuan, and silver shops entered gold shops for 10 taels at 5,680 yuan, making the noon closing price. In the afternoon, the situation was sluggish. The opening price was 20 taels between silver shops for 5,650 yuan, and gold shops sold 10 taels to silver shops for 5,660 yuan. However, silver shops, securities firms, etc. set off a selling trend, causing prices to decline further. Gold shops exited silver shops for 20 taels at 5,625 yuan. Fortunately, before long, securities firms suddenly reversed and bought in, and gold shops also took advantage of the low price to buy, so prices were able to return. Money changers entered silver shops for 10 taels, reporting 5,665 yuan. At closing, because money changers unloaded, silver shops exited money changers for 20 taels at 5,645 yuan, making the evening closing price, down 13 yuan from the previous day, with a fluctuation of 115 yuan throughout the day. The selling price of cash gold at gold shops was more than ten yuan higher than the cash closing price, and the purchase price was reduced by more than thirty yuan.

### Grain: All Rice Declines, Except Sticky Rice Which Surges

After a brief rebound at noon, the Yang rice market showed a lack of confidence at the opening yesterday. Many speculative holders rushed to sell, while merchants and retailers remained cautious and did not enter the market. The situation gradually softened, and prices initially fell by half a yuan before showing some activity. Near noon, selling pressure increased, and prices fell another half yuan. At the close, prices were nearly one yuan lower than the previous session. No. 2 Saigon fell from 55.5 yuan to 55 yuan, No. 2 Siam from 63.5 yuan to 63 yuan, Xiaojiao rice to 63 yuan, and Wuhu Kejian rice to 61.5 yuan. This was because new orders continued to be finalized, and in addition to the arrival of bulk shipments, smaller batches from the ports of Guangxi and Myanmar were also continuously arriving. In the afternoon, selling exceeded buying, and the market further declined by two to three jiao. New transactions included Shen Ji continuing to handle 1,000 tons of No. 1 Saigon at 79.8 yuan and 500 tons of No. 2 Saigon at 76 yuan. Repackaged No. 2 Siam was offered at 75.8 yuan, totaling 50 tons. The trading volume of current rice was 7,000 bags.

The arrival of new Jingjian rice, Yaozhong Baige rice, etc., has been abundant in recent days, with another four to five thousand dan arriving yesterday. Due to sluggish sales, holders feared weakness and adopted a policy of selling off their holdings. Consequently, prices of these varieties plummeted by more than two yuan. New Jing rice fell from 77-78 yuan to 75 yuan, Yaozhong rice to 76.5 yuan, Baige rice to 75 yuan, and Dujian rice fell sharply from 68 yuan to 66 yuan, while repackaged rice was at 70 yuan, and Yangjian rice fell sharply from 67 yuan to 65 yuan.

Due to the scarcity of sticky rice on the market, it attracted the attention of large players who started actively accumulating it. As a result, both domestic and foreign sticky rice became the target, and fluctuations were unusually large, with prices surging by two to three yuan. Liyang Zhenzhen sticky rice opened at 76 yuan, Jintan Te yuan sticky rice at 75.5 yuan, 75 yuan, and Changdan sticky rice also required 73-74 yuan. Hong Kong special sticky rice fell sharply from 73.5 yuan to 70 yuan in Zhongguan, and sticky tea rice fell sharply from 66 yuan to 64-65 yuan, etc.

The arrival of foreign rice in Shanghai has been vigorous.

In addition, the Risheng wheel arrived in Shanghai the night before last, carrying 707 bags from Hong Kong, which docked at the Roosevelt Wharf and began unloading yesterday. (Zu)

### Flour Remains Expensive

The flour market remains brisk. Since the production of various factories has decreased, and the supply of flour from the mainland, Japanese factories, and foreign sources is scarce, the availability of current flour has become increasingly tight. Repackaged Lao Che flour is quoted at over 19 yuan, but actual transactions are still within the 19 yuan range, and the volume is only two to three hundred bags. As for foreign flour, the inventory is running out, and although there are large orders, they cannot arrive in time to replenish the supply. Therefore, sellers are taking advantage of the situation to raise prices. High-grade foreign flour such as Fushou brand is approaching the 20 yuan mark, with retail prices at 19.8 yuan per bag. Prices of flour from Chinese factories, both wholesale and for bulk purchases, have remained largely unchanged. The total quantity sold by the two factories is estimated to be over 7,000 bags.

Wheat prices have been quite firm in recent days. Due to disruptions in train transportation and a lack of supply, it has become even more difficult to transport wheat into the concessions. Therefore, it is rumored that Zhongguan wheat is being offered at 27 yuan, but there is no bulk supply. As for Japanese factories, the purchase price is still around 21 yuan, and only three to five hundred bags are being delivered to the factories.

### Securities

Internal Debt Fluctuates: Yesterday, the securities market continued to fluctuate without significant gains or losses. Various groups were observing and awaiting changes. Currently, rumors are rampant, and there is no certainty regarding positive or negative factors. Significant changes are expected in a week. Yesterday morning, trading was relatively active. Dakangcheng No. 16 had considerable buying volume, while Hongda Tong咽 supplied a significant amount. Ru鼎 Kang and Runli successively absorbed at lower prices. On the other hand, Hengfu Datong also supplied, causing slight fluctuations in market prices, but ultimately there was no significant difference. Trading was extremely quiet in the afternoon, with only Runli and Changkang showing some buying interest, and Jiufeng showing considerable selling interest. As a result, market prices remained high and low within a range of about one jiao. The transaction volume was only around 500,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below.

Stock transactions: 100 shares of Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company were traded at a price of 15.25 yuan per share.

There are many rumors in the foreign stock market, and prices fluctuate. The underlying momentum remains very good. Whenever profit-takers emerge, buyers bravely absorb, and the closing prices are extraordinarily firm. Jardine Matheson stocks had the largest trading volume. Dutch East Indies Rubber, Jardine Matheson, and English & Chinese Corporation were also very popular.

London, 14th (Monday): Today's listed prices for Chinese foreign debt and Far East British companies' stocks saw a slight decline in bank stocks. HSBC Bank's London-registered shares continued to fall by half a pound, priced at 57 pounds. Hong Kong-registered shares remained unchanged, still at 70 pounds. Mercantile Bank shares fell by 7 shillings and 6 pence, priced at 10 pounds, 7 shillings and 6 pence. The rest remained unchanged.

### Yarn & Cotton: Varied Rumors Plague the Yarn Futures Market, Fluctuations Increase Daily, and Price Swings Become More Frequent

The yarn market experiences large ups and downs, changing several times a day, and is plagued by numerous and varied rumors, leaving people in a fog. In reality, this is entirely due to manipulation by speculators. The range of fluctuations is expanding daily, and the increased volume of chips in the market makes both bulls and bears uneasy. Sales by Hong Kong firms are slower than before, but in general, speculators sell when prices rise and buy when prices fall, resulting in a market that rises rapidly and retreats quickly.

At the opening of the current yarn market this morning, the bulls had already been active the previous day, taking advantage of the momentum to push prices higher. The opening price of 20-count Double Horse yarn was 1,255 yuan, soon rising to 1,265 yuan. This peak, a jump of 100 yuan in two days, triggered profit-taking. At the same time, Tianjin firms sold off in bulk, causing the market to turn sharply downwards, falling to 1,232 yuan. When this low price appeared, the bulls returned to push prices up again, rising to 1,261 yuan. However, due to weak sales to customers, the closing price on a certain exchange suddenly fell by 40-50 yuan. After closing strong, prices fell to 1,242 yuan. The total transaction volume for half a day was 5,250 bales, with the price of 20-count Double Horse yarn rising by 20 yuan. The volume of purchases by various firms is listed below: Same Trade: 4,760; Hong Kong: 490; Total: 5,250.

Today, 45 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Xiamen, and 375 pieces were shipped to Xianggang.

### Foreign Cotton Prices Rise Seemingly Without End

The current cotton situation remains firm, but transactions have not fully developed. Manufacturers have reduced their labor force, resulting in lower demand, so while holders are extremely bullish, consumers are less enthusiastic. It is also difficult to predict the changes that will occur after the current ban on the export of new cotton from the mainland is lifted.

In the foreign cotton market, the New York cotton market was quiet. Due to slight selling by spot traders and the liquidation of some long positions, the closing prices were 5-6 pound sounds lower than today. Initial estimates for India were a drop of more than two rupees.

The trading of foreign cotton in Shanghai has been very active recently. However, due to the limited inventory in the market, there have not been large transactions. Demand from factories has increased, causing cotton prices to rise even higher, seemingly without end. There is panic among industry players about ordering Indian cotton and Brazilian Indian cotton to replenish the supply of raw cotton in Shanghai.

### Oil Market: Edible Oil Floating Stocks Rush to Sell

Yesterday's edible oil market saw a halt in the issuance of permits for transport to the mainland by the Japanese side. As a result, the inventory of raw oil in the market appeared thick, and people became nervous, with floating stocks rushing to sell. Futures first fell sharply. Raw oil was only offered in 20 barrels of Qingdao barrel raw oil at a price of 108.8 yuan. Futures fell by two to three yuan. The current trend is entirely one of oversupply. However, under the control of a strong long position, the price decline has not been particularly violent. There was little buying and selling of soybean oil, and the market price was dragged down by raw oil by five jiao to one yuan. 50 pieces of Jiaozhou soybean oil were traded, and the price details are listed in the market price column. 50 pieces of Yanqi soybean oil and 200 dan of Dayou factory soybean oil were traded. In futures, over 400 pieces of Jiaozhou oil for October delivery were traded, with the price falling from 79.5 yuan to 77.75 yuan. 50 barrels of Qingdao oil for October delivery were traded at 108 yuan, and 600-700 barrels for November delivery fell sharply from 111.5 yuan to 108.5 yuan. Today, 525 bags of soybeans were shipped to Xiamen, and 400 bags were shipped to Singapore. In addition, 1,860 pieces of soybean cake were also shipped to Singapore. Furthermore, 100 pieces of tung oil were shipped to Hong Kong, and 30 pieces were shipped to Yantai.

### Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth Remains Firm

Domestic Cloth

Yesterday, the cloth market saw a large rise followed by a small retracement. Due to rising盘 prices, merchants and hoarding households followed the trend and bought in, resulting in quite brisk transactions. Selling prices continued to rise by 2.5 jiao to 1 yuan per piece. However, in the afternoon, industry players took profits, causing the market to become quite chaotic, with some retracement, falling by 2.5 jiao to 5 jiao per piece. As a result, prices were still higher than the previous day. This street saw 800 pieces of grey cloth, coarse cloth, colored cloth, flannel, etc. The Zhejiang Route Wenzhou-Taizhou firms continued to purchase over 300 pieces of fine cloth, coarse cloth, and colored cloth. The Guangdong-Hong Kong firms purchased over 100 pieces of colored cloth, colored twill, etc. The Northern Route Yantai-Tianjin firms purchased over 200 pieces of flannel, coarse cloth, and colored cloth.

Eastern Cloth

The market momentum remains firm. High-grade fine cloth opened at 38.5 yuan, but retraced due to falling yarn prices. However, it rose again in the afternoon, closing at 38.05 yuan. Mid-grade fine cloth and fine twill remained firm due to continued good sales. The closing price of Four Gentlemen Serge was 1.1575 yuan per yard.

Piece Goods

Today, 73 pieces were shipped to Yantai, 181 pieces were shipped to Xiamen, 630 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong, and 115 pieces were shipped to Singapore.

### Silk and Tea  Silk Prices Are Good, But What Good Is It If the Supply Is Controlled?  There Is Renewed Hope for the Tea Market

Regarding silk, yesterday the price of American silk rose sharply. Yokohama spot prices opened at 1,500 yuan, rising by 40 yuan, sweeping away the dull atmosphere of the past three months. However, forward prices only rose by one yuan, indicating that the future of the silk market is not necessarily optimistic. New York spot prices were unavailable. Exchange prices rose by 8.5 fen for the near term and 4.5 fen for the far term. Actual sales have not been brisk, which is due to speculative trading.

The local silk market was also active yesterday. White filature 78 fen to 81 fen saw transactions. Jardine Matheson offered the best price at 5,350 yuan; others were at 5,250-5,300 yuan. The total transaction volume from all parties is estimated to be over 100 bales. The dull silk market has indeed suddenly changed color. It is a pity that the supply is controlled by others, preventing us from taking the opportunity to expand sales.

Since the cutoff of tea sales to France, according to recent surveys, the port city has the following Chinese tea in stock: 75,000 boxes of Luchow green tea, 50,000 boxes of Pingshui green tea, 12,000 boxes of Hubei and Hunan black tea, 10,000 boxes of Fujian black tea, and 7,000 boxes of Keemun black tea, totaling over 150,000 boxes. It is also rumored that after the opening of the Yunnan-Burma Road, the Hong Kong government will fully lift the ban on tea exports, and foreign merchants will be free to purchase. There is considerable hope for the revival of tea sales thereafter.

Today, 28 pieces of tea leaves are being shipped to Xiamen, and 65 pieces are being shipped to Singapore.

### Itinerant Children's Groups

— Bai Xi

Childhood is the time when curiosity is at its peak and the desire for knowledge is most developed; children often have countless questions about the things they encounter in their daily lives, and they also hope to have these questions answered satisfactorily, so that they can understand the essence of everything. Because of this, they cannot be satisfied with the knowledge they gain from textbooks at school and begin to seek enrichment outside of textbooks.

When they grope like blind people on the edge of the sea of knowledge, they are most likely to encounter "picture story books" that exploit children's curiosity to spread poison. They spend their golden years in the supernatural atmosphere of "a white light and a head falling to the ground" and on obscene pictures that are unfit for consumption, staining their pure and flawless childhood. In addition, they will also encounter books that are only suitable for adults to read. These books not only fail to provide them with spiritual nourishment but, on the contrary, cast indelible shadows on their minds.

How to provide good extracurricular reading materials to enrich children's leisure life should be a question that every teacher and parent should pay attention to. However, in the current environment, the purchase of textbooks has already increased the burden on parents a lot. There are not many families that have the surplus capacity to purchase complete extracurricular reading materials, and schools are also limited by economic strength. Teachers can only circle around the thin textbooks and rarely purchase reference books.

Recently, the children's group organized by eleven groups, including the China Philanthropic Children's Association, the Public Works Department, and the Shanghai Children's Protection Association, has begun active preparations. On the one hand, we hope that powerful people in the society will generously sponsor it so that this meaningful plan can be realized as soon as possible; on the other hand, we are also willing to contribute some humble opinions for advanced people to adopt.

Adapting to the requirements of the current objective environment, we hope that the organizing committee of the children's group will decide to put forward a part of the soft items and first organize a large-scale itinerant mobile group. Select various children's reading materials and supplementary teaching materials for elementary school subjects, arrange them in three or four groups according to level, and prepare multiple copies of each group. Use sturdy, lightweight, and space-saving bookshelves to install them and supply them to children in various schools for reading in turn. Tour once every week or two weeks. At the same time, we also hope to provide reading materials for the lower grades to children who are generally unable to attend school on the streets and make full use of pictures and give more explanations.

The ideal itinerant children's group should not only have good reading materials reviewed by educational experts, but more importantly, it should also have various specimens and books that match natural science teaching materials, as well as photographic charts and real objects that match social science, so that the knowledge gained by children inside and outside the classroom can inspire each other to increase interest in reading and supplement the deficiencies in the equipment of various schools. It is best to have a small magic lantern to tour and show in various schools, instilling knowledge of agriculture, industry, hygiene, nature, etc. into their minds in a way that can best arouse children's interest. In addition, some entertainment equipment such as chess pieces and table tennis can be attached so that children can get more life adjustment in addition to reading.

Before the establishment of a well-equipped and large-scale children's group, this itinerant mobile library method may be able to make a considerable contribution to the supply of children's spiritual food.

Hawthorne's Detective Work

### The Ballerina's End

— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter 9 Startling News

I felt a little abrupt again and asked, "What does this mean?"

Hawthorne had already moved his steps towards the door, and replied as he walked, "You don't have to ask this for now, I don't have time to explain." He had already quickly walked down the steps.

I also followed him out, "Hey, Hawthorne, what should I talk to Li Zifan about? Can we tell him about the things we've been through?"

Hawthorne walked out of the gate and was already starting to open his car door. He replied simply, "You can ask him about his son Shouqi's matter." He had already jumped into the car, and in an instant, the car had driven away with a crunch.

I returned to Hawthorne's office, feeling an indescribable annoyance in my heart—the suspense of the case, the information that was beyond my expectation, and Hawthorne's aimless task entrusted to me, were all the causes of this annoyance. It was exactly 2:35 at this time. Hawthorne told me to go to the Wang's house again in half an hour, so I had to find a way to kill these difficult twenty-five minutes. I sat on the sofa, lit a cigarette, and silently pondered the case, hoping to find an answer if possible. Hawthorne repeatedly said that the inside story of the case was complicated. Looking at it now, there is really no doubt about it. Looking at the gradual development of this case, it must be said that the investigation circle has gradually narrowed. The first suspect was of course Yu Gantang. According to Yu Gantang's own confession, if it is not fabricated, it is clear that he is not the main culprit. From my observation, his voice, appearance, and attitude, his words do not seem to be out of fabrication. Then, he should be removed from the suspect circle. But why does Hawthorne still want to detain him? The second suspect, Lu Jiansheng, Hawthorne also believes that he would not have beaten Wang Lilan to death. But the fact that his leather shoes match the nail prints in the murder house is still an unsolved mystery. The third suspect, Zhao Boxiong, is of course the most suspicious. There is already various concrete evidence of his actions. Let alone anything else, but look at the bullet that pierced Wang Lilan's chest, and the bullet that hit Hawthorne in the Yadong Hotel, are all obvious ironclad evidence. Originally, we could have narrowed the suspect circle down to him alone, and then one step further, we could have announced the end. But now the situation has changed again. He has been released by Director Cui! Moreover, it was revealed that Wang Lilan's death was not caused by a gunshot wound but by a knife wound! Then, Director Cui released him based on this reason? However, this move is ultimately illegal and unreasonable. Even if he is not the murderer, he clearly has committed the act of homicide, and he has also beaten Hawthorne. In terms of law, no matter what, he will always have the crime he deserves. How can he release this person without authorization? (137)

### A Public Notice Regarding the Prevailing Epidemic

— Zhang Juying

Since the beginning of autumn this year, a type of feverish illness has been prevalent. It begins with feeling cold and shivering, followed by alternating high and low temperatures, peaking at 40 degrees Celsius. Headaches are more severe in the back of the head, or with soreness around the eyes, aches in the joints and muscles, dark urine, and constipation in the early stages. People feel depressed and listless, lose their appetite, and in severe cases, may experience delirium at night and be unable to sleep soundly. The face becomes flushed or develops rash-like spots, followed by more extensive rashes. The pulse is initially rapid, then slows down. According to our country’s old medical books, there is no suitable name for this disease. Consequently, when people seek treatment from doctors, they are often treated blindly. Mild cases are treated with perfunctory prescriptions, while severe cases are subjected to excessive purging, leading to distorted disease patterns and worsening conditions.

I encounter many cases of this disease every day and have been unable to diagnose it. I have been using medications based on the principles of the *Shang Han Lun*, inducing sweating when there is no sweat, relieving muscles when there is sweat, resolving dampness, clearing heat, promoting digestion, and encouraging urination, each based on the observed symptoms. Patients usually recover in six or seven days, so I assumed it was a common infectious disease and did not pay much attention. Recently, I have seen an increasing number of mistreated cases, so I began to pay closer attention to researching what this disease is called. I can no longer continue treating it without a proper diagnosis. Unable to find relevant information in old books and formularies, I consulted Western medical texts and found a disease with similar symptoms, a type of infectious disease called "Dengue Fever." The origin of the name "Dengue" is unknown, likely a personal name (as many diseases in Western medicine are named after the person who discovered them). This disease is rarely fatal. It has also been prevalent in Shantou and Chaozhou in our country, where it is called "Peaceful Disease" or "Wishful Disease," because it is generally not fatal. However, when treated by incompetent doctors, the "Peaceful Disease" becomes not so peaceful, and the "Wishful Disease" turns out not so wishful.

### No Western Suits, No Perms

— Guo Jiyao

Recently, our school issued a notice: "Starting next week, male students are not allowed to wear Western suits, and female students are not allowed to perm their hair." This is not a meaningless matter! I hope more schools will implement this rule.

### Cold-Hearted Mockery

— Gu Shengyu

Every day, when I open the newspaper, the first things I see, besides the large news headlines, are large advertisements. Among these many advertisements, the most common are pharmaceutical advertisements; and among the pharmaceutical advertisements, the most common are tonic advertisements.

Who doesn't wish to improve their health? Large advertisements, vivid illustrations, captivating words, exaggerating excellent features and miraculous effects – all of these touch everyone's heart, making them yearn for a healthy path.

Flipping through the pages of a newspaper, one page reports on commercial news, with the word "increase" alarming everyone. Some figures report boundless prices. The most alarming is the word "rice" – this ever-increasing price often reminds people of the past: the past compared to now, now it has increased tenfold. Some may rejoice at this news, but how many are worried! People's hearts are burdened with a heavy weight.

One part of the newspaper has large advertisements urging people to take tonics and improve their health; yet another part hides an alarming problem – the problem of livelihood. People are confined to the simplest circle of life, so how can they have the leisure to consider extra tonics?

This is truly a cruel and cold-hearted mockery.

### Five Days of Theatergoing

— Xuchu

9th: Watched La Fei's "The Great Ming Heroes." The structure is tight, and the plot is moving. Xia Xia plays Su Jiao, holding a candlestick as she walks up the lighthouse steps, calling out with each step. The lamplight flickers, and the sound of the waves outside the window is immense. It's a beautiful scene. I think this scene could be photographed. I heard that the way the flower drum is played took some consideration. In the past, "Heaven, Earth, Man" published a flower drum illustration from the Ming Dynasty collected by Li Jiarui, but unfortunately, I can't find this publication; otherwise, it could be provided as a reference for them.

10th: Attended the Pingsheng Opera Society gathering. First time hearing Zhang Yingge and his talented student Lu Panfangren sing "The Peony Pavilion." Yingge has a long black beard and looks very much like Feng Zikai. His singing is extremely soft and melodious. Later, he and the white-bearded Lu Aitang sang "The Interrupted Dream." The white-bearded Zhang Junrui and the black-bearded Yingying were a delightful contrast. All three sang well, and applause erupted after their performance.

11th: In the morning, I missed the test screening of "Families of the Qinhuai River" due to an engagement. My niece went to see it and said, "It's very good-looking!" "Seeing so many movie stars, Zhou Xuan, Murong Wan'er, it was really worth it!" In the evening, I went with Xitong and others to see Xuan Palace's "Sea Country Hero." Xitong said, "Gu Lanjun looks very beautiful! With rouge, she looks really good! The casual conversation is also very well done!" I said, "I had only seen Qian Yi acting before. Now his younger brother, Xiao Hai, can also act! He's only about ten years old, right? He plays Zheng Jing with great maturity and cuteness! His spirit when drawing his sword and his stance when standing are so good! Chen Qi's song, accompanied by music, is also very pleasant to listen to."

12th: In the evening, braved the rain to see Jin Cheng and Li Qinian's movie "Liang Hongyu." The naval battle scene was very realistic. The entire play is mostly based on Zhang Siwei's Ming Dynasty play "Biography of Two Martyrs". The initial encounter with Fang La, the pacification of Miao Liu, and the final impeachment of her husband by Hongyu were all included.

13th: At 9:00 AM, watched the Big Bell Theatre Company perform Gorky's three one-act plays, performed by Vera, Zhou Qi, Tianran, Lushan, and others. There was also a speech by Xu Xingzhi, calmly discussing Gorky's life, Fang Xin reading Gorky's letter to Sun Yat-sen, Zhu Weiji and others reciting "The Song of the Petrel" and poems commemorating Gorky, and Chen Gexin leading the singing of Gorky's poems. This was truly a grand commemoration of the 48th anniversary of Gorky's creative work.

### Island Theater Talk

— Weiwei

Kun actress Xin Yanqiu, responding to Huang Jin's invitation, came with young male actor Yu Zhenfei, beared male actor Zhou Xiaotian, martial actor Ru Fulan, and others. They arrived in Shanghai on the 12th. Now, I will briefly discuss the art of Yanqiu and Zhenfei.

Discussing the contemporary Kun actresses, after Xue Yanqin, Xin Yanqiu Zhang Eyun should be considered the best among them. Eyun and Yanqiu are of the same lineage as Yu Shuang. Although their singing and recitation each have their own merits, Yanqiu surpasses Eyun in skill, bearing, and appearance. Since Yanqiu's art has surpassed Eyun, she is undoubtedly one of the best Kun female actors today, and cannot be compared with ordinary upstarts.

As for Zhenfei, although he was born in Jiangnan, he already occupies the most prominent position among the young male actors in the north. Why is this? True gold fears no fire. According to the young male actors in the north, after De Junru and Zhu Suyun, Cheng Jixian was hailed as a rare gleam of light. But Jixian is already in his sixties. How can a sixty-year-old man play a young male actor? Even if he has superb skills, can he be truly fitting? He cannot compare with younger generations. Among the younger generation, there are two who follow the style of Jixian: one is Ye Shenglan, and the other is Zhenfei. Shenglan is the young master of Fuliangen. He believes that the rapid-fire teaching method of Fuliangen is superior to everything else. Therefore, Shenglan often does not follow everything taught by Jixian, preferring to abandon Jixian's strengths and take on Fuliangen's shortcomings. This is Shenglan's mistake. Zhenfei is different. Since following Jixian, he has treated Jixian with great respect as a disciple. Zhenfei has followed everything taught by Jixian. Therefore, among today's young male actor performances, Zhenfei is the only one who has captured Jixian's overall style and embodies Jixian's essence. In addition, Zhenfei has a long-standing reputation for his studies in Kunqu opera. Not only is his stage presence and demeanor outstanding, but his strengths may even surpass those of Jixian. Therefore, in terms of today's young male actors, Zhenfei is truly outstanding.

### Ying Yin Stars in "Sai Jinhua"

Ying Yin, who is to star in the film "Sai Jinhua," has gathered all relevant works about Sai Jinhua, such as Zeng Mengpu's "Flower in a Sinful Sea," Liu Bannong's "The True Story of Sai Jinhua," and Xia Yan and Xiong Foxi's script of "Sai Jinhua," as research material. According to Ying Yin's words to reporters, the role of Sai Jinhua fits her personality quite well, and she believes she can be confident in her performance. Director Zhu Shilin also takes this film very seriously, believing that it has been almost a year since the public invited Ying Yin to Shanghai, and today is the first time that they have started to formally work together. Its importance can be seen, and therefore, he will also go all out to accomplish the task.

### "Young Edison" to be Shown Soon

— Moli

"Young Edison," starring Mickey Rooney, is a major film worth recommending this year. It portrays several stories from the childhood of the great inventor Thomas Edison very vividly. This is Mickey's first film after being selected as the "Emperor of Cinema" for 1940. It is worth noting that the childhood of the great inventor is played by the child superstar of the Silver Screen.

Thomas Edison faced setbacks everywhere in his childhood, was ridiculed by people, and even his father considered him to be a good-for-nothing idiot. But he ignored everything, determined to work hard, and eventually became a great man. This is very similar to the childhood of the great sages and heroes of our country in ancient times. So, from the perspective of consciousness, this is a movie worth watching.

"Young Edison" and "Edison the Man" are two sister films that have a connection with each other. "Edison the Man" stars the great star Spencer Tracy and will soon be shipped over. Fans who are captivated by Spencer's acting and eager to see "Edison the Man" must see "Young Edison" first.

### Song Ya Hani's Wedding

— Qinghui

Although foreign newspapers have published news about the marriage of Song Ya Hani and Tan Tuoping, they were brief and not detailed. In order to provide a detailed account, I have consulted various magazines and compiled the following information for the readers, so that they may feel as if they were personally there and participated in their wedding.

Wedding Ceremony

Their wedding date was on the afternoon of July 4th, in Chicago. It wasn't in some grand hotel or auditorium, but simply borrowed the reception room of Song Ya's manager's private residence. The wedding ceremony was very simple. They invited a Norwegian pastor who read a passage from the Bible, and the ceremony was considered complete. There were very few people present to witness the ceremony. Besides Song Ya's mother, brother, and sister-in-law, and Tan Tuoping's business manager Han Kailai, there were practically no outsiders.

Bridal Gown

On that day, the wedding dress Song Ya wore was extremely unique. Everything followed Norwegian customs and habits, so it was completely different from ordinary wedding dresses. She wore a black robe, and on the middle finger of her left hand, she wore a large diamond wedding ring. She wore a slight smile on her face, looking just like a newlywed bride who had achieved a complete and satisfying result.

Groom's Silhouette

Now let's talk about the groom, Tan Tuoping. He is a wealthy young man from New York, tall and handsome, with the reputation of being a "handsome young gentleman." He is also quite well-known in social circles. The Brooklyn Building, one of the prominent buildings in the United States, is owned by him. He was previously married to another woman named Arlene George, but they eventually divorced due to disagreements. The divorce procedures were not fully completed until this spring, otherwise his marriage to Song Ya would not have been so swift!

Career Prospects

Regarding Song Ya Hani's career prospects, and whether she will retire from the film industry after marriage, is also a matter of great concern to movie fans. In order to clarify this point, someone recently inquired about her own opinion. Song Ya Hani's response was this: "Many people think that I will retire from the film industry after marrying Tan Tuoping, but this is absolutely not true. Maybe I will have this intention in the future, but I definitely won't in the near future. Moreover, my work in all aspects is going very smoothly at the moment, so there is no need to be passive."
