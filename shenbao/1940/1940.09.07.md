### Report of Military Agreement Signed: Vietnamese Authorities Permit Japanese Troops to Pass Through; British Foreign Secretary Expresses Extreme Concern Over the Situation in Vietnam; Four Japanese Ministers Hold Meeting to Discuss New Southern Advance Policy

Manila: According to authoritative sources arriving here from Hanoi, an agreement has been signed between the Japanese military delegation and the French authorities in Hanoi, permitting the Japanese to transport troops through Vietnam. However, foreign reports that Japanese troops have already begun landing in Vietnam have not been officially confirmed. Hanoi has not yet reported on the Japanese landing. However, well-informed sources say that even if the Japanese have indeed landed, direct reports from Hanoi may not be available because all major locations in the French colony have inspection agencies. According to Hanoi sources, Vietnam has implemented military alert measures. Although official Hanoi telegrams have stated that a diplomatic agreement in principle, acknowledging certain Japanese demands, has been established between the French and Japanese governments in Tokyo and Vichy, the methods for implementing the agreement are still under discussion in Hanoi.

Chongqing: According to official sources here, the Vietnamese authorities have permitted 12,000 Japanese troops to land at three locations. (Reuters report, 6th)

Chongqing: Although reports from Saigon say that the Japanese have withdrawn their ultimatum, Chinese observers continue to monitor the situation in Vietnam. According to Chinese sources, French and Japanese representatives have reached a preliminary agreement in Vichy regarding the granting of certain military facilities in Vietnam to the Japanese. According to Chinese military authorities, the Japanese are now preparing to cross Guibian (桂邊) and enter Yunnan Province via Lansen (蘭森, transliteration) and Tongdeng (同登) near Zhennanguan (鎮南關). At the same time, Chinese observers are closely watching the attitudes of Britain and the United States should the Japanese invade Vietnam. This morning, all Chinese newspapers here prominently featured U.S. Secretary of State Hull's statement regarding the situation in Vietnam. (Reuters report, 6th)

Tokyo: "Kokumin Shimbun" reports that the Japanese Prime Minister, Foreign Minister, Army Minister, and Navy Minister have decided to adopt a strong policy regarding Vietnam, regardless of any foreign statements. "Asahi Shimbun" also reports that Japanese Prime Minister Konoe, Foreign Minister Matsuoka, Army Minister Tojo, and newly appointed Navy Minister Oikawa held a two-hour meeting to discuss Japan's new southern advance policy. (United Press report, 6th)

Vichy: The Foreign Ministry office here announced last night that French-Japanese military talks were still in progress yesterday, aiming to establish a military agreement as a prelude to Japan and Annam (Vietnam) concluding an economic pact. A Foreign Ministry spokesperson explained that France will not consider Japan's demands for naval and air bases in Vietnam and the right for Japanese troops to pass through Annam as an ultimatum. Meanwhile, the Chinese Embassy here stated that the extension of French-Japanese talks allows Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to take the opportunity to move Chinese troops to the Annam border, making it the right flank of the Chinese army. The embassy continued that even if Japanese troops were to advance from Annam via the Red River Strait, the Chinese side can guarantee that they would find it difficult to reach Chinese territory and advance upstream along the Yangtze River. (United Press report, 6th)

Saigon: Maritime traffic between Vietnam and Eastern ports, which was temporarily suspended due to recent tensions between France and Japan, resumed as usual yesterday. (Reuters report, 6th)

Tokyo: Foreign Ministry spokesperson Suma, when hosting a press interview today, claimed that the Japanese government has ordered General Nishihara, head of the Japanese Supervisory Group stationed in Vietnam, to conduct negotiations with the French authorities in Vietnam in a peaceful and orderly manner. He also stated that the United States has no reason to be alarmed about the situation in Vietnam. He had read U.S. Secretary of State Hull's statement on the matter on Wednesday and emphatically stated that the Japanese government does not wish to respond to Hull's statement. (Reuters report, 6th)

Tokyo: Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Suma recently told the press that French-Japanese negotiations are progressing peacefully and that there is no reason to be alarmed about the situation in Vietnam. Suma also said that he was unaware of foreign reports of Japanese troops landing in Hanoi. (United Press report, 6th)

Chongqing: The "Ta Kung Pao" here reports that although the Vichy government has in principle allowed Japanese troops to pass through Vietnam, it is reported that the Vietnamese authorities insist on strictly specifying the areas through which Japanese troops may pass and the time limit for passage. Japan requested the cancellation of certain restrictions but was rejected by the Vietnamese authorities, which led to the Japanese ultimatum. This action was opposed by the Tokyo authorities and was therefore withdrawn. Furthermore, according to Kunming telegrams, the wireless telephone connection between that city and Hanoi is expected to be restored today. (Reuters report, 6th)

London: British Foreign Secretary Halifax declared in the House of Lords yesterday that there have been notable developments outside of Europe. The British government has received reports that a Japanese military mission has made certain demands on Vietnam. He immediately instructed the British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, to bring these reports to the attention of the Japanese government and to reiterate the British government's concern about maintaining the status quo in Vietnam. At the same time, U.S. Secretary of State Hull also issued a statement saying that the U.S. government attaches importance to the Vietnam situation. (Reuters report, 6th)

Berlin: According to the most well-informed German sources here yesterday, Japan has been making regular and detailed reports to Germany on all its actions and intentions in Annam (Vietnam), so Germany is fully aware of all secrets in the Far East. However, German officials, on the other hand, are refusing to criticize Japan's demands on Annam because the current situation has not yet been determined. Well-informed sources believe that the close and friendly relationship between Japan and Germany is sufficient to ensure that the Annam problem can be resolved. They firmly believe that the rights Japan seeks in Annam are purely economic in nature, and also, due to the needs of the war against China, it hopes to obtain practical military benefits, without any territorial ambitions. All parties here believe that the gradual development of relations between Japan and Annam will ultimately be the same as Germany's relations with the Balkan countries. Germany now regards a part of the Balkans as its main sphere of economic interest. (United Press report, 6th)

Chongqing: Well-informed sources recently told a United Press reporter that there is now a large Japanese fifth column working in Vietnam, numbering over 3,000, all of whom are armed and their numbers are increasing rapidly. They also said that intelligence personnel composed of Japanese and Vietnamese who support Japan all carry pistols.

Hanoi: When the Japanese delegation held negotiations with the authorities of the French protectorate of Vietnam on the second of this month, certain urgent demands were made, causing the situation to suddenly become tense. However, Japanese Supervisory Chief Major General Nishihara did not insist on these demands, and therefore the two sides resumed talks. The main goal is to discuss the implementation methods of the diplomatic agreement recently concluded between the French and Japanese governments in Tokyo. Vietnamese Governor-General Lieutenant General Decoux has maintained contact with the French government, so all negotiation processes have been reported to the central government. As for the current situation, it is natural for the Vietnamese authorities to take various military precautions. As of now, the residents of Vietnam, including French expatriates and natives, are all unusually calm. (Havas News Agency report, 6th)

### Hull's Original Statement on the Vietnam Situation

Washington: U.S. Secretary of State Hull stated yesterday that Britain is extremely concerned about Japan's actions in Vietnam, and he recalled Japan's recent statements in favor of maintaining the status quo in the Pacific to express his intention. Hull said that he had heard press reports that "Japanese military authorities have delivered an ultimatum to the French authorities in Vietnam, demanding to pass troops through Vietnam and to use Vietnamese bases to fight against China. We recall that in recent months, the U.S. government, several other national governments, and even the Japanese government have expressed their willingness to respect and maintain the status quo in the Pacific, and specifically mentioned maintaining the status quo of the Dutch East Indies and French Indochina. Since news of Japan's delivery of an ultimatum to the Vietnamese authorities lacks official confirmation, the U.S. government is not in a position to believe it to be true. However, the situation and issues involved in this news are considered by the U.S. government to be extremely important events. If the news proves to be well-founded, the impact on American public opinion will be unimaginable." In answering an inquiry, Hull also said that to his knowledge, the situation in Vietnam has nothing to do with the return to Shanghai this week of U.S. Rear Admiral Hart, commander of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet. (United Press report, 6th)

Washington: Reliable sources recently told the United Press that British diplomats had discussed the Far East situation and the Dutch East Indies oil issue with U.S. Secretary of State Hull. The British diplomats who met with Hull were British Ambassador to the U.S. Lord Lothian, Australia's first Minister to the U.S. Casey, and British Imperial Oil Production Supervisor Agnew. Agnew's participation in the discussion is generally considered to be very important. (United Press report, 6th)

### Disagreement Between Japanese Army and Navy

Chongqing: The authorities here are not surprised by Japan's withdrawal of the ultimatum to Vietnam, believing that Japan never intended to use force in Vietnam. This ultimatum was just a kind of intimidation, hoping to make the other party concede without war. The Chinese opinion here is that since this intimidation was exposed, Japan decided to abandon its invasion plan. The recent news of the resignation of the Japanese Navy Minister is generally considered to be the first indication of a divergence of opinion at the highest command level in Japan. According to information received by Chinese people here, the Japanese Navy strongly opposed the Army's proposed plan to seize Vietnam. People here believe that the Japanese Navy Minister's announcement of his resignation due to illness on the eve of the Japanese military's proposed landing implies the Navy's determination to oppose this policy. Well-informed sources believe that although the Japanese Navy Minister has resigned, the Navy's attitude will remain unchanged, because the Japanese Navy has always opposed policies that seem likely to offend Britain and the United States. Chinese military sources believe that the Japanese do not urgently want to occupy Vietnam, especially during this season of frequent heavy rains. Even if Japan attempts to invade, it will probably do so in early November when the weather is more conducive to large-scale operations. If the Japanese were to advance westward from Longzhou along the Vietnamese border to spy on Kunming, it would be more convenient than taking the route through Vietnam. A Chinese military spokesperson recently issued a statement, saying that the Japanese are now concentrating a fifth division in the Longzhou area, moving towards Zhennanguan. It is reported that French railway traffic continues to run across the border as usual. Observers here are speculating about the impact of Japan's withdrawal of the ultimatum. Some believe that this move may make Britain's attitude towards the Burma Road issue tougher. After the French exposed Japan's "intimidation," Britain and the United States expect Japan not to resort to force rashly, so their attitude towards Japan may become tougher. Others believe that Japan may take new and unexpected actions elsewhere to offset the domestic and international impact of the Vietnam situation. According to sources here, there is still no news of Germany and Italy participating in the French-Japanese talks. (Reuters report, 6th)

Editorial

### The Seriousness of the Housing Problem in Shanghai

The internal unrest in Shanghai society initially only affected the laboring classes at the lower and middle levels. Recently, the impact of severe living conditions has also shaken the lives of the general middle and upper-class wage earners. The reason for this is that the high price of food is a fatal blow to the lives of the masses. If you ask what people eat, fish, meat, chicken, and duck are indispensable; vegetables and fruits are also essential. However, even with these vegetables, there is only the hope of quenching thirst with plums. Who is responsible for this? Who caused this? Is it the result of insufficient supply and demand? Or is it the harm of the falling value of the legal tender? These are all superficial views and talk about signs. What is truly important is that if there were no so-called controls, the transportation of goods would certainly not be so difficult and obstructed; if there were no so-called external transport, supply and demand would certainly not be as uneven as it is now; if there were no so-called arbitrary taxes and levies, prices would certainly not be so expensive to this point! However, this is only in terms of a portion of food. Today, there is a problem in living that is no less difficult than this, which is the general housing problem.

Since prices have risen sharply and exorbitant profits have flowed in, it can instantly lead to great wealth. In general, those who own real estate are all eager and ready to raise rents. If they fail to raise rents, they resort to the law. If resorting to the law is ineffective, they say they will renovate, rebuild, or order tenants to move. Or they say that water costs are too high, restricting water supply. Or they say that there is no money for repairs, leaving the house to leak in the rain and be battered by the wind. In short, they create all kinds of inconveniences and difficulties for tenants in order to force them to comply with their attempts to raise rents. If tenants do not comply with their demands, they make it impossible for them to live in peace for even a day, forcing them to seek other places to live. Even landlords who regard contracts as sacred and inviolable when their houses are vacant are now tearing them up. Some raise rents three or four times a year, and some raise them by as much as 70 or 80 percent at a time. There are also those who pretend to sell or change rental agents in order to renegotiate contracts and force rent increases. In fact, the validity of a contract is not affected by changes in property rights and can be ignored. But when the contract expires, they can still make demands as they wish. What is most lamentable is that some entrust the management of real estate to foreign companies, using "foreign" power to deal with tenants. When tenants refuse to raise the rent and argue with the landlords, they even say, "You can go and sue in the Consular Court!" How can they be so unscrupulous? Let us not discuss "boiling beans to burn stalks, beans weeping in the pot." Even if the landlord is a foreign company, and much less a front for a foreign company, they should file a lawsuit in a Chinese court. However, people's hearts are overwhelmed by material desires, disregarding the law and reason, and showing no consideration for human feelings. They only know how to enrich themselves, ignoring others, and do not even consider the consequences of "enriching" themselves, or how it will be beneficial or harmful. They are good at short-term planning but poor at long-term planning, and it is impossible to talk to these Chinese and foreign real estate merchants who value profits over righteousness.

Although landlords can be blamed, there are also tenants who, due to the landlords' insatiable demands, pass them on to their subtenants. Thus, those who become sublandlords invariably take advantage of the landlords' rent increases to greatly increase their subrental prices. Considering the millions of people in the Shanghai concessions, only a small number own their own homes. A larger number rent houses to live in alone, but even that is not as large as the number who rent a single room to live in. Sublandlords are also like landlords. Not all landlords are bad, and there are many who understand the pain of tenants and are unwilling to raise rents. Sublandlords, being tenants themselves, seem to be ignorant of the suffering of borrowing a house to live in. Therefore, many will simply allocate the rent increase imposed by the landlord to the tenants according to the size and location of the subrented rooms, which is certainly a fair way to handle it. But bad sublandlords are different. They actually use the houses they rent as a means of profit. This can be seen in the rental advertisements in the newspapers, where subrentals even require key money. Some also require two or three months' rent as a deposit. A single wing room costs no less than a hundred dollars; a front room or a side room costs no less than forty or fifty dollars to rent. Attics and kitchen sheds are rented for thirty or forty dollars. It has also been heard that someone rented out half of the front of a three-story loft for a monthly rent of twenty dollars and a decoration fee of two hundred dollars. According to those who make a business of renting out houses, someone rented a double house for a monthly rent of over one hundred dollars and then received a monthly rental income of four hundred and eighty dollars after subletting. Although this is said to be done by a very small number of people, given the large profits involved, there should be more and more people who use subletting houses as a business, and they do not hesitate to pay key money, tips, and rent to secure a house for subletting. This has made the amount of rent, key money, and tips larger and larger, making it impossible for honest people to find even a small space to live in. They still have to beg for mercy from sublandlords who are in business for profit. The seriousness of this unfair burden is not difficult to express.

What will be the result of following this path? Since the goal is to make a profit, everything other than "profit" will certainly be ignored. To exhaust the harm: (1) The rights of the contracting tenant are invisibly undermined, resulting in extortion and forced eviction. Living in instability and restlessness, they will inevitably use forcing tenants to leave as a means of repeatedly raising rents, and thus the unrest in society will deepen. (2) As rents rise and prices become more expensive, the landlords (including both landlords and sublandlords) will make unlimited demands, and there will inevitably come a day when some will be unable to pay the rent. (3) As rents become more expensive, the division and subdivision of houses will increase, leading to not just "pigeonholes" within a building, but also to the ancient practice of living in caves and bees living in hives together. (4) As houses are divided into more and more sublets, it becomes easier for fires and epidemics to occur, which will ultimately affect fire protection, security, and public health. (5) Men and women mix, and people of different characters live together. Immoral winds grow, and bad habits become ingrained, which will make social morality decline further and further, threatening to fundamentally destroy the organization of society. This is only speaking of the greatest harms, and the intangible sins are innumerable.

So how can we seek redress? It is not difficult: "The point of governing is not to talk much, but to consider how to act!" Today's governance talks too much, but action does not match words. For example, in controlling the rise in rents, society is not without organization. It exists, but there is much talk and no action! This has led to the current state of affairs. I believe that livelihood issues do not benefit one side, and there are too many legal issues involved. Therefore, the government should issue clear orders, taking into account the interests of both sides, and have the following expedient measures.

(1) All rents (whether whole or sublet) shall be legally fixed at a certain date as the standard, and there shall be no further increases. However, if there is an increase in taxes or if the rent includes water and electricity costs, and the water and electricity costs increase, the amount of the increase shall be fairly distributed among the tenants.

(2) New houses may be priced according to their land value and construction costs, plus reasonable profits and the necessary expenses of the house, as a standard for setting rents. After that, except in the circumstances of the second item of the preceding article, no rent shall be increased.

(3) Tenants who sublet the remaining rooms to others shall, based on the size of the sublet room and the quality of its equipment, plus reasonable expenses from the rent paid, estimate and set the rent that should be earned for that portion of the sublet room. Subtenants shall also be entitled to the protection of rental prices under the provisions of the preceding two articles.

(4) The landlord shall not force the tenant to move for the purpose of increasing the rent or failing to increase the rent, except for arrears in rent.

(5) Once a tenant's right to rent has been contractually established, if there is no breach of contract, he shall still have the right to continue renting under the original contract upon expiration of the contract.

(6) If the landlord forces a rent increase or oppresses the tenant in any way, the tenant may apply to the local police or court to stop it.

(7) If the landlord and tenant have to increase or decrease the original rent for unavoidable reasons, they shall petition the court to decide. Before a decision is made, the original lease shall be performed, and neither party shall take any action to damage the other party's interests.

The above is presented as a measure suitable for the times and adapted to circumstances. If the authorities truly know to place importance on people's livelihoods and security, then for food and housing issues, they should carefully redress the situation and make it a reality, so that the whole society is not uneasy for a long time and that empty words are not used to gloss over the past.

It is reported that the State Department has not yet had real negotiations on the bases of the Galapagos Islands and Cocos Island. Recently, Navy Secretary Knox stated in San Francisco that the United States needs to seek defense bases in the Galapagos Islands and Cocos Island, but I believe that real negotiations on leasing these islands to Ecuador and Costa Rica separately are in progress.

### U.S. Large Quantities of Military Supplies to Be Shipped to Canada

Washington: New York Mayor La Guardia, a member of the U.S.-Canada Joint Defense Committee, hinted yesterday that cooperation between the U.S. and Canada could allow large quantities of U.S. military supplies to be shipped to the Canadian border. After dining with President Roosevelt, La Guardia announced that the United States will build two naval and air bases in Newfoundland.

(United Press report, 6th)

### American Newspapers Praise Roosevelt's Courage

New York: American newspaper tycoon Hearst wrote an article in his published newspapers on the U.S. government giving fifty destroyers to Britain, saying: "Citizens, we are now at war. This action has been taken, and the die is cast. Roosevelt has finally moved forward. What he wants is to involve us in the war through the election. He has obviously realized this. Now only short-sighted people do not want to fight. They harbor narrow-minded prejudices because they have to join the army. The only question now is what kind of retaliatory plan will those whom we regard as enemies take. It is expected that the first action of the Axis powers will probably be to conclude a defensive alliance with Japan." Other newspapers mostly agree with this action. Some see it as greatly beneficial to U.S. self-defense, some see it as mutually beneficial to Britain and the United States, some praise Roosevelt's courage, and some say that this action should have been taken earlier. Some say that the Axis powers thought that the United States would not dare to take courageous action during the presidential election, and today's action will surprise the Axis powers. The Washington Post said, "We can now easily obtain benefits by dividing, and huge changes require courageous action to deal with them. The English democratic countries have shown in the current changes that they have the necessary perseverance, vision, determination to quickly take courageous action." (Reuters report, 6th)

### The Central Farmer's Bank Revises Agricultural Loan Methods

Chongqing – In the past, the Central Farmer's Bank adopted two methods for lending to farmers: cooperative credit lending and farmers' movable property mortgage. Since implementation, these methods have been quite effective. The bank has now carefully researched and formulated the "Regulations on Movable Property Indirect Possession Pledge Lending for Farmers" based on past experience. The main purpose is to enable farmers to obtain credit through movable property pledges, while still being able to continue to possess the movable property. This eliminates the trouble of organizing cooperatives and does not hinder production and operation. After the implementation of this method, even immature seedlings and livestock being raised can be used as collateral to obtain funds, which invisibly accelerates the reproduction of agricultural funds, making it an ideal agricultural loan method.

### German Planes Launch Large-Scale Night Attack on Britain – London Suffers Unprecedented Devastating Bombing – Bombing Range Reaches Thirty-Two Districts – Fires Break Out Everywhere, Casualties Heavy

Dublin – At 9:15 last night, a large number of German bombers appeared over London and began an unprecedentedly fierce bombing, which continued until 5:00 this morning. The death toll is feared to be very high. It is reported that some bombs hit a hospital, damaging two buildings, and several fires broke out. (Sixth Reuters Dispatch)

London – Today, Nazi planes bombed thirty-two districts in the London area and carried out massacres and destruction in towns and villages throughout Britain. As a result, twenty-eight German planes were shot down. Since last night, German planes have been attacking London almost continuously. Throughout the night and into this morning, German planes continued to bomb fiercely. Within a radius of fifteen miles from the center of London, German planes dropped more than fifty high-explosive bombs and more than one hundred incendiary bombs. This morning, fires broke out in three or four residential and commercial areas. The largest fire was at the Woolworths store, the second large store to be destroyed in ten days. However, the fires in other places were quickly extinguished. This morning, at least ten people were killed and hundreds injured in the London area. Two emergency alerts were issued in London, the first at 9:58 and the second at 12:55 this afternoon. Last night, hundreds of people narrowly escaped disaster when a huge public air-raid shelter was hit by a bomb. Fortunately, only a few people had taken refuge in it at the time, so there were only a few casualties. (Sixth United Press Dispatch)

London – Yesterday, German bombers continued to launch large-scale attacks on British cities, and a night attack on the London area. Officials announced that at least 34 German planes had been shot down, and the British side lost a total of 12 fighter planes, but the pilots of three of them landed safely. After 11:00 pm yesterday, a large number of German bombers flew across the east coast into the mainland, and the London area suffered an extremely barbaric attack. It is estimated that the number of enemy planes flying over the London area since the start of the war was the highest last night. It is reported that many incendiary bombs and whistling bombs have been dropped on London. After a German plane dropped flares, there was a loud noise, shaking houses. Until late last night, it was reported that German bombers had appeared in more than eight towns and cities outside the London area. According to an announcement by the Air Ministry, transportation in the southern part of London was slightly disrupted after being attacked yesterday morning, and damage elsewhere was minor. A few bombs also fell in the Welsh area yesterday, damaging a small chapel, but there were no reports of casualties. Yesterday afternoon, British fighter planes fought bravely and repelled German planes attempting to attack British airfields. An Air Ministry communiqué reviewing yesterday's battle situation stated that the enemy air force launched another attack yesterday afternoon. A large number of enemy planes crossed the Kent coast and divided into two groups, aided by a small number of enemy planes that flew across the coast later, attempting to attack airfields on both sides of the Thames River, but were all met and driven back by British fighter planes. A factory on one side of the Thames River was hit and slightly damaged, but the German planes did not succeed in attacking other places. There have been no reports of casualties so far. The results of the air raid yesterday morning were very few casualties. Some areas of Kent were hit by bombs, causing minor damage. (Sixth Reuters)

### Berlin Issued Air Raid Alert Yesterday

Berlin – Regarding the attempted bombing of Berlin by British planes last night, the responsible authorities issued a communiqué at 2:00 a.m. this morning, stating that the air raid alert in the German capital last night was issued shortly after midnight. The enemy planes were detected and driven away before reaching Berlin, so the alert was lifted shortly afterwards. (Sixth Haitong Dispatch)

### British Air Force Launches Raid Deep into Eastern Germany – 1,200 Miles from Base – Attacks Military Targets with Considerable Success

London – It was revealed today that on the night of the 4th of this month, British bombers penetrated deep into eastern Germany, flying to Politz, a few miles north of Stettin on the Baltic coast, and bombed the artificial oil plant there. This was one of the British Air Force's farthest bombing raids into Germany, covering a total of 1,200 miles, mostly flying in enemy territory. Before the British planes took off, the pilots were excited to hear that they would be flying even farther than Berlin. One said, "After this flight, flying to the Ruhr will be child's play." It is reported that the raid was extremely successful. One pilot dived low to bomb, and saw the bomb land in the center of the oil plant. Soon after, the tall chimneys all collapsed and a fire broke out. The flames could still be seen 70 miles away. The remaining British planes continued to drop bombs, hitting a factory, with fires burning in fifteen places. According to reports from British planes attacking the Sulengqi Ya forest, the forest was bombed and caught fire, burning for 80 miles. The British Air Force also bombed power stations and aircraft factories in Berlin that night. Other targets attacked included oil tanks in Meichibao, freight yards in Nienburg, and several airfields in the occupied areas of France. Two British planes did not return, and one crashed while landing. In addition, British coastal planes attacked the Charlesburg oil ponds and docks. (Sixth Reuters Dispatch)

### Britain Determined to Provide Full Assistance if Greece is Invaded – British Interests Damaged in Romania – Will Detain Ships in Retaliation – Halifax's Statement in the House of Lords

London – British Foreign Secretary Halifax reported on the situation in Romania in the House of Lords yesterday, saying that the recent actions of the Romanian government have directly harmed the interests of British shipping and oil industries. The British government has notified the Romanian government that if British interests are still treated in this way, there is no possibility of developing British-Romanian trade, and that the British government may detain Romanian ships in retaliation. Romania quickly fell into the embrace of Germany and abandoned British guarantees. There is no doubt now that Romania recognizes the value of the guarantees given by the Axis powers. The Foreign Secretary then spoke of Greece, saying that what Italy has accused Greece of is completely untrue. The Greek government and people have remained calm and unshaken in the face of Italian newspapers' intimidation and provocation, and are still committed to maintaining their neutrality, but have also decided to defend their integrity and independence to resist foreign aggression. If there is any action that clearly undermines the independence of Greece, the British government feels obliged to provide Greece with all kinds of assistance within its power.

### King Carol of Romania Abdicates – New Monarch Michael Ascends the Throne – Former King Issues Painful Edict to the Nation – Earnestly Urging Loyalty and Diligence for the Country

Romanian Capital – King Carol of Romania abdicated at 5:00 a.m. today. His abdication edict advocates for his nineteen-year-old son Michael to be King. King Carol's resignation was caused by the public pressure caused by Romania's submission to the Axis powers' arbitration at the Vienna Conference last week, ceding most of Outer Transylvania to Hungary. The public wanted his abdication, and the inauguration of the new Prime Minister Antonescu yesterday caused him to lose most of his power. King Carol had no choice but to seek a way out of the difficult situation. (Sixth United Press Dispatch)

Romanian Capital – Romanian Crown Prince Michael was sworn in at 9:30 a.m. this morning. The President of the Court of Appeal, Radulescu, and Prime Minister General Antonescu were present at the ceremony. (Sixth Haitong Dispatch)

Romanian Capital – According to an official announcement, King Carol of Romania has abdicated to Crown Prince Michael. According to the German official news agency, King Carol will travel to Switzerland within days. King Carol's abdication edict stated: "The country is now in great danger. With my patriotic ambition, I am willing to pass this heavy responsibility on to my son, so that this crisis can be alleviated. I silently pray that this sacrifice will not be in vain. I hope that all Romanians will show fervent and absolute loyalty to my son, so that he may receive the assistance he needs in the heavy responsibilities he will bear in the future. May God bless my country and give it a bright future." (Sixth Reuters Dispatch)

Romanian Capital – Romanian Prime Minister Antonescu issued a special communiqué this morning, which was broadcast by Romanian wireless radio, and newspapers published extra editions, publishing the communiqué. The content is as follows: "Romanian compatriots, I urge you to forget everything of the past, and hope that the youth of the country will unite, love the King, maintain the laws and order of the country together, and continue to serve the country as usual. Long live Romania! Signed, General Antonescu." (Sixth Haitong Dispatch)

Romanian Capital – The gloomy and depressing atmosphere that has permeated the Romanian capital for days has now disappeared. National flags are flying in the city, and the atmosphere is renewed. The Iron Guard is also very active, with thousands of people parading in lines, singing long-banned songs, and marching towards the Royal Palace. When the young monarch Michael stood on the balcony and raised his arm to greet the people, the cheers were endless. (Sixth Haitong Dispatch)

Romanian Capital – Former King Carol of Romania flew to the Yugoslavian capital this morning to visit his sister, the Queen Mother of Southern State. Another plane will carry personnel from the former Royal Palace to Florence, Italy, to welcome Queen Helen back to the country as the Queen Mother of Romania. (Sixth Reuters Dispatch)

Romanian Capital – Reliable sources said this morning that Romanian Prime Minister Antonescu has decided to allow Hungary to occupy Outer Transylvania and does not intend to resist the conflict. Therefore, the Prime Minister ordered General Tragalina and General Stadte to enter the capital to avoid war. (Sixth Haitong Dispatch)

### King Carol's Abdication – Pro-British Cabinet Members Lose Freedom

Romanian Capital – Yesterday, the Romanian police dispersed some members of the Iron Guard. Prime Minister Antonescu was furious upon hearing this and demanded that King Carol abdicate last night. Negotiations lasted for several hours. Some Romanian generals advised the King not to abdicate, but the Prime Minister arrested them, especially Chief of Staff General Song Hail. Seeing that the situation was irreversible, Carol promised to abdicate at 6:00 a.m. this morning, and then set off to escape to Switzerland. (Sixth Haitong Dispatch)

Romanian Capital – New Prime Minister Antonescu has ordered restrictions on the freedom of movement of former Prime Minister Tătărescu, Arghetuianu, and several other former cabinet members, as well as several former cabinet members who participated in the sanctions against Italy. Romanian industrialist and arms magnate Malaxes also received the same punishment. All of the above will be handed over to the court and charged with subverting the state. In addition, there is another case, namely that the funds for purchasing a large amount of armaments are of unknown use. (Sixth Reuters Dispatch)

### Iron Guard Members Demonstrate and Riot – Clash with Royal Palace Guards

Romanian Capital – More than 10,000 members of the Romanian Iron Guard rioted last night, attacking the Royal Palace and forcing Carol to step down, resulting in street fighting in the center of the Romanian capital, with many casualties. The troops guarding the Royal Palace swept the rioting crowd with machine guns, finally driving them back. The riot occurred after the Romanian King transferred his dictatorial powers to General Antonescu and agreed to exile Lupu. It is rumored that Antonescu will announce a ceasefire with the Iron Guard, and then consult with Carol, who is no different from a criminal in the Royal Palace. Antonescu has now become the dictator of Romania, and Romania is under the rule of the Fascist government, similar to Italy. (Sixth International News Agency Dispatch)

Romanian Capital – A huge demonstration was held in the city of Romanian Capital yesterday, resulting in a clash between the troops loyal to King Carol and those loyal to Antonescu. Police fired several shots from police cars, warning the crowd. The crowd moved back and forth in the streets, while police cars patrolled the city full of police officers carrying machine guns. The event occurred because supporters of the King demonstrated against the new Prime Minister Antonescu yesterday. By 9:35 p.m., the police had dispersed the crowd, but at this time another group of demonstrators, about 1,000 men and women, gathered at the gate of the Royal Palace, singing Iron Guard patriotic songs. At the same time, it was learned here that General Antonescu had advised the heads of the press yesterday not to attack the Romanian King and his throne, but he personally repeatedly stated that the Romanian King should abdicate immediately. He said that the impulsive patriots were supporters of the King. The Prime Minister's support for the Axis powers and the Vienna decision is now widely believed to mean that he will not oppose Hungarian troops entering Outer Transylvania. (Sixth United Press Dispatch)

### Hungarian Troops Enter Romanian Ceded Area – Patriotic Romanian Troops Resist Furiously

Kurusu – Romanian troops repelled Hungarian troops who advanced into Outer Transylvania ahead of schedule yesterday, resulting in the deaths of two Romanian soldiers and the injury of one, and the deaths of two Hungarian soldiers. A Romanian major reported the details of the conflict, saying that the Romanian troops were firmly defending their positions ten kilometers from the Hungarian outposts. He said that the Romanian retreat was a "painful matter," and declared, "Many officers were weeping." (Sixth United Press Dispatch)

Hungarian Capital – The Hungarian General Staff announced that Hungarian troops entered Outer Transylvania yesterday according to plan, without incident. However, it said that the withdrawing Romanian troops carried away the radium tablets from a hospital and recently distributed shotguns to Hungarian residents. (Sixth Reuters Dispatch)

### Churchill Reports on the War Situation: Britain's Position is Better Than Before; Naval and Air Force Equipment is Sufficient to Resist Strong Attacks; Strong Forces Have Been Sent to Reinforce the Middle East

London - Prime Minister Churchill briefly described the war situation in the House of Commons yesterday, saying that Britain's position today is indeed better than it was a few months ago. This is due to the active preparations in the country and the dispatch of fresh troops to support the eastern Mediterranean. However, the people should not think that the danger of Britain being invaded has passed. The Prime Minister expressed satisfaction with the Anglo-American naval agreement, saying that the American sky and sea borders have extended deep into the Atlantic over a vast area, and the fifty American destroyers handed over to Britain can be said to make up for the deficiencies in the service of warships built during Britain's wartime program. The Prime Minister spoke of the British air war, saying that the German air force had suffered heavy damage. In terms of the number of aircraft, the losses were three to one, and in terms of personnel, the losses were six to one. The number of British air force is now greater than in July, and the equipment is also more complete. He is confident that it can resist stronger attacks from the German side, but the people must not say that the danger of invasion has now passed. The Secretary of War advised the people to be prepared for everything, which is appropriate. Some people say that after September 15, the last date for the invasion of Britain mentioned by Hitler, Britain can avoid the danger of overseas attacks. I don't think so. Although winter winds and rains often occur, fog is thick, and the weather is dark, it may change the situation, but we must not relax in the slightest. I said that our situation is better now than in July. I am not revealing any military secrets, but if the British problem felt difficult in June, it will feel even more difficult in September. National defense arrangements have moved forward on a large scale. We have been able to send reinforcements to the Middle East one after another. A few days ago, we sent several of our strongest and newest warships to the eastern Mediterranean, almost doubling the strength of the fleet there. Although this action was known to the Italian side, it was not disturbed by the Italian side. Some British ships will go to Malta and carry some of the materials needed to defend Malta. We anticipate a fierce battle in the Middle East soon. We are determined to maintain our position in the Middle East with the greatest strength and increase our naval power. This is true in the eastern Mediterranean, and it is also true in the western Mediterranean. The Prime Minister spoke of the German air raids, saying that the method of air raid alarms must be greatly changed. If the alarm is sounded two or three times a day in a large area simply because enemy planes are traveling to unpredictable targets, it is useless and not beneficial. Therefore, I plan to ask the relevant administrative departments to review this matter again. The street lamp problem is being studied, and the responsible departments are discussing how to make the streets brighter and make pedestrians happier during the winter months. Finally, the Prime Minister said that no matter what changes occur, we will move forward along this path at home and abroad. (Reuters, 6th)

Satisfied with US-British Cooperation

London - Amid cheers in the House of Commons yesterday, Prime Minister Churchill reported on the eternally memorable exchange between Britain and the United States, saying that as far as I know, the completion of this matter has made the people of Britain and the United States very satisfied, and the friends of our world will also be excited about it. The value of this matter can be clearly seen in the official documents. It would be a mistake to seek other meanings outside of this. This exchange is purely a plan for mutual assistance between two friendly countries in the spirit of trust, sympathy, and goodwill. Only the ignorant would make the statement that the transfer of American ships to Britain is an act that violates international law. Hitler certainly does not like this matter. I know that if Hitler had the opportunity, he would retaliate against the United States. The British Admiralty is pleased to have these fifty destroyers. We will put the American destroyers into active service as soon as possible. British sailors are waiting at the port of delivery to take over.

Involving the Balkan Situation

The Prime Minister spoke of Romania, saying that in my personal opinion, southern Dobruja should be returned to Bulgaria, and the treatment Hungary received in the last war also made me unhappy. However, we do not want to recognize any land changes that occur during wartime unless they have obtained the free permission and goodwill of the parties concerned. No one can predict where Hitler's empire will expand to when the current war is not over, but I believe that this kind of empire will soon be destroyed quickly.

Britain Can Cope with the Air War

The Prime Minister spoke of the general air war, saying that the air war was very active in July, but August was the real month of battle. However, neither side exerted its full strength. The German side made a great effort to gain air superiority, using more planes than we used to fight back. The attempt to break through the British air defenses has proven to be very costly. The loss of three planes for one and six pilots for one does not include all the losses suffered by the German side. We must prepare for an even more intense war this month. The enemy has a great need for a quick victory. If Hitler really has the number of planes that we previously estimated, he should be able to strengthen his attack in September. However, the British Air Force officials are confident that we have the ability to cope with a large-scale air war. The German side claimed that 1,921 British planes were destroyed in July and August, but in fact, only 558 British planes were lost in these two months. The loss of British aviators is of course even less than this. I don't know if Hitler believes in the accuracy of his own figures. The world would like to see the enemy fall into the error of self-deception.

### Romania - Brief History of the Old and New Monarchs

Bucharest - The King of Romania, Michael, who ascended the throne today, is only nineteen years old and has already ascended the throne twice. Michael was born on October 25, 1921. In 1927, after the death of his grandfather Ferdinand, Michael ascended the throne, and power was exercised by several regents. In 1930, his father Carol returned to the country, and Michael abdicated. Carol ascended the throne on June 8 of that year. Michael received excellent training in his childhood. He grew up at the age of fifteen, and his physique was larger than his father's. Moreover, because of his participation in the Romanian youth organization, he had a lot of contact with Romanian youth and was loved by the people. Michael not only has excellent military training, but also has devoted himself to the study of politics and science. He can speak four languages: German, Italian, English, and French, and he speaks fluently, which is enough to show that he is extraordinarily intelligent. (Haitong News Agency, 6th)

Bucharest - King Carol I of Romania was born in 1893. He studied at the University of Bucharest and the Joses Officer School. When Romania participated in the First European War and fought alongside the Allied Powers, Carol served as the commander of a legion. After the European War, he traveled around the world. In 1921, he married Princess Helen of Greece. Because the Liberal Party had disagreements with him, he traveled abroad for five years before returning to the country. Carol ascended the throne on June 8, 1930, and abdicated to Crown Prince Michael after ten years on the throne. (Haitong News Agency, 6th)

### Romania Decides to Strengthen Relations with the Axis Powers - New Prime Minister's Statement After Taking Office - New Cabinet Being Organized

Bucharest - After being sworn in as the new Prime Minister of Romania, General Antonescu, his first action was to announce his intention to strengthen Romania's relations with the Axis powers, and at the same time, he declared that there would be no armed resistance against Hungary's occupation of Outer Transylvania. (Reuters, 5th)

Bucharest - The candidates for the new Romanian cabinet have not yet been determined. According to unconfirmed rumors, General Antonescu's new cabinet will have Liberal Party leader Bratianu as Foreign Minister, Iron Guard leader Pima as Interior Minister, and Consinov as Minister of Economy, while Finance Minister Leon will be the only old cabinet member in the new cabinet. (Haitong News Agency, 6th)

Berlin - Close attention is being paid here to the recent developments in Romania. Judging from the news obtained by Berlin up to yesterday afternoon, the solution to the current Romanian problem, although it is a domestic affair, seems to be the appropriate way to stabilize the tense situation. At the same time, Berlin believes that German-Romanian relations will become increasingly friendly. General Antonescu has created a strong central government to lead Romania, which can be called the characteristic of the new order within Romania. The participation of the Iron Guard in the new cabinet is likely to be realized. (Haitong News Agency, 6th)

Tokyo - The Japanese ship Kinsei Maru recently arrived at Kaohsiung Port in Taiwan from the South Seas. According to shipowner Yamada's conversation with a reporter from the Kokumin Shimbun, when the ship was sailing 12 miles outside Manila Port, it was attacked by an aircraft of unknown nationality. The aircraft circled several times in the sky and dropped a white object, which looked like a bomb, but it did not hit. The aircraft had blue wings, white stars painted under the wings, and the number 54 painted on the fuselage. (Havas News Agency, 5th)

### Random Notes on the European War (3) - On the Eve of the War - British Civil Life

In modern total warfare, the resistance and endurance of the entire nation of the belligerent countries have a great impact on the key to victory or defeat. This travelogue was written by an American, Amos Burg, and published in the August issue of the American Geographic Magazine this year. On the eve of the war, he sailed a small boat from London, went north along the Grand Canal to Liverpool, and his experiences along the way can be said to have been deeply rooted in British civil life. What he saw and heard cannot be compared with those who "took a quick look at the flowers" by plane or train. The translation is as follows:

Last summer, I and my friend sailed a Canadian-style canoe, the "Song of the Wind," from London, following the most fearful canal in England, through Birmingham to Liverpool, for a total of four weeks. This trip was like touring the rear of England, gaining a glimpse of the British national character from the side, and discovering the tenacious life of the residents along the canal, which cannot be seen by those who take a quick look at the flowers.

One morning, I stood by the dock lock in London, waiting for the Grand Canal Company to issue a "key" for passage. My friend drove the "Song of the Wind" and rowed to the commercial road lock to wait for me. The lock was the first lock on our way north.

The so-called "key" is actually a curved iron handle tied with a pink ribbon, which is used to open unattended locks. A technician from the Grand Canal Company solemnly handed this handle to me and said that I must pass through the Limehouse district before dusk to avoid the disturbance of children throwing stones. After speaking, he bowed and retreated.

Although the European War had not yet broken out at that time, a great disaster was imminent. The Grand Canal runs through the industrial area of central England, and motorboats tow barges carrying raw materials back and forth to help Britain reorganize its military preparations.

The British canal was dug 150 years ago, during the early rise of the steel and textile industries, to transport bulky goods such as coal and machinery, and to promote the industrial revolution. Then, with the advent of the railway, the canal lost its effectiveness and disappeared into obscurity for a hundred years. The goods transported by the canal during this period were as rare as morning stars.

Until the end of the nineteenth century, road and railway freight were overcrowded, so a part was diverted to the canal for transportation, and the Grand Canal shipping industry began to recover. In 1929, eleven old canals were connected to form a large canal, and a company was established to be responsible for dredging and repairing, and transforming new-style locks. The investment was huge, and the complex old canal was further improved. Later, stimulated by the reorganization of military preparations, shipping became more developed.

I applied to the Grand Canal Company for a pass to sail from London to Birmingham, which took a week to obtain, because barges traveled back and forth in the canal in an endless stream, and the boat would inevitably hinder traffic. But I brought the boat from Olai, USA, 6,000 miles to England, specifically for a tour, and finally obtained permission.

Americans are usually impatient and fully intend to launch the boat into the water and set off immediately. Unexpectedly, in the narrow river channel in the dock, there were many barges tied under the electric crane to load and unload scrap iron, copper, and steel for various factories in central England. There were also various ships that were blocking the way horizontally and vertically, and we could not pass through the dock to reach the entrance of the canal. In the end, we waited quietly until the next day before the start of freight traffic to set off early.

The next morning, we arrived at the dock, where there were few people. However, after the boat was launched, freight traffic was already active. We quickly rowed straight to the commercial road gate, obtained the gate opening handle from the Grand Canal Company, and drove through the London industrial area in one breath.

In the London district, barges in the canal are towed by horses, slowly moving forward at two miles per hour, and only ten miles a day. Once out of the London district, horses are rarely seen, and barges are towed by motor "fast boats" or "flying boats." It takes about 60 hours to reach Birmingham, which used to take a week without motorboats. These boats are painted with colorful patterns, 72 feet long and only 7 feet wide, so that they can pass through the narrowest locks.

The boatmen live on the water, and the old and young all live in small cabins painted with colorful paints at the stern. Young children also assist in boat operations. The long rudder of the barge is managed by the whole family in turn, and even the little daughter can do it, but the boatman himself is always busy operating the motorboat.

There are about 5,000 inland boatmen living on the British canals. A small number of boatmen in remote areas are no different from "water nomads"; however, the boatmen on the Grand Canal work hard all year round and have a lot of savings, so they cannot be called nomads.

The boatmen are not easily willing to talk to passing strangers. I stopped a barge and moored next to it to have a meal on the boat. I only saw the boatman's whole family working tirelessly. The boat woman was wiping the deck in the cabin, and the children were wiping copperware, ignoring me, as if the work was important and they had no time to care about other things.

After a while, the boatman went out and painted colorful fortresses or roses on the hull. Finally, he noticed me next to his boat and said, "Your boat needs to be painted with colorful colors, just like adding a new dress to your wife."

The boat woman interjected, "Painting the boat with colorful colors should be more diligent than adding a new dress, otherwise, the wind and rain will erode it, and it will be mottled like the lock gate."

I asked what the significance of painting the hull with colorful colors was. He replied, "There is no reason, but all barges are painted with fortresses and roses."

I suddenly remembered that the boatmen had a superstition that all barges must be painted with a fortress, otherwise they would sink.

The boatman also said that he has two children, and whenever the boat is moored, they take the opportunity to go to school for a few hours. Now they are waiting for the two children to finish their classes and return to the boat, and then they will set off for Birmingham. He was quite proud of this. It can be said that the children of British boatmen all study in various places whenever they have time on their journeys, which can be said to be a unique form of education.

In recent years, with the development of movies and radio, the isolation of canal boatmen from the outside world has been reduced a lot. At that time, the radio in the cabin of the barge was playing music. The boatman said, "We have listened to the radio broadcast of the coronation ceremony of the King of England."

The boat woman brought out fragrant tea to entertain the guests and gesticulated to describe the plot of the film "Mutiny on the Bounty" that she had watched the night before.

Before long, the boatman's children returned to the boat, so they untied the rope and left the shore, heading towards the pitch-black Islington Tunnel. I also rowed alongside them.

The Islington Tunnel passes through the densely populated industrial area of London, is one foot high, and is more than half a mile long. It was built in 1810. However, many of the residents above the tunnel do not know that there is such a tunnel underground. I waited for a tugboat to tow six barges and slowly drove out, and then I rowed into the tunnel, speeding towards a faint light at the other end.

When we reached Regent's Park, we were refreshed by the lush green scenery. From the start of the voyage to here, we had passed nearly a hundred factories and shipyards, with coal ash flying and noisy sounds. Regent's Park is different. Two or three tourists are either walking slowly under the green shade or taking off their shoes and lying on the grass, enjoying themselves leisurely. On holidays, there are many tourists, which shows how much the British love the fields and flowers. From the Cape in the south of England to the misty Orkney Islands in the north, the entire territory is like a large garden, and no effort is spared to preserve it. This is due to this love.

We arrived at Paddington Pond at sunset, eight miles from the starting point, but we were still not out of London, and we were still not out of the stone throwing area. After a while, children by the river threw stones at us. I complained to a police officer. Unexpectedly, the police officer was tolerant and replied, "These children have just left school and need to do some activities." I had no choice but to avoid the small hill in the pond. I drove away the ducks and climbed the hill to set up camp among a cluster of willow trees. Opposite was a row of old-fashioned factories and warehouses. It was amazing to be able to camp in the London area.

A British friend received my telegram and came with his wife to go boating. He casually joked with the children on the riverbank, and the children immediately responded with bricks and mud, throwing them at our faces like raindrops. I was forced to return to the small hill and sit down in the tent. Bricks were still falling around, and finally the tent was knocked down.

The next morning, we untied the rope and set off. In the western United States, the rivers are turbulent and the boats travel like arrows. The British Grand Canal has no tides at all, but the headwind is quite strong, and there is a tendency to blow the boat backwards. I imitated the method of horse-towing barges, and everyone took turns going ashore to tow the boat, and one person sat in the boat to steer.

After arriving at Cawley Lock, we left London and entered the green countryside. Looking around, the scenery was quiet. Farms were everywhere, and thatched cottages were scattered. The gardens were neat and tidy. I realized why British expats miss their hometowns so much.

The beauty of England is most easily seen in the small details. The houses in various places were built in different eras, some made of huge stones, some half-timbered, some covered with thatch, all of which were beautiful and moving, and in harmony with the surrounding scenery. England's foreign trade is the best in the world, and its population density is rare. Its countryside is so vast and spacious, which is almost disproportionate.

When the canal was first dug 150 years ago, the British regarded it as an "ugly ditch." So they planted grass and trees and built stone walls on the riverbank to hide this "trace" of copper stench. That's why I always sail between two rows of trees, a green shade, without seeing the villages on both sides of the farm for several miles. I can only climb the riverbank to get a glimpse of the scenery. (To be continued)

Education News

### Student Academic Performance Assessment Methods for Colleges and Universities - Strictly Implemented Starting This Semester

The Ministry of Education recently announced that although the level of students in colleges and universities has slightly improved compared with the past, the development of the quality of colleges and universities has not fully corresponded to the development of quantity. In order to improve the level of students in colleges and universities and seek the improvement of the quality of higher education, the main points of the student academic performance assessment methods for colleges and universities are specially formulated as follows:

(1) Temporary tests must be held at least once in each semester. The test papers should be properly preserved by the school. Within one year, the Ministry may order them to be called up for review at any time, or inspect them according to the curriculum when sending personnel for inspection.

(2) Students' usual lecture notes, reading notes, and reports on practice, internship, and experiments should be combined and calculated separately from the temporary tests as usual grades. The method of calling up for review is the same as in the previous article.

(3) Semester tests should be strictly implemented at the end of each semester and should not be held early. The results of the semester tests must be combined and calculated with the usual grades as the semester grades.

The results of the aforementioned semester tests must be made into a list and submitted to the Ministry for verification at the end of the semester. The Ministry may also randomly review the test papers of a certain subject at any time.

(4) Students who fail the semester test with a score of 40 or more but less than 60 may be given a supplementary test, but only once. Those who fail with a score of less than 40 are not allowed to take a supplementary test and should be ordered to retake the course. If the number of credits for failed subjects exceeds one-third of the total number of credits taken in that semester, the student should be ordered to repeat the grade. If it exceeds one-half, the student should be ordered to withdraw from school.

(5) The graduation test is changed to a comprehensive examination system. In addition to the final semester subjects, at least two (three for vocational schools and special courses) must contain the courses of the entire academic year, and the three or more major subjects previously studied in each grade must be passed. Those who fail are not allowed to graduate.

The aforementioned graduation test subjects must be reported to the Ministry for approval when reporting the graduating students.

(6) The graduation test committee and student graduation thesis (graduation thesis is not required for vocational schools and special courses) must be strictly implemented in accordance with the regulations of the university regulations and the revised vocational school regulations.

Starting from this semester, each school should strictly implement the above regulations and methods.

### This City: Overview of the Implementation of Public Education

Progress in Both Quality and Quantity, Enthusiastic Support from Various Schools

(Dahua News Agency) The implementation of compulsory education in this city began in the 24th year of the Republic [1935], but was once suspended due to the impact of the war following the July 7th Incident [Marco Polo Bridge Incident, 1937]. It was resumed from the first semester of the 26th year [1937], and has seen remarkable development in the past year. According to a spokesperson for the Compulsory Education Promotion Association of this city:

Adapting to Needs, Progressing Step by Step

Since the War of Resistance, Shanghai's education has relied on the effective guidance of the government authorities, the arduous support of educators, and the demands of the situation. It has not only avoided stagnation but has also made significant progress. Regarding compulsory education, due to the impact of the war, refugee children have gathered in Shanghai, the social economy is declining, and ordinary education expenses are beyond the means of impoverished families. Therefore, the need for compulsory education is more urgent than other forms of education. In order to help these distressed children and provide them with educational opportunities, the educational authorities have strived to restore compulsory education since the 26th year. Despite limited funding, they have steadily pushed forward, and today, a grand spectacle has emerged.

Advancing in Quality and Quantity, Optimistic About the Future

In terms of quantity, there are more than 330 classes in short-term primary schools for children's compulsory education, accommodating over 15,000 children. In terms of adult compulsory education, there are more than 30 public schools, accommodating around 1,300 adults. The number of personnel engaged in compulsory education work has reached nearly 400. Compared with the original pre-war undertakings, not only has it not decreased, but it has also increased by more than double. In terms of quality, concrete measures have been established for all aspects of administration, teaching, and guidance, and are implemented uniformly throughout the city. From this semester onwards, there are detailed plans for the standardization of curricula, the supply of teaching materials, the improvement of administrative management, and the promotion of inspections and guidance, with the aim of achieving the greatest effect with the least amount of funding. Looking ahead, the future is promising.

Acting Selflessly and Righteously, Enthusiastically Supporting

The achievements are due, on the one hand, to the comprehensive planning of the education authorities, and on the other hand, especially to the enthusiastic support of educators, with the latter being particularly significant. Because compulsory education funding is extremely limited, school buildings and equipment must be borrowed from existing schools. Fortunately, the authorities of various schools deeply understand the importance of promoting compulsory education and provide convenience in various ways. On average, each borrowed classroom only pays about six yuan per month for rent, water, and electricity. This spirit of public service and righteousness is not only admired by the association but also worthy of respect from all citizens of the city. Although a small number of schools have been unable to consider the financial difficulties of compulsory education and have not been able to provide convenience, the association is confident that this unfortunate phenomenon will soon disappear.

Life is Difficult, Improving Treatment

The lives of compulsory education personnel are extremely difficult. Their monthly income is often insufficient to maintain their own livelihood, let alone provide for their families. In this time of high prices, it is even more impossible to make ends meet. Fortunately, from this semester onwards, the funding per class has been slightly increased. The principal's salary is set at 28 yuan, and the teacher's salary is set at 24 yuan, with miscellaneous income (set at 40 cents per student per semester) allocated to cover office expenses. After this standard is raised, the average salary of teachers and staff can be increased by about 20%. Although it is a drop in the bucket, it is still a small supplement. It is hoped that all compulsory education personnel in the city will share the difficulties of the times, reduce material enjoyment, strive for spiritual comfort, and that the future of education will truly rely on them.

### Zhengfeng College of Arts Changes Name to Chengming College

The Zhengfeng College of Arts in this city originally had departments of Chinese Literature and Sinology. Since adding a Department of Commerce last summer and a Vocational Commerce course this summer, it has effectively become a college of both arts and commerce. The name and reality seem to be inconsistent. It is heard that the college submitted a request to the Ministry of Education during the summer vacation. It has now received a reply from Wu Junjun of the Ministry of Education, approving the name change to Chengming College.

### Food: Rice Market Speculation Shows Signs of Abating

The chaotic rice market showed some signs of clearing up yesterday, as the ban on shipping from Hong Kong and Vietnam was lifted, and large quantities of foreign rice arrived one after another. Shop sales were already above the price limit, and retail sales were difficult to promote, so there were few inquiries. Holders' thoughts became more relaxed as a result. Except for high-end foreign rice, there were calls for 66 to 67 yuan in the underground market, but there were no samples on offer. Other mid-range goods were mostly offered at the assessed price, but those manipulating the market were still unwilling to give up, and large households were still hoping for high prices to come. Therefore, the future market is prone to change with the slightest disturbance. Yesterday, as the exchange rate returned to Chang [Changjiang, Yangtze River], people's minds changed again, and some profitable bulls took the opportunity to exit. The market suddenly saw a strong selling trend, and the price fell lower and lower, suddenly dropping three or four yuan. After the price decreased slightly, there were inquiries taking advantage of the low price, and the market rebounded by about one yuan again. As a result, it was slightly lower than the previous day by two or three yuan, but still one or two yuan different from the publicly limited price. The only rice officially announced on the market was Zhongguan rice. Reclaimed original packaging of No. 2 Saigon rice, which was previously offered at 75 to 76 yuan, also fell to 73 to 74 yuan yesterday, and some medium-quality goods were officially sold at 71 yuan.

As for glutinous rice and japonica rice, the stock of broken millstones in the interior is dwindling. Yesterday, only 700 to 800 *dan* arrived. Although the reported dark market trading turned lackluster, the owners insisted, and the price remained at the original level, without any ups or downs. The prices quoted were all the same as before.

Still only 32 *dan* of Zhoupu goods arrived, and the selling price did not change, opening at 69.5 yuan to 69 yuan. Because porters heard of the soaring prices in Shanghai, they rushed to the market. The supply of new Taicang Yangjian rice brought by bicycle suddenly surged, to no less than 30 *shi*. However, the sales market suddenly turned dull due to the recovery of foreign rice. The porters, seeing that the new goods were soft and not easy to hold, had to loosen their grip, so the price depreciated by nearly one yuan. The original package opened at 63 to 64 yuan, and the price in *hu* was around 61 yuan.

### Bulls Take Profits and Exit, Japanese Flour Falls Slightly

Flour: Yesterday, the futures trading of Japanese factory flour, Phoenix brand, was still active, but the market had turned weak, and some bulls also exited. However, some customers still took advantage of the low prices to buy in, and the market did not fall much. The quoted price for Phoenix spot goods was 14.6 yuan, September 15 yuan to 14.9 yuan, and October 15.35 yuan. More than 5,000 bags were traded, all down one jiao to one jiao and a half from the previous day. Trading in inland flour and foreign flour was quiet. After the output of local factory flour decreased, the domestic sales demand was not weak, so the market was tight, with reclaimed goods being higher than the factory price by two or three jiao, which was different from the trend of Japanese factory flour.

Wheat: Yesterday's trading became quiet again, because very little goods arrived in the past few days, and even fewer were transported into the concession. After the export group once bought, they were still greedy for more, but unfortunately there were no goods to buy. The same was true for Chinese factories. However, Japanese factories still bought 3,000 to 4,000 bags of wheat from cars and ships at a price of 22 yuan to 21.5 yuan. It was also heard that the street Yuanfang bought 5,000 to 6,000 bags of Su-Xi wheat for 25.5 yuan. The market was once again in a situation where it was difficult to rise or fall.

### Oil Market: Road Goods of Raw Oil Arrive, Spot and Futures Oil Fall by One or Two Yuan, Soybean Oil Also Follows Slightly

Yesterday, the waves in the oil market had subsided, and the overall situation was downstream, because it was reported that more than 10,000 pieces of peanut oil road goods had been transported, which dampened people's spirits, the market atmosphere was loose, and futures oil fell by two yuan, with spot goods following by one yuan. Soybean oil also fell slightly. A total of 20 barrels of Dalian soybean oil were traded at a price of 100 yuan to 99.5 yuan, 30 barrels of Qingdao soybean oil at a price of 97 yuan, and 200 *dan* of Dayou factory soybean oil at a price of 76.5 yuan, and 100 barrels of Pudong factory soybean oil at a price of 76.5 yuan. 50 pieces of Jiaozhou spot peanut oil were traded at a price of 65 yuan, 200 pieces of September futures were traded at a price of 62.5 yuan to 62 yuan, 450 pieces of October futures were traded at a price of 63 yuan to 62.5 yuan, and 450 pieces of October futures were traded at a price of 63.5 yuan to 63 yuan.

### Finance: Large Selling Wind of Foreign Exchange, Subsides Only in the Afternoon

Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation, HSBC's listed prices did not rise or fall, and there was a continuous loose intention in the dark market of British and American exchange rates, because there were no new buyers. In the early morning, speculators dumped US dollars again, reaching 500,000 to 600,000 yuan, so it was almost as long as 5.375 yuan. Unexpectedly, HSBC and an American bank limited the absorption of a huge amount of US dollars at 5.375 yuan this month, and the large selling wind began to subside. The market situation was then cheaper, and finally it was 3 1/2 pence for British gold and 5.34375 yuan for US dollars, calculated as 0.03125 for the central bank and 0.0625 for the American bank. The transaction was prosperous.

The central government's listed exchange rates remained the same. The bank's morning opening price for spot goods was 3 1/4 pence for British gold and 5.25 yuan for US dollars, which was flat for British gold and tighter for US dollars by 0.03125 compared to the previous day's closing. After the opening, speculators first came to sell, and the potential was loose, calculated to be 5.25 to 5.375 yuan for the September US exchange rate dumped to foreign banks HSBC and American banks, and a Chinese bank sold the current shilling price for 3 1/2 pence. HSBC's listed price was announced and did not move, and the balance tax for silver was announced and did not increase or decrease. After that, Chinese merchant speculators turned to buy distant US exchange rates, and the price was still stable, calculated to be 5.3125 yuan for the October US exchange rate to foreign banks, and then 5.34375 and 2.28125 yuan for the current month's US exchange rate, because the intention to buy was strong, and the market turned tight again. Near noon, it hardened slightly, calculated to be 5.3125 yuan for the current month's US exchange rate settled by Chinese merchant speculators. The closing price was 3 484375 pence for British gold and 5.3125 yuan for US exchange rate, which was up 0.015625 for British exchange rate and hardened 0.0625 for US exchange rate compared to the morning opening.

HSBC Absorbs at Limited Price

In the afternoon, the market loosened again, and speculators tended to sell. Initially, the American bank absorbed 5.34375 yuan for the September US exchange rate, and later the American bank wanted to sell, but there were no opponents. Only HSBC at 5.375 yuan still had an appetite. The closing price was 3 1/2 pence for British gold and 5.34375 yuan for US exchange rate, and 3 484375 pence for October British gold and 5.3125 yuan for US exchange rate, which was up 0.03125 for the current price of British gold and down 0.0625 for US exchange rate compared to the closing price of the day before yesterday.

### Gold Market Continues to Fall

Although the dark market of spot gold in this city continued to fall and there were many transactions, because HSBC and American banks limited the absorption of US dollars at 5.375 yuan, the loose trend of foreign exchange had been blocked, and the price retreated to the 6,100 yuan mark, and then rebounded. People's minds in all directions turned uncertain again. About 5,000 taels were traded in total, and the price of jewelry gold fell by another 10 yuan, to 630 yuan, while the prices of customs gold, etc., were flat.

Spot Gold Decreases by 70 Yuan

Since the morning, the price of each bar (10 taels) was initially loose due to the loose exchange rate market, and people's spirits were scattered and weak. There were many sellers when the market opened, and it was pressed down by 85 yuan. The gold shop issued 30 taels to the silver shop, at 6,150 yuan. Then, relying on the gold shop and silver shop to take advantage of the low price, and retail investors also entered at this time, it soon rebounded by 60 yuan, and the silver shop did 50 taels, rising to 6,210 yuan. However, due to the loose foreign exchange market, money changers and a certain silver shop sold fiercely, and it fell sharply to 6,160 yuan. Later, as the foreign exchange market turned slightly, the spot gold shop suddenly came to pull it in, and it rose again to 6,205 yuan. Then, the foreign exchange market loosened again, the selling wind rose again, and the securities group and those who were unable to float sold first, and a certain gold shop still dumped, and the market was quite tired, and the price plummeted to a low of 6,105 yuan. At noon, the bulls finished their liquidation, and the securities group suddenly took advantage of the low price to cover their short positions, and the spot gold shop also followed up a lot, and the price rebounded to 6,175 yuan before the close, but the closing price was 6,160 yuan. The afternoon opening was quite good, the gold shop entered 10 taels to the silver shop, at 6,180 yuan, and then rose by more than 10 yuan. The money changer entered 20 taels to the gold shop, at 6,195 yuan. After that, the market suddenly turned down and tired, because the foreign exchange market loosened and the government bonds rose, which led to rumors of peace. The silver shop gang shorted with great force, and soon retreated to a low of 6,135 yuan. The securities gang came out to maintain after entering, and the closing price was still 6,165 yuan. As a result, it decreased by 70 yuan compared to the previous day, and the market situation outside the market was still weak. A small number of transactions were made at 6,150 yuan, with a fluctuation of 105 yuan throughout the day. The selling price of the spot gold shop's own brand of gold was slightly higher than that of spot gold, and the purchase price was reduced by 30 yuan. The spot gold was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there were few transactions.

Jewelry Gold is Reduced by Another 10 Yuan

At the beginning, the price of jewelry gold in silver shops was still 640 yuan per tael in Datonghang, but it was reduced by 10 yuan at 9:30 AM, and there were no changes after that. As a result, Datonghang changed to 630 yuan, and the new prices were the same as the above, with the purchase price reduced by 30 yuan.

### One Entry and Immediate Fall, No One Dares to Collect Japanese Notes

Yesterday's foreign currency market, spot gold continued to decline, and British and American gold pounds unanimously continued to fall by two yuan. The supply and demand of British gold notes and Hong Kong notes were still even, and the market price stood flat. The US gold notes continued to decline, and the evening market retreated to 18.54 yuan, which was down 0.26 yuan from the previous day. In addition, notes such as Singapore notes and Vietnamese notes, Robbie, Canada, and the Philippines all trended lower. The falling wind of Japanese gold notes became more intense, and almost no one dared to accept them, because one entry and immediate fall. The evening market retreated to 1.4 yuan, which was down 0.66 yuan from the previous day. Korean notes followed the decline, and the evening market retreated to 1.16 yuan.

### Securities: Domestic Bonds are Exchanged with Each Other

--Trust Shares Suddenly Rise Again--

Yesterday's stock market, the trend was increasingly tight, and the trading volume gradually decreased. Type B has broken through 58 yuan, Type E has broken through 4 yuan, and Type D has broken through 3 yuan, all seeing new highs again. The market price in the market is already high, and new transactions are gradually decreasing. Filling short positions is only a small number. Most of the entries and exits are exchange transactions. Comparing the market prices, Type A is cheaper, which has attracted many parties to exchange Type C for Type A, Type C for Type E, and some to exchange Type B for Type C, because Type B will be drawn soon, and the rising trend is gradually sufficient. The next lottery will be for Type C, so they are bought in advance. These are all a kind of calculation. There are not many shorts on the table, and the long positions are also limited. Yongkang Hengfu entered Type E and exited Type C, Lianhe entered Type C and exited Type B, and Hongda Jiufeng Tongfeng bought in from beginning to end. Defu Shunchang sold from beginning to end. Tiansheng Type E had some sales. As a result, the market price continued to rise by 0.3 to 0.65 yuan. The total transaction volume was about 1 million yuan. A simple table is listed below.

Stock trading, 300 shares of New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory were traded at a price of 22.75 yuan.

Yesterday's trading in the public stock market was mostly due to floating profits being settled and short positions being covered. By the time the bell rang at eleven o'clock, this hedging work seemed to have been completed, and the market situation began to harden. Those who usually specialize in waiting for opportunities to buy cheap at the weekend no longer had cheap stocks to buy at this point. Shanghai Silver Company progressed to 28.5 yuan, which was the most noteworthy rising trend of the whole morning. International Trust also soared from 21 yuan to 23 yuan. Wheelock, Yeguang, British Union, etc., were traded frequently. Rubber stocks made slight progress, and cheap stocks were absorbed very quickly.

### Yarn and Cotton: Sea Defense Line is Open, Cotton Yarn Sales Have Not Moved

The yarn market has entered another cycle of rotation, but most people expect the price to rise. All situations are uncertain, but the actual sales market is still seeping secretly as usual. However, it is rumored in the market that the sea defense shipping money can be restored to normal, so buyers are extremely active, but the customer help has no intention to help, and in addition, the exchange rate has returned, and gold has fallen sharply, so the yarn market has suddenly fallen.

Spot yarn opened early in the morning, because the mobs took the lead, and at around 9 o'clock, they advertised that the sea defense could be expected to pass through and load yarn, so they rushed in regardless of everything, and the price of 20-count Double Horse was 1,020 yuan, and suddenly rose to 30 yuan. Unexpectedly, the exchange rate opened out, and the price was released step by step, and gold fell sharply, and the selling wind was steep, so the market fell sharply to 1,011 yuan. After the closing, it rose again to 1,014 yuan. The statistics for half a day's trading were 3,430 bales, and the price of 60-count Double Horse was similar to the previous day.

Later, due to the partial head cover, the closing price was one pound higher than the previous day. The Indian market was closed, and it is predicted that the price will fall, called Robbie.

In the Shanghai port's foreign cotton trading, Huachang has been buying intensely in recent days, and has purchased tens of thousands of *dan* in the past three days, mostly long-fiber cotton, so the current inventory in the market has been greatly reduced. The thoughts of the industry are also becoming increasingly firm due to the sharp reduction in inventory. It is generally expected that the cotton market will continue to flourish.

Other items such as small-sized Gaoyou early red shrimp, arriving in the autumn season and being sufficiently dry, also continued to sell yesterday at a price of 260 yuan.

### Black Pepper Rises by Five Yuan

The black pepper trade has been quite active recently, and the market stock is gradually dwindling. Previously, high-quality black peppercorns and No. 1 peppercorns were priced at 107 yuan, but now they are selling at 112 yuan, an increase of 9 yuan compared to before. The market for white pepper is weak, and the price remains stable. Wendao goods are 200 yuan, and Dutch goods are 190 yuan.

### North-South Goods Golden Needles Showing Signs of Improvement

Previously, golden needles arrived in large quantities and sales were slow, causing market prices to drop by about 10 yuan. Now, with the resumption of demand from Hong Kong and the rise in the Hong Kong exchange rate, it is quite profitable. Therefore, the future market is expected to improve. Yesterday, the price of new, high-quality golden needles was 90 yuan to 85-86 yuan, and lower grades varied down to 70 yuan.

### Coal Hongji Small Coal Increases Steadily

Hongji small coal has been in short supply recently, and merchants are holding prices high. Depei No. 1 small coal has been offered at 226 yuan, an increase of 10 yuan compared to the previous week. Nanyang Kao small coal has also increased slightly, priced at 214 yuan per ton ex-truck. For local customers, Hongji No. 1 small coal is 12 yuan per load, and No. 2 is 11.5 yuan, delivered to customers, with external fees included.

### Medicinal Materials Newly Arrived Huaibei Cicada Sloughs

Recently, merchants transported more than ten packages of cicada sloughs from Huaibei via the Wan'an steamer. The quality is considered pure, and they have been stored in warehouses. Negotiations with merchants are underway, and a transaction is expected soon.

### Distinguishing Marks on Fractional Currency Notes

The Controversy Over Authenticity Concludes

Regarding the issue of counterfeit five-cent notes, after a certain news agency published the points for distinguishing them, which appeared in the local newspapers, this newspaper published the questionable points on the fifth, hoping that "the bank would make a clear statement so that people would know what to do." Yesterday, this newspaper saw a contribution from the Xin Sheng News Agency, stating that the Central Bank had made a clear statement that the counterfeit notes were under investigation. The controversy over authenticity seems to have come to an end.

However, this publication has also received three contributions, which are summarized below for the benefit of those using currency to have a more in-depth understanding.

Wang Lanxiang: Recently, a certain agency identified five-cent banknotes with different English wording as counterfeit. The Central Bank has now stated that they are all genuine banknotes and each has distinguishing marks. In addition to the "中" (zhong) character in the upper left corner, which is well known, there is also a hidden "一一五" (115) character at the roots of the trees on the right side. If you hold the two banknotes up to the light, the patterns match perfectly. The only difference is that the white space around the edges is slightly different in size. There is also the same "中" (zhong) character and "央" (yang) character on one-cent notes, which are often unnoticed. As for counterfeit notes, they have indeed been found on the market. The copper engravings are blurred, the paper is very poor, and there are no distinguishing marks.

Shen Lecai: The following points apply to genuine notes: (1) The English wording at the bottom of the reverse side of the first series is "Union Printing Co. U. S. A." Another banknote has "Union Publishers Printers Fed. Inc U.S.A." (2) The former is slightly darker in color than the latter, especially on the reverse side. (3) The numbers on the reverse side of the first series banknote are bold, and the spacing between the numbers is closer. Another banknote has thinner numbers and slightly wider spacing, with English letters on both ends, while the first series banknote only has English letters before the numbers. The above points are largely the same as the differences between genuine and counterfeit notes in the original text, but the facts are absolutely opposite.

Sun Xuan: The distinguishing marks on the five-cent and one-cent notes are marked, which is the same as what Mr. Wang Lanxiang said, but the positions are clearly pointed out. The "中" (zhong) character distinguishing mark on the five-cent note is on the 伍 (wu) character of the five cents in the lower right corner, under the root of the second tree. The "五" (wu) character is hidden in the upper corner of the 年 (nian) character of the twenty-eighth year, below the sixth tree on the right of the pagoda. The "中" (zhong) character distinguishing mark on the one-cent note is also at the roots of the first two trees on the left, and the "央" (yang) character is to the left of the twenty-eighth year, above the sharp corner of the palindrome, at the roots of the sixth tree on the right of the pagoda.

### Protracted Delay in Resolving Defense Zone Issue U.S. Prepares to Take Over Central District Important Decisions Reached in U.S. Authorities' Consultation Admiral Hart to Depart for Tianjin Today After Completing Business

According to foreign sources, Admiral Hart, commander of the U.S. Naval Asiatic Fleet, has been holding continuous talks with U.S. Acting Consul General Butler and Colonel Baker, commander of the Fourth Marines, in Shanghai for several days, and important decisions have already been made. Therefore, Hart is scheduled to leave Shanghai today aboard the U.S. cruiser Marblehead and return to Qingdao to be stationed. It is said that the ship came to Shanghai this time to transport supplies, and Hart took the opportunity to come to Shanghai to hear news about the defense zone issue in this area, which is currently being negotiated between the U.S. and Japan. As for Hart's flagship Augusta, it is expected to arrive in Shanghai in mid-September.

### U.S. Secretary of State Issues Statement

United Press Washington, 5th. U.S. Secretary of State Hull stated yesterday that the A Zone in Shanghai, the location of the U.S. Consulate General and other important American property, is one of the reasons why the U.S. is determined to oppose the Japanese occupation of the British defense zone in Shanghai. The original text of Hull's statement is as follows: "On August 15, at a meeting held in response to a notice from the British side that British troops would withdraw from Shanghai, the Shanghai Defense Force Committee voted to transfer the D Zone of the Public Concession defense zone to the Japanese army and the A Zone to the U.S. defense forces. This decision was made by a majority vote, with the Japanese commander voting against it. This majority vote was later endorsed by the Shanghai Municipal Council. The U.S. government, with the A Zone being the location of the U.S. Consul General and a large number of important American interests, and also because the area is located between the current location of U.S. warships and the usual mooring location of U.S. warships, also approved this vote and notified the Japanese government of its approval. Due to Japan's protests, neither the D Zone nor the A Zone have been taken over by the defense forces. (According to Shanghai newspapers last night, the Japanese seem to have occupied the D Zone without formally notifying U.S. officials and have implemented patrols throughout the area.) The defense of the A Zone is temporarily handled by the Shanghai Volunteer Corps through an agreement. Because this matter is very important, the U.S. and Japanese governments are currently conducting discussions and are focusing on the A Zone. The U.S. government hopes to reach a reasonable solution immediately that takes into account all interests and allows the U.S. defense forces to assume responsibility for the A Zone."

### Expression Made by Tokyo

Reuters, Tokyo, 6th. Foreign Ministry spokesman Suma said today regarding the Shanghai Public Concession defense zone issue that he believed the U.S. now clearly wants to resolve the issue once and for all. The U.S. government seems very concerned about Shanghai affairs, but we believe this is not very important. The spokesman implicitly indicated that the U.S. is now urging Japan to accept certain conditions not included in the current temporary arrangements. He continued that the Japanese and U.S. authorities in Shanghai are familiar with all aspects of the issue, so it is appropriate to deal with it. We hope they can find a practical solution and reach a resolution. The spokesman did not want to disclose whether the Japanese government had received a note from the U.S. government regarding the issue or whether the two governments had begun negotiations as a result. However, he acknowledged that someone had suggested that such a major event should be handled by the governments in Tokyo or Washington.

Continued Discussion of Defense Zone Issue Yesterday

Yesterday was the 41st anniversary of the signing of the "Open Door" treaty by the great powers and China. Admiral Hart, commander of the U.S. Naval Asiatic Fleet, continued to discuss various issues related to Shanghai with U.S. Acting Consul General Butler in the morning for several hours. No statements were issued regarding the content of the talks, but it is understood that the two discussed nothing more than the current situation, such as the defense zone issue. Well-informed sources in the area stated yesterday that no drastic action would be taken regarding the current situation in Shanghai before the door to negotiations is closed.

U.S. Side Prepares to Take Over A Zone

It is generally speculated that if the defense zone issue cannot be satisfactorily resolved in the near future, then the U.S. Naval Fourth Marine Regiment in this area will have no choice but to take over the A Zone, because it is practically impossible for the Shanghai Volunteer Corps to permanently garrison the area. It is generally pointed out that the members of the corps currently stationed in the "A" Zone are all serving on leave from their normal jobs, causing many inconveniences for the agencies they serve.

Defense Adjustments in Northern A Zone

Since the Shanghai Volunteer Corps temporarily took over the defense zone left by the British troops in the Public Concession, the Concession authorities have successively convened British and American troops, and have begun to rotate the defense of the B Zone. A half-squadron of White Russian troops has been temporarily stationed in the D Zone. However, rumors of the Volunteer Corps taking over defense are extremely inaccurate. A reporter from the Pingming News Agency learned yesterday from Chinese and foreign officers of the Volunteer Corps that the Volunteer Corps Headquarters, in view of the "September 18th" anniversary, believed that the Volunteer Corps might need to be fully convened for defense. Therefore, the defense of the northern B Zone was adjusted yesterday by General Commander Hembly of the Volunteer Corps. Because the American B-Company will be fully deployed on the "September 18th" anniversary, there are now new regulations for the defense of the northern B Zone. The A-Company, currently defending the northern B Zone, will rest on the 11th. From the 11th to the 15th, the British Light Horse will take over the defense. From the 15th to the 26th, the A-Company will resume the defense.

### Senior Police Officer Yao Ke Attacked Yesterday But Unharmed Yao Bravely Returned Fire, Repelling the Thugs Japanese Military Police Apprehended One Person at the Scene

A major shooting incident occurred at the entrance of Lane 749, Yuyuan Road, Shanghai, at approximately 9:10 a.m. yesterday. Two thugs attempted to harm Yao Ke (R.W. Yorke), a British deputy director of the Political Department of the Shanghai Municipal Police. Fortunately, Yao was alert and quickly dodged while drawing his gun to return fire. Many shots were fired by both sides, but none hit. The thugs eventually fled into the crowd. One of the bandits was apprehended by the Japanese Military Police. However, Yao's car, license plate number 8474, had multiple holes in the fenders. The details are as follows:

Brave and Capable Officer with Years of Service

Yao Ke, a British deputy director of the Political Department of the Shanghai Municipal Police, is 48 years old and has served in the police for 27 years. He is capable and brave, and therefore deeply valued by his superiors. His home is located in a Western-style house at No. 7, Lane 749, Yuyuan Road, Shanghai. At approximately 9:10 a.m. yesterday, Yao left his residence, wearing a Western-style suit, to go to the police station to handle official business as usual. He was riding in his own car with the Concession license plate number 8474, driven by a Mr. Wang, number five from the Shanghai Municipal Police.

Thugs Ambush and Open Fire

As Yao stepped into the car, the driver started the engine and drove forward. Just as they exited the lane entrance, two thugs, approximately 30 years old and wearing white flannel suits, who had been lying in wait there, saw Yao's car drive out. They both drew new Mauser pistols and opened fire on Yao's car, firing more than ten shots in rapid succession. Two bullets hit the left car door, one hitting the door seam, and another penetrating the left fender. At that time, Yao remained calm, drew his official pistol from the car, and returned fire, firing seven shots. A fierce shootout ensued.

Exchanged Fire, No Casualties

Bullets flew in all directions, and the sound was like firecrackers. Pedestrians scrambled for cover. However, neither side was hit. The thugs, seeing that the situation was not good, fled with their weapons. One bandit was later apprehended by the Japanese Military Police and taken to headquarters for investigation. Subsequently, the Jing'an Temple police station heard the alarm and quickly dispatched a large number of Chinese and Western detectives to pursue them. However, the bandits were gone. Multiple bullet casings were recovered from the scene and taken back to the police station for research. Afterwards, the Shanghai Municipal authorities attached great importance to the case and ordered the police to conduct a thorough investigation.

Yao Ke Describes the Encounter

Yao Ke described his ordeal to a reporter from the English-language Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury as follows: As I (Yao Ke referring to himself) was leaving the lane in the car, I saw two Orientals ahead. When the car reached them, about five to seven yards away, I suddenly saw one of them reach into his pocket. I immediately grabbed the pistol from the seat cushion beside me. The man raised his gun and fired. I also decided to return fire. Another person went around to the back of the car and fired. The driver continued to drive the car out of the street. The person who fired in front of the car ran out of the lane and west along Yuyuan Road towards Zhaofeng Park. He was stopped by a Japanese Military Police officer within twenty yards, who seized his pistol and took him away. The other person disappeared. There were no other pedestrians in the lane during the shooting. I ran out of bullets in my pistol and did not carry any extra ammunition. So, after the incident, I went to the Jing'an Temple police station to report it and then continued to work. Both assailants were wearing clean white flannel suits and were about 30 years old.

Condolences and Congratulations on Escaping Danger from All Sides

According to an inspection of Yao Ke's car, license plate number 8474, there were three bullet holes. One penetrated the left mudguard, and the other two were on the left rear door. Yao Ke was sitting in the left rear seat when he was attacked. One bullet penetrated the rear door and entered the seat cushion, approximately three inches from Yao Ke. Yesterday morning, Yao Ke received phone calls from all sides offering condolences and congratulating him on his narrow escape. Yao Ke has served in the police for over 27 years and enjoys a good reputation. He previously managed the "A" police district. About three years ago, he was transferred to head the special section. He is originally from Nottingham, England, and is 48 years old. He came to Shanghai approximately 30 years ago.

### Japanese Emperor's Cousin Killed in Action in Inner Mongolia

The China Press reported, citing a Tokyo dispatch from the Domei News Agency on the 5th, that the Japanese Ministry of the Army officially announced that the Japanese Emperor's cousin, Prince Kitashirakawa, age 30, with the rank of artillery captain, came to China this spring and served as a staff officer with the army. On the 4th of this month, while conducting a combat mission by plane in a certain area of Inner Mongolia, the plane crashed and he was killed in action.

### The Jiangding Steamer Still Has No Hope of Release

The Jiangding Steamer of the German firm Reiher & Co. was seized by the Japanese on the morning of the 4th and moved to Gaochangmiao. It has been the fourth day and there is still no result to negotiations. The release is still hopeless. Passengers and cargo are very anxious. The reason for the seizure remains unknown.

### British Steamers Scheduled to Sail to Fangcheng, Jiangsu, Guizhou, and Minsheng Each Ship's Sailing Schedule Has Been Assigned

The official resumption of the Shanghai-Vietnam route was reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now learned that the Taikoo and Jardine Matheson shipping companies have assigned ships to sail to Fangcheng. The Jiangsu Steamer has also been confirmed to sail from Shanghai to Fangcheng on the 8th. The Guizhou Steamer was originally scheduled to depart on the same day (the 8th) as the Jiangsu Steamer, sailing to Xiamen, Shantou, Hong Kong, and Siam. It is now also ordered to call at Saigon. Jardine Matheson has assigned the Minsheng Steamer to be the first to resume service next Wednesday (the 11th), sailing from Shanghai to Haiphong. The steamer is currently en route from Hong Kong to Shanghai and is expected to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow. Guangzhouwan is still in port. As for the source of foreign rice, it has not been interrupted during the suspension of service. Now that the Shanghai-Vietnam route is open, it can come in a steady stream, and rice prices should be suppressed.

### Rice Merchants Unanimously Advocate That Rice Prices Should Not Be Raised Citizens Hope Authorities Will Lower Prices Quickly Arrested Rice Profiteers Interrogated One by One

The Rice and Grain Valuation Committee convened a standing committee meeting at 3:00 p.m. yesterday. Representatives from the French Concession Public Works Bureau and the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce attended to supervise. All committee members were present. First, the chairman reported the purpose of the meeting. Then, Zhang Lizhong of the Market Management Committee reported on the buying and selling situation of the same industry in the market. Afterwards, Qu Zhenhua, a representative of the Rice Merchants Association, repeatedly advocated that rice prices should not be raised again and suggested that the black market in the market should be severely cracked down. The committee members expressed their opinions, and the situation was quite tense. The general idea was: (1) No. 1 foreign rice is no longer seen in the market. (2) It is hoped that the original price limit will be maintained. (3) In the future, rice and grain transactions must invite representatives from the two Concession authorities and the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce to sign the contract together. (4) To maintain the original price limit, the two authorities and the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce should be asked to provide effective assistance.

Maintain Valuation

The committee's valuation result yesterday was to maintain the maximum price set on the 3rd of this month, and it will be publicly announced to the market this morning for strict enforcement. "For the purpose of public announcement, this committee convened a standing committee meeting on the 6th of this month to discuss the market price of foreign rice. It was resolved to uphold the intentions of the two Concession authorities and resolutely maintain the price set on the 3rd of this month. The market is hereby publicly announced to strictly comply, and black market and other matters are strictly prevented. If there are any deliberate violations, anyone can report them, and the authorities will be asked to severely punish them. In addition to reporting to the two Concession authorities, it is appropriate to record the instructions and hope that everyone will be fully aware of them. This is hereby announced. Attached is the price set on September 3, which is: No. 1 Saigon Siam 61.5 yuan, Firemark 61 yuan, No. 2 Saigon Siam 59 yuan, Small Mill 58.5 yuan, Gao Dongjing Usu Rice 56 yuan, Dongjing Brown Rice 52 yuan, Millet Green 50 yuan, Mixed Broken 46 yuan."

Sudden Reversal

Shipping between Shanghai and Haiphong was restored the day before yesterday, and various shipping companies have also begun to dispatch ships. Since the news was published in the newspapers, speculative rice merchants have been caught off guard. They all believe that with the resumption of shipping between Shanghai and Haiphong, the source of rice and grain can continue to arrive, and people's hearts are unanimously weakening. Large households are lowering prices to sell off. After the rice store tea party market opened in the morning, the initial market showed weakness. Spot goods flooded the market, and supply exceeded demand, with a sharp drop of about three or four yuan. It is self-evident that rice profiteers deliberately exceeded the price limit in the previous few days. The day before yesterday, the Tongcheng Company on Jiangxi Road transported 16,000 bags of foreign rice from Saigon, which were unloaded and entered the warehouse yesterday. In addition, 32,000 bags of Saigon foreign rice will arrive today. Therefore, the rice reserves in this city will become more and more abundant, and there is no risk of shortage of the entire people's food.

Arrested Rice Profiteers

Due to the manipulation of a large amount of rice by speculators, the market situation of Japanese rice and grain has caused rice prices to rise frequently. The police authorities of the two Concessions have increased staff and stationed them in the market to monitor the buying and selling of each company. The day before yesterday morning, a rice profiteer, Chen Rongshan, the manager of the Yitai Rice Store on Zhejiang Road, purchased a certain amount of No. 2 Siam foreign rice from the Jufeng Rice Store in the Zhonghui Building (its agent is Mao Jian-sui). The transaction price was 61.7 yuan per stone (the price limit is 59 yuan), and the transaction was brokered by Mo Jinting. Tao Zhonggao, an agent of the Yuanhecheng on Dongxin Bridge, reported to the resident police detective on the spot and he was taken to the Central Police Station. After separate interrogations, it was rumored that he was released at 5:00 p.m. that afternoon, which is probably not true. It is believed that the authorities will not let him go so easily.

Suspension of Low-Price Rice Sales

The Shanghai Low-Price Rice Sales Committee decided at its 15th standing committee meeting to temporarily suspend the fourth phase of low-price broken rice sales from tomorrow. As for the fifth phase of low-price sales, it will continue and is scheduled to begin on the 19th of this month. 60,000 bags of broken rice will be sold, all of which have been shipped from Yuncheng, the place of origin. After this phase is completed, there will still be more than 56,000 bags, enough for two months of low-price sales. However, after this batch of foreign rice is sold out, the committee will temporarily come to an end and handle the closing affairs.

Supply Is Not Scarce

The Continental Daily reported that an official of the French Concession Public Works Bureau told reporters yesterday (the 5th) that the efforts of the Shanghai Municipal Council and the "City Government" to jointly adjust the supply and price of food for the people in the Shanghai area have achieved satisfactory results. The official believes that the current supply of rice and grain is as good as ever, and Shanghai can now obtain a large supply of Saigon rice. Before the European War, France purchased approximately 800,000 tons of rice from Vietnam annually. Now, due to the lack of ships, the rice and grain cannot be shipped to Europe and must find other sales channels in the Far East. The French Concession has sufficient stocks of rice, flour, and other important foods.

No Need to Panic

Therefore, there is no reason for residents to fear a food shortage due to the rising prices of rice and flour. The French Concession Price Equalization Committee, established on March 1, aims to curb manipulation and hoarding and arbitrary price increases by retailers and wholesalers, and to assist merchants in replenishing stocks at any time. In order to make price control effective, the Price Equalization Committee has obtained the cooperation of the administrative authorities of the adjacent districts to benefit residents. Since the establishment of the Price Equalization Committee, it has met once a week, and representatives from the Shanghai Municipal Council Food Subcommittee also attend.

### Saviour Church Holds Dedication Service for Sanctuary

The Shanghai Saviour Church of the Chinese Anglican Church has been rebuilt on Zhao Bishop Road for more than a year. The style is modern and grand, and the cost is considerable. It is the only great cathedral among the churches at sea, capable of accommodating more than a thousand believers. Therefore, the sanctuary of the church was not completed until last month. At the board meeting in August, it was decided that the dedication service for the sanctuary would be held at 10:00 a.m. on the 8th of this month. The chairman of the Advisory Committee of the Diocese, the Reverend Bu Fangji, will be invited to preach, and there will be a choir, accompanied by special anthems. Those who wish to listen to Reverend Bu's sermon and music are welcome to come to the church.

### French Consul General Ouin to Go to Australia in Mid-September Duties Temporarily Assumed by Consul Douvier Successor Not Appointed by Government

The English-language Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury reported that it was recently learned that French Consul General Ouin, stationed in Shanghai, will leave Shanghai in mid-September to take up a new position in Australia. This matter has not yet been officially announced, but it is heard that Ouin will soon receive instructions from the French government. French Consul Douvier, stationed in Shanghai, has been appointed to temporarily take charge of the affairs of the French Consulate here, pending the arrival of Ouin's successor. However, the successor has not yet been appointed by the Vichy government. Ouin has been serving as Consul General in Shanghai since 1937, together with Baux de la Pagerie. About five months ago, Baux left Shanghai, and Ouin has been fully responsible since then. Ouin was born in France on February 26, 1895. He joined the French Army during World War I and performed meritorious service, earning a military medal. In 1920, he worked for the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and then served as French Consul in Shantou and Vancouver, before being transferred to Shanghai.

### Commemoration of the Father of the Nation's Uprising

September 9 is the anniversary of the first uprising of Sun Yat-sen, the Father of the Nation. In order to emulate the revolutionary spirit of the Father of the Nation and complete the great task of resisting construction, all sectors of the city will unanimously observe a moment of silence at that time, but no commemorative ceremony will be held. All sectors will also intensify efforts to raise winter clothing donations, as the winter season is approaching and soldiers and refugees are in urgent need of warm clothing. In accordance with the central government's regulations, the anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's London ordeal on October 11 and the anniversary of the Guangzhou ordeal on June 16 will be combined and held on that day.

### Pacific Hurricane Passes Okinawa, Threatens Shanghai

After a Pacific hurricane left Shanghai and moved out to sea, dissipating over the Sea of Japan, a second hurricane has appeared. According to a report from the Xujiahui Observatory at 6:00 a.m. yesterday, it has reached 23 degrees north latitude and 130 degrees east longitude, heading northwest by west, with the center within 60 nautical miles. According to the above report, the hurricane has reached the sea southeast of Okinawa and is gradually approaching the Chinese coast. If the direction remains unchanged, the threat to Shanghai from the hurricane will increase. Therefore, the Jianghai Customs and the Observatory have been paying attention to its development. According to another report from the Observatory, another hurricane has risen in the Pacific, currently located at 24 degrees north latitude and 145.3 degrees east longitude, with the center within 120 nautical miles, heading northwest. The trend is still unclear.

### 安立德臨別廣播　默禱中國復興　並向在華友人表示惜別　安氏子女均仍留居上海

Retiring Commercial Counselor An Litede, before his departure from Shanghai, gave a ten-minute broadcast at XMHO radio station at 12:30 noon yesterday to bid farewell to people here. His speech stated, "Many of my friends in China regret the separation of my wife and me. For example, Dr. Bu Fangji, who has been in China for 54 years, believes that leaving before him is equivalent to abandoning the journey halfway. However, I am comforted by the fact that my task has been handed over to capable successors, and that half of my family remains in China, namely two sons and one daughter, who still wish to reside here. They possess the optimistic spirit of their parents."

"Their unwillingness to return to the country with my wife and me is not forced. My wife and I plan to settle in Mill Valley or Berkeley in the San Francisco Bay Area. Many Americans who have lived in China for a long time choose to reside in California after returning to their country, where talent and culture gather. They have almost pioneered an area as a residence for those who have returned to America after living in China. In the past thirty-eight years, I have strived to introduce China to the United States." "Now, as my wife and I prepare to retire and return home, I would like to take this opportunity to first thank my Chinese, American, and other friends who have bid farewell to my wife and me in recent days. I am deeply grateful for the banquets and hospitality you have provided. Secondly, I bid farewell to my countless friends, especially those in mainland China today. Due to the situation, my wife and I cannot bid farewell in person, which is deeply regrettable. My wife and I hope that your future is bright, and we silently pray for the day of China's revival, which is not far away." After Mr. and Mrs. An finished the broadcast, they boarded the Dutch postal ship "Zhishalianjia" at 2 PM, leaving Shanghai for Hong Kong, waiting to take the Pan American Clipper to the United States.

### 法政府盼法僑　繼續輪將

The Shanghai branch of the French War Wounded Relief Committee will remit the collected donations, totaling US$23,750 and 500,560 French francs, to Vichy in three batches for the purpose of relieving wounded soldiers. The French government has received the full amount and has instructed the French Ambassador to China, Mr. Gosem, to express gratitude to the French expatriates and people from all walks of life in China and abroad, stating that France is currently full of devastation and in urgent need of relief, and hoping that the French expatriates in China will continue to provide support to alleviate the difficulties.

### 德義未派代表　前往越南　德大使館聲明

Haitong News Agency Special Dispatch from this city: It was reported in the Chinese and foreign newspapers in this city a few days ago that delegations from Germany and Italy were traveling to Vietnam via Kunming to investigate the economic situation there. The German Embassy in China hereby authorizes Haitong News Agency to declare that the said rumor is completely unfounded.

### 美紅會將在滬　設立分辦事處

The Continental Daily reported that, according to the current issue of the Miller's Review, the work of the American Red Cross in Shanghai was previously carried out through the American Advisory Committee of this city. In April of this year, the Advisory Committee ceased operations, and the work of the American Red Cross in Shanghai also came to a halt. According to a telegram received from Washington last week, the American Red Cross will soon establish a branch office in this city to resume its services.

### 投機日人　將按軍法嚴辦

Japanese Military Police Sternly Warn

The English-language "Great American Evening Post" reported that, according to the Japanese "Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun," a spokesperson for the Shanghai Japanese Military Police stated that Japanese residents in Shanghai found to be engaged in exchange rate speculation will henceforth be severely punished according to military law. Many Japanese are unworthy of the name of Japanese. Those who have recently come to Shanghai from Japan are only interested in profit and engage in exchange rate speculation, daring to act contrary to the policies of the Japanese government. It is hoped that Japanese residents in Shanghai will understand the intentions of the authorities and abide by national policies.

### 搜查王正廷住宅後　陳維儉突被捕　陳現任浙三區督察專員

As reported in yesterday's newspaper, Japanese personnel suddenly joined members of the French Concession Police Department in searching Wang Zhengting's residence at 50 Guba Road in the early morning of the day before yesterday. It has now been learned that after a lengthy search of the premises, in addition to the seizure of several letters, a man dressed in Chinese attire was arrested, identified as a Mr. Li. They then went to 178 Henry Road and arrested a thin man. It was later learned that the man's name was Chen Weijian, from Pinghu, who previously served as the Inspector General of the Zhejiang Provincial Police Department and is reportedly currently the Administrative Inspector of the Third District of Zhejiang.

### 確保市民安甯秩序　戒備益趨嚴密　防止意外事件遏滅暴行　兩租界邊區昨加緊搜查

In order to ensure the peace and order of the citizens, the police authorities of the two concessions have taken strict precautions. According to a senior official of the police department, the purpose of these precautionary measures is only to prevent the occurrence of unexpected events and to ensure the good order within the territory. Various rumors are purely groundless. In the Public Concession, in view of the effective security measures taken before and after the "August 13th" incident, the precautions have been extended. The French Concession has implemented special precautions since 11 PM on the 3rd, also because the results have been excellent, so it will continue to maintain security within the territory.

Divided Entry and Exit

Since the French Concession police authorities implemented precautions from 11 PM on the 3rd, the barbed wire frames placed on the roads adjacent to Avenue Edward VII have not been removed as of yesterday. Only the gaps left on the Bund, Tianzhutang Street, Dongxinqiao, Min Ti Ni Yin Road, Shengmuyuan Road, Avenue Albert, and Haige Road have been reinforced with iron carts and armed Chinese and Western detectives stationed there. Yesterday, ropes were also added nearby, and pedestrians entered and exited in separate lanes, with excellent order. The detectives at each location inspected vehicles and pedestrians entering and exiting very carefully. The patrol teams within the concession were also very active, and shops in the alleys were still being inspected. Armored police vehicles also patrolled all day without letting up.

Checking Permits

The Public Concession is still continuing the precautions implemented since the 9th of last month. Barbed wire frames are still placed on the roads leading to the French Concession and the bridges over the Suzhou Creek, and detectives are stationed there. The barbed wire can be set up and blocked at any time when necessary.

### 救世軍冬令計劃　辦庇寒所　收容乞丐一二千名

The leader of the Salvation Army in this city, Maurice, returned to Shanghai from Qingdao on the 5th of this month after completing his summer vacation. A reporter from the Pingming News Agency visited Mr. Mao yesterday to inquire about relief work. He said that with the price of rice soaring to about 70 yuan per picul, it is really difficult for the poor to make a living. The Salvation Army is stepping up its rice distribution work and has allocated 2,000 yuan for rice distribution expenses this month. At the same time, he hoped that rice merchants would try their best to suppress rice prices and show compassion for the poor. He also said that as autumn is approaching and severe winter is coming soon, he has already planned to set up a beggar shelter, planning to accommodate 1,000 to 2,000 beggars. The location has not yet been determined. As for the street tea carts that were established this summer, they will be canceled due to the cooler weather. However, in the cold autumn weather, there is still a need for ordinary laborers to quench their thirst after work, so the tea distribution item has been decided to continue.

### 出租房屋　被控詐財　審訉終結侯判

Ye Shuyuan, a 26-year-old native of Pudong, residing at No. 43, Jijiagang Lane, Youyifang, No. 410 Jin Shenfu Road, recently entrusted lawyer Jin Yu to file a complaint with the Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court, accusing Tang Xipin (37 years old) and Tang Guansan (62 years old), a father and son living at No. 69 Jinyeli, Laoshenfu Road, of jointly conspiring to defraud him of property. It is alleged that the plaintiff, seeing that order in the city was gradually restored and the market was turning around, learned that a building at No. 17 Guanyinge Street in the South City belonged to the defendants and immediately rented it from the first defendant. It is claimed that someone else had already reserved the house and that he had to find a way to "dig out" the tenant. The plaintiff believed it to be true and immediately paid a "dig out" deposit of 300 yuan, for which the first defendant issued a receipt, stating that if the lease was not concluded in the future, the original amount would be returned. At the time of payment and receipt, the second defendant, the father of the first defendant, was also present to discuss the matter and did not express any objections. Unexpectedly, when the plaintiff later went to formally rent the house, the first defendant claimed that he had no right to dispose of it, and when the plaintiff reasoned with him, he flatly refused to admit it and made excuses, avoiding meeting him. The defendants' behavior clearly showed a joint conspiracy to defraud him of property, committing a crime under Article 339 of the Criminal Law, and he is also filing a civil suit to recover the deposit of 300 yuan. The court, based on the complaint, held a trial yesterday by Judge Tang. The defendants admitted issuing the receipt, but denied actually receiving the plaintiff's deposit. After verifying the statements in court and questioning both parties in detail, the court, finding that the facts were clear, ordered closing arguments, declared the trial concluded, and scheduled a date for the verdict. It is noted that the second defendant, Tang Guansan, was also accused of illegal occupation of rent before summer and was convicted in the Second Special District Court and fined 500 yuan. The appeal is still pending.

### 丈夫患神經病　妻訴離婚　雙方同意和解

Liu Huizhi, a giant in the banking industry, has a son named Liu Zikang, who has been married to Zhou Shiru, the daughter of Zhou Wuchang, the head of the Zhou Zishan family, for more than ten years. The couple's feelings were quite harmonious at first, and they have three children. In recent years, there has been discord between the two sexes, and there have been times of conflict. Recently, Zhou Shiru entrusted a lawyer to file a complaint with the Civil Court of the First Special District Court, requesting a divorce from her husband, Liu Zikang. The reason stated that the defendant, Liu Zikang, has suffered from mental illness in recent years and has been treated by both Chinese and Western doctors, but there is no hope of recovery. Although the plaintiff is now a middle-aged woman, the defendant's illness has no hope of recovery, which has a significant impact on the plaintiff's happiness. Therefore, she has no choice but to sue for divorce. The case was summoned yesterday by Judge Tao. The defendant, Liu Zikang, was unable to appear in court in Wuhu. His father, Liu Huizhi, entrusted lawyer Shan Yuhua to appear in court, stating the reason why the defendant, Liu Zikang, was unable to appear in court and submitting two handwritten letters written by Liu Zikang as evidence. The plaintiff, Zhou Shiru's lawyer, said that the defendant's incurable disease made it unlikely that he could write letters. The court, considering that the case involved a marital dispute, earnestly persuaded both parties to reconcile. The defendant's side stated that paintings and antiques worth tens of thousands of yuan were all in the plaintiff's possession, and the two sides had a major dispute over this issue. However, both parties agreed to go outside to conduct a reconciliation. The court immediately ordered the case to be rescheduled for further hearing.

The landlord of Continental Fang on Luban Road in the French Concession recently entrusted Zhu Yisheng Law Firm's Management Department to send a letter to all tenants, stating that from October of this year, the rent will be increased by 50% across the board based on the original rent amount. After receiving the notice, the tenants of the building all stated that the rent there had already been increased once at the request of the landlord after August 13th, and it has not been long since then. Now, they want to increase the rent by as much as 50% on the pretext, which is actually unbearable. Therefore, they unanimously expressed resistance and will deal with it according to the law.

### 拐失小孩家屬　投捕房認明照片　俾電鼓浪嶼工部局　飭派探員送孩來滬

In early last month, Zhang Decai, a detective at the Public Concession General Inspectorate, arrested five men and women, including Chen Zhangshi, who were involved in child trafficking, at 21 Yichengfang, Yuezhou Road, and 2 Zhenzhuchang Road, Xujiahui, based on reports. Subsequently, based on their confessions, he went to Gulangyu with Japanese detective Nakamura Hideo to request assistance from the local police station, arresting four principal offenders, including Su Desan. He also found sixteen boys who had been sold. In order to facilitate matters, the police authorities took photos of all the boys and girls and gave them to Detective Zhang to bring to Shanghai for identification by the families of the missing children. The children are still temporarily being raised by the buyers. Once a family identifies a photo, the Central Police Station will telegraph the Gulangyu Municipal Council to send officers to escort them to Shanghai. It is hoped that the families of the missing children will go to Room 307, 3rd Floor, Central Police Station, Fourth Horse Road, between 9 and 12 AM and 2 and 4 PM every day to contact Detective Zhang to identify the photos.

### Joke About a Chicken Wedding

I have heard that in the customs of Hubei Province there is a saying of marrying a donkey as a wife, that is, people marry a female donkey ten or a few days before marrying a wife. The method is to wash the female donkey clean, put a red felt on the donkey's body, and pin a golden flower on the donkey's head. The groom, wearing his clothes and hat, kowtows to heaven, earth, ancestors, and ancestors. He enters the bridal chamber at night, and the donkey is tied in the room. The groom lies on the bed. From then on, the family members regard the donkey as the young mistress and never whip or tame it. Now I hear that there is a chicken wedding in Lingnan, which is really true. In the remote rural areas of Fanshun Township in Lingnan, there are people who go abroad to trade after betrothing a wife but before marrying; by the time they grow up, the husband has not yet returned, so there is a chicken wedding ceremony. The method is to choose a rooster, and on an auspicious day, lead the bride to kowtow to it, just like the donkey wife in Hubei, and the bride then lives in the husband's house to serve her in-laws. Last month, a certain He in a rural village in Panyu had a son who was engaged to a certain Mo in the village, who was sixteen years old. He followed people to trade in Singapore, and has not returned for five years. The woman is already old, and the father followed the custom and performed the chicken wedding. On the auspicious day, the bride was carried in a sedan chair. The family members then led the chicken in a cage to kowtow. Unexpectedly, the chicken fell over when touched, because the clucking chicken had already gone to the underworld. For a time, the family members and guests did not know what to do, so they abandoned the chicken and simply performed the ceremony with only the bride. At this time, old women and others spread rumors, saying that the groom was abroad and that something unlucky might happen. Looking at the scene, there are those who cannot help but burst into laughter! As the saying goes, "Marry a chicken and follow the chicken," that's what it means.

### Death

— Liu Kui

The son of the woman in the kitchen downstairs died. That child, who was just able to jump, laugh, and was five or six years old.

I went downstairs and saw a piece of cloth lying horizontally on the ground inside, with bright colors; if there were no women wailing in grief, screaming, and raising their disheveled hair, tearing their faces with tears like a whip, perhaps someone would think it was a quilt that had accidentally fallen.

People were silently half-surrounding the doorway, quietly.

Outside the street, a dark mass was looking around; I saw a few of this child's playmates, staring with big black eyes, as if a little horrified by this sorrowful screaming.

Soon, the distraught father rushed in from the door, this worker threw his straw hat back, pulled open his already unbuttoned shirt, revealing his strong chest. Looking at his crazy wife and the child on the ground, he bent down to lift the cloth, but raised his hand again at the touch of it. The corners of his mouth, in the public's gaze, strangely wrinkled, as if he had drunk a bitter wine.

……

Death, what a big deal is it here?

Apart from the beggars who freeze and starve to death, almost every season there are three or five bluish-purple dead infants thrown on the side of the road in the alley.

However, the person who hugged the dead child is starting to wrap their body with burning incense sticks. Waving like someone using the fire stick of a magic act, and also chanting something, like a spell, fearing that death has a little bit of love for her. ……

In fact, what is death really?

The children ran away and went to play. A mother holding a baby, although her face turned green at the time, softly sang a lullaby when she reached the entrance of the alley.

For the dead child, it can also be regarded as being spared a hardship. He is eternally at rest, spared the bullying given to him by many decent children on the street, and spared the scolding sometimes given by his parents in anger. In this year, the cries of scolding children are rising faster than prices!

Death, perhaps only gives the weeping mother the present pain, and after a few months or a year or two, when she has another child, she will have infinite joy again.

It is said that the child's death was only a matter of a few hours. He suffered from convulsions that many loose medicines and doctors could cure.

But he died.

"...The neighborhood is having a Taiping Gong Zhai ceremony, this child can be considered to know how to die." An old woman with bound feet said murmurmingly, holding a string of destiny beads.

I thought: People are born and die randomly, from ancient times to now. Who can determine exactly what kind of person this child will become in the future? This clear-faced child has intelligent eyes. But he died. Leaving behind the sobbing of that young woman.

And the resentful sobbing also has a time of silence!

In a novel by Zuo Zhuli, he imagined that there should be a: "Strict Citizen Survival Review Committee" to judge whether citizens are fit to survive; and to order citizens who are not fit to survive to end their lives within twenty-four hours.

Now, how many people who should die have not died!

Anecdotes

### Treasure Samuel Taylor Coleridge

— Translated by Su Renjie

Alexander came to an African village, and the chief entertained him very warmly, placing golden fruits and bread before him. Alexander asked curiously, "Do you eat gold here?"

"I think you must be able to find things to eat in your own country. Why did you come here for anything other than gold?" the chief replied.

"Your gold cannot lead me here..." Alexander said, "But I would like to know some of your customs and habits."

Just then, two natives came in, bowed deeply to the chief, and the first one opened his mouth and said, "I bought a piece of land from him. When I was digging a trench, I suddenly discovered a treasure. When I bought it from him, I did not buy this treasure inside, so it should be his, but he refuses to accept it."

The second one replied, "I hope I have a good conscience like them. When I sold this piece of land, it naturally included everything, and this treasure should be his."

The chief pondered for a while, then asked, "Do you have a son?"

"Yes."

The chief then asked the other one: "Do you have a daughter?"

"Yes."

"Good," the chief ruled: "Your son will marry his daughter, and give this treasure to the new couple as a dowry."

Alexander watched from the side and was very surprised. Seeing this, the chief asked, "Do you think my judgment is incorrect?" "Oh, no, but I am very surprised," Alexander replied.

"Then how is such a thing judged in your country!" the chief asked again.

"To be honest, we confiscate this treasure and send it to the emperor."

Now it was the chief's turn to be surprised. After hearing this, he shouted loudly: "For the emperor's use? Is there a sun over there?"

"Yes."

"Does it rain over there?"

"Of course!"

"Strange! But are there grazing animals over there?"

"Many, of all kinds."

"Ah! That's right." The chief said with a sudden realization: "For the sake of these innocent animals, God is willing to continue to let sunlight and raindrops fall on your country."

Chapter Six: A Dangerous Experience

Ni Jinshou nodded repeatedly in agreement, replying, "That's easy. Should I take care of it right away—"

Ni Jinshou did not finish his sentence when his right hand had already reached for the electric bell button next to the desk, ready to press it to call in the errand boy outside. Unexpectedly, there were two light knocks on the office door, and a uniformed errand boy had already pushed his way in, holding a business card in his hand. Ni Jinshou took the card and glanced at it, reading aloud, "Lu Jiansheng." He looked up at Huo Sang, as if asking whether to grant an audience. Huo Sang thought for a moment and nodded. Ni Jinshou relayed the same action to the errand boy.

A minute later, Lu Jiansheng, with his head held high and his big belly sticking out, strolled in. He was quite tall and large, with a round, plump face that was fair and tender. Although his hair was already balding, he looked to be over fifty, but he didn't seem old. He had a flat, large nose, sparse, light eyebrows, and a pair of lively eyes that seemed very cunning. In fact, this pair of eyes was truly his only magic weapon, capable of exerting power, flattering, and adapting to circumstances with ease. When he strolled in, his eyes seemed to be set on the "exerting power" button. He wore a light gray, thin flannel robe and a pair of shiny, black leather shoes. When I saw his shoes, my heart skipped a beat. They were quite large and had a round toe.

As he walked in, Ni Jinshou had already stood up respectfully, greeting him with, "Mr. Lu, please have a seat." Lu Jiansheng merely nodded. The distance of the head movement, front to back, was no more than two inches, and it remained held high. He held a cigar between the index and middle fingers of his right hand, waved it casually, and sat down on the white cloth-covered sofa opposite us. Huo Sang merely glanced at the man out of the corner of his eye and continued to sit with his right knee held up. I did not stand up either. Lu Jiansheng did not greet us, as if only others greeted him, and he never greeted others first as a rule.

He cleared his throat and began to say to Ni Jinshou, "Well? Have you found the murderer yet?"

Ni Jinshou was stunned for a moment before sitting down and replying, "Mr. Lu, this case is very complicated. I still don't know who the murderer is—"

Lu Jiansheng's powerful eyes gained even more elements of power. "What? You still don't know who the murderer is? What have you been doing all this time?"

I felt that the word "you" seemed to include me and Huo Sang as well. I was a little annoyed. Huo Sang, however, kept his eyes half-open and half-closed, as if he were resting, and made no expression at all. Ni Jinshou was a little embarrassed. He glanced at Huo Sang and then back at Lu Jiansheng. At this moment, an errand boy came in carrying a tray with four cups of tea, placing them in front of each person, and then walked back out, which finally weakened the tense atmosphere a little.

Ni Jinshou said, "Mr. Lu, this case involves more than one person. Mr. Huo and Mr. Bao—ah, let me introduce you. This is Mr. Huo Sang, and this is Mr. Bao Lang—" (99)

### Brief Thoughts

— Tu Hulin

A secret, A told B, and then said to him, "Don't tell anyone else." B then told C the secret, also saying, "Don't tell anyone else." C then told D, and also said the same sentence: "Don't tell anyone else." D then told... and so on. In this way, a secret is made public without anyone realizing it.

Those who haven't read books hope to read them, but students who are currently reading books often hope for a vacation and are tired of reading.

Very true, "The purpose of life seems to be just to tear off a few dozen calendars," a friend said.

People who were once unknown use all sorts of methods to make themselves famous. Now, famous people use all sorts of methods to make themselves unknown.

A knife doesn't kill people; the person holding the knife does.

Each birthday is a step closer to the grave, so birthdays are not worth celebrating but are very worth mourning.

### The Vastness of the Universe

Once, Albert Einstein's wife visited the Wilson Observatory in California, USA, and someone showed her a huge telescope with a 100-inch aperture. She was very happy to see it and asked them what the telescope was used for. So they told her that one of its uses was to allow people to look through it to seek the shape of the universe.

"Oh, I see. My husband also often seeks the shape of the universe on the back of an old envelope."

### Pioneer of Film

— Zu Geng

Who were the first actors in film? It is now known that the first to act in film were not people, but horses. The horses' names were Occident, Wildflower, Sunol, and E'echioneer.

These four horses performed in Palo Alto, California, between 1878 and 1879. The first commemorative film can be seen at the Stanford Muybridge Exposition. Horses were the earliest experimental subjects in film. At that time, there were no cameras like those we have today. These horse stars' photos were taken with a series of twenty-four slow-motion cameras. They themselves were the photographers. As they walked past the camera box, they pulled the camera closer with ropes, thus taking the photos.

The 50th anniversary of this event was held at Stanford University, attended by many film entrepreneurs. Alec Biffle Romsey spoke on behalf of the filmmakers, saying that he paid tribute to the first photographed horse, Occident, and erected a monument on the grass to commemorate this earliest success.

### Island Theater Talk

— Weiwei

Recently, the Beijing-style opera stars invited by Huang Jin have been arriving in a steady stream. However, in terms of supporting roles, the martial arts actors are always Wu Yanheng and Gao Shenglin, the painted-face actors are always Qiu Shengrong and Yuan Shihai, and everything else is nothing more than the familiar faces of Ye Shengjian, Ma Fulu, Guan Shengxi, and Ai Shiju. It is very likely that the audience will suspect that the so-called birthplace of famous actors, Beijing, has no one else besides these people. In fact, the old capital is full of talent; it is just that many famous actors are either too arrogant or have strange tempers, resulting in few opportunities to come south. Huang Jin is now preparing to break through this difficulty and wants to invite a few of these famous actors who are unwilling to come south easily. It is said that two famous actors are currently in negotiations with Huang Jin, namely Hou Xirui and Ru Fulan.

### Hou Xirui Invited to Come South

Hou Xirui is the best Jing (painted face) talent from Fu Liancheng. Not only do the general Jing actors produced by Fu Liancheng learn from him, but he is also one of the top three Jing actors today. In terms of art, except for his voice not being as good as Hao Jin's, his martial arts skills, posture, facial makeup, and aura are all above Hao Jin and the other. In his prime, Hou Xirui was part of six troupes in the old capital. Mei (Lanfang), Yang (Xiaolou), Cheng (Yanqiu), and Shang (Xiaoyun) all regarded him as their right-hand man. The last time Xirui came to Shanghai was with Mei Lanfang, which was more than a dozen years ago. Since then, Cheng Yanqiu invited him to come south twice, but neither came to fruition, partly because he was unwilling to come south and partly because he was too arrogant, wanting to bring nine assistants with him, which made the theater owners shake their heads. As a result, people in Jiangnan have not had the opportunity to see this artist for more than a decade. Huang Jin is now sending people to Ping to contact Xiao Cuihua, and at the same time, is sincerely inviting Hou Xirui.

### Ru Fulan Likely to Come to Shanghai

Ru Fulan is also an outstanding talent from Fu Liancheng. He originally studied martial arts as a Xiaosheng (young male character), but later became a martial arts actor after graduating. In recent years, due to nearsightedness, he was unsuitable for performing martial arts plays and returned to being a Xiaosheng from a martial arts actor. Fulan's art is quite unique. His masterpieces such as "Battle of Puyang," "Eight Hammers, Second Visit to the Village," and "Night Flight" can be called the best in today's Peking opera world. Ye Shenglan's martial arts skills were all learned from Fulan. Therefore, Shenglan's "Battle of Puyang" and other top plays can also enjoy great fame. In the martial arts actor line, after Yang Xiaolou, Zhou Ruian, Sun Yukun, and Ru Fulan were the three successors to the Yang school. Now that Ruian is gradually entering old age, Yukun and Fulan are both in their prime. Although, on the whole, Fulan may be slightly inferior to Yukun, Fulan is beyond the reach of the later generation of martial arts actors. Huang Jin had intended to invite Fulan when he invited Li Shengzao last time, but it did not materialize because Fulan was unwilling to play the Xiaosheng role. Now that the old matter is being brought up again, it has been decided to invite him to play the martial arts actor role, coming together with Xiao Cuihua or Xin Yanqiu. This matter is likely to be resolved without problems.

### Secrets of the Silver Screen

— Yong

The secrets of the silver screen can be said to be countless. Here, I will talk to you about two that can be seen in almost every film.

The first is the shot of breaking glass. Readers should not believe that the broken glass is real. So what exactly is used to replace it? For a period of time, a sugary substance was used, but recently, rosin has been used instead.

The second is shots of drinking and the like. In fact, actors in films mostly drink herbal tea instead of alcohol! And the use of ginger ale as champagne is also unknown to outsiders.
