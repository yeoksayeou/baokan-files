### Confused News of the Vietnam Incident: French Government Determined to Protect Rights, Warns Public Not to Believe Rumors, Awaits Negotiation Results; One Account Says Japan's Request Has Been Accepted, Allowing Japanese Troops to Pass Through; Chinese Army Denies Entering Vietnamese Territory

VICHY: The French government yesterday warned the public not to lightly believe rumors spread by foreign countries regarding the current situation in Annam, and asked the public to calmly await the outcome of negotiations with Japan. France's rights will definitely be protected. (Haitong Telegram, 23rd)

HONG KONG: According to the Chongqing Dagongbao, the Vichy French government has accepted the Japanese request to allow Japanese troops to pass through Vietnam to attack Yunnan Province in the north. Observers claim that this step was expected since Vietnam allowed the Japanese inspection team to investigate the situation there. (International News Agency, 23rd)

VICHY: Regarding the promotion of commerce between Japan and French Indochina, the French government sent a note to the Japanese government at the end of last week. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs received a reply from Japan today. It is reported that there are still some difficulties that have not been resolved, and negotiations are continuing. (Havas, 22nd)

CHONGQING: Authoritative sources here today solemnly denied rumors that the Chinese army had crossed the Annam border, and emphasized that the Chinese government had not received any protests from French Indochina. (Haitong News Agency, 23rd)

VICHY: According to well-informed sources here, Japan's reply to France's proposal for resolving the Vietnam issue arrived here yesterday afternoon. French officials are reportedly very dissatisfied with the Japanese response, as Japan is demanding not only the establishment of naval and air bases in Vietnam, but also the use of railways to transport troops and joint management of Vietnam. (Haitong News Agency, 23rd)

CHONGQING: A Reuters dispatch from Vichy on the 14th of this month stated that fierce fighting was taking place between China and Japan along the Vietnamese border, but this had not been officially confirmed. A Haitong dispatch from Vichy on the 18th of this month stated that, according to reports from Hanoi, several Chinese army units were planning to cross the Vietnamese border but were repelled by French troops. A Domei dispatch from Vichy on the 19th of this month stated that, according to Hanoi, the Chinese army was attempting to invade Vietnam under the pretext of strengthening border defenses, and had concentrated five divisions of troops, deploying them at key military points along the Vietnamese border. Since August 7th, this Chinese army had attempted to enter Vietnamese territory, and the Vietnamese authorities had protested to China. The reporter, finding the matter too bizarre, visited an observer in diplomatic circles to inquire about the truth. The gentleman said that the purpose of such rumors was very simple and worthless to spell out. The Japanese had been coveting Vietnam for a long time. Taking advantage of France's exhaustion, they were pressuring the former Vietnamese authorities to accept their unreasonable demands. However, if they did not create an excuse, launching an attack rashly would be difficult to justify to the world. Therefore, the Japanese have recently been fabricating various false reports and trying to force the Vichy government to recognize these false reports as the basis for the Japanese army to send troops to Vietnam. From the above rumors, all originating from Vichy and promoted by Domei, the truth can be clearly understood. The Chinese government has solemnly denied the above rumors, and Reuters also firmly proved their inaccuracy on the 20th. In the future, the Japanese will inevitably have various propaganda, but if one can see through their background, all rumors will lose their effect. (23rd)

### Kong Xiangxi Suffering from Malaria

CHONGQING: Official sources recently stated that Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi is suffering from malaria but is expected to recover within a few days. (Reuters, 23rd)

### Rumors of National Government Relocation Completely Groundless

CHONGQING: Rumors that the National Government is relocating from Chongqing are completely unfounded. The addresses of various government agencies have indeed changed due to being bombed by Japanese aircraft, but all important government departments are firmly staying here. They may be setting up new offices outside of Chongqing or in the suburbs due to the Japanese bombings, but they are all in the vicinity of Chongqing. Moreover, all major agencies will move back to Chongqing or its suburbs after the air raids are over. Although there was a bombing as late as October 20th last year, the number of air raids will likely decrease after October, as the winter climate is mostly foggy and rainy, and the raids will have to be postponed until April of the following year. The rumor that the government is moving to Xichang in southeastern Xikang is completely nonsense. The source of this rumor is mainly due to the government using Xichang as the center for developing the wealthy southeastern region of Xikang. (Reuters, 23rd)

### National Government Issues Order to Commend Qian Hongye

He should be commended by order, and a funeral expense of 2,000 yuan should be issued. In addition, the Judicial Yuan should follow the usual procedures and provide preferential compensation to comfort his loyal soul and encourage those who come after him. This is the order. (23rd)

Editorial

### Scientists and China

Political clarity, economic development, and even military warfare, in seeking to overcome the enemy and achieve results, the academic community should bear the responsibility, accounting for nine out of ten. This is especially evident in the recent European war. New types of weapons, sharp and swift, emerge endlessly, and those who create them and use them all judge their merits based on academic knowledge. If one cannot create these powerful weapons, even if there are abundant materials in front of them or hidden in the ground, they are just waste and rubbish. If one has these powerful weapons but cannot use them, they are just stubborn iron and rotten steel. Although they are the same human beings and the same materials, why is there such a clear difference in skill and such a wide gap in quality? This is simply because of the unevenness of academic standards. Therefore, in the past, when entering the battlefield, it was about strength and courage; now, it is about comparing advantages in the slightest of bullets. In the past, being able to write and respond was enough to enter the official career; now, one must have specialized knowledge to be able to take on partial political affairs. In the past, doing business was just about trading what one had for what one needed; now, one must first be familiar with the surpluses and deficits of international production and sales, and the changes in supply and demand, to be able to compete in the commercial arena. All of this requires practical knowledge to be effective. Moreover, the so-called knowledge is not something that can be put to use by simply reading a few books of principles. It has no constant teacher, no constant place, and constantly innovates with the times without knowing where the end lies. In the past, studying was generally in a static state for thousands of years. When studying principles, there was a warning against deviating from the classics. When studying the investigation of things and the extension of knowledge, there was a warning against indulging in objects and losing one's ambition. Those who have deeper achievements are secretly pleased with themselves, with the idea that the skill resides in the person and is lost when the person dies. Compared with the current academic world, which strives for perfection, and the scientific spirit of real evidence, it is not just two eras, but two worlds. The basic concepts and basic attitudes of studying in ancient and modern times are indeed completely different.

China lags far behind in modern science. It is not that there are no outstanding individuals who have created unique achievements, but because the general level is too low, there is a view that it is disconnected from general academics. Moreover, because general society ignores science and scientists, their highest functions are buried. At this great time, to strive for survival, we must mobilize the entire society to believe in science with the spirit of religious faith and catch up quickly, so that we can have a chance. To say that the wisdom of a large nation is not as good as others, to say that the past inferiority means that we must always lag behind in the future, is self-defeating talk. The progress of a country's academic knowledge truly depends on the efforts of those who devote themselves to academics, but it also depends on society urging them, rewarding them, supporting them, trusting them, and worshiping them, so that they can persevere and achieve their goals. Setting them up as role models and cultivating a good atmosphere, if general life becomes scientific, then this society is a modern society and this country is a modern country. If one listens to the radio at home and rides a motorcycle outside, this is a modern life. However, if one only loves to listen and only loves to ride, if the whole society loves to listen and loves to ride like this, if the whole society can only buy and enjoy it but cannot create it, let alone invent it, then the lag is very serious and the lack of scientific approach is very serious. Why is this so? Scientists are truly rare, and there is fundamentally no society that cultivates scientists. For forty or fifty years since the rise of new learning, primary and secondary schools have had introductory science courses. However, the traditional unscientific attitude has obscured them, the country and society have not made efforts to promote them, the atmosphere has suppressed them, and life has hindered them. On the contrary, all kinds of people who do not know what science is can also seek profit and gain, and those who study science and gain fame, profit, and even official positions may not have obtained them because of their study of science.

The achievements of scientists are not a matter of one day or one night, nor can they be achieved in one step. Cultivating scientists is the common responsibility of the country and society. Take the imperial examination era as an example: Jiangsu is known for having many top scholars, not because the people of Jiangsu are particularly outstanding, but because the economic conditions in Jiangsu Province are superior, which can nurture a literary atmosphere, and scholars can carefully study without worrying about being cold and hungry. Scientists are not comparable to talented scholars who study traditional essays. Seeking truth from facts is not something that can be forced, and everything emphasizes experimentation. Equipment, reagents, materials, constant effort, thoroughness of equipment, and the mental and financial resources to get up again after falling, if one is missing, progress cannot be made, or there may be failure at the last step. Therefore, to cultivate scientists, one must make those who are determined to study science have a stable life. This is true for national cultivation. In society, subsidies for the tuition fees of poor students are gradually becoming a trend, but grants for scientific undertakings, although heard of, are still rare. It is hoped that in the future, scholarship funds can also be heard of and rise up like a storm. As for today's industry, it is a product of modern science. In an era of rapid change, it is especially necessary to have scientists who bury themselves in hard work and catch up quickly, engaging in continuous improvement. Therefore, if factories are content to stand still and are willing to fail, then so be it. Otherwise, they should use the strength of one factory or one industry, and each year, take out a certain amount from their profits as scientific awards directly or indirectly related to their business. On the one hand, it is especially hoped that young people with ambition will gather their comrades and engage in research, creating many amateur scientists, so that society will be full of interest in science and will become a prevalent atmosphere, then the progress of Chinese science can be counted on the days to come. Those who usually enjoy the benefits of human science can also repay it with scientific achievements. "To bring welfare to the people and to create peace for all ages," the responsibilities of scientists cannot be ignored.

### Japanese Aircraft in Three Batches Again Bombed Chongqing Yesterday, Causing Two Major Fires; Bombs Also Fell on the South Bank of the Yangtze River

CHONGQING: At noon today, Japanese aircraft in three batches bombed Chongqing, causing two fires. Anti-aircraft guns gave them a heavy bombardment. The alert was issued here at 10:45 AM, followed by an emergency alert half an hour later. Just as residents were taking shelter in air-raid shelters, Japanese bombers appeared in the sky and dropped bombs on two districts some distance from Chongqing. Several bombs fell on the south bank of the Yangtze River. One of the places bombed was the Asia Oil Station, where a bomb hit houses downstream, causing a major fire. The other area was Tanzi Stone, located downstream where the Jialing River enters the Yangtze River. The British gunboat Falcon is currently moored at a point downstream of Tanzi Stone. (Reuters, 23rd)

CHONGQING: Chinese officials recently stated that, up to yesterday, Japanese aircraft have attacked Chongqing 38 times this year, costing the Japanese US$46 million. However, only 2,051 Chinese people have been killed by the bombing. On average, it costs the Japanese more than one ton of explosives to kill one person. According to the Air Raid Relief Association, in addition to the 2,051 killed, 3,479 Chinese people were injured, and 17,000 buildings and other structures were destroyed. A senior officer of the Chinese Air Force said that the massive amount of incendiary bombs dropped by Japanese aircraft on Monday and Tuesday proves that the Japanese aim to destroy the entire city. According to an investigation report, in these two air raids, no fewer than thirty foreign stores, homes, and other buildings in the city were destroyed by fire. On Monday, 190 bombers flew into the skies over Chongqing, and on Tuesday, 170 bombers were guided by a large number of reconnaissance planes. He also stated that the claim that Japanese fighter planes participated in the air raids was inaccurate, as Japanese fighter planes could not fly here from Hankou or Yuncheng, and the airport in Yichang had not been completed for full use. According to a survey by Reuters, no fewer than thirty foreign agencies and homes were burned or damaged. The great fires in the city on Monday and Tuesday have razed to the ground seventeen buildings, including the American Asia Insurance Company, the Asia Film Company, the American International Assurance Company, the Barry Company, the Indo-China Steam Navigation Company, Jardine Matheson, Butterfield & Swire, Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada, the China Inland Mission, and the Methodist Episcopal Church. Chinese officials commented on the Japanese spokesman's claim that 3,300 aircraft had participated in the 38 attacks on Chongqing and that 2,500 tons of bombs had been dropped, saying that the Chinese had shot down 64 Japanese aircraft. These 64 Japanese aircraft alone have cost the Japanese US$32 million. In addition, the 448 Japanese airmen killed in the air raids have cost the Japanese another US$9 million. They also said that the gasoline consumed by the 3,300 Japanese aircraft amounted to US$4.3 million, and the 2,500 tons of bombs dropped were worth more than US$2 million. In total, the Japanese air raids on Chongqing have cost US$46 million. An Air Force officer recounted that the Scottish Bible Society, the Canadian Church Hospital, the Chongqing YMCA, and the residence of American businessman Xue Weier were completely burned down, and that several other places were damaged, including Jardine Engineering Corporation, Standard Oil, Reiss & Co., China General Edison, Mobil Oil, British American Tobacco, and several agencies of the Associated Press, Reuters, Havas, DNB, and Reuters. The Chongqing Federation of Labor has issued a declaration stating that "The workers of Chongqing have witnessed everything and will never forget these tragic days. They will never forget this blood debt. We should obey the guidance of the government in order to retaliate." (AP, 23rd)

CHONGQING: The Chongqing Business Daily, a newspaper with a long history in this city, was also affected when Japanese aircraft bombed Chongqing yesterday, and the building was completely destroyed by fire. However, the newspaper has found a temporary location and will continue to publish as usual. (Havas, 23rd)

### Spokesman for the Chinese Army Talks About Recent War Situation

CHONGQING: A reporter recently met with a military spokesman to discuss the war situation this week. According to him, the Chinese army's attacks in southern Guangdong and northern Shandong this week have achieved great results. Zengcheng had long become an important Japanese stronghold, and its outer strongholds, such as Fuhe and Guantang, had strong fortifications. The Chinese army recently used all their strength day and night to completely recapture Fuhe and Guantang. The Japanese retreated to Zengcheng. On the Qidong side of northern Shandong, which is an important Japanese rear base, the Chinese army recently launched a surprise attack, even entering the city and thoroughly destroying various Japanese military facilities. The Japanese suffered heavy losses and were extremely panicked, as Qidong is deep in the Japanese rear and had been occupied by the Japanese for a long time. The sudden attack made them suspect that divine troops had descended from heaven. The reporter then asked about recent rumors that Japan was frequently transferring troops within its country, seemingly with the intention of sending reinforcements to China. The spokesman vaguely said that the Japanese have been fighting in China for three years and have suffered heavy casualties. The source of soldiers has now been exhausted, and there is no way to replenish them. Recently, they have newly established military districts in their country in order to strengthen control over the people and force them to enlist. This is a sign of their desperate situation. Maintaining the status quo is already difficult, so how can they send reinforcements? Therefore, the rumors are probably a misinterpretation of these measures. As for the Japanese aircraft's recent brutal bombing of various places, it further shows the Japanese's lack of wisdom. Japan's number of aircraft and replenishment capabilities are far inferior to Germany's, but they are blindly imitating them, indiscriminately bombing and wasting bombs, which is self-defeating. It can be seen that their military authorities are unwise. As for the indiscriminate bombing of innocent civilians, what military effect does it have? There are many foreign residents in Chongqing, and they must all be laughing at their shamelessness. (20th)

### Madame Chiang is Concerned About Refugees Bombed in Chongqing, Drives to Inspect Various Disaster Areas, and Gives Instructions to Staff at Tea and Porridge Stations

CHONGQING: Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek is deeply concerned about the people who have been made homeless by the air raids on Chongqing, and has launched a five-point plan to help the refugees and enable the city to avoid air raids in the future. (AP, 23rd)

CHONGQING: Madame Chiang is very concerned about the victims of the bombing in this city. This afternoon, after 5:00 PM, she drove to various disaster areas to inspect them. She saw the tea and porridge stations run by the New Life Movement Association, which were crowded with victims. Madame Chiang immediately got out of the car to express her condolences. The victims were all deeply grateful. Madame Chiang also gave instructions and encouragement to the staff at the tea and porridge stations. (23rd)

The party ended in joyful dissipation at 6 o'clock. (23rd)

### The Conversation Between Craigie and Matsuoka: British Undersecretary Answers Questions from Members of Parliament

London - Liberal Party MP Mander inquired of the Undersecretary in the House of Commons yesterday whether Sir Robert Craigie, the British Ambassador to Japan, had received a reply regarding his request to Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka for a clear explanation of Japan's future foreign policy direction, and whether the Undersecretary had made any comments regarding the withdrawal of British troops from Shanghai and other areas of the Far East. Butler replied in writing, "I am unaware that Craigie made such a direct request. However, Mr. Mander must have seen the Japanese government's statement on general policy issued on August 1 in the newspapers. I have no comments to make at this time on the second point in Mr. Mander's question." (Reuter's dispatch, 23rd)

### German Long-Range Guns Bombard the Southeastern Coast of England, British Air Force Launches Massive Bombing Raid on Calais Area, German Planes Bomb Suburbs of London Again

London - German long-range guns on the northern coast of France began a 45-minute bombardment of the southeastern corner of England yesterday evening. However, British bombers immediately retaliated with a whirlwind bombing of the gun battery. Nevertheless, in the minutes before the British counterattack, more than 20 shells weighing over a ton each landed and exploded in the Dover area of Kent. It is reported that some platoons of the German artillery squadron, consisting of four guns, were completely annihilated and others were heavily damaged after the most intense British bombing. Dozens of British fighters launched a large-scale counterattack on Calais and Boulogne, where anti-aircraft batteries fired intensely. Smoke and flames rising into the sky could be seen from the British coast. The bombardment of the southeastern coast of England by guns located 20 to 30 miles away resulted in loss of life and property. Many houses were reduced to rubble, like eggshells being crushed. Among the remains of the dead, several women and clergy were found, seemingly a prelude to the long-awaited invasion of England. At the same time, it was reported that German planes again flew over various parts of England and Wales, bombing everywhere. Prior to the German artillery bombardment of the British coast, a total of 30 German planes, three of which were shot down by the British. According to reports, German 14-inch long-range guns had earlier bombarded British escort ships in the English Channel for 54 minutes, firing a total of 108 shells. Later, German planes also attacked the escort ships, but none of the British ships were damaged. (International News Agency dispatch, 23rd)

London Harbour - German heavy guns on the French coast bombarded the southeastern coast of England last night. "Observers along the Channel saw flashes of gunfire and heard shells whistling through the air before exploding with a roar. More than a dozen shells fell. Amidst the artillery fire were the sounds of anti-aircraft guns and exploding bombs, as British Air Force fighters were launching a fierce attack on the German gun batteries. The British Air Force attacked twice, the second time even more intensely. During the initial British attack, the enemy guns were temporarily silent, but the gunfire soon resumed. The damage caused was considerable, but casualties were light. A church was hit and collapsed, but residents had already entered air-raid shelters, so there were few casualties." (Reuter's dispatch, 23rd)

A Town on the Southeastern Coast of England - German artillery on the French coast of the English Channel began bombarding the coastal area of Kent in southeastern England at 9 p.m. last night (6 a.m. Shanghai summer time today) and continued to create an artillery barrage at 11 p.m. (8 a.m. Shanghai summer time this morning). British coastal batteries also returned fire across the Channel. The entire Channel coast was shaken by the intense artillery fire. Large shells screamed through the air and bombarded England. Before 10 p.m. yesterday, German long-range guns bombarded 18 British escort ships in the Channel for 80 minutes. The reporter saw the escort ships enter Dover harbor and then head east. British fighters flew overhead to provide cover, while other fighters patrolled between the French coast and the warships. The German artillery bombarded the ships for 40 minutes, but the ships continued on their course without changing direction. Small boats and British destroyers completely obscured the ships with smoke. Later, dive bombers took off from the French coast and began attacking the escort ships. The sea was filled with white spray hundreds of feet high. The warships and merchant ships responded with anti-aircraft fire to prevent the bombers from making low-level bombing runs. British fighters then engaged the enemy planes in fierce combat. Experts here estimate that the German gun batteries were firing at a rate of ten rounds per minute, with a total of 80 to 100 shells fired. However, it is understood that none of the ships were hit. It is believed that at least two German bombers were heavily damaged. (United Press dispatch, 23rd)

Berlin - German coastal artillery units conducted firing exercises yesterday to determine the range of their guns. Many guns have been deployed along the English Channel and the Atlantic coast. The artillery fire boomed for hours. (Haitong dispatch, 23rd)

British Convoy Sails Unhindered

London - Authoritative observers believe that the German long-range artillery bombardment of England further demonstrates the signs of German intentions for a future invasion of England. Although the British convoy was bombarded, it is still sailing in the Channel, which contradicts German claims. The bombardment has clearly failed to disrupt British shipping. British destroyers still maintain control of the English coast. The general public suspects the inconsistency between the two sides' statements, but it is believed that the victor's news is reliable. There is no doubt that in the Battle of Britain, Britain is winning, so British intelligence is more accurate. (International News Service dispatch, 23rd)

London - The following are the details of the German artillery positions on the French coast firing on a British convoy sailing in the Channel yesterday. The convoy, consisting of several merchant ships and their escorts, was approaching a harbor in the Channel at about 10 a.m. when suddenly loud artillery fire was heard from the French coast. Soon four columns of water were seen erupting upwards in the sea. The cities along the British Channel coast were also shaken by the artillery fire. A Reuters reporter who was standing on a rocky hill observing the situation estimated that the Germans were firing one round per minute. The shells landed in the sea and were clearly visible. Subsequently, the artillery fire became more frequent, about one round every half minute. Reuters personnel in London also clearly heard the artillery fire over the telephone while receiving this information. As the convoy passed through a harbor, the German heavy artillery fire between Calais and Boulogne became even more intense. The shells landed about 20 miles from the French coast. The escort ships immediately maneuvered around the ships they were protecting and laid down a smoke screen. After about half an hour, the bombardment was a waste of ammunition and had no effect. The convoy continued to advance without showing any sign of fear. At that time, a single enemy plane appeared in the sky over the Channel, probably a reconnaissance plane acting as eyes and ears for the German artillery positions, but it was quickly driven away by British planes. Suddenly, the sound of engines was heard, and a squadron of British fighters appeared in the sky. The convoy slowly sailed up the Channel. The German artillery on the coast near Calais then resumed its intense bombardment, the intensity of which did not diminish. The bombardment only began to weaken after the convoy passed Dover and headed towards Deal. The entire convoy safely passed through the Channel 80 minutes after the Germans opened fire, and no ships were hit. The bombardment was clearly a failure. The flashes of gunfire indicated the location of their artillery positions. A resident of the southeastern coast described the bombardment as follows: "Three of our warships laid down a black smoke screen and rushed to rescue the convoy. At that time, the sea was filled with thick smoke, and the shells fell, spraying seawater hundreds of feet high. The convoy was in a dangerous situation, but it continued to sail slowly and without panic. A large crowd stood on the rocks and beaches, watching the attack from afar. The convoy was also attacked from the air by enemy planes, but they were driven away by intense anti-aircraft fire and hastily dropped several heavy bombs, all of which landed in the sea."

Göring Issues Berlin Air Defense Order

Berlin - German Air Force Commander-in-Chief Göring issued an order stating that enemy planes have recently attempted to attack or fly into Berlin, so it is necessary to issue advance warnings to prepare. However, when an air raid alert is issued in Berlin, it does not necessarily mean that bombs will fall in the city of Berlin. Citizens only need to seek refuge in air-raid shelters or basements when the activity of searchlights or anti-aircraft guns indicates that enemy planes are approaching Berlin. In any case, people are not allowed to stand in the streets. Those who do not seek shelter in a safe place are simply inviting trouble for themselves. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 23rd)

### Rumors of Italy Pressuring Greece to Repeal British Guarantee, Greek Government Holds Special Meeting

London - A Reuters diplomatic correspondent stated that there has been no official confirmation here of rumors that Italy has issued a 24-hour ultimatum to Greece demanding that it repeal the British guarantee. This guarantee was announced in the House of Commons on April 13, 1939, stating that in the event of any action clearly threatening the independence of Greece and deemed important by the Greek government, requiring it to resist with all its national strength, the British government would feel obligated to immediately assist Greece with all its power. According to official statements, Britain is now firmly maintaining this guarantee, and that the rumors that Britain has occupied Corfu are completely unfounded and considered to be Italian propaganda. (Reuter's dispatch, 23rd)

London - According to a report from the Yugoslav capital by the "Daily Telegraph" correspondent, Italy has given Greece 24 hours to renounce the British guarantee of assistance to Greece in the event of an attack. According to reliable sources, Italy warned Greece that if it refused to renounce its agreement with Britain, a conflict would ensue immediately. Recently, the "Daily Mail" Athens reporter reported that crowds of Greeks in Crete protested loudly at the Italian consulate after hearing that an Italian submarine had sunk the Greek destroyer "Helle" last week. (United Press dispatch, 23rd)

### Argentine President Suddenly Resigns, Cabinet Also Submits Resignation Due to Corruption Scandal

Buenos Aires - Argentine President Dr. Ortiz resigned yesterday afternoon. Ortiz was elected on September 5, 1937, and took office on February 20 of the following year, with a six-year term. Ortiz has been in poor health, and his duties have long been carried out by Vice President Castillo. (Haitong dispatch, 23rd)

Buenos Aires - All Argentine cabinet members submitted their resignations to Acting President Castillo yesterday afternoon, but before the Legislative Assembly meets to discuss the president's resignation, the ministers, although resigned, will remain in office temporarily. If the Legislative Assembly approves President Ortiz's resignation, Vice President Castillo will legally succeed him until the end of the term in 1944. The reason for this cabinet crisis is that the Minister of Finance and the Minister of War embezzled huge sums of money in the construction of the Palermo airport, so the President resigned to take responsibility. The fate of the Cabinet awaits decision in Argentina. (Haitong dispatch, 22nd)

### Investigation into the Assassination of Trotsky, Mexican Authorities Investigate the Cause

Mexico City - After the assassination of former Soviet communist leader Trotsky, an autopsy was performed yesterday in accordance with Mexican law. The assassin, Jackson, intended to commit suicide, and the police have taken precautions to keep him detained in the hospital. (Haitong dispatch, 23rd)

Mexico City - Since the assassination of exiled Soviet revolutionary Trotsky, the Mexican authorities have been doing their best to investigate the terrorist activities of the Soviet secret police. An unofficial source claimed, "We are convinced that the assassin, Jackson (that is, Van den Dreissche), is a close confidant of Stalin. We also believe that he was involved in the attempted assassination on May 24 last year. That night, he may have been the one who ordered Hart, Trotsky's guard, to open the door to Trotsky's bedroom. He may have directly participated in the assassination, but he must have been the one who planned it." Trotsky's guards said, "If the police can get a confession from Jackson, we will be able to learn the whole truth. We need his confession, which is why we didn't kill him at the time." (United Press dispatch, 23rd)

### Large Number of Overseas Ambassadors and Consuls Recalled: Japanese Foreign Policy to Change; Outer Provinces Reject Pro-British and American Faction Members; Kensuke Horiuchi Also Among Those Recalled

Tokyo: Japanese Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka yesterday ordered the recall of forty Japanese diplomats, including five ambassadors, nineteen ministers, five counselors, and eleven consuls-general. In addition, there will be major changes in the personnel of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The recalled ambassadors include Kensuke Horiuchi, Ambassador to the United States; Toshihiko Taketomi, Ambassador to Turkey; Renzo Sawada, Ambassador to France; Kazue Kuwashima, Ambassador to Brazil; and Masaaki Horita, Ambassador-at-Large. This large-scale reshuffle is unprecedented in Japanese diplomatic history. Observers believe that under the cooperation of Matsuoka and Ohashi, Japanese foreign policy will undergo drastic changes. The newly appointed Acting Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, Tadashi Ohashi, told Japanese reporters yesterday, "Japanese diplomacy has entered a new era. All talented individuals will be promoted. New appointments for diplomatic officials will not be limited to officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Journalists may also be appointed." Ohashi stated that the successors to the recalled diplomats would be announced within a week. It is reported that Colonel Hashimoto, leader of the Japanese Youth Party, has accepted an invitation from Japanese Prime Minister Konoe to join the preparatory committee for a new Japanese political structure. (United Press dispatch, 23rd)

Tokyo: The "Asahi Shimbun" stated in an editorial today that Japan will adopt a harsh diplomatic policy toward Britain and the United States, which can be seen in the expulsion of pro-American and pro-British elements from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the diplomatic corps. The newspaper stated that Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka intends to completely reorganize the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, appointing a "collection of geniuses" and "expelling those within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs who are considered to belong to the so-called British and American factions" as steps to adjust Japanese foreign policy. Commenting on Foreign Minister's "recall of forty Japanese diplomatic officials," the newspaper stated that in the future, foreign diplomatic officials and officials in various departments of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs may be further reshuffled. The newspaper said that Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka will appoint a collection of geniuses from within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and from non-official sources. The "Asahi Shimbun" also stated that the recall of Japanese Ambassador to Washington, Kensuke Horiuchi, was inevitable, as he had suffered a diplomatic setback a year ago when the United States abolished the U.S.-Japan commercial treaty. Regarding the Far East, Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka will recall two consuls, Keinosuke Fujii in Beijing and Miura in "Manchukuo," as well as two consuls-general, Yoshida in Manila and Miyakawa in Vladivostok. (United Press dispatch, 23rd)

Suma Stated Yesterday That It Was Due to Administrative Needs

Tokyo: Foreign Ministry spokesman Suma, while receiving news reporters today, mentioned that Foreign Minister Matsuoka had redistributed diplomatic personnel yesterday, recalling five ambassadors, nineteen ministers, five counselors, and eleven consuls-general stationed abroad, saying that this was a routine matter, but that it was intended to introduce new people into diplomatic affairs to bring a new atmosphere. The recall of forty representatives had nothing to do with their competence or merit, and even less to do with the relations between Japan and the countries where they were stationed. Japan will have diplomatic relations with all the countries from which diplomatic representatives have been recalled, and arrangements have already been completed to ensure that there will be no difficulties or obstacles in Japan's dealings with these countries. Some of the vacancies will be filled immediately, while others will be filled within a month or two. The spokesman hinted that there were several vacancies that would not be filled, but would be handled by ministers stationed in other countries serving concurrently as chargés d'affaires. However, everything would depend on the development of the overall world situation in the next two months. When asked if the vacancy for the US ambassador would be filled, the spokesman replied that the position would be filled immediately, but that it might take some time to obtain "consent" for the new ambassador. Subsequently, someone asked whether any government had been consulted regarding the appointment of a new ambassador or minister plenipotentiary. The spokesman declined to answer, saying that this was not proper diplomatic practice. The spokesman reiterated that there was no special reason for the Foreign Minister's recall of forty diplomats, but that it was unavoidable due to higher administrative needs. When asked whether this move was a prelude to Japan's redetermination of its foreign policy, the spokesman gave the same answer as before. The spokesman then mentioned the issue of General Koiso, saying that everything would be clear within a week, and that General Koiso seemed to be seriously deciding his attitude towards the position of head of the commission to the Dutch East Indies during this week. (Reuters dispatch, 25th)

Washington Closely Watching New Developments in Japanese Diplomacy

Washington: Political circles here are puzzled by the reshuffle in the Japanese diplomatic corps. Some well-informed sources believe that the recall of forty Japanese diplomats may be a "startling move" to attract the attention of the Japanese people. Others refused to criticize the reshuffle in the diplomatic corps, with most officials commenting that changes in diplomatic personnel are often an internal matter for any country and are not relevant to other countries. When Foreign Minister Matsuoka first took office, there were general expectations of major changes in the Japanese diplomatic corps, due to Matsuoka's strong methods and the declaration to promote the "Greater East Asia" doctrine. However, a complete reshuffle did not materialize, as the entire Japanese diplomatic corps was almost entirely enthusiastic about promoting any policy of Tokyo. This impression makes people here believe that the changes in Japanese diplomatic personnel will only have minor changes on US-Japan relations. Well-informed people here refused to acknowledge that the new Japanese diplomatic reshuffle was merely an internal matter. Most non-official people here do not believe that Japan has definitely decided to join hands with the Rome-Berlin Axis. They claim that Japan may take a cautious attitude towards ventures in French Indochina and the Dutch East Indies until the outcome of the British war is more certain. The Japanese Embassy here has confirmed that Japanese Ambassador to the United States, Kensuke Horiuchi, has been ordered to return to Tokyo. The date of his return has not been decided. Embassy officials declined to comment or speculate on the meaning of the recall. The Japanese Minister to Canada and the Consuls-General in New York, Chicago, and San Francisco have all been ordered to return home. (United Press dispatch, 23rd)

### US and Canada Form Committee to Study Joint Defense Issues; First Meeting Scheduled for Monday; US President Allows Old Ships to Be Given to Britain

Washington: Today, President Roosevelt and Canadian Prime Minister King announced the list of members for the permanent Joint Defense Board, as follows: For the US side: (1) Mayor of New York City, La Guardia; (2) Lieutenant General Embick, Commander of the Fourth Army Corps Area; (3) Colonel Hills of the Operations Planning Section of the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations; (4) Major Schulman of the US Navy; (5) Lieutenant Colonel McNanney of the US Army Air Corps; For the Canadian side: (1) Biddle, former Vice-Chairman of the Canadian Aviation Committee; (2) Rear Admiral Stewart, Deputy Chief of Naval Staff; (3) Colonel Cofe, of the Canadian Air Force Staff Office. According to the above list, the last two members on the US side will alternate their attendance, one attending discussions on naval issues, and the other attending discussions on land and air force issues. The first meeting of the committee will be held in Ottawa on Monday. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)

Washington: President Roosevelt, along with Secretary of War Stimson, Secretary of the Navy Knox, Undersecretary of State Welles, and Attorney General Jackson, discussed the issue of leasing Atlantic bases to Britain yesterday. The difficulty regarding the transfer of overage destroyers has not yet been fully resolved. It is reported that the President favors the transfer, but the attitude of Congress is still an obstacle. It is desirable to avoid lengthy legislative procedures for this matter, but a method of avoiding the need for congressional approval has not yet been found. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)

### Britain Denies Alliance with the United States; Anglo-American Relations Growing Closer; Japan Expresses Concern

London: According to a statement from authoritative sources in London to a Reuters diplomatic correspondent, the rumor that the British government intends to conclude a military alliance with the United States, and that the current talks between Canada and the United States are merely the beginning of a complete military agreement, is completely unfounded and should be firmly denied. Washington also denied the same rumor yesterday, dismissing it as nonsense. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)

Hong Kong: Tokyo dispatch: All major newspapers here this morning published commentaries on the growing closeness between Britain and the United States. The newspapers believe that Prime Minister Churchill's speech in the House of Commons the day before yesterday, as well as the meeting between Roosevelt and King, are sufficient to show that Britain and the United States have become increasingly close. Many newspaper editorials believe that although the islands Britain is currently leasing to the United States are limited to the Atlantic, there may come a day when British territories in the Pacific may also be leased to the United States. The "Asahi Shimbun" pointed out that if Britain intends to lease its Pacific territories, such as the Bismarck Archipelago and other places in Australia, to the United States, Japan would express great concern. "Nichinichi Shimbun" stated that in order to extricate itself from its own crisis, Britain is attempting to disrupt the status quo in the Pacific, and Japan must firmly oppose this. "Yomiuri Shimbun" stated that although the islands that Britain is currently leasing to the United States do not include the Pacific, it is a natural trend that the scope of the lease will extend to the Pacific in the future as the situation develops. In particular, Vancouver and Victoria are located at the throat of the North Pacific, and the result of the US-Canada agreement will also make them US air force bases. At the same time, the US's proposed military road through Canada, if extended to Alaska, will make Alaska and the Bering Islands like Hawaii and become the US's forward air force bases, and the distance between them and the US mainland will be shortened. From this point of view, the Anglo-American and US-Canadian agreements not only affect the situation in Europe, but also have a significant impact on Japan's future. (Dispatch, 22nd)

### Important Historical Anniversary: First Anniversary of the German-Soviet Pact; Political and Economic Cooperation Between the Two Countries Lays the Foundation for Permanent Friendship

Moscow: August 23, 1940, marks the first anniversary of the signing of the Soviet-German Non-Aggression Pact. "Izvestia" published a commentary entitled "An Important Historical Anniversary," stating that "war provocateurs deliberately stirred up Soviet-German animosity, but since the signing of the Non-Aggression Pact, this animosity has ended. At the 18th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Stalin issued a serious warning to all war provocateurs who attempted to involve the Soviet Union in war for their own benefit. At that time, British and North American newspapers invented a German "seizure" of Soviet Ukraine "plan," but it was exposed by Stalin. Stalin said, "The purpose of this clamor seems to be to arouse Soviet animosity towards Germany, to poison the atmosphere at the time, and to provoke war with Germany for no reason." In the same report, Stalin clearly elaborated on Soviet foreign policy, saying, "We seek peace and seek to increase trade relations with all countries. This is our position. If other countries maintain the same relations with us and do not attempt to infringe on our interests, we will adhere to this position." Based on this policy, the Soviet Union immediately accepted the German proposal and began negotiations on a non-aggression pact. During the negotiations, both sides acted according to their respective fundamental national interests. Molotov said at the Fourth Congress of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, "History proves that Soviet-German war and animosity are harmful to both sides. As a result of the 1914-1918 war, the Soviet Union and Germany suffered the most losses. Therefore, the interests of the Soviet and German peoples do not lie in mutual animosity. On the contrary, the Soviet and German peoples need peaceful relations." The Soviet-German Pact, signed on August 23, 1939, was not only an important turning point in the history of Soviet-German relations, but also an important turning point for the whole of Europe and the world. The pact is truly the most important document in diplomatic relations in recent decades. (To be continued) (TASS dispatch, 23rd)

Berlin: German newspapers reviewed the effects of the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact in political, economic, and military aspects on the first anniversary of the pact. The "Essen National Daily" declared that Germany and the Soviet Union signed the Non-Aggression Pact on August 23, 1939. This simple text stipulated the relations between the signatory countries and created an atmosphere of peace, allowing Germany and the Soviet Union to cooperate in all aspects. The leaders of the two countries have placed the people of the two countries on a foundation of honesty. The German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact was signed on the eve of the European war, which naturally had an important impact on the military aspect, and the cooperation between Germany and the Soviet Union in the economic aspect was also of great significance. The signing of the transportation agreement on August 23, 1939, and the re-signing of various economic agreements on February 11, 1940, were not accidental consequences. The German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact has established the friendly relations between the two countries and laid the cornerstone for various agreements. Germany is no longer worried about the rear in its war against Western European countries, while the Soviet Union can also avoid being drawn into the vortex of war. Both Germany and the Soviet Union have obtained various economic benefits, and the construction work in Europe is also possible. The "German Foreign Policy News" declared that the Soviet Union, in view of the unrest in Europe, eliminated the possibility of disputes with intelligent action. The results of the first year of German-Soviet cooperation have proved that the signatories of the Non-Aggression Pact have realized their hopes. The Soviet Union has eliminated the unstable and dissatisfied factors in the west, and Germany has satisfied its needs through the exchange of goods between Germany and the Soviet Union. Germany and the Soviet Union have the determination to cooperate, and over the past year, they have solved various problems in a proper way. (Haitong dispatch, 23rd)

### Japan Strictly Controls Rice; To Be Implemented from September 1st

Tokyo dispatch: The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry announced that from September 10th, Japan will implement a special white rice control ordinance, which will enable the government to completely control the purchase and distribution of the nation's main food, white rice. According to "Miyako Shimbun," according to the new ordinance, the public cannot obtain white rice without going through the government-controlled distribution agency. The purchase and distribution of white rice has been unified by the Imperial Agricultural Association and the Japan Rice Company, and control is implemented in the producing areas, which can eliminate the complaints from residents of producing areas that it is easier to obtain rice than in urban consumption centers. From now on, all rice producers, whether landlords or tenants, can only sell rice to the Imperial Agricultural Association and cannot sell it to others. Only the government and the Japan Rice Company, which is controlled by the government, have the right to collect rice. Therefore, landlords living in the city cannot obtain the rice produced in their own fields, and even the rice eaten by farmers in the producing areas must be distributed to them by rice sales companies or merchants recognized by the authorities. The transportation of rice between counties is also controlled, so that farmers cannot send rice to their children studying in the city, and even bartering rice is prohibited. The severity of this ordinance is evident. (Dispatch, 23rd)

### Japan Plans to Mobilize Ten Thousand Monks; To Encourage People to Seek Divine Blessings

Tokyo: "Miyako Shimbun" recently reported that the Shrine Bureau of the Ministry of Home Affairs plans to add a committee to mobilize 15,000 monks to advise people to burn incense and worship every morning and evening. (Havas dispatch, 22nd)

### Strengthening Defense in Central District; Armored Cars Deployed This Morning; Rifles Issued and Training Provided Overnight; British Light Cavalry Also Called Up to Assist

The Hongkou West District of the British Defense Area of the Public Concession is currently temporarily defended by approximately 300 members of the A Company of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps (i.e., the British Company). However, the members are all volunteers, and they all have other legitimate occupations that they cannot ignore. Therefore, the Public Concession authorities have considered calling up the B Company (i.e., the American Company) for rotation. It was learned from sources related to the Concession authorities yesterday that the American Company of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps has not yet been ordered to be called up because the Japanese side still opposes any company other than the British Company of the Volunteer Corps defending the Hongkou West District. Therefore, the Public Concession authorities had to issue an order again at 5:00 PM yesterday, calling up a squadron of armored cars from the British Company of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps for deployment starting this morning to remedy the current difficulties of the A Company. In addition, the British Light Cavalry of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps Headquarters will also be called up. As for the B Company, it has not yet been called up to assist because the Japanese side has not yet agreed.

Armored Car Squadron Ordered to Mobilize

Since approximately 600 British defense troops withdrew from Shanghai starting at 11:30 AM yesterday, the A Company has felt inadequate in its defensive duties. The Concession authorities specially issued an order from Commander Hempel of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps at 5:00 PM last night, calling up the armored car squadron from the Volunteer Corps to assist. The armored car squadron is also a British unit, but it has never belonged to the A Company and is incorporated into the Volunteer Corps of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps. The original quota was 169 men, but there are many vacancies, and there are currently only over 90 men.

Rifles Issued Overnight, Taking Over Defense This Morning

The British armored car squadron is trained in armored car warfare, and is relatively less proficient in foot combat than in tank combat. Moreover, the weapons they usually use, in addition to the Lewis machine guns on the armored cars, are only seven-inch revolvers. For this reason, the Volunteer Corps Headquarters specially summoned them last night to issue rifles and rifle ammunition, and the instructors of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps Headquarters temporarily taught them the necessary techniques of foot troops in the Public Works Department barracks. They are scheduled to be deployed starting this morning to assist the A Company.

### Arnold Returns Home Early; Leaves Shanghai on the 5th of Next Month

The American Association of Shanghai has scheduled a farewell banquet for Arnold, the US Commercial Attaché in China, for the evening of September 5th. It has been learned that the date has been changed and moved to the evening of September 4th because Mr. Arnold has changed his return schedule and will leave Shanghai on September 5th, planning to take the China Clipper to the United States.

### Vietnamese Exports Still Use French Franc Standard; US Dollar Settlement Cancelled

After the Vietnamese authorities stipulated that all export goods should be settled in US dollars or Dutch currency, it was recently reported in transportation circles that the settlement in US dollars or Dutch currency by the Vietnamese authorities was once implemented, but has now been cancelled and the French franc has been restored as the standard. As for the reason for this cancellation, it is said to be due to British opposition, as Britain wants to maintain its gold pound standard and does not want to buy Vietnamese products in foreign currencies.

### Military Strategist Discusses the European War

A military strategist here said that Germany has already missed the opportunity to defeat Britain. If the German army had captured Sedan on May 18th and then gone straight to Paris, then Paris could have fallen one or two weeks earlier. If the German army had occupied Paris and then attacked Britain, then Britain's best land forces would have been in France, and they would have been less prepared to deal with a coastal surprise attack, making it easier to succeed. Delaying until now, Britain has gained air superiority, and its control of the sea and its land defenses have also made significant progress, so the difficulties will only increase in the future.

### Japanese Continue to Visit Tenants in Western Shanghai; Obstruct Payment of Rent

According to reliable sources, after several Japanese visited residents in the area of Route Tenant de la Tour and Avenue Joffre in western Shanghai, two Japanese men in Western-style suits, accompanied by many Chinese, rode around in three sidecar motorcycles from 1:00 PM on the afternoon of the day before yesterday to Chinese and Western residences nearby, advising all tenants to temporarily stop paying rent, because the Japanese army has not yet moved in to take over, etc. However, they did not state where they came from or the reason for the suspension of payments. To avoid trouble, the general residents did not ask them.

### Dutch Consul-General Temporarily Manages Hungarian Property Rights

The Dutch Consul-General in Shanghai, P. S. P. van Bosse, has recently been ordered to temporarily manage the property rights and interests of Hungarian citizens. Yesterday, he issued a special announcement to Hungarian citizens, stating that those who have resided in Shanghai for more than ten years must submit a request to the Dutch Consulate-General at No. 9 The Bund in the French Concession before August 31st of this year so that the consulate can protect the citizenship rights of all citizens.

### Japanese Warships and Aircraft Bombard Eastern Zhejiang Again

On the 22nd, four Japanese warships were anchored off the coast of Hengshan. Three of them sailed east at 5:00 AM on the 23rd, and one remained anchored in the same place. At 10:05 AM, two more Japanese warships sailed to the waters off Hengshan and fired ten shells at Xize Wharf in Xiangshan. The shells landed on the mud and sand, and we suffered no losses. At 12:12 PM on the 22nd, two small Japanese warships sailed from the north to Shipu and anchored off the coast of Zhulongshan without any changes. A Japanese warship anchored off the coast of Haimen fired six shells at the shore of Haimen at 6:00 AM yesterday and another four shells at around 12:00 PM, but the shells also landed on the mud and sand, so there were no losses. At 6:52 AM on the 22nd, four Japanese aircraft were spotted over Sanjiangkou in Shaoxing. They invaded Zhuji and Yiwu in Shaoxing and dropped 21 bombs in Yiwu. Many bombs hit near the station. After dropping the bombs, two aircraft returned along the same route, and two flew to the skies over Jinhua, circling three or four times before returning to Zhuji to drop bombs. The number of bombs dropped and the extent of the damage are unknown.

### British Ambassador Kerr Regularly Travels to Hong Kong to Fly to Chongqing; May Change to the President Coolidge; French Ambassador Cosme to Go to New Capital Next Month

British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, returned to Shanghai from Weihaiwei with his wife, etc., and has been residing at his private residence on Dunsing Road. Because it is currently high summer, he has been living a quiet life with little contact with the outside world, except for attending the British military review ceremony and the farewell dinner for Major General Simmons. Now that summer is passing and autumn is approaching, the Ambassador has decided to leave Shanghai by boat on the day after tomorrow (the 26th) to Hong Kong and then fly to Chongqing, and the journey is expected to arrive on September 1st. The Ambassador's wife and secretary will also accompany him on this trip. According to another source, the Ambassador will postpone his departure to the 28th and depart on the American mail ship President Coolidge to Hong Kong. The Ambassador's private residence in the suburbs of Chongqing, after being bombed and destroyed by Japanese aircraft, will now be temporarily housed in the newly surveyed British Embassy in the south bank.

Reunion of the Four Ambassadors of the United States, Soviet Union, Britain, and France

### The Second Batch of British Troops Embarked Yesterday; Full Withdrawal Expected Soon; Enthusiastic Farewell with Music Along the Way; Officers' Families to be Sent to Australia

The first batch of British defense troops, approximately 300, ordered to withdraw from Shanghai, boarded the Deisen Liner on the 21st and departed on the morning of the 12th. Yesterday morning, a second batch of 600 British troops from the East Surrey Regiment marched from the Jing'an Temple Road along Nanjing Road to Hongkou to embark. Around 9:00 AM, the troops left their camp in western Shanghai and marched to the Racecourse, where they rested for a while.

American Troops Played Music to See Them Off

At that time, the Fourth Regiment of the U.S. Marine Corps also arrived to see them off. At 11:00 AM, they set off together. The U.S. Marine Corps band played military music along the way, with clear and melodious tunes. Pedestrians lined the streets, standing and waving their hats, cheering and bidding farewell. The British troops also nodded and smiled in response. Some of the shops along the street displayed the British flag. When the British troops marched through the intersection of Nanjing Road and Sichuan Road, a patriotic Briton scattered colorful confetti from the rooftop. When the British troops turned onto the Bund and arrived in front of the British Consulate, the U.S. Marine Corps band played a farewell song, paying their respects. The British troops then marched across the Waibaidu Bridge, under the salute of the White Russian merchant corps guarding the bridgehead, and entered Hongkou to board their ship at the wharf.

Recruited British Soldiers Depart Together

According to a reporter's inquiry yesterday, the remaining British troops stationed here will be withdrawn successively over the next three days. By next Monday (the 26th), all British troops stationed in this city will be completely withdrawn. It is understood that there are currently five British ships prepared to transport British soldiers from Shanghai to Hong Kong and Singapore. In addition, about 200 British expatriates who have registered to join the British military service will leave Shanghai next Monday. The British soldiers recruited in this city will travel together with the Seaforth Highlanders regiment, which is scheduled to leave Shanghai on the "Narkunda" Liner on Sunday afternoon. The British Shipping Company's "Danda" Liner will depart today, carrying the families of British soldiers to Australia. Furthermore, the soldiers of the Seaforth Highlanders regiment guarding the British Consulate on the Bund were also withdrawn yesterday morning. It is rumored that the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department will send Indian constables to the British Consulate starting today to take over guard duties.

Withdrawal Costs Approximately One Million Yuan

Preparations for the British troop withdrawal have been underway for more than ten days. Jardine Matheson's requisitioned ships, Ewo, Arnhold, and Ewo, were specially painted in Shanghai, and the cabins were completely renovated. In addition to the original berths, more than a thousand temporary straw mattresses were custom-made. These straw mattresses were similar to Simmons mattresses in style and were very elaborate. The ship's dining hall was also improved, with new large dining tables made uniformly. The menu for lunch, dinner, and snacks were all pre-arranged and different each day. Living and dining on board were more comfortable than in the barracks. It is said that as many as 2,000 cases of beer were prepared, and each soldier was provided with HK$1 per day for food expenses. This price was the standard rate for previous British troop rotations by ship. The ship's stewards believed that the menu set for this trip was richer than that set for routine troop rotations. Moreover, with rising prices recently, they requested an increase of HK$0.50 from the company. The Shanghai office said that this matter belonged to the Hong Kong office and should be requested from Hong Kong. Therefore, the stewards planned to request it again after arriving in Hong Kong. All expenses, calculated in legal tender, could reach one million yuan.

### Three Hurricanes in the Pacific

Hurricanes in the Pacific Ocean are occurring one after another.

It had advanced to the sea east of the Ryukyu Islands. The third hurricane was just discovered this morning at 13 degrees North latitude and 136 degrees East longitude, heading West-Northwest.

### Summary of Important News

Packages to Tianjin and Beiping: The Parcel Delivery Group of the Shanghai Postal Administration announced yesterday that due to congestion and limited space in the large parcel group, all large packages to Tianjin and Beiping will be temporarily accepted by the Parcel Delivery Group starting from the 24th of this month. To ensure clarity, Counter No. 9 will be dedicated to receiving packages for Tianjin, Counter No. 10 will be dedicated to receiving packages for Beiping, and other miscellaneous goods will be received by Counters No. 6, 7, and 8. All postal package merchants are requested to take note.

Coal Ball Prices: The eighth phase of low-priced coal balls sold a total of 6,300 piculs of low-priced balls and will cease from the 20th. The ninth phase is pending a decision at the meeting. Currently, the source of coal dust is abundant, and the cost of production has been reduced. All retail prices on the market, whether factory or store sales, should be reduced accordingly. However, the relevant trade association is still waiting and watching, which is inexcusable.

Situation in Chengxi (Jiangyin and Wuxi): News from Wuxi reports that the puppet "Magistrate" of Jiangyin, He Peixuan, strongly "resigned." Li Tingzhang has been appointed to replace him.

### American Merchant Ship "Daxin" Has Entered Gu'aotou; Hana of Harner and Moford of Ford Intend to Test the Waters; Zhejiang Provincial Government Orders Ban on Navigation to Shipu

After the Zhejiang and Fujian ports were blockaded by the Japanese navy, shipping routes were completely interrupted. Although Gu'aotou and Songmen were not included in the blockade, ships sailing to various ports were obstructed and forced to return, as reported in the newspapers. It is now known that the American merchant ship "Daxin" entered Gu'aotou the day before yesterday (21st). The ship's entry telegram has arrived in Shanghai.

Activities of Shipping Merchants

Upon hearing this news, many shipping merchants are eager to try. The German merchant ship "Hana" of the Far East Company, previously obstructed and returned to Shanghai, has unloaded its cargo and intends to sail empty to explore the situation. Yesterday, it reported to the customs for customs clearance, which was approved. It is scheduled to set sail tomorrow morning. It is rumored that the "Moford" of Reiss & Co. also has a proposal to sail. The German "Daping" of the Sino-Italian Company is still under repair and will attempt to sail once completed.

Small Ship Routes

As for the shipping route between Shanghai and various ports in eastern Zhejiang, the "Gaodeng" of the Lulun Shipping Company is scheduled to depart from Shanghai on the 24th, carrying passengers and cargo to Songmen, as well as Juexi, Nantian, and Jinqinggang. However, it was heard yesterday that there are still problems, and it has not been decided. The Italian "Anli" returned to Shanghai from Songmen the day before yesterday, but due to obstruction by Japanese warships and difficulties in cargo transportation, the voyage was delayed. Therefore, it has been decided to temporarily suspend operations. The "Lima," which sails to Cengang, is operating smoothly, with one sailing every three days. The shipping route to Dinghai, which has already fallen, is monopolized by three Japanese small ships, including the Lianfeng Maru.

Shipu Navigation Ban

Regarding Shipu, although it is not within the Japanese blockade zone, the Zhejiang Provincial Government has prohibited navigation. This ban has been telegraphed to the shipping industry in this city by the Ningbo Defense Command. The original telegram stated, "Instructed by the acting telegram of Provincial Chairman Huang Qinyong, it has been found that Shipu is a place where various red sailboats store goods. Recently, it has been repeatedly reported that prohibited items are privately transported and stored in the port. Merchants use the pretext of unclogging the interior to engage in smuggling, and able-bodied men are escaping, making it difficult to control. The difficulties in controlling materials after opening navigation have been listed in detail and telegraphed to Commander Gu for review. We have now received a telegram stating that fishing boats and cargo transportation should be handled at your discretion. It should be complied with. In addition to allowing fishing boats to continue fishing and restricting the handling of essential necessities, all wheeled steamships engaged in the business of carrying cargo should be suspended to facilitate administration and strengthen defense."

### Foreign Ships to Haiphong Suddenly Postponed; Seemingly Related to the Situation in Vietnam

According to news from foreign shipping circles, it is rumored that French Vietnam intends to accept Japanese demands, and it is feared that the situation in Vietnam will fall into a state of war. Therefore, the Taikoo Company's "Shandong" ship, originally scheduled to depart for Haiphong at dawn yesterday, has temporarily suspended its departure due to the unstable situation there. However, the Taikoo Company issued a notice yesterday, only stating that the departure has been postponed to the 25th of this month, without explaining the reason for the postponement. It was also found that the ship's suspension of departure was not requisitioned by the British authorities in this city, so it seems to be related to the situation in Vietnam. Furthermore, the French Mail Line's "Xijiang" ship, originally scheduled to set sail directly for Haiphong from Shanghai at 8:00 AM today, has been postponed to tomorrow (the 25th) at 8:30 AM due to unfinished loading, and it is said that there will be no further delays.

### Reporter Cheng Zhenzhang of the Da Mei Evening News Laid to Rest Yesterday; Colleagues Saddened by the Loss; Mourning Guests Wept

Cheng Zhenzhang, international editor of the Da Mei Evening News, was suddenly shot and killed by thugs at the intersection of West Aisi Road and Jin Shenfu Road on the morning of the 19th. Details have been reported in the newspapers. Colleagues at the Da Mei Evening News were saddened by the loss and organized a funeral committee to handle all funeral arrangements. The memorial service was held at the International Funeral Home on Jiaozhou Road at 2:00 PM yesterday. Many people from all walks of life attended to pay their respects. Wreaths of flowers sent as condolences filled the space in front of the altar. The hall was arranged with benches in a rectangular shape, surrounded by wreaths. The coffin was placed in the center, with the lid open. Mr. Cheng lay peacefully inside. After a mortician performed cosmetic procedures, he looked lifelike, with a vibrant spirit. He was wearing a white broadcloth suit, a bright red tie, and white leather shoes, looking extremely dapper. As the clock struck 2:00 PM, everyone bowed three times to the portrait amidst sobbing and mournful music, standing in silent tribute.

Life Story

Then, his close friend reported on Mr. Cheng's life story. According to him, Mr. Cheng's life can be divided into three periods. The first period, from 1930 to 1933, was his school period. After class, he gathered like-minded comrades with literary interests and founded the weekly magazines "Nahan" (Outcry) and "Lion's Roar," which were entirely composed of new, young writers. The second period, from 1933 to 1936, was his time serving at the Chen Bao newspaper. In addition to his editorial duties, he continued to learn diligently and often wrote commentaries. His colleagues admired the impartiality of his opinions. The third period was after the Chen Bao newspaper closed, when he joined the Xin Bao and, finally, the Da Mei Evening News. Unfortunately, he encountered an accident while being faithful to his duties, fulfilling a great and just mission, which makes us feel deeply saddened and inconsolable.

Viewing the Remains

After the general manager of the newspaper, Bai Luosi, led the guests to view the remains, the coffin was closed to bid farewell to Mr. Cheng forever. All those who mourned on the spot wept and lamented. Bai Luosi and his eight close friends helped carry the coffin out of the hall and into the funeral home. The most heartbreaking scene was his mother, who followed behind the coffin, weeping uncontrollably. The mother and son, who depended on each other for life, were tragically separated, creating immeasurable sadness.

### Murder Case on Route Doumer; Zhou Jinyin Shot Dead; Ambushed After Lunch at Jinjiang; Stray Bullet Injured Two Young Female Students

Yesterday at noon, a sudden assassination occurred across from the Enxiangfang on Route Doumer in the French Concession. The victim was named Zhou Jinyin, from Hangzhou, who was shot twice and died from his injuries. Stray bullets also injured two female students walking by. The following are the detailed findings of the news agency reporter:

Lunch at Jinjiang

Zhou Jinyin, also known as Shimin, 33 years old, from Hangzhou, currently resides at No. 376, Third House, in a two-story building on Jufu Road, French Concession, paying a monthly rent of 60 yuan. Zhou's wife's younger sister, siblings, and others are all in Shanghai, so he divided the building into two rooms. Zhou and his wife, Fan Huiwen (23 years old), lived in the front room, while the back room was provided for his wife's younger brother and others to rest in. This arrangement has been in place for three months. Yesterday around 10:00 AM, Zhou made an appointment with friends Han and Xu for lunch at the Jinjiang Tea Room on Hualong Road. He went with his wife, Fan. Zhou wore a light gray silk long gown and white silk shirt and pants. After lunch at Jinjiang, it was already 12:05 PM. They left together. Han had other business to attend to, so he said goodbye after leaving and headed towards Xiafei Road. Zhou, his wife, and Xu walked and talked towards Route Doumer.

(Ambushed En Route)

Unexpectedly, at this time, next to the miscellaneous goods stall by the fence across from the Enxiangfang on Route Doumer, two men and women in short clothes bought two bags of spiced beans and started eating them. They glanced at Zhou and the others passing by, suddenly pulled out pistols, and fired two shots at Zhou. One bullet hit Zhou in the head, and the other hit him in the chest. He immediately bled profusely and fell on the sidewalk across from No. 48 Route Doumer, next to Enxiangfang, barely breathing. The shooters, seeing their goal achieved, still wanted to fire another shot, but the gun jammed, and the bullet failed to fire. Zhou disregarded the danger and shouted for help. Nearby police, who had heard the gunshots, came to encircle and capture them. The shooters preemptively fired at the police, who returned fire. Fifteen or sixteen shots were fired in total. As a result, the criminals threw their guns into the wasteland inside the French military barracks and fled to the intersection of Huanlong Road, climbing over a low wall into the Gujiazhai Garden. The Western and Chinese detectives from the police station then encircled the garden for a strict search, but the criminals had already escaped without a trace.

Died from Injuries

The injured Zhou was taken to Guangci Hospital, but he died before arriving due to the severity of his injuries. However, the body was still sent to the hospital and then transferred to the Tielasi Road mortuary for examination. During the crossfire, it was lunchtime for students to return home from school, resulting in two female students from Hualong Elementary School, Xu Baogen (14 years old) and Zheng Dingjian (12 years old), being hit by stray bullets in their legs. They were also sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment. Zhou's wife, Fan Huiwen, was questioned by the police, but Zhou's friend, Xu, disappeared when the shooting started. As for the motive for the assassination, the police, after investigating the case, believe it was a vendetta and are currently conducting a strict search for the perpetrators. As for Zhou's occupation, inquiries made by the reporter to Zhou's co-residents revealed that Zhou rented the house in Fan Huiwen's name and only knew that Zhou worked at the Yihua Industrial Society on Daxilu. Another investigation revealed that Zhou was the owner of a certain printing house. (Another report) Two Chinese children were injured by stray bullets, one in the buttocks and the other in the thigh and foot. The deceased had previously opened a printing house and was now engaged in brokerage business. It is rumored that the motive for the assassination may be due to a personal feud. The pistol abandoned by the perpetrators during their escape was inspected by the police and found not to be connected to other cases.

### Dancer Chen Juanjuan Accused of Assault; Both Parties Have Reached a Settlement

Chen Juanjuan, a dancer at the Guotai Dance Hall on Yu Qiaqing Road, has a good reputation for her dancing skills. On the evening of the 9th of last month, Chen, Gu Erkang (a shareholder of the Guotai Dance Hall), and Gu Haitao (another shareholder of the Guotai Dance Hall) suddenly clashed for unknown reasons, leading to a physical fight that disrupted the order of the dance hall. Afterwards, Gu Haitao reported the incident to the Xinzha Police Station, accusing Chen Juanjuan of organizing a gang to commit violence, causing serious injuries and losing a diamond ring. After investigation by the police, an arrest warrant was issued for Chen, and Gu placed a reward advertisement in the newspaper for Chen Juanjuan's arrest, forcing Chen Juanjuan to temporarily avoid dancing. It is now learned that the case has been mediated by people and that both parties have reached an understanding, agreeing to a settlement, resolving the dispute.

### Lawsuit Over Failure to Deliver Ordered Cement; Wufu Company Sues Dingkang Firm

Chen Youqing of Wufu Company in this city ordered 1,000 bags of "Red Dragon" brand cement from Zhu Lianqing, owner of Dingkang Trading Company at No. 160, Sixth Floor, Aidoo Road, on April 24 of this year. The price was seven yuan per bag, totaling 7,000 yuan. An advance deposit of 2,000 yuan was paid, and delivery was agreed upon by May 15 of this year. However, the delivery was not made on time. At the same time, the price of cement soared to 15 yuan per bag. Wufu Company learned that the trading company had sold the ordered goods at a higher price, causing the delay in delivery. The company had already sold all the cement, and had to purchase existing stock at market price, incurring a loss of over 7,000 yuan. Having been unable to negotiate with the trading company, they hired lawyer Ma Yizhong to file a lawsuit with the Civil Division of the First Special District Court against Zhu Lianqing for failure to deliver the goods. The case was heard by Judge Tao yesterday. Both parties were represented by lawyers. After a detailed hearing, the court adjourned the hearing to another date to investigate the defendant's evidence.

### Shadow Puppet Exhibition to Support Nursery

The Shanghai YWCA, with the intention of benefiting children and families, proposed the establishment of a free childcare center for underprivileged children. The association planned and sought a location for the operation, but due to the considerable funds required, the project was delayed. Fortunately, artist Zhou Jiyuan, recently returned from elsewhere, brought over 200 shadow puppet paintings he had created. To assist the association in raising funds for the opening expenses of the childcare center, he volunteered to hold a personal shadow puppet exhibition at the YWCA hall on Jingan Temple Road. Fifty percent of the proceeds from ticket sales, after deducting expenses, will be donated to the center, and fifty percent of the proceeds from the sale of artwork will also be contributed. Shadow puppets have significant uses in Western countries, such as in advertising, graphic design, and decoration, and are widely used. However, there is little attention paid to this in our country. Now, a unique art form is being offered for the appreciation of connoisseurs, with a single-color, finely printed shadow puppet picture included with each ticket, limited to 5,000 copies.

### Large Quantity of Military Weapons Found Hidden in Gluten Workshop; Searched by Japanese Military Police; Shop Owner Zhang Chunquan on the Run

### Four Robbers Apprehended; Stolen Goods Displayed for Claim

The Chengdu Road Police Station recently apprehended four male and female robbers, who were sent to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention.

The detectives have retrieved the stolen goods, which are temporarily stored at the police station. However, the two victims have moved to another location, and their address is unknown, making it impossible for the police station to investigate. It is rumored that Chen and Xu are dancers at a certain dance hall. After seeing the news, it is hoped that they will immediately go to the detective section of the Chengdu Road Police Station to claim the stolen goods.

### South China Christian Figures Plan to Form a Children's Education Association to Establish Twenty Institutions to Accommodate 10,000 Refugee Children and Plan to Launch a Fundraising Campaign for HK$400,000

(Hong Kong dispatch) South China Christian figures have recently initiated the organization of the South China War Zone Children's Education Association to establish institutions to accommodate war-stricken children, providing them with education. The first branch has already been established in Wuzhou, accommodating one hundred refugee children. Dr. Zhou Boqin, the initiator of the association, recently departed from Wuzhou and arrived in Hong Kong, visiting Christian organizations here to jointly discuss the formation of a committee in Hong Kong to launch a fundraising campaign and establish education branches in various regions to expand accommodation.

### Gold Market Speculation Interest Decreases

Yesterday's cash gold unofficial market was lethargic and unable to recover. In addition, foreign exchange continued to ease and flatten, and operators' interest decreased. Although some buyers were constantly purchasing, most leaned towards selling. The morning opening was at $5,690. After money changers and banks sold, it immediately fell to a low of $5,658. Later, gold firms and securities houses took the opportunity to carry in, and it returned to $5,692. The noon closing was at $5,677. The afternoon market initially was extremely flat, opening at $5,675, then falling another $5. Later, due to sudden purchases from the Hong Kong gang and panic buying from retail investors, the price rose to $5,695. Although short sellers from the gold firms came out one after another, the buying interest was still good at this time, and the evening closing was also at $5,680, down slightly by $15 from the previous day. The total daily transaction volume was still strong, with over 2,500 taels. Gold jewelry prices ultimately remained unchanged, and customs duties remained flat.

Gold Fell $15 Since Morning Every Bar (Ten Taels), initially with slightly weary sentiment, the market opened with a decrease of $5, with gold firms selling securities houses ten taels, for $5,690. Then, due to competition between gold firms and money changers to sell, the trend was soft, falling another $32. Gold firms sold gold firms ten taels, lower at $5,658. Then, relying on securities houses and gold firms to buy in, and retail investors also seizing the opportunity to drag in cheaply, the market trend changed from weary to stable, rising to $5,692. Later, the money changers returned to sell, and buyers hesitated, and before the closing, it dropped to $5,667 again. However, the closing relied on the gold firms to pull up, and there was still $5,677. The initial afternoon market was flat and weary, opening with a decrease of $2, with gold firms mutually trading, for $5,675. Then, due to money changers selling, it fell another $5, with money changers selling gold firms ten taels, retreating to $5,670. Later, fortunately, retail investors bought in, and the Hong Kong gang also suddenly dragged in, and before long, it soared to $5,695. Afterwards, the price fell again by more than $10, as gold firms' long positions came out. Money changers sold gold firms twenty taels, for $5,680 as the evening closing price. As a result, it was down slightly by $15 from the previous day, with only a fluctuation of $37 throughout the day. The cash price of gold firms and the selling price of proprietary gold are higher by about a dozen dollars than gold, and the purchase price is reduced by $30. The current mark price is more than $50 lower than the listed price of proprietary gold, and there is little trading.

### Another Blow to Those Who Like to Collect Foreign Currency The British Pound Note Plunged Yesterday

In order to prevent British currency from falling into the hands of the Germans and to exchange British exchange, yesterday each newspaper published the British Embassy's announcement of a plan to prohibit the import of Bank of England notes into the United Kingdom. Because of the complicated procedures for sending banknotes to the UK in this city and the need to bear the risk of postal delivery en route, the market has changed. The initial opening price was $53. Because more sellers emerged and buyers hesitated, most stopped buying and selling. There was a market without goods. However, some banks still had trading. After the afternoon closing, some banks' buying prices were calling $48, although not the official market, falling $6-7 compared to the 22nd. The exchange rate for British exchange yesterday was $3 pence 7/32 (70.3125), and each pound was worth $64.81 in legal tender, while the price of each British gold note was $48. The difference between the two was $16.81 per pound, that is, the British gold note was only worth 74% of the British exchange. Since this incident occurred, it has caused another blow to those in Shanghai who like to collect foreign currency. With the situation so unstable, the future fate of various foreign currencies is also unknown. So those who hold foreign currency are worried again. (British)

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw slightly small rotations in gold, and British and American gold pounds were also fatigued. The British gold note continued to plunge by $3.40 under certain rumors, calculated at $51.60, and each party had a rare need, while the supply was quite abundant, resulting in more emptiness. The American gold note revolved within a small range, and finally fell by one cent, to $17.73. Hong Kong notes were fairly balanced in supply and demand, and the market price was stable. Japanese gold notes and Korean notes are still rising, with the former at $1.455 and the latter at $1.085.

### Securities Domestic Debt Floating and Grasping Uncertainty After a Sharp Rise, a Small Correction is Seen Foreign Stocks Rise Universally

The stock market yesterday saw a large number of long positions released by big players, and the market price shifted from stable to falling. The reason is the uncertainty of the floating long positions. As soon as the market situation softened slightly, they immediately let go to seek evening. There was absolutely no change in the environment. Market rumors are intentionally spread by a very small number of long and short positions without awareness in order to profit themselves, which is not worth knowing. A smile from a knowledgeable person is enough. A sharp rise with a small correction is an intended matter. The market was very stable at the initial opening yesterday, and not smaller than the day before yesterday's price. Jiufeng's short covering was very lively, but since Xinfu's long positions emerged very strongly, the price could not support it. Hongda, Yongkang, Wuyuan, and each house followed the wind. Although Hengkang, Lianyi, and Hongkang absorbed, they failed to stand firm. The morning saw a decrease of 23-30 cents. In the afternoon, Jiufeng continued to enter, Hongda also turned from selling to buying, and Lianhe also had absorption. Sixth Place had a very strong appetite, Hengkang continued to enter, Xinfu's long positions continued to emerge, Yitai and Tongkang added codes, Yongfeng and Defu drifted with the tide. Retail long positions also sold out one after another, and the market price saw exhaustion. As a result, it fell by 35-75 cents. Throughout the day, Hengkang's purchase of nearly 300,000 was most notable, because it had sold at a high price the day before yesterday, and now it has returned. The total transaction volume was more than one million yuan. A brief table is listed below:

Stock Trading The transaction of 20 shares of Dasheng No. 1 Factory stock, the price is 14 yuan.

The Shanghai Stock Exchange continued to be firm and bullish, and the prices of each stock continued to increase and rise, with very little turning back. Regarding the weekend settlement as nothing, so almost no stock did not rise. Rubber stocks are the most popular, and the amount of transactions is huge, which has not been seen for a long time in the simple morning trading process. It is very difficult to list the rising stocks individually, because the firmness of the market situation is too universal. Whether this kind of vigorous trend can be continued remains to be proven by the facts next week.

London, 23rd (Thursday) The listed prices of Chinese foreign debt and Far East British merchant companies' stocks today are still flat and sluggish. Only HSBC Hong Kong Registered Stock rose by half a pound, with the price at 68.5 pounds. English registration was unchanged, and there were no other changes.

### Cotton Yarn Distant Covering Yarn Market Recovers

After the yarn market began to stabilize, the trend slightly increased. This is because it has been rotating for a long time without falling, causing some speculators' minds to move, and they came to absorb a few packages. At the same time, for the futures to be withdrawn in September, because of profitability, they also came to compensate, so the people's hearts were shaken, and the market has recovered. However, the actual sales channel is still narrow, and the inventory is still thick, and has not been reduced. The fundamental problem must rely on consumption as the first priority. The September futures price initially made $924, then $934.

The spot market opened flat in the morning, with a gentle situation. The opening price of 20-count Double Horse was $926, not much different from the previous day. Once this market opened, there was very little change, and everyone looked at each other and did not move. Therefore, it rotated for a long time. By the time of closing, it was slightly rising, because short positions were entered into September, and people's hearts were lifted. The closing price of 20-count Double Horse was $926.5, and after that it was made to $932. The half-day transaction statistics totaled 1,790 packages. The market for 10-count Double Horse rose by $3.5. Today, 380 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Yantai, and 60 pieces were shipped to Tianjin. Yesterday, there were also 947 pieces shipped to Yantai and 537 pieces shipped to Hong Kong. The amount purchased by each gang is listed as follows:

Peer 1,520 Hong Kong 185 Wenzhou 50

Inland 125 Statistics 1,790

### Spot Cotton Trading Scattered

The spot cotton situation has shown a slight improvement, but factories are still not absorbing it in bulk. Only sporadic replenishment transactions of raw cotton occur occasionally and on a small scale, so prices are slightly firm. As for the business of fellow traders settling previous transactions, it is relatively large. The price of Fire Machine Brand cotton and grassy bales is 154 yuan, white bales are at 160 yuan, and good quality Tongzhou cotton is priced at 180 yuan. Generally speaking, the cotton market is also on the horizontal line. The biggest factor is that new cotton will soon be on the market. The weather has been dry recently, and the harvest season is earlier than in previous years. Therefore, all parties are temporarily taking a wait-and-see approach.

In other news, the price of foreign cotton: the New York cotton market is once again quiet, as there is a lack of buyers in the market, and at the same time, some large positions are being closed out. As a result, the closing price fell by four or five points compared to the previous day. The Indian cotton market fell by more than one rupee yesterday, including forecasts.

The trading of foreign cotton in Shanghai has been slightly relaxed in recent days. Japanese manufacturers have slightly increased their purchases, but the quantity is not large. As fellow traders are well aware of the scarcity of spot goods on the market and the infrequency of ship arrivals, they are quite keen to purchase. Although few transactions have been made, the sentiment is exceptionally firm.

### Piece Goods: Can AoJiang Be Navigated? The Key to Sales of Chinese-Made Cloth

Domestically produced cloth: The market situation was calm yesterday, with sales channels being too narrow and speculators being inactive. However, holders of goods are maintaining a calm attitude. The decision of the Hana Maru to resume sailing to AoJiang has a significant impact on the future of the cloth market. There was little change in cloth prices yesterday. Small amounts of hand goods fell by 1 to 2.5 jiao per piece. The local street handled more than 20,000 pieces of satin, tricotine, velvet, and various grey fabrics, more than 200 pieces of coarse cloth, colored cloth, and printed goods, more than 200 pieces of colored cloth, twill, and other goods handled by Guangdong and Hong Kong merchants, and more than 100 pieces of coarse cloth and printed cloth handled by the Yantai merchants in the north.

Eastern Cloth: The morning was flat, but the afternoon saw a rise, with a firm trend. White goods, especially long-staple fine cloth, hovered around 30 yuan 8 or 9 jiao in the morning, and the highest closing price in the afternoon was 31 yuan 1 jiao 5 fen. The "Four Gentlemen" serge rose to 9 jiao 1 fen 2.5 li. Although not many transactions were made, the market atmosphere was very tight.

Exports: Cotton cloth, yesterday (the 23rd), totaled 457 pieces, shipped to Yantai, and another 517 pieces shipped to Hong Kong. Today, there are 40 pieces to Tianjin and another 820 pieces to Yantai.

### Grain: More Foreign Rice Arrives, Sales Are Flat

Sales of foreign rice were weak again yesterday. The local street has special sales arrangements, and long-term customers are satisfied. Mainland merchants have not been able to solve the transportation problems, so they have not continued to buy. Therefore, the market immediately fell by half a yuan after opening. Although there were scattered purchases by rural households and mainlanders in the later market, the final result was still weak. Grade 1 old Saigon was 59 yuan, 58 yuan 7 jiao, new superior was 57 yuan 2 jiao, 57 yuan, Grade 2 No. 1 was 53 yuan 8 jiao, Grade 1 Siam was 58 yuan 5 jiao, Grade 2 was 53 yuan, 52 yuan 6 jiao, fire-milled was 58 yuan, 57 yuan, Hong Kong superior was 57 yuan 3 jiao, 55 yuan, Jue was 52 yuan 5 jiao, small-milled was 53 yuan 2 jiao, 53, Tokyo polished superior was 48 yuan 5 jiao, 48 yuan, rough superior was 47 yuan 5 jiao, 47 yuan, broken superior was 43, 4 yuan, rice tea was 45 yuan 7 jiao, 45 yuan. Returned original packages were in oversupply. Grade 2 Siam fell slightly from 63 yuan to 62 yuan 5 jiao, down one yuan from the previous day. Grade 2 Saigon also fell from 63 yuan to 62 yuan 5 jiao, down half a yuan. However, rice tea had local sales, and the price opened at 55 yuan 5 jiao, which was half a yuan better. A total of 220 tons were sold, while only 40 bags of existing rice were sold.

A large batch of foreign rice arrived in Shanghai yesterday, totaling 16,301 bags, shipped directly from Saigon by the Randi, managed by Shun Heng Foreign Firm. It arrived at the port yesterday afternoon and is currently docked at the Bund Observatory Wharf in the French Concession for unloading.

Only six or seven hundred bags of japonica and glutinous domestic rice arrived, and trading in the open and closed markets was reportedly flat. Therefore, supply and demand were similar, and the selling price remained unchanged, with no significant gains or losses.

The number of new Zhoupu japonica rice arriving at the port was still small, only 24 dan. The morning market was weak due to the weakness of other goods, but it soon recovered, so the initial price was 62 yuan, 61 yuan 3 jiao, but the final price for special quality was still 63 yuan.

### Japanese Flour First Flat, Then Firm; Wheat Market Mixed

Yesterday's flour transactions were still dominated by Japanese factory flour, because although Chinese factory flour, Fuxin and old brand, were supplied, the quantity was very small. General speculators mostly focused on trading Phoenix brand futures. The market opened flat, but as shorts covered their positions and there were slight sales of existing flour, the price rose by several fen to 1.5 jiao. The price for this month was 14 yuan 3 jiao to 3 jiao 5 fen, and the prices for September and October were 14 yuan 5 jiao 5 fen and 14 yuan 7 jiao, respectively. A total of more than 7,000 bags were traded. The price for Chinese factory flour was still 15 yuan, and 3,000 bags were traded. There were few transactions of other flours, and the market was flat. In addition, 1,500 bags of flour were shipped to Tianjin yesterday.

The new wheat market was relatively stable yesterday, with most owners unwilling to sell easily. However, there were also some small-scale vendors secretly selling at a lower price, so the market was slightly mixed. It was reported that three or four thousand bags of goods were delivered to the factory, but the selling price was not finalized. The purchasing price of Chinese factories was still around 13 yuan, and five or six hundred bags of Gao Du wheat were purchased.

300 bags of corn were shipped to Weihaiwei today.

### Sugar Market: 8,000 Bags of Refined White Sugar Opened

### Dried Fruits and Nuts: New Longans Continue to Fall

The arrival of new Hainan longans has increased, and the market continues to soften. However, this year's output is higher than last year's, so it is impossible to hold on and not sell. Therefore, the northern and southern market firms have opened up as scheduled yesterday, with the higher price being 130 yuan, and the decided price being slightly reduced. It is reported that the market price in Hong Kong is better than in Shanghai, so the source of supply may decrease in the future, and the market may benefit from this turnaround.

### Seafood: Guanli Shrimp Tails from Yantai Presented Fresh

The first batch of new Guanli shrimp tails from Yantai, six boxes, arrived, with excellent color, but unfortunately the shrimp were very small, so it was difficult to sell at a high price. Yesterday, they opened at 287 yuan. It is reported that more will arrive in the coming days.

### Miscellaneous: Cigarette Factory Production Is Insufficient

The price of cigarettes in the unofficial market has been rising steadily in recent days, because the factory's shipments are not smooth and sales in various places are quite strong, resulting in tight market conditions. Yesterday, the market price of the Great Britain brand was 1,082 yuan, the Old Knife brand was 794 yuan, the Little Fairy was 525 yuan, and the Five Flowers brand was 514 yuan. The price of the Little Champagne brand produced by the Great Eastern Company rose by 25 yuan due to foreign exchange factors, and the new price was 471 yuan.

Excerpts from Old News, 67 Years Ago (485) (See this newspaper from the 12th year of the Tongzhi era of the defunct Qing Dynasty)

### Humorous Anecdotes upon Receiving News

In Suzhou, during the years of the provincial examinations, all ships receiving news from various prefectures are moored near Tong Bridge in Shantang. The students often linger by the bridge on the day of the announcement, hoping for good news. A certain student told a story of receiving news, which is both amusing and cautionary! It is said that in a certain department of a certain province in a certain subject, hundreds of people went to the examination. After the announcement, they all went outside the city to look at the news boats. From afar, they heard the sound of gongs resounding. Soon they saw the yellow flag of receiving news being hoisted high. With two oars and double paddles, the boat was as fast as an arrow. As it approached the city, the students stood on both banks, craning their necks and waving their hands, anxiously asking for news. They saw an old doorman standing precariously at the bow of the boat, shaking his spirit, ringing the gong endlessly. Looking around, seeing the students eagerly inquiring, he stopped ringing the gong, raised his voice, and said to the crowd: "Gentlemen, you usually use taverns as study rooms, opium dens as schools, brothels as examination halls, and gambling dens as examination sites. You do not read poetry or study literature. This year's list has people from every prefecture and every county, except for this place of mine, where there is not a single one. All have fallen into the vast ocean! I was hoping to bring good news and earn some silver, but now I have wasted my effort and lost my time. Where can I be compensated? I ask you, gentlemen, do you have face or no face!" After saying this, he threw the gong with one hand and the hammer with the other, sighed deeply, and went into the cabin. The students knew that they had failed, and had no time to argue with him. They all lowered their heads and went home dejectedly. It is said that in the next examination, the number of those who passed from that department was twice as many as in other places.

Free Talk

### Free Talk, Thirtieth Year

— The Editor

Starting today, Free Talk enters its thirtieth year.

Among the supplements of various Chinese newspapers, Free Talk can be considered one of the most historically long-lived. When we bring out and look at old newspapers from around the birth of the Republic of China, we seem to be reading the history of the Republic of China. We see the giant wheels of the era turning, we see the revolutionary currents of thought gestating, we see the new China growing longer. And Free Talk was founded at this time. (August 24, 1911)

Many young readers may not have the opportunity to see the face of Free Talk in its early years. We specially, at the beginning of the thirtieth year, select a portion from each stage and republish it as a small commemoration.

These short articles have all left traces and had an effect in the minds of the previous generation.

July 1st of the Xinhai Year (August 24, 1911)

### ### Generous and Tragic Song: Yue Wumu's Poetry and Lyrics

Song Yue Wumu's "Manjianghong" lyrics. Generous and impassioned. Many people recite it. But they do not know that many of his poems and lyrics are also worth passing down. Such as "Sending Mr. Ziyan Zhang on the Northern Expedition" says: "Commands are swift as wind and thunder. The voice of heaven shakes the northern frontier. Charge straight into Henan and Luoyang. Strike directly towards Yan and You. Horses trample the blood of the princesses. Banners behead the heads of the Khans. Return to report to the wise ruler. Restore the old Divine Land." Eulogy for Mr. Shizhai says: "It has been thirty years since the southward crossing. How many of the robes and hats remain today? Heartbroken at the loss of the old guards. Turning my head to look at the Central Plains. Leaving the country due to the power of treacherous officials. Preserving my body thanks to the grace of the sage ruler. Bringing about the days of Yao and Shun for the ruler. Sincere intentions entrusted to humble words." Sending to the Buddhist monk Huikai says: "How many autumns at Wenpu and Mount Lu? The Yangtze River twists and turns towards the east. A man should aspire to support the royal family. The sage ruler personally leads the campaign to eliminate the barbarian chiefs. The achievements must be engraved on the Yanshan stone. Retirement will ultimately accompany Chisong. Please convey my words to the old man of Donglin. The Lotus Society should from now on focus on cultivation." Inscription on Juma Ridge says: "Standing on the Lin Ridge, my eyes open to the battlefield. Where the battle clouds open, a stream flows. The water of Ji Spring is still said to be Jin's. In whose palace is the Shu millet flourishing, who mourns for Zhou? The southern lands are only small clowns. When will the northern chariots return to the Divine Land? I vow to repay the wise ruler with my seven-foot body. Angrily pointing to the horizon, my tears cannot be contained." Inscription on the wall of Guichi Zhai Mountain says: "In recent years, dust has filled my battle clothes. Leisurely humming, I climb the emerald green. Good waters and good mountains cannot be seen enough. Horse hooves urge me to return in the bright moonlight." The "Little Heavy Mountain" lyrics say: "Last night, the cold crickets kept chirping. Startling me from a thousand-mile dream. It's already the third watch. I get up and walk around the steps alone. People are quiet, and the moonlight outside the curtain is hazy. My white head is for fame. The old pines and bamboos of my old mountain are old. Blocking my journey home. I want to entrust my thoughts to the Yaoqin. Few understand my music. Who will listen when the strings are broken?"

### Playful Writing: New Little Fool

— Wang Xilin

The current situation. Is terrifying to speak of. Gangsters and bandits. Murdering and arson. Thugs and local tyrants. Violating women. Guangdong floods. Hangzhou fire. Foreign party members. Rejoicing in misfortune. Taking this opportunity. Acting recklessly. Generals of various provinces. Blocking at every turn. European war. Affecting the Middle Kingdom. Ships of various countries.

Forced to take dangerous roads. More and more robbers. The residents are more bitter. Some friends. Confused. Public welfare matters. Not one thing is done. Calling friends and gathering. Mahjong. Same character, one color. Really hard to do. At least three tables. Ninety-six wins. Dealer self-draws. Do you want to bury the tiger? Eat watermelon. Smell fragrant. Mahjong finished. Six o'clock past. Sitting at a table. Big and small wives. There is soup and stir-fry. There is meat and vegetables. Talking and talking. Mentioning the current situation. Living in the countryside. Feeling inappropriate. Thinking of Shanghai. Immortal fairyland. Calling a boat overnight. Steamboat drags. Dragged to the concession. The mansion is big. Watch new plays. Ride in cars.

### Free Talk's Free Talk, Preparing for Peace

August 23, Year 4 of the Republic

— Juemi

What makes our people uneasy today. A difficult livelihood. Is also a major reason. Although the government today has a People's Livelihood Association. Regarding our people's livelihood. What kind of benefits are there? This is unknowable. Therefore, what our people urgently need to plan for today. Is the matter of livelihood.

August 24, Year 5 of the Republic

— Chen Meng

The current stamp. The glue on the back. Has absolutely no glutinous properties. Often, after being pasted for several days. It will fall off unconsciously. If found by an investigator. Will inevitably be severely punished. It is advisable to use zongzi to stick it. To avoid this problem. All rental documents for renting a house. And silver money account books. Should be affixed with two-cent stamps. (Should be purchased from the local post office.) Immediately after posting, stamp the corner. If I check it out. Will be severely punished. Households and shops. Must know.

August 24, Year 9 of the Republic

— Changshou Ren

Recently, Free Talk has published many secrets. The reporter also has several secrets. Dare not keep it secret. Publish it to the world.

Secrets to curing diseases. In recent times, incompetent doctors treat people's diseases. Often there is a problem of medicine not matching the symptoms. I now think of the safest way. It is better for the doctor to prescribe a prescription in advance. Making people get sick according to the prescription. Perhaps the medicine will cure the disease. Absolutely no mistakes.

### Free Talk

### Free Talk: Three Words and Two Phrases

August 23, Year 14 of the Republic

I was just saying that there's nothing to see in the student movement. It's better to be calm. Wait until August 18th to watch the Qiantang tide in Shanghai. But I didn't expect the student movement at Beijing Women's Normal University to escalate even higher. Many female students were injured. Heads were broken and bleeding. Had to go to the hospital. It's lucky that no one was killed this time. Otherwise, the student dormitory would be a sea of blood. What would that be? It seems that in the future, fathers and elder brothers who send their children to school. Must hire bodyguards for them. At least, they must buy insurance from an insurance company to avoid paying a whole sum of tuition fees. If they are beaten to death, they will have to pay for funeral expenses.

### Recording the Collection of the Heroine Qiu Jin

August 23, Year 17 of the Republic

— Jiyang

Thoughts in the Yellow Sea Boat: Hearing this, the place where the fierce battle took place that year. Still bearing traces of blood. Rushing and driving the horses, the dream of the Central Plains. Broken rivers and mountains, shame of the old country. Grieving for the lack of authority over the territorial waters. Sharpening the knife, eager to think of revenge. The heavenly wind blows coldly on my face. A hundred thousand clouds and smoke in my eyes.

Feelings of Anger: A vast and desolate Divine Land, sighing and sinking. Ashamed of being born as a teacher, with no plans to teach. Vowing to seize sand to revive the Chu. Striking Qin with no hammer. Knowing that the people are cheap when the country is broken. The righteousness is high, not hindering the poverty of the traveler's bag. Hating that the business has not repaid the comrades. Holding the sword, singing sadly, tears flowing horizontally.

### Various Donation Ranks

August 26, Year 22 of the Republic

— Luowen

In the mid-Qing Dynasty, one could become an official by donating money. Those were called the "donation ranks." The young masters of wealthy families, with oily hair and shiny faces, would suddenly be busy for a few days. They would have a small crystal bead on their heads, sometimes with an old feather, speaking official language, saying, "The weather is good today."

By the Republic of China, it was supposed that donating for official positions was gone. But in reality, the path of donating for ranks was opened up even more. Even "scholars and literati" could obtain official hats through this method. The first chapter of the founding principle was naturally to have money. As long as you have money, everything is easy. For example, if you want to donate to become a scholar, you can buy a batch of antiques, get to know a few French guests, and hire a few workers to rub out the patterns and words on the antiques, print them into a book using glass plates, and call it "Collected Antiquities" or "Archaeological Records." Li Fusun made a "Record of Epigraphy," which was exclusively for people who studied epigraphy. But this became a "precedent," allowing French guests to continue and expand on it, even including young masters and merchants who collect and sell antiques. This was called "epigraphers."

Donating to become a "writer" also doesn't require new tricks. Just open a bookstore, pull in a few writers, hire some idle helpers, and publish a small newspaper. You must also be able to say "The weather is good today," write it down, print it, and give it to the newspaper vendors. In less than a year or two, success is guaranteed. But the rubbings of patterns and words from antiques cannot be used. They should be replaced with photos of movie stars and modern women, because this is the art of the new era. There are still many people in China who "love beauty," and "writers" or "artists" arise in this way.

Donating for an official position can hope to make a profit by plundering the people. But donating for scholars and literati won't result in a loss either. Printed materials can certainly be sold for cash, and foreigners will be willing to pay high prices for antiques in the future.

This is also called "gaining both fame and wealth." But first, you need to be able to "invest." So ordinary people can't do it. Otherwise, scholars and literati wouldn't be worth much.

But they are still worth money now, so people are still busy making biographical dictionaries, writing literary histories, publishing essays on writers, and compiling autobiographies. I think that if you are writing a historical work, you should divide writers into Romantic, Classical, and a separate "Donation Rank" school. History should be "true," and it's okay to offend some people, isn't it?

### Imperturbability

August 3, Year 28 of the Republic

— Yu

Hearing bad news, we naturally furrow our brows and grit our teeth; similarly, hearing good news, we can't help but nod and give a knowing smile. Humans are emotional animals, and it is only natural to have these expressions when our emotions are affected by hateful or joyful things.

However, I believe that our usual expressions of emotion are casual, and in this extraordinary era, they are not appropriate and not enough.

From the beginning, we have known the arduousness of our responsibility, and we have long been determined to achieve our goals, regardless of how the environment changes, with unyielding persistence. Therefore, any external news, whether bad or good, we really have no reason to be emotional other than to pay close attention and use it as a reference. Moreover, expressions of hatred often lead to frustration, while expressions of joy often lead to laziness. It is inevitable that frustration leads to a decline in ambition, and laziness leads to a dissipation of spirit. We absolutely do not need that!

Imperturbability is what our wise predecessors called不动心 (bù dòng xīn), "not moving the heart." This is a skill that all great figures throughout history have had to cultivate. We people of today are certainly not all great figures, but we are the descendants of the Yellow Emperor, the favored children of heaven. We dare not belittle ourselves. We are citizens of a great country, and at this critical moment of survival, everyone should maintain imperturbability.

We are by no means cold and heartless. In fact, our emotions are completely entrusted to our country and nation, and have already exceeded the scope of ordinary emotions. If we still cannot help but furrow our brows in hatred and smile in joy, we must redouble our efforts beyond these smiles and frowns to fully express our emotions.

Until this full expression of our emotions is achieved, we can only maintain imperturbability. And we should know that, apart from our barbarians, the actions of other friends, although sometimes unfavorable to us, seem not to help us, are mostly for their own benefit, not because they harbor resentment against us; similarly, apart from ourselves, although they sometimes benefit us, seem to help us, it is often for their own benefit, not necessarily because they love us. So, why should we hate and rejoice because of them?

泰山崩于前而色不变; 麋鹿兴于左而目不瞬 (Tàishān bēng yú qián ér sè bù biàn; mílù xīng yú zuǒ ér mù bù shùn) - "The Taishan Mountain collapses in front of you, but your expression does not change; a deer appears on the left, but you do not blink an eye." We must have this kind of imperturbability, and only look at the goal and run straight ahead! Otherwise, in the future, bad news or good news will continue to come, and we will only have emotional impulses, what else can we do?

### Imperturbability

August 17, Year 23 of the Republic

It's not surprising that, in summer, gentlemen who care about the world and the people suddenly intensify their emphasis on the "defense" between men and women? Women's clothing in summer is really too provocative, and the focus of "provocation" is that too much of the physical body is exposed. Therefore, the official document banning women from showing their legs and feet is a proud work that hits the topic accurately.

When our ancestors lived a "barbaric" life in the mountains and forests, they had no clothes to cover their bodies. Everyone was used to seeing each other naked and didn't feel anything. However, this is precisely why barbarians are considered superficial. "Civilized people" have much more complex minds and emphasize "subtlety" and "having no end in sight." From this, "association" is particularly developed. Seeing a small, exposed leg makes them feel a little something. In fact, a leg is just a leg, far less expressive than eyebrows that can speak and eyes that can "send flirtation." Speaking of this, one can't help but admire the way Turkish women used to wear veils when going out, as that was truly thorough.

As for exposing legs and applying oil and powder, or painting red toenails when barefoot, changing from seeking convenience and coolness to wanting to be troublesome and look good—that is even more shocking. Of course, these legs with oil and powder are probably only a small part of the bare legs. Their purpose is completely different from ordinary bare legs. Not only should they not be allowed to "shine," but they might as well be thrown into a coal kiln. What a pity is that these legs mostly sit in cars, and law-abiding police officers can only look at them.

Looking at it from the other side, the leg owners go to the trouble of applying oil and powder simply to look good. Making the legs look good is not for their own appreciation, but because the male society that seizes power and prohibits bare legs needs this kind of decoration. It is said that there used to be female-centered societies. At that time, did men deliberately dress up like women do now? We are not very clear, but Wu Jingzi gave us an answer in "Flowers in the Mirror." Even men with big black beards in the Daughter Kingdom still have to apply rouge and powder. However, when gentlemen who care about the world and the people read "Flowers in the Mirror" to this part, they are unwilling to close the book and think about it.

### Simplification

October 10, Year 27 of the Republic

— Baiwu

Being able to simplify is naturally very good. Because being simple allows one to settle. "Only when settled can one be calm, only when calm can one be at peace, only when at peace can one deliberate, and only when one deliberates can one gain!" Thus, those who advocate "simplification" have "gained" something.

However, "gain" is sometimes not enough to compensate for "loss," which is also very clear. For example, someone said this:

"In any case, if countries can still use non-interference to advise China and Japan to mediate, this may simplify things."

Why should countries "not interfere"? Yet why should they "advise"? For humanity? For justice? For human culture? However, in the face of humanity, justice, and human culture, there should be clear right and wrong, and passionate likes and dislikes. Not "non-interference," not "advising," but "aiding" the aggressed, as decided by the League of Nations!

This way, things are not simplified, because the fighting will continue.

Originally, it wasn't simple: the war of aggression and the war of anti-aggression, this relationship is international. The American Revolutionary War was not only American, but international, because it was a victory for justice and humanity, and humanity can be called humanity from then on. Only by incorporating all the laws of historical evolution into the personal or minority group's gains, can things naturally be simplified? This is to let China be a colony forever, and to let the aggressors be "imperialists" forever. Humans as knives and cutting boards, I am the fish, how simple!

However, everyone knows Sima Zhao's intentions! The majority of the Chinese people will not be deceived forever!

### The Whereabouts of the Dance Queen

Written by Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter Five: Bad News

Shi Gui interjected, "What to get? I'll get it for you."

I shook my head and went straight upstairs. What I took was mainly a small black steel pistol, as well as rulers, pieces of paper, and other useful items. Because the person we were looking for at the moment was carrying a pistol, I naturally had to be prepared. A minute later, I followed Ni Jinshou into his car. Ni Jinshou had a separate chauffeur, and I sat side by side with him in the car, feeling very comfortable. After the car started, I asked him if he had any other information on the investigation. He briefly replied a few sentences.

He said, "I went to the Yangtze Hotel and asked about the banker Lu Jiansheng's whereabouts last night. He's a regular customer there, and the staff all know him, but he wasn't there last night."

I said, "Jinmei said that Lu Jiansheng called Wang Lilanzhi's house today to ask about it. He claimed that he was playing cards at the Yangtze Hotel all night and only found out about the tragic news when he got home at dawn."

"Yes, Mr. Huo, because of this, specially asked me to inquire about it when we parted. But he really wasn't there last night."

"So, why did he lie? This person is also a bit suspicious."

Ni Jinshou hesitated for a moment and slowly replied, "However, this point alone doesn't count for anything. There are many people who are more suspicious than him right now. We shouldn't just put him on the list of suspects."

I was silent for a moment, feeling that Ni Jinshou was indeed somewhat apprehensive about this banker, and I naturally didn't want to continue this topic. (85)

### Casual Talk about the Beautiful Names of Movie Stars

— Feng

Currently, among the names of several female stars in our country, the most exquisite in terms of meaning is Chen Yanyan, and the most generous is Gu Lanjun. This is because the names of both of them transcend the ordinary range of naming with red fragrance and green jade, and form their own unique fragrance. According to the dictionary, "Yanyan" is a reduplicated word for "swallow" (Book of Songs). "Swallows flying," ancient people often used orioles and swallows to represent beauty, which is that meaning. Moreover, there is "Yingying" in ancient times, and "Yanyan" now, the two words echo each other interestingly. The word "Lanjun" means "orchid," which is the name of a fragrant herb. Ancient people used it as an adornment because of its clear and distant fragrance. "Jun" is an honorific title, a wife calls her husband (Ancient Yuefu, "Seventeen is the wife of Jun.") A husband calls his wife (Han Shu, "Returning relics to Xijun.") Both are called "Jun," and there are also titles called "Jun," such as Lord Mengchang and Lord Chunshen. The ancient people also called women's titles "Jun," so using "Lanjun" as a name not only indicates that the beauty is a fragrant herb, different from ordinary grass, but also has the meaning of comparing oneself to ancient people and bestowing glory, which is so elegant and generous. Next, Bai Hong uses the single word "Hong" as her name. Light and energy change into "Hong," dividing into various colors, which is very beautiful. Therefore, naming it "Hong" is also a new rhyme and meaningful. This has the same effect as Zhou Xuan's "Xuanji" named with the word "Xuan". Chen Yunshang's "Yunshang" does not mean "Yunshang Xiapei," belonging to the category of Chang'e the fairy, not something in the human world. Zhou Manhua's "Manhua" has two meanings, "Man" has the meanings of "light and fine" and "slender," and "Hua" can be interpreted as beautiful, which is the same as Wang Xichun, Yuan Meiyun, etc., not breaking the stereotype. Most strange is Zhang Cuihong's "Cuihong", "Cui" means emerald bird, emerald jade, all blue-green colors are called "Cui", both "Cui" and "Hong", what color is this? Checking the dictionary, the tail meat is called "Cui" (Book of Rites, Shuyan Cui). One item, then her "Cui" is interpreted as tail meat, but there is the word "Hong" below, which seems even more wrong, it is not as good as Li Hong using a single word "Hong", which can be interpreted as her red-purple red, or it can be interpreted as her being favored and popular, it feels more straightforward and without grammatical errors, which is much better than Cuihong.

### Group of Heroes Society Volunteer Performance Record

— Sick Dove

The Qunying Lianhuan Society of this city raised educational funds for the Shishi Elementary School. On the 21st night, a Peking opera rehearsal was held at the Carlton Theatre, with many famous amateurs participating. When the writer arrived at the hospital at nine o'clock, Rong Baojin and Yu Nianci's "Killing the Family by Fishing" had just taken the stage. Although Mr. Rong's Xiao En's voice felt deep and dull, his acting was quite experienced. Paired with the teacher at Yuezhi, improvising funny lines, clever words were like pearls, he was also a comedic talent. It was determined to be Wang Xiaying's "June Snow," with Gai Sanxing's actor playing the old woman. Gai Ling has accompanied famous Beijing Chao-style actors in this play at the Golden Stage many times, an experienced craftsman, naturally extraordinary. Miss Wang's Bao'e has a calm appearance and light steps, which is very much in line with the Qing Yi rules. The skill of the water sleeves has not reached the degree of beauty, the expression on her face is extremely expressive. The opening Yaoban is appropriately modulated, and the slow board of the large segment is sung intermittently, as if weeping and complaining. The tone is purely based on the steep and dangerous to win, deeply obtaining the method of taking and releasing, indulging and capturing. The use of the Cheng cavity combines the Mei flavor, which is due to the guidance of Li Qinxian. In the Fa Court scene, Shi'e's face is not painted with oil, only covered with hair, which is the case for many Kun Dan (female roles) nowadays, which invisibly reduces the terrifying atmosphere. The white speech of "up to the sky there is no way, down to the earth there is no door" is desolate and sad, and it is quite difficult to express it with a soothing and exciting tone. I still remember Zhu Chen performing this, her eyes stopping, her body leaning, making a state of coma, the tragic situation, there is no Kun Dan who has surpassed this. The second half of the Anti-Erhhuang is related to the inner Qi, not seeing the wonderful, the reverse tune is three tones higher than the positive tune, it is not easy to please if you have a good voice, and the insider sees it as a daunting task, how can you deeply blame the amateur actors! The finale "Yellow Crane Tower", Hua Zhenya's Liu Bei, Zhan Xiaoshan's Zhao Yun, Cui Dixian's Zhou Yu, and Zhang Zhesheng's Zhang Fei, are evenly matched and commensurate. Hua Zhenya is famous for his Qipai old Sheng at the time, and is as famous as Zhang Zhongyuan, so every move has a sense of proportion, which cannot be achieved without skill. Cui Dixian is an outstanding talent among amateur young actors. He can perform "Yaguan Tower" and "Eight Hammers" with a single pick, so he acts with ease, without effort, and naturally wonderfully. Zhang Zhesheng's voice is loud and vast, like a yellow bell and a great bell, a Jin Shaoshan in the amateur world. It is a pity that it was late and he did not bring a water battle.
