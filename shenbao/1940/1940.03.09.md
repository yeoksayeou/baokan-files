There is currently fierce fighting within Zhongshan, behind Macao. According to the Chinese side, the Japanese attack on Zhongshan has no military significance; if any, it is to divert the attention of the Chinese, causing the Chinese army in northern Guangdong to neglect defense. It is reported that the Japanese army concentrating in the Guangzhou area consists of three divisions, and will likely launch another large-scale attack on northern Guangdong. At the same time, the Japanese side has also concentrated a large army in the Yuezhou area, clearly preparing for another attempt to attack Changsha.

Editorial

### The Fuel Problem

The panic of life in Shanghai, although maintained by various efforts, is still flourishing. The threat of the fuel problem to general life is no less serious than the food problem. People cannot live without water and fire. General families in Shanghai used to rely on firewood and charcoal. Since the promotion of coal balls, firewood and charcoal have been replaced, which is also a natural trend. Given the scarcity of houses and the density of population in Shanghai, any daily necessities that occupy less storage space and have the same effect will naturally be welcomed. In addition, quite a few people use kerosene, smoky coal, and anthracite to cook. In normal times, fuel is not considered expensive because supply and demand are balanced, but recently it is not the same as before. Smoky coal is 210-220 yuan per ton, anthracite is 170-180 yuan, firewood is 1.5 yuan per bundle, charcoal is more than 10 yuan per load, kerosene is 14-15 yuan per can, and coal balls are 120 yuan per ton, which is still considered a bargain, but the deficit is worrying, and I am deeply afraid that it will be difficult to continue; but the price of each item is five or six times higher than before the war.

Why is the increase so high? This is certainly related to the relationship between supply and demand and cost, but special forces also contribute to it. Since the outbreak of the war, transportation between Shanghai and other places has changed; and the import of products from the mainland into Shanghai has been subject to disguised control, endless extortion, and very harsh demands, resulting in extremely heavy costs. When they are transported to Shanghai, they are often detained. For example, firewood has been detained since the end of last year and has not been released. I don't know what the intention is. Now, coal is imported from Wusong. If it has not been transported to the dock for loading and unloading, it cannot be considered that the goods have arrived safely, because they are often intercepted midway and forced to be resold. In an unstable environment, how can the price of goods be expected to be stable? In addition, with the outbreak of the European war, freight rates have soared. It costs 32 shillings to transport one ton of Indian coal to Shanghai, and 27 shillings to transport one ton of Annam coal. If calculated in legal tender, the freight cost per ton is as high as 80-90 yuan. Is it not like going south by chariot and heading north to expect the price to fall? Indian coal originally occupied a very small position in the coal market, but now it has become the main source of supply, and it is impossible to light a fire without it. Anthracite used to be supplied in large quantities from Liujiang and Shanxi, but since they fell into enemy hands, the source has been suddenly blocked, and everything depends on Hongji anthracite. The amount of Kailuan coal, which used to be a large supplier of smoky coal, is less than expected, so its price is cheap, but it is not easy to buy on the market. In the past, the amount of coal transported from Japan to Shanghai for sale was also large and could compete with Kailuan coal. Recently, Japan is also suffering from a coal shortage. Although there is still a small amount of coal shipped to Shanghai, it is not enough to meet the needs of Japanese factories, and coal production in North China is being carried away by the Japanese, making it necessary for Shanghai to seek coal from the south. Shanghai coal merchants see an opportunity to hoard and speculate. Even if there is a mountain of inventory, they are unwilling to sell it on the market, so the goods on the market become more scarce, and the situation of the coal shortage becomes more precarious.

Therefore, in order to solve the fuel problem in Shanghai, the fundamental solution is to increase supply and level freight rates. This is only a small solution. If there is more supply and the cost is lower, the price will naturally be stable. However, the increase in supply has to rely on a large amount of supply from coal production in North China, but whether we can get what we want is difficult to predict. The responsibility for reducing freight rates lies with the shipping industry, but the shipping industry believes that it is not only affected by the war, and that the soaring freight rates are also due to the high price of coal and the difficulty in reducing freight rates, so if the price of coal can be lowered, the freight rate will naturally fall. The coal industry believes that the high freight rate makes it difficult to lower the cost of coal, but the freight rate will be reduced and the price of coal will be stable. Which came first, the chicken or the egg, is impossible to determine, but both are for private gain. However, if the price of coal is not fundamentally leveled first, and the current cheap sale of coal balls is used to solve the difficulty of the fuel problem, it is still a long way from the topic. Even with the cheap sale of four catties of coal balls per person for one corner, the maximum is only 1,000 loads, and if there is any benefit to be gained, it is only 25,000 people; 40,000 to 50,000 people return with empty baskets every day, and only this embellishment is enough to pacify the people.

If the fuel problem is not solved for a day, the impact will not only make it difficult to use fuel at home. On a small scale, the problem of coal use in the boiled water industry is indeed worrying. If it is forced to stop business or increase prices due to lack of fuel, it will cause deep and great inconvenience to residents and suffering to the poor. On a large scale, coal is the food of machines. If they stop moving due to lack of coal, it will inevitably lead to the problem of unemployment of workers. This indirect impact is more serious than any other problem. Some factories plan to use anthracite or diesel to replace coal, but the price difference is not much, and the firepower is not easy to exert unless the boiler is modified, so it is difficult to share the panic of smoky coal for a while. Therefore, in addition to increasing ships and reducing freight rates to ensure smooth sources and lower costs, there is no other way to solve the problem of coal. As for wanting to accumulate coal in order to balance supply and demand and avoid exhaustion and return to a stable level, the current high price of coal is too heavy to bear, and I am afraid that it cannot be borne by the coal industry alone. Only by each industry seeking its own way, raising funds to order goods, and storing them for its own use, although the procedures are more complicated and the consumption is larger, there is no need to seek the convenience of the coal industry, but it is also a helpless move.

Electricity is also an important fuel in cities (lighting power heat). Since coal is expensive, electricity bills have also repeatedly increased surcharges, and recently have increased to more than 114%, more than doubling the original price. The power company purchases coal from mine owners and has a long-term contract. Because it is for direct consumption, the price is relatively cheap, so its cost is not comparable to that of general factories using coal. The power company's coal purchase contract has not yet expired, but it has repeatedly increased surcharges to plan ahead. If the contract expires and is revised, the price of coal will also increase according to the market ratio, and I don't know how much the electricity surcharge will increase. Electricity is a public utility, so it is allowed to be monopolized, so its business policy is not comparable to that of general industrial and commercial enterprises whose sole purpose is to make profits. Although its increase in fees is also out of necessity, it should obtain the consent of the Public Utilities Committee of the Gongbu Bureau as usual, but since it increases the burden on users, it is appropriate to share it with users so that everyone is aware of the reasons for the increase and why it must be increased by so many percentages, and there is no objection. I will regard the power company as the same as ordinary merchants who only seek profit. Is this the original intention of public utilities? I would like to say a word for the power company because of the fuel problem.

### The US Actively Provides Economic Aid to China: A US$10 Million Loan is Established, the Chinese Government Guarantees Tin Exports to be Used to Purchase Necessary Construction Goods

Washington: Jones, chairman of the Construction Bank Corporation, announced last night that the Export-Import Bank had allocated US$20 million yesterday for new loans to China. The funds were allocated from the new US$100 million in capital of the Export-Import Bank. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the United States has lent China a total of US$45 million, the first time US$25 million and this time US$20 million. Chen Guangfu, head of the Chinese Purchasing and Financial Inspection Group, said, "China will purchase hardware, gasoline, trucks, road-building machinery, mining and smelting machinery, medicines, and other necessary raw materials for construction through the Universal Trading Corporation. China will also continue to transport China's tung oil, tin ore, and other raw materials to the United States through the Universal Trading Corporation to meet the needs of US industries. Hu Shi, the Chinese ambassador to the United States, said, "We are extremely satisfied with the US government's timely financial assistance to the Chinese government." (8th United Press telegram)

Washington: The Export-Import Bank has announced that its board of directors has approved a loan of $20 million to China to facilitate the financing of non-military exports from the United States. It is reported that the United States will use tin transported from Yunnan Province as part of the payment for this loan, $10 million for Denmark and $1 million for Iceland. According to the capital of the Export-Import Bank, the National Assembly has approved an increase of 100 million to lend to China, Finland and other countries, so the bank has allocated $200,000 to Finland on January and $15 million to Sweden, $10 million for Norway. (8th Reuters telegram)

Chongqing: The Chinese authorities here regard the new US loan of US$20 million to China as a "gesture of friendship." A senior official of the Ministry of Finance said, "The new US loan to China will enhance our confidence in foreign aid and final victory." (8th United Press telegram)

Chongqing According to a Chinese government spokesman today, "The US loan to China this time shows the good trust of foreign governments in China. The reasons for this trust of foreign governments are two: (1) China's outstanding performance in fulfilling international debt credit; (2) The Sino-Japanese War has turned into a stage favorable to China." It also said, "In recent weeks, the assistance of friendly countries to China, although in different ways, has increased a lot." According to foreign observers, although the amount of the US loan to China this time is small, it is still a major spiritual blow to the Japanese government, so the relationship between Japan and the United States will inevitably become more deteriorated in the future. (8th United Press telegram)

### The Japanese Side Feels Deeply Anxious, Believing That the US Move is Not Friendly

Tokyo: Suma, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, told reporters last night after Washington announced a loan of US$10 million to China, "This is an unfriendly action, and we are extremely unwilling to see it become a reality." Suma also said, "On the eve of the establishment of the Wang Jingwei "Central Government", Japan is particularly dissatisfied with the US move. The United States often has legal basis for lending to China, and Japan has no reason to oppose it, but this loan is obviously an effective aid to the National Government."

### The Saying That the Tianjin Silver Issue Has Been Negotiated Has Been Firmly Denied by the Foreign Ministry, and the British Ambassador Has Also Stated That It Is Not True

Chongqing: There are rumors that the Foreign Ministry of the National Government has negotiated with Sir Kerr, the British Ambassador, on the Chinese silver issue in the British Concession in Tianjin. Tonight, the Foreign Ministry and the British Ambassador have firmly denied this rumor. Sir Kerr told a Reuters reporter, "The rumor that I have negotiated with the Chinese Foreign Ministry on the Tianjin silver issue is not true." The Chinese Foreign Ministry also made the same denial. A spokesman told Reuters, "This rumor is completely untrue." Some people say that the rumor has spread prematurely, but according to the opinions of people here, this compromise may never be reached.

### Zhu Jiahua Re-discusses the European War Situation

Chongqing: Today's Central Daily News published the second part of an essay by Zhu Jiahua, the Minister of Organization of the Central Party Headquarters. The first part appeared in yesterday's paper. The article analyzes in detail the power of various European countries in the war and predicts possible developments, stating that the Soviet Union cannot provide Germany with much economic assistance due to political, economic, and practical reasons. Although Germany and the Soviet Union are currently using each other, it is clear that the Soviet Union does not want to see Germany dominate European trade. This is why the German-Soviet military alliance has never gone beyond the stage of propaganda. The quantity of Soviet exports is currently not likely to be excessive, and what the Soviet Union currently needs from Germany are mostly products and raw materials needed by Germany's own war industry. The trade agreement between the two countries will not be implemented, and cash trade will not be significant. The Soviet Union's transportation problems also severely limit the transport of Soviet products to Germany. Under the current transportation situation, the Soviet Union can at most allocate one-tenth of its transportation tools solely for the transportation of Soviet raw materials to Germany, which is far too little to meet Germany's needs. Hitler is well aware of Germany's weaknesses and is using submarines, magnetic mines, aircraft, and pocket battleships in the hope of intercepting supplies from Canada, Australia, and New Zealand to Britain. However, this guerrilla strategy is not very effective. Experience has shown that even land guerrilla strategies cannot determine the outcome of any war without the support of a regular army. Germany's most proud air force cannot win it victory. Moreover, Germany will eventually have to cede its air superiority to the Allied side. According to estimates, only one pilot can be produced for every thousand people. Assuming that each aircraft requires four pilots, no European country can have the personnel needed for 20,000 aircraft. Britain, France, and their colonies have a population of over 600,500,000, so there is no shortage of manpower. Therefore, Germany's air force may currently have an advantage, but it will eventually be surpassed by the Allied countries. Germany will one day not dare to send its air force to Britain and France for fear of suffering heavy losses that cannot be replenished. Moreover, 60% of Germany's industrial areas are located within 150 kilometers of the front line, while most of Britain's industrial areas are more than 300 kilometers away. The degree of safety is naturally incomparable. The article concludes that the outcome of the war must be decided by the two armies on land. Both sides are currently trying to exhaust the other's strength and do not intend to use their land forces until they are exhausted or nearly exhausted. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)

### Britain Pursues Appeasement Policy Towards Japan; Chongqing English Newspaper Criticizes

Chongqing: The English-language Chu Pao published here today strongly criticized Britain's appeasement policy towards Japan. According to the newspaper, although Japan constantly infringes on Britain's interests in China, Britain has repeatedly delayed and taken no action. Observers say that Britain's policy in the Far East is a complete retreat. From this point of view, it is not far from the truth. Looking back on the past, we cannot but admit that the attitude of the Chamberlain government was fundamentally wrong. We firmly believe that the crux of the matter lies in Britain's belief in its appeasement policy towards Japan. We dare say that if Britain takes no action against Japan's aggression, Britain's reputation in the Far East will be completely lost. British expatriates in China should report their sufferings to their government and draw its attention. (United Press dispatch, 8th)

Although the Finnish government considered it inappropriate to accept, it was forced to decide to negotiate with the Soviet Union due to the difficulty in obtaining assistance from Britain and France. As far as the military situation is concerned, it is not yet hopeless, so the mission of the Finnish delegation is limited to negotiations. (Havas dispatch, 8th)

Stockholm: According to reliable sources in the capital, representatives from Finland, Sweden, Germany, and the Soviet Union are currently negotiating to mediate the Finnish war. However, this statement has not been officially confirmed. It is heard that Sven Hufvud, the former president of Finland, and Baschkiwiwi, who was engaged in negotiations with the Soviet Union before the war, have arrived in Stockholm. The German participant in the negotiations is apparently Ditwan Lich, the director of the intelligence office of the National Socialist Party, who secretly flew here for a day. Discussions on the possibility of establishing peace have undoubtedly been underway for many days. However, the Swedish authorities have consistently denied being "mediators" in the negotiations. The general opinion is that the Finns, in order to avoid further losses, may propose ceding the areas demanded by the Soviet Union before the war, with the possible exception of Hango Island. However, this proposal is apparently insufficient. Today, it is heard that the conditions required by the Soviet Union include the following points: (1) Petsamo, along with nickel mines and fishing rights; (2) Finland to destroy all coastal fortresses; (3) The entire Finnish coast of Viela and Lake Ladoga, including Sortavala. It is heard that the Soviet Union is prepared to cancel its demands for Hango. The Swedish side denies that Germany and Sweden have put any pressure on the Finnish government to accept these conditions. Telephone communications between Stockholm and several foreign capitals were interrupted last night and were reportedly restored at midnight. However, telephone calls from London were again rejected by Stockholm this morning. According to the Swedish authorities, the decision to temporarily suspend news telephone calls was due to the fact that non-British journalists had sent incorrect news yesterday. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)

Stockholm: The rumor about Sweden mediating the Soviet-Finnish conflict has now been further confirmed. Finnish cabinet minister Baschkiwiwi, along with former Finnish President Svinhufvud, has arrived here to conduct peace negotiations with Soviet Ambassador to Sweden Golentai. (Haitong dispatch, 8th)

Stockholm: This morning, representatives of Finland and the Soviet Union are directly negotiating here, but in order to strictly maintain the secrecy of the talks, they are meeting in a building on the shore of Lake Mälaren outside Stockholm. Former Finnish Foreign Minister Erkko told representatives of the press that he hoped the public would remain calm and peaceful and wait for the truth to come to light, and not lightly believe rumors and make wild guesses. Finland is currently still at war and has not announced a ceasefire. This is the only fact. (Haitong dispatch, 8th)

Helsinki: According to well-informed sources, former Finnish Finance Minister Tanner, who was negotiating in Stockholm, returned to Helsinki on the 1st of this month, accompanied by a representative of the Swedish government. The Finnish cabinet held a meeting on the 2nd of this month, and Tanner reported on the negotiations, stating briefly that the Swedish government was willing to be a mediator between the Soviet Union and Finland, and the Soviet Union had accepted Sweden's mediation proposal. The representative of the Swedish government immediately reported the Soviet Union's peace proposals to the Finnish cabinet. When the Finnish cabinet debated the issue, some cabinet members favored peace, while others still hoped that the Allied powers would step up their assistance. However, most cabinet members were very skeptical about the assistance of the Allied powers. The Finnish cabinet then decided to accept Sweden's mediation proposal, and the Finnish representatives set off for Stockholm on the 6th of this month. (Haitong dispatch, 8th)

Helsinki: Non-official circles in Finland have expressed surprise at the peace terms proposed by the Soviet Union to Finland via Sweden and believe that Sweden's willingness to act as a mediator for the alleged terms is astonishing. Finland learned of these terms from the New York News telegram published in Stockholm. The Finnish government has issued a statement stating that these terms are said to be broader in scope than those proposed last fall, but the content is still unknown. There has been much discussion in diplomatic circles about these terms. It is said that, on the one hand, the Finnish government is paying close attention to Sweden's mediation, and on the other hand, it must be aware that Finnish public opinion will not allow negotiations to be conducted on the basis of these terms, as it believes that the Soviet Union has not achieved much victory after months of war and should not make concessions that are detrimental to national independence. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)

Berlin: Today, when a spokesman for the German Foreign Ministry met with foreign journalists, he was asked whether the negotiations between the representatives of the Soviet Union and Finland in Stockholm were promoted by Germany. He replied that Germany's attitude towards the Soviet-Finnish conflict remains the same as before and has not changed since the outbreak of the Soviet-Finnish war. I personally do not know about this matter, so I cannot answer about the peace negotiations in Stockholm. Someone said, "Then can you deny the rumors that Germany is involved in this matter?" The spokesman replied, "I cannot deny it either, because I know nothing about this matter." (Haitong dispatch, 8th)

The Hague: The rumor that Sweden is mediating the war between Finland and the Soviet Union has been confirmed by news from Stockholm. Although political figures in that country have refused to disclose any information in order to avoid hindering the negotiations, they have also admitted that the conditions proposed by the Soviet government are even broader in scope than those proposed before the Soviet-Finnish war. In addition, the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Swedish Parliament has been holding daily meetings in recent days, but it is still unknown whether Finnish representatives have attended. (Havas dispatch, 8th)

Stockholm: The status of the negotiations to mediate the Soviet-Finnish war is currently unknown, as the Foreign Ministry has not had any special activities in the past 24 hours. It is generally speculated that the meeting place is probably the residence of Swedish financiers or industrialists. (Haitong dispatch, 8th)

Stockholm: Finnish Prime Minister Tiete and Cabinet Minister Basiviki (who represented Finland in negotiations with the Soviet Union before the outbreak of the Finnish-Soviet War) are currently here. According to rumors from some quarters, the two may go to Moscow today to hold talks with the Soviet authorities. As for the rumors that Finnish Army Commander-in-Chief Mannerheim and General are also in Stockholm, there is no basis for them. Swedish Foreign Minister Gönder recently told an interviewer from "Daily Overview" that various rumors about the Finnish situation are not factual and are intended to be misleading. The media should not lightly believe them. (Havas dispatch, 8th)

The Hague: Local newspapers have recently published news from Copenhagen, the capital of Denmark, stating that Finnish Ambassador to Sweden Erkko and Soviet Ambassador to Sweden Madame Golontei have begun peace negotiations through the mediation of Swedish Foreign Minister Hesede. Although the Swedish authorities have not confirmed this statement, they have not denied it. According to several observers, peace negotiations have indeed begun. A well-known Finnish politician, the current Minister without Portfolio, Baschkiwiwi, who represented the country in negotiations with the Soviet Union before the outbreak of the Finnish-Soviet War, arrived in Stockholm a few days ago, along with the Director of Public Relations of the Finnish Foreign Ministry. In addition, Dietrich, the Director of the Intelligence Department of the German Foreign Ministry, secretly traveled to Stockholm for a day and then returned to Germany. The German Ambassador to Finland also had a long conversation with General Rosenbo, the representative of General Mannerheim, the Commander-in-Chief of Finland, to inform him of Germany's views on the issue of Finnish-Soviet peace. (Havas dispatch, 7th)

Paris: Well-informed sources in Paris have recently stated that there is no question of the Soviet Union issuing an ultimatum to Finland expiring tonight, but there are actions by Germany and Sweden to establish peace in the Soviet-Finnish war. These negotiations have been underway for several days, and there is no time limit. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)

Copenhagen: It is heard that General Mannerheim, Commander-in-Chief of the Finnish Army, has flown to Stockholm. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)

Soviet Troops Advance in Northern Finland

Moscow: According to a communiqué from the headquarters of the Leningrad Military District, Soviet troops made significant progress in the north yesterday, occupying the town of Nazi, 153 kilometers south of Petsamo. At the same time, four islands west of the town of Piccalanda in northern Lake Ladoga were also occupied by Soviet troops (the four islands being Maxinnan Sari Island, Pecho Sari Island, Pechomin O Sari Island, and Xiangka Sari Island). The Soviet Air Force bombed the enemy troops and shot down 15 enemy aircraft in aerial combat. (TASS dispatch, 8th)

Fierce Fighting Around Vyborg

Helsinki: Soviet troops attempted to advance across the ice in the Finnish Bay, resulting in fierce fighting. It is heard that there are piles of corpses in the forests around Vyborg. According to various sources, the intensity of the Soviet military offensive and bloody battles is unprecedented. However, it is heard that the Soviet army has been temporarily contained by the Finnish army's machine gun fire and the Finnish air force's intense bombing. When the Soviet army attacked, it gathered a large number of tanks and armored vehicles to advance across the ice, resulting in foolproof bombing targets for the Finnish artillery and aircraft. In this terrible battle, the number of Soviet soldiers who could still advance was very small. According to Finnish military reconnaissance reports, the Soviet side is currently massively reallocating its troops. The Finnish side said that this is due to the Soviet side's underestimation of the resistance it will encounter in Vyborg. The Finnish side's latest battle report stated that the Soviet army's fierce attack on the northwestern coast of Vyborg Bay in the western part of the Karelian Isthmus is currently fighting at the mouth of Vyborg Bay, and the Soviet troops advancing across the ice to seize the islands in the area have been heavily shelled by the Finnish side, destroying more than 30 tanks. The Finnish army between Vyborg Bay and Vostuga repelled a local Soviet attack, destroying 17 tanks. In the Deibel area, the Soviet side launched an attack after shelling, but was repelled. On the north side of Lake Ladoga, the Soviet army attacked in Piccalanda and the islands, and has occupied several islands defended by the Finnish army. The Finnish Air Force bombed Soviet troops on the ice of the Gulf of Finland and Vyborg Bay. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)

Helsinki: A plan by Soviet troops to break through the Finnish military defense line in Vyborg Bay has completely failed. As a result of the Finnish military counterattack, several coastal strongholds have been recaptured. No less than 30 Red Army tanks were destroyed in one day yesterday, and their communication lines with the rear food stations have been severely threatened. In addition, although the Red Army repeatedly attacked on the northeast side of Lake Ladoga, it failed to succeed. (Havas dispatch, 8th)

British Volunteers Arrive in Finland

London: The Finnish Embassy in London announced that a batch of British volunteers has arrived in Finland, and the remainder will be sent to Finland as soon as possible. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)

Finnish Reserves Called Up Early

Copenhagen: According to yesterday's news from Helsinki, the Finnish 1920-year-old reserves have now been called up. It is said that, under normal circumstances, the reserves of this grade must be enlisted in the summer of next year. (Haitong dispatch, 8th)

France Provides Finland with Military Equipment

Reports from Lebanon stated that, since the outbreak of the war between Finland and the Soviet Union, the military supplies provided by France to Finland include 175 aircraft, 496 artillery pieces, 79,500 shells, 5,000 machine guns, 40 mines, 200,000 hand grenades, and 20 million rounds of ammunition. (Havas dispatch, 8th)

Finnish Ambassador to Britain Speaks

London: The Finnish Ambassador to London told a Reuters reporter today that Finland is always prepared to make peace with the Soviet Union, but not unconditionally. Finland's independence must be preserved. He also said that he had visited British Foreign Secretary Halifax yesterday, but was unwilling to disclose the content of their conversation. The ambassador also mentioned the terms proposed by the Soviet Union in the news, saying that if the rumors are true, the Soviet Union seems to have increased its demands, especially regarding the two places of the Karelian Isthmus and the north side of Lake Ladoga. Another Finnish spokesperson said that 100 volunteers arrive in Finland every day at the moment, and the nephew of former US President Roosevelt will also go to Finland soon, and it is said that he can lead 3,000 people with him. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)

The Finnish Situation Has Reached a Decisive Stage

The Hague: London is extremely excited about the news of the mediation of the Soviet-Finnish war. The general impression is that the Finnish issue has reached a decisive stage. Although British officials remain silent and avoid making comments, political figures are clearly worried that the credibility of the Allied powers will suffer serious losses after the success of the mediation. London claims that Britain and France may make a decision in the next few days, and if they do not interfere in the Finnish issue, the efforts to encourage Finland to resist will be reduced. Britain is very angry because it believes that Sweden is putting pressure on Finland to accept the Soviet demands, but the general opinion is that Norway will oppose the Soviet Union's territorial demands and tend to support the Allied powers' plan to aid Finland. (Haitong dispatch, 8th)

China Hopes for a Ceasefire Between the Soviet Union and Finland

Chongqing: No definite news has been received regarding the rumored peace talks between the Soviet Union and Finland, and Chinese officials are strictly silent on the dispute between the Soviet Union and Finland. However, the general Chinese public here welcomes the possible news of peace between the two countries. The Finnish war has put China in the most complex position, causing China to abstain from voting at the League of Nations meeting. Therefore, in this Sino-Japanese war, although the Soviet Union has provided valuable assistance to China, China itself has been invaded by Japan, so it cannot openly support the Soviet invasion of Finland. It is generally believed that a satisfactory end to the Soviet-Finnish peace talks will automatically solve the complex problem that Chinese leaders have been constantly paying attention to, that is, what policy China should take if the Soviet Union is drawn into the European war. Once the Soviet Union and Finland make peace, the danger of the Soviet Union being drawn into a war against Britain and France will be reduced, and the Soviet Union will be able to pay more attention to the Far East. If the Finnish war drags on, the Soviet Union will obviously have to deploy most of its military force to the European front, and the result may be a compromise policy with Japan in the Far East. It is expected that peace between the Soviet Union and Finland will greatly reduce the Soviet Union's anxieties in Europe, and the Soviet Union will be in a position to focus on the Far East and be able to step up its assistance to China. This will not be possible if the Finnish war continues. Furthermore, Soviet-Finnish peace will generally accelerate the peaceful situation in Europe and severely hit Japan. The Western countries cannot pay attention to the Far East due to their own disputes. Once peace is in sight in Europe, Japan's position is particularly dangerous. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)

Tragic Car Accident in Finland

Helsinki: A fast train bound for Sweden collided with a special train near Tampere yesterday, killing 20 passengers, including 16 evacuated children, and injuring 20 passengers. The accident occurred in the dark and in heavy wind and snow, so the driver could not see the danger signals. Many children were burned to death in the carriages. The scene of women searching for their children in the deep snow was pitiful. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)

### Welles Visits Paris Authorities, Inquires About French Viewpoint on the War, Peace Impossible Without Concrete Guarantees from Germany, Poland, Austria, and Czechoslovakia Must Restore Independence and Territorial Integrity

Paris - U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles visited French President Lebrun and Premier Daladier yesterday. It is understood that their discussions included France's perspective on the war, relations between France and Italy, and the situation on the Scandinavian Peninsula. Mr. Welles arrived fifteen minutes earlier than scheduled and visited the French President before the reception preparations were completed. The conversation lasted over an hour, unlike the usual brief courtesy calls. After leaving the Presidential Palace, he drove to the Ministry of War and spoke with Daladier for another one hour and forty minutes. Afterward, Daladier told a Reuters reporter that he was very satisfied with Mr. Welles' visit and conversation. Last night, Mr. Welles attended a banquet at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs with few guests. Mr. Welles then continued his conversation with Daladier, which was probably the most important conversation during Mr. Welles' visit to Paris. Judging from the guest list, the nature of the banquet was more official than social, as the attendees included Vice President Schutemps, Minister of Justice Pomaret, Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs Le Bas, and Mr. Goulond from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. According to responsible sources, France explained the following war aims to Mr. Welles: (1) Restore the independence and territorial integrity of Poland, Austria, and Czechoslovakia; (2) Any peace must have significant and concrete guarantees from Germany to prevent future German aggression; (3) France does not want a superficial peace that would leave Europe vulnerable to German threats in the future. France has no desire to dominate Europe, and Germany must show that it has abandoned such intentions. (Reuters, 8th)

Paris - U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles visited French Senate President Jeanneney and House Speaker Herriot this morning. He then held talks with Socialist leader and former Premier Blum. (Havas, 8th)

London - When U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles comes here next week, in addition to meeting with Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax, he will also discuss the current situation with opposition leader Attlee and deputy leader Greenwood. It is expected that Mr. Welles will also meet with Liberal Party leader Sinclair. (Reuters, 8th)

London - According to a special dispatch from here, the "Brazilian Daily" commented on the peace mission of U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles, stating that negotiations are impossible between the Allied countries and the Munich betrayers and their repeatedly treacherous government. The "Al-Ahram" newspaper in Cairo also commented, stating that peace is currently impossible. The Treaty of Versailles lasted twenty-five years; if today's peace cannot last three months, Europe and the entire world must first eliminate the vicious and harmful elements. These elements are rarely seen throughout the world. If they are allowed to spread, they will endanger all of humanity and cause humanity to regress for centuries. Therefore, the free, independent, and glorious United States or other countries do not want to recognize the sword as the ruler of the world or violence as the judge of humanity. (Reuters, 8th)

### British House of Commons Passes Air Force Budget, Air Minister Wood Attends and Explains, Aircraft Production Increased to One Hundred Percent

London - When Air Minister Wood concluded the debate on the Air Force budget in the House of Commons last night, he made unrestricted guarantees that the British bomber fleet was ready for large-scale operations. After Mr. Wood's speech, the entire House passed the budget amidst cheers. (Reuters, 8th)

London - When Air Minister Wood presented the Air Force budget in the House of Commons, he declared that, for the sake of security, the total budget amount would not be disclosed. He could only say that this year's Air Force budget was unprecedented in nature. The greatest efforts and expenditures on air defense were unprecedented in any era, but this budget only represents a part of the continued actions that we intend to take in conjunction with the Empire and the Allied countries. Our expenditures and efforts cannot be limited to this year; they must continue and increase until we achieve our established goal, which is the establishment of air superiority. Mr. Wood continued by saying that the British Air Force bomber fleet stationed in France had carried out over a thousand raids deep into German territory day and night. The majority of the British Air Force soldiers stationed in France had been active over the Siegfried Line, with the number of takeoffs for patrols, pursuits, and engagements with enemy aircraft totaling no less than two thousand. Our Air Force soldiers have fully demonstrated their value, shooting down more than forty enemy aircraft around our country's coasts without any losses on our side. We also understand that many other enemy aircraft were forced to land in neutral countries or at sea. Mr. Wood further explained the progress of the British Air Force, saying that when he presented last year's budget, the total number of personnel in the British Air Force was one hundred thousand. Today, each Air Force command controls nearly this number of personnel. Since the start of the war, the Coastal Command's fleet has traveled over five million miles. They have discovered submarines more than one hundred times and attacked them more than sixty times. In addition, there have been more than seven hundred convoys protected by aircraft, which has been quite effective. Mr. Wood also mentioned cooperation with France, saying that its nature is extremely close, with extensive plans for exchanging information, jointly researching aircraft production, and mutually sharing secret equipment, with joint enjoyment of various new developments. As for overseas training aviation organizations, if fully utilized, the flight schools in Canada, Australia, and New Zealand can train 20,000 pilots and 30,000 crew members each year. In addition, the South African government has made extremely helpful proposals for training British Air Force pilots. Flight schools will also be established in Rhodesia and Kenya. Regarding production, new factories are being established every month. The output of factories manufacturing aircraft continues to increase. A plan has been drawn up to ensure that future production will be more than adequate. The production plans of the various autonomous territories have also begun to take effect. The first batch of Canadian-made aircraft is now flying. In addition, large orders have been placed with the United States and Canada. Mr. Wood continued by mentioning civil aviation, saying that we have now jointly decided with Australia and New Zealand to link New Zealand with the Imperial air route, with weekly flights across the Tasman Sea starting in April. A powerful Civil Aviation Advisory Committee has been established to safeguard the status of civil aviation after the war. Mr. Wood also stated that he could assert that in the past twelve months, the strength of the British Air Force has increased by at least one hundred percent, and he firmly believes that even in terms of quantity, the aircraft production of Britain and France today exceeds that of Germany. Mr. Wood concluded by saying that we can be sure that the powerful and efficient air defense organization that has been established will inflict significant losses on the enemy. Our bomber fleet is prepared and able to inflict heavy blows on the enemy and will continue to do so frequently and without interruption. (Reuters, 7th)

### Two Air Battles Off the British Coast in One Day, One German Bomber Shot Down

London - British and German aircraft engaged in two air battles off the British coast today. In the first incident, a German Heinkel bomber flying at an altitude of 8,000 meters was shot down into the sea by a British Spitfire fighter. In the second incident, two German Heinkel bombers engaged a group of British aircraft off the eastern coast of Britain and fled in panic after a brief exchange. (Havas, 7th)

The Hague - A German aircraft again attacked the Dutch steamer "Hansweert" in the North Sea today, dropping six or seven bombs, all of which landed near the ship. It then strafed the ship with machine guns, injuring one crew member. (Havas, 7th)

The Hague - According to a report from London last night, German aircraft again attacked ships off the southeastern coast of England. At 8:00 PM last night, six explosions and machine gun fire were heard on the southeastern coast of England. Coastal residents saw German aircraft in the sky. It is not yet known whether any British ships were sunk. (Haitong, 8th)

Berlin - Regarding the Reuters report that the British Air Force intruded into German territory on the nights of the 6th and 7th of this month, flying a distance of 1,600 kilometers, the official here has clarified that after investigation by the German responsible authorities, it has been confirmed that one British aircraft did fly in the far eastern border of Germany and fled towards Flensburg. Another "RAF" aircraft intruded into German northwestern airspace. All other aircraft were repelled by German aircraft near Heligoland. From this, the world can see that Britain must fly a long distance of 1,600 kilometers to achieve this kind of "military success." (Haitong, 8th)

President Aguirre led the Minister of Health and the Secretary-General of the Presidential Palace to inspect the disaster area last night. (Havas, 8th)

### Living Panic in Beiping

Beiping - The general attention of the city has shifted from political events to the economic situation. Even the central political conference to be held in Nanjing, which may decide the future political status of North China, has failed to attract attention and make people ignore the rapidly deteriorating food situation. Although the authorities are doing their best to remedy the situation, the current state of food for the people has all the signs of brewing a major tragedy. It is a miracle that the Chinese can still survive under these circumstances. According to recent figures, even the most frugal living expenses are twice as much as income. Therefore, there have been events similar to riots in Beiping recently. Food is either running out or being sold at exorbitant prices, or it is in the hands of hoarding profiteers. Countless old people, children, and women with pale faces often gather in front of grain stores, waiting to buy food, which is a truly tragic sight. (Reuters, 8th)

### Ministry of Health徵Gathering Medical Talents

Chongqing - The Ministry of Health and the Army Medical Service Department recently formed a joint conference to collect medical talents from all over the country, because the current number of doctors and nurses in the army is insufficient.

Another batch, mostly self-employed doctors, is also being collected, but they are considered to be in the reserve. (United Press, 8th)

Last night, insurance companies sent people to guard the fire site to prevent bandits from looting the unburned items. It is heard that most of the burned shops have fire insurance with foreign insurance companies, and the losses of various insurance companies are about 500,000 yuan. (Reuters, 8th)

### Shantou Japanese Army Implements Political and Economic Offensive, Chinese Army Recently Closing in on Shantou City

Shantou Correspondence: The war in eastern Guangdong has become increasingly tense recently. The Chinese army's Hong Zhi Zheng's unit attacked Nanao on the night of February 25, recovering the small islands of Haishan and Hongmen near Huanggang. More than 50 Japanese soldiers on the islands were all killed. Chenghai City was also stormed by the Chinese army's Li Shao Ru's team on the evening of the 26th, and all Japanese puppet institutions in the city were destroyed. On the 27th, they attacked Xiaopu Ouding, only 18 Chinese miles from Shantou City. From the 27th, shops in Shantou City were closed, and all traffic outside the city was cut off. Chaoan City has been surrounded by the Chinese army for many days, and news is unclear. On the 25th, Japanese warships covered speedboats carrying troops to harass Pengzhou Suotuo. Of the twelve speedboats that left, only eight returned to Shantou. The citizens were very excited to see this situation.

The Puppet Municipal Government Suddenly Appears

Shantou City only has a puppet local maintenance association, with Zhou Zhizhen as the puppet chairman. There are no other administrative organs. All the power in Shantou City is held by Japanese Consul Suetsugu Takai and Special Agent Saburo Omoto. It is difficult to justify itself from the perspective of international law when dealing with the United Kingdom and the United States as the master. On February 21, Prince Fushimi visited Shantou and appointed Zhou Zhizhen as the puppet mayor of Shantou. Zhou was flattered and posted a red paper notice on the 23rd, calling himself the mayor without explaining who appointed him from a higher authority. Under the puppet mayor, there are four bureaus: Public Security, Public Works, Finance, and Education. The candidates for the puppet bureau chiefs have not been determined, but Shantou is close to Taiwan, and the Governor of Taiwan and the Japanese Navy are not sympathetic to Zhou and are secretly排擠ing him.

All the Economy is Controlled

Because the Japanese army's military offensive failed, they changed to two strategies: political offensive and economic offensive. However, Zhou Zhizhen has no connection with Chaozhou and Shantou. Although he holds a puppet position, he has absolutely no effect on the political strategy. Therefore, the liaison officer of the Japanese Asia Development Board led a group of traitors and merchants to carry out an economic offensive. First, a number of smugglers were sent to Dapu and other places to establish a unified tax bureau. All ships must pay donations and receive flag protection before they can enter and leave the sea, otherwise they will be robbed. Fishing boats are limited to returning to shore on the same day. Every two担 of fresh fish caught are taxed one担. The entire Shantou fish market (Yongtai Street Wei Santai City) was occupied by the Japanese army and a "Shantou Fish Market Association" was established. Fish shops cannot sell fish, and fishing boats cannot privately own their fish. Ships loaded with fresh fish from all over the world must stop at the end of Yongtai Street. The Japanese side stipulates that 100 catties of fresh fish will only be given back 20 yuan. After buying it, the price is set at 5角 per catty. The association was established on March 1, and is operated by the Japan Fisheries Company and the Fukudai Company, with a capital of 50,000 Japanese military yen. The Chinese capital is 5,250 yuan from Hequan Wanji, and 500 yuan each from Yuanshunli, Haiquan, Sanshunquan, Lianqi, Deshun, Yongyuan, and Donghai. Guangwanyuan, Haifeng, Sanheli, Guangshun, and Yutai each occupy 250 yuan. The chairman is Japanese, and there is one Japanese and one Chinese director. The lower-level members are partners of the fish shop. From then on, vegetables, fresh fish, and pork are all controlled by the Japanese.

### Fierce Fighting in Zhangzhu, Yixing, Japanese Army Collects Copper and Iron in the Occupied Areas of Suzhou and Wuxi

Changzhou Correspondence: Yixing is located in an important area. The Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway crosses the county. The county is surrounded by mountains, making it strategically important. Although the county seat has been occupied by the Japanese army, Zhangzhu and other towns have been controlled by the Chinese army for the past two years, and they attack at any time. Therefore, the county seat has been repeatedly won and lost. A few days ago, a war broke out with the Chinese army in Liyang, and they once rushed to the Tianwang Temple in Lishui. The Chinese army in Zhangzhu also fought with the Japanese army in Yixing. The artillery fire was fierce. The Japanese army used aircraft to bomb indiscriminately. The Chinese army defended by relying on the terrain. The fighting is still fierce. In the occupied areas of Suzhou, Wuxi, Wucheng, and other places, the Japanese army has been trying to collect waste copper and scrap iron. The ignorant people are only interested in profit. They sell whatever they get at a good price. For the past two years, they have been almost exhausted. Now the price of raw copper is 80 yuan per 担, and purple copper is 110 yuan, which is ten times higher than the market price before the war, but there is no spot货了.

### Ningxian County Government Limits the Export of Strong Young Men, Temporarily Suspends Issuance of Export Permits

Ningbo Correspondence: The Ningxian County Government, because many strong young men of eligible age have recently applied for export in the name of handling goods, which will have a significant impact on conscription if this continues.

However, merchants coming to Ningbo from Shanghai who carry certificates from the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce or the Hometown Association will be allowed to process them in a variable manner to restrict them.

### Suzhou's Electricity is Controlled by the Japanese, The Reason is the Lack of Fuel

Suzhou Correspondence: The Suzhou Electric Plant in this county was founded by commercial capital. After the outbreak of the war, it was once suspended. Then it was forced to be taken over by the Japanese Huazhong Company and continued to operate. Recently, due to the lack of fuel, the Japanese have implemented control over electricity, and from March 1, they will first stop sending electricity to Japanese users. Users will not be allowed to turn on electric lights after 10 pm. As for the factory's electricity consumption, it is limited to no more than 4,400字 per month. There is also news that street lights will be stopped after 12 o'clock in the middle of the night.

### As Spring Approaches, Flooding in Northern Jiangsu is Concerning

Huaiyin Correspondence: The dikes along the Grand Canal in Gaoyou, northern Jiangsu, have been damaged because the Chinese and Japanese armies have used them as a basis for digging and building fortifications. Flooding is feared when the peach blossom water rises in an instant. Originally, the design and estimation could be carried out during the winter when the water is dry, and construction could be carried out during the spring farm leisure to protect the lives and properties of millions of people in northern Jiangsu in summer and autumn. However, since the Japanese army invaded, the Chinese army has attacked from time to time, and there is no money for construction. Even if there is a design, it can only be suspended. Before the breach of the Yellow River in Zhongmu is blocked, it is planned to dredge the Zhangfu diversion river and block the Sanhe Dam as a preventive measure so that the Yellow River can flow into the sea. However, if the Zhangfu diversion river is dredged, the Zhongshan River must be opened at the same time, otherwise, even if the Sanhe Dam is blocked, the Hong Lake will inevitably overflow and harm Anhui Province. How can we bear to use neighboring provinces as ditches? If the Zhangfu and Zhongshan rivers are dredged at the same time, it is impossible to do so without huge sums of money. In the current situation, there is no such time. However, for the current emergency measures, if the east and west dikes of the canal are not repaired, the Gaoyou Canal dike will be in danger during this spring flood season.

### Shandong Japanese Army Abuses American僑, American僑Detained and Money Robbed

The Qingdao correspondence of the English "American Evening News" on March 2 stated that since the first day of this year, several unfortunate incidents involving American 僑 have occurred in Shandong, which are briefly described as follows: (1) The Japanese authorities in Yixian County arrested a Chinese servant employed for many years by an American missionary in the area and executed him immediately. (2) According to visitors from Jinan, it is widely rumored that about half of the hundreds of teachers and students of the Taian American Church school who were arrested and taken to Jinan last month have been executed. The school has been closed, and it goes without saying that the teachers and students who were not arrested have fled Taian. (3) The Chinese chief of staff of the Qingdao American Consulate was arrested a few weeks ago and released after negotiation the next day. (4) American 僑Bailarock was carrying legal currency when he went out from HSBC Bank recently. He was arrested by a Japanese and a Chinese man in plain clothes. His hands were tied and he was taken to the Japanese naval patrol headquarters. Mr. Bai and his companions argued reasonably, claiming that they were American 僑. Only then was the rope untied, and then they continued to the naval headquarters. The American consul heard the news and negotiated. As a result, Mr. Bai was detained for a while, and then he retrieved the legal currency and was released. (5) American missionary Ms. Aikomp returned to India after vacationing in the United States and visited friends in North China on the way. A few days ago, when she landed in Qingdao, the Japanese officials took away her US$500 travel checks and the cash she carried with her. After the American consul negotiated, they were recovered.

### Overview of Compulsory Education Implementation in Jiangxi Province: One Compulsory School to be Established in Every 'Bao' (Unit) Except for Guerrilla Areas

(Ji'an Correspondence)程柏庐, the Director of Education of Jiangxi Province, has been exceptionally diligent in promoting compulsory education. The number of schools established is the highest among all provinces. The Ministry of Education commended him before the war. The province's performance in compulsory education during wartime has been particularly noteworthy. Currently, apart from the overall statistics for the implementation of compulsory education in the 28th year of the Republic (1939), which are still difficult to obtain, the Sixth Administrative District alone has added over 1,000 schools. It is evident that achieving universal education throughout the province is not a difficult goal. The following is a summary of the actual implementation of compulsory education over the past four years:

Original Plan

There are 1.5 million school-age children in the province. Excluding those already in school, 1.25 million are out of school. The province has 25,000 'bao'. Starting from the 24th year of the Republic (1935), 4,000 elementary schools will be added each year, totaling 20,000 schools in five years, accommodating 1 million students. The existing 5,900 public and private elementary schools will add an average of 1,000 short-term elementary classes each year within five years, accommodating 250,000 students. Compulsory education in the province can gradually become universal.

Implementation Status

In the 24th year of the Republic (1935), the number of elementary schools in the province increased from the original 5,000-plus schools to 14,448 schools, with 19,716 classes and 633,995 students. In the 25th year of the Republic (1936), the number increased to 17,374 schools, with 20,596 classes and 699,692 students. In the 26th year of the Republic (1937), due to the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, the number only increased to 17,938 schools, with 22,719 classes and 749,150 students. In the 27th year of the Republic (1938), the number increased to 18,453 schools, with 22,870 classes and 779,382 students. In the 28th year of the Republic (1939), according to the original plan, universal establishment should be implemented across the board. Currently, except for guerrilla areas, most 'bao' have been able to complete the establishment of one school per 'bao', and the prospect of universal education is not far off.

Financial Subsidies

The compulsory education subsidy fees for various counties over the past four years are as follows: In the 24th year of the Republic (1935), the central government provided 100,000 yuan, the provincial treasury 130,000 yuan, and local sources raised 2,715,39 yuan, totaling 2,945,1259 yuan. In the 25th year of the Republic (1936), the central government provided 210,000 yuan, the provincial treasury 250,000 yuan, and local sources 2,974,435 yuan, totaling 3,434,435 yuan. In the 26th year of the Republic (1937), the central government provided 290,000 yuan, the provincial treasury 450,000 yuan, and local sources 4,245,380 yuan, totaling 4,985,380 yuan. In the 27th year of the Republic (1938), the central government provided 200,000 yuan plus 3,000 yuan, the provincial treasury 315,000 yuan, and local sources 4,606,919 yuan, totaling 5,124,919 yuan.

Improving Private Schools

In the 24th year of the Republic (1935), there were 2,521 private schools, of which 1,274 were improved after supervision, with 19,624 students. In the 25th year of the Republic (1936), there were 2,099 private schools, of which 977 were improved, with 16,333 students. In the 26th year of the Republic (1937), there were 1,888 private schools, of which 857 were improved, with 13,659 students. In the 27th year of the Republic (1938), there were 1,814 private schools, of which 971 were improved, with 13,951 students.

Regarding teacher training in the province, in addition to registering or certifying qualified elementary school teachers, training classes are also being opened to cultivate more talent. It is estimated that in three years, unqualified teachers can be gradually eliminated and replaced by qualified ones. Furthermore, each county is ordered to organize primary education research associations to seek further study methods to increase educational efficiency. In addition, the implementation of mobile teaching methods and the promotion of compulsory education in guerrilla areas have all yielded achievements in various counties.

### Authorities of the Two Concessions to Cooperate in Suppressing and Stabilizing Prices; The French Concession to Host the Event in Three Groups; Market Situation Has Shown Improvement in Recent Days

After the French Concession Public Works Bureau organized the Price Stabilization Committee on the 19th of the month, in order to smoothly assist in the progress, it held a meeting on the afternoon of the 7th to study the unresolved issues discussed by the subcommittee and conduct further research. The 工商學院局 (School of Commerce and Industry Bureau) also sent representatives to attend and participate. French Consul 欧仁 (Ō仁) and the Public Works Bureau representatives expressed their welcome and hoped that all parties would provide assistance to stabilize prices within the shortest possible time and ensure that it would be achieved. The following are letters to various parties:

Public Works Bureau Sends Representatives to Attend

The 字林部 (Chinese-English newspaper "North China Daily News") reported that the Public Works Bureau recently appointed Hong Ke and Mei Luo ·San (梅洛·三) to investigate the price issue. They attended the subcommittee meeting of the French Concession to investigate the market situation yesterday morning (the 7th). This is an auspicious sign that the authorities of the French Concession and the Common Concession will cooperate to address the high prices of goods within a limited time. Pei Si Tuo (裴司脱) and other three representatives of the Public Works Bureau attended the meeting, accompanied by officials from the bureau.

Close Cooperation to Alleviate People's Difficulties

欧仁, the French Consul General and Chairman of the Price Stabilization Committee of the French Concession, delivered a brief welcoming speech, briefly describing the work that the committee has been doing and stating the necessity of close cooperation between the two concessions to alleviate the people's difficulties. It is heard that the representatives of the Public Works Bureau attended the meeting to facilitate the preparation of a detailed report to be submitted to the Public Works Bureau. The details of yesterday's meeting were not disclosed, but it is roughly to discuss the current prices of goods.

Three Subcommittees Established, Each Responsible for Specific Tasks

According to 欧仁, the French Consul, who told reporters yesterday afternoon, the Price Stabilization Committee of the French Concession has conducted various inquiries on the market situation, and all the discussion materials required have been provided by the police department. In order to effectively solve the price problem, three subcommittees have now been established, namely: (1) The committee for investigating rice and grain, consisting of 社員·奇实· and Lu Juyi; (2) The committee for investigating coal, consisting of 杜克·金芝轩 and Yao Zhongban; (3) The committee for investigating the general retail market, consisting of 艾格尔·史洛波契柯夫 and Wan Molin.

Currently Collecting All Information

These three subcommittees are assisted by employees of the Public Works Bureau and the French police. After their recommendations are accepted by the全体委员会 (full committee) and approved by the French Consul General, they are currently collecting all the information necessary to set the highest price limit. 欧仁 then pointed out the difficulty of the problems to be solved by the committee. It is said that the cooperation of all the authorities is welcome to facilitate the task of stabilizing the market as much as possible so that the citizens can benefit from it.

Market Prices Slightly Lower Due to the Dissemination of Information

At the same time, the committee is carefully monitoring market actions. Since the committee began its work, the situation has improved. In the past few days, rice prices have eased slightly, falling by about 1.5 yuan per load. The committee is now making every effort to set the highest price limit in the shortest possible time, but if it is to be effective, the implementation of this extremely challenging plan will take some time.

The Right to Inspect Accounting Books and Documents

According to the order issued by the French consulate against those who speculate and hoard necessities, the established committee has the right to inspect the accounting books and other evidentiary documents of merchants in order to set the highest price limit to alleviate the difficulties encountered by citizens due to the exorbitant prices. On the one hand, it allows the owners to obtain reasonable profits. Violators will be fined up to 1,000 yuan. In some cases, the committee may also confiscate the goods.

### To Prevent Speculation and Hoarding: Increase the Interest Rate on Remittances; Noon Market Interbank Loan Interest Rate Also Restored; But the National Currency Interest Rate Remains Unchanged; Chinese and Foreign Banks Simultaneously Charge Custody Fees

Before the war, financial institutions were scattered all over the country. After the war, they concentrated in the cities, especially in Shanghai. The credit position of each bank, which used to be distributed throughout the country, is now concentrated in Shanghai. Compared with the period between 1932 and 1933, the concentration of silver in Shanghai is even greater now. In the past, the credit position had various enterprises across the country as investment targets. Now, it is concentrated in one place, with only Shanghai as the center of investment. There is no place for legitimate investment, so it tends to speculation.

Speculative Trend Intense

Now, 銀錢 (silver and money shops), in view of the recent surge in speculation and hoarding, are raising interest rates to restrict it. Since March 2, the Bank Joint Reserve Committee has announced that the interbank loan interest rate for national currency is 0.28 fen per thousand yuan per day, the remittance rate is 0.23 fen per thousand yuan per day, the discount rate for 90-day acceptance drafts is 0.28 fen per thousand yuan per day, the remittance rate is 0.23 fen per thousand yuan per day, and the interest rate for interbank remittances is 0.2 fen per thousand yuan. The overdue interest on interbank remittance loans made by various peers to the association has been changed to 0.25 fen per thousand yuan per day.

Increase Interest Rates

According to the above interest rates, compared with February 1, the national currency interest rate has not changed, and the remittance rates have increased by 0.05 fen. The association has set the interest rate for interbank remittance deposits in February at 3.5 yuan per thousand yuan (i.e., a monthly interest rate of 3.5%). The interest rate for loans from money shops has been increased from 10.05 yuan per thousand yuan per day to 12 yuan. Due to the large number of interbank bill transactions in the market, the noon market interbank loan interest rate has been restored since March 1.

Charging Fees

The Shanghai Banking Industry Association and the Shanghai Foreign Exchange Banking Association have also decided on measures to restrict speculation and charge custody and withdrawal fees. The measures are recorded as follows: It has been decided by the joint meeting of the two associations that all member banks should charge custody and withdrawal fees for various property documents held in custody or with a lien on behalf of customers in accordance with the following regulations: (1) Stocks and bonds: For each withdrawal of the above-mentioned valuable securities, the handling fee is 0.125% of the market price for securities with a value of less than 10,000 yuan. For those exceeding 100,000 yuan, the handling fee is increased by 0.0625% for the excess amount, regardless of the amount. The minimum handling fee is one yuan. (2) For entrusting the custody of land contracts and leases (excluding those used as loan mortgages), as well as boxes, packages, wills, insurance policies, and other documents, whether valued or sealed, a custody fee of 5 yuan per year or less than one year will be charged (paid in advance).

Conditions for Exemption

(Note): A. Customers who come to apply for inspection or temporary withdrawal of various securities in accordance with the following conditions will not be charged an additional handling fee: (1) Those who apply for inspection or temporary withdrawal no more than once every three months (cannot be accumulated); (2) Those who do not change the contents recorded on the custody receipt; (3) Those who return the original item to the bank within 24 hours of temporary withdrawal. Customers who violate the above conditions may be deemed by the bank to have withdrawn the stored item. B. The handling fees stipulated in this regulation do not apply to the following property documents: (1) Valuable securities used as collateral for interbank loans; (2) Deposit documents issued by the bank itself; (3) Items held in custody on behalf of the government; (4) Items held in custody on behalf of charitable organizations or religious groups; (5) Items held in custody by the bank in the capacity of trustee or executor.

### Yesterday Was International Women's Day: The Women's Community Celebrated Vigorously; Enduring Hardships and Shouldering the Responsibilities of the Times; Correcting Extravagant and Wasteful Lifestyles

Yesterday was the International Women's Day. The women's community in this city, due to the current national crisis, did not hold extravagant celebration ceremonies, but only held gatherings and meals separately to commemorate the occasion. Women from all walks of life are generally aware of the responsibilities that women should bear in this great era. They are determined to liberate themselves with the spirit of enduring hardships and strive for the survival of the nation and the race. In view of the abnormal prices and the suffering of disaster victims, they will unanimously promote the frugality and disaster relief movement. They will make every effort to correct the extravagant and wasteful lifestyles of some women in order to strengthen and establish the status of women in society.

### Japanese Information Department Sends Personnel to Conduct Activities in This City

It is reported that the Japanese Cabinet Information Department has specially sent four members, namely Kataoka Seiichi, Ishii Ryoichi, Nishisaka Fumio, and Imai, who arrived in Shanghai on the Shanghai Maru on the 8th and will leave Shanghai for Ningbo on the 11th, and then go to Qingdao, Tianjin, Beiping, and Mongolia. It is heard that their task is to collect a variety of information for reference by the Japanese Cabinet Information Department.

### Singapore Authorities Improve Treatment of Chinese Merchants; The Order Prohibiting the Import of Goods from Non-Sterling Bloc Has Been Revised; But Only Applicable to Chinese Merchants

According to news from the National Products Community in this city, after the Singapore authorities issued the Financial Defense Ordinance prohibiting the import of goods from non-sterling areas, Singapore and other regions felt greatly hindered. Therefore, merchants in the area submitted petitions to the local government, urging improvements. After the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce re-submitted a request to the Singapore government to improve this prohibition, the local Financial Supervisor has agreed to revise the measures.

Chinese Traders Can Continue to Trade

After this ordinance is implemented in the future, the tens of millions of dollars of business between Singapore and various regions can continue to trade. When these newly revised measures are implemented in the future, they will still be subject to the local foreign exchange control. It is heard that the authorities have agreed to start registering the shops and shipping companies in the area. At the same time, in order to reduce the obstacles to trade in various regions here caused by the Financial Ordinance promulgated in 1939 and to maintain the principle of foreign exchange control, the local Foreign Exchange Control Department has formulated flexible measures. According to another report, merchants from various countries trading in Singapore include Chinese, Malays, and Arabs. However, these newly revised measures only apply to Chinese merchants.

Overseas Chinese Engaging in Business Must Register

In these measures, the transaction is limited to 5,000 yuan, but it is limited to Singapore and the Dutch East Indies, the Philippines, Vietnam, and various ports in China. There are currently 156 Singapore Chinese merchants registered with the authorities. In the future, the number will reach more than 500. The new measures are divided into two parts: For Chinese merchants engaged in commerce, all commercial requests must be notified to the secretary of the local Chinese Chamber of Commerce and then forwarded to the Financial Supervisor. For shipping companies from other places coming to and from Singapore, all registered Chinese merchants must have their export trade registered in the department for presentation to the authorities. If there is any violation of the law, the authorities can cancel their registered name.

### Changes in Import Restrictions

A certain national goods organization in this city received a letter yesterday from Mr. Li Xiaoyan, manager of the Singapore Chinese National Goods Company, reporting on recent changes in Singapore regarding the import of foreign goods (referring to goods from non-gold standard countries). The report was quite detailed, and excerpts are as follows: The original letter stated, "Since the Singapore government issued its second set of control regulations on the import of national goods, dividing them into restrictions and prohibitions, applying for import permits has become quite difficult. The application for prohibited goods was announced to be suspended at the end of last year. On the 19th of this month, it was further announced that thirty types of restricted goods will be

Temporarily Suspended from Import.

The application stated, "(1) Orders for the following restricted import goods (listing their numbers and descriptions as listed in the gazette notification) (referred to as AP forms, i.e., restricted goods application forms), such requests will never be accepted. (2) The reason for this measure is due to the large number of CP forms (i.e., prohibited goods application forms) placed on November 18, 1939, or requests for approval after that date for AP forms that have already been submitted and approved. The appropriate date for prior applications for textiles imported from Hong Kong is December 28, 1939. (3) It is known that some applications have been cancelled later, or the actual orders according to the AP form permit are not approved for various reasons. Please promptly report them to the Import Control Department, along with copies of the related AL or CL forms, for reference, which will be of great assistance to importers in the future. (4) If there are indeed difficulties for special importers, then there is a request for

Exemption from Restrictions.

Such suggestions will be considered, and the criteria for decisions will often depend on the applicant of the CL and AP forms stating the average import figures of special goods within four months in 1938. Also, whether the number of items imported by the applicant since December 1, 1939, does not exceed the average import number during the corresponding period in 1938. These suggestions will be discussed on or after March 1, 1940, and must be accompanied by the so-called numerical evidence. (5) It is pointed out that there are a large number of orders that have been requested or ordered for almost all the remaining goods on the restricted import goods list (referring to the forty-six types of goods other than the thirty types). It is intended to take the same approach of stopping the application of AP forms for these goods as well." However, according to the explanation of the Restriction Import Control Officer, the goods in the restricted import list can continue to be imported into Malaya in the future, but only after the current high volume of orders is absorbed and reduced proportionally to the amount normally required by Malaya will they be allowed again. Therefore, manufacturers in Shanghai should still strive for the excellence of their products in order to achieve sales and not be discouraged," (The following is omitted, and the current temporary suspension of import applications applies to)

List of Goods

Details are listed on the left: (1) Other manufactured grains, (2) Other meats, (3) Canned sardines, (4) Dried fruits and preserved fruits, (5) Onions, (6) Brandy, (7) Spirits (foreign-made), (8) Distilled liquor (including medicinal liquor) with a standard alcohol content not exceeding 26%, (9) Depressed porcelain ware (such as cooking and household utensils), (10) Tinplate, (11) Copper and copperware, (12) Flashlights and batteries, (13) Gray unbleached cotton cloth bolts, (14) Bleached cloth bolts, (15) Dyed cloth bolts, (16) Printed cloth bolts (including woven sarongs), (17) Cloth bolts with woven colored fabric, (18) Cotton sarongs, (19) Rayon cloth bolts, (20) Rayon sarongs, (21) Leather shoes and boots, (22) Cloth and rayon overcoats, (23) Rayon underwear, (24) Cloth underwear, (25) Other types of printing paper, (26) Other paper materials and paper products, (27) Bicycle accessories, (28) Rockets and other fireworks products, (29) Incense sticks and joss paper, (30) Other types of cosmetics.

### General Manager Candidate: Archibald Rose Receives Popular Support; Over One Hundred American Citizens Sign Recommendations

According to the English-language "China Press", the recommendation of American lawyer Archibald Rose as a candidate for General Manager of the Shanghai Municipal Council by American citizens in this city has been enthusiastic. Therefore, Rose's name will be submitted to the American Association this afternoon (the 8th). Only the signatures of ten American taxpayers are required for recommendation, but over one hundred people signed the proposal last night (the 7th). It is expected that this number will double today. It is understood that there are only two seats for American candidates. Now that there are three candidates, MacDonald, Cornell, and Rose, unless one of them withdraws, the American Association will hold a preliminary election next week to select two of them. However, judging from the current situation, it seems that none of the three, including MacDonald, intend to withdraw.

### Ethical Society Urges: Abstain from Smoking, Alcohol, Gambling, and Prostitution; Indulgence Invariably Drains Wealth and Harms the Body; We Must Strive to Serve Society and the Nation

The Shanghai Ethical Society has issued a proclamation to the citizens urging them to abstain from smoking, alcohol, gambling, and prostitution, to invigorate their spirits, and to serve society and the nation. The proclamation states, "Citizens of all walks of life, in this day of exorbitant prices and high cost of living, it is difficult to cope with extraordinary expenses, not to mention the poor citizens, even the middle and upper classes often feel financially strained. Therefore, to overcome this difficult situation, the only way is to practice thrift, reduce material enjoyment, and save on unnecessary consumption. 'Smoking, alcohol, gambling, and prostitution' are the most harmful among consumer goods. They are described separately below:

Smoking

contains nicotine, a toxic substance. Prolonged smoking can damage the brain's nervous system and affect physical health. This refers to cigarettes. As for opium, morphine, heroin, etc., their toxicity is even more severe. Occasional smoking can invigorate the spirit, but once addicted, it is not easy to quit. Indulging in it will render one useless in everything, eventually leading to emaciation, spiritual exhaustion, and resembling a ghost, despised by others.

Alcohol

is not as harmful as smoking, but prolonged drinking can also lead to nervous weakness. Instances of causing trouble due to alcohol are numerous, and instances of making mistakes due to alcohol are also often heard. Moreover, the price of alcohol is affected by commodity prices and continues to increase. The raw materials for expensive alcohol are mostly foreign goods, and the annual leakage amounts to tens of millions of dollars. In terms of wartime economy, it is still a significant loss to the country.

The harm of prostitution

is known to all. Looking at those who frequently visit brothels, it is not uncommon for them to lose their lives due to excessive loss of energy, and the waste of money is a minor matter. At this time of resisting aggression and building the nation, we should all strive to serve the country. How can we indulge in sensual pleasures?

Opening the newspaper every day,

one often sees countless suicide news stories. The reason for suicide mostly stems from gambling debts and economic pressure. Gambling is a matter that wastes time and money on a small scale and leads to bankruptcy on a large scale. Although it is sometimes done as a game, people often fall into this path and are like falling into a trap, indulging in it day and night, hoping for luck. As a result, they have no intention to work, and those who have jobs abandon them. After abandoning their jobs, they willingly engage in despicable acts, which is truly heartbreaking. From this, it can be seen that smoking, alcohol, gambling, and prostitution are indeed the great enemies of us today. It is hoped that those who are addicted to these habits will initially reduce their quantity and frequency, and then completely abstain from them. This will not only lead to the happiness of individual future prospects but also the dawn of the nation's future.

### Japanese Patrolmen Beat a Chinese Man to Death at the Intersection of Jinling Road in Zhabei

Yesterday at around 1 PM, three Japanese navy patrolmen were at the intersection of Datong Road and Jinling Road in Zhabei. They encountered two Chinese men dressed in short clothes, resembling coolies. For unknown reasons, this angered the Japanese soldiers, who struck them with rifle butts and wooden sticks, kicked them with leather shoes, and threw the two men onto the road, hitting them for about half an hour. The two Chinese men died immediately. The Japanese soldiers were still not satisfied and struck them with wooden sticks several more times before leaving. There were many onlookers along the road at the time, but no one could do anything.

### Salvaging the Sunken Jingsheng Steamer: The Work Is Difficult; The Ship Is Heavy, The Water Is Deep, and Mud Has Seeped In

Since last year, the Ningbo Fellow-Provincials Association in Shanghai has been making every effort to provide relief to the victims in the Ningbo area. Last year's fundraising for the Ningbo disaster was particularly active. Now, in response to the tragic capsizing of the Jingsheng steamer and the plight of those awaiting relief, it has issued another appeal for donations to provide relief to the distressed passengers and handle all the aftermath.

Starting the Salvage

After the Jingsheng steamer capsized, the sunken ship drifted to the bottom of the river at the entrance of the Sanjiangkou North Peace Association in Zhenhai due to the impact of rapid tides. Ten divers hired from Shanghai have already arrived in Ningbo by barge and have begun to measure and salvage the sunken ship. However, the water depth in that area reaches over twenty fathoms, and due to the intrusion of mud at the bottom of the river, the ship's compartments have three levels, and the ship's body is heavy, so there is no hope of lifting it out of the water for the time being.

Handling the Aftermath

Since the Ningbo-based Aftermath Committee began its work, it has been extremely busy. The committee has now moved all the recovered bodies to the Siming Guildhall on Xinwei Road to await identification. It has also set aside the time from 2 PM to 4 PM daily to handle matters related to claiming lost items. Donations from all walks of life in Shanghai and Ningbo to provide relief are also quite enthusiastic. Yesterday, it continued to receive donations of 10,000 yuan from Hefeng Cotton Mill and others to handle the aftermath.

### The Shanghai Municipal Council Library Receives Famous Italian Works: The History of the Italian Army Since the Roman Empire

Mr. Nielone, the Italian Consul General in Shanghai, recently presented the complete yearbook compiled by the Army Department of the Italian government to the Shanghai Municipal Council Library on behalf of Colonel Polin Scheibina, the military attaché of the Italian Embassy in China. This book details the history of the Italian army from the Roman Empire era to the present day. The Shanghai Municipal Council has sent a letter to Mr. Nielone expressing its gratitude.

### The Shanghai Municipal Council's Budget for This Year: Health Department, Section A: Temporary Expenditures

The draft temporary expenses for the Health Department totaled 122,800 yuan. After item-by-item review by the Health Committee, 184,600 yuan was deducted. The necessary uses included construction fees for the unfinished portions of the abattoir, fees for adding tap water faucets to the Hongkou vegetable market, and fees for paving gutters and sidewalks in the Jing'an Temple and Hongqiao cemeteries, etc., totaling 28,200 yuan.

The following items were resolved not to be spent this year: (1) Land for a proposed vegetable market in the West District, about 2 mu, 80,000 yuan; (2) Addition of cemetery land in the Hongqiao Cemetery, 85,000 yuan; (3) Addition of fences and walkways in the Hongqiao Cemetery, 7,400 yuan; (4) Construction of dormitories and coffin sheds in the Luo Bie Gen Crematorium, 3,000 yuan.

The largest increase among the various recurring expenses was the expenses of the Chinese Isolation Hospital, with an increase of 413,800 yuan. Subsequently, the director of the Health Department decided to temporarily suspend the Xinza Road branch of the Chinese Isolation Hospital.

The reason for the increase in recurring expenses this year is nothing more than the increase in temporary living allowances for staff and the rise in the prices of various daily necessities and utilities. In addition, there is no additional revenue projected for this year. As for the surplus from rice sales, the bureau will make every effort to ensure that the subsidy is used in the most effective way for public health.

The above budgets have been reviewed and approved by the Health Committee, and the draft budget for recurring expenditures originally listed 2,782,250 yuan, which is 893,600 yuan more than the previous year. The breakdown is as follows for comparison. After multiple efforts to reduce other expenditures, the total amount of the recurring expenses budget was changed to 2,423,260 yuan. The breakdown is as follows for comparison. Allocations and other reasons are also contributing factors. As for the subsidy, this subsidy is usually listed under the "Health Team" section of the budget, as customary. The amount to be allocated this year cannot be determined at present. The following items are of a trial nature and were passed at a meeting on February 16. Except for necessary adjustments by the heads of the Finance and Health Departments, they will be submitted to the Finance Committee for review.

### Intimidation Case at a Bean Curd Shop: Complicated Inside Story; Chairman of the Bean Curd Industry Association and Others Arrested; Also Involves the Clerk of Lawyer Landon; Police Lawyer Investigates and Files Charges

The Qia Xing Qi bean curd shop at 414 Avenue Edward VII recently experienced intimidation and other issues. Two suspects were arrested and sentenced to four months of imprisonment by the Special Court. Afterward, the Xinzha Police Station suddenly received a letter from British lawyer Landon, stating that Hua Detective No. 232 of the police station, Yang Fusheng, was sheltering the above-mentioned criminals and requesting that he be transferred.

The letter was affixed with the names and chops of five bean curd shops. Hua Detective Ding Huaguo and Western Detective Li Te started the investigation. They first investigated the five named bean curd shops. According to the shops, the seals were indeed those of the shops, but the secretary of the Bean Curd Industry Association, Bao Qirui, instructed them to stamp the seals, and there was not a single word on the paper. Therefore, they did not foresee the accusations against Detective Yang beforehand. It is suspected that they were added later. After Detective Ding conducted a

Detailed Investigation,

it was determined that the letter was colluded and forged by the chairman of the Bean Curd Industry Association, Xu Taoqing (a Shanghainese residing at 13 Guangxi Road, operating three bean curd shops), and the secretary, Bao Qirui. Consequently, Xu and Bao were arrested and sent to the Second Criminal Court of the Special First Court yesterday morning. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin prosecuted them for

forging documents

under Article 217 of the Criminal Law and for false accusations under Article 169. Xu and others confessed that a clerk named Lu of Landon Law Firm instructed them to stamp blank letterhead. At the time, he said that the court's sentence for the criminals in the Qia Xing Qi case was too lenient and that they were preparing to appeal. They had not seen the text in advance. After Judge Xiao Peishen reviewed the confession, he ordered that the hearing be rescheduled for one week later.

### Large-Scale Tuberculosis Prevention Campaign to Begin in Mid-Month

Since Shanghai became an isolated island, the surge in population and the poor living conditions have led to an increasingly rampant invasion and spread of tuberculosis. The lower classes are particularly hard hit. Leaders from all walks of life in this city, concerned about the citizens, have joined forces to launch a large-scale tuberculosis prevention campaign. Mr. Yu Qiaqing has been appointed as the honorary president of the conference, and it is reported that Mrs. Lan Ting, Xu Jiqing, and Yan Fubao will serve as honorary vice presidents, and Mr. Lin Kanghou will serve as president, with Yuan Ludeng and Ding Fubao as vice presidents.

At that time, a general screening will be conducted for potential tuberculosis cases throughout the city, so that all residents can have the opportunity for early diagnosis and early treatment, in order to reduce the spread of tuberculosis. This large-scale tuberculosis prevention campaign is a first in this city. Not only is the organization sound, but the planning is also thorough. It will certainly improve the health of citizens and enhance international attention. All sectors will surely unanimously provide assistance.

### It Is Reported That Shanghai-Ningbo Ships Have Decided to Increase Freight Rates Again; It Has Been Submitted to the Authorities for Review; Ordered to Compile Statistics

Foreign ships operating on the Shanghai-Ningbo line, due to the continuous increase in coal prices and rising costs, had previously increased freight rates to compensate for losses. According to a recent inquiry from a "New Voice" reporter to the shipping industry, various shipping companies have recently determined that, due to the skyrocketing price of coal, which is many times higher than in the past, and the fact that Shanghai-Ningbo ships have to wait outside Zhenhai for transshipment, resulting in significant delays, with the longest delays exceeding one month, not only increasing consumption but also reducing revenue due to delays, they have decided to increase freight rates again. The various shipping companies jointly discussed this matter last month and formulated the following measures: (1) General cargo will be increased by 100% of the original freight rate. (2) Small cargo will be increased by 50%. These measures have been submitted to the Ningbo authorities for review. However, it is understood that the authorities believe that these measures are not yet appropriate and that a comprehensive plan should be developed from all sides to achieve a balance between the interests of shipowners and cargo owners. The shipping companies have been notified to compile detailed statistics on the recent voyages of their ships, such as the longest and shortest number of days, and the amount of revenue and expenditure on fares and freight rates, and submit them for review. Then, the Ningbo Shipping Management Office will convene relevant agencies to discuss and decide with the various shipping companies. The companies are now rushing to compile statistics so that a solution can be decided soon.

### Coal Briquette Certificate Holders Should Respect the Time Limit for Delivery; Those Who Exceed the Time Limit Should Be Punished; Those Who Exceed the Price Limit Will Be Warned

The Shanghai Coal Briquette Industry Association held a joint meeting of factories at its Tianjin Road headquarters yesterday afternoon, attended by representatives from over ten factories, including Yi Taixing, Nanyang, and Guohua. Chairman Chen Cuifang discussed: (1) The Coal Briquette Certificate was previously announced by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce in conjunction with this association, with a deadline of February 15 for delivery. According to reports from various member factories, many certificate holders have come to the factory to take delivery within the deadline, but there are also many who are taking a wait-and-see approach. How should this be handled? Please decide. It was resolved: (A) From now until the 11th, a notice will be published in the newspaper again, advising certificate holders to come to the factory to register and complete the delivery procedures. (B) After the deadline, in accordance with the methods agreed upon by the public organizations and chambers of commerce, the factories will copy and submit the names of the certificate holders to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for disposition. (2) The original agreement for exchanging coal briquettes for coal scraps at an 80% discount is now inconsistent among the factories. How should this be rectified? It was resolved: From now on, the exchange will be made at an 80% discount from the time the truck arrives at the factory. The meeting adjourned at around 6 PM. In addition, the Xiangtai Coal Company on Laobeimen Street in the French Concession sold coal briquettes at a price exceeding the limit. After the purchaser attached an invoice and reported it to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Chamber of Commerce immediately sent a letter to the Coal Industry Association for warning. It is now reported that the Coal Industry Association has already sent a letter of warning, stating that the publicly set price limit must be observed in the future and must not be exceeded.

### Stolen Jewelry Case: Still No Clues

According to the North-China Daily News, between 6 PM and 9 PM on the 2nd of this month, when Madame Dunbaie, a guest at the El Dorado Apartments on Avenue Albert, was out watching a movie, jewelry worth 158,000 yuan was stolen from her apartment. Detectives from the French Concession Police were summoned, and the investigation began that night. Six days have passed, but the detectives handling the case still have no clues to investigate. The thieves entered the apartment without breaking any doors or windows, and there were no fingerprints found. Apart from the small safe in Madame Dunbaie's trunk containing the jewels being stolen, nothing else was lost in the apartment. The thieves acted quietly when committing the theft and did not arouse any suspicion from other residents of the apartment. It is believed that there were several thieves, and they must have known Madame Dunbaie's movements in detail; otherwise, they would probably not have entered the apartment at that time. On the 6th of this month, two suits of clothes were found in a nearby trash can and have been handed over to the police, but it is not yet known whether the two suits of clothes are related to the theft.

At that time, Hua Detective Zhang Peilan of the Chengdu Road Police Station happened to be passing by and witnessed the scene. He helped to chase after them. However, the robber Jin intended to resist arrest by using a gun. Detective Zhang also drew his gun and fired a shot, hitting Jin in the chest, injuring him and capturing him. A pistol and four bullets were seized. The coat he was wearing was the original stolen item belonging to Zhu Jincheng. He also called Hua Police No. 2728, who arrested Wang A'gen and seized the original stolen gold watch. Only "Little Three" escaped. The injured robber was sent to the hospital for treatment. Wang A'gen was sent to the Special Court yesterday morning along with the stolen goods. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin requested a postponement, and Judge Xiao ordered Wang to be detained and the hearing postponed for seven days. The stolen goods were returned first.

### Finance: Forward Foreign Exchange - Trend Somewhat Looser

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no change in the official rates of the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC). The unofficial market for British and American currencies remained stable. A slight loosening trend was observed amidst the quiet, but the outcome was the same as the closing rate of the day before yesterday. The morning began with the overseas exchange rates for American and British currencies continuing to report gains of 2.375, leading to a weakening of British and American currencies at the opening, with prices at 4.125 and 6.75 respectively. Subsequently, the market became calm, with little activity. It was not until after 9:30 AM that speculators slightly closed out their long positions in American currency for this month. At the same time, foreign banks also showed willingness to sell. As a result, the American currency briefly strengthened, with the loosest rate being an interbank transaction at 6.78125. Then, as foreign firms slightly remitted funds, the situation stabilized. By the noon close, the rates remained at 4.125 and 6.75. However, the April American currency rate slightly hardened. The afternoon situation remained quite stagnant. Although the British-American Tobacco Company and the Bank of Japan attempted to acquire currencies, foreign banks were willing to supply them, so there was no impact. By the evening close, the British and American currency rates were the same as the morning opening rates, resulting in a gain of 0.02125 for British currency and a loss for American currency compared to the previous day. The potential trend of futures was not much different from the spot rate, with only the April American currency rate appearing slightly firmer than the spot rate.

Some Long Positions Settled This Month

The morning began with London rates rising by 0.0625 for both near-term and long-term contracts. The New York silver price remained stable. London spot gold exchange rates for British currency against American currency and French currency remained unchanged, while against Shanghai, it contracted by 0.0625. The American currency rose by 2.375 against British currency, remained unchanged against Shanghai, and rose by 1.375 against French currency. The central bank's official rates for various currencies remained the same. The morning opening selling price for spot currency by banks was 4.25 for British gold and 6.75 for American currency, a flat rate for British currency and a loss of 0.03125 for American currency compared to the previous closing rate, due to the increase in exchange rates. At the same time, the opening rates for futures also showed a flat rate for British currency and a gain of 0.02125 for American currency. After the opening, the market was quiet, with little activity. When HSBC announced that the official rates would not change and the silver balance tax was announced to increase by 0.25, speculators slightly sold off their positions. At the same time, foreign banks also showed willingness to sell futures, so the market trend was slightly firmer amidst stability. It is estimated that speculators sold American currency for this month to HSBC at 6.75. At the same time, a certain bank acquired spot American currency from a foreign bank at 6.78125. At that time, American currency for this month at 6.7875 and American currency for the next month at 6.625 could be purchased. Then, foreign firms suddenly settled their positions by selling British gold for May at 4.015625 to Macgarry and other foreign banks and acquiring spot American currency from Huabi, Youli, a certain bank, and others at 6.75, which made the situation more stable. However, foreign banks trading futures remained willing to sell, so there was a further slight strengthening. At the noon close, British gold was at 4.125 and American currency was at 6.75, with no change compared to the morning opening rates. The only change in futures was that the April American currency rate was slightly higher by 0.03125 compared to the morning opening rate.

The Afternoon Market Was Quite Quiet

The afternoon market was initially quite quiet. Later, although the British-American Tobacco Company slightly remitted funds and the Bank of Japan also attempted to acquire currencies, HSBC was willing to maintain British gold at 4.125, and other foreign banks were also willing to supply at the same price, so there was no change. By the close, British gold was at 4.125, American currency was at 6.75, British gold for this month was at 4.109375, American currency for this month was at 6.71875, British gold for the next day was at 4.0625, and American currency was at 6.625.

### Tianjin Banks Repeatedly Sold Off, Gold Market Returned to Slump

Yesterday's spot gold market re-entered a slump. Although Hong Kong banks bought a total of 4-5,000 taels in the middle of the day, the Tianjin banks repeatedly sold off, and individual long position holders also sold off at limited prices because they were burdened by high interest rates and saw no profit. As a result, the market fell again. The morning opening was 15 yuan lower, at 4,780 yuan. Later, a certain gold shop made purchases on behalf of Hong Kong banks, and securities firms also bought in, so the market once rebounded to 4,790 yuan. A certain money exchange firm then fiercely sold off on behalf of Tianjin banks, and a certain bank also sought to sell. At the same time, the foreign exchange market slightly hardened, so the price was pushed down to 4,760 yuan. Later, as the foreign exchange rate stabilized and the selling pressure eased, Hong Kong banks took the opportunity to buy again, so by the noon close, the market had returned to 4,774 yuan. Afternoon trading was quiet, and the situation was slightly stable. The result was a gain of 2 yuan, with the closing price at 4,776 yuan, which was 10 yuan lower than the previous day. Total trading volume was about 1,700-1,800 taels. Jewelry gold remained stable, and customs gold remained flat.

Spot Gold Fell 19 Yuan

From the morning, the initial market situation for spot gold (per 10 taels) was weak. A certain money exchange firm and gold shop competed to push down the price, so the opening price was reduced by 15 yuan. The gold shop conducted interbank transactions for 50 taels at 4,780 yuan. Shortly after, Hong Kong banks, seeing the price was low, commissioned a certain gold shop to buy in. At the same time, securities firms also bought in on behalf of clients. In an instant, the price rose by 10 yuan. The securities firm bought in 30 taels from the money exchange firm at 4,770 yuan. Later, because Hong Kong banks stopped buying and a certain bank suddenly started selling forcefully, and the money exchange firm continued to sell off on behalf of Tianjin banks, the market fell sharply by 30 yuan. The bank sold 20 taels to the money exchange firm, retreating to 4,760 yuan. Subsequently, Hong Kong banks took the opportunity to buy again at a low price. At that time, foreign exchange rates stabilized, and gold shops and securities firms also followed suit and bought in, so the market rebounded by 16 yuan. A certain jewelry shop bought in 30 taels from a fellow shop at 4,776 yuan. Near the closing time, a certain bank sold off 40 taels to the securities firm at 4,774 yuan, setting the noon closing price. In the afternoon, the initial opening was slightly lower by 1 yuan. The gold shop sold 20 taels to the securities firm for 4,773 yuan. After this, a certain bank suddenly bought in, and the money exchange firm also made purchases, so the market gradually rose by 7 yuan. The securities firm sold 30 taels to a certain bank for 4,780 yuan. Afterwards, the money exchange firm came to sell off, retreating by 4 yuan. The jewelry shop sold 10 taels to the securities firm for 4,776 yuan, setting the evening closing price. As a result, the market fell by 19 yuan compared to the previous day, with a daily fluctuation of 30 yuan. The cash price for gold sold by the current gold shops was a few yuan higher than the spot gold price, while the buying price was reduced by 20 yuan. The current price for standard gold was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price, and there was little activity.

Jewelry Gold Remained Stable

The selling price of jewelry gold per tael remained stable. Datonghang remained at 485 yuan, and Xinhanghang was the same as the above price. The buying price was reduced by about 15 yuan.

### British and American Currencies Softened

Yesterday's foreign currencies saw a slight abundance of supply for British and American gold pounds, and the market was soft. The supply of British and American gold notes was relatively strong, and the market price was weak. In the morning, it once fell to 14.6 yuan. Later, demand increased, and the market price rose slightly. The evening rate was 14.63 yuan. Philippine notes followed the trend of softening, while Japanese gold notes remained stable. The evening rate was 1.295 yuan. Korean notes were weak, with an evening rate of 1.015 yuan.

The interbank lending rate of the Money Trade Association was quoted at 0.15 for both the morning and afternoon markets, with no change.

### Securities: Domestic Bonds and Foreign Shares - Trading Was Scarce - Kung Ho & Co. Announced Dividend

Yesterday's securities market remained in a sluggish state. Both long and short positions settled and exchanged types of transactions, with few new transactions. Although major players appeared, the market price did not decline as a result, as there were always those who took the opportunity to cover their short positions. The long positions hoped that loans would be established and the market would be firm, while the short positions feared that rumors from Nanjing would come true and did not cover. The mutual accusations led to greater stability. Yesterday morning, Xinfu was mostly sold, followed by No. 38. The rest were scattered individual investors. On the buying side, Tongkang acquired Class B, Dafeng and Gongmao acquired Class A, Jiufeng slightly recovered, and Hongkang, Taikang, and Lianyi all had demand. Market prices were slightly weaker. In the afternoon, Jiufeng and Dafeng switched from buying to selling, No. 38 switched from selling to buying, Tongkang continued to acquire Class B, Lianyi continued to buy, and Dingkang also had an appetite to buy. Market prices slightly turned firm and stable. The result was mixed highs and lows, but still only a difference of 0.05 to 0.1 yuan. The total transaction volume was about 400,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below:

Category | Highest | Lowest | Closing | Compared to Previous Day
---|---|---|---|---
Unified Class A | 57.05 | 56.95 | 57.05 | Down 0.05
Unified Class B | 50.35 | 50.15 | 50.30 | Flat

Stock trading: 40 shares of Zhoucha Bank were traded at a price of 20 yuan.

Yesterday's stock market at the Public Brokers' Association saw scarce trading, but the stabilizing trend that began on Thursday has not wavered. Although the public was interested in stocks such as Gangye, Jardine Matheson, Shanghai Banking Corporation, and Yangzi Banking Corporation, there was no increase in prices. The price of raw rubber has hardly changed recently, so the rubber stock market was also bleak.

According to news from Hong Kong, the Hong Kong government intends to levy taxes on corporate profits. This may also be a reason why the market has not been stable temporarily. However, in practice, this measure does not affect various foreign companies in this city that operate in accordance with the Chinese Company Law (although many of these companies are registered in Hong Kong) or impose this burden on merchants.

Kung Ho & Co., managed by Jardine Matheson, announced that it will hold the annual shareholders' meeting on March 17. The board of directors also decided to pay a final dividend of 24 yuan per share in national currency for 1939, in addition to the interim dividend of 10 yuan per share in national currency that was already paid on August 30 of last year, for a total of 34 yuan in national currency per share for the whole year.

### Cotton Yarn: Longs and Shorts Wait and See, Yarn Market Hovering

The yarn market is calm and does not deviate from the hovering situation. Both long and short positions are holding a wait-and-see attitude. However, in reality, although there are no large transactions in the South China region, sporadic purchases continue uninterrupted, so the market situation is stable. However, some have a higher base and are less interested in trading. However, raw materials remain firm and cannot be relaxed. The closing price for 20-count Shuangma yarn for March was 913 yuan.

The spot yarn market opened this morning with a tighter atmosphere. The price for 20-count Shuangma yarn for March was 914 yuan. As soon as this price opened, buyers were not strong, and scalpers were seen selling. The market hovered and declined to 907 yuan. After hearing that the foreign exchange market was quiet and there were no major changes, it rebounded to 912 yuan. According to half-day transaction statistics, 1,625 bales were traded.

Inland: 40  Fellow Dealers: 990
Total: 1,625

Local Cotton Prices Are Rising Daily

Local cotton trading is still dominated by inter-dealer buying and selling, mostly fire-damaged bales and white bales. Factory demand has not improved, but the sentiment is exceptionally strong, which is due to the scarcity of goods. As a result, the selling price has been increasing daily. North Road Taicang cotton has reached 207 yuan, and is still delivered from the warehouse. Tongzhou cotton is even scarcer, and the asking price is very high. There is no supply from northern Jiangsu. The current spot cotton transactions are listed on the left:

Tongzhou Cotton: 209.00 - Fellow Dealer Purchased 100 Bales
Small White Bales: 199.00 - Fellow Dealer Purchased 49 Bales

Also: 201.00 - Also 100 Bales

According to other news, the foreign cotton market price, the New York cotton market, was stable this morning. The price strengthened first due to purchases by speculators and then due to purchases by the industry. As a result, the closing price was 4-5 pound sounds higher than the previous day. The Indian price rose by another 2 rupees, and the Egyptian cotton market rose by more than 10 pound sounds.

Shanghai Foreign Cotton Trading

Shanghai's foreign cotton trading has been quite active recently, but all trading is between dealers. In recent days, spot goods on the market have been almost completely purchased.

### Grains: Large Quantities of Foreign Rice Arrived - Rice Hoarders Hard to Hold On

The rice market, which has been plummeting for days, saw a slight rebound the day before yesterday. Yesterday, the sentiment suddenly changed. Those who were willing to sell and those who were not were each found, and the market prices were inconsistent. At the opening, the original wholesale merchants held their goods and observed the situation, unwilling to let go. For the purchasing side, there were still many inquiries for No. 1 Saigon rice, so the buying situation for No. 1 Saigon rice was stable, and there were no ups and downs until the closing. However, for other goods, such as fire-ground rice and small-ground rice, there was little appetite, and trading was scarce. As a result, floating hoarders' morale was weakened again, and prices fell again. At one point, fire-ground rice was only sold for 43.5 to 43 yuan, small-ground rice was sold for 40 yuan, and inferior quality was sold for only 39 yuan. Inferior quality Tokyo peaked at 39.5 to 39.3 yuan, which was about 0.5 to 1 yuan lower than the previous closing price. After this, the market hovered all the way until the closing, with no changes. As for mixed broken rice and other market goods, in order to meet the needs of stable sales, the amount sold on the market was limited. The shops and retail outlets were welcomed by the general public and needed to meet retail sales, so sales were particularly strong, and yesterday, they were able to stand out with a gain of 0.3 to 0.5 yuan, with prices ranging from 35.5 yuan. Glutinous rice continued to be weak, falling by about 0.5 yuan. There was no news of trading outside the market for thick and thin japonica rice and early and late rice.

Although the foreign rice price from overseas has been reduced, after the Shanghai market's consecutive days of sharp declines, the sentiment is soft. Although the price reduction can be implemented, foreign customers do not dare to continue to order. The batches that were previously ordered are arriving one after another. Yesterday, another ship arrived and was waiting to be unloaded, and one or two more ships will arrive soon. The large quantity and huge amount of silver are enough to shake the stability of the large accounts, and the floating accounts are even more frightened. Yesterday, some customers from the countryside and shops took the opportunity to buy in small quantities, while the back-to-back futures remained difficult to trade. Although the cargo holders tried their best to maintain the prices, the result was that each continued to cut prices by 0.4 to 0.5 or 0.6 to 0.7 yuan. 4,500 bags of foreign rice were offered, but only more than 300 tons of futures were counted. No. 2 Siamese rice was 50 yuan, and No. 2 Saigon rice was 50.08 to 50.05 yuan. Mixed broken rice was 42.25 yuan plus commission. The counter-offer for small-ground rice in the afternoon was 48.5 yuan, which was not agreed upon.

Yesterday, another large batch of foreign rice arrived, managed by Java Company. The Sawah Loento, carried rice from Yangon to Shanghai. Entered port around 8:00 am yesterday. Approximately 4,500 tons were loaded, for a total of 45,000+ sacks and unloaded at the Pudong Blue Funnel wharf. The Ombi lin, also managed by Java Company, is scheduled to arrive from Saigon this afternoon. It is scheduled to dock at the Kung Ho Cheung wharf. The foreign rice loaded on this vessel is of the enormous amount of over 71,000 sacks. It is said that this foreign rice is managed by the Jian Yuan Company.

### Flour and Wheat Step Down

Flour: The market trended downstream yesterday. During the period of flat selling in the street, demand was of course slightly stronger. Although there were some embellishments from the mainland and rural villages, the number was limited. The main market was depressed due to the export ban. Only the high cost of raw materials and the limited number of back-to-back goods made it difficult to continue falling. There were few transactions yesterday morning. The market only started to open slightly later, and only the old car brand saw trading, with prices easing from 14.35 yuan to 14.3 yuan. There were only sporadic small transactions.

Wheat: The wheat market showed a setback yesterday, because most of the foreign wheat that had been ordered by various factories will arrive in Shanghai this month. Therefore, floating accounts are waiting and watching, and domestic factories' appetite is also stagnant. It is reported that the Nanyang banks and the Japanese factories have slightly purchased some goods. The opening price for Changshu wheat was 23.3 yuan, and the price for Suzhou wheat was 23.8 yuan. 500 bales were traded, which was a few cents lower than the previous price.

Imports: Yesterday, there were 1,600 pieces of raw oil, 100 pieces of soybean oil, and 448 bales of soybeans, all transported from Yantai.

Exports: Today, there are 650 bales of soybeans to be shipped to Xianggang [Hong Kong], and 1,000 bales of rice to be shipped to Tianjin.

### North-South Goods: Black Watermelon Seeds Gain More Momentum

Black watermelon seeds have recently been actively purchased by the Nanyang banks, and the supply is scarce. As a result, the price has risen sharply. Jikui has reached 90 yuan, Gaoxukui seeds are also close to 80 yuan, and Dalian seeds are 60 yuan. Those who have inventory are unwilling to sell immediately, which is a rare new high price in recent years.

### Sugar Market: Xinghua Green Slabs Rise by Two Yuan

According to Dutch telegrams, the sugar market C.I.F. K.G. rate is 9.55 Dutch Guilders which is one tenth of a Guilder less than before. The trend of the exchange rate is flat. The spot price of 24 crude white is unchanged. The wooden stack is 62.5 yuan. Newly arrived shipments in outside warehouses are 62.3 to 62.2 yuan, old shipments are 62 to 61.9 yuan. Transshipments are 49 yuan. Taigu's Car White is slightly tight, rising by 0.2-0.3 yuan. Western stack B Mark is 67 yuan, CW Mark is 66.5 yuan, CX Mark is 65 yuan, DY Mark is 64.2 yuan, and HX Mark is 63.7 yuan. Eastern stack goods are sold at discounted prices, and all other items are generally unremarkable. Chinese businesses and Hua banks opened 200 pieces of green slabs at 42.2 yuan (cash), which is nearly 2 yuan higher than before.

### Silk and Tea: Sales of Indian and Philippine Silk Still Difficult to Develop

The silk market rebounded in both the United States and Japan yesterday. New York prices rose by 0.125 for March and 0.095 for forward contracts. Yokohama spot prices rose by 40 yuan, and forward prices rose by 27 yuan. The local silk market, in light of the fatigue of previous silk prices, returned to Suzhou yesterday, and external sales intentions became strong. As a result, Dachang, Renji, and Lianna all had transactions. 75% of white factory sales were open for 60 tan at 5,050 yuan. 83% of electricity transactions previously made on the previous day were open for 10 tan at 5,100 yuan. Due to the long-silent silk market, it was quite lively. Sales of Indian and Philippine silk are still difficult to develop. The trend of the entire silk market is still unable to turn upwards. Four thousand pieces of tea will be transported to Tianjin on the 9th.

### Coal: Haifeng Coal is Firm, Exceeding Fireplace White Coal

Haifeng White Coal trading has not been lonely recently, due to limited old inventory and no new arrivals. At this time between the old and the new, sellers' intentions are quite firm and unwilling to devalue, so the market is firm, exceeding Fireplace White Coal. The opening price for Haifeng large lumps is 180 yuan per ton, screened lumps are 170 yuan, and general coal is 160 yuan per ton. Customers are charged extra for delivery.

### Wool Single-Faced Broadcloth: Still Extremely Popular

Yesterday, Friday, the woolen goods broadcloth market remained brisk and rising, with all goods generally in short supply. Single-faced broadcloth remains extremely popular, widely chosen for both Chinese and Western clothing, due to its sturdy, durable, and long-lasting qualities, resulting in strong sales. Unfortunately, British products are scarce and expensive. Manufacturers in Shanghai, due to high raw material costs, have mostly ceased production long ago. This has led to a significant shortage of goods in the market. The standard market price yesterday for British-made Grade A single-faced broadcloth was 33 yuan per yard wholesale, Grade B was 28 yuan, and Shanghai-made broadcloth typically sold for 15 or 16 yuan. Grade A Eastern goods sold for 19 yuan.

Old News Re-copied - Sixty-Seven Years Ago (218) (From our newspaper during the Tongzhi 12th year of the Qing Dynasty)

### Biography of Cui'e

Ji Sheng, named Ru Yu, was a native of Shanxi province, and a descendant of a prominent family. From a young age, he studied the classics and histories and had a free-spirited nature. Duke Donghai was the magistrate of Jingjiang and hired him. To the east of the town was Chong Sheng Temple, where incense was burned in great abundance. Distinguished women would come to worship like clouds. Ji Sheng, taking advantage of his leisure during a spring outing, strolled to observe. There was a young maiden with her hair in a bun, whose beauty was unsurpassed, graceful like a fairy. Sheng was so entranced and infatuated that he almost forgot to return. It happened that Sheng had a friend, Mr. Zhou, who lived near the maiden. Sheng then frequently visited him, intending to gain access to the girl. Zhou knew his hidden intention and jokingly said, "The red wall is so close, it makes one eagerly anticipate, but surely there is someone who can help." Sheng, surprised and suspicious, said, "You truly understand me, but without having met her or exchanged a letter, how can it be easy?" Zhou said, "The maiden's family has been engaged in needlework for a long time, and many come to buy, implying a search for a worthy man. I know this well. If I accompany you, we can pretend to buy her needlework." Sheng agreed. The next day, they went together and met an old woman with white hair, who was the maiden's mother. The maiden's name was Cui'e, she was eighteen years old, understood poetry, and had a firm and lofty ambition, unwilling to marry anyone but a man like Liang Hong. Sheng took the opportunity to flirt with her, and both the old woman and the maiden were agreeable. However, Sheng's father was strict and the family's status high, making it difficult to allow a match with the maiden's family. Nevertheless, Sheng was secretly pleased that there was a way, and gradually increased his visits. One day, the old woman and her relatives went to the countryside to celebrate a birthday. Sheng secretly and confidently went to Cui'e's residence. At that time, Cui'e was tired from embroidery and pacing under the flowers. Raising her eyes and seeing Sheng, she was surprised by his sudden arrival. Sheng stepped forward, bowed, and said, "I am deeply grateful for your previous letter, which intensifies my longing. If my humble sincerity could be a servant in your chamber, I would die without regret!" Cui'e lowered her head shyly, half-resisting and half-yielding. Before long, Sheng's family moved to Longshan and strongly invited him to visit. Sheng hesitated, unsure of what to do. He consulted Cui'e, who said, "Do not let your private feelings make me bear the burden of guilt." A few days later, Sheng went to the maiden's house again and heard the old woman crying sadly. Entering, he saw that Cui'e had hanged herself.

### The Soviet News Industry

— Xin Xu

"News is not only a collective propagandist and agitator but also a collective organizer." This is the characteristic of Soviet news. All news nationwide is managed under the supervision of party and government organs and trade unions. There is no private media outlet. This is completely different from the news industry in other countries. In the Soviet Union, there is also an "Industrial Correspondence Agency," which is directly linked to various news outlets. In addition to greatly helping the cause of national construction, it also has profound significance in understanding the real life of the people throughout the country. Therefore, the Soviet Union considers the news industry to be an important national institution.

In terms of the geographical distribution of news publications, there are four types: All-Union news, Republic news, provincial and local news, and administrative district news. In terms of the nature of society, there are general political news, industrial news, agricultural news, trade union news, Communist Party news, Young Communist League news, Young Pioneer news, women's news, and factory news, etc.

In terms of form, there are daily, bi-monthly, semi-weekly, weekly, ten-day, semi-monthly, monthly, quarterly, and annual publications, etc. The number of pages is generally four pages. The major Soviet news publications are as follows:

(1) Pravda (Truth), the news of the Soviet Union, is published daily with a circulation of over four million copies. It is the organ of the Federal Communist Party, founded on May 5, 1912, and is the oldest and only newspaper in the Soviet Union. Its chief editor is Molotov. The founding date of Pravda has now been designated as "Publication Day" in the Soviet Union.

(2) Izvestia (News), the organ of the Soviet government, is published daily with a circulation of 2.5 million copies. It was founded on February 18, 1917. Its chief editor is Bukharin, an authority in the news industry.

(3) Industrialization, with a total circulation of 800,000 copies daily, is the guiding news for the industrialization movement aimed at the Five-Year Plan and is the organ of the People's Committee for Heavy Industry.

(4) Economic Life, the joint organ of the Gosplan, the headquarters of planned economy, and the People's Committee of Finance, is published daily with a circulation of 200,000 copies.

(5) Peasant News, news for guiding the development of agricultural economy and collective farms, is directly under the Central Committee of the Party and is published every three days with a circulation of over three million copies.

(6) Red Star, the organ of the Revolutionary Military Committee, is published daily with a circulation of over 400,000 copies and is the publication of the highest national defense organ of the Federation.

(7) Komsomolskaya Pravda (Young Communist League Truth), the organ of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League, has a total daily circulation of over one million copies. However, the size of any news in Soviet Russia is very small. For example, Pravda, which has a daily circulation of four million copies, is only about the size of an ordinary newspaper. The reason is that there is no commercial competition in the Soviet Union, and commercial advertising is unnecessary. The space of a newspaper is enough to publish various important domestic and foreign news.

Psychology

### Children's Cries

— Jin Fan

We cannot deny that "a child's cry is an expression of unhappiness, lack of joy, and discomfort; it is the opposite of laughter." However, this is too narrow a definition. Humans are the most intelligent of all beings, so they have more planning and pretense than other animals. Children, due to hereditary factors from their parents, understand pretense, hypocrisy, and even deception and coercion from a very young age. Although they do not know these terms, they are indeed very good at using these skills. Their only means is "crying."

Crying does indeed make many parents feel overwhelmed. Watching their beloved child shed tears and cry incessantly troubles them, with pity and anger intermingling in their hearts. Thus, patient parents will comply with their children in every way, while impatient parents will hit their children. However, neither of these is a good way to deal with a child's crying.

Let's first talk about the disadvantages of "compliance"! For example, if your child wants candy and you don't agree, he cries loudly and continuously. At this time, you are annoyed by his crying and, on the other hand, pity him and comply with him. Then your child achieves victory and understands that this victory comes from "crying." He gets a revelation that crying will make everything come true, and he will often use crying to coerce you in the future.

As for "hitting," we have long recognized in education that "corporal punishment" is not a good way to educate children. It often makes children ignore the reason for the corporal punishment and instead fosters a distorted hatred in their hearts. Over time, this hatred takes root in his heart. We often see a child hating his father for this reason. Ordinary men are generally less gentle and considerate towards children than women. If "hitting" is used to cure a child's crying, it may have some effect, but it is not a real effect. It makes your child leave you, it makes your child fear you, so that there is an invisible wall between parents and children. We say that children are happy angels in the family and comforters of parents. When children lose their lively and innocent demeanor, what fun is there to talk about in this family?

So, how should we deal with children's crying? Mr. Chen Qin said, "Have sympathy for children" and "Be a companion to children." These two principles of child education, derived from experience, are the only way to deal with children's crying. As parents, do not simply "command" children according to your own wishes, because "children are not small-scale adults." Their psychology and physiology are completely different from adults. Adults should understand this point, observe children from their perspective, seek the reason for their crying each time, understand their desires and needs, and sympathize with them. Sympathy will make children trust you and be close to you. In this way, you can use the position of a companion to persuade and guide them according to their age and level. Use more metaphors, and children like to imitate. You can set a good example. This is the only rational way to deal with children's crying and can achieve very good results.

### The Place Where Blood Flowed

— Ma Zhujun

One day, I was waiting for the tram on Avenue Joffre.

I was surrounded by the sounds of people, cars, tram bells, and hawkers shouting, all the sounds of the city.

I saw countless crowds, like a long sea of people. Women wore beautiful fur coats, and men combed their hair neatly. I also saw many pot-bellied merchants and wealthy gentlemen, with cigars in their mouths, the neon lights shining on their bald heads, on the women in their arms, and on their triumphant smiling faces. I also saw those many vendors, carrying the burdens of life, looking at passers-by with pleading eyes, and uttering their tragic cries.

Suddenly, a cry of anguish caught my attention. In front of the tavern door, a young man in a suit was forcefully knocking down a rickshaw puller. I knew that the cry came from the person lying on the ground. He cried, got up from the ground, and tried to grab the young man's coat, but a powerful fist landed on his nose in quick succession. Blood spurted from the man's nose, staining his hand and coloring his collar red. He cried and screamed in fear, trying to hold the young man. But it was no use. The young man hit his head hard while using his hand to push open the glass doors and windows of the tavern.

The rickshaw puller was kicked by the beautiful leather shoes and knocked down again. The young man walked into the tavern proudly. The rickshaw puller followed, wanting to go in, but the servants inside blocked the door, giving him terrible looks. The rickshaw puller cried and shouted outside. Many people stood around. People told him to report it to the police. He wiped his swollen nose, wiped away the continuous stream of red blood, and staggered along the way. The police came, and many people breathed a sigh of relief. The police went into the tavern. The rickshaw puller helplessly wiped the blood outside. People told him to look up so the bleeding would stop. The police came out and looked helplessly at the rickshaw puller. Some unfair words rang out in the crowd. The police went back inside. People began to become dissatisfied. The glass doors and windows opened again. A fat servant showed a round face, covered with a false smile. His hand was holding a one-dollar new bill in front of the rickshaw puller, but many dissatisfied voices drove the round face back inside.

The police came out, still alone, said a few words to the rickshaw puller, and walked away alone. People started to discuss, some shouting injustice, some spitting harshly, some blushing, but some people moved their feet and walked away. The thin rickshaw puller leaned against the tree trunk, making slight moans, using his hand to adjust his swollen nose, using his hand to caress the wounds on his body, and using his sleeves to wipe away the continuous stream of red blood.

I forgot about the trams passing by one after another. I listened to the groans of life's struggles. My tears welled up in my eyes. Another rickshaw puller glanced at me and asked if I needed a ride. I trembled in terror and looked at him blankly before leaving the place where the neon lights shone on a place where blood had flowed.

A groan under the high pressure of life echoed in my ears. I saw countless unfortunate people before my eyes. In order to make life a little better, they would be beaten, kicked, and even bleed. Many rickshaw pullers offered me business along the way. I shook my head. I was not one of those proud young men. In order to make my own life better, could I also beat others, even to the point of causing them to bleed?

The sounds of the city, I could no longer listen to these struggling groans. (With a reward)

Essay

### No Spring

— Wang Tao

The calendar tells me it is already spring. But I haven't heard any news of spring at all, nor have I felt the warmth of spring. I still feel like I live in the cold ice cellar of severe winter...

Gusts of cold wind blow into the small room, and outside the window flutters a misty spring snow. A cool emotion presses tightly on my heart, and I gradually feel suffocated by life.

I begin to immerse myself in painful thoughts. Then I remember a story, a story about a giant.

...Because the giant was selfish, he did not allow any children to play in his garden, so his garden was always occupied by severe winter. Although several seasons have changed outside, his garden is still filled with flying snowflakes, howling north winds, and bare tree branches... Here, there is only severe winter, no spring.

I also thought of this "island" where we now live...

The cost of living climbs endlessly, and hoarding and manipulation have become a temporary trend. Starving corpses of thousands of people on the brink of death lie at the doors of rice shops, even though the doors are piled high with the rice they seek day and night but cannot obtain!

Is there any spring on this "island"? Let thousands of people on the verge of death warm their cold hearts, let thousands of people on the verge of suffocation breathe some fresh air.

However, there is no spring on the "island". This is a frozen wasteland, a terrible wasteland.

But we eagerly look forward to news of spring! However, there is no spring on the "island"...

### Talking Points

— Jin Ni

In the Gigo Forest in the Antibe region on the northern shore of Lake Victoria in central Africa, the breasts of men are generally more developed than those of women.

The plants growing on the Lugegera Volcano in Albert National Park in the Belgian Congo are too numerous to count, including plant species from the hot, temperate, and cold zones. It can be called the world's most complete botanical garden.

The place with the most bridges in the world is Venice, Italy, with more than four hundred bridges in the entire area.

According to the recent research results of the great American astronomer Professor Clark, there are two ways the Earth will be destroyed: one is that it will be scorched and melted by the sun's light and heat; the other is that the Earth will be impacted and shattered by a group of mysterious comets in space. However, this event is likely to occur millions of years later.

### The Art of Listening (1)

At railway crossings, there is always a sign that says, "Stop, look carefully, listen attentively." These few words, though brief, are very important because they can prevent accidents and save lives, preventing people from suffering unwarranted disasters. From this, we can think about how important these two human instincts - seeing and hearing - are to the individual. If used properly, they can make their lives excellent and upward; if used improperly, they can lead to many disasters, even death. A few weeks ago, we talked about how people should "see." Today, we will discuss the instinct of "hearing." Please pay attention. One day, some people brought a deaf and mute person to see Jesus. They knew that Jesus was a famous doctor, so they came specifically to ask Jesus to heal the person. Jesus called the person away from the crowd, put his fingers in his ears, spit on his tongue, sighed deeply to heaven, and then said, "Open." Sure enough, the person's ears were opened, and his tongue was able to speak freely. But the person has taken on a major responsibility ever since! Jesus understands this, so he sighs deeply to heaven before healing his illness. We ordinary people are the same. We enable people to speak and hear, and at the same time, we give him two major responsibilities. His future is dark or bright, depending on whether he knows how to use these two instincts, "hearing" and "seeing." Originally, "hearing" is an art, and everyone should cultivate it carefully. We have a pair of ears, and everyone except deaf people can hear things. This is instinctive hearing. Jesus meant that it is not enough for people to just be able to hear. They have to know how to "hear." He said, "Whoever has ears, let him hear." He meant to teach people to listen to things in the way of Christ. Normally, all kinds of sounds, such as crying, shouting, noise, talking, music, etc., can be heard clearly by everyone without effort. Even the doctrines preached today, you can all hear them, but this topic is derived from the words of Jesus. What did Jesus mean when he said this? Maybe you haven't heard it. When we listen, we don't listen to the superficial sounds. We must be able to understand the unspoken meaning. This is the most important thing.

### Li Chunlai and Chun Gui Yuan

— Xi Sen

Previously, Mr. Xu Muyun's Records of Pear Garden Anecdotes described Yang Xiaolou's admiration for Li Chunlai, which shows that Chunlai can be regarded as the chief among martial actors in the South without shame. But there is one more thing about Chunlai that is worth mentioning, that is, at that time, he and the Shanghai courtesan Zhu Guizhen founded Chun Gui Yuan, which was magnificent. Few people know that it was the first to establish the grand architectural style of later theaters. Now, I will describe it:

First, there was Zhu Guizhen, a proofreader from Wumen, who ran an incense nest in Gongyang Lane on Sanma Road. She was wild and arrogant and did not get along well with her guests. One day, she wore a Western-style suit and toured Zhang's Wei Chun Garden. Her waist was so slender, she was graceful like a willow in the wind. A Jing Official, Huang, saw her and was infatuated with her. That night, he summoned her to serve wine, and a romantic relationship was established. In less than a month, he ordered her mother to bring her home with ten dou of bright pearls and one hundred taels of silver and placed her in the ranks of golden hairpins. Zhu was intelligent and had a rough understanding of literature since childhood. She often envied young and handsome men like Huang Da Ba when she read novels. She felt that Jing Official Huang was too weak and self-pitying that he was not her mate. So, she used the Pear Garden singing halls as a place to relieve her boredom. At that time, Li Chunlai was performing in a garden, known for his martial arts plays. Guizhen went there every day and lingered there. After a long time, they became close and openly acted like a couple. Although people gossiped about the shame of adultery, some critics even used Jing Official as a warning. However, Chunlai knew that Guizhen had accumulated a lot of wealth, so he had no scruples. One day, Chunlai was on stage, Guizhen arrived late and could not get a seat with the audience. She returned home in great anger and discussed with Chunlai to open a garden alone. Li had long harbored this idea, so he stopped performing at a garden and rented a new site, facing the garden across the street. The architecture and decoration were extremely luxurious, and the decorations were beautiful and unique, the best of all theaters at the time. It was named Chun Gui, after the names of the two. Since then, they went back and forth together, like a couple. Soon, Chunlai was arrested for something, Guizhen used money to bribe officials everywhere, and she did not change her attitude because Chunlai was arrested. Some say that Chunlai's fame was largely due to Guizhen's efforts, and the establishment of Chun Gui Yuan was just the rest of it. I don't know if that's true?

### From Xishan to Shanghai

— Traveling Reporter

In the Chinese film industry of 1940, a brilliant newcomer was discovered. She is Ziwei, who went from Xishan to Shanghai. Eighteen years ago, Ningbo's "Xishan" Village left a new sprout in the old and beautiful wilderness. Ziwei has a miracle, a black mole about the size of a small dove egg on her left arm.

Her past, a long string of life fragments created by naughty and active blood and tears, has dominated school life, family life, and sports, dancing, and now theatrical life.

Three months ago, she was hired as a basic actor under the efforts of Yihua's recruitment and discovery of new talents. On the day she signed the contract, she completed her screen debut in the blockbuster "The Assassination of the King of Qin" overnight.

Her original name was Wang Lizhen. She used to study at a church girls' school, but she also jumped onto Huoshan and Datong, where she spent ten months as a dancer. However, she was too tired of that life without seeing the sun.

Ziwei is five feet two inches tall and weighs 105 pounds, which is the standard condition for Hollywood stars. Her physique and appearance are also healthy and beautiful. After "The Assassination of the King of Qin," Yihua assigned her the more arduous role of the eldest princess in "Guanyin," which shows how much they valued her is an iron fact.

She, Ziwei, "Now I just want to be quiet for a while and use my limited life to cultivate endless life." She told reporters that she would change and make her character and will serious.

From Xishan to Shanghai, in a chance encounter, Ziwei told herself a long string of light and beautiful stories like wisps of smoke, her smile like spring in March, and her soft and harmonious tune like the south wind made people aspire to her bright future like strong black coffee.

### The Film Star's Health and Beauty in Taylor Holmes's Mouth

— Yeshuo

John Weissmuller is an athlete who is six feet four inches tall and weighs 190 pounds. He is best at swimming and has won the world swimming championship.

He once said to people, "Hollywood female stars are getting healthier and more beautiful every day. The main reason is exercise. After practicing for a long time, their complexion becomes better, their eyes are bright, and their bodies become healthier and more beautiful."

He also gave many examples, saying, "Joan Crawford is diligent in exercise and has great perseverance. She has a good understanding of dancing and swimming. Jeannette MacDonald is good at tennis and badminton. Myrna Loy is not only a swimmer but also plays badminton well. Loretta Young and Bette Davis are equestrian experts..."

Finally, Weissmuller said, "I am not a beauty doctor, but I know the value of exercise. It can make Hollywood female stars healthier and more beautiful."

### The Purpose of Watching Movies

— Yuan Shan

In a previous issue, Mr. Xinliang's article "The Purpose of Watching Movies" described the reasons many people watch movies. Now, I, the author, will write about another purpose below.

Probably the majority of moviegoers are children aged eight to sixteen. They love martial arts movies. Their purpose is to watch the flying over roofs and walls, riding the clouds and mist, and the dancing with swords and spears, and other martial arts skills depicted in the films.

Speaking of the purpose of watching movies, in addition to what Xinliang said, "Watching movies should not only be for leisure, entertainment; we should absorb various new learning and new knowledge from those good movie scripts," we should also cultivate our morality and personality, and improve our lives and habits. Now, I will briefly write about one or two examples of past domestic films that meet the above points:

The film "The Gate of Flesh and Spirit" by the former Minxin Film Company can indeed move many people. Its gist is about a family of four—a loving mother, a clever older brother, an innocent younger brother, and a father who is addicted to alcohol and gambling. The whole family is in an extremely miserable state because of a father who does not know how to improve himself. Later, after the older brother's long-term patience, gentle and touching behavior, and earnest persuasion, he awakened a father without a soul, who abandoned evil and returned to righteousness, repented and started anew, thus gaining his new life, and thereafter lived a harmonious and happy new life.

Lianhua's "Tian Lun" (Filial Piety) serves the people with the spirit of "Respect the elderly as you would your own, and cherish the young as you would your own," with the aim of achieving spiritual happiness as the main theme.

The recently released first installment of "Wen Su Chen" by Hezong depicts two women who were devoted to serving Wen Su Chen, but while they were interested, he remained indifferent. Wen Su Chen steadfastly refused them because he already had a wife. Our country has always emphasized the chastity of women, and I say, why shouldn't men also be able to obtain peace of mind and body?

I believe that the importance of spiritual nourishment far outweighs that of physical nourishment. I wonder if you all agree?

### Jin Suqin Stars in "Wenji Returns to Han," Overseas Chinese Prepare to Open New Company in Shanghai

— Haixing

Recently, several overseas Chinese who operate film businesses in the Philippines plan to open a film production company in Shanghai. They have been actively preparing for three or four months. The person in charge is a certain Mr., a film industry giant who has been retired since the war.

The company's plan is quite ambitious, but the person in charge claims that it is not yet time to announce it, so we can only reveal this much information for now. It is heard that the company's first film is tentatively set as "Wenji Returns to Han," and Jin Suqin has been invited to play the role of Wenji. The company is scheduled to be established in late April, so it does not conflict with Jin Suqin's trip to Hong Kong for performances.

Most of the personnel of this new company, such as directors, actors, and other technical personnel, are invited back from the rear (wartime locations). Therefore, once this company is established, it will surely refresh our senses.
