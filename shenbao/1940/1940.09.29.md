### Repercussions of the German-Italian-Japanese Alliance: The U.S. Expedites Aid to China and Britain; Welles Condemns Japan's Disruption of the Far East Status Quo; U.S. Prepared for Any Eventuality

Washington – After reading the document of the new tripartite military agreement signed in Berlin by Germany, Italy, and Japan, President Roosevelt convened an emergency meeting of the entire cabinet here yesterday at 3:00 PM (4:00 AM this morning, Shanghai time). Out of caution, the President avoided discussing the matter of banning scrap iron exports, intending to sanction Japan. He only expressed doubt about reports that the U.S. would transport a large number of bombers to Britain. Secretary of State Hull told reporters yesterday that the signing of the tripartite military agreement was expected. It was because of this consideration that Washington had taken actions such as lending $25,000,000 to China and banning the export of scrap iron to sanction Japan. Hull said, "According to the U.S.'s understanding, this military agreement does not substantially change the situation that has existed for several years. The announcement now merely clarifies the existing relationships. The signing of this agreement was anticipated, and the U.S. considered this point when deciding its foreign policy." Congress temporarily refused to criticize this military alliance, acknowledging that Japan's move would affect the U.S.'s future foreign policy but refraining from further comment. However, some anticipate more active developments between Britain and the U.S. in the near future. One Congressman said that Japan's adherence to the Rome-Berlin axis is entirely similar to the secret understanding between Italy and Germany before Italy joined the European war.

Washington – Official circles here declared last night that the U.S. is not particularly disturbed by the establishment of the new pact between Germany, Italy, and Japan, and will continue to aid Britain in all ways short of war. The new German-Italian-Japanese pact merely crystallizes a situation that was already evident but not formally confirmed. As far as can be seen, the U.S. will continue to maintain its current attitude toward the Far Eastern situation and insist on maintaining the status quo. Since the talk of a German-Italian-Japanese alliance in 1937, U.S. policy has recognized the three countries as potential allies. This is the reason for the expansion of the U.S. Navy. The current pact is a declaration to the American people that the European war is not an event unrelated to others, but part of a global act of aggression. (Reuters, 28th)

Cleveland, Ohio – U.S. Under Secretary of State Welles delivered a speech to the Foreign Affairs Council today, reiterating the U.S.'s intention to provide Britain with all material assistance. It is said that any problems in the Far East can be resolved peacefully through negotiation, but the U.S. government is prepared for any eventuality. Given the new pact between the Axis powers and Japan, this speech is considered to have special significance. He also condemned Japan's attack on Vietnam as a threat to the integrity of French colonies, in violation of the Japanese government's promise to respect the status quo. (Reuters, 28th)

Washington – The U.S. government will provide greater assistance to nations fighting totalitarian countries in both the Eastern and Western Hemispheres to counter the German-Italian-Japanese alliance. Secretary of State Hull clearly stated last night that the response to the Axis powers' intimidation of the U.S. will be increased arms exports to Britain, increased moral and material assistance to China, and increased economic pressure on Japan. (International News Service, 28th)

Washington – Following the emergency meeting of the entire cabinet convened by President Roosevelt yesterday afternoon, it is believed here that the U.S. will further assist Britain in response to the recent establishment of the tripartite military agreement between Japan and other countries. The President was unusually busy yesterday, holding important consultations with government leaders at the White House, but the outcome of the consultations has not been officially stated. British Ambassador Lothian and the editor of the London Economist both went to the White House to consult with the President for fifteen minutes. The main topic of discussion was increasing U.S. aid to Britain. It is said that members of the British diplomatic community are urging the President, and a non-official U.S. delegation has also expressed support for increased aid and requested the President to implement it. It is reported that Roosevelt has accepted. (Associated Press, 28th)

Washington – According to political figures close to the White House here, after implementing the embargo on iron scrap to Japan, the U.S. will take further retaliatory measures to prevent Japan's further actions in Asia. It is expected that the step following the iron scrap embargo will be a gasoline embargo. Political figures continued to say that the ultimate goal of the U.S. will be to completely halt trade relations between the U.S. and Japan. (Haitong News Agency, 28th)

U.S. Warships Sail to the Philippines

Honolulu – Unofficial sources here claimed last night that part of the U.S. fleet left Honolulu last week for the Philippines. Other fleets, including an aircraft carrier, may leave Hawaii for the Philippines at any time. It is believed here that the reason the Navy ordered an aircraft carrier to the Philippines is to show Washington's intention to strengthen the "flying destroyer" long-range bomber capabilities in the Philippines. Some speculate that the dispatch of multiple warships to the Philippines is a routine deployment, but the large number of warships sufficiently demonstrates that the U.S. naval strength in the Far East has been greatly enhanced. (Associated Press, 28th)

Washington – The Navy Department announced last night that the signing of the tripartite military agreement yesterday has significantly changed the world situation, so the U.S. fleet's plan to sail from Hawaii to the mainland must also be changed. Whether these warships will still return to Hawaii has not been definitively stated by the Navy Department. (Associated Press, 28th)

Washington – Political circles here claim that the U.S. will continue to oppose Japan's demands or threats, whether they concern American interests in Shanghai or other parts of China, or areas that the U.S. has declared must maintain the original status quo and must not be forcibly changed under threat of force, such as the Dutch East Indies. The U.S. government and most members of Congress believe that the formal alliance between Germany, Italy, and Japan only draws public attention to a situation that has long existed, and which the U.S. had fully considered when formulating its national defense policy in early 1938. Secretary of State Hull issued a statement after meeting with the President, stating that the German-Italian-Japanese alliance has not substantially changed the situation. Officials said that the U.S. had taken into account the close collusion between Germany, Italy, and Japan when formulating Pan-American policy, which is tantamount to declaring that the U.S. will continue to adopt the same policy. The U.S. government does not want to succumb to Japan's threats, especially since these threats appear to stem from a weak rather than a strong position. In other words, the conclusion of this treaty is largely due to Germany's failure to conquer Britain and Japan's failure in China. Tokyo and Berlin feel the need to boost morale at home. In reality, Germany and Japan are not in a position to help each other. As for the idea that Japan can seize the Dutch East Indies or British Malaya to obtain raw materials such as rubber, oil, and tin, it is not worth taking seriously. Japan is unwilling to fight against first-rate powers. It is said that one thing that could make U.S. public opinion support drastic action is the U.S. openly acting where its vital interests are deemed to be threatened. Japan's actions that disregard international law and morality may not be enough to stir up public opinion, but Japan completely disregards the U.S.'s wishes and directly endangers the U.S.'s interests. Japan is cooperating with Germany and Italy to establish and maintain a new order, but mutual assistance between Germany, Italy, and Japan will only be realized when a country not currently involved in the war attacks one of the contracting parties. This vague formulation seems to only concern Japan when a third country, such as the U.S., joins the war. However, it is unknown whether this treaty will apply when Egypt is at war with Italy. (Reuters, 28th)

London – The current view here is that the attempt by the Rome-Berlin axis to woo Spain after forming an alliance with Japan indicates that Germany's current war situation will continue for a long time. At the same time, the blitz tactics against Britain have failed, so German leader Hitler is eager to find new allies. British commentators believe that the only thing Germany can gain from Japan's joining the Berlin-Rome axis is propaganda value. A British official said, "As I see it, Japan has joined an alliance that is of no benefit to it and is likely to invite a task that it cannot handle on its own." All sectors in Britain believe that this new alliance is a clamorous "threat" to the U.S. The first reaction to the treaty last night was that it was only an empty intimidation. As far as informed circles know, the British believe that it cannot affect the general situation at present. Furthermore, Germany and Italy will absolutely not be able to take stronger action against Britain with Japan's help. In private, the British government is not at all surprised by this move. (Associated Press, 28th)

London – London's newspapers unanimously mocked the tripartite alliance. The "Daily Mail" said that the alliance is similar to the previous Anti-Comintern Pact and is not at all frightening. However, the current tripartite alliance no longer opposes Bolshevism. Their current common goal is to build a "new order" in Europe and Asia. The newspaper also said that it is obvious that this alliance is aimed at the U.S. and the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union may be interested in one thing: that the relationship between the three allied countries and the Soviet Union will not undergo major changes. However, it should feel that, in any case, the intention of this treaty is to "freeze out" the Soviet Union. (Associated Press, 28th) benefits, then U.S. public opinion may not forgive it. (Reuters, 28th)

New York – New York newspapers recently published news of the German-Italian-Japanese Berlin agreement in large headlines and prominent positions, regarding this military alliance as an anti-U.S. action. All newspapers believe that this new alliance is an attempt by totalitarian states to prevent the U.S. from participating in the European war or to force the U.S. to cope with wars on both the Eastern and Western fronts simultaneously. The first commentary on this new agreement was an editorial in the New York Sun. The newspaper said that the alliance is clearly a warning to the U.S. not to interfere in the wars currently taking place in other parts of the world. The newspaper also said that the Berlin agreement is a sharp response to President Roosevelt's announced steel embargo aimed at Japan. The signatory countries of this new agreement have at least indicated that they do not want to offend the Soviet Union at this time. The newspaper also said that the jubilation of Spanish newspapers about this agreement shows that, regardless of whether Spain joins this agreement, the Spanish government approves of this alliance of dictatorial countries. (Associated Press, 28th)

London – A Reuters diplomatic correspondent commented on the new treaty between Germany, Italy, and Japan, saying that Japan can be said to have been dragged into a treaty that instead of helping itself, makes it solely responsible for difficult tasks. Germany and Italy are currently exerting all their efforts to

Britain Believes Japan Is Trapped and Will Not Affect the European War

attack Britain, and cannot supply Japan with its raw materials or other goods, while Japan must instead contribute to Germany and Italy. One of the clauses of the treaty is clearly aimed at the U.S. The main purpose of this treaty is nothing more than to keep the U.S. out of the war. The special reservation regarding the Soviet Union seems to indicate that the signatory countries are not concerned about the Soviet Union. Judging from the full text of the published treaty, the situation will not undergo major changes as a result. If there are no secret clauses, this treaty should have no impact on the war between Britain and the Axis powers. This treaty merely declares Japan's state of belligerency rather than neutrality.

### The Tripartite Agreement Cannot Shake China's Determination to Resist Japan; It Will Instead Facilitate a Stronger Democratic Front; The Chinese Government Will Issue a Formal Statement

Chongqing – Official sources here recently stated that the establishment of the German-Italian-Japanese military and economic alliance is not surprising, and that it cannot shake China's determination to resist Japan and achieve final victory in the slightest. Officials also said that China can definitely obtain substantial assistance from the Soviet Union. This agreement will not be as bad for China as generally imagined, because it can enable democratic countries to form a strong united front and can enable China to obtain more active assistance from Britain and the U.S. Officials also said that the Chinese government recognizes the Soviet Union as a neutral party between democratic and totalitarian countries, so its assistance to China will not be affected. Authoritative observers say that Britain and the U.S. may adopt a stronger Far Eastern policy than before as a result. The Ta Kung Pao, in an editorial summarizing the contents of the agreement, said that the agreement is nothing more than (1) mutually recognizing the "new order in Europe and Asia," causing Germany and Italy to adopt a hostile attitude towards China, (2) the "non-participating country" mentioned in the agreement clearly refers to the U.S., because the U.S. is forcibly considered an ideal enemy, and (3) specifically mentioning the Soviet Union to keep the Soviet Union neutral. These three points are enough to show that a war between the U.S. and Japan is about to break out. (Associated Press, 28th)

Chongqing – Regarding the signing of the military alliance between Germany, Italy, and Japan, it is reported that the Chinese government is likely to issue a formal statement tonight to clarify China's position on this alliance. In addition, how China's diplomatic representatives in Germany and Italy will be handled in the future is also under consideration by the authorities. (Havas, 28th)

Editorial

### An Analytical View of the Tripartite Pact

The military, political, and economic alliance treaty between Germany, Italy, and Japan was formally signed in Berlin the other day. This is a major international event today, but it is definitely not an unexpected or accidental event. It has been brewing for a long time, with repeated observations and repeated setbacks, until recently, when it was finally necessary to make a decision and complete the procedure. This is not creating a new situation, but rather bringing a phase to a close. After Japan joined the Anti-Comintern Pact, there was already a proposal for a further alliance at that time. In the past, Germany and Italy had repeatedly urged Japan to accept this proposal, but Japan hesitated. Germany and Italy then set Japan aside and concluded the so-called "Steel Pact" between the two countries. As time passed, the situation became difficult. Japan suffered diplomatic setbacks everywhere, except for sharing a morsel of Vietnam from the mouths of Germany and Italy. Germany's blitz tactics also failed to achieve success in one go, and the European war, following the Far Eastern war, became a frozen situation. The attitude of the U.S. was repeatedly tested and proved to be firm. In short, the facts show that the strategy of quick victory and quick decision of both Germany and Japan has achieved the opposite result. Thus, the two opposites combined, abandoning their respective sneaky tactics and returning to the path of jointly pulling the ox. For two years, everyone has seen through that this is an inevitable trend, but under the consciousness of settling matters, it is inevitable to hope that it will not be so. Therefore, the eventual realization of the tripartite alliance is definitely not unexpected. This is the first point worth pointing out.

The sparks in Liaoning were not extinguished in time, and the war spread like wildfire, eventually involving the whole world, almost becoming the world long ago. It was destined. The establishment of the tripartite alliance only proves the inevitability of a world war and explains that the great war is getting closer and closer. However, it does not mean that the great war will start here. Now it is only a prelude to the great war. In other words, in the near future, the European war will still be the European war, and the Far Eastern war will still be the Far Eastern war. For a time, they will not be mixed into one. The reason is that the nature of the tripartite alliance is passive rather than active. It is an empty shell rather than an explosive. Its most important provision regarding so-called mutual assistance can only be invoked after a third country has joined the European war or the Far Eastern war. Even in terms of mutual assistance, apart from echoing from afar and shouting in unison, there is actually no way to devote efforts to each other, and the solution to Vietnam is the most wonderful exception that is not within the alliance. This is the second point worth pointing out.

There are six articles in the alliance treaty, which is very simple. The first article is "wishful thinking," and the second article is "calculation." How will Germany lead Britain? How will Japan lead China? Anyway, they have already broken off relations and are at war. Let's just write a few articles of the alliance to take advantage of the paper. It can also be considered a moment of pleasure, and it is not necessary to discuss it. However, Europe is not just Britain, and Asia is not just China. According to reports, Spain will join the German-Italian axis. According to the first article of the alliance, Japan must recognize and respect Germany's leadership of Spain. Can it not ask General Franco what he thinks? As for the so-called Greater East Asia, according to Japanese sources, the scope extends as far as the Dutch East Indies. How the Dutch East Indies will accept leadership is a question that is not discussed for the time being. However, between China and the Dutch East Indies, there is also the Philippines. The alliance forgot to list it as an exception. According to the second article of the alliance, Germany and Italy must of course recognize and respect Japan's right to lead it. However, when they signed the agreement, they forgot to tell the U.S. to sign a word as well. Countries like Turkey, which straddle Europe and Asia, unlike the Soviet Union, which is granted special treatment by explicit provisions, should probably flatter both sides and accept leadership from both sides!

The third article of the alliance is the most intimidating, stipulating that "if one of the signatory countries is attacked by a country that is not yet involved in the European war or the Far Eastern war, the three countries shall provide mutual assistance in the political, economic, and military spheres." On the surface, this article is the most important, that is, the so-called alliance. However, upon further review, one can realize its true meaning: First, this article is equivalent to declaring that the European war and the Far Eastern war are two completely separate matters. Assuming that the current situation changes slightly, Japan still maintains a policy of non-intervention in the European war, and Germany and Italy do not help Japan invade China in the Far Eastern war. Therefore, the essence of this article is only to prevent a third country from standing on the side of Britain or China and participating in the war. The so-called third country here, of course, primarily refers to the U.S. (although the Soviet Union, Turkey, and Greece also have the possibility of being regarded as targets). However, even in the case of the U.S., the problem is not simple. The so-called "being attacked" must have a clear explanation in terms of degree. For example, does the U.S. continuing to supply Britain with airplanes and warships count as attacking Germany and Italy? Second, assuming that the situation truly meets the conditions for applying Article 3, how can the three countries truly "provide mutual assistance in the political, economic, and military spheres?" These seem to be practical technical issues. Examining the reality, they have already fought with all their strength on their own. How can they still help each other? Assuming that the U.S. assumes the defense of Singapore and Hong Kong on behalf of Britain, and all of Britain's military equipment in East Asia is transferred to Europe to fight Germany and Italy, what do you ask Germany and Italy to do with Japan? And what can Japan do? What dare it do? If Japan is willing to send warships to the Atlantic or the Mediterranean to assist in the war, honestly, the three countries would have formed an alliance long ago, without waiting until today. If the U.S. takes further action in East Asia based on Singapore and Hong Kong, what can Germany and Italy do to help Japan? Therefore, the third article of the alliance seems very serious at first glance, but it is actually very hollow upon closer examination. Germany is still just Germany, and Japan is still just Japan. One plus one divided by two is still equal to one. It has not added a single point. As for the fifth article of the alliance, the so-called tripartite alliance does not affect the Soviet Union. This can be compared with the Anti-Comintern Pact, which the three countries have not declared abolished. They regard the white bear as a silly bird, and the big white bear can also pretend to be stupid for the time being. The sixth article of the alliance stipulates a valid period of ten years. It is a stock phrase in the articles, a prayer of the "long life and wealth" type. In today's world where all treaties can be torn up at will, it is appropriate not to pay attention to it.

Of course, we do not think that this tripartite alliance is a joke. Although the tripartite alliance is not accidental, and not a creation, it marks the end of a chaotic two years and the end of a phase. After this phase, we shall see a clear and firm development in the international situation. The causes and consequences will be discussed further.

### German, Italian, and Japanese Foreign Ministers Converse: Matsuoka to Visit Berlin and Rome; Alleged Xinjiang Border Issue to Be Submitted for Discussion; Japanese Side Claims No Change in Non-Interference Policy for Now

Berlin: Following the signing of the German-Italian-Japanese Tripartite Pact, Ribbentrop, Ciano, and Matsuoka Yosuke communicated with each other via wireless. The German Foreign Minister stated to the Japanese Foreign Minister: "The German-Italian-Japanese Tripartite Pact has been signed and established by your country's ambassador, Oshima, Ciano, and my plenipotentiary representatives on behalf of the three governments, taking immediate effect. I am exceedingly pleased. This historically significant action sufficiently demonstrates the friendly relations and common interests of the three countries. The success of this pact is entirely due to your efforts, for which I am deeply grateful. I believe this pact will surely benefit the people of the three countries, prevent factors that prolong the war, and restore peace as soon as possible. I believe you share the same sentiment. Because of the long distance, you were unable to come to Berlin to participate in the grand occasion, which Ciano and I deeply regret. We earnestly hope that you can come to visit Berlin and Rome as soon as possible, for which both countries wholeheartedly welcome you." The Italian Foreign Minister Ciano stated to Matsuoka Yosuke, "At this important juncture, I have come to Berlin to sign the German-Italian-Japanese Tripartite Pact with the German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and your country's ambassador to Germany, Oshima. This action realizes the wishes of the Italian Prime Minister and promotes the connection between the three countries. I am extremely honored to be able to participate in this grand event. I believe that this pact will be greatly beneficial to the future world history. Please convey my friendship and admiration for your country to all levels of your government." Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka Yosuke then answered, expressing satisfaction with the Tripartite Pact, and asked the German Foreign Minister to convey the congratulations of the Japanese government to the German head of state and the German government, and promised to visit Berlin as soon as possible. He then asked the German Foreign Minister to convey his thanks to the Italian Foreign Minister, informing him that he would definitely visit Rome when he visits Berlin. (Haitong News Agency, 28th)

Berlin: Authoritative sources here declared at a gathering for foreign journalists that the German-Italian-Japanese Tripartite Pact has no mission to adopt a new attitude towards American policy. Regarding the question of whether this pact is a warning to the United States, the reply was that if the German government's statement on the pact had mentioned certain individuals in democratic countries attempting to prolong the war and obstruct the true interests of various countries, this could indeed be found in the United States. If one could pay a little attention to certain parts of the administration in the United States today, without criticizing American policy, one could find that most of these people wish to plunge the world into war. This is their characteristic. The German authoritative source continued that the question of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere is a concept of political dynamics and is only related to Japanese policy. As for the boundary issues of the new order that will occur, they will be submitted for discussion and decided at the appropriate time. (Haitong News Agency, 28th)

Berlin: Berlin authorities believed last night that this new tripartite alliance is an "application of Japan's new policy." The first action of this new policy was Japan's invasion of Vietnam. Authoritative circles declared that the German Foreign Minister's speech yesterday stated that "warmongers" can mostly be found in the United States. Authoritative circles issued this statement because someone had asked whether the new agreement was directed at the United States. Berlin authorities also pointed out that Japan's southward policy can alleviate pressure on the Soviet Union. Therefore, this new alliance cannot be regarded as aimed at the Soviet Union. (Associated Press, 28th)

Berlin: On the day the German-Italian-Japanese Tripartite Pact was signed, the German head of state sent telegrams to the Italian King, the Italian Prime Minister, and the Japanese Emperor to express his regards. The German Foreign Minister also sent a telegram to the Japanese Prime Minister Konoe to express his delight. Furthermore, Hitler awarded the Grand Cross of the German Eagle to the Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka and the Japanese Ambassador to Germany, Oshima. The Japanese Emperor also awarded decorations to the German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop yesterday. (Haitong News Agency, 28th)

Rome: After the signing of the Tripartite Pact, the Italian King sent a telegram to the Japanese Emperor to express his sincere sentiments. The Italian Foreign Minister also sent a telegram to the Japanese Foreign Minister to express his regards. (Haitong News Agency, 28th)

Rome: According to a semi-official warning, if the United States dares to intervene in the European conflict with an attitude favoring Britain, the United States will be subjected to naval and land attacks from both oceans. This warning is part of an essay by the Italian Prime Minister's mouthpiece, Gayda, commenting on the German-Italian-Japanese alliance. Gayda declared in his newspaper that the strength of the Axis powers has greatly increased since Japan joined the alliance, because Japan's navy ranks third in the world. He claimed that the Japanese army is now also under the deployment of Germany and Italy. (Associated Press, 28th)

Rome: Italian Foreign Ministry Ambassador Rocco declared yesterday afternoon at an information conference here that the important significance of the signing of the German-Italian-Japanese Tripartite Pact during the European and East Asian wars goes without saying. This pact will definitely build a new world order and a new world peace. At the same time, this pact also serves as a warning to other countries' politicians not to interfere in the important issues and spheres of existence of Germany, Italy, and Japan. Rome hopes that the signing of the pact will immediately promote the development of the situation. Residents of Rome eagerly awaited the evening newspaper last night to read the record of this historical event. (Haitong News Agency, 28th)

The Process of the Three Countries Concluding the Treaty: Activities of a Secret German Envoy Staying in Japan

Tokyo: According to Japanese sources, the German special envoy and confidential messenger of the German Foreign Minister, Stahmer (49 years old), has played an important role in the conclusion of the Tripartite Pact since arriving in Japan on September 7. Reportedly, the "mysterious person" Stahmer came to Tokyo with his wife this time, and made a stopover in Moscow while traveling through Siberia. After arriving here, Stahmer began talks with Foreign Ministry advisor and former ambassador to Italy, Shiratori, and others on September 8. By the 16th, the negotiations had reached a concrete stage and a cabinet meeting was convened for seven and a half hours. Afterwards, Prime Minister Konoe and Planning Board President Hoshino immediately went to the Imperial Palace to report to the Emperor. In the Imperial Conference held on September 19, the decision to approve this pact was endorsed. The cabinet meeting on September 26, lasting twelve hours, discussed this pact, and after eight and a half hours of deliberation, the highest advisory body approved this pact. Later, in the Privy Council held before the Emperor, the proposal to approve this convention was unanimously passed. The council urged the government to take all necessary military and diplomatic means to cope with the international situation. (Reuters, 28th)

Tokyo: Stahmer, who Japanese newspapers called the "Masked Envoy," has now been officially identified by Japanese newspapers as the person responsible for bringing Japan into the Axis. The German ambassador to Japan, Major General Ott, recommended Stahmer, saying that he was "Ribbentrop's representative." Ott also said, "Stahmer has contributed greatly to the establishment of this alliance agreement." Although Stahmer's arrival in Japan was known, reports about his activities in Japan were prohibited from being published. Therefore, until last night, the Japanese newspapers called him the "Masked Envoy." The Japanese press is somewhat dissatisfied with Stahmer's attitude, because he often refused to announce news during talks, only expressing joy at the accomplishment of facts, refusing to comment on the agreement, and unwilling to reveal his activities in Japan. (Associated Press, 28th)

Japanese Foreign Minister Considers the Tripartite Alliance a Step that Risks the Nation's Fate

Tokyo: Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka Yosuke issued a statement last night, mentioning the conclusion of the treaty between Germany, Italy, and Japan, declaring, "Japan has taken steps to wager the fate of the entire nation at a time when it is encountering difficulties. The Japanese government believes that it has done its best to overcome all difficulties. Japan's foreign policy is to resolve the China issue, create a new order in Greater East Asia, and enhance world peace. However, certain countries do not understand this purpose very well. They have a mistaken idea that peace is to maintain the old order, and therefore obstruct Japan's work in various ways. Although the Japanese government has tried its best to clarify the situation to these countries and improve relations, the results have not only made no progress, but have even tended to worsen. In this environment, Japan cannot but unite internally and ally with Germany and Italy externally to realize its common political ideals. The German Foreign Minister has long had the desire to promote German-Japanese understanding, and the Italian Foreign Minister once served in the Far East and has a deep understanding of Japan's position. Both have contributed greatly to the conclusion of this pact. After the signing of the treaty, Germany, Italy, and Japan will cooperate with each other to establish a new order in Europe and the Far East. The establishment of this pact does not mean that Japan will immediately join the war, nor does Japan want to threaten any country. The relationship between the three countries and the Soviet Union will not be affected in any way according to the provisions of the pact. In the future, Japan's responsibility for establishing a new order in Greater Asia will be greater than in the past. Although Japan is willing to seriously realize this work, situations that require immediate decisions will inevitably occur. The Japanese government and people are prepared to face all consequences," he said. (Haitong News Agency, 28th)

Tokyo: This morning, all the newspapers published editorials, saying that Japan was forced into an alliance with Germany and Italy by the attitude and actions of the United States. However, most of them believe that the alliance is not military in nature. The Nichinichi Shimbun predicts that the three strong countries will fight for a long time for the new order, because the United States will continue to strive to maintain the status quo, even after Britain fails. The Asahi Shimbun said that the special clauses regarding the Soviet Union are not only due to the German-Soviet non-aggression pact, but also because the Japanese-Soviet relationship is very important in the new Asian order. From this point of view, Japan, Germany, and Italy all recognize the Soviet Union as an emerging strong country that can cooperate in building a new world order. This special clause also has important significance for Japan's future diplomacy towards the Soviet Union. The newspaper continued that the economic community expects the United States to increase pressure on Japan, but they are now planning to shift to the south and tighten economic controls on one side, thereby offsetting the adverse effects of the United States. Although this agreement is a kind of military alliance, it does not contain the intention of Japan participating in the European war. However, our responsibility to deal with the current situation in the world will indeed increase as a result. The public is superficially quiet about this move. Only a few buildings in the commercial district have flags of Italy, Germany, and Japan hanging. It is expected that there will be a large mass gathering in the near future to show support for this new alliance. (Reuters, 28th)

Tokyo: Regarding the questions raised by American journalists about whether the German-Italian-Japanese Tripartite Pact is directed at the Soviet Union, the Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman replied yesterday with regard to Articles 3 and 5 of the Pact, saying that Articles 3 and 5 are sufficient to explain this issue. The spokesman then solemnly pointed out that the signing of the Tripartite Pact cannot be regarded as changing Japan's policy of non-interference, at least for the time being. In short, no one can predict future developments. (Haitong News Agency, 28th)

No Excitement Seen in Tokyo

When the announcement of the alliance agreement signed in Berlin reached Tokyo, the city did not appear excited because theaters and restaurants have been closing early and most citizens had returned home. The atmosphere in the Foreign Ministry was extremely tense. The German and Italian embassies in Tokyo were both more cheerful than they had been in months. The embassies of neutral countries had lights on all night, as diplomatic personnel were rushing to prepare reports on the contents of the alliance agreement announced here and telegraph them to their governments. It was declared here last night that the Japanese Emperor had issued an edict authorizing this new alliance to "establish peace as soon as possible." The edict stated, "In order to restore peace, Japan has decided to join hands with Germany and Italy, who share the same ideals. The purpose of this agreement is to enable all countries in the world to obtain what they deserve. In order to overcome the current national crisis, we hope that the whole country will cooperate even more."

Konoe Issues a Message to the Japanese People

In a message to the nation last night, Japanese Prime Minister Konoe said that this new alliance will promote peace. He said, "Germany, Italy, and Japan share common interests. The time for Japan to rebuild Greater East Asia has arrived." The German and Italian ambassadors stationed in Tokyo visited the Foreign Ministry last night after the announcement of the signing of the new alliance. All diplomatic officials "exchanged congratulations. Afterwards, the ambassadors of the two Axis countries went to Konoe's private residence to pay a visit." (Associated Press, 18th)

As for the content of the talks between the Soviet Foreign Minister and the US Ambassador, it was not disclosed. Steinhardt had recently returned to the country to report to President Roosevelt on the state of Soviet-American relations, and returned to Moscow at the beginning of this month. Observers pointed out last night that Soviet-American trade has increased in recent months, and that Soviet gold exports to the United States last month were among the largest of any country. It is believed here that the US relationship with the Soviet Union is the best it has been since the establishment of the communist regime in Russia. (Associated Press, 28th)

### Japan Eagerly Seeks Closer Ties with the Soviet Union

Tokyo: Since signing the pact with Germany and Italy, Japan's official attention today seems to have shifted to approaching the Soviet Union. Japanese officials seem quite willing to conclude an agreement with the Soviet Union of the same nature as the German-Soviet agreement. However, the world is still unaware of the Soviet Union's attitude toward this plan. The Asahi Shimbun published a special commentary this morning, saying that the newly established tripartite agreement may promote closer ties between Japan and the Soviet Union. Japan, Germany, and Italy all recognize the Soviet Union as an emerging country that can cooperate in building a new order. The newspaper also mentioned the clause in the tripartite treaty that retains the clauses of each signatory country regarding relations with the Soviet Union, saying that this special clause is very important for Japan's future diplomatic policy toward the Soviet Union. (Associated Press, 28th)

### Japan Appealed to Britain for Cooperation; Shigemitsu Mamoru Remains Silent on the Tripartite Agreement

London: Reliable Japanese sources here recently stated that Japanese Ambassador to Britain Shigemitsu Mamoru visited British Foreign Office Undersecretary Butler on Wednesday to make a final appeal to Britain, demanding that Britain cooperate with Japan and criticizing Britain for obstructing Japan's legitimate actions in Asia over the past decade. The Japanese ambassador also asked Britain to immediately reconsider its policy on Japan's actions in East Asia, and assured Britain that Japan had no intention of invading British territories. At that time, Undersecretary Butler calmly asked him to tell him about the news of the German-Italian-Japanese alliance. Shigemitsu reported that he could not confirm and did not know the opinions of the people. (Associated Press, 28th)

### Japanese Troops Continue to Land in Haiphong; Chinese Troops Also Prepare to Enter; Japan Obtains Control of Base; French Officers Detained and Vietnamese Soldiers Disarmed

Chongqing: According to sources here, the Chinese troops along the Vietnamese border are still within Chinese territory, but it is believed that they will enter Vietnam at the appropriate time. They are now waiting for the situation to clarify. (Reuters, 28th)

Hanoi: After occupying the coastal forts in many provinces (transliteration) yesterday, the Japanese troops have obtained control of Annam's main naval base. This fort is the fortress of the Haiphong estuary. The Japanese troops detained two French officers stationed there and disarmed the Annamese soldiers guarding them. French officials believe that the Japanese occupation of the fort is a "minor accident" and does not seem to have any major repercussions. (Associated Press, 28th)

Hanoi: Japanese troops continued to land in Haiphong yesterday. Large numbers of Japanese planes flew in for reconnaissance every few hours. The first batch of Japanese troops to land were granted leave yesterday, so there were many Japanese troops coming and going on the streets of Haiphong. However, no accidents have occurred with the French and the natives. The Japanese military headquarters in Haiphong is located in the office of the Southwest Transportation Company. Before the Annam border was sealed off, the company was the only commercial agency specializing in shipping truck cars imported from the United States to China. When the Japanese troops landed in Haiphong, there were hundreds of truck cars waiting to be shipped to China. Since the Japanese army has occupied the company, it may also seize all the truck cars. (Associated Press, 28th)

France Claims Agreement Has Been Implemented

Vichy: At 5 p.m. yesterday, it was announced here that the French-Japanese conflict in Dong Dang and Qianqian in Vietnam had ended. Foreign Minister Baudouin said at a cabinet meeting that the war in Vietnam had stopped. Afterwards, an official statement stated that the French-Japanese agreement signed in Hanoi last Sunday is currently being implemented "in the friendly spirit of signing a treaty." This declaration is contrary to the news from Vietnam, which said that the Japanese troops in South China are about to withdraw from Vietnam. Some news said that the Japanese troops are continuing to advance towards Hanoi, and French officials in Vietnam have sent a request to Tokyo to stop the advance of the Japanese troops. According to informed sources here, if the Japanese troops retreat into China, Hanoi may reopen negotiations on a new agreement, allowing these Japanese troops to enter Vietnam under appropriate circumstances. Officials here refused to comment on the news that Colonel Jecko Bee, the representative of the Hanoi government sent to Washington, had obtained a guarantee of material assistance from the United States to resist further Japanese aggression.

Vichy: The cabinet held a state meeting today, chaired by Marshal Pétain. Foreign Minister Baudouin immediately submitted a report on the Vietnam issue, stating, "Although an accident occurred during the implementation of the agreement established between France and Japan on the Vietnam issue, it has now calmed down. Both parties are currently implementing this agreement in the friendly and faithful spirit of its establishment. (Havas News Agency, 27th)

Hanoi: Regarding the issue of French Indochina, officials announced that the military agreement established between France and Japan on the 22nd of this month is now being implemented in a normal state. Japanese troops are continuing to land in Haiphong in accordance with the provisions of this agreement. As for Liangshan, there is nothing to report. As of now, the overall situation has gradually returned to normal. The military and political authorities have also ordered the lights in various places to gradually return to normal. (Havas News Agency, 27th)

US Willing to Assist if Vietnam Resists

San Francisco: Jerko Bee, a member of the special envoy group representing French Annam to the United States, declared here yesterday that he had obtained a guarantee from Washington that if Japan further invades Annam, the United States would provide assistance in main materials to resist. He believes that the United States' promise to assist Annam will also have a profound impact on future events in the Far East. Jerko Bee said, "The people of Annam, behind our army, have firmly united and are prepared to resist all attempts to change our political or military status quo." It is heard that Martin, the commander of the French army in Annam, has prepared everything to accept material assistance from the United States. Jerko Bee's declaration is considered extremely important here, because there have also been reports recently that if Annam can maintain its status as an independent French entity, the US government can supply Annam with arms. It is also heard that if Annam is likely to be punished by the Vichy government or fall into the hands of the Germans, the United States would obviously not be willing to help with arms. A few days ago, Jerko Bee said in Washington that Annam was prepared to spend a huge sum of 1,200,000 US dollars to purchase aircraft, anti-aircraft guns, and machine guns. (Associated Press, 28th)

Thailand's Attitude Also Becoming Stronger

Bangkok: The Thai government announced that it has ordered a part of the infantry reserves to enlist on October 31, and a part of the naval reserves to enlist on October 15. It is learned that this measure is related to France's refusal to revise its territorial demands. It is claimed that the Bangkok government has received countless petitions from all walks of life in the country, all demanding that the government realize its demands on France by force. The government is pleased with the petitions, but strives to order the people to remain calm. If the possibility of a peaceful understanding between France and Thailand exists for one day, the people should wait for negotiations to resolve the issue. What must be made clear is that the Thai government, in any case, insists on the revision of the border. (Haitong News Agency, 28th)

Chongqing: Ye Jianying, chief of staff of the Eighth Route Army, recently accused Japan of attempting to force Thailand to act as a vanguard to attack the Malayan Federation and create a Pacific war. Ye also said that after Japan occupies Vietnam, it will carry out a political offensive against Thailand to promote Thailand's attack on Malaya. He also said that due to the geographical situation, it is probably impossible for the Japanese to attack Yunnan from Vietnam. (Associated Press, 28th)

### Dragon Cloud's Departure from Yunnan: Absolutely Groundless

Chongqing: A reporter, noting the recent contradictory information from Japanese propaganda outlets, visited authoritative sources with access to reliable information to inquire about their views on this matter. According to them, Japan believed that by attacking Vietnam, they could incite estrangement between the southwestern generals and the central government. Thus, on the 18th and 19th of this month, they fabricated stories of Chairman Long being forcibly brought to Chongqing by the central government. However, the truth speaks for itself, as Chairman Long remains firmly stationed on the frontier. Furthermore, on the 22nd of this month, they released news claiming that Chairman Long, in Kunming, made statements to Hong Kong Chinese reporters. This contradicts the previous reports of Chairman Long being forced to Chongqing, and thus disproves itself. They also fabricated stories of President Kong and President Yu leaving Chongqing to go abroad. In reality, President Kong recently presided over a National Saving Movement for National Reconstruction in Chongqing, which was very enthusiastic. President Yu has also been attending various meetings and making speeches recently. They also claimed that the Communist Party made various demands to the government and that the government planned to relocate the capital. All of these are absolutely groundless. (28th Dispatch)

### After the U.S. Loaned China a Huge Sum, the Chongqing Market Became Active, the Credit of Legal Tender Increased, and Prices of Daily Necessities Fell

Chongqing: After the United States granted China another loan, it has made a profound impression on all sectors in the wartime capital. People are heartened, and the financial market has suddenly become active. The credit of the legal tender has increased, and there are many sellers in the market, a rare sight. Items previously rarely seen have gradually appeared on the market, and the prices of daily necessities have generally fallen. In the past two days, reporters have interviewed several people from all walks of life. Their deep attention to and optimism about the current international situation are unprecedented. Observers said that the political significance of the American loan to China today far outweighs the economic significance. After three years of resistance, the greatness of the Chinese nation and its arduous struggle for world peace have gradually been understood by friendly nations. The American loan and the complete embargo on steel are a reflection of this understanding. As for the German-Italian-Japanese alliance, it has long existed as a fact and has no impact on China's resistance, being regarded only as an international dynamic. (28th Dispatch)

### German Planes Attack England Day and Night, Still Centered on the London Area, Indiscriminate Bombing Causes Extensive Damage, British Claim to Have Destroyed 130 German Planes

Berlin: German planes continued to attack London this morning, seeing that the fires in various places had not yet been extinguished. In the past 36 hours, German planes have dropped over one million kilograms of various types of bombs on southern and central England. (28th Huitong Dispatch)

London: This morning, a squadron of German bombers and British fighters engaged in a fierce aerial battle southeast of London, lasting for one hour. When the German planes crossed the Kent coast, they were flying very high. Land-based anti-aircraft batteries opened fire, bombarding them fiercely. Heavy artillery fire was heard several times in central London, and an alarm was issued, but no planes were seen. According to a bulletin from the Ministry of Aviation, a total of 133 German planes were shot down yesterday. Several waves of air raids last night were still centered on London, and bombs fell in many places. Incendiary bombs caused fires, but they were quickly extinguished. There were slight casualties among residents. Several houses in the Mouset area were damaged, with few casualties. Although some bombs fell in other parts of the Lanca County, there was little damage. Several towns in the Midlands were bombed, but casualties were relatively light. Several areas between London and the south coast were also bombed by German planes, resulting in only a few houses being destroyed and few civilian casualties. In the evening, some bombs fell in eastern Scotland, but there were no reports of damage or casualties. (28th Reuters Dispatch)

London: Since the 1st of this month, including the German planes shot down during yesterday's air raid, more than 1,000 German planes have been destroyed by attacks on England. According to a bulletin from the Ministry of Aviation, this is the second consecutive month in which the British have destroyed more than 1,000 German planes. After the German air force launched three large-scale attacks on England in three weeks, all of which ended in defeat, German planes approached London again last night and were subjected to intense anti-aircraft fire. Batteries in the suburbs fired shells as densely as rain, and the ground shook as the German bombs exploded. However, the intensity of the fire forced the German planes to at least temporarily divert their course. Most enemy planes were forced to fly very high, and then anti-aircraft batteries in central London also roared in unison. Three bombs fell in quick succession in the central area, and the fires caused by the incendiary bombs were quickly extinguished. Two cities in the Midlands and a city on the northeast coast were also attacked.

Yesterday, large formations of German bombers, protected by an even larger number of fighters, repeatedly attempted to penetrate London's defenses. However, London's defense work proceeded smoothly with little obstruction. According to a bulletin from the Ministry of Aviation, it is now known that a total of 130 enemy planes were destroyed yesterday. Thirty-four British fighters are missing, but 15 pilots are safe. Yesterday's intense anti-aircraft fire in London was unprecedented. According to Reuters air force correspondents observing the battle in the southeastern suburbs of London, British planes intercepted fiercely. Anti-aircraft shells exploded over the Thames Estuary, and black smoke filled the sky at an altitude of 25,000 feet. Before long, eight large German bombers fled in disarray. These eight were perhaps the remnants of a large formation of German planes. Allied planes and German fighters fought fiercely over the bombers. This scene was frequently seen over the southern suburbs of London and the towns facing the English Channel. Enemy planes attempted to find a way to penetrate London, but failed and hastily dropped their bombs and fled.

The Ministry of Aviation's intelligence department stated that the German air force launched its largest attack on Britain in two weeks yesterday, and its loss of pilots was the highest since the 15th of this month. Yesterday, the British air force destroyed 128 enemy planes, and anti-aircraft guns shot down two. The attacking enemy planes were divided into four groups. Three of them flew directly to London and southeastern England, and the fourth flew to Bristol. The first group of 180 planes crossed the coast near Dunas in Kent at 8:45 yesterday morning. Only 30 of them infiltrated London, all of which were Messerschmitts. Only a few circled overhead carrying ammunition, waiting for Dornier and Heinkel heavy bombers, but the bombers did not arrive. The Messerschmitt German planes were then severely attacked, and British patrols shot down four enemy planes, severely damaged many more, and pursued the remnants of the enemy planes to a point ten miles outside the English Channel. (28th Reuters Dispatch)

### German Military Communique

German planes attacked a convoy north of Ireland, sinking one merchant ship (5,000 tons). Several British planes raided the western border of Germany at night, indiscriminately bombing without causing any damage. German planes concentrated on bombing London and Liverpool last night. In yesterday's aerial battles, 101 British planes were shot down, and 38 German planes are missing. A German minesweeper attacked a British submarine with depth charges, and it is believed to have sunk. (28th Huitong Dispatch)

### British Planes Fly to Germany for Days, Conducting Large-Scale Air Raids, Three German Warships Hit in the Kiel Canal

According to responsible sources, in the week ending September 26th, British air forces attacked German territory or occupied areas day and night. Notable targets include (1) the Kiel Canal, where the German warship "Scharnhorst" was damaged by bombs that fell nearby, and two other warships were directly hit, (2) the Templehof Airfield in Berlin, (3) the Lauta aluminum plant, 100 miles southeast of Berlin, (4) the Siemens and Halske electrical equipment factory.

### Free French Forces Join British Forces to Attack Dakar, Admit That It Has Failed, Several British Warships Were Damaged

London: Although the Dakar affair has failed, we acknowledge that. However, there is no reason to place too much importance on this situation. The British government now believes that this matter has come to an end. The reason for this failure of the Free French Forces was the inaccuracy of the view of Dakar people being supporters of General Troglo. French warships departing from the Mediterranean suddenly arrived at Dakar. During the engagement, several British warships were hit by artillery fire, but the damage was not serious. Rumors that General Troglo is currently en route to Vietnam are untrue. His whereabouts are currently unknown. (2-

### Gandhi Meets with the Indian Viceroy for a Long Talk of Three and a Half Hours

Simla: Gandhi met with the Indian Viceroy for three and a half hours yesterday and stayed overnight here. Gandhi decided to stay here until Sunday or Monday. This development has created a more hopeful atmosphere than before.

### Germany and Italy Persuade Spain to Join the Military Alliance, to Utilize Spain's Strategic Bases to Seriously Threaten Britain and the United States

Berlin: According to usually reliable sources here, Nationalist Spain will join the new military and economic alliance signed here by Germany, Italy, and Japan. Spanish Interior Minister Serrano Suñer met with Italian Foreign Minister Ciano here yesterday for two hours. It was subsequently reported that Foreign Minister Ciano would stay in Berlin for several more days and would not return to Rome immediately. Before the meeting between the Italian Foreign Minister and the Spanish Interior Minister, Spanish officials and several senior German officials (including Hitler and German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop) had held detailed discussions here this week. Diplomatic circles firmly believe that when the new military and economic alliance treaty is established here, Spain will definitely be one of the signatory countries. It is pointed out here that Nationalist Spain has "very significant effects." Spain will recover its small territories in South America, receive economic assistance from the Axis powers, and may recover Gibraltar. Spain can provide the following benefits to the Allied countries: (1) Allow the Axis powers to use Spain's naval and air bases with military value, so as to tighten the blockade against Britain and break its blockade against Germany and Italy. (2) Control Gibraltar to threaten the British Mediterranean fleet. (3) Facilitate transportation to Dakar, as it is widely believed that the Axis powers will use this point to invade the Western Hemisphere in the future. (4) Incite the Spanish-speaking countries in South America to divert the United States' attention to the Far East. German newspapers today all publish the news of this new military and economic alliance on the entire front page, speeding up the "collapse" of the British Empire. (28th United Press Dispatch)

### Turkey Seeks to Promote Relations with the Soviet Union

It is said that the reaction of Germany, Italy, and Japan to the Turkey pact may cause Turkey to seek to promote relations with the Soviet Union. People here generally believe that the wording of the pact is clearly a warning to the United States and weakens Britain's position. It is widely believed that in view of the evolution of the international situation, in order to enhance its own position, Turkey has decided to strive to promote relations with the Soviet Union. Some say that Moscow will accept Turkey's movements. (28th Huitong Dispatch)

Istanbul: Communist propaganda in various Balkan countries has recently undergone a significant change. Leaflets printed under the direction of Moscow, which have always been anti-British in nature, now only have an anti-Axis tendency. A leaflet distributed in Bulgaria warned of the increasing number of so-called German "tourists" in the country. It is said that these Germans are either the Fifth Column, preparing to turn Bulgaria into a base for German imperialism." Knowledgeable observers believe that the Soviet Union's recent actions in the Balkans indicate that its current policy is to secretly reduce the influence of the Axis powers to the extent possible, while maintaining amicable relations with Germany on the surface to avoid possible accidents.

American Pacific Fleet and Air Force

### America's Pacific Policy

— Original author John Gunther, published in the American Foreign Affairs Quarterly

Secondly, if Japan and the United States go to war, the Philippine Islands will inevitably become Japan's first target. The ability of the United States to defend these islands has sparked heated debate among many experts. The majority opinion is that the Philippines cannot withstand continuous or large-scale Japanese attacks. To make the Philippines impregnable, it would cost at least $1 billion, but under the current circumstances, the U.S. Congress is unlikely to approve it.

The position of the United States in China and the Philippines is quite vulnerable. If the United States and Japan go to war, everyone can see that the center of gravity will be the defense line in the central Pacific. This defense line is the U.S. Navy.

According to the statistics of January 1, 1940, the naval strength comparison between the United States and Japan is as follows:

Among these many ships, on the American side, there is one battleship, two light cruisers, one hundred and fifteen destroyers, and thirty-two submarines that have exceeded their service life and are close to being abandoned. On the Japanese side, there is also one battleship, five heavy cruisers, eight light cruisers, thirty-six destroyers, and nineteen submarines that have exceeded their service life.

Since January 1, 1940, the U.S. warships under construction include eight new battleships (300,000 tons), two aircraft carriers (34,700 tons), six light cruisers (44,000 tons), one giant minelayer, thirty-one destroyers (49,980 tons), and fifteen submarines (20,820 tons). The details of Japan's shipbuilding are kept strictly secret and are unknown. However, as far as is known, the ships that have been built and are planned to be built include four battleships, two aircraft carriers, five light cruisers, nine destroyers, and three submarines. Among them, the average weight of the newly built battleships is about 40,000 tons. U.S. naval experts believe that the size of Japan's new battleships will not only be greatly increased, but there are four or even eight that have already been launched. Among the new U.S. battleships, there are six of 35,000 tons and two of 45,000 tons. These battleships are larger than any existing battleships, and they are also faster and have stronger combat power. According to a report in the New York Times, the naval commander, Stark, said that the two battleships built in 1941 may reach 52,000 tons or even 55,000 tons. The tonnage of U.S. battleships is limited by the 110-foot width of the Panama Canal lock, so it can only be built to this maximum height.

Japan's mandated islands, formerly belonging to Germany, occupy a vast area in the southwestern Pacific, including the Palau Islands, the Mariana Islands, the Caroline Islands, and the Marshall Islands, which include a total of 1,400 islands. But the total area is only 829 square miles, most of which are worthless coral islands, and few have military value. The only place with a good port and fortifications is Truk Island, and another possible or existing base is Saipan Island, north of Guam. In 1939, Japan opened an air route from Yokohama to the island, and from there to the Palau Islands. Japan has strictly prohibited foreigners from traveling to these islands for several years; therefore, few people know the truth.

The United States is also building bases in the Pacific. After these bases are completed, the U.S. defense line in the Pacific will become an irregular triangle, from Alaska to Hawaii, and from Hawaii to the Panama Canal.

Complementing this triangle are other bases, such as Midway Island and Wake Island, which are sufficient to form a vanguard to defend Hawaii. As for the islands south of Hawaii, such as Johnston, Palmyra, and Canton, they can also become a barrier between Hawaii and the Panama Canal Zone. Further south is the American island of Samoa, which has not yet been designated as a base, but can be transformed into one.

First, let's talk about Alaska and the Aleutian region. The base in this region guards the key route of the great circle between Japan and the United States, which is the shortest route across the Pacific. The naval authorities have spent $8,570,000 as operating expenses for the island. The Army Department plans to allocate $12,734,000 to improve the base there, but it has been rejected by the House of Representatives.

Moving south from Alaska, we arrive at Hawaii. Here, on Oahu, the United States has turned Pearl Harbor into the Gibraltar of the Pacific, at a cost of at least $700 million. It is the second most important military point in the United States after the Panama Canal. Pearl Harbor has a submarine base, dry docks, fuel and ammunition depots, and a large-scale naval station. It is large enough to accommodate the entire U.S. fleet, and it also has a naval airfield with enough food to last for fifty days. There are also many airfields built nearby.

Finally, let's talk about the Panama Canal. Most American experts believe that the Panama Canal can avoid attacks from the Pacific due to the long distance. Japan is nearly 800 miles away from the Panama Canal. Any Japanese aircraft carrier that attempts to bomb the Panama Canal will encounter full defense, so Japan's adventure will not become a problem.

Let's talk about the issue of defending Guam. Guam is located outside the 180th meridian, with an area of 250 square miles and a population of 21,000 Chamorro natives, far outside the inner circle of American Pacific interests. It is 3,300 miles west of Honolulu, 1,500 miles east of Manila, and 1,350 miles from Yokohama. Therefore, Guam is closer to Japan than to the United States. Apart from the Philippines, Guam can be said to be the westernmost territory of the United States. However, Guam is surrounded by shoals of islands under Japanese mandate. Japan's base on Saipan Island is only 100 miles away from Guam.

Many American naval experts advocate turning Guam into the "Gibraltar of the Pacific," making it a submarine and air base. Moderates only ask to spend $5 million to deepen Apra Harbor and build breakwaters and ramps for seaplanes. Guam is currently only an important link in the Pacific air route.

### Food Prices: Rice Prices Cause Great Commotion; Imported Rice Fluctuates by Two to Three Dollars; No. 1 Saigon Sells for Seventy-Three Dollars; Top-Grade White Rice Actually Opens at Ninety Dollars

Since the imported rice market tightened again the other day, yesterday it was even more agitated by the Vietnam issue, rumors of shipping disruptions, which fueled rising sentiment. Those with goods hoarded them, considering them rare commodities, and those wanting to buy rushed to do so. For a time, speculation and actual sales went hand in hand, and sellers' calls flew. In a moment in the early morning, each price had risen by one dollar. Afterwards, they continued to rise, and by the end of the session, the result was a noted increase of two dollars. No. 1 Saigon was seventy-three dollars, Fire Cracker seventy-two dollars, No. 2 Saigon sixty-eight dollars, No. 3 Siam sixty-seven dollars, Small Pattern sixty-six and a half, sixty-six dollars. The original packaged Yinghua Company rice was even more active in speculation, with No. 2 Saigon at seventy-nine and a half dollars, seventy-nine dollars and eight cents, reaching as high as eighty dollars. No. 2 Siam was seventy-nine dollars, and there were even calls for eighty dollars. Small Cracker was seventy-eight dollars, also soaring two or three dollars compared to the previous day. However, at noon, Shenji Foreign Company and Jianyuan Company suddenly announced four or five thousand tons of telegrams, and the market immediately turned flat. At noon, it was rumored in the market that the order had been reinstated at eighty dollars, and one said it had not yet been reinstated, but it was possible to be reinstated on Monday. People's hearts immediately became empty, and rice prices fell sharply by one or two dollars in the afternoon.

As the supply of thick and thin varieties of rice continued to be cut off, and as imported rice soared, its momentum became more and more popular, as if it were about to soar to the sky. It was heard that Kaichang's high-grade rice had actually reached the ninety-dollar mark, and the next best, Susu rice, also required eighty-five or sixty dollars. Other Nangang fresh, original-packaged early rice also sold for a record high price of ninety dollars, 86.7 to 85 dollars per bushel, a huge jump of two or three dollars compared to before.

Although the supply of new rice tips was continuous, it was not as strong as the previous week, with only over a thousand packages. However, the sales floor took advantage of this good news and sold out in an instant. The price rose by two or three dollars along with the broken rice. Zhuanqiao new rice opened at seventy-nine dollars, Jiading Taicang new rice tips at sixty-nine dollars, and Qingjiao Du tips at seventy dollars and five cents.

Glutinous rice alone, due to its narrow outlet, both domestic and imported goods remained at their original levels, without gains or losses. Jinli special yuan sold for seventy-two dollars, Changdan seventy-one dollars, seventy-one dollars, similar to Hong Kong yuan.

### Flour Market Firm and Steady; Wheat Sales Dull

Flour: Yesterday was the end of the week, and apart from scattered retail sales on this street, customers and hoarders had no activity. This was because trading in futures of Japanese Phoenix Brand flour had ceased, and the number of factory warehouse receipts for returned goods was limited. Moreover, at the end of the month, various factories collected warehouse rent, so new buyers felt particularly lacking. However, with the price of rice being expensive and the production of current flour being insufficient, sentiment was considered firm and steady. The price of No. 2 factory was sixteen dollars and five cents, and returned goods still had to be raised by one dollar. Although there was a large amount of imported flour traded, the inventory of spot goods was not large. Yesterday, this street purchased 500 packages of Fortress Brand flour, which still required eighteen dollars and two cents. The whole market of Chinese factories sold a total of more than six thousand packages, but various stores still had no goods to meet the market demand.

Wheat: Yesterday, the market continued to be dull. Because the supply of sources from inland Jinghu Line area was still small, the appetite of Japanese and Chinese factories was flat, and it was not easy for the market to rise. In the end, it hovered at the original price. There was little activity in the overall market. Apart from Chinese factories receiving one or two hundred packages, Japanese factories only received two or three thousand packages. The selling price was still around twenty-four and a half dollars and twenty-one dollars.

### Finance: Divergence in British and American Exchange Rates

The foreign exchange market yesterday, HSBC's listed prices, remained unchanged. The black market for British and American exchange rates fluctuated on the weekend, with the underlying trend initially tight and then loosening, resulting in a mixed phenomenon. The British soft was .015625, which was three shillings fourpence eight four three seven five. The American hard was .03125, which was five yuan four zero six two five. The American exchange rate was soft because various Chinese and foreign banks intended to sell, and it was heard that speculators had opened short positions. Also, a certain Jewish merchant was returning to his country and released the US dollars in his hand. The tightness of the British exchange rate was due to the continued support of Hong Kong Telecom.

Hong Kong Banks Continue to Advance Orders

Early in the morning, London's major items, near and far, were still flat. The New York silver price and the London gold price were both reported to be fixed. The exchange rates of British to American and American to Shanghai were all flat. The American to British fell by two and a half cents, and to Shanghai by a small three cents. The central bank's listed prices for various exchanges, such as sales, the banks opened with spot selling prices in the morning, British gold at three shillings fourpence eight four three seven five, and American exchange at five yuan three four three seven five. Compared to the previous close, the British was tight .015625, and the American soft .03125. After the opening, Chinese banks and Japanese banks all intended to sell, and the market was stable. It was calculated that the spot US dollars were sold to foreign banks such as Yuli at five yuan three seven five. At the same time, foreign banks also had matching transactions. HSBC's listed prices were announced without changes, and the silver equalization tax was also announced without increases or decreases. Afterwards, overseas Chinese sold to Hong Kong Telecom British gold for October at three shillings fourpence eight four three seven five, and shortly after it was heard that Jewish merchants also sold spot US dollars to foreign banks at five yuan four zero six two five, and the situation turned hard. At noon, Yuli bought October futures of American exchange from a certain bank at five yuan four zero six two five. Until the close of the market, British gold was three shillings fourpence eight four three two seven five, American exchange was five yuan four zero six two five, October British gold was three shillings fourpence six eight seven five, American exchange was five yuan three seven five. As a result, the British was tight .015625, and the American hard .0325. There was no market on Saturday afternoon.

Hong Kong American Exchange Loosens

At 11:30 AM, the British was flat and the American loosened. American exchange, spot, continued to be hard .0635, was twenty-three yuan two five.

The black market for "Lianchao" was unchanged, still opening at eighty-eight yuan and seven and a half cents.

### Financial Commentary – September 28th –

— Sheng Kai

In mid-September, news from Hong Kong claimed that a large loan between China and the United States had been established. At that time, not only did the United States not admit it, nor did they acknowledge it, but also the Chinese economic envoy, Mr. Song Ziwen, remained silent. However, despite the fact that it could not be confirmed at the time, it attracted the attention of Chinese and foreign people, and the Japanese felt as if they were sitting on pins and needles. Now, on the eve of the Japanese army's invasion of Vietnam, when the crisis in the Pacific was about to reach its climax, the United States announced the formal establishment of the new Sino-US loan.

According to the official document of the United States: The US government lent 25 million US dollars to China to maintain China's foreign exchange needs. According to Mr. Jones, Chairman of the Economic Revival Committee, the new loan to China will be handled by the Export-Import Bank, which is semi-official in nature, and will be directly loaned to the Chinese government, guaranteed by the Central Bank, and the debt will be offset by the price of tungsten sold to the United States. The United States has decided to purchase tungsten worth 30 million US dollars from the China Resources Committee for the needs of US national defense. This loan to China by the US Export-Import Bank is the third time, with a total of 70 million US dollars lent to China.

Although this loan of 25 million US dollars is not as large as the amount rumored before, in the era when the lines between the aggressors and the anti-aggressors are clearly defined in the international situation, when Japan is taking advantage of the situation to realize its southward policy, the United States suddenly continues to lend to China. As far as the United States itself is concerned, it shows that the United States is concerned about the Far East, and the status quo in the Far East does not allow arbitrary changes by the aggressors. Now Japan's invasion of Vietnam is not only a powerful blow to Burma, Singapore, the Dutch East Indies, and the Philippines, but also a major threat to the United States in the Pacific. Therefore, the United States actively assists China in its war of resistance, so that Japan is restrained by the war against China, and is unable to act freely in the South Pacific. However, in the process of China's self-reliance in resisting aggression and building the country, what it expects from the United States is increasing. Since this loan is to repay debts with tungsten, China currently has no way to transport tungsten to the United States due to the closure of the Burma Road. Therefore, the United States should actively encourage Britain to open the Burma Road unconditionally on October 18, after only three months of closure. Not only can the United States itself obtain the materials needed for national defense from China, but China can also obtain the assistance of the United States in terms of military fire and other items, so as to enhance China's anti-aggression forces and restrain Japan's actions in the South Pacific.

The establishment of the new Sino-US loan, from a political point of view, has been described above. From a financial point of view, how will it affect China's anti-war economy? The author should also point out some things. According to the official document of the United States, it is to help China maintain its foreign exchange needs, so although the amount is small, the equivalent of British pounds is more than 6 million pounds, accounting for more than three-fifths of the amount of the British equalization fund in 1939, which is certainly better than the 5 million pounds of assistance provided by Britain at that time in maintaining the exchange rate of the Chinese legal tender. However, how the Chinese government will use this 25 million US dollars of foreign exchange funds depends on the facts in the future, but the author observes that it will not be outside the following two ways: one is to intensify the economic construction of free China, and the other is to stabilize the black market for the legal tender. There are two kinds of funds needed for the economic construction of the anti-war: one is the legal tender needed internally, and the other is the foreign exchange needed externally. The former is currently being vigorously promoted by Chairman Chiang himself, so the accumulation of surplus funds is not a problem. However, the development of mines, the establishment of light and heavy industries, the construction of water conservancy, and the development of transportation and other anti-war economic constructions, all require foreign exchange funds to purchase machinery, materials, and tools from abroad, so the collection of foreign exchange funds is a very important issue. Therefore, in order to promote the economic construction of the anti-war, China must invest this 25 million US dollars of loans in the purchase of machinery, materials, and tools. (To be continued)

### The Bullish Gold Market Turns Bearish

Yesterday's spot gold black market situation, after the heavy rise the previous day, suddenly fell back again. This was because the exchange market was loose and flat, and the market fluctuated unstably, which made people wary. On the contrary, those who sold short added to their positions when the price was high. Therefore, after opening at six thousand one hundred and twenty yuan today, although the banks bought it up, it rose again to a high price of six thousand one hundred and twelve yuan. However, after this, gold dealers and floating bulls sold each other, and at that time the exchange market turned hard, immediately falling to six thousand and ninety yuan. Later, it relied on the securities firms to pull it up by 20 yuan, but suddenly a certain bank came to sell short, and retail investors followed suit, adding to the sales. In addition, before the close, the bulls in the securities firms violently came out of the cage. It was heard that they had turned from bulls to bears, so it had fallen to six thousand and sixty-five yuan. Fortunately, the money exchange industry pulled it up at noon, so it closed at six thousand and seventy-five yuan, resulting in a drop of forty-five yuan compared to the previous day. The trading volume in half a day was about four thousand taels. The price of gold jewelry in silver shops was down by ten yuan, and the customs gold was flat.

Spot Gold Falls Forty-Five Yuan

The market started firmly in the morning, rising by ten yuan at the opening. Gold dealers sold to banks twenty taels, for six thousand one hundred and thirty yuan. Then, the exchange market was slightly tight, and a certain bank's appetite was still healthy, searching for three or four hundred taels, so it had been raised to six thousand one hundred and forty-two yuan. Soon, because the exchange market turned loose, gold dealers and banks competed to sell, immediately falling by dozens of yuan, with banks trading twenty taels with each other, retreating to six thousand and ninety yuan. After this, relying on the securities firms and retail investors to pull it up, although it rose back to six thousand one hundred and ten yuan, it fell again to six thousand and ninety yuan because the banks tended to sell short. At that time, gold dealers and retail investors also came to sell, and in addition, the securities firms massively came out of the cage before the close, falling miserably to six thousand and sixty-five yuan. However, the closing relied on a certain money exchange company's sudden buying intent, so the result was six thousand and seventy-five yuan, a drop of forty-five yuan compared to the previous day, fluctuating by seventy-seven yuan in half a day. The selling price of the main brand gold of the cash gold shops was more than ten yuan higher according to the spot gold price, and the purchase price was reduced by thirty yuan. The current bidding gold was more than fifty yuan lower than the listed gold, and there was little trading.

Jewelry Gold Down Ten Yuan

The exchange price of jewelry gold per tael was unchanged at first, but at noon, it was down by one yuan. It was calculated that Datongxing changed the suspension to six hundred and thirty yuan, and the new companies had similar prices to the previous prices. The purchase was reduced by about thirty yuan.

### Most Foreign Currencies Fall Slightly

Yesterday's foreign currency market, spot gold suddenly tended to fall again, and the British and American gold pounds also fell by one yuan unanimously. Although the demand for British gold notes was rare, the note holders were also unwilling to depress the price and sell. Therefore, the market price still remained at the original level. American gold notes initially rose to eighteen yuan and six cents because the three countries of Germany, Italy, and Japan had signed a military and economic alliance guarantee. Later, because the black market for American exchange loosened, the market price gradually fell, and finally it was eighteen yuan and three and a half cents, a drop of one cent and three points compared to the previous day. Hong Kong notes rose back by one cent. The supply and demand of Japanese gold notes were equal, and the market price was stable. The evening market was still one yuan and four cents and nine points. The demand for Korean notes was slightly higher, and the market price rose slightly, with the evening market rising to one yuan, one cent, and nine points.

### Securities: Domestic Debt Buyers Swarm

The securities black market, yesterday the market turned to rising again, the trend was quite unstable, especially in the afternoon. The return the other day was because people generally believed that the Sino-US loan was not income in cash, and it has now been proven that it is specially used to maintain foreign exchange loans, which proves the close relationship between China and the United States. The alliance between Germany, Italy, and Japan is nothing more than an old story, and it is not valued by all parties, which is enough to show its imposing appearance but weak inside. Therefore, the future of public debt has gradually entered the main road, and with the promotion of abundant floating funds, buying when the price is small has become a slogan for most people in the market. Occasional pressure from the inspection party is just to create opportunities for the multi-party. Yesterday afternoon, in the midst of the valiant buying by various parties, Type A broke through five yuan, Type B broke through eight yuan, Type C approached seven yuan, Type D also rushed out of the five yuan mark, and Type E also reached six yuan. Type D has exceeded the high price of September 10 and seen a new high price. Buyers are in eager need of No. 6, absorbing more than 300,000 in the morning and afternoon. Lianhe Xinfu, Tongsheng Hongda, Le Maohengkang, and Yitai all have considerable needs. The sellers Tongkang is mostly Renchang Yongkang Datong Lianyi and Hengfu are all selling out, and the market price has been rising in a straight line from morning to night, with a difference of more than one yuan between high and low. As a result, they all rose back six, seven cents to one yuan and one cent, and the total number of transactions was more than one and a half million yuan. A brief table is listed below.

Stock trading, one hundred shares of Zhabei Water and Electricity shares were traded, at a price of six yuan and nine cents. London external loans, etc., were unchanged.

### Baoan Insurance Pays Dividends

The British Baoan Insurance Co., Ltd. is scheduled to pay the interim dividend for this year on November 15, at twelve shillings and sixpence per share.

### Sugar Market: More Than a Thousand Packages of Green Sugar Open; Dutch Cotton White Falls Slightly by Half a Yuan

Yesterday's sugar market association's price, spot 24 coarse white July arrival seventy-nine yuan, new goods eighty yuan, transit goods sixty-three yuan, Dutch cotton white BS mark seventy-five yuan, down five cents, Dutch red sixty-one yuan and five cents, road goods sixty-one yuan, this factory's No. 1 ice one hundred and one yuan and five cents, Jingming ice one hundred and three yuan, winter mist green sixty-four yuan, bowl green sixty-two yuan, more than a thousand packages opened by Xinyi, Taikoo B mark spot seventy-six yuan and two cents, DY mark seventy-four yuan and three cents, HX mark seventy-four yuan and two cents to seventy-four yuan, H red sixty-one yuan, Taikoo Foreign Company opened October shipment B mark thirteen yuan and seven cents and five points, DY mark thirteen yuan and one cent and five points, HX mark thirteen yuan and zero five points, all calculated in Hong Kong dollars, totaling 10,000 packages traded.

### Yarn and Cotton: Speculation Concentrated; Yarn Market Is Easy to Rise and Difficult to Fall; Shuangma Returns to the 1,100 Yuan Mark

The yarn market continued to rise, but actual sales still maintained the market, so people's hearts were very good, and they were unanimously optimistic. The number of chips in the market was slightly dry, and buyers were more and more prosperous, so the market trend was rising. However, the overseas cotton market was still weak, and foreign exchange softened. Generally speaking, speculation in foreign exchange and gold has been tasteless recently, and everyone is inclined to attack Shuangma, so the yarn market has become easy to rise and difficult to fall.

Shuangma yarn opened in the morning with enthusiastic popularity. Everyone looked forward to rising, because the big players had good ideas, and the chips on the market were absorbed by them and closed down. The opening price was one thousand and ninety-five yuan. As soon as this price opened, buyers flocked in, and the momentum was sharp, immediately rising to one thousand one hundred and fifteen yuan. Soon after, it was heard that foreign exchange was lengthened and gold prices were depressed, and floating bulls released, falling to one thousand and ninety-seven yuan. Shortly before the close, it suddenly rose to one thousand one hundred and seven yuan, and then it traded to one thousand one hundred and twelve yuan. The statistics for half a day show that 4,055 packages were traded, and the price rose by 27 yuan. Today, there are 1,415 pieces of yarn being shipped to Hong Kong. The amount purchased by each helping mouth is listed below, divided as follows: 3,200 for fellow traders, 400 for Yunnan (statistics), 055 for Hong Kong, 615 for Ningbo, 10.

### Spot Transaction Volume Increases, Cotton Prices Look High

Although spot cotton trading has not seen a significant upswing, people's confidence is high due to the good yarn market, and they are also optimistic about cotton prices.

Another report indicates that overseas cotton market prices in the New York cotton market initially rose due to speculative buying in the early morning. However, later due to unfavorable European political news and selling by spot merchants, the closing price fell by 13-14 points compared to the previous day. Indian cotton, including forecasts, fell by 4 rupees.

In the Shanghai foreign cotton market, trading has become more active again recently. This is because foreign firms, due to the German-Japanese-Italian pact and the increase in terrorist incidents, require full payment for orders of foreign cotton. Therefore, various parties are unwilling to place orders, and those in the trade are turning to the spot market. Many spot transactions have occurred recently, and it is predicted that the spot market will become even more active in the future.

### Miscellaneous: Candles, Soap, Matches - All Prices Rising

The match market is tight, and it is rumored that taxes will also increase. There is also talk of pricing based on the daily gold price of the joint venture. Factories are dispatching limited quantities, and traders are increasing their reserves, searching the market for supplies. As a result, the market situation is tightening. Yesterday, "Beautiful" brand sold for 255 yuan, "Phoenix" brand for 253 yuan, and miscellaneous brands for 201 yuan.

Soap traders and hoarders, seeing the prices of all goods rising, are actively hoarding again. The market feels lively, and prices are rising. Yesterday, "Gu Ben" soap was at 22.40 yuan, "Xiang Mao" soap at 16 yuan, and "Bai Xiang Mao" at 20.08 yuan.

There have been many rumors in the market about foreign candles in recent days, with talk of strikes in the water and electricity sectors. Due to extremely scarce inventory, prices are also high. Yesterday, "Ship" brand sold for 18.40 yuan, "Chicken" brand for 18 yuan, and miscellaneous brands for 16 yuan. (Kun)

### Piece Goods: Singapore Actively Purchases Cotton Cloth, Factory Prices Rise Steadily

Chinese Cloth: Yesterday, the market trend was firm and rising, with factory prices steadily increasing. Traders and wholesalers on this street actively absorbed supplies, and trading increased sharply. The selling price of white cotton cloth (coarse and fine twill) rose by 0.25 to 0.50 yuan per bolt. Dyed cloth also mostly increased by 1.10 to 1.30 yuan per bolt. Printed goods remained stable. On Mu Street, about 1,300 pieces of gray cloth, dyed cloth, and coarse cloth were traded. On North Road, the Yantai group traded over 200 pieces of coarse cloth, flannel, and serge. The Guangdong-Hong Kong group traded 200-300 pieces of twill and dyed cloth. The Zhejiang-Fujian group traded nearly 200 pieces of dyed cloth and dyed twill. Over 5,000 bolts of dyed cloth, bleached twill, and dyed khaki were sold overseas to places like Singapore.

Eastern Cloth: Customer demand from Yantai and Tianjin is strong, and sentiment on this street is also good. Selling prices are gradually rising. "Dragon Head" fine cloth opened at 34.12 yuan in the morning. In the afternoon, fewer were selling and more were buying. The situation became stronger, closing at 34.60 yuan. "Four Gentlemen" serge opened at 0.99 yuan per yard.

Today, 595 pieces of cotton cloth were exported to Hong Kong.

### Oil Cakes: Soybean Oil Rises About a Yuan, Market Dominated by Speculation

Yesterday, the edible oil market was unremarkable at the opening, and trading was not very active. Prices saw a slight correction. However, speculators were actively trading, pushing prices up and down rapidly, resulting in little overall change. Soybean oil remained firm, with tight pricing. 50 pieces of Yantai soybean oil were traded at a price of 78.50 yuan. 100 barrels of Qingdao soybean oil were priced at 203-204 yuan. 300 loads of "Da You" factory soybean oil were priced at 85.70 to 87 yuan. Groundnut oil saw 200 pieces of Jiaozhou oil traded at 70 to 69.50 yuan. 500 pieces for October delivery were priced at 69.75 yuan. 1,200 pieces for late October delivery were priced at 71 to 71.75 yuan. 150 barrels of Qingdao soybean oil were priced at 96 to 97.50 yuan. 100 barrels for early October delivery were priced at 97 yuan. 500 barrels for late October delivery were priced at 98 to 98.50 yuan.

### Silk and Tea: New York Silk Prices Rise, Local Market Lacks Activity

Yesterday, the New York silk market suddenly rose, with near-term contracts up 3 cents, deferred contracts up 5 cents, and spot prices up 2 cents, breaking the previous stagnant trend. At the same time, trading volume on the exchange was exceptionally active, with 1,630 loads traded (compared to only 10-20 loads per day in the past month). Yokohama spot prices rose only 10 yuan, while deferred contracts fell 6 yuan. This is because tensions in the Pacific are increasing. Even if Japan and the United States do not engage in military conflict, their economic conflicts will become sharper. After the U.S. ban on scrap iron exports, purchases of Japanese silk may also be affected. This is why New York silk prices have increased. Local trading lacks activity and will likely remain stagnant in the near future.

### Metals: "Hui Si" Iron is Quite Firm

The main buyers of "Hui Si" iron are canneries on this street, followed by toy factories, printing factories, and biscuit companies. In addition, customers from Tianjin, Yantai, and other places also occasionally seek supplies, but in smaller quantities than before. Therefore, under this trend, those holding goods are quite confident. Furthermore, with no spot goods arriving from overseas, prices will undoubtedly rise. Dark market prices are 4-5 yuan higher than before. Yesterday, the asking price for "Old Steel Factory" goods was 175 yuan per case, "New Steel Factory" goods were 165 yuan per case, and "Wild Chicken" goods were priced between 120-150 yuan, without a fixed standard.

### British Tram and Bus Services to Resume This Morning, Yu Qiaqing Resolves Dispute Reasonably, French Strike Negotiations to Begin Soon

Following strikes by workers at the British-owned Shanghai Tram Company and China Bus Company in the International Settlement, and workers at the French-owned Tram Company in the French Concession, direct negotiations between labor and management of the respective companies did not achieve a satisfactory resolution. As a result, tram and bus services in the International Settlement were completely suspended. While the French Concession managed to maintain some services with police protection, very unfortunate incidents occurred. Residents of the settlements experienced extreme inconvenience. After Mr. Yu Qiaqing and Mr. Yuan Lvdeng of the Chinese Ratepayers' Association accepted a request from the workers to mediate, the strike wave at the tram company and bus company in the International Settlement was successfully resolved yesterday. Workers at both companies are scheduled to resume work this morning, and tram and bus services will resume simultaneously. Negotiations on improved treatment conditions raised by workers at the French-owned Tram Company are about to begin, and it is not difficult to find a solution.

Tram Workers to Resume Work, Mr. Yu Qiaqing to Mediate

Labor and management at the tram company in the International Settlement had been deadlocked for a week due to the tram strike, causing serious transportation difficulties. Therefore, both sides were eager to find a solution quickly. Although negotiations had been held several times, they all ended in failure. Until 7:00 PM the night before last, four representatives of the tram union met with Mr. Yu Qiaqing, stating the current hardships of the workers and requesting him to uphold justice. Mr. Yu agreed to mediate immediately, and the management also expressed its willingness to accept outside mediation. Thus, the week-long strike took a sudden turn for the better.

Sincere Negotiations Lasted a Long Time

According to a report from the Dazhong News Agency, at 11:00 AM yesterday, four labor representatives from the tram company went to the Shipping Club on Wuma Road again to meet with Mr. Yu Qiaqing, saying that all workers were very supportive of Mr. Yu's mediation and that management must accept the workers' preconditions for resuming work. Mr. Yu agreed to relay this to management. At 4:00 PM, the tram union received a call from management saying that it would send representatives to the tram company headquarters on South Suzhou Road to negotiate. The labor side immediately sent four representatives to the headquarters. Mr. Yu and Gu Bingyuan of the Industrial Affairs Mediation Division of the Public Works Department of the International Settlement also attended. Mr. Hu Ziyu, the general manager of the company, represented management. The two sides negotiated in a harmonious manner for two hours before reaching a satisfactory resolution.

Management Accepts Preconditions

The preconditions for resuming work proposed by labor and accepted by management are recorded as follows: (1) Increase wages by 0.18 yuan per day and subsidize rice by 0.17 yuan (starting from October 1); (2) Workers' operational errors will still be handled as usual, but no striking workers will be dismissed; (3) Wages for the strike period will be paid for five days (wage increases will still be given); (4) The company will consider and negotiate on the labor-management mutual benefit agreement and resolve it within two weeks.

All Trams to Run This Morning

After the negotiation was resolved, the labor side immediately notified the workers to resume work this morning. It is reported that more than 3,000 workers in the car, machinery, and other departments have complied with the order and will go to work this morning according to the company's schedule. The company has sent workers to inspect the tracks on all routes in order to resume tram and trolleybus services. It is reported that starting this morning, all tram routes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9, and trolleybus routes 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, and 24 in the International Settlement will resume services. However, before the strike at the French-owned Tram Company in the French Concession is resolved, trams on all routes will temporarily suspend services into the French Concession.

Mr. Yu Hopes for Labor-Management Cooperation

After mediating the labor dispute at the bus and tram companies in the International Settlement yesterday, Mr. Yu Qiaqing told a reporter from the Dazhong News Agency that the strikes at the British-owned bus and tram companies were not only damaging to both sides, but also detrimental to the overall social security. Fortunately, this matter has been resolved. However, the rising cost of living has not decreased. He hopes that management can take into account the living conditions of labor, and that labor should also consider the future of management's business. If labor-management cooperation is implemented, not only will conflicts between the two sides not occur, but also unnecessary sacrifices can be avoided. This is what is urgently needed between labor and management at present.

Bus Services to Resume This Morning, Labor-Management Mediators Negotiate Together

The strike at the British-owned China Bus Company in the International Settlement had been going on for five days. After the labor side submitted four preconditions to the company at 2:00 PM the day before yesterday, yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, labor representatives went to Mr. Yu Qiaqing's residence to discuss the labor's true intentions. Then, Mr. Yu accompanied the representatives to the company's main office at 111 Sassoon House on Nanjing Road and the Bund to begin negotiations with company representatives. The four preconditions proposed by labor were: (1) Increase the daily living allowance by 0.50 yuan; (2) Pay wages for the strike period; (3) Do not dismiss workers without cause; (4) Resolve the 23 articles of the labor-management mutual benefit agreement within one week.

### Rice Prices Related to Social Order, Suppression is Urgent, National Rice Reaches New High of 90 Yuan Yesterday, Tightening Credit Makes Market Stagnant

Rice merchants hold tea parties and market sales, and dark market trading has been rampant in recent days, with the market extremely chaotic and filled with rumors. After opening at 7:30 AM yesterday as usual, people became more confident, and the order was very chaotic. The rising trend was boiling, and the dark market soared. The Market Management Committee immediately took emergency measures, sending additional personnel to and from the market to monitor the trading of fellow traders. If it is found that the traded rice and grains have not been immediately completed with transaction slips, it will be considered an illegal transaction. Police detectives stationed in the market by the two concession authorities are also closely watching the baseless rumors of the market brokers. Although the general rice speculators have been largely restrained, they are still whispering to each other, attempting to aggressively raise market prices. So-called "scalping" transactions are emerging one after another.

Aggressive Price Increases

However, the Market Management Committee's measures are not an effective way to stabilize rice prices. The committee has a responsibility for illegal transactions such as dark market trading in the market. The two concession authorities have discussed concrete measures to stabilize the entire rice market, but their effective implementation cannot be delayed. Yesterday morning's market trading resulted in a rise of 2-3 yuan per stone, with national rice reaching a new high of 90 yuan. Even better rice and grains could not be purchased. Buyers such as shopkeepers, due to the soaring market prices and tightening credit, are not as willing to buy as before.

Chinese and Foreign Attention

The frequent rise in rice prices means that ordinary people can no longer afford to live, which is related to the entire social order and cannot be ignored. The recent series of labor disputes are also largely due to the rise in rice prices. For the general salaried class, their daily income is unlikely to be able to cope with the minimum cost of living. Therefore, the four million Chinese and foreign residents of Shanghai all hope that the two concession authorities will take emergency measures to severely punish rice speculators according to law, enforce the rice market trading rules, deploy additional personnel to be stationed in the market for close monitoring, and order the Rice and Grain Valuation Committee to immediately resume its work, re-evaluate lower standard market prices, and strictly enforce them. Otherwise, the entire rice market in Shanghai will be unthinkable.

Adequate Inventory

Regarding the rice stocks in Shanghai's rice warehouses, they are extremely full. Yesterday, it was learned from the Shanghai Rice and Grain Valuation Committee that the committee had started investigating the rice stocks in the warehouses last Thursday and completed it yesterday, and announced the following: a total of more than 600,000 bags of grain are stored, calculated at 1.25 stones per bag, amounting to about 750,000 stones. Currently, the daily consumption of the city is only about 9,000 stones. Therefore, based on the warehouse stocks alone, it is enough to meet the food needs of the city's residents for three months. The committee has separately reported this to the two concession authorities and relevant rice industry groups for their reference. In addition, Hong Kong foreign rice in storage is being loaded onto ships and transported to Shanghai to be sold on the market in a steady stream. The number of national rice arriving in Shanghai is also increasing daily.

Rice Orders Placed

A reporter from Pingming News Agency learned that foreign exchange rates have recently eased, making it possible to match foreign rice prices. Therefore, yesterday, rice merchants first tentatively ordered 1,000 tons of No. 2 Saigon rice from Jianyuan Foreign Firm (equivalent to 10,000 bags, priced at 80 yuan per bag, equivalent to 160 catties), which has been transacted and is expected to arrive in Shanghai by the middle of next month. If the black market exchange rate eases on Monday, another 3,000 tons (30,000 bags) are expected to be transacted.

Satisfactory Resolution, Agreement Reached

The attendees at this negotiation included Chinese Directors Yu Qiaqing and Yuan Lvdeng, Gu Bingyuan, Director of the Industrial Affairs Mediation Division, Company Representatives Zhang Delan, Head of Car Affairs, Interpreter Hu Yimeng, and worker representatives (including drivers, ticket sellers, and workers from three departments), totaling 12 people. Both sides exchanged opinions with an open and candid attitude, and carefully discussed solutions. At 6:00 PM, a satisfactory resolution was reached, and the following agreement was established: (1) All workers will receive an increase of 0.35 yuan per person per day in their living allowance (effective from September 1), and other benefits for workers such as rice and grain will remain the same; (2) Wages will be paid for the strike period (that is, the entire salary for September will be paid, but the double wages for the four days during the tram strike will not be paid); (3) Workers will not be dismissed unless there is a major fault; (4) The company will respond to the labor side's 23 articles of the labor-management mutual benefit agreement on September 5, and all workers will accept it.

Notify Workers to Resume Work This Morning

After the above negotiation was satisfactorily concluded, the labor side immediately notified the workers in each department that they would resume work this morning. All 11 bus routes within the concession will be able to operate in full. The 23 articles have been satisfactorily resolved yesterday, and the labor and management will no longer negotiate. The five-day bus strike has thus been completely resolved. It is also learned that the rapid and smooth resolution of this strike was due to the harmonious relationship between labor and management, both of whom were able to act in good faith. Secondly, the efforts of the concession authorities and Mr. Yu and Mr. Yuan to mediate were also important factors in eliminating the strike.

French Tram Negotiations in Progress, Sincere Interaction Will Not Be Difficult to Resolve

After the workers of the French Tram Company went on strike on the 25th of this month, the workers proposed 16 articles requesting improved treatment conditions, and representatives were officially sent to the company in a letter a few days ago. The company has now translated it into French, and the director and the car affairs director Maxina are studying it article by article. A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency learned from the worker side yesterday that labor and management will officially start negotiations today, but the time has not yet been fixed. Since today is Sunday, a regular holiday, the negotiations may be changed to Monday. It is reported that the workers hope that the company will accept the workers' demands in order to avoid prolonging and expanding the strike. The company expressed its willingness to negotiate openly and honestly, so the strike at the French Water and Electricity Company will not be difficult to resolve.

Labor Representatives Visited Mr. Yu Yesterday

The strikes at the French Water and Electricity Company's trams, trolleybuses, and buses have reached three days, and the company's total losses have reached more than 100,000 yuan. In order to seek a rapid solution to the strike, the labor side specially sent representatives to visit Mr. Yu Qiaqing yesterday afternoon to state the labor's difficult living situation and request his mediation. Mr. Yu said that he would proceed after the mediation of the British bus and tram companies was completed. Therefore, it is expected that the transportation strikes in the French Concession will also be developed within the day. It is also learned that Mr. Yu mediated the transportation strikes in the International Settlement from morning to evening yesterday before completing them, so the mediation of the transportation strikes in the French Concession needs to start today and tomorrow.

Main Routes Maintain Normal Services

In order to maintain public transportation within the concession, the company tried to maintain traffic under the protection of armed police, although unfortunately incidents occurred, resulting in innocent passengers being injured, the company expressed regret, but for the sake of overall traffic, so yesterday the police still maintained traffic under strict protection, a total of 30 vehicles drove out of Route 2 (Sixteen Pups to Xujiahui), Route 7 (Sixteen Pups to Shanzhong Road), Route 10 (Sixteen Pups to Lujiazhen), not including trailers. Chinese and Vietnamese police officers were stationed at each tram station, and the guard was very strict. However, each vehicle traveled very slowly to prevent accidents, and returned to the factory early in the evening.

### Purchase of Small Denomination Stamps Requires Sufficient Change

The Shanghai Postal Administration and its branches have posted notices saying, "It has been found that there is an abnormal shortage of change in the market recently. For all members of the public purchasing stamps, for amounts less than 0.10 yuan, please bring sufficient change. Otherwise, this bureau can only provide stamps of equal value. This is hereby notified."

### Lone Army Commander Xie Hosts Tour, Reports on Details of Incident, Soldiers Work Hard and Are Very Healthy

Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, Commander Xie Jinyuan of the Lone Army in the Singapore Road camp hosted members of the press and published a detailed account of the incident. His conclusion included four points: (1) This incident was due to a general misconception underestimating the Lone Army. But the Lone Army is a Chinese revolutionary soldier, and they will not hesitate to make any sacrifice to maintain the dignity of a soldier. (2) Our retreat was not surrender. We live here in seclusion, obeying order. All expenses are provided by the government. (3) In solving the current environmental pressures, there are many considerations, and it is impossible to make any demands. Therefore, we are deeply saddened by the comrades who died or were injured. In addition to reserving future negotiations, we will adhere to the government's position and strive to work hard in sports, education, and industry to serve the country in the future. Although there are not many words, the intention is good, and the brave and courageous spirit is admirable. He is truly worthy of being a model soldier of modern times.

Wang Squad Leader's Tomb

He then personally led a tour of the tomb of Squad Leader Wang, who recently died in the incident, which was covered with a fresh wreath. Several soldiers were busy building a small garden around it. He then accompanied reporters to the barracks lecture hall, sports field, and other places. All the soldiers seen were either playing soccer or basketball, galloping in the field. Although their skin was slightly dark, they were all strong and healthy. Mr. Xie told people that since promoting sports, the soldiers have become healthier. Only nine people were sent to the hospital for treatment this year, which shows the remarkable effect of exercise.

Working Hard to Produce

He then led a tour of the workshops where the products were made. In addition to attending classes every day, the soldiers also hired technicians to teach various small crafts, such as knitting socks, rattan work, driving cars, and making soap, so that everyone could learn a skill. The soap and socks produced have been selling well in schools, and the prices are low and the quality is excellent, which has been praised by the general buyers. Mr. Xie also said that he originally planned to imitate toothpaste, but it has been temporarily suspended due to the high cost. Soon after, he entered the cooperative and other places, where the workers were diligent in their work and were respectful to their superiors. Then they said goodbye and left.

### Jin Cheng and Other Banks Reduce Deposit Interest Rates, Limited to Current and Demand Deposits, Many Depositors Switch to Savings Certificates

The Shanghai banking industry, in view of the sluggishness of industry and commerce, the abundance of idle funds, and the difficulty of using funds, has taken measures to reduce interest rates. Zi Jianye, Jin Cheng, Zhong Nan, Da Lu, and the Four Banks Savings Association, etc., will reduce all interest rates by 0.1% on current and demand deposits, whether in the commercial department, savings department, or trust department, starting from October 1.

Encourage Savings

In order to strengthen production and construction, cultivate thrift and virtues, and promote the National Savings for National Construction Movement, the authorities established the National Savings for National Construction Movement Committee and the National Savings Promotion Committee. After active promotion, savings promotion branches have been widely established in major areas of Sichuan and Zhejiang provinces to organize savings groups in order to widely complete savings promotion, thereby concentrating national financial resources and promoting construction projects.

Savings Opportunities

In order to encourage the public to participate, the authorities have also decided by the General Office of the Four Banks Joint Office to increase the interest on savings certificates and strictly stipulate that savings deposits are only for production and construction purposes. Shanghai is full of idle funds, and the banks have felt that they cannot use the deposits and have implemented interest rate cuts, giving the safe opportunity to transfer local funds from Shanghai. It is reported that various circles are enthusiastically entrusting related organizations to purchase savings certificates for savings.

### Most White Russian Residents Do Not Want to Violate Court Agreements, Dissatisfied with Immigration Committee Setting Up Arbitration Tribunal, Civil and Criminal Cases Should Be Under Jurisdiction of Local Courts

The China Press reports that the head of the White Russian Immigration Committee in this city, Ivanov, in order to avoid the White Russian residents in Shanghai being placed under the jurisdiction of another court, moved the jurisdiction from the two special district courts to another place, causing disputes, has agreed with the authorities outside the borders to set up another

Arbitration Tribunal

to hear all civil cases of White Russians. It is found that the relevant authorities have recently decided to place these 26,000 White Russians under the jurisdiction of another court, but most White Russians oppose this. According to White Russian officials, this move violates the court agreement and will cause

Many Disputes

Chinese civil and criminal laws stipulate that the courts in the area where the civil or criminal case occurred or in the area where the party concerned belongs have jurisdiction over the parties concerned. If a White Russian residing in the French Concession commits a crime in the International Settlement and is transferred to another place for trial, it is actually

Destroying Criminal Law

Furthermore, it is questionable whether the police departments of the two concessions will transfer White Russians who commit crimes within their borders to be tried outside the borders. And the implementation of civil cases on White Russians will be difficult. Therefore, even if Ivanov and the outside authorities agree to establish an arbitration tribunal and the White Russians judge themselves, the problem of the White Russian residents in Shanghai not being placed under the jurisdiction of the court has not been resolved.

### Former French Concession Supervisor Awarded, Concession Gold Medal, Former Public Works Bureau Supervisor and French Consul General Eugene

The French Concession Public Works Bureau Supervisor J. Brediam has submitted a request to the Board of Directors to be released from his duties due to other jobs, and will leave office on the 30th of this month, which has been approved by the Board of Directors.

Brediam, the supervisor of the Bureau, requesting approval to be released from his duties on September 30, 1940, the contract will be terminated by mutual consent. It has been approved. It is a pity that the supervisor has finally left the Bureau. I hereby express my gratitude in my name and on behalf of all the directors of the Bureau for his loyalty and cooperation in the Bureau. The Bureau also resolved to follow the chairman's suggestion and award the Bureau Supervisor J. Brediam a gold medal of the Concession to reward him for his excellent work in the French Concession. It also announced that the former Consul General Eugene had left office and returned to France. It was found that under his chairmanship, his achievements were remarkable.

### Congestion on Various Sections of the Longhai Railway; Post Office Implements Registration; No Acceptance Before Registration; Resumption of Commercial Parcels on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Line

Following the announcement by the Municipal Postal Administration on the 23rd of this month regarding the resumption of parcel deliveries on the Longhai and Jinpu lines, those rushing to send parcels have caused considerable congestion. To alleviate this, the Administration has implemented a registration system to limit the volume. Anyone wishing to send commercial parcels on the aforementioned lines must first register at the Administration between 2:30 PM and 3:00 PM daily. No temporary acceptance of parcels will be allowed without prior registration.

Furthermore, due to excessive accumulation of commercial parcels destined for Qingdao, acceptance of such parcels will be temporarily suspended starting from the 30th of this month. However, commercial parcels to various locations along the Shanghai-Hangzhou railway line can be resumed from the 30th of this month.

### Human Trafficking Organization Busted; Details of the Arrest by the Police - Details of the Case Solved by the Municipal Council Police

From April 7th to 11th of this year, the Police Department of the Municipal Council uncovered a large-scale human trafficking organization, arresting ten male and female kidnappers in the eastern district of the Public Concession and the French Concession. Four kidnapped children were also rescued. The organization was quite extensive, specializing in luring children under eight years old in Shanghai. Sometimes, children playing on the streets were lured away with food by gang members and handed over to female accomplices for safekeeping. Efforts were then made to send them to Xiamen, where an organization run by two Taiwanese individuals would handle the trafficking. Before being shipped out, the kidnapped children were taught by the female accomplices to call them "Mama" in order to deceive police officers during boarding and landing.

Assistance in Apprehension

During the investigation, forty photographs of children were also discovered. These photos were taken when applying for travel permits prior to boarding. Twenty-four of these photos were identified by parents who had lost their children. In addition, a large number of the children's original clothing was seized, twenty-three sets of which were also identified by the owners. To locate the whereabouts of the missing children, the Police Department attached explanations to the photos and sent them to police agencies in Xiamen, Hong Kong, and Macau for assistance.

Over a Hundred Cases

The ten male and female kidnappers arrested were found to be involved in over one hundred cases in Shanghai. They were jointly escorted to the Special First Court for interrogation. As a result, on May 9th, one was sentenced to twelve years of imprisonment, two to fourteen years, and six to fifteen years. One female suspect was acquitted. All the convicts were then transferred to the French Concession Police Department for further investigation. On August 4th, the Police Department sent detectives to Xiamen to work with local police officers to investigate the kidnapped children and apprehend the traffickers.

All Accomplices

On the 10th of the same month, security guards serving on a ship of the Java Shipping Company arrested a woman. The woman was accompanied by two children. Investigation revealed that the two children had been kidnapped in the eastern district of Shanghai and were intended to be taken to Xiamen for sale. Subsequently, the Water Police and the Police Department searched several locations and apprehended four more suspects and rescued four children. Investigation confirmed that these suspects were accomplices of the previous kidnappers. They were sent to court for trial. As a result, two men were acquitted by the court on the 28th of the same month due to insufficient evidence.

Sales Contracts

Detectives dispatched by the Police Department to Xiamen, in conjunction with local police officers, arrested five male and female suspects and two Taiwanese individuals on Gulangyu Island in Xiamen. They also recovered sixteen trafficked children from Chinese families who had purchased them. In addition, it was determined that some of the trafficked children had already been taken by buyers to Southeast Asia, Rangoon, and the Philippines. Each time these sixteen kidnapped children were sold, contracts were drawn up, with the buyers adopting them as foster children. The sellers would guarantee that the children were their biological offspring and not kidnapped. In reality, the names of the guarantors, intermediaries, and those posing as the children's parents were all fabricated.

Verdict Pending

Five male and female suspects in this case, four of whom have been transferred to Shanghai, while the other one remains in custody by the Gulangyu Island police for continued investigation into the whereabouts of other missing children. As for the two Taiwanese individuals, they have been handed over to the Japanese authorities there for handling. The four male and female convicts who were transferred, along with the three suspects arrested at sea on August 10th, have all been sent to court. The verdict in this case is still pending.

Photos Awaiting Identification

The aforementioned sixteen children have not yet been transferred to Shanghai and will remain there until their families identify their photographs. Currently, the photographs of seven of the children have been identified by their families as having been kidnapped in the two concessions of this city last year and this year. The remaining children's photographs have been published in various Chinese newspapers in this city for identification. In addition, the Hong Kong authorities sent over one hundred photographs of children to Shanghai, claiming that these children were suspected of being kidnapped. However, no one has been able to positively identify them after the photos were published in the newspapers.

### Shi Jiutang's Condition Still Critical; Bullet Extracted Yesterday

Mr. Shi Jiutang, a lawyer in this city, was shot at his office on the third floor of No. 24 Central Road last week. The bullet entered his face through the nasal cavity and lodged in the back of his head. He was initially sent to Renji Hospital, but because the bullet was lodged in the skull and difficult to extract, his family transferred him to Gongji Hospital for treatment. Details were previously reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that the bullet was successfully extracted yesterday by doctors using surgery. There was significant bleeding during the procedure, so it is still undetermined whether Mr. Shi's life is out of danger.

### Bomb Explosion in a Gambling Den in Ximen; Four Gamblers Injured

Yesterday afternoon around 5:00 PM, a gambling den in Xiyuan, Zhonghua Road, Laoximen, Nanshi, was the scene of an explosion. As gamblers were enthusiastically engaged in their games, a thug suddenly pulled out a hand grenade and threw it inside. With a loud bang, it exploded, instantly filling the room with thick smoke and flying shrapnel. Four gamblers, who were directly in the path of the explosion, sustained severe injuries and collapsed in pools of blood, unconscious. The gamblers, shocked by the sight, fled in panic, screaming and scrambling for their lives. Women and children were knocked to the ground, their cries shaking the heavens, causing utter chaos. Police officers arrived to maintain order and closed the iron doors of the gambling den for investigation. However, the grenade thrower had already escaped without a trace. The four injured were rushed to the hospital in police vehicles for treatment. Their injuries are serious and their lives are in danger. Many others with minor injuries sought treatment at hospitals on their own.

### Gunman in the Gao Xinbao Murder Case Executed

Gao Xinbao, a prominent figure in Shanghai, was shot and killed on March 15th of this year in front of the Yipinxin Hotel. The murderer remained at large. Despite the efforts of the concession police authorities to investigate, the case remained unsolved. According to a reporter from the Huawen News Agency, the mastermind behind the murder was Sun Shucheng, a notorious gangster in the Caojiabo area of western Shanghai. Sun, also known as "Little Old Third," was the owner of the Fuji Gambling Den, 41 years old, from Zhenjiang, and had a large number of henchmen. On the day Gao Xinbao was murdered, Wang A'er (18 years old, from Funing, Jiangbei), one of his henchmen, carried out the attack. Sun and Wang were subsequently arrested by the authorities in western Shanghai. After repeated interrogations, the two confessed without hesitation. They were executed by firing squad at 3:20 PM on the 27th.

### Xiang Sheng Taxi Hijacked in Western Shanghai Yesterday; Vehicle Recovered; Cause of Hijacking Under Investigation

The company dispatched taxi number 18436, driven by Yan Dezhu (32 years old, from Chongming). After the man boarded the taxi, he ordered the driver to drive to Bailinan Road, Caojiadu. When the taxi reached the location and stopped abruptly, three men suddenly emerged from a nearby shack and approached the taxi. Two of them pulled out guns, forcing the driver to get out of the car. Yan Dezhu, seeing the guns, dared not resist and got out of the car. One of the men temporarily detained Yan in the shack, forbidding him from making any noise. The other two men then got into the taxi and sped away. The driver was released around 1:00 PM. At the same time, the taxi was found on New Singapore Road near Xiede Road. The police are conducting a thorough investigation into the cause of the hijacking.

### Former Chinese Inspector of the French Police Department, Lu Zhucai, Reinstated

Lu Zhucai, a native of Yancheng and a Chinese Inspector in the French Police Department, has served in the French Police Department for many years and has solved many major cases, earning him considerable merit. He resigned from his position as inspector-general due to illness last year. Recently, the police authorities, in dire need of talent, recognized Lu's diligence and dedication during his tenure and ordered Lu's reinstatement to his original position the day before yesterday. Upon receiving the order, Mr. Lu reported for duty yesterday. Friends and relatives, upon hearing the news, went to congratulate him. Some colleagues planned to hold a banquet to welcome him. Mr. Lu, considering the current difficult times, was unwilling to be extravagant and waste the resources of his friends and relatives, so he politely declined all offers.

### Letter to the Editor

To the esteemed editor: I have read today's report in your newspaper regarding a tramcar No. 17 of the French Tramway Company which, on the 27th (i.e., yesterday), was bombed with a sulfur grenade at the intersection of Avenue Joffre and Rue Pere Robert, resulting in injuries to eight passengers. There are several inaccuracies in the report. As our company bears full responsibility, we hereby issue a statement to clarify the matter. At noon on September 27th, a tramcar No. 17 of our company, heading east from Shanxi, was indeed approached by several thugs posing as passengers at the Rue Pere Robert station. They mixed among the passengers and ignited flammable phosphorus material stored in small glass bottles hidden in their shoes, intending to disrupt public order. However, this small amount of phosphorus could not have harmed anyone. When passengers saw the thick smoke in the car, they all rushed to escape, resulting in a foot abrasion to one woman. As for your newspaper's claim that eight passengers were injured by flying shrapnel, it is entirely unfounded and clearly based on inaccurate reporting. We hereby issue this correction. Sincerely, Shanghai French Tramway Company, September 28th.

### Shanghai Children's Library Preparatory Committee Held Inaugural Meeting Yesterday; Yu Qiaqing, Zhao Jinqing, etc., Elected as Committee Members

The Shanghai Children's Library Preparatory Committee held its inaugural meeting at the Bankers' Association Club yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM. Over a hundred prominent figures from all walks of life, including Yuan Ludeng, Wen Lanting, Zhang Shouyong, Huang Jingwan, Chen Xuanshan, Chen Zhengfan, and Zhang Guoquan, gathered together in a lively atmosphere. The meeting proceeded as scheduled, with Yuan Ludeng as chairman and Zheng Zulin as recorder. The chairman delivered the opening address.

Chairman Yuan Ludeng's Opening Address

Mr. Yuan briefly stated, "Today is the day of the inaugural ceremony of the Shanghai Children's Library Preparatory Committee. I am deeply honored to be able to participate. The movement to establish a Shanghai Children's Library was initiated by the Shanghai 9th Children's Day Celebration Preparatory Committee, which in turn was based on the suggestions of two children, Ying Chun-tung and Ying Chun-gao. Therefore, we can frankly say, 'The movement to establish a Shanghai Children's Library was actually initiated by the children of Shanghai themselves. We adults and parents are simply expressing our support, striving to promote, and completing this movement.' The Shanghai Children's Library Preparatory Committee was formed on April 4th of this year, but since no inaugural ceremony was held at the time, we are specifically holding this ceremony today to make up for it. The initial members of this preparatory committee were eleven organizations, including the Shanghai Office of the China Child Welfare Association, the Children's Protection Section of the Shanghai Municipal Council, the Shanghai Children's Care Association, and the Shanghai Street Children Education Association. These eleven organizations felt the need to unite with a majority of local comrades to jointly strive for the establishment of a children's library. Therefore, after forming this preparatory committee, they immediately elected seven executive directors, including Hu Zuyin, Huang Jingwan, and Zhang Guoquan, and requested them to find ways to appoint over eighty additional committee members and carefully draft many regulations. They then solemnly invited comrades from many fields to participate in today's inaugural ceremony. From this, we can understand that these eleven organizations absolutely do not want to monopolize the movement to prepare for the children's library, because this is a local issue in Shanghai. Therefore, they want to gather the strength of people from all walks of life in society to jointly promote this movement. Many people have come to participate in the inaugural ceremony today, and I hope everyone can recognize this meaning, express their enthusiastic support, and work together. Of course, there is no easy task in the world, but we must take a spirit of not fearing difficulties to overcome all difficulties. Talking about establishing a children's library may require 150,000 yuan, maybe 100,000 yuan, or at least 50,000 yuan or 30,000 yuan. However, in today's Shanghai situation, the difficulty of raising funds is very clear to everyone. But even though the situation in Shanghai is like this, we don't have to be discouraged. I believe that as long as everyone is willing to work hard, we will definitely achieve considerable success. Our fundraising goal does not necessarily have to be too large. Even if we cannot immediately raise large amounts of donations to build this magnificent children's library, we can use a small amount of money to start on a small scale and then gradually expand and improve. There is a foreign saying, 'Rome was not built in a day.' We Chinese also say, 'To climb high, one must start from the bottom; to travel far, one must start from nearby.' Therefore, I hope that everyone can strive forward, abandon all concerns and worries, and work hard from all aspects to complete the movement to establish a children's library. As for the progress of the preparatory work, because Mr. Hu Zuyin will give a detailed report, I don't need to add much more."

Hu Zuyin Reports on the Progress of Preparations

Hu Zuyin then reported on the progress of the preparations, stating that the movement to establish the Shanghai Children's Library began in March of this year. The Shanghai 9th Children's Day Celebration Preparatory Committee, in response to the suggestions of two children, Ying Chun-gao and others, specifically initiated the movement to establish the Shanghai Children's Library and donated a total of 3,101.73 yuan at the conclusion of the Children's Day celebration for the establishment of the Shanghai Children's Library. The Celebration Preparatory Committee, at its third meeting on April 2nd, felt the importance of the movement to establish the Shanghai Children's Library and its complex nature. Therefore, on April 4th, it organized the Shanghai Children's Library Preparatory Committee to continue all preparatory work and decided to transfer all the funds raised to the Children's Library Preparatory Committee, hoping to rely on the continued efforts of all parties to complete the great goal of establishing the Shanghai Children's Library. The members of the preparatory committee are eleven organizations, including the Shanghai Office of the China Child Welfare Association, the Children's Protection Section of the Shanghai Municipal Council, the Shanghai Children's Care Association, the Shanghai Street Children Education Association, the Shanghai Poor Children Out-of-School Relief Center, the Shanghai Parent Education Research Association, the Shanghai Children's Hospital, the China Women and Children Relief Association, the Shanghai Refugee Relief Branch, the Chinese Medical Association, and the Shanghai Young Women's Christian Association. At its first meeting, the committee first established a design committee to be responsible for drafting regulations and studying the appointment of additional committee members. At its second meeting on April 26th, in addition to resolving to temporarily use the Shanghai Office of the China Child Welfare Association as a temporary office, the committee also elected Huang Jingwan, Hu Zuyin, Zhang Guoquan, Chen Zhengfan, Ding Bingnan, Dong Bin, and Zou Qi as executive directors to be responsible for properly handling various regulations, handling the appointment of additional committee members, and preparing to convene the inaugural meeting. The executive directors selected by the preparatory committee all promoted the preparatory work on a voluntary basis. The regulations stipulated that the entire executive committee would meet once every two weeks, and the standing executive committee would meet once a week. The executive directors extensively searched and collected information, and painstakingly studied and drafted no fewer than eight or nine types of regulations, such as the Articles of Association of the Shanghai Children's Library Preparatory Committee, the Rules of Procedure of the Shanghai Children's Library Preparatory Committee, the Measures for Fundraising for the Shanghai Children's Library Preparatory Committee, and the Measures for Collecting Books for the Shanghai Children's Library Preparatory Committee. In addition, they requested architect Mao Xinyi to design drawings for the construction of the library building and invited library science experts Lin Chongzhi and Lu Shaoyu to design the style of the mobile library car and drafted budget proposals, including draft budget proposals for renting a library site and operating mobile library car services, for the reference of future responsible personnel. In addition, Chen Zhengfan's respected father, Mr. Qiping, passed away a month ago. The executive committee of the Children's Library Preparatory Committee, admiring his moral example, specifically initiated a fundraising campaign to donate funeral gifts to the Children's Library as a permanent memorial. As of September 27, 1940, the Children's Library Preparatory Committee had received 539.60 yuan in funeral donations from friends of Mr. Chen in Shanghai. There are also grand plans for building a mansion, but I will not elaborate further.

Discussion of Motions and Election of Committee Members

Then, the motion was discussed. Ding Bingnan read the draft articles of association, which were passed in principle. Huang Jingwan proposed electing a nominating committee, and the chairman appointed Huang Jingwan, Zhang Guoquan, and Sun Choucheng as nominating committee members. The resolution was approved. The following people were immediately elected (honorary chairman): Yu Qiaqing, Zhao Jinqing, Wen Lanting, Zhang Shouyong, Mrs. Hemick; (honorary committee members): Wu Yunzhai, He Dekui, Xi Yushu, Xu Guanqun, Xu Xiaochu, Xu Jilou, Wang Boyuan, Qin Runqing, Sun Ruihuang, Cai Cong, Guo Shun, Guo Linshuang, Zheng Zhaobin, Chen Bingkun, Ding Fangzhen, Cui Fuzhuang, Zhang Rongchu, Zhu Boquan, Gao Shiheng, Li Zulai, Chen Zhusheng, Zhu Lide, Meng Lu Aide, Yang Nielingyu, Wei Pengdan, Zhou Shoujuan, Yan E'sheng, Li Wenjie, Li Yunzhou, Zhou Jianxue "Sun Choucheng, Dai Chunfeng, Fan Zhengkang; (standing committee members): Yuan Ludeng, Wu Weide, Fu Wenshou, Lu Gaoyi, Dong Renjian, Chen Qingshi, Hu Zuyin, Su Zengxiang, Qiu Liying, Huang Jingwan, Zhang Guoquan, Yun Huaigao, Chen Zhengfan, Ding Bingnan, Ying Yongyu, Lin Chongzhi, Zhu Yutao, Mao Xinyi, Zhang Yuanfu. The resolution was unanimously approved. Finally, Chen Xuanshan, deputy director of the Chinese Education Department of the Municipal Council, and Kong Minzhong, the former director of the library of Tsinghua University and the Library of the Central Research Institute, who had recently returned from studying in the United States, gave speeches. Their words were earnest and everyone enjoyed themselves.

### The Completion of the American Two-Ocean Navy

What is a two-ocean navy? Simply put, the original operational plan of the U.S. Navy only prepared to concentrate the entire fleet in the Pacific or the Atlantic to maintain national defense. To fight on both fronts simultaneously, the current strength is not enough. Now, the situation in the Pacific is deteriorating day by day, and the British Navy in the Atlantic is busy dealing with Germany and Italy. If the British fleet fails, wouldn't the United States have to deal with both the Pacific and Atlantic at the same time? Last month, the U.S. Congress passed a two-ocean navy bill, deciding to increase the existing naval fleet by 70 percent.

The current U.S. Navy, on the surface, can be considered the most powerful in the world (a total of 1,330,415 tons, with 397 warships of various types). The current U.S. fleet includes 15 battleships, 6 aircraft carriers, 17 cruisers, 237 destroyers, 102 submarines, and more than 1,300 fighters. According to recent reports, the British Navy has a total of 1,253,744 tons and 336 ships, both less than the United States. Japan, the world's third naval power, has a total of 241 warships, totaling 961,326 tons. The combined navies of Japan, Italy, and Germany exceed the U.S. by 409,323 tons. This is just the surface; no one really knows the number and speed of Japan's secretly built warships. The British Navy may be destroyed by the enemy; if so, when will it be? All this is unknown. The current 15 U.S. battleships can be said to be the most powerful in any navy in the world. However, their average age has reached 23 years. Three of them are too old, and Congress has allocated funds to improve their cannons and armor. Among the 237 destroyers, 109 are "old men" from the last World War and have recently been re-integrated into the fleet. The number of cruisers and aircraft carriers in the United States is far less than that of Britain and Japan.

As for the new ships being built in the United States, they can be divided into three categories: (1) those that have already been designed and ordered, (2) those that have already started construction in the dockyards, and (3) those that are being assembled, that is, the hull has been launched and is being fitted with armor and other equipment. If calculated by the year of completion, the number of new ships is as follows:

1944 - 2 battleships, 7 cruisers, 3 aircraft carriers (1 more in 1945).

The two-ocean navy bill passed by the U.S. Congress in mid-August will increase the existing and planned fleet by 70 percent (1,325,000 tons). After this new plan is completed, the United States will have an invincible navy in the world, capable of dealing with enemies in the Pacific and Atlantic at the same time. At that time, the U.S. Navy will have 1,500 aircraft, 35 battleships (several of which are 45,000-ton super battleships), 20 aircraft carriers, 88 cruisers, 378 destroyers, and 180 submarines.

Currently, major U.S. dockyards are already busy rushing to build ships, but Americans are very anxious and impatiently ask, when will this paper fleet become a reality and float on the sea? Of course, the U.S. shipbuilding plan cannot be completed in three or two months. However, according to Rear Admirals Robinson and Maliel, if the United States focuses its mind, manpower, and money on building ships, it will take until 1946 or 1947 to complete everything.

In the eyes of anxious "landlubbers," this shipbuilding plan is simply too slow. In fact, in the eyes of insiders who know the difficulty of this arduous task, it can be said that they are already catching up at full speed. Several naval dockyards (such as Brooklyn, Portsmouth, Norfolk, Boston, Mare Island, Charleston, Philadelphia, and Pungysampung) are already working day and night. Several private dockyards (such as Newport News Shipbuilding, Bethlehem, Bath Iron Works, Federal Shipbuilding, New York Shipbuilding, and Electric Boat Company) are also very busy building new ships. The three major steel plate manufacturers (such as Bethlehem, U.S. Steel, and Baldwin Company) have already fully processed steel. The steel plate factory established by the Navy Department in Charleston has doubled its output since last year, and will double again this year. Other factories related to shipbuilding are also planning how to increase their production. In short, Americans hope that the military expansion plan will be realized as soon as possible, which is a very obvious fact.

U.S. President Roosevelt and Secretary of the Navy Knox are also eagerly hoping that the shipbuilding plan can be completed as soon as possible. A closed-down Cramp shipyard in Philadelphia (which built many ships during World War I) is already planning to reopen. Other shipbuilding plants in the valley, such as Gijide, Los Angeles, Seattle, San Francisco, Beaumont, Tom Pay, Birmingham, Wakeland, and Wilmington, have been contacted and are ready to start work. Knox has consulted with Hillman of the Labor Defense Committee to send unemployed technicians from the interior to work along the coast. Working hours and wages in the dockyards have been increased.

According to Secretary of the Navy Knox and Chief of Naval Operations, Captain Stark, the new ships built by the U.S. Navy, including the two-ocean navy, are expected to be completed two or three years earlier than originally planned, that is, in 1944. This is really good news for the Americans, but people in military circles hope that all the new ships can join the war before the next naval battle occurs.

### Inspection of the English Channel

On the 17th of last month, an American reporter accompanied the German army on a three-day inspection of the French coast opposite England. The phenomenon he witnessed proved that Hitler is ready to attack England. Once the opportunity arrives, he will take surprising action again. On the surface, there are few signs that the German army will invade England soon. Many people believe that Hitler intends to invade England, and the German newspapers do not deny this. However, the German army's camouflage work along the French coast is extremely clever. If one does not observe carefully, one would not imagine that the invasion plan is already being arranged. Judging from all the phenomena, Hitler's preparation work is orderly and meticulous. It is not affected by wind direction, climate, or season, and can be launched at any time.

British aircraft often fly over the French coast at night, trying their best to disrupt the German army's preparation work. During the day, there are no longer the busy boats shuttling back and forth in the English Channel as in the past. The reporter drove back and forth along the coast between Ostend and Boulogne for three days, and never saw a British escort ship or a large ship in the Channel. Only two German minesweepers and a small fishing boat sailed forward quietly. In the ports of Ostend, Calais, and Dunkirk, the funnels of ships revealing above the water surface and the vessels stranded on the shallow beaches are everywhere, reminding people of the fierceness of the war at that time.

The airspace over the Channel is quite active. Airplanes soar and fly over, one after another without end. German Messerschmitt fighter planes are often seen flying high and fast like shooting stars. Fiercely armed fighter planes and the heaviest bomber squadrons, loaded with huge bombs, rumble westward toward England. German aircraft formations, divided into nine, eighteen, twenty-seven, and up to fifty or more, soar high in the sky, disappear into the clouds, and return in a moment, like silver fish breaking through the blue sky, re-armed and re-bombing.

On the French coast, only continuous explosions and British anti-aircraft fire can be heard from afar. Half an hour later, the German planes return, either in complete formation or scattered. Occasionally, there are also British fighter planes closely following the bombers, chasing relentlessly, exchanging fierce fire. German fighter planes also suddenly appear, attacking the British planes. In a few minutes, the fierce battle ends.

According to the impression obtained by the reporter inspecting the coast, the German side has heavily fortified its defenses to prevent a British counterattack.

### General de Gaulle

General de Gaulle of France was originally a military advisor to Renault. On June 24th, he called on his comrades in England to form the French National Committee and organized the French Volunteer Army. The British government fully supported it in economic and other aspects.

According to the Manchester Guardian, the British government recognizes General de Gaulle because he has no political affiliations. The committee is not a "hostile" group to the Vichy government, and its activities are limited, namely, to contact French patriotic soldiers in various places and continue to fight.

According to the Sunday Times, although the French Legion has become a part of the British Army, it still fights under the French flag, as do its naval and air force units. On July 2nd, Vice Admiral Muselier was appointed as the commander of the naval and air forces of the French Legion. On the 8th of that month, the Legion's London office began "recruiting soldiers." In fact, there was no real recruitment, because these French troops were already stationed in British barracks at that time. They were allowed to freely decide whether to return to France or continue to fight.

As for the number of de Gaulle's subordinates, it is uncertain, but it is known that it includes infantry, sailors, and pilots.

De Gaulle is nearly fifty years old and was promoted to general on May 26, 1934. He wrote a book predicting the Franco-German war, and nine out of ten predictions came true. The book has been translated into German. In his book, de Gaulle explained the combat effectiveness of motorized units, saying, "Armored vehicles will be heavily used, and amazing results will be produced due to the evolution of machinery."

### Seeking Knowledge in Life

— Wan

Ordinary people think that going to school is the only way to seek knowledge, and some children also think that reading a book is the only way to seek knowledge. Therefore, except for teachers forcing them to do arithmetic, write large and small characters, and memorize books, they do not ask about other things. This is not the proper attitude for us to seek knowledge. If a child truly seeks knowledge, he will never do his homework only because the teacher forces him to, nor will he only read textbooks. Because the knowledge in books is limited and vague. The times are changing rapidly. To be a modern little citizen, these learnings are not enough.

Therefore, in addition to seeking some fundamental knowledge in school, we must also seek it in life to find its truth. However, the scope of knowledge in life is very large, and its nature is changeable. If you pay attention at all times, then you will find difficulties and questions everywhere. If you do not pay attention, then you will know nothing, feel nothing, and live in the world in a muddleheaded way, like plants and animals. What use is it to only get some knowledge from books?

Newton invented gravity, Watt invented steam, and many other scientists. They did not all have superior intelligence to others, nor did everyone receive advanced learning. They started researching from questions in life, and after years or decades of hard work, they were able to achieve great careers.

In school, we seek knowledge with the teacher's supervision, which is passive. In life, we seek knowledge and we have to seek it ourselves. I briefly describe the method below:

(1) Pay attention at all times: We pay attention to problems in life at all times, whether it is as small as the structure and types of ants and their herding, or as large as the causes and backgrounds of international struggles.

(2) Ask questions: When encountering problems that cannot be solved, ask teachers and parents for guidance and help, or discuss with close friends and classmates, to obtain a correct answer.

(3) Observe carefully: Most children like to catch insects and the like. According to my usual experience, they do not observe them after catching them, but just play with them. When they don't want them, they throw them away. If it happens that these insects are also in the book, they memorize how many eyes and feet they have before the exam, but they forget it after memorizing it. They never want to look at the real insects clearly.

(4) Research: After observing something, you have to research it. Why are the colors of most insects green? Why does a praying mantis have two pincers? Research to find out how it is.

(5) Prove the theory: We compare what we have researched with the book to see if it matches and if what the book says is true.

After this series of procedures, we no longer need to memorize the words in the book. The cause and effect of this matter, the shape of this thing, is as if it is in front of our eyes. At the same time, after developing this orderly habit, it will be much easier to study and handle affairs in the future. Children! Let's quickly build a good foundation for our knowledge, and then expand and enrich it in life to reach the highest point!

### Talking about Posture

— Yong

There is a sitting posture, a standing posture, a reading posture, and a writing posture. In short, all actions have a certain posture. Incorrect posture not only affects physical health, but also has a related effect on mental aspects or work efficiency.

"Sit upright, stand straight, do not bend your back when writing..." I think all of you children have already heard similar words many times. So why am I bringing it up again today? Because the more common things are, the less people know how to put them into practice. Children are like this, and so are adults. The times have fostered bad postures, and it will be difficult to change them after entering society in the future. Therefore, it is even more important for children to have good postures than for adults.

In a book, posture is compared to a watch: "Although the internal mechanism of a watch is excellent, if it is equipped with a concave and crooked case, it cannot keep accurate time. The organs of the body can also fail to perform their duties properly due to incorrect posture of the bones." I hope you can remember this analogy. Modern China needs children with strong physiques, and to have strong physiques, you must start by developing good postures.

### The Monkey and the Walnut

— Shaonong

One day, a young monkey picked up a walnut on the road. He immediately happily put it in his mouth, but as soon as he chewed it, he frowned, feeling pain in his teeth. So, cursing and scolding, he said, "My mother must have lied to me the day before yesterday, because she said that the taste of walnuts is very sweet. How can I trust the words of the elderly in the future? They often deceive the young." Saying that, he threw the walnut on the side of the road.

At this time, another monkey picked up the walnut and broke it between two stones. So, while eating with relish, he said to the young monkey, "My dear companion, your mother is absolutely right. Walnuts are indeed very sweet, but you must break them open. You must remember that in this world, we can never get happiness without working."

### Typical Children

— Zhang Mengzhao

Children who are not afraid of hardship are good children, and students who can endure labor are good students. The author has seen that many middle and primary school students on the isolated island still indulge in enjoyment during the tram and bus strikes, and call for rickshaws or "wild chicken" taxis instead of walking. No matter how the rickshaw pullers shouted for exorbitant prices of seven, eight jiao, or one yuan, the students squandered their fathers' hard-earned money and did not care. You must know that walking is the only way to exercise the body and invigorate the muscles. If you cannot endure temporary labor, what prospects will you have for serving society in the future?

The author also read a good article by Mr. Bing Qian, "It's Autumn School Opening Again," which included a paragraph about primary school students. He said... "The international situation is so urgent, and old and new hatreds are intertwined. The responsibility of young people is even greater. During the summer vacation, I (Bing Qian referring to himself) returned to northern Jiangsu to spend the summer and talked with many young people, and felt their irrepressible vigor and vitality. A student who is only fourteen years old has to walk to school fifteen miles away every day, and has never been late. Compared with the decadence of young people on the sea, it is really incomparable..." etc. This primary school student can be called a "typical child"! It can also be said to be a model good student. Children! What are your thoughts after reading this?

### Shirley Temple's Autobiography (Sixteen)

— Min

Oh! Ke Gan, you must know how interesting it is to work in such a big photography studio as Fox! That morning, when Dad went to the bank to work, he always had to drive us there. There were police officers guarding the entrance of the photography studio, and now they all knew me. But when I started working, they didn't know who I was and immediately stopped me and asked, "Who are you? Where are you going?" At that time, Mom replied, "This is our daughter Shirley Temple. Today she is working in the film 'Stand Up and Cheer' on Stage Eight. This is her entrance pass." So they let us in.

We entered a corner of the photography studio, walked across a narrow bridge, and reached that corner, but had already entered a very fun old village. The houses in the village are all like ordinary houses, built of brownish-brown stones, with high and sloping roofs, with high small windows and quaint old chimneys, but no smoke comes out. Mom said that these are French, German, and Italian houses, and no one lives in them, but they are used as models. But in the purely American part of the photography studio, there are many beautiful small houses where people can live. One morning, Mom pointed to a house and said to me, "Look! Isn't that Lilian Harvey's bungalow very beautiful?" When I looked up, it was really beautiful, all blue and pink, with green grass on both sides, surrounded by a low fence, with no house number on it, but a French name, which I did not know. According to my teacher, Miss Buckland, its meaning is "Dream House." I think that's a good name. Mom often said that this is where my "dream house" finally came true. Do you know why? Because this beautiful house is now for me to live in.

The first big star I worked with was Jamie Dunn. I learned a song and a dance and performed with him in the film "Stand Up and Cheer." But you don't have to be afraid to work with big stars, because they are just like ordinary people. When we practiced dancing, we always had to go to the gymnasium. Sometimes if there were teams of dancers practicing steps there, and there wasn't much space left, then we would go to a stage that wasn't being used. Mom often accompanied me, sitting on the side watching. Sometimes I would glance at her, and she would smile slightly. Sometimes if I missed a step, she would just shake her head with a chuckle. If I was dancing happily and didn't want to rest, she would scold me because she was afraid I was too tired; but I still wouldn't stop unless Jamie Dunn told me to stop, and then I would obey. Every time I practiced singing, dancing, or performing before filming a new film, or when the official filming started, Mom was always watching from the side. I really needed her like that and didn't want her to leave even a step, and I felt that I could do it boldly. If she wasn't by my side, I would feel very lonely and almost burst into tears.

In this film "Stand Up and Cheer," there were many important stars, such as Warner Baxter, John Boles, Madge Evans, Jamie Dunn, and many beautiful chorus girls, and boys and girls of the same age as me, so people didn't pay much attention to me, unlike now when everyone pays attention to me. But later, when this film was screened in the small cinema of the photography studio, Mr. Sheehan took one look and couldn't help but blurt out, "Oh, that little girl stole the film!" Ke Gan, this sentence doesn't mean that I really stole the film. He meant that they didn't value this small role at first, but unexpectedly, I was the best performer in the whole film.

Entertainment World

### Sai Jiabao Has a Big Mouth

— Hua Zhi

Generally, when an artist enters show business, it's like a politician ascending to power; there must be a moving speech. If one remains silent, it proves they lack charisma and have no power to rally support. Recently, RKO Pictures in Hollywood, to expand its cast and select talent, specially hired Swedish actress Signe Hasso, known as the "Second Greta Garbo." Hasso graduated from the Royal Dramatic Training Academy in Sweden, which is like the "Ke Ban" (Peking Opera School) of Europe. She gained fame on stage early in her career. Her husband is a director, and her face resembles Garbo, naturally drawing attention.

Upon taking her post, Hasso spoke of her plans in film with great confidence. She said, "Many believe that in these chaotic times, the entertainment industry can be put aside. This is a very narrow view. In my opinion, in this era of war, artists like us have a significant responsibility because entertainment is not just for amusement; it can promote national spirit and boost morale. I have three conditions for going to Hollywood: (1) I will not act in unconscious films, such as pornographic films, and I reserve the right to modify scripts; (2) The male actors who co-star with me will only be Charles Boyer and James Stewart; (3) I will only work nine months each year, returning to my home country for the other three months to adjust my personal life."

### Li Qinian Stars in Modern Drama

— Hai Ou

"Southern Beauty" Already Filming

Since arriving in Shanghai, "Southern Film Queen" Miss Li Qinian has been very popular with audiences. In the two and a half months she has been in Shanghai, she has completed two historical dramas, "Empress" and "Liang Hongyu." Initially, Li Qinian's contract with Yi Hua stipulated filming modern dramas, so both parties are preparing to fulfill the promise of shooting modern plays.

Li Qinian's performance in modern dramas allows for a greater display of her acting skills. Although she has not acted in Mandarin modern dramas, her performances in Cantonese modern dramas have been exceptionally successful.

Experienced directors say that Li Qinian is best suited for modern dramas. Yi Hua also understands her strengths and plans to make extensive use of her. Therefore, the screenwriting department has been brainstorming to prepare a large number of modern drama scripts for Li Qinian.

Among these scripts is one called "Southern Beauty," a tragedy that satirizes society, which suits Li Qinian's personality in many ways. The story is about a Hong Kong socialite who was once very popular in the South, but later came to Shanghai and suffered from the dark forces of society. A small part of it is similar to "Little Thing" in "Sunrise," but "Southern Beauty" is more realistic and vivid.

"Southern Beauty" is now being filmed at the Yi Hua studio, and Li Qinian's performance certainly lives up to expectations. It is said that a certain theater, due to changing to showing domestic films, has commissioned someone to negotiate with Yi Hua for the first-run screening rights, indicating that modern dramas are beginning to gain momentum.

### Shu Shi Dislikes Film Life

Shu Shi told a Hai Xing News reporter: "From today onwards, I will no longer make movies." When asked why, he replied, "I feel it's meaningless. My family originally did not support my joining the film industry. My purpose was not to earn a few dollars, but to really act. Now I feel there is no interest, so I plan to complete the two years of law school and perhaps become a lawyer in the future." The reporter asked about the contract, and he replied: "The contract started on September 1st of last year and ends at the end of August of this year. It has already expired." When asked if he was dissatisfied with his treatment, he replied: "With a clear conscience, the company has treated me well, and the remuneration is also quite considerable. I said long ago that my family can still afford to eat. My purpose is not to make a living from this, but to act, to act in a few plays that I can do happily. Now I have no intention of staying in the film industry." When Shu Shi spoke, his intention seemed quite firm. It is said that Shu Shi joined the Green Bird Drama Society after the war and then joined the film industry. Although his history is quite short, his acting skills are not bad, and he has become one of the top leading men after the war. If he withdraws from the film industry, it would be a pity.

Hawthorne Case

### The Final Destination of the Dance Queen

— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter 8: Two People Captured

When I followed Hawthorne, leaving Ya Dong and getting into his car, I felt an indescribable joy and relief. Because this case was developing step by step, successively netting three suspects—Yu Gantang, Lu Jiansheng, and Zhao Boxiong—this mysterious case could finally come to a conclusion; especially the arrest of Zhao Boxiong gave me hope that the case would end immediately, because among these three, he was the most suspicious and violent. The fact that he had shot at Hawthorne was also obvious evidence. Unexpectedly, my triumphant mood did not receive any confirmation from Hawthorne. After he started the car, his face was very calm, his hands gripped the steering wheel, his eyes fixed on the road ahead, and the muscles on his face were tense. I examined him carefully but could not find a trace of relief in his heart. I couldn't help but be surprised, because his expression was completely contrary to my expectations.

Once, I couldn't help but ask, "Hawthorne, what do you think of this case? Isn't it about to end?"

"Far from it." His gaze remained fixed on the road ahead, and his voice was cold.

I said in surprise, "Far from it? What do you mean? Isn't this person the main culprit?" Seeing him looking at the dashboard without answering, as if he hadn't heard, I asked again, "Then, did you find anything in 556?"

He replied curtly, "Nothing. Don't say too much; it's not easy to drive right now."

The driving he was referring to was, of course, the car. It was lunchtime—the time for writing letters—and the streets were indeed flowing with traffic. He forbade me to speak, as if on the grounds that talking too much would distract him and cause an accident. In fact, I felt this was clearly an excuse. His driving skills are excellent. He can drive and chat in noisy areas. I have experienced this many times. Now he is using this reason to prevent me from asking questions, which I cannot hide from. Strange, now that the case is progressing smoothly, why does Hawthorne seem even more serious and tense? (121)
