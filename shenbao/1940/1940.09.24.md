### Vietnam Accepts Japanese Demands to Conclude Agreement; Japanese Troops Invade Vietnam and Begin Advancing North; France Claims to Grant Military Convenience to Japan to Resolve the War Against China; 200,000 Chinese Troops Concentrated in Yunnan and Guangxi, Preparing to Resist Japanese Invasion

China's Foreign Ministry Lodges Strong Protest to France

Tokyo – This morning at 11:00 AM, the Japanese Army and Navy Headquarters announced that Japanese army and navy troops began peacefully advancing north through Vietnam today. It is heard that some disputes had occurred in several sections, but it is now believed that they can be resolved immediately. (Reuters, 23rd)

Vichy – The French government has just issued a public statement saying that all kinds of conveniences have now been granted to the Japanese in terms of naval and land forces in the Vietnam region, so that the Japanese can continue to engage in building a "New Order in East Asia" and resolving the war against China. The statement continued that the Japanese had assured the French government that they would respect France's rights in the Far East, allow the territorial integrity of Vietnam, and the rights of the French in all parts of Vietnam. The French government has now decided to allow the Japanese government all kinds of special conveniences in the Vietnam region, so that Japanese naval and land forces can continue to fight. The French and Japanese military authorities in Hanoi have unanimously agreed on granting various naval conveniences to Japan in order to build a new order in East Asia and resolve the Chinese war. Henry, the French ambassador to Japan, and Matsuoka, the Japanese foreign minister, were in Tokyo last week discussing various fundamental issues in a spirit of friendship. (United Press, 23rd)

Hanoi – An announcement issued by the French side yesterday afternoon stated that a foundation for "New Friendly Cooperation between Japan and Vietnam in the Far East" had been established. The announcement stated that the "guarantee" given to Vietnam by Japan was exchanged for the French authorities granting Japan certain military conveniences, "no longer imposing restrictions on the Japanese army." French officials indicated that the terms of the agreement signed yesterday had "slightly changed" from the original Japanese demands in last weekend's ultimatum. They recalled that the French side had found some of the original Japanese demands "unacceptable." Reliable sources said that the agreement taking effect included the following key points: (1) Japan can send 6,000 troops to be stationed in Vietnam, and these troops will enter through Haiphong. (2) Japan can use three airfields in Tokyo for military purposes. These airfields include Fuji (transliteration) and Lao Kai or Flandong (transliteration) and the air force base of Kiaram (transliteration). As for the rumored agreement that Japan obtained certain rights on the French railway, nothing was heard last night. Special correspondent, Jacko Pei (transliteration). (United Press, 23rd)

Hanoi – Vietnamese authorities and Japanese representatives restarted negotiations on the 21st and continued on the 22nd, immediately signing an agreement whereby Japan provides guarantees to Vietnam, and the Vietnamese authorities granted the Japanese army certain military conveniences, thereby supplementing the principled agreement previously reached between France and Japan in Tokyo, and laying a new foundation for friendly cooperation between Japan and Vietnam in the Far East. (Havas, 23rd)

Chongqing – Regarding the matter of Japanese troops requesting to pass through Vietnam, the Chinese government has repeatedly expressed its serious attitude and has called the attention of the Vichy and Vietnamese authorities. According to reliable information, Vietnam signed an agreement with Japanese representatives at 3:00 PM on September 22, allowing Japanese troops to use Vietnamese territory. On the 23rd, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs lodged the most serious protest to the French side. In addition to the free exercise of China's right to self-defense, which Chongqing has repeatedly made clear, it also declared that the French side should be fully responsible for the losses and effects resulting from this. (Telegraph, 13th)

Chongqing – A Chinese spokesman commented on France's "agreement with Vietnam," saying that China had ample time to prepare for this outcome and that "our actions will proceed smoothly according to a pre-determined plan." The number of Chinese troops currently concentrated in the two provinces of Yunnan and Guangxi near the Vietnamese border has not been announced, but it is estimated that 200,000 troops are deployed in the Guangxi and Yunnan areas, preparing to resist the Japanese advance on Kunming. He Yingqin, the Minister of Military Administration, recently flew to the border twice to complete the final preparations. It is generally believed that the Chinese army will not launch an all-out offensive into Vietnam, but it is possible that it will send teams across the border to occupy militarily important positions in the mountains as an outer perimeter of defense. Large-scale destruction of all transportation facilities on the border is currently underway. The entire section of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway within Chinese territory has been moved elsewhere. The evacuation of Kunming residents and government agencies is now being stepped up, for fear that Japan may soon launch a fierce bombardment of Kunming from its newly acquired air base in Tokyo. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement tonight reviewing developments in Vietnam and tracing the Chinese government's attitude towards the matter at various stages of the Franco-Japanese negotiations, from the start of the negotiations to Japan's ultimatum to Vietnam. The Chinese people here are not surprised by the news of the Franco-Japanese agreement, because although foreign news repeatedly reported that the Vietnamese authorities had adopted a firm stance and rejected Japanese demands, they always believed that the French side would eventually yield. The most important issue in the minds of the Chinese people at present is what the second step will be after Japan obtains an air base in Vietnam and troops land and pass through the country. It is said that there are only two possibilities: (1) Invade Yunnan Province in an attempt to seize Kunming, China's major southwestern transportation hub. (2) Japan will consolidate its position in Vietnam and wait for an opportunity to subsequently invade the Dutch East Indies and Singapore. According to well-informed Chinese and foreign observers, there are still doubts about whether Japan will attempt to attack Kunming. (Reuters, 23rd)

Chongqing – Chinese authorities here said this afternoon that the Japanese invasion of Vietnam was merely an indispensable threat adopted by Japan after issuing an ultimatum to the French authorities in Vietnam yesterday. A spokesman said that Japan's recent actions prove that the demand put forward by Japan to pass through Vietnam was merely a pretext to fool the world. "If Japan attacks Vietnam from Chinese territory, why does it need to ask to pass through Vietnam to attack China?" Chinese officials said that they regret that the Vietnamese authorities succumbed and accepted Japan's demands. Although the contents of the Franco-Japanese agreement have not yet been fully published, Chinese officials believe that the scope of the agreement must far exceed the needs of Japanese troops passing through the country. A spokesman said that this agreement will allow Japanese troops to be stationed permanently in Vietnam, and there is no doubt that after this agreement is signed, the first to be sacrificed by Japan's aggression will be Vietnam, not China. Chinese military authorities said that China has made full military preparations on the border. An army spokesman said, "If Japan attacks Yunnan from Vietnam, it will encounter unprecedented failure." However, an official said that third countries with major interests in the Pacific should know that Japan's occupation of Vietnam is a prelude to its attempt to control the entire Southwest Pacific. (International News Service, 23rd)

Hong Kong – According to French sources here this morning, Japanese troops will begin landing their first batch of troops on Sunday afternoon and evening according to the terms of the new agreement, but the message did not specify the location of the Japanese troops' landing. The details of the agreement signed yesterday afternoon are not yet known, but it is known that the French authorities have allowed some Japanese troops to pass through Vietnam and establish several Japanese airfields. According to the new agreement, it is still unclear whether Japanese troops can use the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway. The Vietnamese French authorities said that there was a Franco-Japanese conflict last night. (International News Service, 23rd)

Tokyo – Foreign Ministry spokesman Suma, when meeting with news reporters today to discuss the Vietnamese Franco-Japanese agreement, declared that Japan has no plans to occupy land in French Indochina. The current Franco-Japanese agreement is based on peaceful talks between the two countries, and no foreign country should have any objection to this. Japan has maintained a patient attitude during the negotiations. Although local conflicts occurred on the border last night, this was entirely due to a misunderstanding by the French authorities in Vietnam. This resolution agreement was initially discussed with the French ambassador to Japan in August of this year, with the aim of resolving the China Incident as soon as possible and contributing to the new order in East Asia. Foreign Minister Matsuoka discussed the fundamental issues concerning Vietnam with the French ambassador in August, and France therefore agreed to grant Japan various military conveniences needed by the army and navy in Vietnam to resolve the China Incident. Later, basic negotiations were conducted in Hanoi, and specific plans were decided with the French military authorities. As a result, a detailed agreement was signed there yesterday afternoon on the 22nd. Japanese troops, in accordance with the agreement, began entering Vietnam from the northern border on the morning of the 23rd. Therefore, the border conflict may have been caused by the French authorities issuing orders to the French troops in the area, and the transmission was delayed. We believe that after this order is transmitted to the French army, the border incident can be quickly resolved. According to the contents of the Franco-Japanese agreement, Tokyo has not yet released it. (Reuters, 23rd)

Tokyo – The Foreign Ministry repeatedly stated today that the Japanese anti-British and American agreement authorizes the United States Navy to use the Singapore base, and its intention is obviously to fear US retaliation for Japan's invasion of Vietnam. According to Foreign Ministry spokesman Suma's statement to reporters today, "We believe that the current situation does not allow such actions. Since the British and American agreement has not taken into account Japanese interests, it is difficult to take effect." Suma also said, "The Hanoi Conference reached an agreement yesterday. According to the terms, the French authorities should allow all Japanese military actions that can be used to resolve the China Incident. The conflict between Japanese and French troops when the Japanese army invaded Vietnam last Sunday night was caused by the French side's failure to immediately notify the local French army of the Hanoi agreement. We have no territorial ambitions for Vietnam, nor do we deliberately incite incidents. What we are hoping for is the peaceful implementation of the Hanoi agreement. Since this agreement was reached through peaceful consultations, other countries should have no objection." However, according to neutral observers here, the establishment of the Hanoi agreement was caused by Japanese threats. The United Kingdom and the United States may take further objections to Japan. The so-called further objection is that the United States accepts the British proposal to use the Singapore naval base. (United Press, 23rd)

The Franco-Japanese Conflict in Đồng Đăng Ceases; Rumor that French Troops Have Been Disarmed

Tokyo – The Japanese Army Headquarters has just stated that the French troops disarmed by the Japanese army are the troops who resisted the Japanese army's entry into Vietnam last night. After the French troops in Đồng Đăng were disarmed, the military actions of the French and Japanese troops on the border have ceased. (United Press, 23rd)

Haiphong – The Franco-Japanese sides have signed an agreement, and the war has stopped. (Reuters, 23rd)

Haiphong – At 10:00 PM last night, the Japanese army in South China invaded Vietnam before the expiration of the 72-hour ultimatum issued on the 20th of this month, encountering strong resistance from the French side, and stopped the attack at midnight, but it is expected that the attack will be re-launched this morning. (Reuters, 23rd)

Haiphong – Less than 24 hours after the Franco-Japanese agreement was signed in Hanoi yesterday, when Japan's ultimatum was about to expire, Japanese troops suddenly crossed the border from South China today and landed from Japanese warships in Haiphong, and entered Vietnam one after another. Due to a "misunderstanding," French and Japanese troops clashed in Đồng Đăng, a place on the northern border of Vietnam, and fired at each other. Both sides suffered casualties. Several French and Japanese soldiers were killed. It is currently unclear why this conflict occurred. According to French sources, the Japanese advance was large and they did not know that the Western powers had already negotiated an agreement. On the other hand, the Japanese claimed that the Japanese army was only crossing the border in accordance with the terms of the negotiated agreement, and the French army, unaware that an agreement had been signed, "illegally" attempted to resist.

### After the Signing of the Vietnam Agreement

The agreement was signed by Japanese representative Nishihara and French Indochina Governor-General Decoux at 3:00 PM yesterday, the 22nd of this month.

Vietnam has long had more than 200 Japanese residents, mostly small businessmen. There were no unresolved disputes between Vietnam and Japan, and it could be called a non-issue. The so-called issue only began after Japan made demands on France, hoping that the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway would stop transporting wartime supplies to China. In France's view, concession can achieve complete preservation, compromise can resolve disputes, it is not difficult to dry one's face after being spat on, and accepting requests is not a problem. Great things can be turned into small things, and small things can be turned into nothing, and the problem will disappear. In Japan's view, weakness is an object of aggression, and gaining an inch is a ladder to a foot. Not only do they create something out of nothing, but they can also turn anything they pick up into a problem, and even more so into a grand article. Therefore, after the cessation of transportation on the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, there were endless acts of blackmail and fierce appearances, and the agreement was finally concluded yesterday. The terms of the agreement are recorded in today's news column, so there is no need to introduce them here. In France, it is said that "the sincere cooperation between Vietnam and Japan can thereby lay a foundation," and also that "it is reasonable and consistent with the permanent interests of Vietnam to establish friendly relations with sincerity and mutual respect." The person making this statement is Governor-General Decoux of Vietnam, a military man who has always had a reputation for being generous and brave, and Decoux is a general of the French army. In Japan, they agree to recognize "the integrity of Vietnam and France's sovereignty in Vietnam." This statement can be believed by anyone in Japan, and anyone in the world would like to respond with a knowing smile. Here, we do not need to add any interpretation or further expose it. The world should be able to understand whose world Vietnam will be in the future.

Since September 18, 1931, Japan began its various offensives against foreign countries, and it has been more than nine years since then. They have exhausted the full strength of their three armies and the wealth of their officials and people, and they have been fighting hard for more than a year. In terms of legal principles, the only thing that can be called a harvest is this Vietnam agreement. The richness of the harvest is probably no greater than this Vietnam agreement. France was defeated by Germany, a military defeat; and yielded to Italy, a surrender of power. Germany and Italy, using their national and popular fate as a gamble, signed a ceasefire agreement with France; everything else, beyond this, is unknown. Of course, the lords of Vichy may not necessarily be more generous to Japan than to Germany and Italy, and Germany and Italy may not necessarily only engage in taking chestnuts out of the fire to feed Japan. In the end, is what Japan has gained a sweet and plump roasted chestnut that can be safely digested, or a bomb containing a buried fuse? This single Vietnam agreement may not be able to guarantee it for eternity.

There are at least two possibilities for things that are not necessarily so. What will the relationship between France and Germany and Italy ultimately be like? The future is complicated and confusing, so let's put it aside for now. Discussing the Vietnam issue, there are also matters related to Germany and Italy: First, according to speculation from all sides, as well as informal revelations from the Japanese side, it is said that Germany and Italy have actually suppressed France and spoken for Japan in Japan's taking of Vietnam. There are several reasons to believe this statement. However, given the deceitfulness of international relations, while Germany and Italy have never formally expressed anything regarding the Vietnam issue from beginning to end, even if there are reasons to believe it, we should still reserve plenty of room for doubt. The main excuse Japan used to blackmail Vietnam was to obtain military convenience for invading China. Although Germany has given Japan a pleasant appearance in many aspects, it has never sacrificed the good friendship between China and Germany within the scope of Japan's invasion of China, and given Japan any encouragement. Therefore, we are still unwilling to easily believe that Germany has made a clear abandonment of Sino-German friendship for this resolution of Japanese action. At the same time, starting from the friendship between China and Germany, we should also wait quietly for Germany to make a clear statement as proof. Second, assuming that Germany and Italy did indeed support Japan in its coercion of French Indochina, then there must be considerable conditions attached between Germany and Italy and Japan. There is no need to ask about the content of the conditions, but it is a common international practice to forget the means after achieving the goal and to violate faith and betray righteousness. After Japan obtains the Vietnam agreement, will it take actions to fulfill the conditions? Will it be genuine or will it only appear to fulfill them? Will it have the strength to do so? If not, will Japan's gaining of Vietnam by relying on Germany and Italy disappoint Germany and Italy by being deceived and give the Vietnam agreement some kind of impact? These are all possibilities, not necessities.

Opening up the ring of Germany and Italy to discuss the Vietnam agreement, China declared in advance that for the sake of self-defense, China cannot sit idly by and watch France abandon its status as a third country in the Sino-Japanese War, giving China a disadvantage and giving the other side convenience. Although it is impossible to predict what actions China will take after France and Japan sign the agreement and Japanese troops land in Vietnam, it can be asserted that China has the greatest possibility of taking any important action. Only in this way, more due to geographical and historical reasons, and the emotional and interest relations between the French, Vietnamese, and overseas Chinese, can powerful and effective military strategic actions be taken to give the written agreement a factual impact. This is something to pay attention to in the future, first. The United Kingdom has Burma and the Malay Peninsula, the base of the Singapore naval port, which borders Vietnam. Although Japan's plot in Vietnam is said to be against China, it is aimed at the United Kingdom. The gains and losses and the waxing and waning of power in this are the foundations and keys of the British Empire in the East, and the relationship with Hong Kong, a small island, cannot be compared to one ten-thousandth of its importance. As evidence, in the midst of the United Kingdom's busy resistance to Germany, and at a time when it was eager to maintain its only remaining friendship with Japan, it still protested to Japan before the signing of the Vietnam agreement, on the basis of its legally only third-country status. It can be seen that the United Kingdom has been able to confirm that the situation in Vietnam is directly and acutely related to the United Kingdom. Now that the Vietnam agreement has been signed, France has yielded again and again, and Japan's sword is on the brink. Is it said that the United Kingdom will instead be silent and rest? Is it said that the United Kingdom's protest is equal to officialdom, simply doing its best without regard to practical results? Churchill is not Chamberlain, and the two eras are quite different. This is not a minor disease, but the calamity of dismemberment. So what will the United Kingdom do? Even if it does not take any powerful and effective action, but only follows it with high-sounding self-deprecation, how much effort will its wording have to take to become an international wonder? This is something to pay attention to in the future, second. As for the United States, in the two or three months since Vietnam became an issue, it has repeatedly expressed its determination to maintain the status quo, and has never relaxed in the slightest until the eve of the signing of the Vietnam agreement. The reason for this is not only to reveal its sympathy for the weak France, but also because the situation in Vietnam is related to the safety of the Philippines, to the fate of the United Kingdom, and to the future of the Far East and the Pacific, which is both far-reaching and profound. Borrowing the example of Singapore and Hong Kong is undoubtedly an important strategic layout. However, what is the point of just laying out? How can it contain the rampant and mitigate the crisis? The United States has a firm and strong national policy, which we know well. We deeply believe that all its actions have great power and inevitable effects. However, as things stand today, signing the agreement and landing are mocking the United States one by one. There is no question that the United States will definitely take action, and that its actions will definitely affect the Vietnam agreement. The question is how to act? When to act? This is something to pay attention to in the future, third. The world situation is in the midst of a fierce battle between light and darkness, and the development of darkness is wider and faster, and it is getting more and more intense. Since the signing of the Vietnam agreement and the landing of Japanese troops in Vietnam, it has been an important hub for the extension and expansion of the struggle. The Soviet Union is a key player in the overall situation, and all dark forces, no matter what color they are currently dyed or what smoke they are spreading, their nature is ultimately the extreme anti-Soviet camp. Is it said that the Soviet Union will still remain outside the situation and sit idly by and watch it expand? If not, how will it coordinate with the United States and how will it vigorously assist China? The left and right must be supported. How can this be delayed? This is something to pay attention to in the future, fourth. The Vietnam agreement does not add or subtract to the opposing forces of China and Japan. Therefore, Vietnam's being controlled by the Japanese army is by no means another aspect of China being invaded, but rather another nest of disaster in the world. The time for final reckoning has arrived. Is the great light in sight?

Decoux issued a declaration today stating that the Franco-Japanese conclusion of the agreement stipulates the details of what was agreed upon by the Japanese government and the French ambassador in Tokyo. The contents of the agreement were not disclosed in the declaration: (1) To allow the Japanese side to establish three air force bases in Tokyo and have the right to station 5,000 troops to monitor them. (2) The Japanese army has the right to pass through Vietnam from Huainan along a designated route. (3) To allow some Japanese troops to land and station in Haiphong. The first news of the Japanese army invading the border and the French army resisting was published in a French communiqué at midnight, and at the same time, it was said that Nishihara and his entourage had gone to the airfield. It was generally believed that the flames of war would break out from then on. Later, it was learned that the reason why Nishihara and his entourage went to the airfield was only to give the last order to a special envoy, instructing him to fly to the border and deliver it to the commander of the Japanese army. The official French communiqué on the war in Dong Dang only said that the Japanese army crossed the border and the French army resisted with force. As for the details, it is not yet known. It is expected that this matter will soon become clear. It is generally believed that the Vietnamese and Japanese sides will jointly issue a communiqué on this matter today. (Reuters, 23rd)

### Governor of Vietnam Tells People to Acknowledge the Foundation of Franco-Japanese Cooperation Established

Hanoi – Governor-General of Vietnam, Vice Admiral Decoux, has just issued a letter to the people, roughly saying that difficult negotiations have now come to an end. As the head of Vietnam, I should give an objective explanation of the current situation and call on the people to maintain calm, abide by discipline, and uphold a spirit of understanding. The governments of France and Japan have formed a diplomatic agreement stipulating that Japan clearly recognizes Vietnam's territorial integrity and France's central rights in Vietnam. In France, it is out of a spirit of friendly assistance to give the Japanese army certain military conveniences in Vietnam as an exchange condition. Later, the Vietnamese authorities began talks with Japanese representatives to formulate implementation methods for the above agreement. The talks have been going on for several weeks. The Vietnamese commander-in-chief and Commander Martin of the Vietnamese garrison have carefully reviewed the implementation conditions, taking great pains to ensure that they are beneficial to both parties and can truly be regarded as the initial expression of lasting friendship between France and Japan. Based on this purpose, in the northern region, there will be several airfields for the Japanese army to use to meet the needs of its military operations. No greater confidence can be shown by one country to another. The sincere cooperation between Vietnam and Japan can thereby lay a foundation. Our Vietnam and the Japanese Empire are close at hand. It is reasonable and consistent with the permanent interests of Vietnam to establish friendly relations with sincerity and mutual respect. The agreement signed by both parties recently is intended to adapt to this pragmatic policy, and the Vietnamese people will definitely understand its purpose, which I firmly believe. I have fully fulfilled my duties as the head of Vietnam, and I hope that the people can also do their best, accept the new situation without any other intentions, so that the new situation can enable Vietnam to work in peace and thereby move forward on the path of destiny. For the present, French and Vietnamese should unite under the guidance of their leaders with the spirit of discipline, work, and patriotism. This is the urgent task that cannot be delayed. (Havas, 23rd)

### U.S. Declines to Comment Before Receiving Official Report

Vichy, French officials declared here last night that a Franco-Japanese agreement regarding Vietnam had been established. The statement was made before receiving news that Japanese troops had crossed the Annam border last night. Recently, French newspapers here published lengthy commentaries on the statement made by U.S. Secretary of State Hull regarding Vietnam. The French newspapers analyzed that the U.S. had not provided concrete assistance to Vietnam, and therefore France might be forced to accept Japan's demands. The Petit Parisien reported that some American telegrams indicated that the U.S. would oppose Japanese troops landing in Vietnam, but such statements were not officially verified. Washington's insistence that Japan respect the status quo in Vietnam is, of course, a given. However, one might ask whether this attitude can translate into concrete action. Given the current state of U.S. military expansion, this is still doubtful. Moral protests are insufficient to deter the dynamism of Japan's new Konoe cabinet. Therefore, we can only rely on our own strength and negotiation to escape this dangerous situation with minimal losses. (United Press, 23rd)

Washington, the news of Japanese troops entering Annam, published in newspapers this morning, has caused great unease in Washington. The White House has not yet received an official report confirming the news, and therefore has not issued any opinions. However, the general opinion in Washington is that the U.S. is now facing a situation that requires decisive action. Given the U.S.'s publicly stated policy of maintaining the status quo in the Far East, it is believed here that the U.S. will not tolerate the existence of this new situation. Whether the U.S. government's reaction to this matter will be limited to lodging a protest with Japan, or whether it will take more severe measures, depends on President Roosevelt's decision. Sources close to the State Department claimed that since the outbreak of the war, the U.S. has considered the Annam issue to be an extremely serious problem in the Far East. To uphold the U.S.'s commitment to maintaining the status quo in the Far East, it has been decided to station the U.S. fleet in Honolulu. (Haitong News Agency, 3rd)

Tokyo, today's news: U.S. Ambassador Grew visited Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka on Saturday for a 90-minute meeting. The topic of discussion is unknown. The U.S. Ambassador and Matsuoka also held a meeting on Friday evening. Political circles believe that the main topic of conversation must have been the situation in Vietnam. (United Press, 23rd)

Washington, the State Department today refused to criticize the Franco-Japanese agreement allowing Japanese troops to enter Vietnam. According to the State Department, it does not intend to comment before receiving official reports regarding the situation in Vietnam. (United Press, 23rd)

### Italian Authority Spokesman Will Support Japanese Occupation of Vietnam

Rome, a responsible official of the Fascist Party recently stated that the Italian government may support the Japanese occupation of Vietnam. An authoritative spokesperson stated that, given the friendly relations between Italy and Japan, Italy will support Japan's actions in Vietnam's situation. (United Press, 23rd)

Hong Kong, knowledgeable sources here revealed that Germany and Japan had reached a compromise on the Vietnam issue at some point in the past. Therefore, Japan's attitude in recent negotiations has been tough, culminating yesterday. It was also stated that Germany agreed to Japan sending troops to a limited area within Vietnam, provided that Japan guarantees no intention of occupying Vietnam. Germany does not object to Japan obtaining concessions for rice, salt, coal, and other minerals. (United Press, 23rd)

### German Air Force Continues to Attack London Area, Uses "New Weapons" Extensively, Sulfur Bombs Shine Brightly, Anti-Aircraft Fire Unprecedentedly Intense

London, as British searchlights and anti-aircraft batteries fully cooperated according to new defense methods last night and this morning, the activities of German raiders became tense again. Bombs were scattered throughout London, and a mysterious sulfurous yellow light was used, which the British call "new German weapons." Violent anti-aircraft fire and bomb explosions were heard throughout the area. Bombings and gunfire were particularly intense in the southwest and northwest. The first wave of air raids occurred in the darkness. However, as German planes appeared and disappeared in the clouds, performing a game of hide-and-seek, the searchlights were also unusually active. Continuous anti-aircraft fire formed a shimmering light in the sky. German planes, either individually or in groups of two or three, circled over London, occasionally hiding in the clouds to avoid anti-aircraft fire, but the anti-aircraft guns continued to fire at them. The searchlights closely followed the groups of German planes, and the anti-aircraft fire was frantically directed at the illuminated sky. Fires were started in the southwest district due to bombings, but the fires were soon brought under control. Countless houses and shops were destroyed in the northwest area. A house with many residents was also damaged when a bomb landed near a building, but no one was injured as the residents had taken refuge in air-raid shelters. The first air-raid alert was lifted earlier than usual, but the residents of London remained in their basements, not being fooled. A second air raid occurred immediately. Only a few minutes after the alert was issued, bombs and gunfire were active in central London. Three bombs landed in London, one of which caused a gas pipe to rupture and ignite, creating an explosion that sounded like an express train passing through a tunnel. This was followed by bombing by a few planes until dawn. (United Press, 23rd)

London, yesterday, the English Channel was hit by storms and rain. The British coastal defense forces were able to rest a little because there was less German aircraft activity. However, the German long-range artillery continued to shell the British Isles across the sea all day in the rain. The shells all landed in the southeast. It is reported that German aircraft also visited the area. London's artillery fired continuously last night. Many German planes failed to break through the fire net and were forced to flee before reaching their targets. The German planes that attacked at night came rolling in from the northwest after being driven back for two consecutive days. (International, 23rd)

London, German air force bombing of London intensified today. Within the first hour and a half of the initial air raid, the intensity was not very severe, but it became more intense later. After midnight, anti-aircraft batteries throughout the London area opened fire, launching a major counterattack against German planes. According to the semi-official News Association last night, the Germans "seem to be using a secret weapon." The association stated, "For several consecutive times, a yellow sulfurous light illuminated the sky for up to two seconds. This light lasted longer than the flash of a bomb explosion, but was not as long-lasting as a real flame." German bombers flew in groups of three, four, five, or six all over the London area, presumably to avoid the powerful anti-aircraft fire. German planes dropped "Molotov bread baskets" in several places in the city. The intensity of London's anti-aircraft fire later became like throwing a real steel curtain into the sky. During the second air raid alert in London yesterday, there was a fierce battle over the northern suburbs. During the first air raid yesterday afternoon, four bombs hit southeast London. On Saturday night, a hospital in central London was hit. The bomb went through the roof of the church, but no one was injured. In addition, other villages in southeastern England were also attacked, but the damage was minimal. (United Press, 23rd)

London, last night, German planes flew to London and dropped bombs on the southeast area, killing and injuring seven people. Many houses and shops were damaged. The bombs dropped by the German planes mostly landed in areas that had already been attacked and damaged. Also, a German plane flew to northwest London, broke through the dense clouds, and dived to drop a batch of high-explosive bombs, destroying several houses and shops. The enemy planes that attacked last night seemed to be hiding above the clouds. The anti-aircraft guns bombed the clouds, and the enemy planes dispersed and fled. The artillery fire continued to bombard them. The Ministry of Aviation and the Ministry of Home Security issued a public statement on the activities of the German air force yesterday, stating that the German side did not have large-scale activities. There were occasional single planes flying over the eastern and northeastern coasts. Some intruded into the mainland over East Anglia, and a few reached the London countryside and southeastern London. Bombs were dropped, hitting several houses, and gas and water pipes were slightly damaged. It is heard that there were slight casualties. It is heard that two churches were slightly damaged and a hospital was also damaged. However, none of the people and patients in the hospital were injured. It is reported that at least twenty small fires broke out in northwest London, but they were extinguished before they spread. It is heard that a total of four German planes were lost yesterday, falling into the sea near Gottawyn Sands in North Wales, the Sussex coast and London. (Reuters, 23rd)

### British Planes Bomb Berlin, German Channel Base Continues to Be Bombed

Berlin, tonight Berlin encountered the first British air raid in a week. People in Berlin rushed to air-raid shelters. The air raid alert lasted for two and a half hours. German heavy anti-aircraft fire prevented British planes from flying into the center of Berlin. A German communiqué stated that three British bomber formations had penetrated northern Germany via the Netherlands. It is claimed that several British planes reached Brandenburg, where they encountered the outer perimeter of the Berlin defense line. German official sources also stated that the British planes fled without dropping bombs. (International, 23rd)

London, at the end of the week, the British Air Force resumed its terrible bombing of the Channel ports, namely, Hitler's base for the invasion of England, causing significant damage to ships, docks, and ports. According to an Aviation Ministry statement, from dusk on Saturday to nearly dawn on Sunday, the ports of Ostend, Dunkirk, Boulogne, and Calais were heavily bombed by British bombers. Many ships and docks were hit by bombs, exploding and catching fire. All the British planes returned safely.

British coastal aircraft also attacked German ships at sea and were quite successful. Near Boulogne, a convoy of 12 merchant ships was bombed, and south of Bergen, a large supply ship was bombed with incendiary bombs by a patrolling British plane. British planes also attacked two smaller ships near the Dutch island of Ameland, one of which was hit and exploded. (Reuters, 23rd)

### Circumstances of the British Children's Ship Disaster: 90 Children, Only 7 Escaped

London, today the first news was disclosed that on the 17th of this month, a German submarine in the Atlantic torpedoed a British children's evacuation ship. The number of deaths may be no less than 294. Of the 90 children on board, 83 also died. These children boarded the ship at a port on the west coast in the second week of this month to reside temporarily in Canada. The ship was hit by a torpedo at 10:00 PM on the 17th. Seven of the nine escorts also died. Seven surviving children have been taken to a port in northern England by a warship. It was found that the ship had very comprehensive precautions. Every 15 evacuated children had experienced escorts, doctors and nurses each to take care of. However, the situation when the tragedy occurred made all kinds of precautions fail. When the torpedo exploded, several children were killed. In addition, the treacherous sea waves overturned many lifeboats, making rescue impossible. When the warship carrying the endangered children sailed back, the governor of the autonomous territory, Salisbury, greeted them and said, "It is shocking and infuriating that a German submarine torpedoed a ship 600 miles from land in a treacherous sea. Under the circumstances at the time, passengers on board, whether adults or children, had little chance of escaping. This action by the German side will surely shock the world. This is another example of Germany's barbaric methods of warfare, consistent with the barbaric bombing of women and children in London today." (Reuters, 23rd)

London, according to a male passenger on the British children's ship sunk by a German submarine, there was no warning before the German submarine attacked. The ship was hit by a torpedo, pierced through and capsized quite severely, sinking almost immediately, leaving only 20 minutes to unload the lifeboats. In addition, the darkness at sea increased the difficulty, and the turbulent waves almost swept us away. Then came rain and hail. The children behaved very calmly and obeyed orders. Two children died on the warship. Sonia, 11, and her 9-year-old brother, Terry, were among those rescued. Sonia said, "After we got on deck, we were ordered to go to the bow and enter the lifeboat. My sister had already gone down the ladder. My brother went down the rope. By the time he reached the sea, the boat had already rowed away, so he went back up. My brothers and I were then ordered to go to the stern. As we were running on the deck, we learned that the ship was sinking. We ran back to the bow and climbed down the rope into a small boat. Just as we were about to sit down, it was overturned by the wind and fell into the sea, and was picked up by another boat. Later, a warship was seen sailing over, and we cheered. Then we boarded the ship. Thank God for protecting us. My sister was already there. The sailors gave us wine, which was hard to drink, but because I drank it was beneficial, I swallowed it all at once." (Reuters, 23rd)

Washington, American people are very indignant at the news of the sinking of the British children's evacuation ship. Some members of Congress considered the matter to be "violence" and called Hitler "a mad butcher." All aspects of New York loathed Hitler's actions and expressed sympathy for the victims. According to news reports, the children were as calm as adults when the ship was sinking, and some sang songs and comforted the dying in the lifeboat. (Reuters, 23rd)

Ottawa, the brutal tactics of Germany sinking a ship full of British children in a storm-ridden ocean has caused great anger throughout Canada, and it is believed that this crime has solemnly demonstrated the conflict between the British Empire and Hitler's concepts. Senator Wilson, who most strongly advocated for British children to come to Canada, recently told a Reuters reporter that this matter made our determination to move children to a safe place even more firm.

### Egyptian Front, Italian Troops Advance Densely, Suffered Heavy Losses Due to British Artillery Fire, Italian Side Claims to Have Sunk a British Ship

Cairo, military news received here, Italian troops on the Egyptian front are adopting German tactics, advancing densely, rolling like waves, regardless of casualties, resulting in heavy casualties. At the same time, its transportation chain is long, making it more difficult to maintain the large army on the front line. However, the British army does not underestimate the combat effectiveness of the Italian army. When the Italian army advances in a dense formation, although it is a fixed target for British artillery fire, it fights bravely and shows no signs of shrinking. It is heard that the Italian army suffered heavy casualties when entering the village of Sidi Barrani, because the British army densely laid landmines in the village. When the Italian army invaded, it activated the control button, causing the landmines to explode. According to eyewitnesses, the landmines exploded after the enemy army entered the village, and the entire village was blown to pieces. The accuracy of the British artillery and its equipment and firing has proven to be superior to the Italian army. Now the British army is spirited and awaits the decisive battle, allowing the Italian army to slowly advance far behind the British army. At the same time, the British armored units are familiar with the terrain occupied by the Italian army, and use this point to bombard the Italian army and cause them trouble. (Reuters, 23rd)

Cairo, at the end of the week, Haifa was again attacked by Italian aircraft, which dropped bombs everywhere, killing 32 people and injuring 68 people, all of whom were Arabs. Several houses were damaged. A mosque and a Muslim cemetery were also among the damaged. All believed that the anti-aircraft fire had hit at least two Italian aircraft. Alexandria was also bombed, but the material damage was negligible and the casualties were very slight. (Reuters, 23rd)

Haifa, when Italian planes recently raided here, a large number of leaflets and bombs fell at the same time, declaring Mussolini's love for the Arab people. A total of 32 people were killed and 68 injured in this battle, all of whom were Arabs. (Reuters, 23rd)

Rome, the Italian Supreme Command announced today that the British air force in Egypt is now very panicked. Italian bombers are carrying out high-altitude bombings on British military targets without encountering any resistance. The Italian High Command announced tonight that the Italian aircraft attacked Mersa Matruh very successfully. As a result of the bombing there, a large fire has broken out. The British anti-aircraft guns fired at our planes with no effect, and the British air force was not seen to rise up to resist, but the Italian side admitted that the Italian concentration points in Sidi Barrani and Tobruk were bombed by British planes. (International, 23rd)

Rome, according to the Italian High Command, the British cruiser sunk on the 17th after being hit by a torpedo. Haifa was heavily damaged by Italian aircraft bombing on the 21st, and large fires broke out everywhere. The Micabba airfield in Malta was bombed again, and nearby barracks were hit and caught fire.

### Egypt Declares National Martial Law, Four Cabinet Members Resign, Italian Side Regards It as Good Fortune

Cairo, Egyptian Prime Minister Pasha recently announced national martial law. (United Press, 23rd)

Rome, the Cairo government announced that four pro-British and pro-war cabinet members in the Egyptian cabinet have resigned and will be replaced by politicians who support a "wait-and-see" policy. Authoritative sources here believe that this move by Egypt is extremely beneficial to Italy, because after the resignation of the four, most of the remaining Egyptian cabinet members are unwilling to wage war on Italy. It is generally believed that Egypt's foreign policy is now in a very delicate and extremely critical state. General Graziani's planned desert blitz to North Africa will depend on Egypt's decision. (United Press, 23rd)

### Soviet Military Expert Discusses the Anglo-German War, Germany Accelerates Fierce Attacks, Britain Extends Decisive Battle

Moscow, Colonel Shevchenko recently published an article in Pravda entitled "The Battle for the English Channel," which stated, "The German air force is still on the offensive. On the other hand, Britain's only defensive force, the navy, has begun to move. From this point of view, both sides are preparing for a decisive battle. According to the large number of air forces and powerful navies fighting, there is no precedent in history. Therefore, future developments are extremely noteworthy. We believe that the future Anglo-German air and sea war will determine the fate of the German offensive on the English Channel. Germany is now working to accelerate the offensive. On the other hand, the British command is trying to consume the strength of the German air force, while at the same time purchasing a large number of aircraft in the United States to enhance its own air force. In short, the British side is doing its best to postpone the decisive battle." (TASS, 23rd)

### British Air Defense Cannot Be Slackened, Observations of British Experts

London, British aviation expert Stewart said today in a broadcast that the Germans are looking for weaknesses in air defenses, and once they find them, they will take advantage of the situation to break through with all their strength. Germany used this method on France before, and today it is planning to use old tricks against England again. Therefore, the British must always be vigilant and not be slack, and the strength of the air force must be fully maintained. This is the best answer to the British offensive. Britain must continue to build more and better aircraft and expand its sky power. As such, Germany will never be able to invade Britain. This decisive battle is decided in the sky. We should build more aircraft on a large scale. In the past, we often had speculative words about the German air force's superiority and the number of aircraft on both sides. Now there must be no question of the number of aircraft that we should have, because the answer is not the number of aircraft that the enemy has, but our ability to produce aircraft. (Reuters, 23rd)

### Large Numbers of Italians Enter Syria

Istanbul, the increasing number of Italian mission members in Syria has already attracted close attention. Recently, another group of nine Italians arrived in Syria and went to Beirut to join the Armistice Commission. People here are paying more close attention to it, because it is rumored here that Italy has malicious intentions towards Syria. According to travelers who arrived here from Iraq via Syria, Italian activities are very cautious for fear of Syrian people, and even all Arabs, revolting. It is heard that the hatred of Arabs for Italians is now intensifying. (Reuters, 23rd)

### British Aircraft Factory Steps Up Production

London – Minister of Aircraft Production Beaverbrook recently urged aircraft workers to increase production, saying that aircraft production must be greatly increased next week, as the testing time is fast approaching. The aircraft factory is responsible for supplying all the aircraft needed by frontline combat personnel. Men and women throughout the country engaged in the aircraft manufacturing industry have all agreed to meet the needs of the British Air Force. This assurance has been earnestly fulfilled in the past, and in the future, the expectations of aircraft pilots should not be disappointed. (Reuters, 23rd)

Vichy – Former Prime Minister Daladier, after being arrested, was transferred today from the Château de Chazeron to the town of Lyon, to await the summons of the Supreme Court for trial. (Havas, 23rd)

### Fundamental Reform of French Agricultural Production System

Vichy – Minister of Agriculture Caziot recently issued an order to fundamentally reform the French agricultural production system, with provisions for the organization of farms and the distribution of agricultural products. The main points are two: (1) Restore certain types of production enterprises, such as sheep raising, and develop and innovate the planting of textile raw materials such as cotton and hemp, to adapt to modern needs and the new economic structure of post-war France. (2) Although French farmers must abandon excessive individualism, their position in society should be elevated, so that under the guidance of the government, they can cooperate fully. People in the agricultural sector have welcomed this order, saying that the French agricultural production system is outdated, and in fact, except for the production of wheat, sugar beets, and grapes, there is general disorder, which urgently needs to be reformed. (Havas, 22nd)

### Construction Begins in Northern French Industrial Zone

Lille – Under the cooperation of the German authorities and French officials, a plan has now been drawn up to construct the northern French industrial zone of Lille, Roubaix, and Tourcoing. The implementation of this plan will reduce a large number of unemployed people. The defensive obstacles around the city of Lille will be removed, laid with grassland, and converted into sports fields. The citadel will not be demolished. The entire project will be completed by next spring. In addition, the houses in the city of Lille that were destroyed by the war will be rebuilt, and the canal network around the city of Lille will be improved to promote navigation. The traffic situation near the city of Lille is also planned to be improved. (Haitong, 23rd)

### Italian Submarine Sinks Spanish Fishing Boat

Gibraltar – The naval authorities here recently announced that an Italian submarine fired a torpedo and sank the Spanish fishing boat "Calancha." This incident occurred last Thursday morning off Cape Villano in northwestern Spain. All crew members were killed except one survivor who, upon landing in Corunna, said that the submarine that fired the torpedo seemed to be Italian. The crew even threw Italian cigarettes into the small net that was being hauled. Some believe that the "Calancha" was mistaken for a British patrol boat. (Reuters, 23rd)

### Reorganization of French Colonial Administration

Vichy – The French government today ordered the reorganization of the Colonial Supervision Office. All supervisors and general supervisors have been changed to administrative officials, retaining the same powers. The retirement age for general supervisors is set at sixty, and the retirement age for supervisors is set at fifty-six. (Haitong News Agency, 23rd)

Vichy – Regarding General de Gaulle and the British incitement of a revolutionary movement in French colonies against the Vichy government, the extent of its spread, according to Haitong News Agency's inquiry to the French government last night, is as follows: The center of the resistance movement is in French Equatorial Africa, including Ubangi-Chari, with a population of 3.6 million, but only a few hundred white people. The colony of Cameroon, with a population of 2.5 million, is also said to have accepted de Gaulle's orders. The attitude of the people of Togo is wavering, but some of the ruling French are sympathetic to General de Gaulle. The situation in New Caledonia is the same. The governor, Denis, was opposed by the people and fled. From this, it can be seen that those who sympathize with de Gaulle rule over 7 million black people. Only Morocco, Tunisia, West Africa, Algiers, and other places support the Pétain government, with a total population of 30 million. However, the attitude of the people is only a matter of decision. The most important thing is the ruling authorities. As for the final attitude, it depends on the development of the attack on England. (Haitong News Agency, 23rd)

### Earplugs Distributed Throughout Britain

London – Tens of millions of "earplugs" will be distributed free of charge to the people of the country by local authorities. This measure will begin to be implemented soon. It is said that these "earplugs" will not only protect the eardrums but also reduce the noise during air raids, making it easier to fall asleep. (Reuters, 33rd)

### British Authorities Investigate Soldiers' Relatives

London – The British Army, Navy, and Air Force recently announced a plan whereby relatives of soldiers, such as parents and wives, can carry a piece of paper stating the soldier's name and other details, so that in the event of casualties due to air raids, the authorities can notify the soldiers serving in the Army, Navy, and Air Force. (Reuters, 23rd)

### British King Broadcast Last Night

London – The British King will deliver a broadcast speech to the country and abroad at 5:00 PM today (2:00 AM Shanghai time on Tuesday). (Reuters, 23rd)

### German Air Force's Meticulous Transportation Network

Berlin – German officials told Haitong News Agency last night, announcing Germany's control of the air warfare transportation network and signaling operations, claiming that there is a vast means of transportation between naval bases, coastal batteries, and German Air Force signal stations. Along the 1,000-kilometer coastline from Brest to Calais, all airfields, air force ports, and air force headquarters are densely connected by telegram networks. Once the air force is dispatched, all base signal stations and air force headquarters maintain wireless networks. Even though air force personnel are thousands of kilometers away, they can always know all important news and the latest developments. (Haitong, 23rd)

### Britain Agrees in Principle to Transfer of American Ships to Singapore to Defend Malaya, Burma, Australia, and Dutch East Indies; American Aircraft May Remain in Hong Kong to Restrain Japan

Washington – According to sources in Japanese diplomatic circles, Britain and the United States have in principle agreed that the United States Far East Fleet may be stationed in Singapore when the situation permits. It is expected that the recent several talks between US Secretary of State Hull, British Ambassador Lothian, and Australian Minister Casey have largely concluded this matter. Hull told a new reporter last week that the Singapore issue had been discussed, but he did not think formal negotiations had begun or that any decisions had been made. Diplomatic circles pointed out that several weeks ago, British First Lord of the Admiralty Alexander declared that Britain was willing to allow the United States to borrow Singapore so that ships of the US fleet could have the convenience of repairs and mooring when necessary. Therefore, the negotiations were considered unnecessary to prolong. It is believed that whether the US fleet's move from Hawaii to Singapore can truly become a reality depends on the following three essential elements: (1) Japan dispatches troops to Vietnam regardless of US warnings; (2) the request of Admiral Richardson, commander of the Pacific Fleet, who is said to have left Hawaii for home today; (3) the British fleet must both fight the German air force to resist invasion and control the Atlantic and Mediterranean. It is not yet known what Admiral Richardson's views are on the current emergency situation in the Pacific. Experts in international law say that the fleet of a neutral country can be stationed at the base of a belligerent country and still be regarded as the fleet of a neutral country. This is a debatable point. (International, 23rd)

Washington – Experts in the Navy Department and the State Department stated today that establishing a US naval base in Singapore would not only defend the Malay Peninsula, Burma, and Australia, but also protect the United States' sources of tin and rubber in the Dutch East Indies. They also said that this move would free the British Navy from worries about the East and enable it to concentrate on defending its Atlantic bastion to resist Germany's challenge to the Monroe Doctrine. However, people here expressed considerable doubt as to whether Japan would protest against the United States using Singapore as a base, since Britain is not currently at war with Japan. (International, 23rd)

Hong Kong – The fact that Hong Kong will be included in the scope of British-American naval cooperation has aroused general speculation here. The Japanese side is quite silent about this. Qualified observers here believe that if the United States uses Singapore as a base for operations in the Pacific, then, in view of the convenience of Hong Kong for repairing, unloading, and providing military supplies to the navy, Hong Kong will also be included. As a naval base, Hong Kong can be used as an important fortress for Singapore. However, from another perspective, Hong Kong is too close to Shantou and Guangzhou, which have been occupied by Japan. If the United States goes to war with Japan, then the island of Hong Kong will also be useless. However, if Britain and the United States can cooperate in the Pacific, then Hong Kong can be defended and used as a British air base. Observers here all agree that if the United States and Japan do not go to war, the presence of American aircraft in Hong Kong will have a certain restraining force on Japan. (International, 23rd)

### US Asiatic Fleet Departs from Qingdao

Qingdao – The last of the ships of the US Asiatic Fleet, which had been in Qingdao for nearly three months, departed for other destinations after midnight yesterday. These included the flagship USS Augusta, the cruiser USS Marblehead, the flagship USS Isabel, and a destroyer. The destination is unknown, but it is likely to be Shanghai. (Reuters, 23rd)

### Indian Navy Strengthens Its Forces

London – The Admiralty announced today that the navy defending Indian territorial waters has become increasingly powerful since it was expanded last year. The commander is General Fitzherbert, whose term has been extended. Officials also said that India is now working hard to build ships, and Australian shipyards are also building larger naval defense ships to help expand the Indian Navy. Several new-style warships will also be sailing from Britain soon. It is also reported that since Italy's entry into the war, the personnel of the Royal Indian Navy have increased by 200 percent since September 1939, and are still expanding. (United Press, 23rd)

### Chinese Consul-General to the Philippines Broadcasts to the United States, Suggests British-American Alliance to Jointly Prevent Japanese Aggression

Manila – Yang Guang-sheng, the Chinese Consul-General here, gave a radio broadcast to the United States tonight, suggesting that Britain and the United States should form a united front in the Far East to prevent Japanese aggression. Mr. Yang briefly stated, "Unless Britain and the United States are united, we will be divided. The failure of some European countries is due to their inability to cooperate. Therefore, the democratic countries in the Far East must not ignore this again. However, it seems difficult to determine who will be the leader. In short, we should support those who are powerful and determined to fight to the end." Mr. Yang, knowing that the United States is more concerned about the war in Europe, specifically warned, "The United States' assistance to democratic countries, if divided between Europe and Asia, is a fallacy. At this time, even though the United States' power has not been drawn into the whirlpool of war, if it continues to isolate itself and does not take active action, then the massacres and destruction that are now taking place in Europe and Asia will inevitably befall the United States." (United Press, 23rd)

### Philippine Customs Seizes Opium Paste Worth Over Ten Thousand Philippine Pesos

Manila – Five hundred boxes of opium paste, each box weighing one tael, were seized in the Chinese baggage room of the customs here, worth a total of 12,500 Philippine pesos. This contraband was hidden in a leather suitcase. It was found that this suitcase was brought here by a traveler from China on a Dutch Madada ship whose name is not known. Customs detectives waited for three days but did not find the owner of the goods. Therefore, no one has been arrested so far. It is believed that the opium paste came from Hong Kong. (Reuters, 23rd)

### After Returning Home, German Foreign Minister to Meet Spanish Interior Minister; Whether Suner Will Visit Italy is Undecided; New African Order Belongs to Italy

Berlin – After the conclusion of the Rome talks, well-informed sources here commented that the Axis powers often implement resolutions with actions. German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's visit to Rome will be remembered forever throughout the world. The third meeting between the Italian Prime Minister and the German Foreign Minister discussed important political issues. Ribbentrop's four-day visit to Rome has opened up a new situation in the war against England. It is expected that the important diplomatic and political issues discussed in principle at this meeting will promote further diplomatic action. For example, after Foreign Minister Ribbentrop returns home, he will meet again with Spanish Interior Minister Suner. It will be possible to decide whether Suner will visit Rome at that time. The communiqué issued by Spain, expressing its close relationship with the Axis powers, is regarded by people here as a major political factor. As for the extent to which Spain will participate in activities in Europe and Africa, it will be decided by Spain itself. People in Berlin believe that Spain will not stand idly by in the war against its historical enemy, England. Spain's interests in this war, and the attitude of Spanish newspapers in recent days, have clearly stated that a new Spain will actively participate in building a new European order. Political figures in Berlin hinted that this Rome meeting not only discussed important political issues but also discussed the measures to be taken after the victory. After achieving victory, the Axis powers should move forward synchronously and understand each other's goals. Rome and Berlin are in complete agreement on this matter. Regarding the new African order, Rome and Berlin both believe that it should belong to Italy. Germany only seeks colonies. This is an important post-war issue discussed at the Rome meeting. Berlin solemnly pointed out that building a new Europe requires changing the situation in Africa. This point was also agreed upon at the Rome meeting. In addition, the issues discussed should be the Balkan issue, which is extremely important to Italy. Germany's interests in the Danube region have been adjusted by the Vienna Arbitration, so there are no unresolved issues left to be discussed. Italian newspapers have repeatedly discussed the Balkan issues related to Yugoslavia and Greece. At this Rome meeting, Rome and Berlin should have reached an understanding. (Haitong, 23rd)

Berlin – Spanish Interior Minister Suner will return here from the Western Front today. After arriving in Brussels, Mr. Suner will take a special train to Berlin. (Haitong, 23rd)

Berlin – "Essener National-Zeitung," the mouthpiece of German Aviation Minister Goering, commented this morning on the Vienna meeting, saying that new developments are expected in the situation on all sides within a few days after the meeting between German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and other politicians and this Axis powers Rome meeting. Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's departure from Rome only superficially declared the end of the meeting. In terms of the important issues discussed at this meeting, they will become increasingly important in the future. The newspaper then discussed the German-Italian alliance signed by German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and Italian Foreign Minister Ciano in Milan in May of last year, saying that military offensives cannot be announced to the enemy in advance. The resolutions of this Rome meeting cannot be made public until they are mature. Even in the case of the German-Italian alliance signed last year, its contents were only announced some time after the signing. (Haitong, 23rd)

France – "Le Temps" of Clermont-Ferrand commented on German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's trip to Rome, saying that Ribbentrop's trip to meet with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and Foreign Minister Ciano, in addition to discussing the German large-scale offensive against the British Empire and the position of Spain in the current European war, the Balkan Peninsula issue must also be of great importance. From the observation of various phenomena, the situation in that area is extremely chaotic. If the Green-German-Italian Axis powers want to establish a solid foundation for the new European order, then the resolution of various outstanding issues among Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, and Greece is a prerequisite. The resolution of these outstanding issues is more difficult than the cession of Dobruja to Bulgaria by Romania. As for Bulgaria's request that Greece cede Thrace, the Soviet Union supports Bulgaria's request, while Turkey encourages Greece to resist. Germany and Italy cannot ignore this situation. In addition, the Soviet Union's intention to send personnel to attend the future Danube River Navigation Conference is also one of the difficulties. Although Germany and Italy have decided to avoid conflict with the Soviet Union, the intrusion of Soviet power into the Danube River Basin and the Balkan Peninsula is a serious threat to Germany and Italy's policy of establishing a new order in Southeastern Europe and must be prevented in advance. For this reason, it is feared that it will be difficult to find a compromise solution. (Havas, 23rd)

Madrid – The Spanish official news agency's Rome dispatch stated that the saying that Spain will join the war on the side of the Axis powers is absurd. However, it is obvious that Spain's position in Europe is different from that of a mere observer. The Spanish "Falange" newspaper's Rome dispatch mentioned the talks between Germany, Italy, and Spain, saying that Spain's relationship with the Axis powers can be regarded as friendly, but this does not allow for the prediction that Spain will participate in the war. US rumors that Spanish Interior Minister Suner is currently visiting Berlin to convey the proposal for a peaceful effort initiated by British Ambassador to Spain Hoare to overthrow Churchill. Newspaper reporters in Berlin, Spain, will be cautious in responding to it, since these rumors are purely unfounded. Hoare is loyal to the government, and the Spanish and British also believe that final victory will belong to the British side. Only a few Madrid newspapers publish words that are inclined to the Axis powers. After the second incident, Spain's "Voltoza" was sunk between the ports of Huelva and Bilbao. (Reuters, 23rd)

Rome – German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop left here at 6:00 PM yesterday, returning to Berlin in an armored car. The most well-informed sources believe that Spain will soon join Germany and Italy in fighting against England, so as to concentrate attacks on Gibraltar. In addition, it is believed that an agreement has been reached in Southeastern Europe and that Albania, controlled by Italy, has made territorial demands on Greece and southern. (United Press, 23rd)

### Chinese Army in Southern Shanxi Re-Enters Jincheng, Fierce Street Fighting Occurs in the City

Luoyang – The Chinese army launched a fierce attack on the outskirts of Jincheng and entered the city at dawn on the 20th, engaging in fierce street fighting with the Japanese. They repeatedly charged and killed, and Japanese corpses blocked the roads. The Chinese army is still clearing the area. (23rd dispatch)

Luoyang – The battle situation in Jincheng and Yangcheng is very fierce.

### Musings on the European War (10) (2) Hitler's Triumphal Return

Hitler returned to Berlin in triumph on July 6th from Paris. Suburbs lined with welcomers, the whole city in jubilee, a ceremonial occasion even greater than Caesar's. Although the final victory or defeat of the war has not yet been determined, Germany, since being bound by the Treaty of Versailles, has striven for twenty-two years to finally have this day of raising its eyebrows and exhaling, so it is no wonder that Hitler, on his face that always seems to be sealed by severe frost, actually had a smile on his face that day, and all his demeanor was relaxed and lively. That day, the headlines of Berlin newspapers hailed him as the greatest victor in annihilating warfare in world history...God of War...Military Genius...Great Statesman, Aggregate of Supreme Leaders...Victor of 1940, Surpassing the Victor of 1918...Leader of Eighty Million People...Leader from Darkness to Light, exaggerating flattery to the utmost. The following is a record of the grand occasion at the time, as recorded by the New York Times' correspondent in Berlin:

Hitler returned to Berlin's Haltern Station from the front lines at around 3:00 PM on July 6th. Air Minister General Goering and senior government officials were all at the station to welcome him. Hitler's special flower-adorned train car was pulled by two locomotives with flags hanging, and two anti-aircraft gun vehicles escorted along the way. The station platform was covered with a red carpet, and civil and military officials were lined up on the left and right according to the ranking of their official positions, respectfully welcoming him. When Hitler got out of the car, Goering and others stepped forward to shake hands to welcome him. Goering was originally fat and ungainly, but since the two months of war, he has been galloping on the battlefield and has become slightly thinner and more energetic. Following Hitler out of the car were General Keitel, Commander-in-Chief of the National Defense Forces, and Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, among others. Outside the red carpet on the platform, there was also a large silver-gray Iron Cross medal made of pine needles, holly, and red and blue flowers, to celebrate the great achievements of the National Socialist Party leader.

As soon as Hitler stepped from the flower car onto the platform, all the church bells in Berlin rang out sonorously, and only stopped when he arrived at the Prime Minister's Office. He nodded to the officials standing to the left and right as a courtesy, and received the welcoming salute of the National Socialist Youth League. To the sound of the stormtrooper's military music, he stepped into an open-top car; at this time, the Youth League and Girls' League on the opposite platform shouted "Victory...Victory..." endlessly, and the sound waves rose and fell, until the car drove away before it stopped. The platform was brightly lit with torches, and the entrance to the station was decorated with colorful arches, fluttering flags, and banners with floral designs, making it very bright and eye-catching. The handrails of the escalators leading from the station door to the street were woven with garlands of boxwood leaves, symbolizing the glory of victory. The streets were guarded by the Guards, fully armed, three steps one sentry. Each was majestic and exceptionally imposing.

The streets on either side of the one-mile-long street from the station to the Prime Minister's Office were packed with Berlin citizens welcoming Hitler. Propaganda Minister Goebbels had notified the men, women, and children of Berlin that morning, telling them to welcome the head of state with sincere expressions. Calling them to run into the streets and admire the head of state's demeanor. Therefore, the bustling scene on both sides of the avenue was truly beyond the power of words to describe. In advance, German wireless radio had also warned residents not to throw flowers at the head of state as he passed through the streets of Berlin. All flowers offered must be placed on the road before the vehicles passed. The Girls' League and the police had scattered roses and other fresh flowers along the streets before 3:00 AM, creating a gorgeous and fragrant scene.

From 7:00 AM, under the dim sunlight, many men and women were already waiting by the side of the road, carrying paper bags containing the food they would use as breakfast and lunch. Members of the National Socialist Party were distributing small swastika flags by the side of the road. Ice cream vendors could not meet the demand, and ice cream was sold by the ton. There were also those selling simple telescope boxes, and they were also making a lot of money. Wireless loudspeakers were installed on the utility poles at the intersections. Those who were far away or could not squeeze onto the side of the road to watch could listen to all the excitement through the wireless radio broadcast.

(Left) Girls Along the Way Scattered Flowers to Welcome

Ahead of Hitler's car was a car filming a movie, and behind it was Goering's car, one person sitting in one car. Behind them were several cars with senior government officials. The foreign news agency reporters were sitting together in one car. All the officials were wearing military uniforms, fully expressing the spirit of military conquest of other countries. Among them, only economic expert Dr. Schacht wore civilian clothes, and National Socialist Party theorist Dr. Rosenberg sat in the same car. Parading in the rows of the street were also several thousand male and female workers, led by National Socialist Party officers, with the sound of military music constantly ringing in their ears. The Youth League and the Girls' League also participated. According to police estimates, the number of people marching was no less than 200,000.

At 3:16 PM, Hitler's car arrived at the gate of the Prime Minister's Office. A guard of honor was standing at the gate, ready for the head of state to review them, but Hitler did not get out of the car, only returned their salute in the car. There were also several wounded soldiers returning from the front lines waiting. As soon as the car arrived, one of them ran to the front of the car and shook hands with Hitler to pay his respects. Four minutes later, Hitler appeared on the balcony of the Prime Minister's Office building. At this time, the crowd cheered, and the band played the National Socialist Party anthem. The crowd all sang along in a loud voice. Overcome with excitement, everyone cheered loudly, and some even cried with joy.

When Hitler was on the balcony, he was attended by General Goering, General von Brauchitsch, Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Admiral Raeder, Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, Ribbentrop, and Deputy Party Leader Hess. As Hitler raised his arm to salute the crowd, everyone sang the song "We are Attacking England." Because of the heat and the large number of people, coupled with extreme excitement, many women fainted. Fortunately, Red Cross nurses had already prepared and poured cold water on those who had fainted. Hitler watched on the balcony for a while and then retreated.

The crowd still did not disperse. At 3:37 PM, the wireless loudspeaker reported: "Attention everyone. The head of state will meet with you again: please wait a moment and then disperse." At 3:55 PM, Hitler appeared on the balcony again, with Goering standing to his left. He went back in about 13 minutes. The loudspeaker immediately told everyone to disperse, and then the people gradually dispersed. At this point, the grand occasion of the day quickly disappeared.

### Sincere Negotiations in the Electric Tram Strike; Hope for a Satisfactory Resolution; Although No Results Yesterday, the Attitude was Sincere; Both Sides Agreed to Continue Talks This Morning

The strike of all the workers of the British-owned Shanghai Electric Tramway Company in the Public Concession, which began on the 20th of this month, has now been going on for four days. Although the workers had put forward four temporary conditions for resolution, the direct negotiations between the two parties were delayed by two days because the 20th and 22nd were Saturday and Sunday. However, both labor and management, the Concession authorities, and people from all walks of life all hope that the negotiations will have a satisfactory outcome, that traffic within the Concession will be restored immediately, and that they do not want the strike to affect society and be criticized by all parties. This is because public utilities relate to the welfare of the entire citizenry, and disputes between labor and management cannot be rashly triggered, creating large waves. If both parties can take the overall situation as the premise and make concessions to each other, then negotiations will be easier to approach, but this spirit of self-sacrifice must be based on the sincerity and cooperation of the negotiators. It is rumored that the result of the direct negotiations between labor and management yesterday was that the two sides only disputed the issue of wage increases for more than half an hour, and there were still no satisfactory results. As for the remaining three conditions, they were also rejected by the company authorities. Negotiations should continue today, but judging from the current situation, there are still many focal points ahead, and optimism is not yet warranted. The situation obtained yesterday is recorded below, divided as follows:

Direct Negotiations Between the Two Parties Yesterday

At 10:00 AM yesterday, four representatives of all the workers of the British-owned Shanghai Electric Tramway Company went to the Tramway Company on South Suzhou Road to meet with Mr. Bullock, Secretary-General of the company. Mr. Bullock personally received them, and the labor and management then held direct negotiations in the manager's office on the third floor of the company. The labor representatives submitted the four conditions that had already been revised to Mr. Bullock, and said that this was the minimum requirement of all the workers, hoping that the company authorities would approve it immediately so that they could resume work that day and reassure people.

Stalemate on the Wage Issue

After Mr. Bullock accepted the four conditions proposed by labor, he replied to the layer regarding the wage increase as follows: (1) Increase the daily wage by 15 cents; (2) Allowance of 5 cents; (3) Rice subsidy of 10 cents, totaling an increase of 30 cents per day. This is an increase of 5 cents compared to the company's reply to the previous negotiations, which only allowed an allowance of 25 cents. However, the conditions proposed by labor were to cancel the allowance and increase the daily wage by a total of 45 cents. The difference between this and the 30 cents agreed to by the company was still 15 cents. The two sides disputed for half an hour, and there was still no way to resolve it, so that the remaining three conditions, (1) not to dismiss workers on the pretext of anything, Mr. Bullock still said that it should be handled according to usual practice, (2) (3) Wages paid during the strike period and Article 22 of the Labor-Management Mutual Benefit Agreement, Mr. Bullock did not reply to these.

New Developments Possible Today

The labor and management sides held talks for more than an hour, but because the conditions were still far apart, they failed to achieve a satisfactory outcome. At around 11:00 AM, the labor representatives resigned and said that after discussing the conditions replied to by the company with all the workers, they would go to the company again at 10:00 AM this morning to consult and seek a solution. Also, according to investigations, the attitude of both labor and management yesterday was sincere, and if the meeting is held again today, there may be new developments.

Workers State That Livelihood is Difficult

According to a certain worker, the reason for their proposed conditions is that their wages are only half the wages of the tram workers in the French Concession. Their monthly wages are only 70 yuan. Under the current severe inflation, it is difficult to maintain the warmth and food of a family, so they are demanding that the company authorities increase their wages by 13 yuan per month. This is only because they are forced by livelihood. The company often dismisses workers who are deemed to be in poor health when conducting physical examinations every year. This move causes workers who have served for a longer period of time and who are older to suffer the pain of unemployment, and the company has no method of relief. As for the Labor-Management Mutual Benefit Agreement, the content is items that both sides can benefit from.

Total Number of Electric Trams in the Concession is Tallied

The electric trams on each route in the Public Concession are as follows: 22 on Route 1, 30 on Route 2, 12 on Route 3, 1 on Route 5, 6 on Route 6, 4 on Route 9, 10 on Route 14, 38 on Route 16, 27 on Route 17, 7 on Route 18, 10 on Route 19, 16 on Route 20, 7 on Route 21, and 8 on Route 24, totaling 198. There are also about 10 that are regularly stopped at the factory for repairs. Since the complete suspension of operations, in addition to increasing the number of vehicles dispatched to each route, the buses have also "processed and repaired" dozens of old cars that have been shelved for a long time and did not intend to operate in order to adapt to the needs of the environment, and immediately added them to each route. The preparations for the factories, docks, and other places near the electric tram company are still strictly carried out by the Chinese and Western detectives dispatched by the two police departments.

The Company Expresses Sincere Cooperation

A certain staff member of the Public Concession Electric Tram Company told a certain Western newspaper reporter yesterday that the solution proposed by the company was already very fair, and that its treatment of the workers could not be said to be poor. This is because, under the current solution, a newly hired worker can receive a salary of 75 yuan per month, that is, the lowest salary for a worker is 66.2 yuan, plus a rice subsidy of 9 yuan. The salary of most workers at present is 84 yuan per month, plus a rice subsidy of 9 yuan. Although he hoped that the workers would accept the solution proposed by the company, he was not too optimistic. He continued, no matter what, the company should do everything in its power to resolve the strike as soon as possible. During this period, the trams in the Public Concession are still completely stopped, but the tram traffic in the French Concession is still proceeding unhindered.

### Admiral Hart is Coming to Shanghai Soon

The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" states that the minesweeper USS Pigeon of the US Asiatic Fleet, which came to Shanghai from North China last week, is expected to sail out tomorrow (the 24th) to Manila for the winter. Admiral Hart, Commander-in-Chief of the Asiatic Fleet, is expected to arrive in Shanghai soon aboard his flagship USS Augusta, stay for two or three weeks, and then depart. It is also learned that the admiral's private yacht, the Isabel, will return to Shanghai tomorrow.

### Drastic Changes in the Situation in Vietnam; Shanghai is Deeply Indignant; Japanese Warships in the Huangpu River Departed from the Wusong Estuary Heading South; The Defense Situation in Zhejiang and Fujian is Relaxed on the Outside but Tight on the Inside; Ship Schedules on the Shanghai-Vietnam Route Have Not Changed at Present

The situation in Vietnam is tense. The French-Japanese agreement was suddenly signed, and there is talk of Japanese troops landing. Yesterday, the Japanese Consulate on Huangpu Road, north of the Garden Bridge, released a balloon that ascended high into the air, with eight red characters trailing below, saying "Japanese Troops Occupy French Indochina." When the news spread, the citizens believed that the French government was exposing an unfriendly attitude towards China and were very indignant.

Saigon Ship Schedules

As for the various shipping companies in this city, they have not yet received reports from their local branches, nor have they received orders from the port to change their routes, so as of last night, the ship schedules on the Shanghai-Vietnam route of each ship have not changed. Jardine Matheson's Yushan is still scheduled to sail from Shanghai to Haiphong on the 27th, and the Mingsheng is scheduled to go from Shanghai to Haiphong on October 1. The Taikoo Company's Qingyuan is scheduled to set sail from Shanghai on the 26th, passing through Hong Kong to Haiphong and concurrently Guangzhou Bay. Future changes are still difficult to predict.

Japanese Warships Heading South

Japanese warships docked in the Huangpu River departed from the Wusong Estuary heading south, seemingly with some intention. According to telegrams obtained by the shipping industry from eastern Zhejiang yesterday, no less than 20 Japanese warships are currently docked in the vicinity of Zhenhai, Xiangshan Port, and the Oujiang Estuary. However, Japanese warships have spied on places such as Shipu from time to time. However, they have not succeeded in the end. There are also several armed patrol ships converted from Japanese merchant ships that have been constantly cruising along the coast for days, attempting to monitor the incoming and outgoing voyages of ships.

Three Ships Missing

The shipping industry learned that more than ten foreign ships had recently sailed to the Biejin and Wenzhou. Except for a very small number of ships that were able to unload passengers and goods at or near their destinations, and those that had already been blocked and returned, there were still several foreign ships that had no news. Among them, the Anli was stranded on the waters of the Oujiang Estuary (that is, the Ellis Meller), and a telegram had arrived in Shanghai yesterday. The Jiangsu was detained in the waters of Ligang and has not been released. As for the remaining three ships, Daxin, Dali, and Dasheng, their whereabouts are even more unknown. It is expected that they must have been blocked by Japanese warships in another place. As for the British ship Mary Meller, which was shelled by Japanese warships in the waters of Haimen, it has been released, and the Japanese side has agreed to compensate for the losses caused by the shelling.

One Ship Aground

The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" states that the Ellis Meller (1,600 tons) and Jesse Meller (1,800 tons), two ships of the British-owned Meller Company, are currently being detained by the Japanese naval authorities at a certain port near Wenzhou. This news was disclosed by the Meller Company's tugboat Carmen Meller after returning to Shanghai from Wenzhou this morning (the 23rd). Earlier, the company learned that the Ellis Meller was leaking near Wenzhou, so it sent the Carmen Meller to rescue it. The Ellis Meller was carrying a certain number of cargo passengers and ran aground and leaked water near Wenzhou last Friday.

Rescue Denied

The Jesse Meller happened to be sailing nearby, so it sailed close to the Ellis Meller to help, but it was seen by a Japanese naval patrol boat, which immediately escorted the two ships to a certain port (the name of which has not been disclosed) controlled by the Japanese side. On Saturday and Sunday afternoon, Carmen Meller's shipowner, Rossett, negotiated with the Japanese authorities to release the two ships, but to no avail, because the Japanese side insisted that further investigation was necessary before the two ships could be released. Carmen Meller then returned to Shanghai in disappointment. It is reported that the Meller Company is currently drafting a report on the matter and will submit it to the British naval authorities immediately.

### Father Jacquinot to Return to Shanghai at the End of the Month; Will Still Preside Over Relief Work

Father Jacquinot, the former person in charge of the Nanshi Refugee Zone, resigned from his position because of the sudden outbreak of the war in his home country and the displacement of refugees, intending to serve his motherland. Unexpectedly, just after arriving in Hong Kong, France and Germany made peace. Father Jacquinot then dismissed the idea of leaving and stayed in Hong Kong for three months. According to a reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency, Father Jacquinot has resolutely decided to return to Shanghai to preside over refugee relief work because he believes that the refugees here will suffer from freezing and hunger as the severe cold is approaching in the blink of an eye. His trip to Shanghai is scheduled to take place before the end of this month.

Since the start of the war, a large number of children have died in various places, and the situation of children who are homeless and displaced is indeed pitiful. The highest authorities have allocated large sums of money to establish a large number of orphanages and other relief agencies throughout the country. The Shanghai Branch of the National Children's Relief Association deeply feels that this kind of work is urgently needed and earnestly hopes that people from all walks of life in this city will enthusiastically donate.

If you have any donations, please send them to any branch of the government bank in this city at any time. Also, it is reported that the Moore Church on Yuchaqing Road in this city has always attached great importance to social services. It has recently taken in many street urchins, providing them with housing, food, and clothing, and providing them with production training. People from all walks of life who are willing to donate are requested to contact the person in charge of the church at telephone number 900545.

### Shanghai Anti-Tuberculosis Association Held Annual Meeting Yesterday

The Anti-Tuberculosis Association in this city is organized by famous doctors and celebrities in Shanghai. The association holds an annual meeting every year. The annual meeting was held yesterday at the Health Association inside the American Women's Club on Jing'an Temple Road. More than 600 Chinese and Western celebrities attended, with refreshments and various entertainment programs. In addition, there were speeches by Professor Eberen and Dr. Diao Xinde, which was quite a grand occasion for a time.

### The United States Tightens Security Within its Defense Zone; Sends Troops to Station in Police Stations; Two Troops Stationed Permanently in Each of the Six Stations; Rumor That the Putuo Road Police Station was Attacked is Incorrect

A senior official of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Police Department told reporters yesterday that two soldiers from the US Marine Corps Fourth Regiment were ordered to garrison at the police stations within the US defense zone. This is a new system that began on Sunday (22). This has caused rumors that the Putuo Road Police Station was attacked by police from a certain party. The US Marine Corps Fourth Regiment used to patrol the six police stations in the US defense zone, but since Sunday (22), the method has changed, with two soldiers stationed at each police station. This is a routine security measure, not due to any accident. It is found that the six police stations located in the US defense zone are Laozha, Putuo Road, Jing'an Temple, Xinzha, Gordon Road, and Chengdu Road.

Attempted Seizure; Gunfire Stopped it

The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" states that last night (the 22nd), a group of police officers from a certain party attempted to seize the Pudu Road Police Station and were stopped by the patrol officers of the police station, causing the US Marine Corps Fourth Regiment soldiers to garrison the Pudu Road Police Station this morning (the 23rd). Official figures did not give a clear statement on this matter, but they could not deny that there were suddenly US soldiers stationed at the Pudu Road Police Station.

Bowen, Chief of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Police Department, said that he did not know of any accidents at the Pudu Road Police Station, and that he would have been notified if there had been an incident. However, according to credible sources, last night a number of police officers from a certain party attempted to take over the Putuo Road Police Station, and were shot at by patrol officers, thus averting the occurrence of a serious incident.

Also, according to a certain US military officer, everything is peaceful within the US defense zone, and the US military's garrisoning of the Pudu Road Police Station is not surprising, because the US military's move is only a new post, and the post is often mobile. Attempted

Attack on the Police Station

Regarding the matter, the officialdom did not make any statement, so the reason for it cannot be confirmed. At the same time, the Pudu Road Police Station was heavily guarded this morning. It is said that this move was to prevent any other party from seizing the police station. According to reports, the location of the Pudu Road Police Station is indeed quite difficult, as it is located on the edge of the Public Concession and is adjacent to the badlands.

### Dispute at the Isolated Army Camp: Resolution Expected Within Days - Agreement in Principle Reached, Further Discussions Needed for Post-Conflict Matters

Regarding the dispute at the Isolated Army Camp, yesterday there were widespread rumors of a complete resolution. According to reliable sources, Deputy Director-General of the Public Works Department (PWD), Mr. H.O. Hooper, Commander of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, Colonel Hempton, and Commander of the White Russian Detachment, Major Mann, met with Regiment Commander Xie Jinyuan the day before yesterday afternoon. Although the detailed content of the meeting is unknown, it is confirmed that the opinions of both sides are approaching agreement. Principles have been agreed upon regarding ensuring the security of the concession, upholding the Isolated Army's upright stance, clarifying responsibility for the incident, preventing similar incidents from happening again in the future, and adopting thorough measures to obtain possible and reliable guarantees. Several minor issues, such as the financial burden of the Isolated Army and the post-conflict arrangements for the dead and wounded soldiers, still need to be discussed further for appropriate resolution. In summary, both sides are willing to engage in discussions with candor and sincerity, hoping to seek a thorough and permanent solution. The so-called complete and satisfactory resolution is premature. Yesterday, the barbed wire in front of the Isolated Army Camp was not removed, the gate remained tightly closed, visitors were not received, and there was no sign of relaxed security.

External Gifts Can Now Be Delivered

According to another source, a PWD official told a Western reporter that the news of the resolution of the Isolated Army Camp incident seems likely to be confirmed. He said that food and medical supplies for treating the wounded can now be freely delivered into the Isolated Army Camp. At the same time, police and the White Russian Detachment of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps are still maintaining strict guard around the Isolated Army Camp. The Isolated Army in the camp still had no electric lights at night, and powerful searchlights continued to shine into the camp. The PWD official also said that the Isolated Army Camp was very quiet yesterday, and the conflict between the Chinese army and the French guards in the French Concession concentration camp has also been resolved. The French Concession authorities are now working hard to improve the food in the concentration camp.

PWD Donates Large Quantities of Food

According to a statement released by the PWD Information Office, yesterday (the 22nd) at around 2:00 PM, the PWD purchased lard, salt, and a large quantity of vegetables, long beans, and winter melon, totaling 600 catties, and sent them to the Isolated Army Camp on Jiaozhou Road. The situation there is currently quite calm. The resolution of this dispute is expected to be completed satisfactorily within days.

### Public Bus Negotiations: Harmonious Opinions - Meeting Process is Good - Further Discussions Still Needed - Labor Strike Can Be Avoided

The labor-management dispute at the British-owned China General Omnibus Company, which has been brewing, held its second meeting yesterday at 3:00 PM at the company's second floor. Twelve labor representatives (four each from drivers, conductors, and coppersmiths) and company representatives from the traffic management department, discussed the matter. Neither side was willing to make any announcements about the results. According to a labor representative who spoke to a Datong News Agency reporter after the meeting, "The labor side requested the authorities to respond to the 23 demands previously made. Both sides engaged in negotiations with the utmost sincerity, based on a mutually beneficial standpoint. The process was good. However, due to the need for one or two more rounds of discussions, detailed content cannot be revealed at this time. What can be said is that the prospects for a satisfactory resolution are very promising. A labor strike will not break out even during the tram workers' strike. Both sides are willing to prioritize public safety and the interests of the citizens, therefore, they maintain an optimistic attitude."

Company Announcement States the Process

The company authorities issued a statement yesterday, declaring its position and the facts of the matter, divided into eight points. The original text reads: "In order to dispel all misunderstandings, the following process is specifically announced so that the company's employees can understand the truth. (1) On August 24 of this year, the labor representatives of the company first sent the original text of the 23 demands to the company. (2) The company authorities sent a reply on September 5 and published the reply in the announcement column. (3) Subsequently, last Wednesday (September 18), a rebuttal to the company's reply was submitted to the company authorities. The content of this rebuttal is largely the same as the original text of the demands sent on August 24. (4) It is a well-known fact that a response cannot be hastily made to requests with excessive conditions without thorough consideration. (5) The company deeply desires to seek a permanent understanding and is prepared to continue friendly consultations to achieve a satisfactory result. (6) According to Chinese newspaper reports, the company received requests for additional rice subsidies and coal subsidies last Friday. In order to clarify the truth and dispel misperceptions, the company specifically declares that no such requests were made during the consultations last Friday. (7) The company will publish various responses at any time and place in the future so that our employees can understand the proceedings of the meeting. (8) As for the rumors that the company's business is booming, this is completely untrue. The daily income is difficult to maintain the huge increase in operating expenses. Secretary-General: Ku Laiqi, September 23, 29th year of the Republic of China."

### Postage Increase: First Day Yesterday - Remittances and Parcels Not Yet Subject to Additional Fees - New Stamps Being Rushed to Print

Yesterday was the first day of the postage increase. A Datong News Agency reporter visited various postal branches in the two concessions yesterday. Many members of the public were able to affix sufficient postage according to the new increased rates when mailing items. However, there were also quite a few cases where insufficient postage was affixed and were discovered by the post office when stamping and returned to the sender for re-affixing. This is an inevitable phenomenon at the beginning of implementation and should gradually decrease in a few days. As for the decision to increase postage, it does not apply to remittance fees. Some members of the public who seek clarification of the postal law often speculate about this. In fact, the post office has been collecting supplementary water fees for remittance fees at any time due to transportation difficulties. The increase in this supplementary water fee does not need to be drafted by the Ministry of Communications and approved by the Executive Yuan, and the same is true for parcel postage. Both can be adjusted by the local post office depending on the transportation situation. As for the new postage stamps after this price increase, they are currently being rushed to print in Hong Kong. Before the printing is completed, old stamps will continue to be used, as long as they are affixed to the new rate. Even when the new stamps are issued in the future, the stamps currently in use can still be used for a considerable period of time before a notice is issued to abolish them within a certain period.

### Japanese Erect Barbed Wire Fence on Vacant Land in Penglai Market

Recently, the Japanese hired a large number of coolies to erect barbed wire fences around the vacant land in the Penglai Market on Penglai Road in Nanshi. In July, more than 300 Japanese soldiers carried armored vehicles, small cannons, and heavy machine guns to conduct exercises there. This decision to add repairs indicates that the Japanese army will conduct exercises again on the vacant land.

### Hong Kong Government: Restricts Chinese Entry - Must Obtain a Permit to Land - Residents Leaving Hong Kong Also Need a Permit

In order to restrict the continued increase in the population of Hong Kong, the Hong Kong government will establish an Immigration Bureau. Chinese residents of Hong Kong who leave Hong Kong must obtain a certificate from the Immigration Bureau, similar to a passport, and present it to the Immigration Bureau for verification upon returning to Hong Kong before being allowed entry. Chinese people who do not reside in Hong Kong and wish to come to Hong Kong must obtain a passport or entry permit in advance before being allowed entry. Chinese people will no longer be able to enter and leave Hong Kong as freely as before. This method can be officially implemented within this month after it is passed by the Legislative Council.

### Flour Merchants Hoarding and Speculating, Market Prices Chaotic - Authorities Issue Announcement Promising Severe Punishment - Factory Prices are Enough for Reasonable Cost-Based Pricing - Abnormal Flour Market Hinders People's Livelihoods - Citing Vietnamese Situation, Rice Market Fluctuated Again Yesterday

The Public Works Department's announcement states: "It has been found that the retail flour merchants in the two concessions are selling flour daily that is supplied by the Shanfu Feng and Fuxin flour mills, with over eight thousand bags supplied daily (except Sundays). Shanfu Feng supplies five thousand bags, and Fuxin supplies over three thousand bags. The amount of flour received by each flour store is reported daily to the Public Works Department by the above two factories for verification. Currently, the factory price is sixteen yuan and fifty cents per bag, which has increased by one yuan compared to the previous week. This is enough to cover costs. The two flour mills, considering the overall situation, have decided not to raise prices further for the time being. As for the retail prices of each flour store, it was previously stipulated that each bag should be increased by three cents based on the factory price, and should not exceed that."

Disregarding the Overall Good: Severe Punishment Will Be Given

"However, recently, a small number of flour stores, fearing that factory prices will rise again, have been hoarding the flour they receive and are unwilling to sell it, resulting in an abnormal flour market with chaotic prices. This situation hinders the livelihood of the people and is no small matter. The authorities of the two concessions have recently received numerous reports from users and have paid close attention to this matter. In the future, if anyone disregards the overall good and continues to hoard and speculate, once the facts are verified, severe punishment will be imposed according to law in order to stabilize the market and maintain the food supply."

Rice Market Fluctuated Again Yesterday Morning

"The rice prices in rice shops, tea houses, and market stalls have been quite stable recently. Public sentiment has shifted downwards, and market prices are unanimously expected to fall. After the market opened at 7:30 yesterday morning, public sentiment suddenly became firm again. Speculators vigorously raised market prices, sparing no effort. The market situation was chaotic and abnormal. Speculators cited the tense situation in Vietnam, claiming that Japanese troops had landed and the source of foreign rice would be cut off. Therefore, large households tightly hoarded existing stocks, and the number of customer accounts increased, resulting in a shortage of existing stocks in the market and prices were uniformly raised. As a result, new domestic rice, japonica, and thick japonica rice all increased by two yuan compared to the previous listing price. The private sale price of foreign rice also increased by five to seven or eight cents. According to rice industry insiders, even if Japanese troops have indeed landed in Vietnam, the impact on the source of foreign rice is minimal. Although Saigon foreign rice may not be shipped to Shanghai in large quantities in the future, it can still be transshipped from other ports. Yesterday, the Taikoo Company's Jinan ship transported more than 6,400 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong. In addition, Siamese foreign rice will not be cut off at that time and can still be transported to Shanghai for regulation. Furthermore, the source of domestic rice has increased compared to the previous days. If the hoarded rice can be released on schedule, then rice prices are still expected to fall."

### New Japanese Consul General to Shanghai Arrived Yesterday Afternoon

"After the Japanese Consul General in Shanghai, Miura Yoshiaki, was ordered to be transferred to Mexico as a minister, the newly appointed Consul General, Horiuchi Kanjyo, arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon aboard the Taiyo Maru. Horiuchi is a well-known expert on China. After graduating from the Japanese Tongwen College in Shanghai, he returned to Japan and entered university to major in law. He was originally the director of the East Asia Division of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Since the change of the Japanese cabinet, when Konoe returned to power, he was transferred to his current position, concurrently serving as a counselor at the embassy. As for Miura Yoshiaki, after the handover procedures are completed, he will depart for Japan on the 26th, stay briefly, and then go to Mexico to take office."

### PWD Mounted Patrol Holds Farewell Drill - Inspected Yesterday at the Gordon Road Police Station - Chairman and Chief Constable Present to Preside Over Ceremony

"Yesterday was the date for the PWD Mounted Patrol to hold a farewell drill. At 2:00 PM, amidst drizzling rain, this long-standing Indian police mounted patrol made its final gathering at the Gordon Road Police Station training ground. At that time, the police officers dressed neatly and mounted their horses, first taking a group photo for remembrance. Then, Chairman Ke Ziwei and Chief Constable Bowen, and Deputy Chief Constable Robertson, who manages the mounted patrol, inspected them once and gave a speech in English on the spot, which was translated into Hindi by an interpreter. Ke first stated the reasons for the disbandment of the mounted patrol, roughly saying, since the operation of horse-drawn carriages on Jing'an Temple Road, things have changed, which is not the same as in the past. In this era of mechanization, the patrol of various roads outside the boundary, in addition to the mounted patrol, can be replaced by other methods, which are more effective and more economical, and so on. Then, he reviewed the past history of the mounted patrol. The meaning of his words was quite concise. After the speech, they dispersed."

### Case of Murder in the Da Zhonghua Hotel - Younger Brother Plots to Kill Older Brother - Does Not Engage in Proper Occupation and Covets Older Brother's Money - Colludes to Commit Murder and Ultimately Cannot Escape the Net of Justice

"On the night of the 24th of last month, a murder case suddenly occurred in room 528 of the Da Zhonghua Hotel on Yuchiaqing Road. The deceased, named Zhou Xiuzheng, was from Huzhou, 24 years old, and lived at No. 49 Fengyu Lane, Saposai Road. He was the chief accountant at the Liyuan and Fuyuan customs broker on Gongguan Road in the French Concession. He was strangled to death in that room. At the time, the police were unable to find out the cause of Zhou's death and who the murderer was."

Great Violation of Ethics

"Now, after a month of detailed investigation by Liu Junjie, detective of the Old Gate Police Station, and detectives Zhang Bingchun, the ins and outs of this case have been completely clarified. It is actually a case of a younger brother plotting to kill his own brother. Since the war, the morals of Shanghai have changed greatly, and there have been great violations of ethics. There has been a tragic case of a parent killing their biological father and dismembering the body to destroy the evidence, followed by an incident of a younger brother attempting to shoot his older brother unsuccessfully, and then the occurrence of this case, which is really regrettable."

Does Not Engage in Proper Occupation "The deceased, Zhou Xiuzheng's younger brother, Zhou Xiude, is 18 years old. He usually does not engage in proper occupation and specializes in wandering. He often goes to gambling dens to gamble, causing him to be economically strapped from time to time. He repeatedly asked his brother for loans, which were often rejected, causing Xiude to harbor resentment. He secretly thought that his brother was in charge of the financial power of the two customs brokers, so he planned to kill him in order to seize the funds he was in charge of. Once the evil thoughts were born, he disregarded the great righteousness."

Induced to Go to a Hotel

"He immediately discussed with a bad friend, Mr. Jia, and decided that at about 4:00 PM on the 24th of last month, Xiude would invite his brother, Xiuzheng, to room 528 of the Da Zhonghua Hotel, and then go to see a movie at Shanghai Light. After returning to the hotel, Xiude invited Mr. Jia, as well as Tao Defeng (also known as A Gou) from Tongzhou and Ni Shiqi (also known as Guo Cong) from Haimen, to have dinner at the hotel together. He then summoned Tao Wang, a Suzhou woman (also known as Wang Xiuling, 17 years old, who is Tao Defeng's concubine) from the Queen's Guide Agency on Shantou Road to persuade him to drink."

Intoxicated with Wine and Women

"Xiude used wine and women to intoxicate his brother. Xiuzheng did not know this and fell into his trap. At 10:30 PM, Zhou Xiuzheng was already drunk. Tao then sent Wang Xiuling away and then acted violently, strangling Zhou Xiuzheng with a rope. Zhou Xiude obtained the keys to the Liyuan and Xinyuan silver boxes from the deceased's body and went to the customs broker to steal more than 580 US dollar tickets, worth 10,000 yuan, and a check for 2,600 yuan."

Murder for Money

"He then summoned Wang Xiuling, told her the truth, and instructed her not to make a fuss. Zhou Xiude and others thought that this matter was unknown to the gods and ghosts, but it was discovered by the detectives. The detectives arrested Zhou Xiude at No. 49 Fengyu Lane, Saposai Road, the day before yesterday, and arrested Tao Defeng, Ni Baoqi, Wang Xiuzhen, and a fellow villager, Zhu Qitai, at No. 5 Yongji Lane, Wangzhi Road, in the French Concession. Mr. Jia had fled to other ports. Zhou Xiude confessed that after killing his brother and obtaining the money, except for 200 yuan owed to the gambling den, the rest of the money was taken away by Mr. Jia and fled."

The Net of Heaven is Vast

"Tao Defeng, after being arrested, committed suicide by swallowing fragments of his glasses in fear of punishment. After the detectives discovered this, they were rushed to the hospital for treatment. Yesterday morning, this case was escorted to the First Criminal Court of the Special Court. The police attorney, Ru Baoyi, requested permission for temporary detention and rescheduling for another hearing because this case still needs to be further investigated and the fugitives must be arrested. Judge Xiao Xiefei interrogated each of the defendants once and ordered them to be detained to await rescheduling for another hearing."

### Female Servant Colludes with Her Husband to Commit Robbery - Principal Offender Killed on the Spot - Female Servant and Two Male Bandits Arrested Together

"Zhu Fulin, a native of Yangzhou, is 31 years old and works as a barber at the Huiguang Barber Shop at No. 3 Yangjing Bridge, Jiangxi Road. His wife, Wu, also known as A Jin, is 21 years old and works as a maid for Guangdong woman Zheng Liang at No. 16 Qingyun Lane, La'erdong Road, in the French Concession. Recently, Zhu became heavily indebted due to gambling and was unable to make up for it, so he had evil intentions."

Communicated with His Wife

"He wanted to rob the property of his wife's employer, Zheng Liang. He first made a fake pistol. On the evening of the 22nd, Zhu first asked his concubine, Wang Yang (28 years old and from the same hometown as Zhu), to notify his wife that the robbery was approved for that night. At the same time, Zhu also colluded with his wife's cousin, Jiang Songlin (21 years old, from Yangzhou, and works as a helper at the Ximen Ximen bathhouse). At 10:00 PM that night, Zhu, holding a small knife, and Jiang, holding a fake pistol, went to Zheng Liang's house, knocked on the back door, and Zhu Wu and Wang Yang opened the door, letting Zhu Jiang in. They first chatted in the kitchen, waiting."

Waiting for Late at Night

"At 2:00 AM, knowing that the master, Zheng Liang, and her children were all asleep, Zhu and the four men and women entered the living room, first tied up the master's daughter, Xiao Mei, and then went upstairs to enter the room. Zhu Jiang showed off the fake pistol and small knife, threatening them to silence them. Then, after tying up Liang, they searched her body for a bunch of keys and 15 yuan in cash, and Zhu Jiang used the keys to open the wardrobe and search, obtaining a gold watch, two gold rings, 115 yuan in cash, and clothes, dividing them into three packages and throwing them downstairs to Zhu Wu Wang Yang." Zhu and others were in the midst of

Searching

"Zheng Liang's son, Zheng Heqing, who was sleeping on the third floor, heard the noise, knew that a robbery was occurring, and remained calm. He climbed out of the window into the neighbor's house, went outside to call the police, and telephoned the French police station. Detective Shen Jinshu led detectives Chen Fusheng, Zhou Qingfang, Zhang Yulin, and patrol officers, and drove in police cars to the back door of the victim's house to wait. They first saw Zhu Wu and Wang Yang each holding packages and escaping, and immediately arrested them. Then they saw the two thieves, Zhu Jiang, escape. The detectives saw them holding guns under the lights."

Resisting Form

"Detective Zhang Yulin fired three shots in a row, hitting Zhu in the left shoulder, left waist, and right leg, causing him to fall to the ground with injuries. When Jiang saw Zhu being shot down, he froze and did not dare to move, and was arrested. The fake pistol, knife, and stolen goods were seized. The detectives took Jiang and Wu Yang back to the police station for investigation. Zhu was sent to Guangci Hospital, but due to serious injuries, he died before he could be treated. The body was moved to the Tongren Fuyuan branch for examination. The prosecutor of the Second Special Court was immediately requested to come to the site for identification at noon. The body was buried by the charitable hall."

Three O'Clock in the Afternoon

"The police station escorted Jiang Songlin, Zhu Wu, and Wang Yang to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special Court, where Judge Sun Pengxian interrogated them. The police attorney requested a postponement for further investigation and another hearing. Then, Detective Chen Fusheng and the victim separately reported the circumstances of the robbery and presented the stolen goods to the court. After the court verified the reports and questioned the defendants, it ordered them to be detained to await another hearing on October 7."

"Huifeng Silk Shop at No. 31, 5th Street, Shanxi Road, was jointly established by three brothers from Shaoxing, Xu Huitang, Xu Huisheng, and Xu Huijun, and hired Zhu Renan as a runner. On the 12th of this month, Zhu Renan went to Antai Silk Shop at No. 240, 11th Street, Fujian Road, and selected 160 pieces of silk, worth 9,200 yuan. At that time, five pieces of samples were sent first. After the selection was completed, 155 pieces were sent the next day, and payment was requested. Huifeng Silk Shop claimed that the goods had not been completely inspected and asked to pay on the 16th. When Antai Silk Shop ordered its partners to collect the money at that time, they said that the Mid-Autumn Festival was approaching and asked them to collect it on the 18th. After that, they went to collect it several times, but were repeatedly rejected, saying that the cloth had been sent to Kaizier Road Baodaxiang and Xiedaxiang foreign goods stores for consignment. Antai conducted an investigation and found that Baodaxiang did have the goods, but Xiedaxiang did not consign them. Moreover, there were only junior employees in Huifeng Silk Shop, and no one was responsible. Antai Shop hired lawyer Fan Gang to report to the police station, which sent detective Tao Rubi to arrest the suspect Xu Huitang.

"The storefronts and houses in Duxing Lane on Gongguan Road in the French Concession are the property of Liu Chengxu, a wealthy merchant from Nanxun, and are currently managed by his son, Liu Yuande, who has established a property management office to collect rent on a monthly basis. For several years, the leases have been renewed annually. Recently, as the time for lease renewals approached, the landlord suddenly appointed lawyer Li Qingmu to issue notices to vacate the premises. On the one hand, he also filed a lawsuit in the Second Special District Court, requesting a judgment ordering Wanyuan and Huacheng No. 2 to vacate the premises. More than ten tenants in the lane, including Zhenhua, Daxingchang, and Xintai, are concerned that with fewer houses than people, it will be difficult to find a house. If they cannot renew their leases, they will have nowhere to live. They went to lawyer Li to plead for lease renewals, but were unable to resolve the issue because the rent increase was too high.

(Yong'an Dispatch) The Fujian Provincial Government has formulated interim measures for subsidizing the food of staff and students of secondary and higher schools, primary school teachers, and social education personnel in wartime. These measures have been proposed, passed by the Provincial Government Council, and announced for implementation. The resolutions are recorded as follows: (1) In order to subsidize the food of staff and students of secondary and higher schools, primary school teachers, and social education personnel in this province during wartime, the Fujian Provincial Government, in accordance with the Executive Yuan's order promulgating interim measures for subsidizing the food of college and secondary school students in wartime, and with reference to the local situation in this province, formulates these measures.

Provincial Vocational Schools and Secondary Schools

(2) For students in provincial vocational and higher schools and normal schools whose food expenses are paid by the Provincial Government, starting from this semester, the food expenses for the last month of the semester will be paid in advance at the beginning of each semester. The remaining expenses will be paid monthly until the end of the semester, at which time the advance payment for the last month will be deducted to settle the account. (3) For students in provincial vocational and higher schools and normal schools whose food expenses are paid by the Provincial Government, the monthly amount is set at eight yuan. The required rice will be purchased on behalf of the schools by the local Public Grains Bureau, grain purchasing agency, or county government, and the price will be paid according to the purchase and transportation costs. Each person will be issued 30 market catties of brown rice, with a standard issuance price of 6 market catties per yuan. If the cost is more than 6 market catties per yuan, it should be calculated according to the cost. If the cost is less than 6 market catties per yuan, the amount of the loss should be settled by the school on a monthly basis, and a distribution budget and student roster should be prepared, along with the wholesale order and receipt from the agent, and submitted to the Provincial Government for approval. The aforementioned loss funds will also be advanced by the Provincial Government for one month's equivalent amount to facilitate turnover. (4) For students in provincial senior and junior high schools and senior and junior vocational schools, a monthly food allowance of a certain amount will be issued by the Provincial Department of Education, taking into account the local rice prices and the current number of students in each school. Each school should establish a committee to review the number of needy students who should receive the allowance, and the standards for student food allowances will be determined separately. (5) Starting from this semester, provincial senior and junior high schools and senior and junior vocational schools will pre-pay the funds required for student rice for the last month of the semester at the beginning of the semester, entrusting the local Public Grains Bureau, grain purchasing agency, or county government to purchase and distribute it on their behalf, according to the cost of purchase and transportation, with a standard of 30 market catties per student per month. If the schools are located in rice-producing areas, they may also use the pre-paid funds for one month and the student fees collected to make adjustments and purchase rice in advance.

County and Private Schools at All Levels

(6) The rice required for teachers and staff of county and provincial schools at all levels, Zhongshan People's Schools, and social education personnel should be calculated according to the number of people, at 30 market catties per person per month, with a standard of 5 market catties per yuan. It should be purchased and distributed on behalf of the schools by the local Public Grains Bureau, grain purchasing agency, or county government. The loss funds should be requested from the provincial treasury by provincial schools according to the procedures stipulated in Article 3. County schools should be borne by the county treasury. Before unified supply, rice allowances equivalent to the subsidized standard price (30 market catties per person per month, 5 market catties per yuan) may be given instead. (7) The county governments should consider the local situation and refer to the measures for provincial junior high schools and junior vocational schools to provide unified relief for students' rice in county junior high schools and junior vocational schools, and report to the Provincial Government for record. (8) For rice for staff, students, laborers, and primary school teachers of private secondary and higher schools, each school should prepare a list based on the actual situation and consult with the local county government or district office to assist in purchasing. If in a rice-producing area, rice may also be purchased in advance according to actual needs. If transportation is required, the county governments and military, police, and transportation agencies may be consulted to provide full assistance and convenience for the required boats, vehicles, manpower, and transportation. (9) The schools shall be responsible for the students' food, assisting the students in handling it. (10) All schools should earnestly implement the Outline of Measures for Implementing Agricultural Production in Schools at All Levels promulgated by the Ministry of Education to cultivate students' agricultural life skills and increase students' food nutrition. (11) The quantity of student food in each school shall be investigated by the provincial health and education authorities from the necessary foods, and the quantity required by each student per month according to their age shall be determined to meet nutritional requirements, and each school shall conduct a joint investigation and report to the Provincial Government for reference. (12) After the implementation of these measures, the original rice allowances for primary school teachers may be cancelled. However, if each county can buy more than five market catties of rice per yuan at half price, the rice for staff and students of the local school shall still be purchased at market prices and shall not be subject to the provisions of these measures. (13) These measures shall be implemented after approval and promulgation by the Provincial Government.

### Unhappy Incident in Charity Basketball Challenge Match, Yuan Ludeng Has Been Appointed to Mediate, Please Bailemen to Make an Effort, No Reply Has Been Received from the Team as of Yesterday

The unhappy incident caused by the boos of some ignorant spectators in the charity basketball challenge match has now caused a great uproar. Bailemen officially sent a letter to the Orphanage yesterday, stating its difficulties and declining future invitations. The spark has already ignited a prairie fire, not only affecting the suspension of charity, but also causing true fans to lose the opportunity to appreciate a series of good shows. Yuan Ludeng, Chairman of the Orphanage, expressed deep regret about this and volunteered to mediate in order to restore the grand event. Yesterday, he personally sent Chief Executive Pan Hongding to persuade the person in charge of Bailemen, asking them to make an effort for the education of more than 600 orphans. However, Bailemen needs to consult the opinions of all team members before replying, so there was no result yesterday.

Yuan Ludeng's Statement

Yuan Ludeng issued a statement yesterday, saying that this charity competition was promoted to raise funds for the Orphanage. Such as the United Cup, the mini-football, and this challenge match, have been greatly supported by all sectors of society, which is very grateful. The players' efforts and the audience's donations are both a charitable goal, and should be respected each other. Even if the players have occasional performances that do not meet public opinion, they should be understood. Moreover, in high-level artistic performances, it is permissible that in the ever-changing and tense competition, without understanding the skills, they arbitrarily boo. One person advocates it, and thousands of people blindly follow. And after the event, when asked, the blind followers did not understand what they were responding to. Therefore, strict adherence to order is necessary. This kind of meaningless action, small enough to hurt feelings, big enough to spoil things. A wonderful game, often because of this meaningless stimulation, makes the players' psychology in the field abnormal. This challenge match was initiated, and Bailemen bravely accepted it, which has shown its fearless spirit. And its excellent ball skills allow the audience to appreciate wonderful works, which is so fortunate. And its spirit of sacrificing for charity is even more admirable. It is unexpected that the addition of misfortune is close to ridicule. Putting yourself in their shoes, how can you not be discouraged? The occurrence of this unfortunate incident is deeply regrettable. However, in order to prevent the charity match from being interrupted, I have tried my best to mediate. I believe that Bailemen will be eager to do good deeds and will definitely be able to make an effort. But I hope that the enthusiastic audience, since they are here to support the charity match, should show a kind of sympathy to any team or player who is doing their best for charity, and do not deliberately criticize them, so as to disrupt the order of the venue.

### Silver and Money Cup Table Tennis Tournament, Zhonghui Defeats Guangdong, Four Games Tonight

In the third Silver and Money Cup Table Tennis Tournament, Zhonghui fought against Guangdong at the Yinlian Club's ball room last night. Zhonghui relied on its average talent and led all the way. Yuan Genshan, Chen Qianhao, and Han Yongkang, three strong players, worked especially hard, and their smashes were quite outstanding. With Zhang Zhihong joining the team, Guangdong's strength has increased a lot. Unfortunately, the other players' ball skills are relatively poor. After the game reached eight to ten, they could not catch up again. Although Zhang was fierce and good at fighting, he could not support the building alone. As a result, Zhonghui defeated Guangdong with a score of thirteen to eight.

### Finance, Hong Kong Throws Out Huge Amounts of US Dollars, Exchange Rate Between US Dollars and British Pounds Rises in This City

In yesterday's foreign exchange market, the HSBC list remained unchanged. The underground market for British pounds and US dollars initially tightened but then loosened before stabilizing. As a result, the British pound remained flat and the US dollar slightly strengthened. Due to negative news that day, such as the four countries of China, the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States taking concerted action in the Far East, and actively providing economic assistance to China, a selling trend began. In addition, a certain Chinese bank, acting on behalf of Hong Kong, sold a huge amount of US dollars for September and October, reaching more than 500,000 yuan. At one point, it loosened to three and a half cents and 5.34375 yuan. At noon, sellers suddenly decreased, and the situation turned slightly. Later in the market, due to news of Japanese troops landing in Vietnam, speculators bought up 200,000 US dollars, causing 5.3125 yuan to be difficult to settle.

Compared with the weekend, the British pound was flat and the US dollar strengthened by 0.03125. After the opening, the British pound once weakened to 3.46875 cents, but soon exporters suddenly threw out September futures shillings, and a certain American bank also had a willingness to supply, and the market immediately stabilized. It is estimated that a foreign company sold September British pounds to a foreign bank for 3.484375 cents, and a certain bank sold September feverfew to a peer for 5.25 yuan. The HSBC list was announced and did not move, and the silver balance tax was announced and did not rise or fall. After that, a certain Chinese bank suddenly sold a huge amount of US dollars on behalf of Hong Kong, so the market turned loose. However, the British pound was relatively stable. It is estimated that Hong Kong Telecom sold spot shillings to foreign banks for three and a half cents. At the same time, a certain bank spat out September US dollars to Chinese banks and peers for 5.34375 yuan. After 12:30, the number of sellers decreased, and the situation slightly recovered. By closing, the British pound was 3.484375 cents, and the US dollar was 5.3125 yuan.

The Market Situation Stabilized Slightly in the Afternoon

The market situation turned quiet in the afternoon, and transactions decreased. It was only heard that speculators slightly bought in, estimated to have bought September US dollars from Datong and other foreign banks for 5.3125 yuan, and October US dollars for 5.3125 yuan and 2.8125 yuan. The situation seemed slightly weak. After buying in, foreign banks were still willing to sell, and the situation stabilized. By the evening, the bank's spot selling price was 3.484375 cents for the British pound and 5.3125 yuan for the US dollar, and 3.46875 cents for the October British pound and 5.28125 yuan for the US dollar.

### The Future of the Pacific is Favorable to China, the Gold Market Suffers a Sudden Drop

Yesterday's cash gold underground market situation, after the gold market rose for several days last week, a sudden drop occurred at the beginning of the week. The reason is that there are rumors that China, the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States will take joint five-help actions in the Far East, and that they will provide economic assistance to China again. As a result, many households were frightened and released their urgent needs, and the floating air took the opportunity to make a move and increased their leverage. Although a certain money exchange industry took a unique approach and continued to absorb, it was ultimately in vain. The opening price was still 6,280 yuan. Although it rose to a high price of 6,290 yuan, the gold companies then fiercely came out of the multi-party, and the floating more followed to close, and it was heard that the exchange market was loosening, and when it fell below 6,240 yuan, there was a lack of buyers to maintain it, and it fell miserably into the 6,200 yuan mark, with the lowest seeing 6,175 yuan. The noon closing was still stable at 6,200 yuan. The market trend improved in the afternoon, and the floating air compensated. The initial opening was 6,220 yuan, and it improved to 6,240 yuan twice. As a result, it closed at 6,223 yuan, a drop of 57 yuan compared to the previous Saturday. The total transaction volume was around 4,000 taels. Silver jewelry remained unchanged, and customs gold remained flat.

Gold Fell by 57 Yuan

In the early morning, the exchange market was slightly weak, but people's hearts were divided. The gold companies had a strong desire to sell, which caused the price to rise. First, the gold companies did each other 20 taels, still at 6,280 yuan, without distinction between honor and disgrace compared to the weekend. After the opening, the money exchange industry slightly entered, once raising it to 6,290 yuan, but after that, the gold companies supported it, and a certain silver company violently stuffed it, selling short on behalf of customers. In addition, the exchange market soon hardened, and there were rumors of some negative news. Although a certain money exchange industry and the silver companies absorbed it in the middle, it immediately fell back to 6,240 yuan. Although it stood firm and hovered between 6,250 and 6,260 yuan, it eventually fell miserably into the 6,200 yuan mark due to the gold companies selling more and more vigorously. The silver companies did each other 30 taels, losing to 6,175 yuan. At noon, the number of sellers decreased, and a certain money exchange industry spared no effort to come to hold again. Before closing, it once rose back to 6,210 yuan, but the closing was ultimately 6,200 yuan. After the market opened in the afternoon, people's hearts turned slightly, and it immediately rose up under the buying wind.

Phone 91121 91626

Twenty yuan, the gold company entered the silver company with 20 taels, for 6,220 yuan. Later, after the gold company covered its short position, it rose to 6,240 yuan again. After that, the multi-party of a certain money exchange industry slightly withdrew. In addition, the gold companies came to sell at this time, and it fell slightly to 6,205 yuan. The exchange market then softened slightly, and there was also news of some positive news in Vietnam, and it rose again to 6,240 yuan. After entering, retail investors and silver companies spit it out, and by closing it was 6,223 yuan. As a result, it fell by 57 yuan compared to the previous day. The total daily fluctuation was 115 yuan. The selling price of the current gold standard card of the cash company is more than ten yuan higher according to the feverfew, and the purchase is reduced by thirty yuan. The current margin is more than fifty yuan lower than the listed gold, and there are few openings.

Jewelry Gold Has Not Been Listed

The exchange of silver jewelry is still unchanged. Datonghang still hangs the original price of 640 yuan. The new trade is similar to the upper price, and the purchase is reduced by about thirty yuan.

### Legal Tender Falls Consistently

Yesterday's foreign currency market, due to the feverfew hovering downward, the British and American gold pounds also fell by 1.5 yuan each. The demand for British gold notes decreased slightly, and the market price decreased slightly by 0.25 yuan. The US gold notes rose and fell sharply. In the early morning, it once rose to 19 yuan, but due to rumors that the United States, China, and the Soviet Union had concluded a military alliance, the supply from all parties was abundant, and it once fell back to 18.67 yuan, eventually becoming 18.74 yuan, a drop of 0.16 yuan compared to the previous Saturday. The demand for Hong Kong notes was relatively sluggish, and the market price was slightly soft. The Japanese gold notes initially continued to rise, but fell in the afternoon, eventually falling by 0.01 yuan. The evening market fell back to 1.51 yuan. The supply of Korean notes was slightly strong, and the market price was slightly soft. The evening market fell back to 1.17 yuan.

### Call Loan Rate Continues to Rise by One Cent, Frequent Small Transactions

Yesterday's exchange draft discount rate did not stop falling, but instead expanded. In the morning, the discount rate was 20 yuan per thousand yuan for buying in and 23 yuan for selling out. In the afternoon, it continued to fall to 22 yuan, with the discount rate for buying in only 20 yuan, a decrease of 2 yuan compared to the previous Saturday. The call loan rate of the Money Industry Association continued to rise by 0.01 yuan, reaching 0.12 yuan.

### Food, Foreign Rice Arrives in an Endless Stream, Rice Merchants Take the Opportunity to Exaggerate

Yesterday, foreign rice was affected by the expansion of the Vietnam issue. The shippers took the opportunity to promote and raise prices, and the blindly following floating households rushed to absorb it. The scalping trade also emerged as a result. Therefore, the price of foreign rice in the early market soared by as much as 2 yuan. The profit-taking bulls then came out, and the afternoon market recovered by 1 yuan. As a result, it was only about 1 yuan higher. Annam japonica was surprisingly idle at 70.5 yuan. However, English and Chinese Company's original package No. 2 Saigon took the opportunity to rise to 77 yuan, and No. 2 Siam rose to 76.5 yuan, with more than 100 tons of transactions. There was active speculation in spot, with transactions reaching 8,000 to 9,000 bags.

The source of foreign rice is continuous. The Taikoo Company's Jinan wheel arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday (Sunday) with 6,471 bags loaded from Hong Kong and stopped at the company's wharf in the French Concession to unload. The unloading was completed yesterday (rent).

The source of glutinous rice was blocked, and there was a slight exhortation on this street. The market added a yuan or so. Kaijin Litte was 70 yuan to 68.2 yuan, Changdan white was 69.5 yuan to 68 yuan, Hong Kong special was 69.5 yuan to 68 yuan. The source of thick and thin broken japonica and other national rice continued to be blocked. Because foreign rice was seen to be firm and the actual sales moved slightly, the market price rose by nearly a yuan. It is estimated that Kaichang special japonica was 79.6 yuan to 78 yuan, ordinary was 76.7 yuan, Wuchang Su Kun japonica was 78 yuan, decided to 74.8 yuan, Qingpu thin broken was 79 yuan to 78 yuan, Nangang early broken original package was 76 yuan to 75.5 yuan, and Hu Jian was 73.5 yuan to 73 yuan.

The sources of new japonica tips from various routes in the past two days, transported out by water and land, were 4,500 to 6,000 bags. Because the actual forceps were quite expensive, the market price jumped by 2 or 3 yuan. Kai Dongxin was 74 yuan to 72 yuan, West Xinhao was 77 yuan and decided to 72 yuan, Taicang Jiading Sheep tip original package was 65.5 yuan, Hu Jianhao was 63 yuan to 64 yuan, and Xiang japonica was 78.5 yuan.

### Flour Rises Again: New High Price Seen at $18; 17,000 Tons of Foreign Wheat Arrive

The flour market was increasingly tight yesterday. Due to strong sales, the available supply of spot goods fell short of demand. Second-grade flour from reputable mills increased by another half dollar, to $16.50. Mill and warehouse stocks were absorbed by囤戶, and the supply of筹码 was depleted, creating a new high peak of $18. Both rice and flour are trending higher. Due to difficulties in transporting flour into the concessions, the supply of Japanese-made flour is dwindling daily, and futures trading remains suspended. A large quantity of foreign flour is being transshipped to North China, and local Shanghai flour stocks are being hoarded for profit. The prices of 洋砲台 and 福壽 brands are approaching the $19 mark, and the market's upward trend is just beginning. Yesterday's wheat trading was not brisk, as supplies from the interior have been scarce for some time, and Shanghai's reserves are also low. Sellers are holding firm to their intentions, but Japanese mills show little interest in importing. As Chinese mills have foreign wheat arriving that they contracted for themselves, they are not urgently in need. Therefore, the market saw no major developments. It is heard that Japanese and Chinese mills each took in two to three thousand bags of wheat, and the selling price was slightly firmer than before.

A large amount of foreign wheat continuously arrives in Shanghai. The Norwegian vessel Vito, managed by 天祥洋行, arrived from Australia with over 8,000 tons last Tuesday (the 17th), berthed at buoys 14 and 15 for unloading. It is expected to be cleared today. Yesterday, the firm's Astorla, also from Australia with over 8,000 bags, arrived in Shanghai at around 5 p.m., berthed at buoy 809, and unloading will begin today. The two ships carry a total of 17,000 tons. (祖)

### Securities: French Indochina Yields to Japan; Foreign Stock Prices Soar; Domestic Bonds Frequently See Increases

The over-the-counter securities market continued its upward trend yesterday. However, it briefly declined slightly in the afternoon due to unfounded rumors, but overall sentiment remained very strong. Major players only increased their holdings, while retail investors often showed signs of cashing out, making the market very stable. In terms of news, economic and material assistance to China from Britain, America, and the Soviet Union is becoming more robust, and new routes for China's foreign transportation are being created. However, the biggest factor is still the pain of being unable to use the excessive floating capital, which has gone from abundant to overflowing. The reduction of bank deposit interest rates is a clear indication of this. A portion of this floating capital has already been invested in government bonds. The cultivation of this strength is sure to make the public bonds prosperous. Yesterday morning, the 25th issue was the most actively bought. Heng Fu and Run De also had quite strong demand. There were also many sporadic purchases from retail investors. Lian Yi and Yong Feng saw some profit-taking. Tong Kang sold first and then bought, and the market price at the midday close was bullish, fluctuating widely. The opening in the afternoon was very firm. The third installment once hit six yuan, but later, as retail investors rushed to sell and Lian Yi and Jiu Feng resumed profit-taking, the 25th issue was consistently bought. Tong Shun also saw heated demand for both the 丙戍 types. The market was relatively weaker in the afternoon, but the 戊 and 丁 types continued to strengthen, resulting in a continued increase of 23 to 55 cents. The total number of transactions was over $1.2 million. A concise table is listed below.

In stock trading, 45 shares of the 中華書局 stock were traded at a price of $31.50 per share.

The stock market at the 衆業公所 opened yesterday and did not place much emphasis on the Japanese army's entry into Vietnam. Prices were remarkably stable. Later, because of the news that France and Japan had reached an agreement in Hanoi, buyers took the opportunity to engage in large-scale activity, and the prices of various stocks soared to new highs not seen in a long time. The vigor of the Xin He Cotton Mill shares benefited the entire market. The stock initially traded around $7.20 in the morning, and large quantities of orders came in, which were fully absorbed. It turned upward in the afternoon, closing at a high price of $8.45. Although rubber shares were not as vigorous as industrial shares, they were also remarkably firm. The total transaction volume of various stocks yesterday was the largest it had been in a long time.

London, 20th (Friday) (Delayed Dispatch): Listed prices of Chinese foreign bonds and Far Eastern British company stocks are flat, with no changes in market conditions.

The dividend and bonus of 冠生園 for 1928 totals 1.2% per annum.

### Yarn and Cotton: Assembled Yarn Sales Continue Smoothly in Hong Kong

The yarn market situation is still rising, but although there is no shortage of new buyers, most transactions are based on the idea of scalping, so the situation is superficially very firm, but in reality, there is not much strength. Because prices are slightly higher, profits are quickly taken, and as soon as holdings loosen, the market quickly falls; conversely, it rises. However, currently, Hong Kong's demand is continuous, and all parties are strongly motivated. Around 1,000 bales are bought each day, but most of them are specified brands of yarn.

The morning opening of spot yarn was still benign. 20-count Double Horse opened at $1,013. A little later, scalpers rushed in, and because gold prices were high, it rose to $1,018. This price fluctuated for a long time. Because spot sales to Hong Kong were still 1,000 bales, and coarse yarn prices were very tight, the market price was firm, and the trading floor was very lively. The closing price was $1,016. Unexpectedly, gold prices suddenly fell after the close, and sentiment became slightly weak, falling by $6 or $7. The Double Horse price was $1,010. Statistics show that 2,685 bales were traded in half a day. The market for 10-count Double Horse was flat. Yesterday, 10 lots of cotton yarn were exported to Hong Kong, and 455 lots were shipped to Siam. Today, 955 lots are still being shipped to Hong Kong and 85 lots to Xiamen. The amounts bought by each trading group are listed below:

Hong Kong: 095, Other traders: 1580

Total: 2685

### Cotton Turns Upward, with Long-Staple Fiber Particularly Popular

Although there are no batch transactions in the spot cotton business, market sentiment is tighter than before. This is because although the new cotton crop year is bountiful, the source is unreliable, so cotton merchants have a good attitude. However, the yarn market still lacks upward momentum, and factories are not absorbing high prices. Only trading among merchants is picking up, and selling prices have not changed much.

In other news, New York cotton prices initially fell due to a lack of major buyers and then because of good weather in cotton-growing areas, resulting in closing prices falling by 35 points compared to the previous day. Yesterday, India, including forecasts, was up around half a rupee.

In the Shanghai foreign cotton trade, there is a current shortage of long-staple fiber spot goods in the market, but there are many inquiries for 32-count cotton yarn. Factories therefore intend to buy this raw cotton, so it has been very popular in recent days. The merchants are well aware that the arrival of raw cotton is becoming increasingly scarce, and their sentiments are firm, with a consensus that the cotton market will rise.

### Piece Goods: Yarn Prices Rise, Cloth Mill Quotes Increase

National Cloth: Yesterday, the national cloth market benefited from the rising price of raw yarn, which affected costs, and the factory quotations gradually tightened. However, current sales still lack large-scale development, and sporadic transactions are still lively. Selling prices for coarse and fine cloth and twill cloth rose by 12 cents, while colored cloth and colored twill rose by 25 to 50 cents. Bleached cloth, printed cloth, and velvet cloth were flat. More than 500 pieces of various cloths were transacted on this street. Guangdong and Hong Kong traders transacted over 300 pieces of colored cloth, colored twill, coarse cloth, and twill cloth. Zhejiang and Fujian traders transacted over 100 pieces of colored twill and coarse cloth, and northern traders from Yantai and Qingdao transacted over 100 pieces of assembled cloth, velvet cloth, and woolen cloth.

Eastern Cloth: Yesterday, dyeing and sales activities on this street were active, and selling prices continued to rise. Among the white goods, medium and lower-grade fine cloth and fine twill suddenly rose by 50 to 75 cents per piece. Abe & Co. set the price for 12-pound Yang He fine cloth at $28 per piece. The price of Dragon Head fine cloth in the morning market softened due to the decline in gold prices, falling to $32.75. Later, the market rose to $32.90 due to good prices for medium-grade goods. Four Gentlemen Serge was 94 cents, while the Zhigong允缺佾 was already being quoted at over $1 per yard.

Exports: A check of the piece goods shipped to other ports shows that 105 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong on the 13th, and another 140 pieces were shipped to Siam. Today, there are also 245 pieces shipped to Xiamen, 405 pieces to Hong Kong, and 41 pieces to Singapore.

### Sugar Market: Sugar Prices Fluctuate Slightly

Yesterday's sugar market trend was stable, with both increases and decreases, but the amounts were not large. The 公會's quoted price for spot goods in the 24 group white stock was $80.05, up one cent. Old goods were $78.50, new foreign stock was $80, and transshipment goods were soft at $64. Dutch cotton white TML mark was $77.20, down one cent; KD mark was $76. Dutch red was initially $62.90 to $63, and later $63.30. Tai Ku car white B mark was $77.50, down five cents; DY mark was $75 to $75.50, up five cents; HX mark was $75 to $75.40, up four cents. Our factory's 晶明 rock sugar was $99, up $1.50. On the 23rd, 120 bags of sugar arrived from Hong Kong, and 200 bags from Xiamen.

### Oilseed Cake: Speculation in Edible Oil Focuses on Futures

Yesterday, the oil market was mediocre, and the source was still connected. Spot oil sales were not smooth, but most players are focused on futures speculation, so the market is slightly tighter in the later stages. A total of 110 lots of Jiaozhou soybean oil were opened at a price of $73. 50 lots of Yantai soybean oil were priced at $75.9. 600担 of Dalian pure soybean oil were priced at $80. 300 担 of Da You Factory soybean oil were priced at $81 to $81.50. 250 lots of Jiaozhou raw oil were priced at $67.50 to $68.50. 200 lots of road goods were priced at $67.75. 800 lots for October delivery were priced at $67.50 to $68.75. 900 lots for late October delivery were priced at $68.75 to $70. 50 lots of Yantai raw oil were $67. 130 barrels of Qingdao raw oil were priced at $94.50 to $95.

On the 23rd, 700 pieces of bean cake were shipped to Siam.

### The Pitiful Old Prisoner

— Ji Cao

When I was in eastern Zhejiang, I lived at my friend Lawyer Zhang's house. Because I often went with him to the court to observe, I learned quite a few legal stories. One day, I saw an old prisoner attempting to escape from prison. In his "unfortunate fate," his father was caught by the police; now, he was being forced by his father to let the judge add a charge of "fugitive" to his crimes.

The scene was truly unbearable to witness. Who could have guessed what crime that pitiful old prisoner had committed? His hair was almost completely white, deep wrinkles ran across his forehead, his eyes were so vacant, and his entire weak and frail body trembled. He scanned his surroundings with pleading eyes, and anyone would have been willing to return a sympathetic look of pity.

Now, the esteemed person sitting on the high platform began the interrogation:

"Why? Why? Tell me, why did you try to escape from prison?"

The pitiful old prisoner could only manage to tremble. Though his lips seemed to move slightly, no one could hear his answer, and of course, the judge was no exception.

"Do you know that you are now subject to two legal penalties? First, you committed murder; second, you committed attempted prison escape. Can you tell me if you are dissatisfied with the penalties the law has given you?"

The old prisoner still did not answer. He now felt he had lost all hope and simply hung his head. The judge seemed moved by the scene and did not scold the old prisoner as he would other criminals. He simply gazed at the old prisoner with a compassionate and pitying look. After about three minutes, he turned to my friend Lawyer Zhang and said:

"Now, the appointed defense counsel can make a statement! The poor old man no longer has the strength to speak."

My friend stood up solemnly.

"This lawyer hopes that the court can allow the defendant to return home once. The reason the defendant attempted to escape was because he could not bear to leave behind a young grandson at home. This request was previously brought up by this lawyer but was rejected by the court due to the seriousness of the case, leading to this escape attempt. Therefore, this lawyer still hopes that the court will allow the defendant to return home once. If he attempts to flee, this lawyer is willing to bear all responsibility. As for the legal penalties, this lawyer has no objection."

The old prisoner seemed to hear my friend's words. He slowly raised his head, again with pleading eyes, looking at the esteemed judge above, as if waiting for the judge's pity.

Now the old prisoner had his wish fulfilled. His pitiful situation had also moved the judge, who had specially allowed him to return home once; however, he was given a deadline of two days. My friend was also willing to help him. He gave the old prisoner five yuan and also hired a black awning boat for the old prisoner, sending him onto the boat. The boatman pushed the oar with his foot, and the boat cut through the water, flying away.

My friend and I watched the distant silhouette of the departing black awning boat, both of us controlled by emotion, speechless, watching the boat go further and further away, disappearing behind the mountains.

"Shi, do you also think this old prisoner is pitiful?" my friend turned to me and said;

"Yes, he is truly pitiful!" We slowly walked back home: "But I don't believe he committed murder. What kind of thing is murder?"

"Alas!" My friend sighed deeply and said: "How can it not be? Who can believe that this old man would have the heart to kill someone? This matter is truly tragic."

My friend paused, and continued: "Initially, this old man was a lonely old man. He had a married daughter who suffered the tragedy of losing her husband; his daughter, for the sake of livelihood, had no choice but to leave her two children with this pitiful old man, and went to Shanghai alone to find work. Originally, this old man lived by begging; now, suddenly adding two young grandchildren, they often went hungry. They managed to get through two months like this. Now, the whole county is experiencing a rice shortage, and one yuan can only buy a little over two sheng of rice. Sometimes, even with money, there is nowhere to exchange for rice. No one is willing to give away their pearl-like rice to the poor. Therefore, this pitiful old man and his two grandchildren often went hungry for several days. The children don't understand, and when they are hungry, they make a fuss with their grandfather. Forced by this, one morning, he held one of his grandchildren

Hawthorne's Detective Cases

### The Dancer's Fate

— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter 7: "Take Him Away"

The light inside was not very bright, and I couldn't see much. As I straightened up, I suddenly heard a faint footstep on the carpet. Looking back, I saw a woman walking from the west. I casually turned around, walked back, and brushed past the woman. Her eyes were looking at the room numbers, clearly not paying attention to me. I looked back and saw her enter room 554. When I returned to the entrance of the corridor, I saw A-Gen from room 71 in a close conversation with another short waiter. A-Gen also saw me but didn't greet me, only shook his head slightly. I knew that was the signal that Zhao Boxiong wasn't inside. That short waiter from room 54 must be Little Li. He also glanced at me, clearly A-Gen had introduced me to him.

When I returned to the stairwell, Hawthorne was coming down from the sixth floor. I also shook my head at him. Hawthorne, seeing that there was no one around, whispered to me.

"It's good that he's not in the room. I want to go in and take a look first. But you don't need to come in. It's best to find a suitable place to wait. In case he suddenly returns, we two can respond from inside and outside."

I agreed. Hawthorne walked to the two waiters. A-Gen, seeing Hawthorne, shook his head again as before, then turned towards the stairwell. Hawthorne whispered something in Little Li's ear, and Little Li followed us. Hawthorne looked at the room numbers along the way, and when he reached the second turn, he nudged me with his mouth. I immediately stopped, letting Little Li go ahead with Hawthorne. This location was the only way to reach room 556. Not far from this turn, there was a window. I leaned against this window. I felt this location wasn't very convenient. If I stood still, people would easily become suspicious. But I couldn't choose a more suitable position.

After a while, Little Li returned. He had opened room 556 for Hawthorne and retreated alone. I walked to the turn and saw that Hawthorne had indeed gone in, and the door was closed. But when I looked back again, I saw someone in the distance swaying towards us from the first turn of the corridor. The person was still far away, and although I couldn't see clearly, I estimated his silhouette to be Zhao Boxiong. (116) , and threw himself into the river to commit suicide. Fortunately, a passerby saw it and rescued the old man; at first, no one noticed that there was a small child who hadn't been rescued until the old man woke up and cried out for his grandson. Only then did they retrieve the child's body from the river. That's how the old man committed murder and was imprisoned. Now, his attempt to escape was because he couldn't bear to leave his other grandson at home; unfortunately, he also incurred a charge of being a fugitive. Alas! Truly tragic."

"Truly tragic!" I was deeply moved by this tragic story, and so was my friend. We walked in silence.

Self-Cultivation

### Blind Worship

— Liu Jiagan

We often hear people quoting the words of ancient famous people and sages to criticize others, to overturn their theories and implement their own views. If others resist even slightly, they will loudly scold: "Hey! This is what the ancients said!" In this way, others may retreat in silence, but they have not considered whether the words of the ancients are still suitable for reality, whether they have far deviated from or distorted everything reflected by this forward-moving era. They only think that the words of the ancients are all "golden rules" and are definitely not wrong. This kind of worship is blind. They forget that before worship, they must add a modern critical perspective. The era is constantly advancing, and there is no reason why the thoughts of the ancients thousands of years ago can be completely applied to reality.

### Unable to Multitask and Unable to Live

— Written by Yan Fan

Let's take an example: there is a gentleman who, whenever he sees someone napping during the day, shakes his head and sighs: "Rotten wood cannot be carved." The reason is that Confucius once said this, so of course, all those who nap during the day are "rotten wood" and "walls of dung." He doesn't know that the medical community has proven that short daytime naps are sufficient to restore physical fatigue, and many important people who are constantly burdened with mental and physical labor have this habit. In this way, rotten wood is no longer "rotten," and walls are no longer in the category of "dung."

We cannot blindly worship the words and deeds of the ancients unless we have examined them first. Here, I also need to quote a sentence from an ancient person. Roger Bacon in the thirteenth century said: "People should not blindly follow after Aristotle, but need to accumulate experience for themselves." Another Bacon (Francis Bacon), in the seventeenth century, also said: "One cannot say that something is right simply because someone else has said it before; one must rely on one's own eyes to observe whether it is so." From this, it can be seen that blind worship was already disdained by the ancients and is not a "product" that only exists in modern times!

Therefore, we should not only blindly worship the words and thoughts of the ancients, but we need to add a new and powerful critical perspective. We should retain the valuable things that cater to the times and continue to worship and praise them. As for some corrupt, outdated, and erroneous ideas, we will abandon them without hesitation! Friends, you should know that the era of blind conservatism is no longer here.

### Fine

— Translated by Su Fu

Once, a pickpocket was caught in the act of stealing. The police took him to court, and the judge's verdict was a fine of fifty yuan.

However, the police searched the pickpocket and found only thirty yuan in total. So the police said to the judge: "He cannot pay so much of a fine. Can it be reduced to a fine of thirty yuan?"

The judge replied to the police: "Then you should release the pickpocket and let him go to the busy street. You follow him from behind, don't let him slip away. Bring him back in an hour. The fine of fifty yuan is not reducible."

Entertainment World

### Characteristics of Shanghai Cinemas

— Luo Cun

Shanghai cinemas all have their own characteristics. The twenty-two listed here can be compared, but this is a subjective opinion.

(1) Grand Cathay has "translated meaning style," which is its only unique feature.

(2) Nanjing Hollywood handles all the imported racy films in Shanghai.

(3) Cathay has specially assigned police officers to direct traffic when the show ends, and Mears Road is closed to all vehicles in the middle section.

(4) The Grand Shanghai is in charge of re-releasing blockbusters.

(5) The pageboys employed at the entrance and exit of Dahua are the smallest among Shanghai cinemas but provide the most loyal service.

(6) The height difference between the front and back rows of seats in the Huguang downstairs is its biggest feature.

(7) The lighting installation in the entire Jincheng cinema is in rectangular glass boxes, which is quite unique.

(8) There are two ticket entrances in the main hall of Xinguang. All others only have one.

(9) The arrangement of seats in the main hall of Lido is staggered, so every seat does not obstruct the audience's view.

(10) The upper and lower seats of Guanglu are all leather cushions, which can be called aristocratic.

(11) At Jinmen, after each screening of advertisement slides, a reporter reports on the next film, which is also a unique feature.

(12) The main hall seats in Paris are divided into rattan cushions and leather cushions, which are very comfortable.

(13) The shape of the entire Central cinema is like a fan.

(14) The entrance and exit of Ping An have no doors and are open day and night. If there is a crowd, there is no way to "pull down the iron gate."

(15) The entrances to all the Dumei cinemas are located behind the cinema, but Dumei's is located in the middle.

(16) The screen of the Lafayette cinema is the largest in Shanghai.

(17) There is no cinema in Shanghai with lighting darker than Zhejiang's.

(18) Before the show starts at Amon (during the day), there is not a single electric light on in the cinema. It relies entirely on natural sunlight from outside, which is extremely economical.

(19) The balcony of Mingxing is semicircular, which is not found in other cinemas.

(20) At the beginning of the show at Xihai, a person always appears in front of the screen to pull the curtain.

(21) The balcony of Jiuxing is extremely low. You can't find another one like it anywhere in Shanghai.

(22) The balcony seats in Shanxi are very small but very clean.

In addition, the Empire, Carde, Carlton, and the newly reorganized open-air cinema are not purely showing movies. Sometimes they also perform Peking opera and Yue opera, so they are not included.

### Island Theater Talk

— Wei Wei

Li Shengzao, Tong Zhiling, and their group of actors will stop on Double Ten Day. As for the team following Li Shengzao, it was previously said to be Xin Yanqiu, Li Hezeng, Yu Zhenfei, Ru Fulan, and Hou Xirui, but after the reporter inquired with Golden, there have been some small changes. Li Hezeng, the male performer originally scheduled to be invited, has now been replaced by Zhou Xiaotian·Wei Wei·. At the same time, Hou Xirui, the famous Jing performer whom the audience has been eagerly awaiting, has reportedly cancelled his trip to Shanghai.

There is a small reason for Hou Xirui's cancellation. Because Xirui's expenses and package fees are high, and Xin Yanqiu's plays don't require Xirui in many places. If Xirui is asked to sing a solo performance every day, time would not allow it, and there would also be problems with the play schedule. In addition, Yu Zhenfei was "invited firmly with friendship," and Yu Zhenfei is giving Golden face and not counting package fees. Because of this relationship, it is planned to put Yu Zhenfei in the third position and martial artist Ru Fulan in the fourth position. If Xirui is put in the fifth position, it would not be appropriate. Therefore, for various reasons, Golden has given up on Xirui for the next lineup and plans to invite him and his old partner Zhou Ruian to come together after Xin Yanqiu. The Jing role will then be filled by Qiu Shengrong. The major comic roles will still be Sun Shengwu, and Guan Shengxi will also continue. As for martial artist Ru Fulan, the official matter has been settled, and he is scheduled to come south with Xin Yanqiu. Ru Fulan's masterpieces, "Exploring the Village," "Night Flight," and "Eight Great Hammers," have long been known to people in Shanghai and will surely be a big draw. Coupled with Xin Yanqiu and Yu Zhenfei's collaborative plays, it is expected that the performances will be a grand occasion.

### Film World Jottings

— Xin Fang

Olivia de Havilland and James Stewart will soon have good news to announce. Regarding her sister Joan Fontaine, everyone unanimously predicts that she will become a red star on the silver screen in the shortest possible time.

Deanna Durbin recently received several interesting letters from Japan, requesting her not to kiss any men in her starring films in the future.

Since the outbreak of the European War, Hollywood's overseas markets have disappeared by forty percent. Now, the only remaining countries are in South America. For this reason, film merchants have decided to produce several films featuring South American heroes such as Simon Bolivar in this year's filming plan.

We all know that Shirley Temple's departure from the silver screen is because she wants to go to school. However, there is another rumor in the film city recently, saying that it is because she and her parents are not satisfied with the content of the scripts that the company assigns her to star in.

This autumn is the time for the US presidential election, and the entire film city is unfolding a lively situation for this event. It is said that a large number of film stars support Roosevelt's re-election.

Marlene Dietrich was recently selected by an American magazine as the most beautiful woman on the silver screen, while Glan Ziaren was selected by psychology students at a certain university as the female star most suitable for starring in Western films.

### The Kissing Art of Male and Female Stars—One of the Silver Screen Kiss Talks—

— Xin Ying

Regarding kissing on the silver screen, this magazine has had several reports. In the eyes of people in Hollywood, kissing is also an important art when filming. What this article wants to say is the kissing techniques of several major male and female stars in Hollywood.

(1) Male Stars

When Gary Cooper kisses female stars, he seems crazy in some films. Sometimes he kisses very sincerely, able to concentrate on his work and do it as if it were a real thing.

Jack Oakie kisses the lightest among the male stars in Hollywood, almost making the female star unaware that she is kissing.

George Raft is the complete opposite of Jack Oakie. His kisses are the heaviest. Several female stars don't like to kiss him.

William Powell lets every female star in Hollywood know how sweet it is to kiss him.

(2) Female Stars

Mae West is the most passionate when kissing on the silver screen. When she kisses, her head seems to be placed on the man's body, without gaps or turns, and she doesn't kiss like a flyover. There are no shortcomings that can be pointed out.

Jean Harlow only uses a part of her lips when she kisses, which is very gentle. But her kissing scenes often have to be reshot.

When Joan Crawford kisses, her head moves, and she smears her lipstick on the man's lips from right to left.

Claudette Colbert's kisses are full of flirtatious colors. There is no fixed method, and the male star who kisses her is almost anesthetized.

### Jindu Grand Theatre Opens on Christmas Day

Jindu Grand Theatre was founded by the Liu brothers and others. It was originally scheduled to open at the same time as Guolian after the Mid-Autumn Festival, but because the work started later and the project was huge, it is now under construction. It is rumored that it will open on Double Ten Day, but this may not be possible. The reporter received reliable news from related parties that the theater wants to make it the ideal cinema, so it must be postponed until Christmas to officially open.

### Introducing the US Navy Band

— Xu Wu Huan

The US Navy Band has been in Shanghai for six years. Every Sunday, they hold concerts at the Grand Cathay Theatre, sharing their superb skills with the Chinese people, "to introduce art and to connect feelings." The bandleader, Mr. Giffin (L.E. Giffin), and the band conductor, Mr. Rauhof (J.P. Rauhof), are both outstanding musicians who have a good impression of the Chinese people. Although the program of their concerts is determined by them, they are quite willing to accept external requests. If Chinese people want to ask them to play a certain piece, they can send a letter in advance, stating the name of the piece and the author, and they will definitely play it within the possible range. Moreover, the concert does not sell tickets. Those who love noble art are invited to listen quietly at the Grand Cathay Theatre before 10:00 am every Sunday.

The team is full of talent and has recently been greatly expanded. The number of members has increased to thirty-nine. The attached picture shows their new lineup.

(The person sitting in the middle of the front row in the attached picture: Mr. Giffin on the right, Mr. Rauhof on the left.)
