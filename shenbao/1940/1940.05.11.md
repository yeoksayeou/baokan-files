### Hitler Personally Goes to the Front Lines to Supervise the Battle; Issues Message to All Soldiers

German Supreme Headquarters: Dispatches from here state that, in view of the enemy's direct expansion of the war to the territories of Belgium and the Netherlands, and because the Ruhr area is threatened, German forces on the Western Front crossed the western border and launched an attack at dawn this morning. At the same time, German air forces attacked enemy air force bases and assisted the army in fighting the enemy. Head of State Hitler, in his capacity as Supreme Commander, has gone to the front lines in person. (Haitong dispatch, 10th)

Berlin: Head of State Hitler issued an important message today, as follows: Soldiers on the Western Front, the final moment of deciding Germany's future has arrived. In other words, the time for the decisive battle has come. For three hundred years, the rulers of Britain and France have aimed to prevent Germany from truly uniting, and they have especially wanted to suppress Germany to keep it permanently weak and powerless. France has always had this ambition, so it has declared war on Germany thirty-one times in the past two hundred years. The British authorities have repeatedly hindered Germany's unity and have also prevented Germany from obtaining the resources to maintain the welfare and life of 80 million people. Regardless of the political system of the countries at the time, Britain implemented this continuing policy, and the target they wanted to attack was the German people. The people governing Britain and France have now openly admitted their goal: to divide Germany into several small countries. If they are allowed to achieve their goal, Germany will not only lose its political power but also lose the right to defend the survival of the German people in the world. The German people have no animosity towards the people of Britain and France, but because it is a matter of life and death today, the responsibility of self-defense cannot be shirked. In the past few weeks, German troops, driven by righteous indignation, have taken the lead in defeating the pawns of Britain and France. Now that Poland is pacified, Germany has no worries in the East. Britain and France decided to attack Germany from the north. But since April 9th, this conspiracy has also been destroyed by German troops. Recently, France attempted to divert our attention to Southeast Europe and secretly plotted to attack the Ruhr through the Netherlands and Belgium. Their intentions can be described as treacherous. Soldiers on the Western Front, the time has come. The struggle that begins today will determine the fate of Germany and the German people for thousands of years to come. May all our soldiers strive and work hard for the country and the nation. The entire people are behind you. May victory be with you. (Haitong dispatch, 10th)

### German Military Report

Berlin: Official dispatches this afternoon stated that several squadrons of the German Air Force landed at airfields in Belgium and the Netherlands at dawn this morning, carrying soldiers. These airfields and the surrounding areas were quickly brought under military control. Military airfields in eastern and central France were also bombed and set on fire by German aircraft, causing considerable damage. The airfields of Saint-Omer, Vitry, Le Francoeur, and Meaux suffered the most damage and have been destroyed. After the Belgian government requested British and French troops to enter Belgium, and the Dutch government declared war on Germany, the scope of German air strikes has been expanded. Military targets in the Netherlands and Belgium are also included in their attacks. The airfields of Antwerp and Brussels were bombed by German aircraft. One of Belgium's strongest fortresses has been captured by German troops. The German Air Force's highly effective cooperation with the Army is the main reason for their success. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 10th)

### German Troops Dress in Dutch Uniforms to Invade Netherlands

Berlin Denies Allegations

London: Dutch Radio announced that since 8:00 AM this morning, German troops have been continuously parachuting into the Netherlands, and their numbers are increasing. It is now confirmed that these German troops are wearing Dutch uniforms. (Reuters dispatch, 10th)

Berlin: Senior German generals declared today that the allegations in foreign newspapers that the German Air Force's parachute troops are wearing Dutch uniforms are completely untrue. Soldiers of all German units will continue to wear the uniforms of their respective units, and all soldiers have been instructed not to wear civilian clothes while on duty. There is no plan to change uniforms. (Haitong dispatch, 10th)

Editorial

### The High Cost of Medicine and the Public's Health

From rice and grains to fuel and cloth, everything is hoarded by speculators and manipulated by merchants, causing prices to skyrocket and greatly impacting people's livelihoods. Those who rely on their physical labor, even if they are fortunate enough to have a healthy appetite, find that their hard work is not enough to cover their basic needs of food and clothing. Unfortunately, if they fall ill, the cost of medicine has also risen along with everything else, making it almost impossible for ordinary patients to afford it. Western medicines, in particular, are mostly manufactured in England, America, Germany, and France. Since the outbreak of the European war, medicines have also become a target for speculation. Some are locked away, waiting for even better prices to be offered; others are treated as rare commodities, with prices soaring by 30-50% or even doubling depending on the exchange rate of the day. Chinese medicines mostly come from the mainland, and price increases have their own reasons. Alas, the torment of both physical illness and economic hardship is forcing people to their limits. The suffering of patients is unimaginable!

People cannot avoid getting sick: especially when the cost of living is high, nutrition cannot be as adequate as usual, and living conditions are not as spacious as usual. Illnesses are easily contracted; this is both reasonable and inevitable. It is inevitable to have diseases, and the price of medicine is so expensive; therefore, to preserve life and restore the ability to work and produce, one has no choice but to endure the pain and pay the price. Even with tonics: it seems that those with financial resources can afford them, and those without financial resources can do without them. Since doing without tonics does not harm one's life, it is acceptable to view tonics as a luxury consumption. However, after a serious illness, if the necessary tonics are not given, the illness will not easily heal, health will not easily recover, and one may even suffer for life. Thus, tonics cannot be entirely classified as luxuries. Tonics aside, if ordinary medicines needed to treat illnesses have the most direct relationship with human life and death, but with today's medicine prices, filling a prescription or buying a medicine can cost ten or more gold coins, or even dozens of gold coins. The question then becomes whether one wants to live or not, and whether one has the money or not? If one has no money, one can only wait to die. Indeed, with the difficulty of living today, coupled with the hardship of illness and the expense of medicine, those who live paycheck to paycheck will rely on their existing resistance to ward off the devil of disease. Even middle-class families, if they happen to have a sick person, will be at a loss, not knowing what to do; unable to afford a doctor or medicine, children crying from hunger, family members weeping in silence. Those confined to a sickbed will find this situation unbearable. If they are unwilling to sit and wait for death, they can only suffer the pressure of material hardship and ultimately find it impossible to survive. Such tragic scenes are common throughout society.

The importance of medicine is the same as that of beans, wheat, rice, and cloth. Beans, wheat, rice, and cloth nourish life, while medicine protects life. What we expect of the pharmaceutical industry today is nothing extravagant: only that they value human life, do not engage in hoarding, restrict the supply of stockpiles, do not allow medicines to become stagnant, and do not allow medicine prices to rise sharply. We also hope that public associations will take a position of righteousness, lead the industry, and set prices according to normal standards, carefully avoiding burdening patients with sudden fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. In particular, the prices of medicines necessary for general treatment, which are not tonics, should be jointly maintained at a fair level. If the source of medicines is disrupted or even interrupted due to the war, it is hoped that doctors and pharmacists will strive to research and develop new medicines in a timely manner, utilizing the strengths of domestic medicines and using native medicinal materials, based on science and with reference to established formulas, so as to meet urgent needs. In terms of business, this can make up for the lack of imported goods; and in terms of medicine and pharmacy, it can also make many contributions to this great era. In the so-called total mobilization during wartime, scientists play a very important role. Chinese medicine, on the one hand, follows Europe and America, and indeed there is a sense of being unable to catch up; on the other hand, it should also humbly acknowledge that national medicine has unique treasures that are a legacy unique to other countries. How to apply scientific methods to "excavate" and organize them is the unique responsibility of the Chinese medical community, and this great era is the best opportunity to fulfill this responsibility.

As for the current situation, doctors are also raising their consultation fees to improve their livelihoods. There is no reason to criticize this. However, it should be remembered that patients are not necessarily wealthy, and their need for medicine is regardless of wealth. The high cost of consultations is clearly unaffordable for ordinary patients today. Those who are forced to be hospitalized will incur even greater costs: rooms, examinations, medicines, even cotton gauze, and all miscellaneous expenses are borne by the patients. Spending a thousand gold coins on an illness is almost commonplace. Fortunately, if the illness is cured, either the entire family property is mortgaged, or the family is laden with debt, causing the ruin of a middle-class family. Doctors are supposed to have compassion for their patients. Only those who deeply understand the suffering of patients can be called doctors. They should expand their compassionate vision, slightly reduce their own extravagance, open the door to convenience for patients in this time of national crisis, and adhere to the principle of mutual assistance among people. Shouldn't this be the case?

Improving healthcare cannot solely rely on the medical community. When one seeks help from the medical community, one is already ill, and no matter how affordable the medicine, there will still be expenses. Therefore, we hope that society as a whole will focus its efforts on maintaining health when one is not ill. Talking about healthcare is about nurturing life; those who are good at nurturing life will be healthier. The main points are: preventing disease before it occurs, one; recognizing disease before it manifests, two; treating disease in its early stages, three. Paying attention to these three points will not only benefit one's physical and economic health, but also benefit society. Societies in various countries have long had various healthcare organizations. Their methods and intentions have much to offer. The organization and its methods differ. The key is to combine collective strength to solve common concerns. Aim for economy, aim for convenience, aim to use regular minor burdens to cope with unexpected huge problems.

In addition, it is also hoped that society in general will pay attention to public health. Public health should be based on the self-help of the public and led by the government. If the public does not emphasize public welfare and hygiene, even good laws will be difficult to achieve effective results. As for what we expect from the government, it is complete and well-managed public medical and pharmaceutical facilities, proper selection of doctors, proper training of nurses, ensuring affordability for ordinary people, eliminating casual arrogance in attitudes, increasing the number of beds, and expanding the scope of prevention and treatment. All are important. In short, the government's spending should be effective, but also ensure that the public is happy to cooperate, and that patients are willing to trust. It should not be like a government office, a prison, or as rude as torture. If this is the case, government facilities will surely benefit from the cooperation of citizens and achieve twice the result with half the effort.

### Germany's Memorandum to the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg – London Issues a Statement Strongly Refuting It

Berlin – The German government today submitted a memorandum to the governments of Belgium and the Netherlands, the text of which is as follows: "The German government has long been aware of the primary objectives of the Anglo-French war policy and deeply understands that the strategy of Britain and France is to expand the theater of war and turn other countries into subordinate forces of Britain and France. The recent plan in Norway is a manifestation of this strategy. However, due to Germany's swift action, this plan was shattered. Germany has official documents to prove and announce this to the world. After their failure in Scandinavia, Britain and France immediately shifted their target and transferred their main battleships to the Mediterranean, concentrating them in Alexandria, thus making the Mediterranean the center of Anglo-French war propaganda. On the one hand, they want to cover up their failure in Scandinavia, and on the other hand, they want to use the Balkans as the second battlefield against Germany. In reality, the purpose of this transfer is a feint to the east while attacking in the west. Germany has long known that Britain and France have a plan to attack Germany's Ruhr region from the west, using the Netherlands and Belgium as a passage. Germany has already recognized and respected the integrity of Belgium and the Netherlands, but on the natural condition that the two countries adhere to absolute neutrality. Now, Belgium and the Netherlands have not complied with this condition. Although they appear to be neutral, they are actually aiding Germany's enemies. According to documents obtained by the German Ministry of the Interior on March 29 and reports obtained by the German High Command on May 4, the German government specifically presents the following facts: (1) Since the outbreak of the war, newspapers in Belgium and the Netherlands have adopted an anti-German attitude. Although the German government has repeatedly protested, it has not been corrected. In recent months, leaders of the two countries have openly expressed support for Britain and France. (2) The Netherlands and Belgium allow British secret agents to establish agencies in Belgian and Dutch territories, with the aim of inciting revolution in Germany. Senior members of the Belgian and Dutch General Staff have even supported the activities of this secret organization, far violating the basic obligations of neutrality. (3) The military measures taken by Belgium and the Netherlands are even more obvious and completely contradict all declarations of the two countries. (4) For example, Belgium has established defenses on the western border, but there are no fortifications on the Franco-Belgian border, indicating that the Belgian fortresses are entirely aimed at Germany. Germany has repeatedly protested, and Belgium has promised to cancel them, but has not fulfilled its promise. Until recently, it has actively strengthened its defensive fortifications bordering Germany. (5) The Dutch coast also allows British and other troops to enter freely. Since the outbreak of the war, British aircraft have flown into Germany from the Dutch border every day. The German government has repeatedly protested to the Dutch government, but the Dutch government has turned a blind eye and is completely tolerant. Therefore, Germany cannot but believe that the Dutch government is allowing the British Air Force to use Dutch territory as a base for military operations. (6) The concentration of troops in Belgium and the Netherlands even more clearly proves that it is entirely aimed at Germany. (7) When Belgium and the Netherlands concentrated troops on the German border, Germany did not deploy troops to Belgium and the Netherlands until Britain and France deployed a large army on the Franco-Belgian border, and Germany began to take countermeasures. (8) The German government now has documents showing that the British and French plan to attack Germany through Belgium and the Netherlands has reached an advanced stage. Belgian and Dutch airfields have been inspected by British and French officers, and all electrical teams and transportation vehicles are gathered on the Belgian and Dutch borders, with a great sense of preparing for action.

Based on the above facts, it is clear that the attack on Germany by Britain and France is imminent, and this attack will take the route through Belgium and the Netherlands to attack the Ruhr. Therefore, the German government has determined that Belgium and the Netherlands will not only allow Britain and France to pass through, but will also support the Allied countries in various ways. Germany is now in a struggle for survival and cannot sit idly by and watch Britain and France implement their plans. Therefore, it has issued an order to send German troops to Belgium and the Netherlands to protect the neutrality of Belgium and the Netherlands with all military force, but it declares that the German troops will never be enemies of the people of Belgium and the Netherlands. This incident is not what Germany hoped for, and the responsibility rests entirely with Britain and France and the governments of Belgium and the Netherlands, which tolerate the plans of Britain and France. The German government will not attack the two kingdoms of Belgium and the Netherlands and the integrity of their colonies. If the governments of Belgium and the Netherlands want to preserve their people at the last moment, please do not resist. If Belgium and the Netherlands insist on resisting, Germany will use all its strength to crush them, but the unavoidable bloodshed should be the sole responsibility of the Belgian and Dutch governments. May 9, 1940, Berlin.

Berlin – This morning, the German government sent a memorandum to the Luxembourg government, stating that Britain and France have decided to attack Germany through Belgium and the Netherlands, and that Belgium and the Netherlands are likely to help Britain and France attack Germany. Therefore, German troops have been ordered to go to Belgium and the Netherlands to protect the neutrality of the two countries. The German government has sent a copy of the memorandum to Belgium and the Netherlands. At the same time, the German government hopes that the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg will give serious consideration to the current situation so that the people of Luxembourg will not face any difficulties due to Germany's actions. The German government guarantees that Germany has no intention of interfering with or infringing upon the territorial integrity and political independence of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, either today or in the future. (Haitong Telegram, 10th)

London – The British government has issued a statement refuting the German document accusing Belgium and the Netherlands of not maintaining neutrality, as follows: The British and French governments have now taken immediate steps to assist the Netherlands and Belgium by all means. Germany falsely accuses the Netherlands and Belgium of not maintaining neutrality in order to conceal its act of aggression. This kind of advice is completely fabricated. In fact, the strict adherence to neutrality by the Netherlands and Belgium has long been known to the world. The Allied countries have taken all possible measures to prepare for this accident and are now implementing it with great speed. (Reuters Telegram, 10th)

### The U.S. Government Issues a Humanitarian Appeal – Requests Germany Not to Bomb Unfortified Cities

Washington – The U.S. government has requested Germany not to bomb unfortified towns and cities. (Datou Telegram, 10th)

Washington – At the request of Belgium, the U.S. government today instructed its embassy in Germany to inform the German Foreign Ministry that Brussels is a free city and should not be garrisoned. This notification letter was sent by U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles to the German Foreign Ministry after German aircraft bombed the city. The reason is that the U.S. Ambassador to Germany, Grew, reported to the State Department today that German aircraft bombed Beijing, damaging houses near the U.S. Embassy, and that Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak requested him to inform the German side that Beijing is a free city. (United Press Telegram, 10th)

### British and French Declaration Fulfills Obligation to Assist – Powerful Troops Enter Belgian Territory to Aid in Battle

Paris – British Ambassador to Belgium, Sir Clerk, and French Ambassador to Belgium, Laroche, recently sent a declaration jointly issued by the two governments to Foreign Minister Spaak, stating that the Belgian government had previously requested the British and French governments to express their attitude on the matter of concluding an agreement to replace the Locarno Treaty. The British and French governments have been paying attention to this matter for several months. The Belgian government has also stated that it is determined to resist all kinds of aggression or the use of Belgian territory, sea, land, and air bases to invade other countries, and has formed a strong army to protect the country's territory and has provided guarantees, declaring that it will abide by the various obligations stipulated in the League of Nations Covenant. The British and French governments have taken note of all these points. Therefore, the British and French governments recognize that, from this day forward, the various obligations undertaken by the British government in accordance with the Locarno Treaty and the London Protocol of March 19, 1936 (i.e., the one used to reaffirm the Locarno Treaty) have been completely released. However, the ties accepted by Britain and France towards Belgium will still be maintained, and at the same time, it is agreed that all existing ties between the countries will not be hindered by this action. (Havas Telegram, 10th)

Beijing – It is reported that British and French troops have crossed the Belgian border to aid in battle. (Havas Telegram, 10th)

Beijing – British and French troops have begun to move at the request of Belgium. (Reuters Telegram, 10th)

### German Foreign Minister Issues Declaration

Decide to Preemptively Settle Accounts with Britain and France

Berlin – German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop issued the following declaration to domestic and foreign reporters: Gentlemen, after their failure in Scandinavia, Britain and France are now applying their tactics to the Mediterranean. Britain's true purpose is a feint to the east while attacking in the west, and they want to attack Germany's Ruhr region by passing through the territory of Belgium and the Netherlands. This strategy has long been known to the German government and has been carefully prepared for. In the past few days, reports have been received that British troops will land in the ports of Belgium and the Netherlands. Yesterday, Germany knew that Britain would send troops to land in Belgium and the Netherlands, and at the same time, both British and French troops would cross the Belgian border to attack Germany's Ruhr region. Führer Hitler did not want the Ruhr region, the center of German industry, to be attacked by Britain and France, so he sent troops to Belgium and the Netherlands to protect their neutrality. This criminal act of Britain and France has triggered Germany's actions. The aggressive actions of Britain and France are only to maintain the position of their leaders and to maintain the current condemned cabinet. The German government does not care what they are for. Today, the German army will respond to them in the language they understand and wants to settle accounts with their leaders. (Haitong Telegram, 10th)

### Traffic on the Border between Germany and the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg is Cut Off

### Outline of Sichuan Economic Construction Approved and Implemented by the Chairman

Chongqing (Continued from yesterday) The main methods are: Land Survey: First, the whole province will be divided into several zones and land declarations will be handled in stages and completed within a time limit as a preliminary consolidation. Land surveys will be carried out in stages and zones from the 29th year onwards to achieve fundamental consolidation. 2. Agriculture and Forestry (including farmland irrigation and cooperation): The purpose of agricultural construction in this province is to increase food production and the production of commercial agricultural and livestock products. Although most of the soil in Sichuan Province is suitable for rice cultivation, consideration should also be given to local conditions to promote wheat, potatoes and other miscellaneous grains. As for commercial agricultural products, attention should be paid to cotton, tung oil, rapeseed, tea, sugarcane, silk, tobacco, medicinal materials and other products to increase their output and improve their quality. For livestock production, attention should be paid to epidemic prevention on the one hand, and to promoting production on the other, as well as promoting livestock product processing to increase the value of each unit of product. Forest construction should focus on three things: (1) protecting existing trees; (2) felling mature and usable trees according to scientific methods; and (3) cultivating new forests. Water conservancy and irrigation are of utmost importance to agriculture. Although Sichuan Province has a foundation for canals and weirs, it is still limited to local areas and has not been popularized. In the future, it is advisable to (1) promote canal and weir projects so that irrigation can be more widespread, and (2) promote water conservancy equipment so that areas where canals and weirs have not been built can also reduce the threat of drought. According to the investigation, the agriculture of this province in the 28th year has made considerable progress due to the advocacy and improvement of the provincial government. In terms of silk, improved silkworm breeds and mulberry seedlings have been promoted in 15 counties such as Jiangba, increasing farmers' income by more than 6 million yuan. In terms of cotton, improved cotton breeds have been promoted in the northern part of Sichuan, increasing farmers' income by more than 8 million yuan. In terms of food, improved or certified grain varieties have been promoted in 18 counties such as Mianyang and Santai, increasing farmers' income by more than 1 million yuan. In terms of livestock, improved pig breeds have been promoted and pig and cattle blood serums have been injected in places such as Santai and the Three Gorges, increasing farmers' income by more than 500,000 yuan. In terms of disease and insect prevention and control, prevention and control have been carried out in areas where rice, wheat, cotton, citrus, and mulberry trees are planted, increasing farmers' income by more than 5 million yuan. Combining the above-mentioned undertakings, the income of farmers has increased by a total of 20 million yuan. In addition to providing human and financial assistance to the above-mentioned work, the central government has also provided loans to farmers through central financial institutions amounting to more than 40 million yuan. This year, the central financial institutions have decided to handle 100 million yuan in agricultural loans throughout Sichuan, which will be allocated to cooperative credit, agricultural production, agricultural product supply and marketing, agricultural extension, and farmland irrigation. In the future, this province should strive to make sound adjustments in technology and organization to effectively cooperate with financial power, so as to achieve twice the result with half the effort and benefit farmers. 3. Industry and Mining: Industrial and mining undertakings are the focus of modern economic construction, and also the main points of this outline. However, the work is arduous, and it is difficult to see results in the short term without the joint efforts of the government and the people. Since the war of resistance, the central government has invested more than 30 million yuan in Sichuan to run steel, fuel, electricity for public utilities, and electricity to supply industrial power related to national defense. The assisted private enterprises include steel industry such as China Xingye Company, Yuxin Steel Plant, Xiehe Iron Smelting Plant, WeiYuan Mining Company, etc., chemical industry such as Yongli Chemical Company, Tianyuan Electrochemical Plant, paper industry such as Longzhang Paper Mill, Zhongyuan Paper Mill, Chuanjia Paper Mill, and Jialexingshu and other factories, match industry such as Hongji Match Factory, fuel industry such as Jiayang Coal Mine, Tianfu Coal Mine, Neijiang Zizhong Fuxing Alcohol Factory, machinery industry such as Hengshun Machine Factory, Shanghai Machine Factory, Shunchang Machine Factory, Yongli Iron Factory, etc., power industry such as Chongqing Power Company, Qiming Electric Light Company, etc., textile industry such as Yuhua, Yufeng, Qingfeng, Shashi, and other yarn factories, Southwest Flax Weaving Company, China Wool Weaving Company, with a total investment of more than 300 million yuan. The above-mentioned state-owned and private enterprises are only a part of the economic construction of Sichuan Province. In addition, there are many undertakings that can be developed and urgently need to be carried out. In addition to those related to defense that should be organized by the central government, this government should also strive to assist various private industrial and mining undertakings by means of investment loans or guaranteed principal and interest, so as to achieve the early completion of economic construction. 4. Transportation: Agriculture, industry and mining are the main body of construction, and transportation is its lifeblood. The rivers in Sichuan Province are crisscrossed, and have long been an important route for agricultural product transportation. However, they are sometimes narrow and difficult to navigate, or have dangerous shoals and gorges. Surveys should be carried out, and all those that are related to transportation and can be dredged should be investigated and clarified one by one, and construction should be carried out in order of urgency. As for land transportation, railways and highways are the main ones. Since the war of resistance, the central government has been carrying out transportation construction in Sichuan, such as the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, the Xukun Railway, the Xunei Railway, the Baolu Railway, and the Yuqi Railway. In terms of highways, such as the Chengkang Road, the Lexi Road, the Hanyu Road, the Chuangan Road, and the Chuanzhong Road, etc., have either been started and completed within a time limit, or have been selected routes and are being surveyed. In terms of waterway construction, there are those that are being built, such as the Wujiang River and the Qijiang River, those that are being dredged, such as the Jialing River, the Fujiang River, and the Guanhe River, a tributary of the Jinsha River, and those that are being investigated, such as the Yongning River, the Chishui River, the Dadu River, and the main stream of the Jinsha River. The work in terms of transportation is concentrated on the construction of shallow-water vessels and wooden boats. In terms of telecommunications, in addition to the trunk lines connecting the provinces being laid by the central government, those that are purely within the province have been prepared for construction by the provincial government, and are expected to be completed within three years. However, during the war of resistance, the source of railway and ship materials and liquid fuel is difficult, and the provincial government should pay special attention to promoting board boat water transportation and livestock land transportation. 5. Trade: The effect of economic production is to improve quality and increase production, but it must be supplemented by a rational trade system before goods can flow smoothly. According to the investigation, most of the products of Sichuan Province belong to the industrial and mining industries and are sold domestically, while those belonging to the agricultural and livestock industries are partly sold domestically and partly exported. Exported goods should have a strict organization and effective methods of transportation and sales, and should establish close contacts with the central trade authorities, receive their assistance, or help them purchase, so that the goods can be exported as much as possible, without being滞留 in the inland or damaged in transit, so as to maintain the inherent international market and seek to open up new markets. Domestic goods should (1) maintain the free flow of inter-provincial and inter-county transactions; (2) strictly prohibit the malpractices of hoarding, speculation, and manipulation; and (3) maintain a direct and mutually beneficial relationship between producers and consumers, and eliminate the exploitation of middlemen. 6. Finance: Finance is the lifeblood of economic undertakings. In recent years, the central government has been working hard to complete the financial network in Sichuan Province. The provincial government should also have a sound provincial bank as the backbone of local financial institutions. In addition, in order to meet the needs of the vast rural areas, it should (1) promote cooperative banks as financial institutions owned, operated, and enjoyed by farmers themselves. The order of their establishment should be first county and then sparrow, so as to be fast from the bottom up and have a solid foundation; (2) promote agricultural warehouses to assist in the work of agricultural product storage and mortgage, and obtain the convenience of using production funds. According to the investigation, Sichuan Provincial Bank has not been perfect in the past due to insufficient capital. It should immediately increase its capital stock and improve its methods. Dozens of cooperative credit unions have been established by the central government in conjunction with the provincial government, which has not yet reached half of the province. The remaining counties that have not been established should be prepared as soon as possible and established one by one. After the county gold has been established in most cases and the organization is sound, then the expansion and development of the provincial gold bank will be expanded. Agricultural warehouses are established under the guidance of the central competent authority, with more than 100 locations throughout the province, with a capacity of more than 2 million shih. The provincial government should have an active policy to promote them universally on the established basis, so that all remote counties have warehouses, and then the effectiveness of agricultural warehouses can be fully utilized, and rural finance will become more sound. (7) Reclamation: Although Sichuan Province has a large area, the land is not fully utilized. According to the investigation, the rich deposits of forests, livestock and minerals in the province are mostly concentrated in the southeastern and western parts of Sichuan, bordering the border areas of Yunnan, Guizhou and Kang provinces. Moreover, the mountains are vertical and horizontal, transportation is inconvenient, and there are very few immigrants, so they are abandoned. It is estimated that the area of the three regions in the southeastern, southern and western parts of Sichuan is 132,400 square kilometers, and the average population density per square kilometer is only 882 people. Reclamation should be carried out as soon as possible to open up rich resources. (1) Survey the various parts of Sichuan Province to accurately know the area, climate, soil properties and natural reserves of the undeveloped areas as a preparation for reclamation. (2) Organize reclamation groups, which are guided and protected by the government and promoted by the people in cooperation, and carry out them in zones according to reasonable distribution. As for the public security guarantee, health facilities, loan lending and technical guidance of immigrants, they should be properly prepared in advance by the competent authorities of the provincial government. (8) Hygiene: Most people in Sichuan Province lack basic health knowledge, so infectious diseases often spread and the mortality rate is high. The loss of life and the consumption of physical strength are a major obstacle to economic construction. In order to remedy this, (1) hygiene institutes and clinics should be set up in counties and towns to complete the organization of basic-level health care work, focusing on spreading basic health knowledge and preventing and controlling local epidemics; (2) hygiene training institutes should be established to enrich the technology of their basic-level workers; (3) infectious disease hospitals should be established to study the prevention and control methods of infectious diseases and guide the epidemic prevention work of various hygiene institutes; (4) hygiene material research institutes should be established to study domestic raw materials to replace foreign medicines and study agricultural food to improve the nutrition of the people; (Ding) Funds and Funds: Construction funds can be divided into two categories: those used for undertakings without direct benefits are funds, and those used for undertakings with direct benefits are funds. The amount of funds is determined by the provincial government according to the needs of the facts, and a budget is established. The raising of funds is to be designated by the provincial government as a fund, and submitted to the central government for approval, and industrial bonds are issued for investment in the above eight undertakings. A considerable amount of funds should be listed in the provincial budget for guaranteed principal and interest of industrial and mining enterprises, agricultural improvement, industrial trials and tests, investigation and design, etc. If there are undertakings that are too large for the province's public and private sectors to undertake, it is advisable to consult with the central government for joint management. If they have already been undertaken by central government agencies, officials and people of this province should provide all kinds of assistance and establish close links so as to achieve everything in detail and receive great benefits.

### Opposition Parties Refuse to Cooperate: British Government to be Reorganized Soon: Churchill Most Likely to Succeed as Prime Minister: France Prepares to Form a Unified Cabinet

London, Reuters, Parliament Visit Chang said, British Prime Minister Chamberlain may issue a broadcast today to explain his position. Although the current war situation is very tense, and national affairs require him to remain in office temporarily, he does not want to hinder the reorganization of the cabinet for a long time. The National Assembly will be convened on May 14. Reuters has learned that Lloyd George may join Churchill's cabinet as a minister without portfolio. If the government needs to be reorganized immediately, the most likely procedure is to appoint Churchill to organize a war cabinet, while temporarily not changing the positions of the non-war cabinet. (10th Reuters telegram)

London, Reuters, Parliament Visit Chang said, there seem to be two solutions to the current political unrest in Britain: one is to temporarily not change the government structure while the current war situation is unclear; the other is that if the Labor Party Council decides today that there is no need to consult the Labor Party's general meeting on May 13, the Labor Party can cooperate with the new government, then the war cabinet under Churchill's leadership, including Labor Party and Liberal Party members, will be formed tonight. Liberal Party opposition leader Sinclair entered the Prime Minister's residence this morning and met with Chamberlain. Labor Party leaders Attlee and Colin Wu recently issued a declaration, roughly saying that in view of Hitler's recent aggression, the Labor Party deeply knows that in order to obtain the final victory, the government must be reorganized. On the one hand, it reiterated its determination to do its best to seek victory, and asked all party members to devote their efforts to this purpose, and unite firmly to respond to the current difficult situation and make the sacrifices that should be made. (10th Reuters telegram)

London, Reuters, Parliament Visit Chang learned that the political circles will have developments today as a result of the National Assembly debate, and Chamberlain's resignation is almost certain. Last night, people generally speculated that the successor to the Prime Minister would be Halifax or Churchill, or Lloyd George. However, because Halifax is a member of the House of Lords and other reasons, Churchill is most likely to be selected. The Labor Party's decision to join the cabinet rests with the Labor Party meeting, but it is believed that the Labor Party can accept positions in Churchill's government. (10th Reuters telegram)

London, last night, British Prime Minister Chamberlain invited Labor Party leaders Attlee and Greenwood to meet and asked whether they were prepared to join the reorganized government under his leadership, or were prepared to serve in the cabinet under the leadership of another Conservative Party member. It is heard that the Labor Party leaders have expressed the impossibility of serving under Chamberlain's leadership, and the Liberal Party opposition party also holds the same view. As for whether the Labor Party is willing to join a government composed of mixed parties under the leadership of others, this issue will be finally decided at the Labor Party Council meeting in Ban Dizi today. It can be seen from the form of questions asked by Chamberlain to the Labor Party leaders that he is willing to resign as Prime Minister, only to have a national unity government that satisfies all parties succeed him. Attlee and Greenwood entered the Prime Minister's residence and met with Chamberlain for 45 minutes. Foreign Secretary Halifax and Naval Secretary Churchill were present. Chamberlain does not intend to visit the British King today. (10th Reuters telegram)

Paris, after the expansion of the Western European war, Prime Minister Renault immediately contacted the responsible authorities, especially the leaders of the parties in the National Assembly. It is generally expected that the Prime Minister will immediately recruit leaders of the opposition parties to join the cabinet in order to form a unified national cabinet in order to meet the needs of the current situation.

We are now waiting for the comrades of the last European war to come to help us. I believe that Britain and France will be able to give us assistance." In addition, Prime Minister Pierlot gave a speech in the House of Representatives, roughly saying, "Germany despised its signed treaties 25 years ago, and now it has relapsed. After the governments of the five countries asked Britain and France for help, each country immediately followed suit, which is gratifying. Our country is now fighting side by side with Britain and France, and at the same time sharing weal and woe with the Netherlands and Luxembourg. At this time, it is urgent for countries to unite with each other. Recalling that the late King Albert I led the nation to bravely resist during the previous European war, this is a model for all officials and people of our country. I hope that God will bless Belgium and its rights." (10th Havas telegram)

### The Soviet Union Maintains an Independent Diplomatic Policy: To Avoid the War from Extending to Eastern Europe: Ready to Deal with Contingencies at Any Time

Moscow, regarding the new ranks of senior Red Army officers, "Zhen Shi Bao" recently commented, "The Soviet government has decided to adopt an independent diplomatic policy for the benefit of the Soviet Socialist State, and backed by the strength of the Red Army and Navy.

He himself will only serve the party and the country effectively and strive to do his best under the leadership of the leader.

According to Zou Zuohua, he is a soldier whose duty is to obey orders. Now that the central government has entrusted him with a heavy responsibility, he should do his best to restore the lost territory, rescue the elders of his hometown from fire and water, and complete the great task of resisting and rebuilding. However, all plans are still subject to the central government and consultations with Chairmen Wan, Ma, and Miao on the current situation in the four provinces, in order to adapt to the current needs. What he will adhere to in the future is: (1) To obey the central government in everything. The location of the provincial government and the administrative organization are currently under strict planning by the government authorities. (2) To plan and expand the strength of the existing volunteer army in the Northeast, in order to give the Japanese a serious blow at all times, exhaust them, and once the opportunity matures, he believes that expelling the Japanese army will be as easy as turning one's hand over.

### Chinese Army Encircles Nanchang, Already Advancing on Nanchang's Outskirts from Three Directions, Japanese Army Desperately Struggling on the Nanchang-Jiujiang Line

Nanchang Correspondent - The Chinese army considers Jiangxi to be located in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, especially Jiujiang, which is the throat of the Nanchang-Hankou water transport, which is extremely important for the military transportation and economy of central China. However, to recover Jiujiang and cut off the Japanese army's Yangtze River communication, it is essential to take Nanchang first. Therefore, the ×th War Zone is launching an offensive on Nanchang from three directions. The battle situation is recorded as follows:

East Bank of the Gan River

The ×× Army Group advanced north along the Fu River. After crossing the Fu River from Liangjiadu, they advanced like a hot knife through butter. The Japanese army north of Liangjiadu was extremely panicked. In addition to sending aircraft to bomb Liangjiadu, Wenjiaxun, Baihu Ridge, Jiangqian, and Luoxi in rotation to obstruct the Chinese army's advance, they also burned all the villages along the Gan-Zhe Railway, the Gan-Min Highway, the section from Liangjiadu to Xiangtang Shabutan, and the waterway to Wanshe. Even all the trees were forced to be cut down by the local residents. The purpose was to prevent the Chinese army from using them for cover and to completely wrap up all the residents so that they could not help the Chinese army. The Chinese army on this line has advanced to Wanshe, Shabutan, and Tangshugang. The Japanese army is building fortifications in Liantang and Qingyunbu to defend them, forming a stalemate.

West Bank of the Gan River

The Chinese army advanced toward Xinjian and Nanchang from Gaoan and Fengcheng. Outposts around Nanchang, such as Gaoyou and Dacheng, located on the Gan-Xiang and Gan-E routes, have been captured by the Chinese army one after another. The Wanshou Palace, 30 li from Nanchang City, is the highest point overlooking the Niuhang Station of the Nanchang-Jiujiang Railway. After several days and nights of bloody fighting by the Chinese army, the Wanshou Palace was completely occupied on the 23rd, and the Niuhang Station was attacked in the wake of the victory.

Northern Jiangxi

The Nanchang-Jiujiang Railway from Jiujiang to Nanchang has been repaired by the Japanese army and is the lifeline between Nanchang and Jiujiang. The Chinese army attacking this area is flanking the road from the south bank of the Xiu River, cutting off its traffic. After the Chinese army recovered Fengxin and Jing'an, they captured Anyi on the 21st, connecting with the Chinese armies in Ganzhou, Dacheng, and Wanshou Palace, forming a three-sided encirclement of the Japanese army in Nanchang. However, the Japanese army is still holding on to the Nanchang-Jiujiang line and struggling desperately. At the moment, in addition to intensifying the encirclement between the Gan River and the Fu River, the Chinese army is also intensifying its attack on Tujiapu and Zhanggongdu from Ganzhou to cut off the Japanese army's supply. In this way, Nanchang may fall without being attacked. (April 26)

### All Sectors in Hong Kong Raise Funds to Help Compatriots in Zhongshan, Preparing for a Large-Scale Charity Performance, Li Xuefang Coming South to Participate

Hong Kong Correspondent - People from all walks of life in Hong Kong have always generously donated to various relief efforts, which has long been recognized by the world. After the hometown of Premier Sun and the only transportation hub between Hong Kong, Macao, and the mainland, Zhongshan, fell again the month before, the disaster area was vast and there were many compatriots in need. Overseas Chinese in various ports at home and abroad have already raised huge sums of money and remitted them for disaster relief. The Shanghai Zhongshan Refugee Relief Association held a charity broadcast at the Xinxin Company radio station from the 20th to the 22nd of last month, and invited Yong'an Music Society to perform Cantonese opera at the Lanxin Theater from the 22nd to the 26th evenings and the 29th and 30th evenings, raising more than 90,000 yuan in national currency. However, the amount of money raised, converted into Hong Kong dollars, is not much, like a drop in the bucket. It is feared that it will not be of much help. Moreover, Hong Kong is closer to Zhongshan, and residents here will surely be more moved by the disasters in Zhongshan after hearing and seeing them. It is proposed to prepare for a large-scale Cantonese opera charity performance in Hong Kong to raise funds for disaster relief. It was reported that Mrs. Wei Li Xuefang, who was once famous throughout the country for her Cantonese opera and is now resting in Shanghai, agreed to return to Hong Kong to plead for the compatriots and reprise her role, starring in her masterpieces such as "Shi Lin Sacrificing the Pagoda," "Sunset Tears," "Daiyu Burying Flowers," and "Cao Dajia." The association sent committee member Chen Qihao back to Hong Kong a few days ago to prepare and discuss with Hong Kong's gentry and businessmen He Dong, He Disheng, Guo Quan, Cai Chang, Zheng Bozhao, Du Yuesheng, and Wang Xiaolai, who had personally inspected the disaster situation in Zhongshan, to set up an office at the Shui'an Company in Hong Kong, with Guo Quan, the general manager of the company, taking charge nearby and promoting everything. On the one hand, he negotiated with famous Hong Kong actors to join the filming, and on the other hand, he consulted with the owners of major theaters on the matter of borrowing theaters. All progress has been warmly supported by all parties and is progressing very smoothly. People from all walks of life in Hong Kong have heard about it and are more eager for this matter to be realized as soon as possible, so that they can both enjoy famous dramas and fulfill their wish to help the compatriots in need, and believe that since Ms. Li Xuefang intends to perform the famous drama "Daiyu Burying Flowers," there are many scenes for the protagonist Lin Daiyu, as well as other sisters in the Grand View Garden, Wang Fengjie, Xiren, Qingwen, Zijuan, and Madame Wang, so there are many roles needed. If Li Xuefang can take the welfare of the compatriots in need as a prerequisite and humbly recruit Suzhou Mei, Tan Yulan, and Butterfly Shadow, who have penetrated deep into the Marquis's mansion, to play the roles of Baochai, Qingwen, and Xiren, then the four beauties will be complete, and it will greatly enhance the drama. According to reports, Suzhou Mei and Li Xuefang once held the top position of Cantonese opera female actors, and there was a saying that they were Liang and Yu of the time. Tan Yulan and Butterfly Shadow are also rising stars. These four are fortunate enough to have married wealthy husbands and left the stage. Although Suzhou Mei is not from Zhongshan, since leaving the stage, she once put on makeup and went on stage to raise donations for national salvation, reaching 100,000 Hong Kong dollars. Her masterpiece "Peach Blossom Spring" is still a popular hit, and her box office power will definitely not be weak. Helping disaster victims and neighbors is her duty. As for Tan Yulan, whose hometown is Cuiwei, and Butterfly Shadow, whose hometown is Shiqi, their homes have been reduced to ruins by the war. They have an inescapable responsibility for their families and hometowns. This charity performance organized by the Zhongshan Refugee Relief Association is an excellent opportunity for them to roll up their sleeves and show their talents. Leading the group of beauties is not a task for ordinary people. I sincerely hope that Ms. Li Xuefang will take good care of it.

The inspection of secondary education will be conducted by: (1) Wang Fuxi and Sun Weiyue in Fujian, (2) Yang Yuxiu and Wang Defeng in Jiangxi, (3) Li Chaoying and Zi Kui in Hunan, (4) Ding Xianzeng in Hubei.

### Sino-French Institute of Technology is Undergoing Reorganization

Two members from each Chinese and French Side

To be converted into a Technical School by the end of June

It is rumored that the National Sino-French Institute of Technology in this city has received an order from Chongqing to close the school and order all students to leave the school by June 3. The reason is said to be that the National Government's funding is insufficient and it is unwilling to maintain the school. According to the investigation of the Dazhong News Agency, the school continued to operate after the outbreak of the August 13 Shanghai War. When the National Army withdrew westward, the Chinese government continued to allocate funds to the school as usual. When the European War broke out last year, the Chinese and French authorities, in order to adapt to the needs of the times, had planned to suspend it. The French side, according to the contract signed by both parties (that is, if one party intends to suspend or make important changes, it must notify the other party one year in advance and obtain its consent), proposed to the Chinese authorities in Chongqing to continue the school for one year, until June 30 this year. The Chinese and French authorities believe that it is a pity to suspend this school, which has a long history of training industrial talents. With the consent of both parties, a reorganization committee of the National Sino-French Institute of Technology was organized to prepare for the reorganization of the school into a technical school to continue cultivating engineering talents. The members of the reorganization committee have been designated by both parties. The Chinese side is Mr. Mou and Mr. Mou, and the French side is also designated by the French Ambassador Gosi Mo as Gaobai Ai (Director of the Education Department of the French Concession) and Du Boai (Professor of Aurora University) as members. The two parties have held many meetings at the Education Department of the French Concession to engage in all necessary matters for ending the old school and establishing a new school. Currently, the president of the school is Mr. Nong Jun on the Chinese side and Mr. Xue Fan on the French side. Since the school has an international nature, all French opinions and administrative decision-making powers depend on the ambassador. However, if the French ambassador himself is not in Shanghai, the French Consul in Shanghai, Baodai Zhi, is responsible. He has not received any instructions from Chongqing recently.

### Shanghai University and Middle School Students' Friendship Association, Letter to Fellow Students in Shanghai (5)

Dear Students, we believe that the above words are not contradictory at all. This is our most solemn expression. What we need is a calm mind. Please think about it, is now the time to use our reason to judge everything? We believe that students are passionate, loyal, and brave. In the process of fighting, students are also active members. We certainly need to strengthen our actions now, but do we not need an even stronger judgment to deal with the encirclement of this extremely bad environment? Not only our position

Must Be Adhered To

Our thinking must also be constantly corrected, and our actions must not be separated from our actual lives. In other words, we must strengthen our actions from our own current lives. Therefore, we advocate national salvation based on our own positions, using studying as a goal to lay the foundation for resisting the war, building the country, and reviving the nation.

The establishment of the Shanghai University and Middle School Students' Friendship Association is to implement the above propositions. Dear students, when we think of the hardships of the pioneers in creating the Republic of China, when we recall the spirit of the national students who united to save the country during the May Fourth Movement era, and when we think of the loyal and brave soldiers who are now fighting bloody battles on the front lines, what feelings arise in our conscience? We feel that there is no opportunity to serve the country now, but in fact, there are many opportunities to serve the country. Studying hard is serving the country, donating frugally is serving the country, opposing peace and compromise is serving the country, and having reasonable activities is serving the country. In short, as long as we are not passive, not decadent, and do not forget our roots,

It is Serving the Country

Today, we earnestly hope that the students of the whole city will build a new Great Wall in their hearts, recognize the goal, be down-to-earth, and let us work together under the banner of resisting the war and building the country, from individuals to the whole, and even the entire society, to strive for the construction of a free and equal new China. This is where the significance of our commemoration of the May Fourth is, and this is also the focus of our efforts. How much do we really want to encourage! (End)

### General Situation of Adult Education Implementation in Guizhou Province (7)

(9) Conclusion

The implementation of the Adult Education Year is a meaningful task in the province's educational administration and wartime mobilization. After reviewing the implementation process, I sincerely hope to point out the problems encountered, the achievements gained, and the future direction of continuing education, in order to seek correction from the people of the country. (1) Difficulties Encountered In the process of implementing adult education, many problems were encountered. Although most of them could be solved at any time, there were still some problems that could not be completely overcome. The most important of these problems are:

(1) The Problem of Teachers To make more than two million adults who should be attending school universally educated within a year, a large number of teachers are naturally needed, but the supply of qualified teachers is in short supply. Although the method of short-term training has solved most of the number of teachers, the quality of teachers is difficult to improve uniformly due to the uneven quality of the trainees and the limited time.

(2) The Problem of Students Adult class students often have phenomena of absenteeism or unwillingness to learn due to life struggles, occupational mobility, and busy family affairs. Or, due to wartime conscription of migrant workers, clearing the fields, and evacuation, the implementation of formal adult education has been affected to a considerable extent.

(3) The Problem of Teaching Materials The number of teaching materials for adult classes is insufficient, and the content of the textbooks is not completely suitable. The wartime adult education textbooks (How the People Resist the War) compiled and printed by the province are also difficult to distribute on time due to wartime transportation relations. The collection of materials for the current affairs report course is particularly difficult in remote counties due to the slow delivery of information issued by the provincial government.

(4) The Problem of Supervision Although the provincial supervision of the Adult Education Year mobilized the supervisors and supervision commissioners of the Provincial Department of Education to serve as directors of supervision in various districts, and one to two adult education supervisors were added to each district, the vastness of the regions and the inconvenience of transportation made supervision difficult to be thorough. As for the county governments, in addition to mobilizing the staff of the Third Section to go out for supervision, they were also allowed to add several temporary staff members to be responsible for supervision work. However, due to the busy wartime administration, staff members at all levels below the county often could not concentrate on supervision work.

(2) Actual Achievements Although many difficult problems were encountered in the process of implementing the Adult Education Year, considerable achievements have been made in fact due to the concerted cooperation of adult education workers and all sectors of society. Here are a few of the most prominent examples: (Zi) Creating a Strong Educational Atmosphere Since the opening of the Adult Education Year, after the civil servants and intellectuals of the province made a warm publicity, and with the enthusiastic promotion of all sectors of society, the general out-of-school adults went to school. Soon, they deeply felt the need for knowledge and the excitement of reading. Most students requested to extend class time at the end of the term and were unwilling to return their textbooks. They would rather pay compensation for the price of the books so that they could engage in review during agricultural gaps. Excellent students even deliberately submitted blank papers in the final exam in order to gain the opportunity to continue their education. It can be seen that the Adult Education Year has indeed created a warm educational atmosphere.

(Chou) Universally Improving National Consciousness Improving national consciousness and stimulating patriotic enthusiasm were originally important tenets of the implementation of the Adult Education Year, and the gains are also quite significant. For example, adults entering school universally understand that Japanese warlords are China's only enemy, and understand the true meaning of the National Covenant and the Military-Civilian Cooperation Covenant. Whenever there are social activities, adult class students can make impassioned speeches and activities. This shows a glimpse of the improvement of national consciousness. (Shi) Giving Play to the Power of Mass Mobilization Out-of-school adults, after being educated for two months, deeply understand the great meaning of "those who have money give money, and those who have strength give strength," and are motivated by patriotic enthusiasm to make special efforts for wartime service work. For example, the third phase of adult classes in Binyang County launched a campaign to donate cloth shoes and military hats to the soldiers on the front lines. In terms of cloth shoes, there were as many as 15,000 pairs. An adult class in a township in Luchuan County donated 1,600 pairs of cloth shoes. An adult class in Beiliu County held a gold donation on "September 18," which amounted to more than 800 yuan. As for the actual achievements of adult classes in various counties in donating property and providing wartime services, they are too numerous to mention.

(Mao) Promoting Grassroots Construction Work Due to the popularity of adult education, the general public has a better understanding of government orders and is happy to follow them. This can be seen from the fact that the public's participation in village and street people's congresses is more enthusiastic than before, the general bad customs are gradually improving, and the rural public production movement is more active than before. As for women persuading their brothers and husbands to serve in the military, it is also often seen. The facts are sufficient to prove that the power of the Adult Education Year in promoting grassroots construction is becoming increasingly apparent.

(Chen) Enlightening Culturally Backward Counties The implementation of the Adult Education Year concentrated manpower and financial resources, especially in remote counties in the past, which were limited by objective conditions, culturally backward, and educationally withered. By this time, the general educational atmosphere permeated the entire province due to the handling of universal education. The border counties greatly opened up the atmosphere and enlightened the opportunity for cultural progress. (3) Future Prospects The implementation of the Adult Education Year concentrates manpower and financial resources to promote it, although it can meet the requirements of universal education, but the two months of teaching time is too short. In the future, we must devote ourselves to the deepening of education on this basis. Therefore, after the Adult Education Year, a revised implementation plan for adult education in the 29th year was specifically formulated, and continuing classes for adult education were set up, so that adults who have completed two months of adult education have the opportunity to continue their education.

### Finance: German Offensive on Holland and Belgium, Foreign Exchange Suddenly Tightens in the Afternoon

In yesterday's foreign exchange market, HSBC's listed rates remained unchanged. The black market for British and American exchange rates had entered a state of fluctuation. In the morning session, China Bank and Hong Kong Electric came in to absorb supply, and foreign firms' oil and cotton settlements increased significantly. At that time, the supply and demand gradually became uneven and slowly softened. The shortest term was initially at 3 shillings 3.75, and the U.S. exchange rate only settled at 4.71875 yuan. The monthly term tightened to 4.5625 yuan. Fortunately, a certain American bank sold a considerable amount, and speculators continued to emerge, so the upward surge was slightly suppressed. The market suddenly turned loose at noon. In the afternoon, news broke that German troops had invaded Holland and Belgium, and that Brussels had fallen. This news ignited the upward surge, as exchange rates between the U.S. and Britain were expected to fall sharply again. As a result, the U.S. exchange rate softened sharply under the buying pressure from Sino-Japanese banks and Sassoon, ultimately ending at 3 shillings 4.375, U.S. dollars at 4.625 yuan, British tight at .03125, and U.S. tight at .1875. Trading was extremely active throughout the day, and sentiment was unsettled again.

Oil and Cotton Settlements Were Very Active

In the early morning, London long-term bonds and near-term bonds all rose by 1.25. New York silver remained flat, and London gold remained unchanged. The British exchange rate against the U.S. was unchanged, against Shanghai it rose by .0625, and against France it was unchanged. The U.S. exchange rate against Britain rose by 2.25 points, against Shanghai it rose by 1 jiao, and against France it rose by 1.25 points. The central bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. Banks opened with spot selling prices of 3 shillings 4.6875 for British gold and 4.8125 yuan for U.S. dollars, both unchanged compared to last night's closing prices. After the opening, Sassoon and others began to sell, and the market was quite flat. It is estimated that foreign banks sold May U.S. exchange rates at 6875. When HSBC announced its rates, there were no increases or decreases. The silver balancing tax increased by one yuan. After that, an upward surge began. China Bank and Hong Kong Electric both absorbed, and foreign firms' oil and cotton settlements also had strong demand. Therefore, the tightest spot rates for British and American exchange reached 4.71875 yuan, and British gold reached 3 shillings 3.75. At that time, the most transactions were for the May terms. It is estimated that China Bank entered the foreign bank market at 4.625 yuan, and Hong Kong Electric entered the foreign bank market at 4.625 to 59375 yuan. During this period, foreign firms absorbed spot U.S. dollars from foreign banks at 4.75 yuan, and May U.S. exchange rates were also at 4.5375 yuan. However, because speculators sold slightly, the market remained stable.

### European War Expands, Gold Prices Rise Again - Raised to 7160 Yuan After Closing, Demand Exceeds Supply

Yesterday, the black market for spot gold in this city experienced an extraordinary surge, breaking through the 7,000 yuan mark. This was due to foreign news that the European war had expanded, that German troops had invaded Holland and Belgium, and that Brussels had reportedly fallen. It was predicted that U.S. and British exchange rates would plummet, and U.S. dollar exchange rates tightened dramatically. This news reignited the previously weakened sentiment. The market opened firm but stable at 6,860 yuan. Later, a low price of 6,855 yuan was seen. Then, news came that foreign exchange was tightening due to purchases by Hong Kong Electric and foreign firms, and gold and silver firms began to buy, launching an upward surge that soared above 6,900 yuan, reaching 6,955 yuan. Near noon, the market fell sharply by 95 yuan following the decline in exchange rates. In the afternoon, foreign news arrived, U.S. dollar exchange rates tightened sharply, and securities firms bought aggressively, with followers flocking in. As a result, in a situation of demand exceeding supply, the upward surge intensified, rising to a peak of 7,090 yuan at the close, a rebound of 211 yuan. After the close, U.S. dollar bills were unusually expensive, and spot gold followed the rise. Outside the market, prices continued to soar, rising to 7,160 yuan at 6:30 PM with demand exceeding supply. Total trading for the day was over 4,000 taels. Ornamental gold also soared by 20 yuan, reaching 720 yuan. Custom gold, etc., averaged the same.

Then, money exchange firms suddenly began to sell, pushing the price down again. Money exchange firms sold 30 taels to gold firms at 6,855 yuan. Fortunately, silver firms returned to search for purchases, and the price rose again. Later, as foreign exchange suddenly reported tightness, buying momentum gradually expanded, and gold and silver firms competed to buy, immediately breaking through the 6,900 yuan mark. Silver firms traded 10 taels, rising to 6,955 yuan. Unexpectedly, the exchange market suddenly reported a rebound, and retail investors immediately sold at high prices, gradually stepping down the price, retreating to 6,900 yuan, sellers were more numerous, silver firms reversed the trend, dropping by 40 yuan, gold firms sold 10 taels to silver firms at 6,860 yuan, near the close, selling momentum slightly subsided, silver firms seeing low prices bought again, rebounding by 10 yuan, silver firms took in 20 taels from money exchange firms at 6,880 yuan as the midday closing price, In the afternoon, sentiment was quite good, and sellers were scarce.

Money exchange firms sold 10 taels to gold firms at 6,880 yuan.

At this time, a certain gold firm took profits, immediately dropping by 55 yuan, gold firms sold 20 taels to securities firms at 7,030 yuan, after entering, the shorts saw the situation and were anxious to cover their positions, silver firms searched even more, soaring again by 60 yuan, silver firms took in 20 taels from gold firms at 7,090 yuan as the evening closing price, as a result, it soared 211 yuan compared to the previous day, with a total of 235 yuan fluctuations, the cash gold firm's gold selling price was 10 yuan higher than the spot, The buy-back price was reduced by more than 20 yuan, and the current gold price was 50-60 yuan lower than the listed gold price.

Silver Store Ornamental Gold Listed at a High Premium

As a result, the total premium was 20 yuan. It is estimated that larger stores changed the price to 720 yuan, and new stores had the same price. The buy-back price was reduced by 30 yuan.

### Foreign Currencies Rise Sharply in the Evening

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw stable British and American gold pounds in the morning. In the afternoon, due to the German invasion of Holland and Belgium, gold prices rose sharply, so buying interest surged. As a result, all currencies rose by 5 yuan compared to the previous day. British gold bills rose in the morning and returned to flat in the afternoon. U.S. dollar bills fluctuated slightly firmer in the morning session, but the black market U.S. dollar exchange rate shrank significantly in the afternoon, reaching a high of 21.5 jiao in the evening, a sharp rise of 1 yuan compared to the previous day. There was some demand for Hong Kong bills, and market prices rose slightly. There was also strong demand for French franc bills and New Dutch, Annamite, ruble, Canadian, and Philippine bills, and market prices all rose uniformly. The supply and demand for Japanese gold bills and Korean bills were both balanced, and market prices remained stable. The former was 1.28 yuan, and the latter was 1 yuan.

### Discount and Call Loan Interest Rates Remain Flat

Yesterday's discount rate for drafts and bills of exchange fell and then returned to flat. Initially, the rate per 1,000 yuan fell from 118 yuan to a low of 105 yuan in the morning, around 110 yuan at noon, and rose to 125 yuan in the afternoon. The final rate was 120 yuan, similar to the previous day's price. The Money Industry Association's call loan interest rate remained at 2.5 jiao in both the morning and afternoon markets.

### Securities: Foreign Stocks Fluctuate

The black market for securities started firm and then weakened yesterday. The number of buyers in the market decreased sharply, and the situation of supply exceeding demand reappeared. Ultimately, due to a lack of counterparties, transactions were extremely scarce. Except for Class C shares, the market was quite deserted. Class D shares held their ninth lottery. Because the dividend for winning shares was reserved, they were uniquely higher, mostly by a small amount. This was because other types of shares had weakened, bringing them down. After the market closed, news of the German-Dutch war and Chamberlain's dismissal secretly pushed prices even lower, and the future was difficult to view with optimism. In the morning, Lianyi, Hongda, Le Mao, and Yitai opened with buying offers that were 1-2 jiao stronger than the previous day, but Tongshun and Hongkang sold in large quantities, and the price gradually declined. Although there were many sellers in the afternoon, there were very few buyers, so they mutually held back, and the market only differed by 5 cents. As a result, except for Class D shares, which were uniquely higher due to the lottery, the others were only about 1 jiao higher. Class E shares were slightly better at 1 jiao. The total transaction volume was only about 500,000 yuan. A simplified table is listed below:

Category　Highest　Lowest　Closing　Compared to Previous Day

Unified A　59.5　——　59.25　Down 0.05

Unified B　50.85　50.7　50.7　Down 0.15

Unified Domestic　48.85　48.55　48.60　Down 0.10

Unified D　47.60　——　47.60　Up 0.90

Unified E　49.60　49.40　49.45　Up 0.10

For stock trading, 50 shares of Guanshen Food Company stock were transacted at 40 yuan.

The stock market closed firmly. Those who were settling deals for the week rushed to sell, and prices fell as usual. The stocks that were most heavily traded at the beginning of the week fell the most at this time. British Union shares fell from 70 yuan to 67.5 yuan for buying and 68.5 yuan for selling at the close, with about 35,700 shares changing hands. International shares ranged from 38.5 yuan to 37.25 yuan, closing with buying offers at 37 yuan. Yangzi shares remained stable at 21 yuan until the close. Chinese Textiles shares opened with buying offers at 30.25 yuan, fell to a low of 28.25 yuan at one point, and closed with a rebound, priced at 28.5 yuan for buying and 29 yuan for selling.

Rubber stocks continued to soften slightly. The decline compared to the previous day's close was very limited, and some even rebounded, such as Langgezhi shares, which closed over 1 yuan higher than before. Given the prevailing situation, it is safe to say that the market will tend to improve next Monday. However, news came in the afternoon that German troops had invaded Holland, so it is difficult to make a prediction about the future market situation. Perhaps there will be a slight impact, or perhaps there will be no impact at all, only causing traders to hesitate.

London, May 9 (Thursday) -- Today, the listed prices of Chinese and foreign bonds remained flat, with no changes in the prices of various bonds.

London, May 9 (Thursday) -- Today, the listed prices of stocks of British Far East companies were generally stable. Only Gulak Lim Bang rubber shares fell 4.5 pence to 18 shillings 1.5 pence. The rest were unchanged.

### Dividend of Semag Rubber Canceled

The British firm Huatong Foreign Firm, the agent for Semag Rubber Limited, resolved at a board meeting yesterday to distribute an interim dividend of 1 jiao per share in national currency on May 24 for the year ending September 1940. The interim dividend for this year will only be distributed once due to the Malayan government's foreign exchange controls.

### Yarn and Cloth: Extreme Price Differences Due to Buying and Selling Short

The yarn market is now fluctuating. After a big increase, it has begun to react and decline. But the market situation is extraordinarily chaotic and inconsistent. The prices of the same 20-count cotton yarn can differ by 100 to 150 yuan. This situation is entirely due to a lack of actual transactions and tight credit. The price of 20-count yarn for speculative purposes is unusually high, due to short selling.

Because of depressed sentiment and floating short positions selling off, the yarn market fell by 30 yuan in the morning, to 1,570 yuan. Then news came that British domestic customs was to be restructured, foreign exchange was reduced, and cash trended higher, and buyers were again active, rebounding to 1,615 yuan. Statistics on trade in the half-day came to 1,560 packages, with 10-count Biamah yarn rising by 8 yuan. Today, there are 1,335 pieces of cotton yarn to be shipped to Hong Kong, 125 pieces to Guangzhou Bay, 25 pieces to Haikou, and 50 pieces to Haiphong. The amounts of yarn bought by various groups are listed below:

Qiaogang 380, Trading Houses 1,120

Ningbo 10, Total 1,560

In the afternoon, news broke that German troops had suddenly attacked Holland, and gold prices surged. Speculators were very active, and the yarn and cloth exchange was bustling. The price of a certain 20-count yarn suddenly rose by more than 30 yuan.

### Spot Indian Cotton Transactions Particularly Active

The volume of local cotton transactions was sparse. However, Indian cotton transactions developed exceptionally, and Indian cotton telegraphs were affected by the cloud of war in Europe, causing prices to decline, and sentiment was slightly restrained. The transaction situation for the spot cotton are listed below:

360.00

Mitterling 342.00 Trading house purchase 00 pieces

335.00

Pengjiapu 305.00 Again 300 pieces

Lower Sha packaging 286.00 Again 440 pieces

Middle India 280.00 Again 100 pieces

Xingheng 288.00 Again 200 pieces

The market price for foreign cotton. The New York cotton market was firm from the beginning. As the purchases of speculators and Wall Street increased, the market situation improved and shorts moved to cover, as a result, the continuous falling trend was halted and the cotton market rose eight to nine pounds. The Indian cotton market ultimately saw the European situation deteriorate and prices fell three rupees. Egyptian cotton rose eight to nine pounds.

Trading in Shanghai foreign cotton was impacted by news that Germany had invaded Holland and exchange rates tightened. Traders felt that the expansion of the war in Europe would increase the difficulty of transporting foreign cotton to China, and recent purchases by Tianjin traders saw available supplies fall. The retail prices were exceptionally profitable, and there was a general feeling that spot cotton would rise sharply. Below are the market prices converted to delivered prices at the factory at the exchange rate of $4.75.

20 Count US Middling 364.50

20 Count Again Lower Grade 321.10

32 Count Again 389.70

32 Count Again Lower Grade 374.50

42 Count Again 432.10

42 Count Again Lower Grade 380.10

### Piece Goods: Resurgence of East Goods Stockpiling, Strong Increase in Prices

Yesterday's market for local cloth started weak and became firm in the afternoon. Real sales stagnated, merchants released stocks, and low prices appeared repeatedly. However, with the sudden rise in gold prices and market rumors of a critical situation in Germany and Holland, sentiment rose, and the market gradually rebounded. The final result was similar to the previous day. Due to the sharp drop in exchange rates, the Ningbo and Wenzhou traders added slightly to their orders. Transactions included over 100 pieces of fine cloth, bleached cloth, colored cloth, and coarse cloth. Guangdong traders ordered several hundred pieces of colored cloth and poplin and printed goods. Local dyeing factories ordered over 10,000 pieces of grey cloth and 5,000-6,000 pieces of poplin and colored cloth. Overseas locations such as Singapore ordered over 5,000 pieces of colored cloth, colored twill, and bleached cloth.

Yesterday, with the rebound in gold prices, those with bullish sentiments for Eastern cloth resumed stockpiling, and the upward trend strengthened. Twelve-pound Dragon Head fine cloth rose another 3.5 yuan per piece compared to the previous day's market. The highest price for the Dragon Head spot warehouse receipt reached 53.8 yuan, and the closing price was 53.3 yuan. Four Gentlemen's serge closed at 1.525 yuan per yard. The price for the current month was 1.57 yuan. Retail sales remained clear, but traders from the north were bullish and collected 600-700 pieces of spot and forward fine cloth of various brands.

Exports: Today (the 11th), 487 pieces of cotton cloth are being shipped to Hong Kong, 250 pieces to Guangzhou Bay, 29 pieces to Haimen, 982 pieces to Haiphong, 50 pieces to Yantai, and 380 pieces to Tianjin.

### Demand for White Canvas Increases

Yesterday's woolen fabric market remained strong. Sales of white canvas were quite smooth yesterday due to the increased demand from tailors making summer uniforms. The wholesale price for domestically produced Three Star wide-width white canvas is currently 2.6 yuan per yard, and narrow-width miscellaneous brands are 1.9 yuan. Non-Western goods from the Old Knife brand are 2.85 yuan.

### Grains: Glutinous Rice Suddenly Rises

Speculators Are at it Again, Foreign Rice Follows and Also Rises

After consecutive declines in the rice market, domestic glutinous rice, in particular, was the cheapest. Common Danshao goods were selling for only 37-38 yuan, a difference of as much as 10 yuan compared to Gao Geng and Saigon rice. Under normal circumstances, even broken grains only suitable for making sugar would sell for 42-43 yuan. Therefore, how could no one consider this abnormal glutinous rice market? However, with attention focused on foreign rice, there was no time to look at this. Now that foreign rice is dull, attention is turned to domestic glutinous rice and actively purchased. The market is falling, and the usual quiet atmosphere is broken. The owners, already taking into account their own financial situations, were unwilling to sell lightly. Now they have an opportunity, and the selling price immediately rose by 2 yuan. Estimates for Jinzhou Special 42 yuan, 41.5 yuan, Changshu Danshao high quality 41 yuan, market average 40 yuan or less, and 39 yuan for lower quality.

The source of domestic rice, such as thick and thin Geng rice, has been disrupted, rumors outside the market say that generally the owners believe the weather is turning cold and there is no worry about the quality, and have a solid intention to defend their position, prices rebound 1 yuan, Wuxi Special Clear Geng rice selling for 50 yuan, Fenshao Geng rice 49 yuan, Changshu Geng rice 48-49 yuan, Suyu 46-47 yuan, Qingsi Extra Thin Gao rice 50 yuan, 49.5 yuan, general market 48-49 yuan, Nangan early rice 47-48 yuan, etc.

After the recent rush to dump, some stores cheaply resold foreign rice, so the early market had a tight supply. Then, clients from the countryside followed and bought. Although the regulations that restrict speculative transactions and insist on timely payment and delivery of goods have been newly implemented, the speculative fever inside and outside the industry has not abated, and it is not easy to return to the right track. And, a large new batch of foreign rice was pre-purchased by customers and are waiting to be transshipped to other ports. Both retail sales and hoarding are also active. Therefore, the asking prices have been increasing since the beginning of trading, and the midday close was already up 5-6 jiao. In the afternoon, rumors favored buyers, and the market rose again. For example, Xiao Jiao opened at 47.5 yuan and rose to 48 yuan in the morning and rose from 47.5 yuan to 48.3 yuan in the afternoon. Other spot rice all rebounded 2-3 jiao in the afternoon, Grade 2 Saigon original package spot 60 yuan, short supply of the upper period of May, the price rose from 60.06 yuan to 60.08 yuan, a gain of one yuan, but little was sold.

Also reported, there are more than 6,200 bags of foreign corn today, loaded on the Taikoo Company's Shuntian wheel and shipped to Weihaiwei, and 120 bags of foreign rice also shipped to Weihaiwei.

### Flour Market Eases

The flour market has gradually eased. Both domestic and foreign transactions were inactive. After an initial impulse, Nan Yang sales had been in transit and customs procedures were slower. Local wholesale volumes were less than 5,000 sacks. While prices for Grade 2 flour remained unchanged, returned deliveries of old brand names have fallen over 1 jiao, down from an opening of 14.15 yuan to 14.1 yuan by the close and transactions were scattered. Other inland brands still sell for approximately 14.2 yuan. Buyers and sellers are currently holding back. 1,000 sacks of flour will ship to Yantai tomorrow (the 11th) and 2,000 to Tianjin.

Trading in both wheat and flour was sluggish with sellers and buyers holding back.

### Miscellaneous Grains Oil Cakes Wavering Uncertainly

Recently, the oil bean cake market has been sluggish due to both poor actual sales and a lack of new impetus, resulting in inconsistent interest. Over the past two days, the market first fell due to an oversupply, then rebounded due to positive external factors. Therefore, the overall situation is wavering and uncertain, with transactions scattered. Yesterday, only 170 barrels of Qingdao peanut oil were traded, priced at 110 yuan original price. A total of 220 barrels of Dalian bean oil were traded, with the price falling from 105.5 yuan to 105 yuan, then rising back to 106 yuan at the close. Tayou Factory oil was securely opened for 100 dan, priced at 86 yuan. Bean cake buyer groups were inactive, with only two cartloads of reduced-price Yuandong cake inquired about, priced at 10 yuan and 4 jiao. 1,000 pieces of Tongshen cake were priced at 10 yuan and 5 jiao. The market for soybeans is extremely narrow, with only over 600 packages of Wuhu beans purchased by oil presses, while Anqing beans and Dalian beans are entirely subject to listed prices.

In addition, yesterday 410 pieces and 350 cans of bean oil arrived from Yantai, and 510 cans arrived from Qingdao. Today (the 11th), there are 5,650 cans of raw oil and 420 packages of sesame seeds, all being shipped to Hong Kong.

### Sugar Market Hoarding Dutch Sugar

Yesterday, the sugar market was relatively soft in the morning. The association set the price of spot goods at 24 coarse white local firm small 5 jiao, at 75 yuan and 2 jiao. Foreign firm new goods were 74 yuan and 8 jiao to 75 yuan, small jiao to 4 jiao. Old goods remained at 75 yuan. Transit goods for delivery on May 20th were 99 yuan and a half. Taikoo refined white remained largely unchanged. Western firm B mark was 87 yuan, HX mark was 86 yuan, and the rest were lacking decline. However, at 2 p.m., news arrived from abroad that Germany and the Netherlands had gone to war, resulting in sellers disappearing and prices rising by varying amounts of three to four yuan. State firm quotations remained firm, with slight transactions and no fluctuations. According to Xinhua telegraph, Qing white sugar uniformly rose.

### North-South Goods High Price for New Toona Sinensis

Since the new Toona sinensis appeared on the market, the opening price decline has already exceeded half. However, since the goods handled by the merchants were purchased earlier and costs are relatively high, the selling price has to be slightly raised. Yesterday's market price was 80 yuan, which is also 40 yuan lower than the initial price, and has temporarily stabilized.

Couple's Knowledge

### Why is a Husband's Energy Declining?

— Co-authored by Dr. Yao Chongpei, American Medical Doctor of Sexually Transmitted Diseases

(Clinic) 2nd Floor, China Trust Company, Intersection of Beijing Road and Sichuan Road

(Time) 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., Closed on Sundays

One point of energy, one point of career, energy is especially the driving force of love!

In addition to managing household affairs, a wise wife must pay special attention to whether her husband's energy is healthy! Sometimes, if her husband's energy declines slightly, she will definitely comfort him tenderly and carefully study the reasons and methods to restore or even enhance his energy. Therefore, a wife's medical knowledge is also very important. From this point of view, if a husband truly loves his wife, he should start by loving his own energy. Indeed, the married life of a man with abundant energy and a beautiful woman must be very happy and sweet, with love , giving birth to sons and daughters, what a wonderful family this is! At the same time, encouraged by love, a man will inevitably become more courageous, thoughtful, and hardworking, which is so helpful to the progress of his career! Therefore, many men and women, after a happy marriage, embrace mutual love and assistance, working together with one heart, striving towards their bright and happy future, as if decades are like a day. When their descendants achieve fame and honor their ancestors, and the old couple celebrate their birthdays, may their parents be healthy and peaceful, what happiness!

Conversely, if a couple does not know how to cherish their energy, or has committed self-pollution and indulgence in their early years, damaging the endocrine fluid in their reproductive glands, then the man's energy will rapidly decline after marriage, leading to premature ejaculation, impotence, incomplete development, spermatorrhea, infertility, neurasthenia, and other symptoms. However, women often experience an increase in their sexual needs after marriage, but the husband's energy declines, making coordination difficult in sexual life, causing love to be destroyed. In today's era, women who are sexually dissatisfied may commit adultery, elope, or even file for divorce with their husbands, which is countless!

In theory, if a husband's energy declines, he should make a decisive decision to restore and enhance it as soon as possible, but the wife should also find ways to remedy it. Fortunately, medicine is advanced today, and remedy is no longer difficult. However, it is essential not to take medicine randomly or seek medical treatment blindly. According to world-renowned doctors and our experience, taking a strong animal reproductive gland lysate "Reproductin" is the most effective treatment. This agent is based on the most advanced principle of supplementary therapy in modern medicine. It is refined by scientific concentration and replication from the endocrine essence of the reproductive glands of strong animals such as gorillas, tigers, wolves, bears, deer, and sea dogs, so the quality is pure and precious, the medicinal properties are mild and comprehensive, and the replenishing power is active and great, which is unmatched by any similar preparation. Therefore, men can generate sperm, replenish the kidneys, strengthen the brain, and activate blood circulation overnight after taking it. It is especially important to take it continuously, which will further promote development, nourish the nerves, and cure various symptoms in a short period of time, making energy more abundant, marital love happy, and middle-aged and elderly people who take it regularly will live longer, rejuvenate. However, those who suffer from seminal emission must also take the special medicine for seminal emission, "Hemitol Spermatostatic Tablets" (sold in major pharmacies such as Sino-Western Five Continents and the Western Medicine Department of Wing On Company, two yuan per box) to stop the leakage, which will be more effective!

### The Crisis of Nocturnal Emission in Summer

— Sexually Transmitted Disease Specialist Zhan Nianceng

Spring unknowingly sneaked back, and the seasons have reached summer! The temperature of the climate rises day by day. I think everyone has experienced the horror of hot summer! For a young man suffering from nocturnal emission, the crisis of summer is imminent! Because the seminal fluid in our human body, in physiological terms, is the so-called endocrine fluid in the reproductive glands, which functions to promote development, promote metabolism, nourish the brain, sex, bone marrow and other nerves. If you suffer from nocturnal emission and do not seek treatment, this source of life is likely to gradually dry up! Therefore, symptoms such as brain failure and forgetfulness, insomnia and palpitations, back pain, premature ejaculation and impotence, incomplete development, scattered energy, and premature aging will appear one after another. This kind of weak young man, once in the summer, the symptoms will inevitably worsen due to the hot climate. If he is a student in school, he will feel dizzy, brain swelling, tinnitus and blurred vision with a little brain use, and his academic performance will plummet. If he is a practitioner in the industrial and commercial sector, he will feel tired and unable to cope with a little labor. If he is in a love scene, he is often abandoned by women because of his yellow face, thin body and unpromising appearance. After marriage, it is even more difficult to obtain coordinated happiness in the couple's life, or even perform family tragedies such as elopement and divorce! The vast future is nothing but a dead end!

It is still not too late to treat nocturnal emission in early summer.

Beauty

### The Defect of Deficient Breasts

— Dr. Yao Chongpei, American Medical Doctor—The Most Significant Effect in Early Summer

Everyone knows that women's concept of beauty is more intense. However, many women have simple minds! Their love of beauty completely disregards reality and blindly emphasizes decoration. You should know that if you are born not beautiful and have various defects, such as withered muscles, haggard appearance, thinness, especially flat breasts, even if you wear gorgeous new clothes in 1940, you will look like a walking dead. What touching beauty is there? Moreover, modern men look at women, often taking the beauty of curves as the standard, and the main conditions for forming the beauty of curves are a pair of towering breasts and full and swaying hips. If the development of these two cannot reach perfection, then there will be no curves at all, how can it be graceful and moving? How can it win men's favor? Therefore, women of this generation are often rejected by society and abandoned by their families, and as a result, their fate must be extremely tragic!

Then why are these women so unfortunate? According to the research results of world-renowned gynecologists Kang Delin, James Te, and French beauty expert Dr. Wei Niji, it is generally believed that they are all caused by self-binding breasts, insensitive leucorrhea, nutritional disorders, multiple difficult births, and severe illnesses, which lead to the destruction of ovarian function and affect metabolism. The only way to save it is to take the female "Reproductin," a reproductive gland ovarian endocrine preparation, which is the most effective treatment. This agent was invented by German medical saint Dr. Stanena after more than 30 years of arduous experiments. Its ingredients are purely made of fresh ovaries of young animals, supplemented with precious products such as phosphorus, calcium, and vitamins from minerals and plants, and refined under the most perfect scientific settings. Therefore, the medicinal properties are peaceful and the efficacy is accurate, and it can be taken regularly regardless of cold or heat. If you take it in the early summer of spring growth, it will be more effective. If you continue to take it, it will cure diseases if you have them and strengthen your body if you don't. Even if the breasts are as withered as a man, I believe that after three months, they will be more than two inches high, and at that time, you will be trembling with grace and your heart will be blooming.

Iron-Like Facts

(1) Nocturnal Emission Almost Ruined His Life Sexually Transmitted Disease Specialist Zhan Nianceng

Mr. Guo Yangzhi, from Xuzhou, is 21 years old and a boarder at a university in this city. Because of his intelligence, his academic performance has always been among the best. However, because he likes to read erotic novels, he has been moved to the point where he cannot restrain himself, and he has developed the bad habit of self-pollution. Due to the injury caused by self-pollution, his sexual nerves are weakened, his sperm pass is loose, and he has developed nocturnal emission. At first, it was only two or three times a month, then it increased to five or six times, or more than ten times. As a result, he felt his brain weakened, his memory was bad, he had insomnia at night, and he was absent-minded during the day. With a little labor, he felt back pain, his limbs were exhausted, and his schoolwork plummeted. He failed the exam last semester, which surprised his teachers and friends, and Mr. Guo himself felt inexplicable. However, Mr. Guo knew that his body was gradually weakening, so he bought and took so-called "nocturnal emission pills" on the market, but they were all ineffective, and his symptoms worsened. Just when he was worried, his friend Mr. Zhang introduced him to this clinic for diagnosis and treatment. After a detailed examination of his symptoms, he knew that it was indeed caused by the failure to treat nocturnal emission, so he ordered him to go to the Wuzhou Pharmacy to buy two boxes of "Hemitol Spermatostatic Tablets," a special medicine for treating nocturnal emission, and two dozen of "Reproductin," a tonic for the brain and kidneys, so that he could take them continuously, and apply new medical treatments such as electrotherapy and injections every other day. After more than a month, all his illnesses were suddenly cured, his brain was clear, his energy was strong, and he was an active young man again.

(2) Men with Premature Ejaculation and Impotence are Most Hated by Their Wives

Mr. Lin Feng, 25 years old, got married last year. On the wedding night, there was a sound of quarrel from the couple, so the couple's relationship was extremely bad and there was no happiness in the family. Mr. Lin suffers from premature ejaculation and impotence, and has never been able to exercise his marital rights after marriage, so his wife is still a virgin. How can she not be frustrated! Mr. Lin knew that if this continued, there would be many problems! So last month, he came to this clinic for diagnosis and treatment in person. After learning about his symptoms, he ordered him to buy three dozen of the male tonic "Reproductin." Because he had slight nocturnal emission, he also took a little "Hemitol Spermatostatic Tablets" and applied Die Men's electrotherapy every day. After more than a month of careful treatment, he felt that his sperm was strong and the love between the couple was overwhelming.

### Seven Robbers in Front of Jianghai Customs Attempted to Rob Over One Million in Tax Revenue Japanese Escort Was Shot Once by the Robbers Four Injuries Including a British Man from the China Press One Robber Shot and Captured All Other Robbers Escaped

Inside the Jianghai Customs Building on the Bund, Fuzhou Road, a major robbery occurred at approximately 6:10 p.m. yesterday. Police and robbers fought fiercely on the spot, firing a total of seven or eight shots. The gunfire was as dense as raindrops. A total of six people were injured, including Westerners, Japanese, and passers-by, and a chauffeur. As a result, the tax revenue was not robbed. Details obtained through interviews are as follows.

Seven Robbers Blocked the Way

Since the Jianghai Customs tax revenue has been controlled by the Japanese, it has been customary for the Japanese Bank of Chosen to send personnel to the tax revenue office at the back door of the Customs every afternoon to transfer the daily tax revenue to the Bank of Chosen. Yesterday at approximately 6:10 p.m., a Japanese employee of the bank was preparing to transfer over one million yuan in cash, using a private car (Concession Permit No. 3886, Forged Permit No. 936), back to the bank. The money was loaded into the car, and as it drove out of the Jianghai Customs gate, suddenly seven robbers, three dressed in Chinese clothing and four dressed in Western clothing, blocked the way. Each took out a pistol, threatening to force the Japanese employee and the chauffeur out of the car. At this point, the chauffeur could not forcibly resist and was forced out of the car. The Japanese employee, however, was terrified and dared not leave the car. One of the robbers then fired a shot at the Japanese man. The bullet entered through the left side window of the car and hit him in the left arm.

Bullets Flying, Many Injured

At that time, two patrolmen at the Jianghai Customs gate, hearing the alarm, stepped forward and fired a shot at the robbers, but missed. A nearby Indian constable (No. 141) also rushed to the scene. The robbers, seeing the situation was not good, immediately opened fire to resist arrest, attempting to escape. For a time, the gunfire was as dense as raindrops, and the order was in chaos. Pedestrians fled in all directions. At this time, a silver car was parked by the roadside (Permit No. 18272). The driver, Qin Shengtin, from Pudong, 37 years old, two of the robbers jumped into the car, attempting to escape. But the driver firmly refused to drive. The robbers were helpless and had to get out of the car, taking out a pistol and firing two shots at Qin. One bullet hit his back, but did not penetrate. One bullet hit his left foot. A stray bullet hit the buttocks of Anlide, a British proofreader at the China Press. Before long, Indian Constable No. 141, who was pursuing the robbers, was shot in the right thigh by the robbers. Pedestrian Cao Huanxiang (34 years old) was also hit in the right shoulder by a stray bullet.

One Robber Captured, Other Robbers Escaped

After hearing the news, the Central Police Station immediately dispatched a large number of police officers in several police cars to surround the area on all sides, cut off traffic, and search for the robbers. At the same time, ambulances were urgently summoned to take the injured to hospitals for treatment. The Japanese man was sent to Fumin Hospital. The silver car chauffeur and pedestrian surnamed Cao were sent to Baolong Hospital. The Westerner Anlide was sent to Gongji Hospital. As for the robber Wen Guiqing (22 years old), who was shot twice and captured on the ground in front of the Continental Bank on Hankou Road, and the injured Indian Constable No. 141, they were both sent to the Patrolmen's Hospital on Shanhaiguan Road. It was also learned that the robber was shot twice, injuring his legs and right hand. The injuries were very serious and his life was in danger. The tax revenue was still intact and was not robbed. When reporters went to investigate the incident afterward, the Jianghai Customs gate was heavily guarded. Several Japanese military police were stationed nearby with guns, and the situation was extremely tense.

### Germany Invades the Netherlands News Reaches Shanghai The Statement from the Dutch Consulate The Dutch Authorities Decided to Resist to the End German Intelligence Officer Couldn't Justify Himself

The expansion of the European war situation is an undeniable fact, and military secrets are especially variable and subtle. The reporter had just asked Mr. Coder, an intelligence officer at the German Embassy, at 6 p.m. the day before yesterday whether Germany had any intention of invading the Netherlands, citing the tense situation between Germany and the Netherlands. He replied that Germany had no need to invade the Netherlands. Unexpectedly,

The ink was barely dry,

German troops actually entered the Dutch border, and news of the bombing of the Dutch capital by air arrived in Shanghai. The reporter then went to ask Mr. Coder about this matter, hoping to get the truth. He seemed deeply surprised by the reporter's visit in a hurry, and only said, "Sorry, I can't talk about it. Please read our extra edition. The news can be found there," and left. So the reporter went to,

The Dutch Consulate

Met with Secretary Yhman and asked for his opinion on the German invasion of the Netherlands. He said that Germany's attack on the Netherlands was clearly aimed at using the Netherlands as an air force base to attack England and France, and to threaten the back of France. The Dutch authorities are determined to resist to the end and plan to open the sluices

To Flood the German Army

However, whether it can absolutely prevent the German army's advance depends on the effectiveness after implementation. As for the Dutch East Indies, the Dutch navy is also concentrated there, preparing to deal with all emergencies. However, it has not yet been mobilized. After receiving this news, the Dutch Bank in this city suddenly stopped exchanging currencies in the afternoon of yesterday. However, there was still an exchange market in the morning, at 8.75 yuan and 8.875 yuan. (Pingming Society)

The Dutch Consulate Received Telegraphs from its Home Country

According to another report, Mr. Bosafan, the Dutch Consul General in this city, claimed that the consulate had received a telegram from the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs, confirming that the German army had invaded Dutch territory. However, Germany had not submitted any documents to the Netherlands beforehand. The telegram stated: "Germany did not submit any documents to the Netherlands, but suddenly invaded Dutch territory. The airfield has been bombed by the German side." According to the Dutch Consul General, the administrative situation of the Dutch in the Far East will not change in any way. He also believes that the Dutch transport company in the Far East will not be affected in any way, and will not change its route.

### Dongzhe Asphalt Transported to Shanghai Still Requires Exchange Settlement

Dongzhe asphalt transported to Shanghai still requires exchange settlement. The previous rumor about the lifting of the ban is not accurate. Recently, the inland price is high, and the cost of arriving in Shanghai is over 110 yuan per dan.

### Conditions Proposed by Xiangtai Workers

Transmitted to Capital by Detective Lin Compensation Already Paid for the Beaten Workmate

The labor strike at the British Xiangtai Timber Company. Because the arrested workmates were not released and the conditions for improving treatment urgently needed to be revised in order to submit them to the capital again, a meeting of all workmates was convened at 3 p.m. yesterday. The following

Six Conditions

Were resolved: (1) Ask the general manager, Collins, to negotiate with the court to release the arrested workmates Liang Shiji and others, and not to suspend their work; (2) For every stone of rice priced above 13 yuan, each person will receive a subsidy of five dou of white rice per month; (3) Those with daily wages of less than one yuan will have their wages increased by 10%, those with wages of one yuan or more will have their wages increased by 20%, and those with wages of two yuan or more will have their wages increased by 10%; (4) The factory shall allow each person to buy one yuan of firewood from the company every month, totaling 100 city catties (according to the factory, the broken firewood is contracted by Song Yougen and Wang Guisheng, who were injured in the labor strike, and the price sold to employees is 60 catties per yuan, and the price sold to workers is 30 catties per yuan); (5) Cancel the year-end bonus, and instead issue two months' wages at the end of the year; (6) The pension will be issued in advance at the end of this month; (7) Wages will be paid as usual during the strike period.

The education expenses of his eight-year-old daughter will also be provided by the hall.

### French Commercial Counselor to China Returns to Shanghai Praises the Progress of the Yunnan-Vietnam Transportation The Number of Freight Increases Tripled Progress Will Be Made in the Near Future

Mr. Shelley, Commercial Counselor of the French Embassy in China, traveled to Chongqing and Kunming at the beginning of the year and lived in mainland China for three months. He recently returned to Shanghai. He expressed the following views on the transportation situation between Yunnan and Vietnam: The Yunnan-Vietnam Railway is now an important export channel for China. The railway has recently increased its freight volume due to the surge in China's import and export trade. The freight volume has tripled compared to before, with more than 600 tons per day. To pass through the undulating single-track railway, this is actually a significant amount of transportation. A highway parallel to the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway is currently being built. When this project is completed, transportation between China and France will be further improved, and the economic relations between the two countries will be strengthened.

### The Result of the Fluctuation of the Legal Tender Exchange Rate Was Beyond the Expectations of the Japanese Side The Value of Japanese Currency Followed a Terrible Decline The Japanese Domestic Economy Has Been Shaken The Tokyo Asia Development Board is Anxious

According to Japanese sources, the Tokyo Asia Development Board held an emergency meeting the day before yesterday to discuss the Shanghai legal tender issue. As a result, no specific plan was found. However, it unanimously expressed anxiety about the following two matters. The Japanese side originally thought that after the legal tender exchange rate changed, the Japanese currency would definitely increase its purchasing power in China. However, the fact is just the opposite. The exchange rate between the Japanese yen and the legal tender is still the same as before the legal tender exchange rate changed (still one Japanese yen for more than 1.2 yuan of legal tender), and there is a trend of leveling off.

Japanese Influence

As a result, not only the purchase of cotton and other raw materials for industrial use, due to the fact that payment is pursued with legal tender, the Japanese yen's purchasing power in China is depreciated after being exchanged for legal tender. Even the military supplies that have always been purchased directly with Japanese currency do not show any signs of rising purchasing power. Especially the former will increase the cost of Japanese domestic products, stimulate prices, and further increase the number of goods exported. This is one of the points that the poets attending the Asia Development Board meeting are worried about.

Empty Funds

Secondly, some people in the Asia Development Board who built cars behind closed doors thought that the change in the legal tender exchange rate should be a good opportunity to promote the issuance of new "currency". However, Aoki Kazuo, who came to China with Abe and served as Abe's economic advisor, considering the tragic situation of the fake "Joint Reserve Currency," believed that the establishment of the fake "Central Bank" would not be successful without huge funds. The Japanese side must act cautiously. The people attending the Asia Development Board meeting were all stunned and speechless for a long time after listening to Aoki's opinions, which also shows their inner anxiety.

### British Women's Wartime Service Exhibition

The British women of this city, with fervent patriotism, have been diligently serving their motherland since the outbreak of the European war. According to a reporter from the Da Zhong News Agency, the Shanghai British Women's Association has decided to hold a wartime women's service exhibition starting at 10:00 AM on the 23rd of this month. The location is said to be at the Association's clubhouse. Six months ago, the British Women's Association launched a knitting and sewing mobilization, sending all the products back to the motherland as donations to the soldiers fighting the war, achieving excellent results. Therefore, in this exhibition, the styles of knitted goods and clothing will be the most exciting part. All members of the British Association in this city are expected to visit and provide their valuable critiques.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Denies Salary Increase for Staff

According to the Thames News, an important official of the Shanghai Municipal Council denied that the Council would soon announce a 20% or 25% increase in the salaries of all levels of staff. However, due to fluctuations in the black market exchange rate and the high cost of living, the issue of salary increases is likely to arise. The official also said that the appointment committee has not yet discussed the issue, and the proposal will only be submitted to the board of directors for approval when a decision has been made. He also denied that the Council would change the regulations for issuing pensions. Recent rumors claimed that the Shanghai Municipal Council staff, based on the length of their service, would be entitled to a total pension payout of [blank space] of the total amount. In reality, although there is a need for this, it has not yet been realized.

### (Note) (1) A Strange Person Indifferent to Rice Prices Soaring to 100 Yuan Per Dan (An)

In the past, when rice prices rose to fourteen or fifteen yuan per dan, everyone complained it was too expensive. Now that rice prices have risen to forty or fifty yuan per dan, people have no choice but to accept it passively. This is the inevitable consequence of the times, forcing people to this point. However, there is still a type of person who remains indifferent even when rice prices soar to one hundred yuan per dan, as if it has nothing to do with them. They are neither millionaires who do not care about the price of rice, nor rice merchants who become more anxious as rice prices rise. Instead, they are people suffering from stomach ailments, often in pain, unable to eat much or eat anything. When they do eat, it's like counting pearls, picking at a few grains and considering it done. They leave banquets early and are excluded from group meals. Originally, food is the paramount necessity of the people, but now, with reduced appetite and insufficient nutrition, their physical strength declines and their muscles waste away. Is it not pitiful?

Five-Minute Stomach Pain Relief Powder, the fastest cure for stomach pain, eliminates the root cause most effectively. Each packet is two jiao, available everywhere.

People with stomach problems, if they can cure their ailments and eat well, will immediately feel that rice prices are too expensive, and it's not easy to live in Shanghai.

Available at all tobacco shops and pharmacies in Shanghai. General Manager: Shanghai Minghua Trading Company.

### Price Stabilization Committee Should First Set Maximum Price Limits; French Concession's Price Stabilization Plan Announced; Citywide Salary-Earning Class Calls for Salary Increase

The French Municipal Council's Committee on Fair Prices for Daily Necessities held a plenary meeting on May 9 in the French Municipal Council's meeting hall. Reports were submitted by the Rice and Grain Subcommittee, the Retail Subcommittee, and the Coal Subcommittee. After discussion, the following plans were adopted: (1) adopting measures to improve the situation in the rice and coal markets; (2) reorganizing the vegetable markets in the French Concession; (3) controlling bread prices. These plans have been submitted to the French Consul General for approval. Regarding the reorganization of the vegetable markets in the French Concession, according to a reporter from the Da Zhong News Agency, the authorities have decided to designate a portion of the Eight Immortals Bridge vegetable market for bidding by merchants to operate as a place for selling food items for foreigners.

Price Marking Should First Set Price Limits

With soaring prices in Shanghai, the concession authorities, recognizing the hardship of the people, have stipulated that businesses must mark their prices. This matter has not yet been fully implemented. Accountant Cao from the Shanghai Public Trust Office has recently proposed that the Shanghai Municipal Council first set maximum price limits for price-marked transactions to prevent price increases from being endless. Recently, the concession authorities, because the business of redeeming pawned items on behalf of customers in the market helps thieves to dispose of stolen goods, have banned it. They earnestly urge the Shanghai Municipal Council to take similar action against speculative trading in essential goods. If this is not done, the livelihood of the common people and the tranquility of society are at risk. Currently, the skyrocketing prices of various essential goods are all due to the machinations of speculators. Those who use the people's basic necessities as a means of getting rich are definitely not tolerated by society. The concession authorities, for the sake of maintaining public order, should strictly ban them. It is reported that the French Concession authorities have decided that all retail stores must mark the prices of their goods. (1) The price displays must be visible from the road. (2) Whether goods are displayed inside or outside the store, the price tags must indicate the unit and price in Arabic numerals, with the area of the numerals not less than three centimeters. The price marking measures will be implemented soon.

Unreasonable Coal and Flour Price Increases

The coal cinder market in this city has attracted much attention since it began pricing in US dollars. Although the industry has used euphemisms to cover it up, the reality is clear. According to a reporter from the Da Tong News Agency who inquired at the market yesterday, coal cinder prices are still marked in US dollars. However, due to the depreciation of the US exchange rate, the selling price has also decreased slightly in proportion. Yesterday, the selling price of coal balls was still eight yuan and forty cents per dan. Some knowledgeable people in the coal industry also believe that this coal cinder price increase is unreasonable and are working to lower it, so the market price will fall back to appease public anger. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, after receiving a letter from the Machine-Made Noodles Industry Association requesting that the price of flour be suppressed, immediately sent letters to the Fuxin and Fufeng companies to investigate. The current exchange rate reduction only affects the settlement price of newly ordered American wheat and does not affect the flour already produced and waiting to be sold. The members of the association are all small-scale businesses, and their business is also related to the people's essential food. Their urgent appeal has its reasons. The Chamber of Commerce believes that in these difficult times, all merchants should seek mutual assistance and have compassion for society. The association's request to authorities for strict prohibition, if everyone can be self-aware and self-governing, there is no need for this. Therefore, from the standpoint of merchants, we earnestly discuss with your company a method that takes both sides into consideration, hoping for a candid response.

Citywide Call for Salary Increases

Another report states that due to recent price increases of about 20% to 25%, there are widespread rumors that Shanghai Municipal Council employees will receive salary increases. A high-ranking official of the Council said that due to the sudden rise in the cost of living in the city after the dramatic changes in the exchange market, it is extremely difficult for salaried people to maintain their daily lives. Therefore, he believes that the issue of salary increases will enter a serious stage. However, the Council authorities have not yet discussed this issue. As for the issue of layoffs, he denied any changes in principle. Regarding the increase in pensions, the Council has not discussed it recently. However, based on the current situation, he admitted that although the Council's economic situation is not affluent, it is necessary to increase subsidies for all levels of staff whose income is based on the city's currency due to the increasing cost of living, especially for the general wage-earning class in the city. As a result, signs of unrest within the concession are becoming increasingly evident, as can be seen from the labor disputes in recent days. The labor unrest has not yet been resolved, and the Chinese Tin Foil Factory at 168 Shanhai Pass Road in the Public Concession, the Qianqiu Socks Factory at 45 Alley 195 Caishi Road in the French Concession, and a sock factory at 19 Alley 326 are all demanding wage increases due to the difficulty of maintaining a livelihood, as it is indeed difficult for workers to make a living.

Foreign Women Discuss Prices

A reporter from the Da Zhong News Agency has learned that the Joint Committee of Women's Groups in this city has decided to hold a lecture meeting on the 15th and 16th of this month at the French Club to make a detailed analysis of the livelihood issues of residents in this city. They will express their opinions from the perspective of women. To balance optimistic and pessimistic views, Mrs. Holbert's speech will be titled "The Situation in Shanghai Is Not as Deteriorating as Imagined." In addition, Mrs. Coder's piano solo, humorous talks provided by the American Women's Association, Mr. Stipper's sports speech, and Mr. Tang Xixue, editor of "Shop News,"'s analysis of Shanghai nightlife will be the most interesting programs. As for the more formal speeches, there will be Mrs. Bayer's "Shanghai Food Supply," Dr. Mao's "Low-Priced Nutrients," Miss Glance Young's "Fuel Issues," Miss Hyde's "Family Budget," and Miss Flock's "Inside Story of the Family Budget," etc. After the lecture meeting, the Joint Committee of Women's Groups will hold another meeting to decide on the steps and methods for rewarding the winners of this year's "Cleanliness and Hygiene" essay contest and awarding bonuses.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Closed for One Day on the 13th

The Shanghai Municipal Council and all its departments will be closed for one day on the 13th of this month (Monday).

### Rampant Actions of Fake Police; Arbitrary Detention of Chinese and Western Police Officers; Detained for More Than Four Hours Without Reason; Released After Police Station Sent Personnel to Negotiate

Two Chinese and Western police officers from the Jing'an Temple Police Station were detained by the fake police in the "badlands" area of western Shanghai for four hours last night. A reporter learned the details as follows: Chief Inspector Gulobokov of the Jing'an Temple Police Station, along with a Chinese detective, went to a house near Avenue Road on Jessfield Road at 11 PM last night to investigate a case related to encroachment. Unexpectedly, several suspicious plainclothes Chinese men suddenly appeared at the house and obstructed the performance of duties by the concession police officers. After arguing for a while, Gulobokov and the Chinese detective went to a nearby fake police substation to report the incident. They were taken to the Shanghai West General Bureau of the fake police at 13 Jessfield Road and forcibly detained. After hearing the news, the Jing'an Temple Police Station immediately sent Chief Inspector Macfarlane to negotiate. It was not until 3:30 AM yesterday that the fake police station released Gulobokov and the Chinese detective, and a fake officer solemnly apologized to Chief Inspector Macfarlane. Major Bowen, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Police Department, said yesterday that the matter would not be formally protested because the fake police station had apologized to the Chief Inspector. However, the Police Department will investigate the incident and then decide whether it is necessary to take other steps.

### A Westerner Returns to Shanghai and Talks About the European War and Far Eastern Commerce; Observations on Future Naval and Air Battles (Continued)

A country that can control the ocean can attack any country, although it is not necessarily guaranteed victory, but if it can attack, it has a hope of victory. The British Navy is four times stronger than the German Navy. Britain has 2,079,863 tons, France has 815,000 tons, and Germany has 541,123 tons. Since the Battle of Jutland on May 31, 1916, when the German Navy was defeated by the British, it has not yet recovered. All they can use is submarines. Although submarines are very effective in sinking ships and killing people, the British have greatly improved their effectiveness by using destroyers to escort convoys. It is determined that the Great War cannot be won with submarines, and this time it is unlikely to be different. And Britain's naval blockade policy poses a great threat to Germany. Now, the losses suffered by both sides since the start of the war are listed below.

Germany (Pocket Battleships) Losses already confirmed include the Admiral Spee, unconfirmed include the Admiral Scheer, (Heavy Cruiser) Blücher, (Light Cruiser) Karlsruhe, and four others, (Destroyers) about twelve, (Submarines) no less than fifty or sixty.

Britain (Large Battleships) Loss of HMS Royal Oak, (Aircraft Carrier) HMS Courageous, (Light Cruisers) four, (Destroyers) ten, (Submarines) five.

If Germany wants to win, it must destroy the British Navy, but looking at the above record of naval losses on both sides in the past, the proportion of losses for Germany is six times heavier than for Britain. Currently under construction, Germany has four 35,000-ton giant battleships, two 19,250-ton aircraft carriers, five 10,000-ton heavy cruisers, four 8,000-ton light cruisers, and dozens of submarines of about 1,000 tons. On the British side, there are nine 35,000-ton to 40,000-ton giant battleships, six 23,000-ton aircraft carriers, twenty-three 5,450-ton to 8,000-ton light cruisers, sixteen 1,920-ton destroyers, four 2,650-ton mine-laying ships, and dozens of other auxiliary ships of various types. From this perspective, Britain's naval strength, which is four times stronger than Germany, can not only be maintained but also increased, because Britain's shipbuilding industry is developed, and the time required for construction is shorter than in Germany, thus increasing the rate of shipbuilding. So, since the German Navy is far inferior to the British, can it destroy the British Navy with its air force? I'm afraid there is little hope. Britain dares to fight Germany because they know that a blockade can bring Germany to its knees, and no matter what, the German Air Force cannot destroy the British Navy. The German Air Force is indeed stronger than the British and French. But under the conditions of well-maintained air defense equipment, the effect of bombing is not very great. The German Air Force flew 560 miles to bomb British naval bases, even bombing four times a day, and the results were minimal, with planes often shot down by anti-aircraft guns. Moreover, they have to be attacked along the way. As for the army, although Germany's military strength is relatively strong, it is not superior enough to start from the Maginot Line. Because the strength of the attacker must be at least three times greater than that of the defender. Time is on the side of the Allied forces. Britain and France do not want to attack Germany's Siegfried Line. Although Germany is in favor of a quick decision, it will not have any effect if it attacks from this side.

With the European war progressing in this way, large-scale naval and air battles are inevitable in the future. Although the German Air Force has a slight advantage, the results of air combat are not very effective, and the British Navy is so unbreakable. The outcome remains to be seen in the future!

### Multiple Ships for Overseas Transport; Direct Route from Shanghai to Ningbo

All Approved; Convenient for Travelers

The Shanghai-Ningbo liner route was previously blocked by the Zhenhai port closure, so ships could only anchor outside the port to load and unload goods and passengers, which was inconvenient for merchants and passengers. The company also suffered considerable losses due to delays in the shipping schedule. In mid-February of this year, the German firm Rulun Shipping

Gaodeng Ship

With a total tonnage of only over 500 tons, was specially permitted by the authorities to be the first to implement direct navigation to Ningbo, passing through the Zhenhai port blockade and docking directly at the north bank of the river. Later, the Italian firm Roche Shipping

Changde Ship

Represented by Jufeng Customs Brokerage, and the Hualun Shipping company's Ruitai Ship successively joined the direct route. The last time the Ruitai Ship returned to Shanghai, it entered the Wusongkou port, and at night, due to negligent navigation, it collided with a stone reef, damaging the ship's hull. It was then repaired at the Hefeng Shipyard. The work has now been completed. Yesterday at 2:00 PM, it left the dock and sailed to the Bund Garden Wharf on Beijing Road, scheduled to resume sailing today at 4:00 PM, directly to Ningbo. Previously, the Shanghai-Ningbo liner route ships, Haifu, Baoli, and Hana,

Sanshao Ship

Were also small and planned to participate in the direct route, but were not approved. Later, they changed to the Shanghai-Ou route instead. Now it is reported that the Shantai Ship of the Portuguese firm Far East Company, which is managed by the Zhengde Steamship Company, has been approved by the authorities and is scheduled to sail to Ningbo today at 4:00 PM, directly to the north bank of the river. Also, the German firm Lihe Shipping

Haifu Ship

After previously requesting direct navigation to Ningbo with the Baoli and Hana ships and being denied, changed to Wenzhou. It has also been approved to join the Shanghai-Ningbo direct route. The ship is currently still in Ou and is scheduled to return to Shanghai from Ou today, and resume sailing on the Shanghai-Ningbo route next Tuesday (14th) at 4:00 PM, directly to the north bank of the river. The Tongyi Shipping company's

Jiangsu Ship

(Flying the British flag) has also been specially permitted by the authorities to join the Shanghai-Ningbo direct route. It is reported that the ship is now managed by the Daxin Shipping Company, and the date of the opening voyage is currently being planned. As for the issue of the Baoli and Hana ships joining the direct route, since the Haifu has been approved, the two ships also have hope. The number of direct route liners on the Shanghai-Ningbo line is gradually increasing, making travel more convenient.

### Wire Mesh Removed in Front of Longquan Garden on Nanjing Road

The Shanghai Municipal Council's Police Department previously set up wire mesh frames in the Nanjing Road section of various alleys to maintain security within the concession, blocking them off. However, the businesses and residents in the alleys were greatly inconvenienced, and they petitioned the Municipal Council to remove them quickly. After the Council received the petitions, it sent personnel to conduct on-site surveys and investigations. As a result, it ordered the removal of the wire mesh frame in front of Longquan Garden (i.e., the east end of the Xindaxiang Building) on Nanjing Road and moved it back 20 meters to facilitate traffic. The residents of the alley unanimously praised the move.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Economic Committee Member Xi Yushu Discusses Shanghai's Price Issues; Speculation and Investment Are Different, With Different Safety and Dangers; To Maintain Public Morale, Salaries Must First Be Adjusted

Xi Yushu, a member of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Economic Committee, recently made the following remarks: Shanghai's commodity prices are soaring, worse than ever before. The price increases by several percent up and down in a single day, indicating that it is not a sudden increase in intrinsic value but rather the result of hoarding and speculators competing for profits. If this trend is not curbed, the situation will deteriorate further. If we want to curb this terrifying situation, we must earnestly implement the following measures:

Curb the Rising Trend

Regarding curbing the rising trend, the current concession authorities have already established a method for marking selling prices. However, this method is ultimately passive for merchants who disregard the people's livelihood. Today, the price increase situation of businesses is endless, with two percent today and three percent tomorrow. If this unreasonable increase is allowed to continue freely, commodity prices throughout society will inevitably fluctuate, and the livelihood of the common people will become more difficult. Therefore, in order to curb the rising trend, it is necessary to further stipulate that if businesses need to raise prices due to increased costs, they must apply in advance and go through the approval procedures before they can raise prices. In this way, commodity price marking can be completely reasonable, and the rising trend can be curbed invisibly. Otherwise, relying solely on marking selling prices will allow businesses to change them freely, and the authorities will have no control over the drawbacks.

Discourage Speculation

Regarding discouraging speculation, society has already made moral appeals, but speculators continue to emerge one after another, as rampant as ever. However, extremes will inevitably beget their opposite, so we must be cautious. It is necessary to once again faithfully advise these heartless and sick people that Shanghai has become a state of abnormal development. There are many consumers and few producers. Speculating for profit can indeed bring wealth, but within tens of square miles, the rich will become richer, but they are ultimately a minority, and the poor will become poorer and increasingly numerous. The foundation of commerce is built on the consumption of the majority. If the majority of the people are turned into creatures waiting to die in a dry ditch, then the wealth of the rich will be transformed into frozen rocks, and at the same time, the enjoyment of their property will disappear, and the security of their property will not be guaranteed. Therefore, we must ask the speculators to wake up. Therefore, we hope that speculators should change their occupation to investors, nurturing and storing resources, and society will have a continuous vitality.

Adjust Salaries

Regarding adjusting salaries, it is even more important. Commodity prices are rising extremely, the currency is depreciating invisibly, and the general salary-earning class is suffering greatly. In the past, a monthly salary of fifty yuan was considered sufficient, but now, even one hundred yuan is not enough. Commodity prices rise while human value falls; this is a contradiction. As a result of continuous commodity price increases, capitalists greatly benefit, so they should also increase the salaries of their employees to ensure that they have the ability to maintain their livelihoods. It is unkind to be rich but not benevolent, which is truly undesirable. It is heard that various banks have stipulated that the increase in the commodity price index will be used as the ratio for subsidies in order to solve this problem. We hope that the authorities in various industries will also follow suit and implement this method so that the general standard of living can be rationalized, which will not only increase work efficiency but also stabilize social order.

### Shanghai Merchants Can Pay Income Tax in the Interior

Avoid Exchange Fee Losses

The various trade associations in this city received a notice from the Income Tax Office of the Ministry of Finance yesterday, stating that since Shanghai is an important commercial port in the country and has become like an isolated island since the National Army moved west for strategic reasons, the merchants of Shanghai are still actively paying various national taxes according to law, enriching the financial resources for the war of resistance and laying the foundation for the final victory. Their patriotic enthusiasm is commendable. However, according to reports from various parties, due to the current inconvenience of transportation, the proceeds from goods sold domestically by Shanghai merchants, or the net profits of branch stores set up in the interior, are mostly

Delayed in the interior and unable to be remitted to Shanghai on time. National taxes are indeed a legitimate levy, but the difficulties of merchants must also be considered. In 1939, Sichuan and Shanghai had agreed that Shanghai merchants could pay income tax in Chongqing, which was very convenient for Shanghai merchants. In order to consider the difficulties of merchants, this office has decided to expand the scope of application of this method of paying taxes. All income tax and profit tax payable by Shanghai merchants can be paid in any place in the interior based on practical convenience. Those who have branch stores in the interior should pay taxes in the interior uniformly.

National treasury revenue is originally consistent, but merchants can enjoy the convenience of tax payment and avoid exchange fee losses, which is very beneficial. This is to consider the difficulties of merchants and also to encourage their patriotic enthusiasm. We sincerely hope that Shanghai merchants will understand this intention. In addition to separate orders, this order is issued to inform your office and to forward it to the merchants in Shanghai, etc. Because this office previously received reports from Shanghai merchants that because they had branch stores or affiliated stores in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces, it was difficult to remit funds, and the payable taxes were overdue,

In order to consider the difficulties of merchants, it was agreed to entrust the Chongqing and Kunming Central Banks to collect the taxes of this office on behalf of it. First, the Shanghai merchants would fill out the report forms and send the accompanying documents to this office for storage and verification, and apply to this office for a certificate letter, which would be sent to Chongqing or Kunming. The income tax payable would be sent to the local Central Bank for collection on behalf of it, and the receipt would be obtained and sent to Shanghai. Then, the number of the receipt and the date of receipt would be copied to this office for audit. It has been followed and merchants have found it convenient. Now that the scope of application of this method of paying taxes has been

Approved for expansion, in the future, if the income tax and excessive profit tax payable by the various industrial and commercial enterprises in this city are delayed in any place in the interior and are inconvenient to remit to Shanghai, they can first report the tax payment location to this office and submit the income or profit report form and supporting documents. This office will issue a certificate, which can be used to pay taxes to the Central Bank in that location, which is more convenient than before. This is a special letter to inform you, and I hope you will check and forward it to various industries.

### British Imperial Airways Company Resumes Hong Kong-Bangkok Air Route

The Hong Kong-Bangkok air route operated by British Imperial Airways Company, which was previously suspended for some reason, has now resumed operations. According to news from the Post Office, the company has resumed flights to facilitate passenger and postal traffic between Hong Kong and Bangkok. Flights arrive in Hong Kong from Bangkok every Thursday and Sunday, and depart from Hong Kong to Bangkok every Wednesday and Saturday.

### Public Concession Police Crack Down on Opium Trafficking Syndicate: Large Quantity of Opium Seized from Customs Brokerage Firm; Geng Yu'en and Other Perpetrators Arrested Pending Investigation

The Narcotics Division of the Public Concession Police, led by Detective Ye Yusi, Detectives Li Shugui and Liu Zhaonian, and Officers Zhao Baosheng and Guo Shouxin, received intelligence that opium was being trafficked in Room 252 of the Southern Hotel at 462 Jiujiang Road. They dispatched officers with 32 yuan in legal tender to purchase a small amount of opium. After verifying the authenticity of the substance, they immediately

Rushed to Make Arrests

Inside the room, they apprehended Gao Guodong and a woman named You Jianhua (24 years old, from Zhenjiang, residing at No. 2 Gaoshou Lane, Xinzha Road; manager of the Tao Tao Xiangdao Agency). They seized sixteen taels of opium. The 32 yuan used by the police to purchase the opium was also found on You's person. She was taken to the police station and confessed that a larger quantity of opium was hidden at the Renhexiang Customs Brokerage Firm, located at 293 Hankou Road, Room 221. Officers raided the location, arresting tea server Liu Hongfa and seizing 149 taels of opium. Investigations revealed that the opium belonged to Geng Yu'en (also known as Yu'en), who had

Brought it from Shandong to Shanghai

Police then proceeded to Room 236 of the Yingbin Hotel in Qinghe Lane, Zhejiang Road, where they apprehended Geng and Jin Zhuo'an, also known as Xiang Kongzhi. Subsequently, they proceeded to No. 56, Lane 336, Tiantong Road, where they apprehended Ji Luosheng, the main culprit and owner of Renhexiang. Several more taels of opium were seized. Yesterday morning, all the suspects were escorted to the First Criminal Division of the Special District Court, where police attorney Ru Baoyi charged them with opium trafficking under Articles 5 and 9 of the Opium Suppression Regulations, requesting that they be punished according to the law.

Geng Yu'en Confessed

That he had grown the opium himself in Shandong Province. Because it could not be sold in Shandong or Qingdao, he brought a portion to Shanghai for sale. Lacking a place to store it, he temporarily entrusted it to his old friend Ji Luosheng, and so on. Judge Feng Shide questioned the other defendants, then ordered a postponement for further questioning.

### Large-Scale Child Trafficking Ring Detained for Investigation

The Jiading Road Police Station recently cracked a large-scale child trafficking ring in the area of 355 Baoding Road, Hongkou. They apprehended ten suspects, including Ling Rongsen, Ling Zhangshi, Dai Lushi, Wang Lishi, Wang Wushi, Zhuge Qianshi, Lu Wenzhong, Zhuge Chun, Cui Tengshi, and Wang Zhangshi, both male and female. They also seized clothing, shoes, and hats taken from the trafficked children as evidence. Investigations revealed over a hundred cases. The suspects were handed over to the First Special District Court for prosecution. The court has already tried and sentenced the perpetrators to severe penalties and fines. Because the French Concession Police discovered that the suspects were also involved in multiple child trafficking cases within the French Concession, they requested that the Second Special District Court record the case. On a prior day, Detective Yan Jinwen was dispatched to transfer the suspects and the clothing evidence from the First Special District Court to the French Concession Police Station for detention. Yesterday, they were escorted to the First Criminal Division of the Second Special District Court, where police attorney Chen Ming presented the case and requested that the defendants be detained pending further investigation next week to clarify the details of their crimes, before bringing them to trial. Judge Sun Pengxian briefly questioned the defendants and approved a postponement for further investigation. The defendants were returned to police custody pending further investigation.

### Robbery Gang Targeting Women's Jewelry Busted

Notorious robbers Zhang Lansheng (26 years old, from Suzhou) and Wei Xipeng (36 years old, from Jiangyin) have recently been targeting women's earrings, watches, and handbags outside bustling areas of the French Concession. On the 8th of this month, at noon, a British woman, Qin Sheng, was riding in a rickshaw carrying a handbag containing 250 Hong Kong dollars, five HSBC bank checks totaling over 4,000 yuan, as well as medals and badges. As the rickshaw passed the Dongxin Bridge intersection on Avenue Edward VII, Zhang and Wei suddenly robbed her and fled without a trace. The British woman reported the incident to the relevant McLand Police Station, which dispatched detectives to apprehend Zhang and Wei the other day and recover the stolen goods. The suspects confessed that the gang's headquarters were located at No. 88 Rue Cardinal Mercier. The police arrested nine accomplices: Wang Hongsheng, Wang A'ren, Gao Mingxiu, Zhang Weiyi, Zhao A'si, Zhou Gengsheng, and Zhuang Yuebo. They also seized a large quantity of stolen goods, including suitcases, soap, candles, towels, cigarettes, tin foil, clothing, watches, and earrings. Yesterday, all suspects were escorted to the Second Special District Court for investigation. Judge Miao presided over the hearing and ordered them remanded in custody pending further questioning.

### Presiding Judges of Civil and Criminal Divisions of the Third Branch of the High Court Receive Threatening Letters Accompanied by a Mauser Pistol Bullet; Both Courts on High Alert

Since a prior day, the French Concession Jiangsu High Court Third Branch and Second Special District Local Court have been under increased security, with the French Concession Police adding detectives and joining with judicial police to conduct thorough checks on litigants, lawyers, and all persons entering and leaving. Details were previously reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that the cause was a threatening letter received by Xia Quande, Presiding Judge of the Civil Division of the Jiangsu High Court Third Branch. Xia resides at a certain address on Avenue Paul Beau in the French Concession. On a prior morning, an unknown person delivered a [extremely] Western-style book to Xia's residence. Xia's family accepted it. That evening, when Xia returned home, he examined the book, puzzled as to the identity of the sender. He discovered a hole cut into the book, containing a threatening letter and a Mauser pistol bullet. Judge Xia reported the matter to the court, which requested the French Concession Police to provide increased security to prevent any unfortunate incidents. It has been learned that Wu Tingqi, Presiding Judge of the Criminal Division of the High Court Third Branch, also received a similar threatening letter this morning.

### Dispute Over Telephone Line Removal

Yu Chenglong, 22 years old, from Suzhou, residing at No. 3, Lane 339, Rue Bourgeat in the French Concession, recently retained lawyer Lin Qingchi to file a lawsuit in the Civil Division of the Second Special District Court against Lin Xiangchen (41 years old), from Ningbo, currently residing at No. 14, Lane 109, Route Remi, seeking a declaration of his right to use the telephone. The plaintiff's complaint stated that the defendant had rented a three-story building from the plaintiff in June of the 27th year of the Republic [1938] and had a telephone, No. 77886, installed. At the end of November of the same year, the defendant vacated the premises. The telephone was then transferred to the plaintiff for continued use. The plaintiff paid a telephone deposit of 15 yuan and an installation fee of 10 yuan. Subsequently, the plaintiff paid the monthly telephone bills, as evidenced by receipts from the telephone company. Recently, due to the increasing number of telephone subscribers in the area and the limited number of telephone lines, leading to high demand, the defendant, seeking to profit from an opportunity to earn a large commission, wrote to the telephone company requesting the removal of the telephone, obstructing the plaintiff's use. The plaintiff, upon learning of the transfer, protested to the telephone company and raised an objection. Therefore, the plaintiff requests a legal mediation to declare the plaintiff's right to use telephone No. 77886. The court, based on the complaint, convened a hearing yesterday morning, presided over by Judge Chen Ziguan, summoning both parties for mediation. The plaintiff, accompanied by his lawyer, appeared in court and recounted the events. The defendant also appeared with lawyer Yang Sicheng, denying that any transfer had taken place. Since the parties could not reach an agreement, the court declared the mediation unsuccessful, and the plaintiff will file a formal lawsuit with the court.

### Taiyuan Kerosene Company Manager Embezzlement Case

Wang Jingzhi and Wang Yifu, from Jiangbei, and Wang Jingzhi's son-in-law, Zhu Xiaofeng, jointly opened the Taiyuan Kerosene Company in Hai'an, Jiangbei, with Zhu serving as manager. Subsequently, they discovered that Zhu had embezzled a large sum of public funds, amounting to between 10,000 and 20,000 yuan. Wang hired a lawyer to report the case to the Laozao Police Station, which arrested Zhu and handed him over to the First Special District Court, charging him with embezzlement. Judge Feng Shide repeatedly investigated the case. Because the parties were related as father-in-law and son-in-law, he instructed them to first seek an out-of-court settlement regarding the ancillary civil lawsuit. If the defendant could find a way to repay the embezzled funds, his sentence might be reduced in the future. Yesterday morning, Judge Feng continued the hearing, but the civil lawsuit could not be settled. He instructed the police and the lawyers for both sides to present their arguments and concluded the hearing, awaiting judgment.

### Gambling Dens in Nanshi Attempting to Reopen After Closure

Sanxin Gambling Den Opened Yesterday

According to a news agency, gambling dens were previously opened one after another in the Nanshi area. However, Father Rao, the head of the refugee area, strongly opposed them because they were harmful and would affect the order of the refugee area. A certain party then ordered them to be closed. Now, after more than a month, the gamblers are suddenly stirring again, trying every means to revive their business in order to make a profit. It is learned that the Sanxin Gambling Den on Minguo Road officially opened yesterday. However, because there are not many residents in Nanshi, and most of them are poor, there are few gamblers and business is slow.

### Defu Foreign Firm Indigo Theft Case: Three More Accomplices Apprehended

In the case of the Defu Foreign Firm warehouse at 161 Sichuan Road, which lost indigo worth 26,849 yuan at the beginning of last month, the Central Police Station, acting on a tip, apprehended five suspects, including Zhou Mengqin, on the 7th of this month. They were handed over to the First Special District Court for interrogation and pretrial detention. During a postponement, the police, based on the suspects' confessions, proceeded to No. 4 Shiyuli, Haifang Road, and apprehended Chen Heting and Jiang Yongling, two clerks in the Defu Foreign Firm's lending department (suspected of carrying out the theft). Chen then led the police to the Yongyu Paint Store at No. 305 Chengdu Road, where they apprehended Chen Kaichao, suspected of receiving stolen goods. Yesterday morning, all suspects were handed over to the First Special District Court. Judge Feng ordered them to be remanded in custody, awaiting a joint trial with Zhou Mengqin on the 17th of this month.

### Japanese Authorities Order Closure of Shanghai West Opium Dens

Effective Date: End of This Month (31st)

Following the closure of gambling dens in the Caojiadu area of Shanghai West, it is now reported that the Japanese authorities have decided to order the closure of all opium dens in the area by the end of this month as well. The unemployed hoodlums who depend on them for a living have been actively plotting a new plan. They are now trying to open new establishments in the Nanshi area. However, after moving to Nanshi, they will have to be renamed "Sales Outlets." Smokers will also have to purchase "Smoking Permits" in order to smoke openly, otherwise they will be arrested.

### Local News Briefs

Since the completion of the new Shanghai Savior Church on Zhao Zhu Jiao Road in the French Concession, over five hundred male and female parishioners have been attending services every Sunday. This Sunday, the 12th, at 10:00 AM, the church will host a lecture by the newly appointed Yunnan-Guizhou Bishop Zhu Youyu, with special music. Those wishing to hear Dr. Zhu's discourse are welcome to attend the service.

Famous painter He Tianjian, whose previous residence was subjected to rent increase by a secondary landlord and unwilling to continue living there, recently moved to No. 1283 Avenue Foch.

Over the past month, prices in Shanghai have skyrocketed, especially for clothing. Yesterday, the Jiucheng Trading Company of this port on Sichuan Road, entrusted by a major merchant, offered a large quantity of its accumulated domestic silk at a low price, selling each bolt for only about 40 yuan.

### Publishing News Briefs

The 33rd issue of Volume 1 of the Sino-American Weekly was published this morning, featuring many specialized articles such as "The Theoretical Basis of Moral Resistance and Construction" and "The Problem of Stabilizing Shanghai Prices," with extraordinary content.

Li Wei-xin's "Li's Social English," written by the Principal of Shanghai Yingzhuan School, has been reprinted and is still selling for one yuan in national currency. General distribution address: 34 Rue Brenier de Montmorand.

### Weather Report

The Xujiahui Observatory's meteorological report at 4:30 PM yesterday stated: Sunny and foggy conditions around Shandong, with southeast to southwest winds. Cloudy and rainy conditions in this port and the East China Sea, with northeast to southeast winds. The highest temperature was 64.4 degrees Fahrenheit and the lowest was 57.9 degrees Fahrenheit. On the same day last year, the highest temperature was 89.2 degrees Fahrenheit.

### A Clever Method of Swindling

Outside the capital city of Beijing, there is a temple called the White Cloud Temple. Inside the temple, there is a bridge. Every day, on both sides of the bridge's approach, two Taoist priests sit facing each other, each with a large paper money offering in front of them. As tourists pass by, each takes out a single coin from their purses and throws it from a distance. Those who can throw the coin into the hole in the paper money are said to be blessed, so many try their luck. In reality, the two Taoist priests are merely using this as a pretext to deceive people. Regardless of whether the coin lands in the hole or not, the priests collect all the money. When the weather is clear and there are many tourists, they can earn several thousand coins each day. This has been going on for a long time, and those familiar with Beijing are accustomed to it, so it is nothing unusual. Yesterday, a wealthy man visited Beijing for the first time and, finding it novel, threw several dozen coins, occasionally hitting the target, but mostly missing. The priests collected all the money. The wealthy man mentioned this during a dinner conversation, so I record it here to add to the amusement.

### A Thief Leaves Behind a Lantern

A certain commissioner of the Hanguan gate in Suzhou was away from home on official business for the night. That evening, a hole was dug in the wall of the commissioner's bedroom, and silver, clothing, and other items were stolen. The county magistrate was notified and inspected the scene. It was discovered that the thief had left behind a lantern with the characters "Shuiguan" [Water Gate] on it. The county magistrate filed the lantern as evidence and ordered a strict investigation. The Hanguan and Shuiguan gates each have their own patrols, originally for the sake of preventing petty thieves. Yet the Hanguan gate was robbed, and the thief's lantern had the words "Shuiguan" on it, which people found quite curious.

### Mothers and the Cross (1)

Women have their weaknesses, but they also have their strengths. For thousands of years, China has valued men over women, failing to acknowledge the position of women in the family and the nation. This is one of the reasons for China's weakness. Now we are actively promoting the strengths of women and raising the status of women. The reason I have chosen this topic for discussion is for this very reason. The cross is a symbol of sacrifice, a symbol of love. A mother's duties are also a work of sacrifice and love. Christ is the center of the Church, and the mother is the center of the family. Jesus' mother saw something different from what others saw when she stood next to the cross. Others saw only a tragedy, but she saw what love truly is and reflected on what her own love was like. Jesus, looking down at his mother from the cross, saw that she did not weep and also showed an undying love. Mothers and the cross can be spoken of together, with the following similarities: (1) "Mother" implies individual justice. I remember someone said, "God cannot be everywhere, so he created mothers for the world." This statement may seem somewhat naive on the surface, but in essence, it says that God is in "Mother." Where there is no knowledge of God or understanding of theology, God always speaks to people through the love of "Mother." A mother's duties are to show people the meaning of Jesus' forgiveness of sins and suffering on the cross. Before a child has a concept of God, he recognizes his mother. He sees his mother's personality as only slightly inferior to that of an angel. If a mother does not meet the child's ideal, this is the starting point of danger for the child. The main purpose of family education is to maintain this standard and make the mother the person in the child's ideal. (To be continued) For detailed study, please send a letter to P.O. Box 1227.

### Roosevelt's Bodyguard

— Li Shaozhong

There is a man in America whose small photograph often appears in newspapers, but his name is never published. This mysterious figure is none other than the most trusted bodyguard of U.S. President Roosevelt. Whenever President Roosevelt appears in public, this mysterious person never leaves Roosevelt's side, staying within a few feet of him.

This confidant bodyguard of President Roosevelt is named Thomas Qualters. He has curly hair and blue eyes. He is Irish and used to be a policeman in Boston. When President Roosevelt stands to sing the national anthem, he always holds onto Qualters' arm with one hand (see photo). Every time Roosevelt is in a car slowly driving through a busy city, Qualters is always standing on the running board of the car. In the reception room of the Presidential Office in Washington, D.C., there is a broad-shouldered young man with bulging trouser pockets, often pacing peacefully, as if wandering aimlessly. That is Qualters.

Qualters' official title is the protector of the president's life. Protecting the president's life is the collective work of the entire "Secret Service," but Qualters has private responsibility. He accompanies the president to the office in the morning and follows the president back to the White House at night.

Usually, Qualters wears a uniform made of thick wool. But when the president holds diplomatic tea parties, you can see Qualters wearing a beautiful and elegant tailcoat, with a white bow tie, standing a few steps away from the president. If any inexperienced foreign high-ranking diplomats at the diplomatic tea party carelessly put their hands in their pockets or cross their arms and walk close to the president, Qualters will immediately follow them, tapping the diplomat on the shoulder with his finger in a very restrained manner, telling him to put his hands down.

Qualters is known for his agility in the White House. Once, when the president's car was driving through a city street, a passerby waving a shoeshine cloth rushed towards the president's car. Of course, the cloth would make people suspect that he was holding a weapon from a distance. Qualters immediately jumped off the running board of the car, ran forward a few steps, and, using a feint, knocked the man into a roadside ditch. Later investigations revealed that this person was originally a boxing champion. Qualters explained to people: "People often become very hurried when they want to run close to the president's car, which is really a very bad mistake. We "know their faces but not their hearts" for everyone, so we don't know their motives for wanting to run close to the president. Since the establishment of the American "Secret Service" in 1902, the protection of the president's life has never failed. We certainly hope to maintain this honor."

### The Great Undertaking of the Chinese Nation

— Pin Pin

I was deeply moved, as if struck by a great stimulus, when I happened to read the chapter on China in "A Philosopher's Travel Diary" by Estonian writer Kai Ki-se-ling. Like Bertrand Russell of England, Kai places great hope in our country, believing that China can accomplish earth-shattering feats, which is far superior to the apathy of our general populace.

When natives discuss their own country's affairs, it's either lamenting and hating its shortcomings, or boastful and arrogant, rarely able to offer objective, fair, and calm analyses, like foreigners do, even though they inevitably have some distance and unfamiliarity. Kai's research on China certainly stems from some "curiosity," but most of it contains profound and unique insights. The most outstanding aspect is that she possesses a comprehensive concept that encompasses everything. We can use this concept to understand the various changes and facts of our country, and it is very accurate.

For example, in Kai's expectations, we see this sentence: "The nature of the Chinese people, on one hand, represents a rest in the development of a past era, and on the other hand, it is clearly a harbinger of future ideals." This is an extremely accurate conclusion. China has a heavy past, upon which our entire achievements are engraved, and at the same time, our entire failures are also engraved. We should let the failures rest, that is to say, not repeat the same mistakes; however, we should promote our achievements and allow future ideals to be nurtured within them. We are in an era of transition, especially today, which therefore requires our greatest efforts to complete the great undertaking of the Chinese nation for itself and for all mankind.

According to Kai's opinion, the Chinese nation has two prominent characteristics: (1) Non-individualism; (2) Good at remembering. Kai obtained the above conclusion based on these two concepts, and we can also recognize these two concepts.

The meaning of the first characteristic is this: we are not as individualistic as Europeans, which is clear to everyone; what we express is formalism, that is, everything must have a neat and orderly form, and all things must conform to principles and systems; this result has led our country to produce abstract thought, because abstract thought places the greatest emphasis on the unity of form. Is this non-individualistic characteristic good or bad?

Kai believes that this characteristic has both good and bad aspects. The bad is that it hinders individual creation, neglects the deepest parts of life, advocates mediocrity, and does not strive for the realization of ideals. But its value is not diminished by this, it represents an important form of future ideal society—harmony between people. The future society will never again go into individualism, but will go on to supra-individualism, which is very similar to the characteristics of China. Discarding the bad, first cultivating self-perfection, and then developing towards the point of "integration," the ideal of society can be achieved. It is truly the juncture of "rest" and "premonition," we should be aware.

The second characteristic, "good at remembering," is the opposite of "good at innovation," so we often have conservatism, and other Eastern nations often do so as well. Because we are good at remembering, lifestyles become more enduring, and cultural forms do not decline quickly. Kai believes that if Western culture stops "progressing," it will fall, and its maintenance depends entirely on continuous new inventions. This is a crisis, or the entire thing will be eliminated due to a temporary loss of balance. Western culture is moving too fast, but without foundation; the remedy is to use our "good at remembering." Of course, we are a bit too conservative to the point that there is too little progress. In the future, we should be a little "better at innovating." "Discarding shortcomings and taking strengths," the integration of Eastern and Western cultures will also be the day when the fate of mankind turns.

For ourselves, for mankind, let us build our great undertaking starting from today.

### The Bewilderment of Middle School Students

— Lin Yan-de

Having spent six precious years of time and energy, I passed the final hurdle (graduation exam) last winter and left the gate of middle school. Due to economic reasons, I don't plan to go to higher education and want to find a job. In this overstaffed society, when a few junior staff members are recruited, there are often five or six hundred people applying. How hopeless it is to find a job! The shadow of graduating and immediately becoming unemployed immediately struck my heart. Recently, I was fortunately hired by an old major company, but I have to feel the seriousness of the employment problem of the entire middle school graduates and the inability of the courses learned to match the application.

Half of the reason for the unemployment of middle school graduates is due to the defects of the social system, but the inadequacy of middle school education itself is hard to shirk the blame. In theory, middle school education is a preparatory stage for going to university, but in fact, it is quite difficult for ordinary parents to support their children until high school graduation. Those who go to university are only a minority of the minority, and the employment of those who do not go to higher education naturally becomes a problem.

I don't want to overly criticize middle school education, but the courses in ordinary high schools are really too heavy. They include Chinese, English, mathematics (including algebra, trigonometry, solid geometry, analytic geometry), biology, physics, chemistry, history, geography, civics, etc. In the teaching of each subject, teachers turn on the record player, and students listen to lectures, take notes, memorize, and cope with exams, taking getting scores as satisfaction. In general, the experimental equipment of schools is completely lacking, and the best students only memorize equations. The commercialization of schools is the biggest defect. Teachers sell knowledge to make a living, and students embrace Buddha's feet at the last minute, cheat for scores to get qualifications, which is the most heartbreaking thing. Therefore, it is natural that middle school graduates are almost incapable of anything and run into walls everywhere.

Recently, the Ministry of Education announced the revised teaching hours table for junior and senior high schools. High schools are divided into groups A and B from the second year. Group B focuses on preparing for employment, and the amount of curriculum is slightly reduced. From the third year, schools can set up simple vocational subjects (such as commerce, bookkeeping, accounting, typing, agronomy, cooperative societies, etc.) as appropriate, and students can choose to learn one or two kinds (please see the education news column of this newspaper on March 22). This has already improved the middle school curriculum, and I hope that all schools in Shanghai will immediately comply. At the same time, the enrichment of equipment, the goodness of teachers, the improvement of mathematical methods, and the selection of teaching materials are all essential matters. I especially hope that in the third year of high school, students will be given individual guidance regardless of whether they plan to go to higher education or find employment. The summer vacation is about to begin, and wise educators and school authorities will have good guidance for the lost sheep wandering at the crossroads! (Que Chou)

Historical Talk

### Lessons of History

— Shi Shu

History certainly does not repeat itself, but precious history is enough to encourage our courage. When I read in the modern history of Turkey that General Kemal resisted the Greek army, after eight years of continuous warfare, most of the territory of Turkey was occupied by the Allied Powers, and the seaports were blockaded, and no military supplies were imported. At this time, a part of the Turkish people were pessimistic and disappointed, and members of Congress and the army also appealed for peace. At that time, the situation in Turkey was indeed similar to the situation in our country now. For example, the seaports were blockaded, and a very small number of people compromised for peace. But we can say that the situation in our country now is much better than the situation in Turkey at that time. For example, our army and people have never been pessimistic and disappointed. Although Turkey had such bad phenomena, General Kemal fiercely opposed all cowardly actions and prepared to endure the final struggle. He aroused the positive spirit of the congressmen, encouraged the soldiers to kill the enemy on the battlefield, and tried to comfort the suffering of the people in the inland. The opportunity he was waiting for finally arrived. On August 25, 1922, a general offensive was launched, pressing the Greek army, capturing key points, and winning victory after victory. The Turkish army then drove straight into Smyrna. At this time, the enemy turned to the Turkish army and demanded a truce. As a result, the Turkish army negotiated peace under strength, and Turkey recovered its old territory in Europe.

Finally, I would like to introduce a few wise words of General Kemal to the people of the country: "Our nation will not perish; unless the surface of this earth is not strong enough to carry the weight of our coffin, our nation will perish."

### Interview with Dr. Yin, Director of Leren Hospital (1)

Specially Equipped with Giant X-ray Machine to Implement Tuberculosis Prevention Movement

The Leren Hospital on Gu Ba Road has recently hired staff members from various departments who are knowledgeable and capable, and has increased equipment to refresh the interior, as reported in the previous newspaper. Yesterday, the reporter visited Dr. Yin, the director of the hospital, and he expressed his views on the anti-tuberculosis movement as follows:

"My country's annual mortality rate ranks first in the world, and the number of deaths caused by pulmonary tuberculosis is particularly large. The losses suffered by the people are actually greater than any disaster. If this continues, the harm to the future of the nation is extremely worrying! Shanghai is narrow and densely populated, and the air is bad, which is a place for the reproduction of tuberculosis bacteria. The plan to prevent and contain it is urgent.

Using X-rays to examine the lungs is an important measure for preventing tuberculosis, which we almost all know. However, in order to obtain good results, it is necessary to have a new giant X-ray machine. The presiding physician must be knowledgeable and experienced. For example, in the initial step of lung examination, the physician must properly adjust his eyesight before the examination, and he must be very careful during the examination. Even so, the smallest nodules are still easy to ignore. The only accurate method is photography, and the time, power, and the size and age of the person being examined are all related. The time for developing photos and the temperature of the potion must also be appropriate. Only in this way can excellent photos be obtained for diagnosis. The diagnostic aspect is especially important. If a disease is diagnosed as no disease, the patient's treatment opportunity will be missed. If no disease is diagnosed as a disease, the mental state of the person being examined will suffer the pain of "unwarranted." Our hospital has specially hired experts to preside over the diagnosis. If there is any doubt, we will ask X-ray experts to study together to ensure that the diagnosis is accurate, so that we can treat the symptoms and expect twice the result with half the effort.

Entertainment

### Carlton's Ideal Lineup

— Wang Chu

The Yifeng Opera Troupe, now led by the veteran Carlton, has a fairly strong supporting cast. I am now drafting an ideal lineup in order to form a more perfect troupe. The leading role should belong to the veteran Carlton, supplemented by Jin Suqin and Zhang Yipeng, who will hold the second and third leading roles respectively. Among the Kun operas in the South, Jin Ling can be called the best. She has both appearance and performance singing skills, and is known for her progressive Kun operas. If she cooperates with Zhou's style, it will be a perfect match.

As for Zhang Yipeng, he is also a leader in his field. Anyone who has watched his operas such as Sipingshan and Beihuzhou knows that he is clean and neat, agile, stable, and accurate in his opening fight scenes. With this person's assistance, Carlton can achieve the effect of green leaves setting off the peony.

It is more appropriate to invite Yu Sulian back to her old home to hold the third leading role. It is not enough for her to stand alone, but it is still a good supporting role to have her under his command; her singing and performance skills have already become mainstream. Others, such as Liu Binkun, are also known as Carlton's good generals. Liu was originally a basic actor in Yifeng Society, but later left due to some reason and joined Huangjin, where he was quite popular with the audience. Every time he appeared on stage, the applause was like thunder; it is a pity that his voice cannot be loud. If he had Ma Fulu's voice, it would not be an exaggeration to call him the number one comedian in the North and South.

Now, if he returns to Yifeng Society, there will be many good cooperation. In the original lineup of Yifeng Society, Gao Baisui held a special leading role, hoping that he would play more roles such as copper hammers. He can perform this type of role quite well. Gao's voice is very good, and his singing can be called Huang Zhong Dalu. It is hoped that he will study more and specialize in copper hammers. Gao himself may not be willing to do this, but looking at Yifeng Society, only He Yingkui is a professional copper hammer actor, but he cannot handle the more important roles in the play, so Gao is the only choice.

There is no good young male actor in the South. I have seen Liu Wenkui play the role, and he can still handle it. He can play all the young male roles. The other roles, such as Wang Lanfang's Huadan, can be compared with Furongcao; Lu Lingyun's Jiazi Erhua, Zhang Yueting and Liu Ting's sweeping old male actors, are all hard-core and can add luster to the leading actors.

There is Li Changshan, who is also a member of Yifeng Society, but his name is not very famous, and his role is very low. This person's art is very good, and he can play both male and comedian roles. It is heard that he and Carlton are brothers of the same teacher. It is hoped that he will be promoted more and not let him be unknown, so that his talent will not be buried.

If the above-mentioned ideal lineup is adopted by the authorities and realized, it will undoubtedly be more welcomed by the audience.

### Prelude to "Ah Q"

— A Han

"The True Story of Ah Q" not only laid the ideological direction of my country's new literature for Mr. Lu Xun, but also undoubtedly laid Mr. Lu Xun's authority in the world of literature. Because this is an anti-feudal work full of justice, many playwrights in our country have had the courage to put it on the stage, but because Mr. Lu Xun was deeply afraid that once it was put on the stage, it would violate the original meaning, he always expressed his opposition. Later, after Mr. Lu Xun passed away, many playwrights could no longer bear it, so Mr. Tian Han, Yuan Muzhi, Xu Xingzhi and other gentlemen all adapted "The True Story of Ah Q" into scripts. I remember that the Shanghai Drama Art Society once performed "Ah Q" last year, which was Mr. Xu Xingzhi's script.

Recently, after "Xin Meimu Xiang," Zhonglu also plans to stage "Ah Q," which was adapted by Mr. Chen Yu. Chen Yu doesn't need to be introduced. He is also a first-class playwright in China, so his consciousness is naturally very accurate. Zhonglu attaches great importance to this play. Not only is it actively rehearsing at the moment, but in terms of the lineup, it can be said that the entire troupe of Zhonglu is mobilized. All the important actors include Zhao Shu as Zhao Taiye, Wu Chunzhen as Zhao Taiye's wife, Ge Xin as Zhao Qiye, Tang Di as Zhao Xiucai and the prison director, Huang He as Lu Da, Tang Qi as Kong Yiji and Xu Erhu, Wang Wei as Liujin girl and little nun, Lin Na as Bayi's wife, Sun Jinglu as Qijin's wife, Lan Qing as Wu Ma, and Liao Fan as Wang Laihu and Hongyanjing A Yi, etc.

In the past, Zhonglu often adopted the A and B system for each performance, but now it is because it is not enough to allocate, and some have to play dual roles, which shows that it is a large-scale performance. Among them, the protagonist Ah Q is played by director Ji Jingbo. His proficient acting skills and fluent vernacular have long been famous in the mainland. Shanghai seems to be relatively unfamiliar, but Boro in "Ge Nengniang" and Bai Cishan in "Two Worlds" have also left a deep impression on the general audience. In my opinion, he will be quite successful in playing Ah Q. The whole play is divided into five acts and takes about three hours to perform.

Teapot Song Talk

### Brief Commentary on the First Performance of Suo Lin Gui by Guan Yanqiu (Part 2)

— Su Shaoqing

Advantage 3 In the last scene, Zhao Shouzheng asked Xue Ma (ie Xue Xiangling,) why she was crying when she saw Suo Lin, there was no seat at first, and after answering a few words, she ordered the maid to set up a seat, and then asked a few more words, and moved the seat to the guest seat, and then asked a few more words, she knew that she was indeed the benefactor who gave the treasure in the past, so she changed the seat to the upper seat, and added the maid's cicada playing, which was very interesting, but the maid's words "Wood can generate fire..." were rude and inappropriate, and can be deleted.

Weaknesses There are as many as six or seven comedian roles in the whole play, and the gossiping is too verbose, which can be merged and saved to clear the clues. Also, Xue's playing games with Lu Gongzi in the garden takes too long, and the audience feels bored, so it should be reduced later.

Now let's talk about Yan's singing. Yanqiu's singing skills are unique. In the past two years, they have become more precise. In this play, the Er Liu board and flowing water sections in the scene of meeting and giving, such as the oblique wind blowing fine rain, two points diagonally down from above, each with force, Pu can use the Yinping Jue Ao high tune, each sentence is lifted up, like the Yu Chu font, thin and hard, the cavity is also unique, singing this kind of cavity, I know it takes the most effort, because each word is lifted up and sung. There is a sentence at the end of the two chopsticks singing in the garden, suddenly rising from the bottom to the highest point, and then falling back to the main one. This kind of singing method is very strange to the ear, and can be called extremely new; is it like using dangerous rhymes in writing poetry? In the Er Liu board of the reunion scene, the "original board" is added with the "crying head", and the tone of "my son's mother" and "my son" is like Nanbangzi and changes the tail, which suddenly feels new. Wang's school has a crying head in the Er Liu of Changting, which Qingyi has never had. In short, the whole play is extremely complicated, and there is no sentence that is not new. Once this play comes out, it will overwhelm everything. Yanqiu wants to be realistic in her acting, and her vernacular is especially small when she is sad or ashamed. I think this may cause the audience below to not be able to hear clearly. I wonder if it can be changed to be louder?

### Ye Qiuxin and Qiu Yunyan Will Go to Pingjin Together Today

— Hai Sheng

Ye Qiuxin's niece, Qiu Yunyan (note, she is the daughter of the late actor Zhang Mingwu, originally named Xuezhen), is a rising Kun actor who is ambitious and wants to go to Beiping for further study. She happened to meet Qiuxin's opportunity to go to Tianjin, so they decided to go together. This time she went north to apprentice to Wang Yaoqing and Shang Xiaoyun, preparing to bury herself in hard work there. She does not plan to return to Shanghai in the short term until her art has reached a considerable level of achievement and she forms a troupe to perform. Qiu Yunyan is a beautiful and smart child. If she can truly study hard, she will always have her share in a bright future.
