### Fierce Battles in Southern Guangxi: Invading Japanese Troops Driven Back from Binyang; Japanese Troops Attempting to Cross the Yu River at Yongchun Repelled; Japanese Plane Bombing Qianjiang Area Shot Down

Qianjiang:  Japanese troops in southern Guangxi, realizing they are trapped and unable to advance or retreat, fabricated reports of Chinese troops attempting to retake Nanning to encourage Japanese soldiers to risk their lives in attacks.  The Chinese side anticipated this tactic and, using clever mobile strategies, dispersed the Japanese forces. Last night, the remaining Japanese troops advancing towards Binyang were encircled and annihilated. This morning, those Japanese troops repeatedly attempted to break through to join forces with Japanese troops on the Yongbin Road but were repelled by Chinese troops, resulting in many Japanese casualties. The Chinese forces then seized the opportunity to further tighten the encirclement. (3rd dispatch)

Guilin:  One unit of Japanese troops from Yong City attacked northward from Lundu near Yongchun on the 30th of last month. After a certain Chinese unit rushed to fiercely counterattack, the Japanese troops were unable to coordinate their front and rear.  One part was surrounded by Chinese troops on the riverbank near Yongchun, and another part retreated rapidly northeast. They were intercepted by Chinese forces in the Gantangxu and Daqiaoxu areas, suffering heavy losses with corpses strewn along the way. The remaining Japanese troops retreated to the vicinity of Binyang and were again surrounded on all sides by Chinese forces. (3rd dispatch)

### Chinese Muslims and Mongolian Troops Fight Against Japanese Invasion of Suiyuan: Mongolian Princess Personally Leads Troops into Battle, Muslim General Ma Hongbao Commands

Chongqing:  News received today from the Chinese side states that Chinese Muslims and Mongolian troops, under the command of General Fu Zuoyi, commander-in-chief of Chinese troops in Suiyuan, are jointly resisting the Japanese invasion of western Suiyuan. Two young Mongolian princesses are personally leading cavalry from the eastern and western banners into battle. Princess Qi Songfang of the Western Banner is in her early twenties, young and beautiful, fully dressed in Mongolian attire, riding a warhorse, resembling the French heroine Joan of Arc. Princess Ba Yunying is a middle-aged woman. Both of them came to Chongqing some time ago. The Suiyuan Muslim army is commanded by General Ma Hongbin. Recently, a brigade of fresh troops under General Ma Hongkui, chairman of Ningxia Province, has arrived, greatly increasing their strength. These Muslim troops are known as the "Western Army" in Inner Mongolia. The Mongolian army consists of a division of Mongolian youths who have received military training in Nanjing, commanded by General Bai Haifang. General Fu Zuoyi, when meeting reporters at the battlefield headquarters, stated, "There is no Mongolian problem in Suiyuan, only a Japanese problem. Once the Japanese are driven away, the entire problem will be solved." General Fu is known as the "commoner general" among his subordinates because he shares hardships with his soldiers. He is also straightforward, and if the fighting is fierce, he will go to the front line to supervise the battle. Under his command are now more than twenty detachments of Chinese troops, Mongolian troops, and Muslims. (3rd Reuters dispatch)

Editorial

### Romania and the Anglo-German Economic War

Romania was originally a small country in Eastern Europe. During the Great European War, it withdrew from the war midway and almost perished. Fortunately, due to the eventual victory of the Allied Powers, it received Bessarabia from Russia and Outer Transylvania from Hungary as gifts from the 1919 Treaty of Versailles. Not only was its original territory preserved, but it also greatly expanded its area. Its national strength grew daily, and it seemed to have the ambition to dominate the Balkans. In the eyes of Britain and France, Romania was seen as a bulwark against Germany, a crucial point in maintaining the balance of power in Europe. However, today, Romania's situation is vastly different from what it once was. Since Germany annexed Austria, conquered Czechoslovakia, and compromised with the Soviet Union, establishing a non-aggression pact and dividing Poland, the aggressor's arrogance has soared, and Romania's security and independence have been seriously threatened.

Romania is very rich in natural resources. Its production of grains, wheat, timber, and other items is extremely abundant. Its oil production is the highest in Europe. Whether in peacetime or wartime, the importance of these resources is well known. Britain and France have been making every effort to court Romania and maintain contact with each other. Germany has been working to improve its economic relations with Romania, mostly with this in mind. Therefore, in economic terms, Romania has now become a arena for competition among the major European powers. Germany has intensified pressure on Romania, using the excuse of improving economic relations between the two countries to try to seize Romania's vast oil production. To win Romania's favor, it has expressed opposition to Hungary's claim to Outer Transylvania. At the same time, it is using its influence to try to prevent the Soviet Union from threatening Bessarabia in order to protect Romania's territorial integrity. Germany's efforts seem to have achieved some success. According to the recently established German-Romanian trade agreement, Germany can obtain 130,000 tons of oil from Romania each month, but there are still great difficulties in transportation. Britain has also recently increased its purchases of oil and grains from Romania to double what they were before the war. Therefore, the "economic war" between Britain and Germany in Romania can be described as vigorous and ongoing. In military terms, according to foreign news reports, rumors of German and Soviet troops moving near the Romanian border have been rife. There is no smoke without fire. German troops have also re-entered the province of Galicia in Poland, north of Romania, apparently to influence Romania's intentions. The Germans deeply believe that their lifeline is not on the Rhine River, but on the Danube River, so they have not forgotten their re-entry policy. In addition, with the war on the Western Front currently in a stalemate, the Maginot Line is where the main forces of Britain and France are concentrated. It is strong and impenetrable, so Germany may launch an offensive in the Balkan Peninsula to weaken the power that Britain and France retain in that area in the hope of achieving a surprise victory, which is very possible. In diplomatic terms, Germany's diplomatic offensive towards the Balkans has now begun. Its main goal is to obtain Romanian oil, but its overall function is to urge the Balkan countries to trade with Germany in order to reduce the threat of the Anglo-French blockade policy. Britain and France are well aware of Germany's intentions, so they are doing their best diplomatically with Romania, making every effort to court it so that Romania stays away from German control and increases the effectiveness of the blockade policy.

Romania now has to maintain traditional political ties with Britain and France, which are thousands of kilometers away, while also trying to deal with Germany and the Soviet Union, which are close at hand. Not only that, but surrounding it are Bulgaria, Hungary, and Italy, in addition to the threatening Germany and the Soviet Union. Bulgaria intends to acquire Southern Dobruja. Hungary is located between the three strong powers of Germany, the Soviet Union, and Italy, and currently has no choice but to take a wait-and-see attitude, but it may not give up its territorial claims. Its most likely action is to seek Transylvania or reclaim Outer Transylvania. As for Italy, it desires the entire Balkan Peninsula to be under its leadership, and Romania is of course included. Therefore, the difficulty of Romania's current situation is far greater than that of any other country in Europe.

The Balkan Entente conference opened on the 2nd of this month in the Yugoslav capital. The importance of this conference lies in proving that the existence of the Balkan countries is an important factor for European peace and order. The consensus of the Entente countries must be to advocate maintaining neutrality, cooperating in Southeast Europe to maintain peace and preserve the status quo, and to engage in constructive cooperation in peace with neighboring countries. However, although the participating countries have common intentions, they also have their own positions. This conference may not be able to promote the transformation of the countries into an indestructible entity. Therefore, no matter how great Romania's hopes for this, it cannot in fact resolve Romania's current difficulties. In short, Romania is now in a situation of being watched by hawks and tigers, with crises on all sides. How will it overcome the difficulties, turn danger into safety, make the country as solid as a rock, and make the countries of Southeastern Europe stand side by side outside the vortex of the war? This is what the world is watching with bated breath.

### Japanese Planes Bomb Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, French Political Circles Extremely Indignant; Japanese Local Authorities Disobey Government Orders; Hachiro Arita's Guarantees Prove Meaningless

Paris: When Japanese aircraft bombed bridges on the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway near the border of China's Yunnan Province and French Indochina on the 1st of this month, a passenger train was passing through the area, resulting in the death and injury of many passengers, including several Europeans. Japanese planes bombed the railway elsewhere on the same day. French political figures were surprised and indignant upon hearing the news, saying that this kind of thing has happened more than once. Previously, French Ambassador to Japan Henri had discussed it with the Japanese Foreign Ministry. The process was quite friendly, and Tokyo indicated that the Japanese Air Force's activities were exceptional actions by local military personnel in violation of the central government's authority. The French Embassy also got the impression that the Japanese Foreign Ministry was indeed unaware of the activities of the Japanese Air Force and expected the Japanese government to take appropriate measures to stop them. Unexpectedly, these violations of discipline continued to occur, which is rather strange. In addition, French Ambassador Henri had also stated that France and other countries had interests in the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway. American Ambassador to Japan Grew, because a large number of American goods were transported to the interior of China via this railway and American officials and foreign advisers in Chongqing used it as a route for communication, had protested to the Japanese government on the orders of his government against the bombing of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway by Japanese planes. How could it be that this protest had just been lodged when the bombing occurred again on the 1st of this month? Under these circumstances, it is clear that the Japanese government cannot make local military authorities obey its orders, and Foreign Minister Arita's guarantees regarding international trade in China in his speech yesterday are merely empty words.

Japanese Planes Kill French Women and Children

It is reported that the five French women and children were family members of French personnel on the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway. (3rd Associated Press dispatch)

### Chinese Fishing Boats Off Shantou Again Set on Fire

Hong Kong: The destruction of Chinese fishing boats and cargo ships by Japanese torpedo boats has recently resurfaced. On the 28th of last month, a cargo ship carrying sixty-three pigs and thirteen cages of chickens was sailing from Shanwei when it was intercepted by a Japanese motorboat. The Japanese threw all the cargo into the sea and ordered the crew into a discarded boat before setting the cargo ship on fire. Another cargo ship, which sailed from Hong Kong to Shantou on January 26 carrying 204 boxes of kerosene and 18 bags of rice, was intercepted by a Japanese motorboat between Shanwei and Shantou on the 29th. In addition to seizing all the cargo, the Japanese also chopped off the ship's masts. The crews of the two ships returned to Hong Kong yesterday and reported the incidents to the police station.

### Military Affairs Commission Announces One Week of War Situation, January 27th to February 2nd

Chongqing: A spokesman for the Military Affairs Commission stated that the Japanese troops on all fronts have been acting up repeatedly this week (January 27th to February 2nd). Under the fierce resistance of the brave and loyal Chinese soldiers, they have been dealt a fatal blow. The Japanese have suffered heavy losses in Zhejiang, Suiyuan, Shanxi, and Hubei. Their attempted advances have been completely shattered. The important achievements are listed as follows: The Chinese army in eastern Zhejiang has launched a series of attacks on the Japanese troops entrenched in Xiaoshan and Kanshanzhen. One route continued to capture important locations in Yuedazun along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. On the 27th, they charged into Xiaoshan city three times, engaging in fierce street fighting and killing countless enemies. Another route recaptured the stronghold of Yaqianzhen after Qianqingzhen. On the morning of the same day, they advanced towards the core Japanese positions in Kanshanzhen. Until noon, the Japanese broke through and fled in disarray. The town was then declared retaken. The remaining Japanese troops were forced to gather on the riverbank, forcibly requisitioning Chinese civilians to repair the Qianjiang Railway Bridge in order to ensure their safe retreat. After fierce artillery bombardment by the Chinese, the bridge was destroyed as soon as it was repaired. Another elite Chinese unit on the north bank, taking advantage of the Japanese rear being empty, launched a fierce attack on Hangzhou, charging into Gongchen Bridge, killing many Japanese and capturing more than ten Japanese soldiers and a large amount of military supplies. The Japanese were panic-stricken.

The Japanese troops in Suiyuan have been actively reinforcing their positions. On the 27th, they launched a large-scale joint ground and air attack from Baotou with more than 200 vehicles, advancing on multiple routes. One unit crossed the Yellow River and attacked Xinminbao to the south. The Chinese army met them head-on and fiercely attacked them. After two days and nights of intense fighting, the Japanese suffered countless casualties and retreated in defeat. Another unit of four large groups from south of Baotou crossed the river and attacked westward, but have been intercepted by the Chinese army at Zhaodawan, west of the four large groups, killing many. Another unit attacked westward along the Baowu Highway. The Chinese army fought bravely and is currently engaged in a bloody battle with the Japanese in the area west of Erdingzhangfang in front of the Wula Mountains. Another unit moved from the north, south, and west, advancing northwest in an attempt to cross the Langshan Wubulang Pass (north of Wuyuan). After a valiant interception, the Japanese suffered heavy losses and retreated in defeat. With the Japanese acting up in groups this time, the Chinese in western Suiyuan have strong forces and occupy an absolute geographical advantage, making it easy to wipe them out in one fell swoop. The fighting in Shanxi is still the most intense in the southeast. After the Japanese forces south of Huguan and Changzhi suffered a total defeat last week, they redeployed five to six thousand Japanese troops from Changzi, together with the remaining Japanese troops south of Changzhi, to launch another attack southwards this week. The Chinese army met them head-on, while simultaneously encircling Su Dian, Bao Dian, and Han Dian to cut off Japanese reinforcements, and launched a fierce attack on Huguan, even charging into Huguan city once, killing many enemies. Along the Changgao Highway, the Chinese army launched a night attack, striking directly at Changzhi. The Japanese situation was shaken. After Gaoping was recaptured by the Chinese, the surrounding strongholds were also recovered one after another. The communication of the remaining Japanese troops has been completely cut off, and they are becoming increasingly desperate. Since the Japanese suffered a crushing defeat in southeastern Shanxi, they gathered more than two thousand infantry, cavalry, and artillery from Xijiang, Fencheng, Jiexian, and Yongji in southern Shanxi to attack on multiple routes in an attempt to cover up their defeat. After being fiercely attacked on multiple routes, the Japanese suffered heavy losses and retreated in disorder. They are currently being pursued.

In central and northern Hubei, heavy snow has been falling since the 28th, and the snow has been falling more heavily on the 1st, with extremely cold weather. The Chinese army has been very active on both the southeast and southwest slopes of the Dahong Mountains, killing many enemies in the past few days. On the 29th, the Japanese gathered at Jushicen and Aijiajian and attacked the Chinese positions near Bailashu and Shandongjian, but were routed by the Chinese army. The Japanese reinforcements came under cover of the snow, but were attacked on their flanks by the Chinese army. The Japanese were unable to resist and retreated with heavy losses. They are currently being pursued. On the 30th, the Chinese army took advantage of the snowy night to launch a fierce attack on Yangzi, Sunqiao, Jingshan, Songhe Sanyangdian, and Pingba. The Japanese responded in panic, trying to stop the Chinese attack with flamethrowers, but all were ineffective. They suffered heavy losses, and the Chinese captured many spoils of war. In addition, the remaining Japanese troops who broke through in Suibei are still retreating in disarray from Zhehe and Xujia Dian to Anlu and Yingshan. They are being intercepted, encircled, and annihilated separately, killing many. After clearing out the remaining Japanese troops near Guojiazhai, part of the Chinese army went straight to Sui County. The remaining Japanese troops defended the city but dared not fight. A fierce attack is underway. Madong in Nan, Macheng, is still under siege by the Chinese army, and the Japanese have suffered heavy casualties. Another Chinese unit charged into Yangjiazhai, approaching the outskirts of Guangshui, cutting off the Pinghan transportation line and capturing countless spoils of war.

In addition, in Shandong, the Japanese attacking from Xintai were defeated, killing more than 300 Japanese troops. In eastern Henan, the Chinese army once again attacked Kaifeng Railway Station, pressing close to the outskirts of Baoxian, and defeating the Japanese troops who attacked Lianchengj from Tongxu and Qixian. In northern Henan, they launched a fierce attack on Qinyang and Bo'ai, killing hundreds of enemies. In northern Jiangxi, the Japanese army advanced on Gaoyoushi (northeast of Gao'an), but were defeated and fled. In northern Jiangsu, they charged into Guanyun and destroyed Japanese barracks and warehouses, as well as many Japanese puppet institutions. On the Qingyang River in southern Anhui, two large Japanese transport ships were destroyed. In southern Guangxi, they charged into Xiaodong and Nalan, continuing to recapture Nabai and Langxu, and repulsed the Japanese troops who were attacking Zhennanxu again, annihilating more than 2,000 Japanese troops. In eastern Guangdong, after recapturing Panlongshan and Wutagang, they took advantage of the victory to attack Chao'an, charging into the outer strongholds of Hailianshan, Guanchao, and Hong'an, capturing a large number of enemies. These were all the important achievements of the past week. (3rd dispatch)

### Saito's Question Angers the Military: The Trend in the Japanese Parliament Expands. The House of Representatives Resolves to Refer Saito for Disciplinary Action. Four Parties Propose a Motion of No Confidence in the Speaker.

Tokyo: The House of Representatives held its official meeting today, opening at 9:40 PM. First, Speaker Oyama declared, "Regarding Mr. Saito's speech, the speaker always considered it unstable, so the latter half of the shorthand record was deleted. This was an appropriate measure by the speaker. Furthermore, considering the content of Mr. Saito's speech in light of the current situation, there are regrettable aspects, and its impact is significant. Therefore, Mr. Saito is hereby referred to the Disciplinary Committee." Afterwards, the Diet permitted Prime Minister Yonai to speak. Yonai delivered a speech stating, "At yesterday's official meeting, the government had full faith in Mr. Saito's questions. However, due to the gravity of the situation, I will reiterate one thing clearly today: regarding the handling of the China Incident, the Japanese government has a firm and unwavering policy. We will certainly exert every means based on this fundamental policy to advance towards resolving the situation. "Subsequently, Army Minister Hata clarified the Army's views, stating, "The goal of the current incident is to restore peace in the East, realize good neighborly friendship among China, Japan, and Manchukuo, jointly combat communism, promote economic cooperation, and establish a new order in East Asia, manifesting Japan's founding ideal. I am confident that the benefits of the upcoming new order will fully compensate for the enormous spiritual and material sacrifices. It goes without saying that the million-strong Japanese army in China, as well as all officers and soldiers of the Army, are all carrying out their duties under this belief, advancing towards the goal of the 'Holy War.' I dare say that countless spirits who have died for this belief have faced death with composure, and have no doubts about the fundamental policy for handling the incident. However, it is regrettable that even today, there are opinions that harbor doubts about the purpose of the incident." Furthermore, Navy Minister Yoshida also stated, "The Navy is also advancing towards the goal of handling the incident under the same beliefs as the Army Minister. Any doubts about this from any quarter have extremely significant implications, and I hereby declare our belief." Finally, it was decided to refer Saito to the Disciplinary Committee. (3rd, Domei News Agency)

Tokyo: Regarding the issue of disciplinary action against Saito Takao for his inappropriate remarks, committee members from each faction of the House of Representatives raised two questions to Speaker Oyama at today's afternoon meeting of faction representatives: (1) When Speaker Oyama noticed instability in Mr. Saito's speech at yesterday's official meeting, why did he not issue appropriate warnings such as "caution" or "prohibition"? (2) Why did he allow people to read the shorthand record after yesterday's official meeting adjourned? In response, Speaker Oyama stated: (1) The reason for not prompting Mr. Saito's attention or prohibiting him was because Mr. Saito's speech represented his party and was therefore indirectly conveyed through the executives of the Minseito Party. (2) The reason for promptly deleting it from the record was because it touched upon matters subject to prohibition, hence its deletion. (3) The decision regarding Mr. Saito's punishment would be made after careful consideration of his qualifications as speaker, requesting understanding, and declaring that he himself would explain the measures taken regarding the issue at the official meeting, expressing his hope that members would pay sufficient attention to their speeches. After the statement, he presented the original text, requesting understanding from each faction. (3rd, Domei News Agency)

Tokyo: Although Mr. Saito went through the formalities of withdrawing from the Minseito Party on the morning of the 3rd, the attitude of each faction did not soften due to his departure from the party. They insisted on pursuing his responsibility. In particular, the Nakajima faction of the Seiyukai, the Current Affairs Comrades Association, the Social Masses Party, and a faction of the Seiyu Kuhara-kai strongly advocated punishing Mr. Saito. Each faction also intended to question Speaker Oyama for not prompting attention or prohibiting Mr. Saito's speech. Although Mr. Saito made many explanations and requested understanding at the faction representatives meeting this afternoon, the Minseito Party's secret Diet members meeting held a strong opposition to Speaker Oyama's attempt to punish Mr. Saito using his authority as speaker. On the other hand, the Seiyu Kuhara-kai and the Current Affairs Comrades Association were the strongest in advocating for the punishment of Mr. Saito. The progress of this matter is particularly noteworthy. (3rd, Domei News Agency)

Tokyo: As a result of discussions between Koizumi Matajiro and Tawara Sunichi of the Minseito Party and President Machida regarding the handling of the aftermath of Saito Takao's inappropriate remarks, they visited Mr. Saito's home at 8:30 AM on the morning of the 3rd, expressing their heartfelt feelings as friends and hoping that Saito would voluntarily resign from the party as the situation had reached this point. Saito immediately decided to leave the party and at 11 AM, together with Koizumi and Tawara, visited President Machida and key members of the party headquarters, apologizing for the trouble caused to the party due to his inappropriate remarks, and expressed his intention to withdraw from the Minseito Party to clarify his political responsibility. The Minseito Party immediately proceeded with the formalities for Saito's departure from the party. (3rd, Domei News Agency)

Tokyo: The Social Masses Party, the Nakajima faction of the Seiyukai, the Current Affairs Comrades Association, and the First Diet Members Club, among other four political parties, jointly submitted a motion of no confidence in Speaker Oyama on the 3rd, with the following reasons: (1) Judging from the proceedings of the Diet over the past three months, the opening of plenary sessions has been delayed daily due to the speaker's improper measures. (2) During Mr. Saito Takao's question and speech on the 2nd, which lasted for two hours, the speaker did not stop or caution him, which was the speaker's fault. (3) Although deleting shorthand records is within the speaker's authority, this is limited to deleting ten or twenty lines of text. Now, he has decided to delete two-thirds of a two-hour speech, which should have been consulted with the Diet. Therefore, the speaker's current actions exceed his authority. (3rd, Domei News Agency)

Tokyo: Asahi Shimbun believes that Prime Minister Konoe's declaration is the guiding principle of the Yonai Cabinet and should not be criticized. Therefore, it expresses extreme dissatisfaction with Saito, stating, "The Army was shocked by Saito's arguments, and all other political parties, large and small, have rebuked Saito. This is all Saito's own fault." However, according to Kokumin Shimbun, "Saito's request that the government demand territorial concessions and reparations from China is sufficient to represent the views of some financiers. Although liberals do not love war, they often make imperialistic demands during peace negotiations. Therefore, what Saito said is a counter-proposal for establishing a 'New Order in East Asia.'" According to the interpretation of the Nichi Nichi Shimbun, Saito's intention was to make the government withdraw Konoe's declaration and adopt a tough and resolute stance towards China. According to the newspaper, "Needless to say, from the beginning to the end of Saito's speech, all the members in the entire hall listened with bated breath." (3rd, United Press)

Tokyo: At the meeting of representatives from each faction of the House of Representatives held on the afternoon of the 3rd, it was agreed that the plenary session on the 4th would be adjourned and the plenary session would reconvene on the 5th. (3rd, Domei News Agency)

Tokyo: Regarding the question raised by Saito Takao (Minseito) in the House of Representatives on the second day of the adjourned and reconvened Japanese Parliament concerning the policy for handling the incident, it has aroused extremely profound and significant repercussions. The attention of the entire nation is focused on the plenary session of the House of Representatives on these two days. After Mr. Saito's question and speech on the 2nd, he immediately submitted a request to delete a portion of the shorthand record of the speech based on the reason that there were words that could be mistaken for misinterpreting his true intentions. Furthermore, he also fully deleted the latter half of the shorthand record upon the persuasion of Speaker Oyama and the leaders of the Minseito Party, and decided to clarify this at the plenary session on the 3rd. On the other hand, the Army, which bears a major responsibility in handling the incident, was extremely agitated, claiming that Mr. Saito's remarks insulted the purpose of the "Holy War." Therefore, Mr. Saito's voluntary measures were not worth considering, and his remarks had to be crushed. The government must also express its determination to establish a new central government centered on Wang Jingwei to complete Japan's unwavering policy of handling the incident.

Tokyo: Saito Takao, a leader of the Japanese Minseito Party, yesterday attacked the peace terms announced by Konoe Fumimaro, saying that the terms were "too arrogant and too idealistic." Saito's speech caused a sensation in the Diet. Saito expressed dissatisfaction that Konoe's announcement did not demand territorial concessions and reparations from China. He pointed out that Konoe's announcement did not require economic cooperation and did not restrict the interests of third countries in China. He also attacked Konoe's announcement, which allowed the withdrawal of all Japanese troops in China except for Inner Mongolia. Saito requested that the Prime Minister define the "New Order in East Asia" due to the binding nature of Konoe's announcement. He doubted the true power of the new "central government" in China and expressed the possibility that the "new government" led by Wang Jingwei might conflict with the National Government.

### Asama Maru Incident: Smooth Anglo-Japanese Negotiations; A Final Resolution is Likely

Tokyo: Regarding the Anglo-Japanese negotiations on the Asama Maru incident, both sides are giving final political consideration to concrete plans for resolving the issue. British Ambassador Craigie is seeking instructions from his home government based on the results of his meeting with Vice Foreign Minister Tani on the 1st. Furthermore, the Japanese side urgently awaits the resolution of the incident and urged it on the 2nd. Therefore, the next round of Anglo-Japanese negotiations after receiving the British government's response will be the decisive final talks on the Asama Maru incident. Its development is highly noteworthy. The next round of talks is expected to be held on the 3rd. If the Asama Maru incident can reach any conclusion at the meeting, it is expected that the results of the negotiations will be announced together with official documents from both the Japanese and British governments. The date will be on the 5th. (2nd, Domei News Agency)

London: The Anglo-Japanese negotiations on the Asama Maru incident are currently being conducted in Tokyo by Japanese Foreign Minister Arita and British Ambassador Craigie. British officials announced on the 2nd that the Anglo-Japanese talks on the Asama Maru incident are proceeding smoothly in Tokyo. The Japanese government's protest and the British government's reply on this incident will be released in the near future, but the date has not yet been determined. The Japanese refutation, which was handed over to Ambassador Craigie by Vice Foreign Minister Tani on the 1st, is expected to arrive before the night of the 2nd. (2nd, Domei News Agency)

### Washington Daily Criticizes Arita's Speech

Washington: The Washington Daily recently criticized Japanese Foreign Minister Arita's speech. The newspaper stated, "The moderation of Arita's speech shows the extent of Japan's concern about the current situation. Arita said that the Japanese side does not intend to exclude the interests of third countries in China, but this cannot be realized, because the desires of the Japanese military are extremely deep, and they often make fun of Japanese politicians, making them liars."

### Japan's Rice Harvest: The Quantity Has Increased Compared to Last Year

Tokyo: Minister of Agriculture Toshio Shimada and Minister of Colonial Affairs General Kuniaki Koiso recently reported at a Cabinet meeting that the total amount of rice harvested nationwide in 1939-40 reached 68,997,134 koku, an increase of 4.7% compared to 1938, and an increase of 11.7% compared to the average of the last five years. Therefore, even during the lean season, there is no concern about rice shortages. According to the estimate made on September 20th last year, the rice harvest for this year was slightly less than 65,000,000 koku. Although the actual quantity is larger than expected, the rice panic problem may not be completely resolved, according to various newspapers. Since 1918, the annual rice reserves until the new harvest have always been between 7 million and 8 million koku, while this year there are only 3,700,000 koku. Especially since the lean season is still far away, the government can take various necessary steps to increase rice reserves, either by importing from Korea and Taiwan, or by purchasing from Siam.

### Japanese Ship Tatsuta Maru Returns to Yokohama: Escorted by a Japanese Warship En Route

Tokyo: According to today's disclosure, the Japanese mail ship "Tatsuta Maru" arrived in Yokohama this afternoon from South America. A section of the journey was escorted by a Japanese warship, apparently to prevent another "Asama Maru" incident. According to Captain Ito, the ship encountered a Japanese warship shortly after leaving Honolulu and was escorted to Yokohama. When approaching the Japanese sea area, the Japanese warship sent a radio message wishing them "bon voyage" and then sailed away. (3rd, Reuters)

### Germany Commits Heinous Atrocities in Occupied Poland, Exterminating Humanity, Oppressing Patriotic Elements with Harsh Laws, and Innocent People Dying Number in the Millions

London: Political figures here recently talked about how the Polish Ambassador to Britain, Raczynski, visited Foreign Minister Halifax on the 31st of last month to present the various atrocities committed by German civil servants in the occupied Polish territories. The points mentioned have been confirmed by absolutely reliable information received by both Britain and France, which shows that the Polish people are in danger of being exterminated. Ambassador Raczynski also suggested that the governments of the United Kingdom and France jointly issue a letter to all countries in the world to expose the German atrocities to the world. The governments of Britain and France will probably do so, and will declare that once the liquidation period arrives, those responsible for these atrocities will be severely punished without any leniency. However, this kind of declaration must clearly state the various facts, and its form must leave no room for doubt. For this reason, the British and French governments are exchanging opinions on the content and date of the declaration. The information obtained by the British and French governments was not provided by secret agents of those countries, but by agents of various neutral countries. Although the names of these people cannot be published, they are all experienced, loyal, and reliable people. The information they provided has been verified one by one by the British and French governments, and there is no doubt about it. It is understood that between 2 million and 5 million people have died in the occupied Polish territories due to hunger, poverty, disease, abuse, or execution. The German authorities issued an order in October of last year stating that Poles who commit any of the following actions must be executed: (1) Those who participated in the rebellion in the provinces of Poznań, Pomerania, and Silesia between 1918 and 1919 (all of which belonged to Germany before the last European war); (2) Those who directly or indirectly caused German civilians to be detained before or after the outbreak of this war; (3) Those who set fire to the houses of Germans and Poles; (4) Those who directly or indirectly harmed Germans or their businesses; (5) All civil servants who are identified by Germans as having anti-German attitudes; (6) Polish civilians who directly or indirectly participate in military operations. Among them, regarding the third item, it is natural for the Polish army to burn down houses when retreating. Regarding the fifth item, Germans can regard almost all Polish civil servants as having anti-German attitudes. Regarding the sixth item, almost all Polish civilians in the German-occupied areas violated this provision. The severity of the German authorities' orders is evident here, and the violence of their execution is even more outrageous. Executions are often carried out without trial, and the numbers are extremely large. Most priests are forced to perform hard labor, and intellectuals who have not been executed are not allowed to make a living. Monasteries and villages throughout the country have been ransacked. Princess Radziwill, a Polish aristocrat, was granted a special pass by the Soviet authorities to safely pass through the German-occupied territories and arrive in Rome. It is said that the situation in the Soviet-occupied territories is much better than in the German-occupied territories. A German official, probably with a remaining conscience and a benevolent nature, told a neutral person that if the various facts of the German-occupied territories were known to the outside world, the people of all countries would definitely rush into the German embassy out of anger.

### Slow Progress in Soviet-Japanese Trade Negotiations

Moscow: The Japanese and Soviets are currently conducting trade negotiations here. Although the Japanese side says that the negotiations are progressing normally, according to various observers, it will probably be extended for one or two months. It is also said that both sides have already submitted drafts and separately assigned small committees to study how to reconcile them, but neither side is confident that an agreement can be reached. The Soviet side has expressed its willingness to make a comprehensive resolution of Japanese-Soviet relations. The Japanese side has also stated its willingness to resolve all outstanding issues item by item. So far, several outstanding issues have indeed been resolved. In addition, the Japanese side is also willing to demarcate the boundary from Vladivostok to Nomonhan for "Manchukuo" and "Mongolia," and plans to organize four joint committees to handle boundary demarcation and other various issues. However, Soviet newspapers are still competing to publish news of Chinese military victories and attacking Wang Jingwei as a "traitor." (3rd, Havas)

### Continued Disturbances in the Northwest Provinces of India

The Hague: According to news from London, the riots in the Northwest Provinces of India have lasted for several months and are becoming increasingly serious. Sir Kirnhan, the Governor of the Northwest Provinces, has now gone to the capital of India to report the situation of the local riots to Governor-General Lord Linlithgow. The British authorities are deeply worried about the situation in the Northwest Provinces of India. If it is not suppressed in time, it may spread to the Muslim residents of the Mujiabai Province. (3rd, Haitong)

London: Regarding the news published by British and European newspapers that the Soviet Union is threatening British India, Reuters' diplomatic correspondent recently heard from responsible parties that if the Soviet Union wants to threaten India from the north, it must pass through Afghanistan. However, there is currently no sign of the Soviet Union concentrating a large army on the Afghan border. According to qualified military experts, if the Soviet Union wants to invade Afghanistan or Iran from the north as the first step to undermining British interests in Asia, this move is more difficult now than before. Iran or Afghanistan have dangerous terrain that cannot be traversed by mechanized troops. Afghanistan is even more so, with bad roads and mountains. The Afghan people are inherently strong, good at guerrilla warfare, and firmly believe in Islam and oppose Western material righteousness, and they will inevitably rise up in resistance and make those who invade from the north suffer and be caught in a long-term war.

### Rome and Berlin Closely Monitor the New Situation in the Balkans; Italy Hopes that All Countries Will Reach an Understanding and Establish a Common Anti-Communist Barrier; Germany Expresses No Intention to Interfere in the Internal Affairs of Those Countries

Rome: After the opening of the Permanent Political Conference of the Balkan Entente countries today, political figures here have been paying close attention to it, saying that the results of the conference are extremely important for the future development of the situation in Southeastern Europe. The representatives of the Entente countries must have a long-term vision and jointly formulate good plans, so that the countries of Southeastern Europe can reach a general agreement in a short period of time. The proposal for these countries to form a group is not appropriate at present. However, in order to cope with the common crisis caused by the current war, they should cooperate with each other in major economic and political interests. The significance of this is not to establish a solid understanding, but to establish a common barrier to prevent the threat of Bolshevism, so that the current disputes between certain countries in Southeastern Europe can be more easily resolved. (2nd, Havas)

Berlin: The German Foreign Ministry's mouthpiece "Foreign Political Communication" published a lengthy article yesterday, commenting on the Balkan Conference, declaring that this Balkan Conference does not have any special plans to open up new paths, and will try to maintain its original principles, which is to maintain peace. The Balkan countries have killed and fought each other in the past, but now they have learned historical lessons and will try to avoid being drawn into the war. Germany expresses its sympathy for the legitimate demands that certain countries will make due to unfair treatment, but believes that these problems do not need to be resolved by war. Italy also agrees with this view. After Italy became closely related to the Balkans because of Albania, it hoped that Balkan peace could be maintained. The United Kingdom and France hold the opposite view. It can be seen from the fact that the United Kingdom and France concluded a contract with one of the Balkan Entente countries (referring to Turkey) at the beginning of the war to implement mutual assistance that the Allied powers' military goals in the Balkans are one of many. (3rd, Haitong)

Berlin: Well-informed political figures here, when commenting on the Balkan Entente Conference, stated Germany's attitude towards the Balkan countries, saying that Germany trusts peace and believes that maintaining the unevenness of Southeastern Europe is beneficial to the Balkan countries. Germany hopes to cooperate with the Balkan countries to increase the common interests of the countries, but Germany has no intention of interfering in the internal affairs of the countries. The news that Germany intends to be the "protector" of certain countries in the Balkan Peninsula has been proven by facts to be absurd. (3rd, Haitong)

Being Able to Eliminate Political Conflicts and Wars Can Hopefully Be Avoided

Amsterdam: According to Berlin intelligence, the German government is now paying close attention to the results of today's meeting of the Balkan Peninsula countries with great interest. A German spokesperson claimed that if a war breaks out in the Balkan Peninsula, the various goods that Germany urgently needs will not be delivered on time, and the period of delivery disorder will last for months or years. According to the opinions of neutral visitors, the Italian newspapers have repeatedly urged Romania to adopt a moderate attitude towards Hungary's and Bulgaria's territorial demands. Berlin is quite uneasy to see the Italian newspapers making this claim. The Berlin dispatch of this place's "Electric News" states that Hungary's and Bulgaria's demands must eventually be met, but they must be temporarily shelved during the European war. Political conflicts in Southeastern Europe may cause wars, but in any case, they will inevitably spread rather than be limited to one corner. The Italian political circles are also worried about Italy's true intentions in the Balkans. The details of the recent talks between Italy and Hungary have not been leaked to the outside world, but it is known that Italy firmly opposes any attempt by Stan material to spread British-producedism. (3rd, Reuters)

The Balkan Situation Relaxes Thanks to Italy's Mediation

Geneva: According to general opinion here, since the demands of Hungary and Bulgaria to revise the boundary have been eased, the Balkan diplomatic situation has greatly improved since September. This is due to Italy's mediation, because Italy's relationship in the Balkans has greatly increased since annexing Albania. Bulgaria's demands for land south of Dobruja have reportedly been set aside and will be dealt with again when the war ends. Bulgaria's relations with South Korea and Turkey are currently friendly, so Bulgaria hopes that its problems can be resolved peacefully. (3rd, Reuters)

### The Italian Ambassador to the United Kingdom Meets with the British Foreign Minister to Discuss the Balkan Issue

London: It has recently been learned that the Italian Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Bastianini, visited Foreign Minister Halifax yesterday to discuss the Balkan issue. Political figures have said that the Balkan Entente countries' Permanent Political Conference is being held in the capital of Yugoslavia, which shows that Italy is paying close attention to it. Italy is extremely willing for the Balkan Peninsula countries to strictly abide by neutrality and wants to prevent the intrusion of Soviet forces into this corner of Europe. This coincides with the views of the United Kingdom and France. However, in other aspects, Italy's attitude remains mysterious, especially regarding the policies pursued by Germany in the Balkan Peninsula, Italy has not yet stated its position. (2nd, Havas)

### The Second Day of the Balkan Conference: Focus on International Situation, Special Emphasis on Economic Cooperation, Seeking Solutions for Territorial Disputes

Belgrade: Reports indicate that the second day of discussions at the Balkan Entente conference focused on the overall international situation, with particular emphasis on economic matters. It is generally believed that the primary goal of the participating representatives is to restore trade throughout the Balkan region to at least the level it was during peacetime. A single official statement will be issued when the conference concludes tomorrow. All representatives have stated that their countries are determined not to be drawn into the vortex of war. Greek Prime Minister and Minister Mytaras, representing Greece, declared that the Balkan Entente has never been as strong and united as it is now. (Reuters, 3rd)

The capital of Yugoslavia: Greek Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Metaxas, currently attending the Standing Political Conference of the Balkan Entente nations here, made a brief statement: "After the first meeting, the views of the Entente representatives were consistent, which is unprecedented in previous conferences." Observers here commented that the Entente representatives agreed this afternoon to continue pursuing a policy of cooperation, but its scope should not exceed the interests of the Entente nations. Accordingly, any compromises that conflict with the territorial integrity and independence of the Entente nations are not considered by the Standing Political Conference of the Entente. During today's discussions, representatives of the four participating countries only presented reports on the policies pursued by their respective countries and their relations with neighboring countries. Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoglu also explained the situation of his conversation with Bulgarian Prime Minister Koseivanov yesterday. The meeting then decided to find a solution to Hungary's territorial demands to enhance the security of Southeastern Europe. According to observers, the conference will continue to discuss the following issues tomorrow: (1) Economically, efforts should be made to adjust the economic interests of the Balkan Peninsula countries, and to resolve various economic problems between these countries and major customers and suppliers. (2) Military issues: Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu will report on the reasons for his country's adoption of preventive measures in the military. (3) Issues between Italy and the Balkan Peninsula Entente nations. (Havas, 2nd)

Rome: "The Italian Daily" reported on the opening day of the Balkan countries' meeting in the southern capital, stating that the initial decision to hold the meeting was supposed to last only one hour, but it was extended for too long, and the discussion meeting did not begin until the afternoon. It is reported that Bulgaria will remain neutral but will not abandon its national demands. Bulgaria is prepared to cooperate with neighboring countries, but it is unwilling to join the Entente group until the Balkan countries have resolved their own disputes. (Reuters, 3rd)

### The Foreign Minister of the South Hosts a Banquet for Representatives; The Foreign Minister of Romania Will Deliver a Speech

The capital of Yugoslavia: Yugoslav Foreign Minister Marković is scheduled to host a banquet for representatives of the Balkan Entente nations this afternoon. At that time, he and Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu will deliver speeches on the progress of the conference. According to well-informed sources, the Entente representatives hold completely consistent views. (Havas, 3rd)

The capital of Yugoslavia: According to news from here today, during the Balkan Entente conference decided today, Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu stated that unless Hungary and Bulgaria immediately relax their demands on Romania, Romania will completely embrace the Soviet Union and Germany. According to those familiar with current affairs, Romania has already given Germany considerable substantial economic concessions in exchange for the Soviet Union's tolerance of Bessarabia. However, the Allied side believes that Romania's inclination towards Germany is not very reliable, because if King Carol places his country under German protection, it will become a German protectorate. Therefore, it is generally believed that Gafencu's attitude is nothing more than an attempt to make Hungary and Bulgaria relax their territorial demands on Romania. (United Press, 3rd)

Paris: After the opening of the Balkan Conference, well-informed sources here commented that although the Bulgarian government did not send observers to the southern capital to monitor the conference, after Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoglu held talks with Bulgarian Prime Minister Zaimpfanov yesterday, he deeply believed that Bulgaria's attitude towards the Entente nations was quite friendly and aimed at promoting a policy of peace. When the Entente Pact was established in Athens on February 9, 1934, all signatory countries recognized that Bulgaria's participation would be beneficial. Until the outbreak of the European war, these countries continued to try to win Bulgaria over and invite it to participate. At the same time, the Soviet Union also frequently courted the country, inducing it to cooperate and issuing statements saying that it was willing to assist Bulgaria in recovering the Dobruja province (now belonging to Romania). Although Bulgaria refused to cooperate with the Soviet Union, it did not intend to allow Germany to expand its power towards the Dardanelles through Bulgaria, but it also avoided joining the Balkan Entente. For this reason, the Standing Political Conference of the Entente still lacks the necessary factors to form a Balkan united front. (Havas News Agency, 2nd)

### On the Northeast Coast of England: Fierce Air Battle Between British and German Air Forces; Two German Planes Shot Down, One Heavily Damaged

London: German bombers attacked various locations on the east and northeast coasts today. The British Royal Air Force retaliated by shooting down two German planes and heavily damaging another. It is believed that the latter plane has crashed into the sea. One German bomber was shot down into the Tyne River, and another engaged three British fighters before crashing several miles from Dorking. This is the second German plane to crash in British territory during this war. There are conflicting reports about the survival of the crew members, with some saying that four people died and one was injured, while others say that there were more injured than dead. The injured have been taken to the hospital. The crew members of the plane that crashed into the Tyne River have been rescued by a ship. The details of the air battle are as follows: Two German planes first strafed a fishing boat with machine guns off the coast of Dorking. British fighters were immediately scrambled and a fierce air battle ensued. The planes sped through the sky, darting back and forth like shuttles, and the gunfire sounded like a shower of pearls. One German bomber was pursued by three British fighters from the sea. The three planes rose and fell, surrounding and attacking it. According to eyewitnesses, the German plane was visibly damaged, with black smoke emitting from its tail. The British planes continued to pursue it relentlessly. The German plane crashed into a field after being damaged. It almost touched the roof of a house as it fell. Another eyewitness saw the wreckage of the German plane and claimed that one crew member died and two were injured. Today, there were no air raid warnings. People on the cliffs clearly heard the last shots fired by the British planes and saw the British planes fly away without continuing their attack as the German plane crashed. Others described the German plane's attack on the fishing boat, saying that it first strafed with machine guns, then flew towards a lightship, circled it twice, and then returned to attack the fishing boat. The Air Ministry announced that British planes shot down an enemy plane off the Tyne River today. This is the third victory for British planes in intercepting enemy planes off the coast. According to responsible sources, after the German plane landed, the crew members set it on fire and destroyed it. According to a person in a cottage in Dorking, they saw the crew members drag one of the injured out of the plane after it landed. This person was a machine gunner. They helped him drag out one dead person. The other two were not seriously injured and were sent to a nearby farm, where they were placed on mats by the fire to warm up while waiting for the ambulance to arrive. One of them could speak a little English and asked for a cigarette to smoke. Before leaving, he tightly grasped the farmer's hand to thank him and his wife for their kindness. (Reuters, 3rd)

### Germany Defends Air Attacks on Merchant Ships: British Auxiliary Vessels Providing Escort Should Bear Responsibility

Berlin: Regarding the accusations that the German Air Force bombed undefended British ships, which have been repeatedly reported by British broadcasts and also mentioned in British Prime Minister Chamberlain's recent speech, the German authorities issued a statement yesterday in response, pointing out that these ships had already been turned into auxiliary warships. During the last World War, Britain used various small boats as escorts, outposts, or minesweepers, making these small boats as dangerous as other warships. According to an official report released by the British government in November 1917, a total of 1,189 fishing boats were converted into auxiliary vessels, of which 304 were equipped with 7.6-inch guns, 800 were equipped with 5.7-inch guns, and 70 were equipped with 4.7-inch guns. An even larger number of small boats have been mobilized since the outbreak of this war. How can they be called "undefended ships"? Therefore, the British Admiralty should bear the responsibility for being bombed. (Haitong, 2nd)

### German Submarines Rampant: Two Ships Sunk

London: German radio announced last night that two more ships had been sunk. It is reported that the British ship "Oregon" (6,000 tons) was sunk by a torpedo 140 miles off Corunna, Spain. The Swedish ship "Fram" (2,000 tons) exploded and sank off the English coast. Nineteen crew members of the "Fram" are missing. The fate of the crew members of the "Oregon" was not mentioned. (Reuters, 3rd)

Amsterdam: According to news from London last night, the Danish ship "Fitty" (955 tons) has been sunk by a plane. All crew members boarded lifeboats and were rescued by nearby ships. (Reuters, 3rd)

### British-Romanian Negotiations Continue: Britain Has Not Received a Satisfactory Response Regarding the Issue of Romanian Oil Exports to Germany

Amsterdam: A diplomatic correspondent for the London Times reported today that Britain and Romania are negotiating to determine Romania's attitude towards the following two issues: (1) Romania has promised to supply Germany with a large amount of gasoline, which is more than the amount of gasoline Romania supplied to Germany in the spring of 1939, when Britain guaranteed Romania's territorial integrity. (2) Whether Romania can increase the amount of gasoline supplied to Germany without hindering or intercepting the oil reserves controlled by Britain and France. Because these two questions have not received a satisfactory answer, negotiations are still ongoing. (Haitong News Agency, 3rd)

### British Air Force's Reconnaissance Achievements in German Territory: Numerous Photos Taken, German Rear Area Clearly Understood

London: After the Air Ministry released the photos taken by the British Air Force during its large-scale flights in German territory last night, responsible officials here generally believed that the situation behind the German military lines is now clear. It will be difficult for the German side to prepare any surprising military actions, because these photos allow the British side to know the situation behind the German army in more detail than any intelligence. The British Air Force's skill and organization in obtaining these photos is also evident. All important German military targets have been reconnoitered and photographed by British planes from the air. Even today, British planes are constantly conducting reconnaissance. Therefore, the Allied military command can know at any time what changes have taken place in German military ports and airfields, what new ships and new defense projects Germany has built, and the traffic conditions of German roads and canals. British planes often fly along the Siegfried Line, sometimes only a few hundred feet away from German fortresses. The films they took not only show all the German defense projects, but also the locations of military camps, stations, arsenals, and factories. In the future, when dealing with important enemy general offensives, these photos will be very valuable in practice, so that bombs will not be dropped on empty targets. (Reuters, 3rd)

### Romanian Oil Exports Statistics: Germany Ranks First

Rome: In 1939, Romania exported 4,177,571 tons of oil, worth 1.10254 billion lei (Romanian currency). In 1938, it was 4,494,792 tons, worth 1.1003014 billion lei. In 1939, oil exports to Germany (including Czechoslovakia) accounted for 30.8% of the total, compared to 22.2% in 1938. In 1939, oil exports to Britain accounted for 15.2% of the total, compared to 12.8% in 1938. In 1939, France accounted for 8.6% of the total, compared to 6.4% in 1938. (Haitong, 3rd)

### Soviet Newspaper Publishes Article Criticizing Wells

Moscow: The well-known historian H.G. Wells requested the Allies to bomb Berlin. The Communist Youth League's newspaper "Truth" recently published a commentary saying, "Wells requested the Allies to bomb Berlin. He used cruel language to demand the indiscriminate bombing of women and children, but those who provoke war are also afraid of the tragic consequences of bloodshed. In addition to not taking any action on the Siegfried Line, British and French imperialists will never dare to carry out bombing behind the enemy lines, because they know that the public mood is high and will never allow them to carry out new massacres. But at this time, Wells suddenly emerged. Wells has always prided himself on being calm, but now he has lost this personality and is actually urging those who wage war to carry out new massacres! Wells said, 'Berlin must be bombed.' We believe that Wells has changed. Wells has always taken it as his responsibility to guide the world, but now he is shouting, 'Don't save the bombs!' Alas, Wells's masks as a 'scholar' and 'philosopher' have now been torn off. He has become an agent of British imperialism." (Tass, [Day missing])

### German Ex-Kaiser Advocates: Ceasefire between England, France, and Germany to Oppose the Soviet Union

New York: German Ex-Kaiser Wilhelm II recently sent a letter to his biographer Biel, requesting that Germany, England, France, and other countries cease hostilities and unite to drive communism out of the world. The letter stated that the heroic resistance of Finland has greatly diminished the arrogance of communism, which is enough to make people reflect and seek ways to peace. In short, the warring countries in Europe should immediately cease hostilities and assist Finland. Germany, England, and France should eliminate communist internationalism and culture on the front lines. (Taizhong, 3rd)

### Fierce Air Battles between Soviet and Finnish Forces: Continuing Fighting on the Mannerheim Line; British Fighters Join the Finnish Army

Moscow: According to a communiqué from the headquarters of the Leningrad Military District, on February 2, the Soviet Air Force successfully bombed enemy military targets. At the same time, in air battles, the Soviet Air Force shot down 11 enemy planes, and one Soviet plane did not return to its base. (Ta Si [date missing])

The Capital of Sweden: The Swedish Daily recently published a telegram from a correspondent on the front line in Finland, stating that the Red Army on the Karelian front launched another offensive against the Finnish Mannerheim Line yesterday, under the cover of 200 planes. The tactics used were the same as the previous day, that is, infantry riding armored snowmobiles led the way, attacking the Finnish army's position, followed by large teams of tanks. In addition, large teams of infantry dressed in Finnish military uniforms, carrying hand-held machine guns, and riding in multiple planes, parachuted behind the Finnish army, but achieved nothing. (Havas, 3rd)

The Capital of Sweden: It is learned here that some British fighters in the Finnish Air Force, piloted by Finnish pilots, have shot down dozens of Soviet bombers. It is reported that the planes recently used by the Finnish side to attack Kronstadt and other places are fighters and bombers made in South Africa. (Reuters, 3rd)

Moscow: The Communist Party's organ newspaper "Truth" recently published an editorial stating that the heroic Red Army is fighting in Finland and constantly completing its tasks to help the Finnish people gain liberation. Since we have Comrade Stalin as our wise leader, we will surely achieve victory. Comrade Stalin has the mind of a scholar, the face of a worker, and the attire of a soldier. He is loved by the Soviet people. In short, the current European war was caused by British and French imperialists and has now spread to our country's borders. (Havas, 3rd)

Helsinki: Many Finnish cities and towns were bombed yesterday. A bomb hit an air raid shelter in Bai Qiaoni Fortress, killing 12 people. Another bomb hit the Red Cross symbol of a hospital. The building was also destroyed. Fortunately, the patients had been moved earlier, so there were no casualties. Raimosalo and other small cities were also bombed in many places. Thirty-nine Soviet bombers attacked a small village. The Saldivala war zone was often attacked, causing fires in many places and killing some residents. Soviet planes flew close to Helsinki, where two air raid alerts were issued in succession. Soviet planes dropped bombs, but were repelled by Finnish fighters. It has now been confirmed that five Soviet planes were shot down yesterday, and it is also reported that three others were destroyed. According to a war correspondent, the damage caused by the air raid on Luovanimi on Thursday was the most severe ever seen. A total of 54 Soviet planes attacked. Three Finnish fighters took off to intercept them. 45 Soviet planes were driven away, and one Soviet plane was shot down. The remaining nine Soviet planes were all four-engine bombers, flying at an altitude of over 12,000 feet, dropping multiple heavy bombs. Anti-aircraft guns fired at them, destroying four houses and killing one person. The other Soviet planes that were driven away returned after a quarter of an hour and dropped 11 bombs near a hospital. After another fifteen minutes, the planes attacked again, destroying 15 houses. In total, no less than 200 bombs were dropped. (Reuters, 3rd)

### Soviet-Estonian Relations Improve: The Treaty of Tartu

Tallinn: Estonian Foreign Minister Professor Pibo delivered a broadcast speech today on the 20th anniversary of the signing of the Soviet-Estonian Treaty of Tartu, emphasizing the importance of the treaty to Estonian foreign policy, considering it the cornerstone of Estonian foreign policy and an important event in Estonian history. Since the signing of the treaty, Estonia has pursued an independent foreign policy, free from interference from its strong neighbors. The Estonian decision did not become an obstacle between Western Europe and the Soviet Union as hoped by those at the Paris Peace Conference, but was willing to work to bridge the gap. Since the signing of the Treaty of Tartu between the Soviet Union and Estonia, diplomatic relations between the two countries have been established. The Mutual Assistance Pact signed in 1939 only supplements the Treaty of Tartu and proves to the world that the relationship between a large country and a small country must be based on conditions that mutually promote peace, rather than on the subjugation of the small country.

### Ministry of Education Suppresses Book Prices

Chongqing: According to a report from the Preparatory Office of the Central Library to the Ministry of Education, the prices of books on the market continue to rise, hindering cultural progress. It is proposed to submit five measures to the ministry to suppress book prices. The ministry reviewed the proposed measures and found them to be feasible and beneficial to both booksellers and customers. It has issued an order to all provincial and municipal governments to instruct all booksellers to follow them. The original measures are summarized as follows: (1) The quality of paper does not need to be exquisite, and the binding does not need to be beautiful, but as long as the proofreading is accurate and the printing is clear, it can be used today. The paper can be changed to domestic Daolin paper or newsprint, and imported products should be completely rejected. This can not only plug loopholes, but also save costs, so the raw materials will not be expensive. (2) Printing can be done by the Central 口口 method of decentralized publication, but the paper version can be sent to be cast and printed. In this way, the cost can be saved. (3) Hong Kong's wages are higher than those in the mainland. If printing and distribution are done in the mainland, the wages can be lower. (4) For printing projects that are heavy and cannot be published except in Hong Kong and Shanghai, the Ministry of Education should request the Ministry of Communications to instruct the Railway Bureau to provide convenience when transporting books. (5) As for the current books and reference books for newspapers, which are necessary for individuals and institutions, the price increase is particularly large, which is really unbearable for ordinary readers. The books that were originally printed and stored and those that had been transported to the mainland before the War of Resistance should not be priced at the same time as ordinary new books and books newly transported to the mainland. (News report, 2nd)

### Guangzhou Under Japanese Military Control: Residents Prohibited from Moving, Military Scrip Aggressively Promoted

Guangzhou Correspondence: The Japanese troops entrenched in Guangzhou, in conjunction with the puppet organizations, have recently implemented various measures, exerting the utmost pressure. Details are as follows:

Household Registration Checks: The Japanese military headquarters in Guangzhou previously instructed the puppet Public Security Bureau to produce household registration plaques, distribute them to puppet police stations, and order citizens to register, fill them out, and hang them in prominent places within their homes for Japanese inspection at any time. Now, to prevent guerrillas from infiltrating the city, the Japanese military, starting January 19th, has dispatched troops, along with puppet police, to conduct household registration checks in groups. If any discrepancies are found between the household registration plaque and the household population, or if anything is deemed suspicious, the Japanese military will detain the individuals and return them to the military police headquarters for questioning. Simultaneously, the Japanese Military Currency Field Security Department has also dispatched security teams to inspect vacant houses previously listed by the department to see if they are occupied. Furthermore, to prevent citizens from relocating, citizens wishing to move must first apply to the department for a relocation permit. Only after the department approves will they be allowed to register with the puppet police stations and puppet self-defense corps. Otherwise, they will be arrested and punished without leniency.

Poisoning the Entire City: Since the fall of Guangzhou, only a portion of the shops in the city have been forced to resume business, while most factories have not. Coupled with the large-scale conscription by the Japanese military in the city in recent months, the city's commerce has been left gasping for breath. Meanwhile, the businesses of chickens, crows, dogs, and gambling have abnormally flourished. Consequently, opium dens and gambling houses have sprung up, truly giving the impression of "a building every five steps, a pavilion every ten," reversing the previous state of affairs. However, the Japanese military still fears that poisoning Guangzhou is insufficient, and has recently transported large quantities of heroin and Xiamen tobacco sticks (opium), among other narcotics. Therefore, the fashion of smoking red pills (heroin) is extremely popular in the city. Each club, brothel, and private opium den sells red pills, with a price of three pills per hao (a unit of currency). Some speculators even boldly write "Attached bowling alley, female staff reception," outside their doors to attract customers, so red pill sales are very brisk. Japanese military patrol teams, whenever they discover someone privately smoking red pills, not only do not punish them but instead look upon them and smile. It is heard that each red pill den is protected by powerful figures for sales. The Japanese military's policy of poisoning is thorough.

Forcibly Using Military Scrip: The Japanese military's offensives in Guangxi have suffered successive defeats, and in northern Guangdong, they have been repeatedly defeated at Yinzhan'ao and Pajiang, resulting in significant losses. Consequently, the market price of military scrip has been steadily declining. To promote the circulation of military scrip, the Japanese military has issued notices strictly prohibiting discounts. It also stipulates that one yuan of military scrip is equal to two yuan of hao notes (subsidiary currency), and all transactions in the market must be calculated accordingly. It also orders all merchants to change to military scrip as the calculation base for the prices of goods. Five-yuan banknotes issued by the provincial bank must still be allowed to circulate as usual. Anyone holding five-yuan banknotes from the provincial bank for exchange should be given two yuan of military scrip and one yuan of hao notes, to demonstrate that these five-yuan banknotes are fully usable. However, although the market price of military scrip has slightly rebounded, it is only worth one yuan and one hao and five fen (a subdivision of currency) of hao notes. If one yuan of military scrip is forcibly equated to two yuan of hao notes, transactions will suffer extremely large losses. The Japanese military has also dispatched a large number of plainclothes detectives, holding military scrip to exchange for hao notes at the Qian Zhuang (money shops) of the Thirteenth Factories. If they are not given the exchange, the staff will be immediately detained. It is estimated that dozens of staff members of money exchange shops have already been detained, so many money exchange shops have closed down and ceased operations.

Compulsory Payment of Membership Fees: Since its establishment, the Guangzhou puppet organization first restored the puppet Municipal Chamber of Commerce to entice citizens to resume business and revitalize Guangzhou. Now, to exploit merchants and residents, it is forcibly forcing merchants and residents to pay business and other taxes. At the same time, the puppet Municipal Chamber of Commerce, because the trade associations of various industries have disappeared without a trace since the fall of Guangzhou, has since October 1st of last year, dispatched personnel to control the original trade associations of various industries, and fabricated names to present to the puppet organization for approval, forcibly ordering shops in various industries to pay membership fees. However, despite repeated coercion, there has been no income. Therefore, the puppet Municipal Chamber of Commerce begged the puppet Municipal Office's Public Security Director, Li Daoxuan, to issue a notice, forcing merchants to pay. Yesterday, Li issued a notice, limiting shops in various industries to pay membership fees within a short period of time. If they still fail to comply after the deadline, puppet police will be dispatched to investigate.

### The Wartime Jiangsu Provincial Government: Strictly Prohibiting Private Recruitment, Replenishing Granaries to Prepare for Famine

Northern Jiangsu Correspondence: The Jiangsu Provincial Government is very actively implementing wartime measures. Two matters are recorded as follows:

Prohibition of Unauthorized Recruitment: The Jiangsu Provincial Government, in conjunction with the Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Lu-Su War Zone, recently issued a notice stating: "Upon investigation, unauthorized recruitment violates military discipline and has been repeatedly prohibited. However, it has been reported that recently, troops in various regions are still using the excuse of replenishing vacancies to send personnel to recruit everywhere, or ordering village chiefs to forcibly draft young men, or forcing residents to supply provisions. Some vagrants and unemployed people are taking advantage of the opportunity to falsely claim to have been appointed to positions by certain troops, rallying crowds, donning military uniforms, and engaging in disturbances. Such disregard for the law must be thoroughly investigated. In addition to reiterating previous orders, this notice is issued to inform the public. Hereafter, any troops supplementing troop strength must not engage in unauthorized recruitment without submitting a request for approval and possessing official documents. Violations will be reported truthfully and punished by this government according to law. Those who, under false pretenses, impersonate military personnel and harm villagers will be strictly apprehended by the commissioners and county magistrates, as well as the garrison troops stationed in the area, to clear the area. Words will be followed by deeds, and no leniency will be granted. May our military and civilians comply."

Instructing Grain Storage: The Jiangsu Provincial Government, to replenish granaries and prepare for famine years, specially instructed the administrative inspectors of the 4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th districts, the Xuhai Administrative Office of the government, and the county magistrates of the 4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th districts of the Northern Jiangsu Food Administration to comply. The document stated: "Grain storage is an essential policy for preparing for famine. Regarding the matter of replenishing granaries, the Civil Affairs and Finance Departments issued Instructions Cai Zi No. 1268 and Zhi Zi No. 1112 in November of the year before last, prescribing seven principles for handling the matter, ordering all districts and counties to strictly comply. After October of last year, this government issued Instructions Xing Cai Zi No. 3672 and Xing Min Zi No. 1732, ordering all counties to comply, and ordered the Northern Jiangsu Food Administration to supervise the handling of each case. Now, to adapt to the environment, the Provisional Measures for Regional Grain Storage in Various Counties of Jiangsu Province During Extraordinary Times are formulated and circulated for implementation, so that they may be followed. In addition to separately ordering the Xuhai Administrative Office of this government, the Northern Jiangsu Food Administration, the administrative inspectors of the 4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th districts, and the county magistrates, a copy is enclosed with this order." Attached: Provisional Measures for Regional Grain Storage in Various Counties of Jiangsu Province During Extraordinary Times. Circulated by the Provincial Government on January 5, the 29th year of the Republic. (1) These provisional measures are formulated based on the third item of the Principles for Building Granaries and Storing Grain promulgated on November 11, the 17th year of the Republic, which states, "Collecting and storing grain by region is essential for ensuring convenience and safety." (2) Starting from the 29th year of the Republic, all counties in Northern Jiangsu shall uniformly store grain by region in accordance with the prescribed standards to prepare for famine relief. (3) Regional grain storage should be decentralized to individual bao (collective security unit), with each bao serving as a storage unit, and stored separately to ensure safety. (4) Regional grain storage should, as far as possible, utilize public ancestral halls and temples, entrusting the abbots, monks, or responsible persons to manage it. (5) If any bao lacks suitable ancestral halls or temples, or reliable custodians, the township head of the jurisdiction should designate a wealthy person from the local area, and report to the county government for approval to be responsible for custody. (6) Custodians of each bao's grain storage should issue a written guarantee to store and care for the grain carefully. (7) Regional grain storage, except for bao near enemy-controlled areas, should be universally carried out by the township heads of the jurisdiction. (8) If there is a risk of any bao's grain storage being used by the enemy, the township head of the jurisdiction should order the grain to be moved to a safe place to prevent it from being used by the enemy. If, due to failure to exert all efforts, the grain storage is lost, the township head should be responsible for compensation. (9) The starting and ending dates for grain storage, fundraising methods, and management methods should be carefully drafted by each county based on local conditions and reported to the provincial departments for approval and implementation. (10) These provisional measures shall be circulated for implementation by the provincial government. If there are any matters not covered, they may be amended by order at any time.

### Japanese Troops in Xiashi Forcibly Conscripting Laborers to Build Trenches; Hundreds Arrested

Xiashi Correspondence: The local Japanese troops have recently ordered the forced conscription of laborers in the area near the Dongshan foothill railway station, forcing them to dig trenches and other defensive works. Since the 25th, hundreds of people have been arrested. Upon hearing the news, the villagers are panicking and residing indoors, causing the streets to be deserted. Although the Lunar New Year is approaching, the shops are empty and business has effectively come to a standstill, presenting a tense situation.

### Another Attack on Puppet Officials Occurs in Suzhou; Ma Guorong Barely Escapes

Suzhou Correspondence: On January 29th, at around 6 PM on Jingde Road in Suzhou city, in front of the Hygiene Bureau, a person wearing a thick woolen overcoat was walking along Jingde Road, followed by six young men in short clothes. They followed him to Huanglifang Bridge, where one of the six men drew a handgun and shot the person in the overcoat twice. The other five men also drew box cannons and hand grenades in succession, creating great chaos. It is said that the person in the overcoat managed to escape, and the six men fired a shot into the air as a warning, dropped a piece of paper on the ground, and then left calmly. When the Japanese troops arrived after hearing the news, they immediately implemented special martial law, causing a commotion for three hours. As a result, they gained nothing. It is heard that the main person who escaped was Ma Guorong, a major regimental adjutant of the 813 Suzhou Military Hospital, who currently holds an important position in the puppet organization, and therefore was attacked.

### Dinghai County Government Intensifies Political Work, Plans to Establish District Offices in the Shortest Possible Time

Sexology

### Sexual Energy and Mental Energy After Depletion

— Yang Daonan, MD, Graduate of the Russian Labor University Medical School

The Most Advanced Replenishment Therapy … Masturbation and Indulgence are Deadly Wounds to Sexual Energy and Mental Energy

Mental energy and sexual energy are essentially one, because with mental energy, sexual desire will not be lost. If indulgence is excessive, its mental energy will inevitably weaken. According to daily experience, the depletion of mental energy and sexual energy in the human body has two major causes: one is masturbation and debauchery, and the other is overly complex work. The former is a bad habit that self-neglecting youths often fall into, and the latter is unavoidable for hardworking youths. We live on this isolated island with the highest cost of living, feeling the pressure of life and the panic of the economy, and we have to work hard to solve our livelihood problems. Because the mind is too tired, the nerves gradually weaken, resulting in sexual dysfunction, which is very common.

After neurasthenia, nocturnal emission is inevitable. Frequent and prolonged nocturnal emission gradually expands the scope of weakness to sexual function, leading to premature ejaculation and kidney deficiency. The joy of youth is lost!

The function of sexual function cannot be neglected or indulged. Although neglect and indulgence both have drawbacks, the harm of indulgence is undoubtedly greater. Therefore, after indulgence, the youth glands are greatly weakened, and love is difficult to generate during bed pleasure. For the sake of happiness, it is best to treat it early. The most effective medicine for this type of disease is the German "Vitalkraft," a genuine animal testicular essence preparation for men. After a very short period, it can invigorate mental energy, enhance sexual performance, and promote metabolic function. All symptoms such as insomnia, forgetfulness, lower back pain, loss of appetite, premature ejaculation, nocturnal emission, impotence, and infertility are quickly cured. Those who usually feel neurasthenia will become energetic. Those who have weak marital love will also reconcile as before. This is why "Vitalkraft" is highly respected by both medical and pharmaceutical circles. The female "Vitalkraft" promotes breast development and regulates menstruation, with miraculous effects.

Venereal Disease Spring and Autumn

### Candidates for Husband's Gonorrhea

— Huang Zhongchang, MD, USA

Those who approach him are in danger of contracting leucorrhea.

Timely treatment should reduce the chance of spreading to relatives.

When a person suffers from gonorrhea, it is not just personal suffering. This kind of pain can also be shared with close relatives. One's wife is the best candidate for a gonorrhea patient. This is unavoidable. Knowing that a husband has gonorrhea, he should be treated quickly without delay. Unfortunately, many gonorrhea patients are not treated properly, so it changes from acute to chronic, and from chronic to various dangerous complications. Therefore, the patient not only suffers temporarily, but also leaves harm for life. This aside, consider the wife already infected with gonococcal disease.

Generally, once women are infected with gonococcal disease, their genitals will feel inflamed and painful. Vaginal discharge suddenly increases and the lower abdomen is full. Urination is painful. During menstruation, there is always pus and blood mixed in the menstrual blood. Some people are unaware that they are already infected with gonococcal disease. If left untreated at this time, gonococci will inevitably invade the uterus and ovaries, destroying their reproductive function. Also, if the gonococci are in the vaginal area, and the baby is unfortunately infected during delivery, there is a risk of blindness. Therefore, if a person suffers from gonorrhea, in addition to his wife being a candidate for gonorrhea, innocent children will also be harmed by this poison. Therefore, both men and women should be treated at the same time to avoid harming the future. According to my years of practical experience, women's gonococcal leukorrhea, in addition to taking "Clinon," also use "Karolschweddi Vaginal Tablets" as suppositories in the vaginal tract. Insert one piece every night before going to bed and wash it off in the morning. This tablet is a collection of vaginal bacteria and various compounds that kill gonococci. At the same time, the method is simple, so it is quite suitable for women to treat gonococcal leukorrhea at home on their own. I have been in clinical practice for more than 20 years, and I have always introduced this kind of treatment for women's gonococcal leukorrhea. I have gathered treatment experience statistics from all over the world, proving that this treatment is superior to any other treatment method.

### The Severity of Coughing

— Physician Sheng Zaiqiang

Coughing is easily overlooked, because cough patients do not show any dangerous phenomena, so it is delayed, and the coughing becomes more and more severe, leading to irrecoverable consequences.

From a true pathological point of view, coughing is the lung's way of expelling foreign invaders, which is a sign of resistance. If coughing is suppressed, the resistance will be reduced. According to my 20 years of experience and the experimental records of physicians from various countries, "Pulmonal" is the most effective drug for lung diseases invented by German Dr. Tume. No matter how stubborn the cough is, even if it is about to become consumption, taking "Pulmonal" can relieve coughing and dissolve phlegm within three hours. It is better than cod liver oil in terms of supplementing the lungs and preventing consumption. This has been proven by physicians from various countries.

### Nocturnal Emission Should Be Treated Early

— Zheng Jian, MD, Germany

If parents are physically weak and congenitally deficient, just like plants that do not have good seeds, they cannot grow strong and lush. Those who are congenitally deficient are often nervous, pale, thin, and sickly. Often in childhood, they often suffer from bedwetting, and after development, it turns into nocturnal emission. Bedwetting and nocturnal emission are one type of urinary disease and one type of genital disease. Although the paths are different, the local nerves are not tolerant of irritation.

If we allow nocturnal emission to continue without stopping it, it is like storing water in a broken urn, which will eventually run out and dry up. Life is as dangerous as crushing eggs, so early treatment is an urgent matter. According to my experience, the most effective medicine to stop nocturnal emission is the German "Nels Nocturnal Emission Tablets." After taking it, it can consolidate the sperm gates, calm the brain, clear the mind, and reduce lascivious dreams, with excellent effects. If taken with "Vitalkraft," it can replenish losses and the effect will be greater.

### Gonorrhea Experimental Case

— Physician Yao Juyan

Clinic: No. 9 Ningbo Road, Intersection of Sichuan Road

Multiple Gonococcal Arthritis

"Case Summary" Patient Zhou Minwen, a Chinese manager of a certain foreign company, likes to horseback ride. He has had gonorrhea for a long time and it has recurred repeatedly. He has been delaying treatment for three years. The joints gradually feel swollen and painful, but there is no fixed pattern. Often, this joint moves to another joint, so all four limbs and joints are difficult to bend. He has taken various internal medicines and tried electrical therapy, but they have been ineffective. With a little movement, the joints and tendons become tight and painful. In fact, he has become a cripple. Later, he was introduced to my clinic by his colleague He Qin Ke. After a detailed diagnosis, I diagnosed him with typical arthritis. I used anti-gonococcal serum and X-ray diathermy and static electricity therapy. At the same time, I used the gonococcal medicine "Clinon" internally. After two weeks, the condition was very good. The inflammation and swelling gradually disappeared, and the movement gradually became more flexible. After about three weeks, all the gonococci were completely eradicated, and everything returned to a healthy state.

"Treatment Analysis" According to Zhou Jun's disease, it is called multiple syphilis arthritis. The reason why this disease is formed is due to the patient's love of movement and lack of treatment. Gonococci often flow through the joints from the blood due to the stimulation of labor and attach to the joints, causing inflammation, redness, and swelling. General short-wave electrical therapy only has a very small effect on local inflammation. Other internal medicines only have a slight effect on the mucous membrane of the reproductive organs. They cannot have any bactericidal effect on the whole body joints. The anti-gonococcal serum I use can decompose the adhesive joint inflammation and further use static electricity therapy to increase its bactericidal effect, and "Clinon" is also a famous anti-gonococcal phagocyte. After the gonococci have been eradicated and the inflammation has subsided, the swelling, pain, and other symptoms will naturally disappear. With such a broad bactericidal effect, it can achieve a thorough cure in a very short period of three weeks. Clinic hours are from 10 am to 6 pm. Starting from today, 20 patients will be seen every day and a registration fee of 5 jiao will be charged.

### After Inspecting the Yangtze River, the American Ambassador Returns to Shanghai Today; Scheduled to Go to Hong Kong on the 8th and Chongqing This Month; Will Stop Briefly in Guangzhou En Route

American Ambassador Johnson, left Shanghai on the 22nd of last month, went to Hankou, and inspected the situation of American expatriates in Nanjing, Wuhu, and other places along the way. He arrived in Hankou on the 29th of last month. It is now learned that the ambassador has completed his business in Hankou and has taken the flagship Luzon back to Shanghai, arriving in port this afternoon.

Close Study of the Current Situation of the Yangtze River: The English-language Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury said that American Ambassador Johnson's trip to Hankou along the Yangtze River, lasting thirteen days, will return to Shanghai on the American warship Luzon tomorrow (the evening of the 4th). It is known that the ambassador departed from Shanghai with his staff on January 22. When he was about to depart, he said that this trip had "no special significance." However, the public believes that since the ambassador has stayed briefly in Nanjing and Wuhu and other important points, he must have studied the current situation in the Yangtze River area more closely.

Going to Chongqing and Guangzhou Next Week: After returning to Shanghai, the ambassador will take the Java Company's ship Chizalianka to Hong Kong at noon on Thursday (the 8th), and will arrive in Chongqing this month. American Attache Haimeke will accompany the ambassador to Chongqing, and is scheduled to stop briefly in Guangzhou en route. The American warship Guam was originally stationed in Hankou, but was recently replaced by the American warship Worth Lake, which is following the Luzon and will arrive in Shanghai tomorrow evening.

### The Salvation Army Allocates Large Sums for Relief; Many Chinese Have Donated in Recent Days

The 1940 Salvation Army Fundraising Movement, led by Brigadier Morley, has recently been declared by Morley to be most commendable for its achievements, with Chinese donating a total of 10,000 gold. Yesterday, a Chinese person personally sent 400 yuan to the Sassoon headquarters. Before leaving, he told people that foreigners in Shanghai are very admirable for their willingness to contribute to the work of the Salvation Army, because the number of unfortunate foreigners who have benefited from the Salvation Army is far fewer than the number of Chinese. The Zhejiang Industrial Bank sent 3,000 cotton-padded coats to the army to save Chinese and women and children. Another Chinese donated 50 cotton-padded coats. It is heard that the army plans to use 150,000 yuan for relief this year. If people from all walks of life have donations, they can be sent to the army's headquarters at No. 40 Sassoon Building.

### Head of International Business Team Returns Home to Join the War; British Royal Society Hosts Farewell Banquet

Majors Corbin and Graham, the heads of the International Business Team, will return to England to join the war and will leave in the coming days. The British Royal Aeronautical Society, because Majors Kagel are both members of the society and will return home to devote themselves to the battlefield, hosted a banquet at noon on the 3rd to bid farewell to the two men. Mr. Hult, chairman of the Aeronautical Society, gave a speech, in which he hoped that the two men's decision to return home would be promoted to high positions and return in triumph. Corbin replied that he would be able to meet the expectations of the people and deal with the enemy, and expressed his gratitude to the association for the farewell banquet. According to Major Graham, "I am very happy to go this time. What makes me even more gratified is that I will be able to meet and greet old comrades on the front line and take on the responsibility of defending the motherland. I will follow in my footsteps and charge and kill the enemy." Chairman Hollt ended by saying, "May the two Kagels seize the opportunity to get what they want."

### Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Fessenden, Goes to Dalian; To Help a Friend Solve the Problem of Shipping Horses from Dalian to Shanghai; Obtains Japanese Permission to Go to Dalian for Negotiation

The English-language Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury said that the Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, namely Mr. Fessenden, a famous American lawyer in the city, temporarily abandoned his public duties at 8 am this morning (the 3rd) and took the Japanese ship Dalian Maru to Dalian. This trip will take eight to ten days. The sudden departure was because a friend of his wanted to ship a large number of horses from northeastern China to Shanghai, but encountered difficulties in Dalian. Last week, he telegraphed Fessenden for assistance, and then telegraphed again, saying that if Fessenden could assist, he would be given the best horse. Fessenden consulted the Japanese consulate early this week and obtained permission to go to Dalian and stay for a few days, and set off this morning. It is generally believed that Fessenden will not return to Shanghai before the next meeting of the Shanghai Municipal Council to be held on Wednesday of next week, and that the meeting will be temporarily chaired by Vice-Chairman Kesswick. At the same time, Mr. Ge Bo, Deputy Secretary-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council, will also attend the next meeting, because Secretary-General Fei Xiangpu has gone on a three-week vacation in Singapore and may not return to Shanghai within the next week.

### Troop慰問 Campaign, Enthusiastic Atmosphere, Reaching 50,000 Yuan in Three Days, Morale Boosted, Victory Within Reach

Since the National慰問General Association initiated the Spring Gift 慰問 Campaign, there has been a unanimous and enthusiastic response from all regions. In Shanghai, various groups have also collectively discussed and promoted the campaign, starting work on the first day of the month. Since the beginning of the fundraising, citizens have been motivated by patriotic enthusiasm, and donations have been extremely active. The results in recent days have been quite good. Due to the ongoing collection of funds, it is impossible to count the exact amount, but it is estimated to have reached over 50,000 yuan. Furthermore, the situation of various sectors automatically submitting 慰問 donations has been very crowded in recent days. It is also known that a large-scale promotion will be held on February 7th, so it is hoped that all sectors will save on miscellaneous expenses and donate to 慰問 purposes, in order to encourage the morale of the front lines and strive for final victory.

### Charity Organizations Advocate, Citywide Spring Festival Relief, New Year Gifts to Aid Disaster Relief, All Sectors Step Forward Righteously, Le Shan Society to Distribute Rice on New Year's Eve, Stranded Compatriots on the Streets Eagerly Awaiting Relief

The Thrift and Disaster Relief Committee issued a sincere public announcement yesterday, appealing to people from all walks of life to reduce their New Year's Eve dinner expenses to help disaster victims, stating that a New Year's Eve gathering only needs to be simple and complete in order to connect friendships and express celebrations. It would be unbearable to pursue excessive extravagance at a time when the streets are full of people freezing and starving. Therefore, the committee appealed to all shops, companies, families, and individuals to donate two or three tenths or more of the money they would spend on the New Year's Eve dinner. Please indicate "New Year's Eve Dinner Donation" and send it to major banks in the city for collection. The committee is extremely grateful.

New Year Gifts to Aid Disaster Relief Since various charities called for saving on New Year's gifts and New Year's Eve dinner expenses to help compatriots in distress, all sectors have been moved with compassion and have actively participated. The Citizen Group of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association received the following donations yesterday: Xiuyang Hall, 50 yuan; Defeng Yarn Factory, 120 yuan; Cai Xuanji, 50 yuan; Wei Mansion, 30 yuan; Zhang Hengyuan Store, 20 yuan. The New Year's Eve Disaster Relief Society has also received donations of New Year's Eve dinner expenses: Chen Gongbao, 100 yuan; Maofeng Company colleagues, 37 yuan; Liu Zhiqiang, Wang Changshun, Chen Guoyu, and Xiao Dongbin, a total of 8 yuan.

Rice Distribution on New Year's Eve The Le Shan Society in Shanghai has been known for its good deeds over the years, such as providing clothing, distributing rice, and offering free medical services. Since the beginning of winter, the society has distributed over ten thousand yuan worth of clothing and rice. The society has recently decided to distribute rice all night on the eve of the lunar New Year, and also give each person an extra pound of bread. It is said that the funds for this project come from the daily consultation fees of Shou Qi, an volunteer doctor of the society, and the funeral allowance of the deceased father of Mr. Jin, an executive member of the society.

Seeking Clothing and Bedding Datong News Agency reports that the Shanghai Charity Organizations Joint Disaster Relief Association and the War Zone Refugee Relief Committee are seeking clothing and bedding for the Second Refugee Shelter. The association is preparing to establish the Second Refugee Shelter before February 7 (i.e., lunar New Year's Eve) to accommodate poor people without clothing and food. However, there is an urgent need for cotton quilts, and the number is very large. Not only is funding difficult, but preparation is also insufficient. Therefore, a notice is published to solicit donations from all sectors. New or old, large or small, are all welcome to benefit the poor. The merit is immeasurable.

Refugees on the Streets The Shanghai First Special District Citizen United Association sent a letter to the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association yesterday, saying, "Dear Sirs, according to newspaper reports, 41 large bodies and 146 small bodies of poor people who froze to death on the streets were collected by the Pushan Villa on the 28th and 29th of last month, totaling 187 bodies, which is shocking. It has been found that the situation of poor people sleeping on the streets in the alleys this year is more serious than in previous years due to the high prices and the closure of various shelters. Although some charitable organizations are providing porridge and rice, or sending steamed buns, the resources are limited and are like a drop in the bucket. We believe that your association is the leading charitable organization in Shanghai. If you could allocate funds at this time to provide urgent relief to poor people sleeping on the streets, the merit would be immense, and it would also benefit public security. Although the purpose of your association's organization is to relieve refugees, the current plight of poor people sleeping on the streets in the alleys is actually worse than that of refugees in shelters. We hope that you will understand the intention of helping people and send a special letter to suggest that you quickly allocate funds to provide urgent relief to poor people sleeping on the streets in the alleys in order to expand relief. We pray for this sincerely."

### Southern Sales of National Products Still Require Effort, Wang Gongquan Returns to Shanghai and Talks About the Extremely Strict Restrictions in Southeast Asia

Since Shanghai became an isolated island, the industrial and commercial sectors have paid much attention to the consumption situation in the Southeast Asian islands. Recently, Wang Gongquan, the manager of Tianxiang Yibao Factory, returned to Shanghai after an inspection of the Southeast Asian islands. According to him, the restrictions on the import of Shanghai national products in Southeast Asia are quite strict, and they are classified and banned from import. Therefore, economic control is very thorough. As a result, if national products want to develop in Southeast Asia, they still need to work together to make an effort to succeed.

### Tang Jiusheng's Entire Family Killed

The English "North China Daily News" reported that news came out of the western suburbs of Shanghai today (the 3rd) that Tang Jiusheng was planning to go to northern Jiangsu a week ago. On the eve of his departure, his confidant

Gao hosted a banquet at Qianhang. During the banquet, Tang, his wife, and their children were all poisoned, and the whole family died. The exact address of the incident is not yet known, but it is said that someone went to Tang's residence near Yuanyuan Road, near Yidingpan Road, to visit Tang before he left, and saw

three corpses. The leftovers were still there. It was then discovered that the banquet was hosted by Wang, a confidant of Tang, and it was confirmed that poison had been placed in the meal. It was also discovered that Tang was physically strong and did not die immediately after being poisoned. He was then stabbed several times by the murderer before he finally died. It is reported that the Japanese military police are currently investigating the case, but there are still no clues.

### Railway Workers Borrowing Internal Support and Savings

The previous newspaper reported news about railway workers borrowing and issuing relief funds, saying that the funds were raised by the railway's "Trade Union." Yesterday, inquiries were made with relevant parties, and it was learned that the borrowed funds were actually the railway bureau's original employee support savings, which were bank deposits that had not been cleared and issued and had matured. Upon the request of the employees staying in Shanghai, the railway's custodian office submitted a request to the Ministry of Transportation, which approved the borrowing and issuance at its discretion. Each person with savings received 20 yuan, and each person without savings received 10 yuan, which will be deducted from their original salary in the future. There was no fundraising by the so-called "Trade Union."

### The First Phase of Price Stabilization Sales Ends Tomorrow, Planning a Lasting Solution, Appointing Other Rice Shops to Continue the Operation, Yu Qiaqing's Remarks Hope for Donation Support

The Shanghai Rice Market Management Committee has decided that the market trading will be temporarily suspended starting today (the 4th) because the accounting period for each shop is approaching and each shop is engaged in settlement. All unfinished procedures were cleared yesterday. As for the date of resuming the market, it is estimated that trading can only be resumed around February 11th, because the brokers are busy with settlement and other work during this time. As for the grain reserves in Shanghai, they have increased by tens of thousands of bags compared to last week. More than 29,000 bags of foreign rice arrived yesterday. The rise in prices is actually manipulated by speculators who see high prices. The authorities will severely punish them to maintain the people's food.

Various Industries Raise Funds for Price Stabilization The Shanghai Hardware and Parts Trade Association previously formed a fundraising committee to raise price stabilization funds for the Price Stabilization Committee. It was decided to donate 600 yuan per month from January onwards for a period of six months. Since the Travel Industry Association has been fundraising, members have enthusiastically contributed, and the total amount has exceeded several thousand yuan. The association has now decided to hold a meeting in the coming days to discuss specific measures to assist in price stabilization in order to benefit the small people.

### End of the First Phase of Price Stabilization Sales

The Shanghai Price Stabilization Committee entrusted 100 rice shops that are members of the Rice Shop Association to carry out price stabilization sales in the two concessions. Since the start of the operation, it has been 13 days. It is now heard that the first phase of price stabilization will be temporarily ended on February 5 (i.e., the 28th day of the twelfth lunar month), and will continue to be held after the general accounting of each industry. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency especially visited Mr. Yu Qiaqing, the chairman of the association, yesterday.

Published remarks, roughly saying that this price stabilization is being held during an extraordinary period, when rice prices have risen continuously and uncontrollably. The high price of rice cannot be afforded by ordinary people. In order to help the people's food and stabilize people's lives, this association has specially raised donations from various industries to purchase Saigon broken rice and sell it at a discount. It has been 13 days since the start of the operation. The members of the Rice Shop Industry Association have enthusiastically supported it, sacrificed their own business and continued to carry out the price stabilization. They are commendable for being courageous in doing good, and also donating money. They have contributed both money and effort, which is truly commendable. The association represents the people

Deeply grateful. As for the order, it is more orderly this time than the last time, and the situation of pushing and competing has decreased compared to before. Thanks to the authorities of the two concessions for sending police to suppress and protect Zhou Zhi. This should be thanked to the authorities of the two concessions. The first phase of price stabilization was originally planned to be held until the end of the lunar New Year to end it, and then continue to be held in the coming spring. It is now the end of the year, and both large and small families must pre-purchase food for the end of the year. However, during this general closing period, the rice shops that are holding price stabilization must also handle their own business closing matters. If the price stabilization is not temporarily suspended, various difficulties will inevitably occur in fact. Therefore, in accordance with the request of the Rice Shop Industry Association, it was decided that each price stabilization point will sell until February 5

Temporarily stop the sale of rice in order to handle the closing of each rice shop's business and spend the old lunar new year. Other rice shops will be designated to continue the operation. Currently, each industry is enthusiastically recognizing and raising price stabilization donations, and the amount has received more than 50,000 yuan. Such a large amount of donations has been collected in a small number of days, which shows that each industry is courageous and righteous. The association has purchased several batches of broken rice and shipped them to the godowns for successive price stabilization. The rice that has been determined but not yet arrived will also come one after another. However, due to the rising price of rice, the losses are very large. Without a huge amount of donations, I am afraid that it will be difficult to sustain. I sincerely hope that the leaders of each industry who have not recognized the donation will be compassionate and relieve hunger,

Speed up the fundraising and happily help so that the price stabilization charity will not be interrupted. Not only will the poor receive practical benefits, but it will also be beneficial to local public security.

The Japanese Army Avoids Talking About Operating the Rice Business The Zilin Newspaper said that at a reception for newly opened reporters held by the Japanese side yesterday (the 2nd), when asked what actions the Japanese army is taking to solve the Shanghai rice shortage, as promised a few weeks ago, the Japanese military spokesman replied that the army does not operate the wholesale rice business, so it cannot supply rice to the Public Concession and the French Concession. The army's duty is to fight, but it has kept its promise and supplied rice to the occupied areas such as Hongkou and Zhabei. The English "North China Daily News" also said that merchants in Shanghai ridiculed the words of the Japanese military spokesman. It is said that the Japanese army not only operates the rice business, but also the egg business. If the Japanese army says it does not operate the rice business, then why does it hinder the free transportation of rice? The reason why rice prices are so high is all because of the Japanese army.

### China's Grand Army Encircles Xixing, The Japanese Situation Becomes More Difficult, The Highways in Coastal Counties Have Been Destroyed, Counties Ordered to Evacuate People and Goods

The Japanese troops south of the Qiantang River, after being intercepted by the Chinese army, are now confined to Xiaoshan County and the Xixing coast, surrounded by the Chinese army. It will not be difficult to destroy them in one fell swoop. The Datong News Agency reporter now records the situation as follows.

Japanese Troops Crossing the River Exhausted

The Japanese troops who crossed the Qiantang River and fled to the south bank, after being intercepted by the Chinese army, fled back to the Xixing Jianggan area, where the situation is difficult. The Japanese troops occupying Xiaoshan County are extremely panicked because they have been repeatedly attacked by the Chinese army, resulting in fierce street fighting. There is a look of retreat and gathering in Xixing Jianggan. East of Keqiao, order has been completely restored in Shaoxing, Yuyao, and Shangyu counties. People's hearts are calm.

Ningbo's Market Situation Suddenly Becomes Sluggish

Also according to Ningbo visitors, since the war on the south bank of the Qiantang River, Ningbo's people have been somewhat nervous, but the market is calm and order is as usual. In order to evacuate materials and preserve national financial resources, the authorities have ordered all industries to prepare to move goods to safe areas in case of emergency. The provincial government has also ordered the Ningbo Shipping Administration to follow the precedent for imported goods, except for Japanese goods and embargoed items, and to register and release them to each customs broker nearby. It has also notified each cargo owner to quickly remove the goods stored in the customs warehouses and to stop receiving passenger goods.

Japanese Commander Suddenly Goes to Dinghai

In Dinghai waters, Japanese warships have been frequently travelling back and forth recently, but there have been no unusual movements. Also, according to people arriving in Shanghai from Dinghai, Chinese mobile units are very active in the four suburbs of the county. The Shanghai Japanese naval commander, Kyokko Ichiro, suddenly arrived in Dinghai by ship from Shanghai on the 27th of last month. In the afternoon, he disembarked and transferred to a three-wheeled motorized bicycle to go to the "Zhoushan Base Command" under Nandou to Suoshan to rest. Later, he summoned Kita Moshio and others to instruct them on the means of defending to the death. When he entered the city, martial law was imposed throughout the city. Japanese soldiers with armed posts were densely distributed in the Dahua Wharf, Guanyin Bridge, South City Gate, and Xiaoxiaochang area, and have not yet relaxed.

Hunan and Jiangxi Merchants Stop Purchasing Ningbo Goods

Hunan and Jiangxi merchants have stopped purchasing goods for fear that traffic on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway will be blocked, resulting in sluggish sales. If the invading Japanese troops in Xiaoshan are not repelled, the Ningbo market will inevitably become increasingly depressed. As for the highway between Jinhua and Xikou, it still maintains the passage of passenger and cargo vehicles, and there is no obstruction. The rumor that the road has been temporarily suspended is a misreport.

Coastal Highways Have Been Destroyed

In order to meet wartime needs, the Zhejiang provincial government has successively destroyed many Zhejiang East highways. Since the recent Xiaoshan war, in order to prevent the Japanese army from using the highway, the government has destroyed the important traffic lines again. According to reliable information, the Zhejiang provincial authorities are most focused on destroying the highways in coastal counties, such as Shaoxing, Yuyao, Cixi, Ningbo, Wenzhou, and other places. The important roads have been dismantled, leaving only a few small sections in the middle.

Short Roads in Various Counties Have Been Dismantled Separately

Since the recent Zhejiang East war, the short-distance highways that were left have also been almost completely destroyed. Currently, there is no highway to travel from Ningbo to neighboring counties. The highway from Lishui to coastal counties, such as the Haikou Wenxi line, has also been dismantled separately recently.

Songmen Shipping Line Suddenly Becomes an Important Route

Since the situation in Zhejiang East changed, the Shanghai-Zhejiang voyage has become in demand. Currently, the Shanghai-Ningbo and Shanghai-Wenzhou lines are becoming increasingly frequent in passenger and cargo transportation. It is reported that Songmen in Zhejiang East is very close to Haimen. Since Jiaojiang was blockaded, the German Far East Company's Hana Wheel once sailed to the Shanghai Songmen pier to carry people and goods from Haimen. Recently, various foreign shipping companies, seeing the need for navigation in Zhejiang East, have joined the route one after another. There have been four ships before and after, all of which are British Maher Wheels. The German Haiyi Wheel, which used to run on the North Sha Line, has now also changed to Songmen. Many passengers travel from that line to Zhejiang East, which will become the second route to Haimen.

Baiguan Songxia Drafts Temporarily Suspended

The Shanghai Postal Administration received a telegram yesterday from the Lishui Postal Administration of Zhejiang, stating that drafts from Zhuji, Shaoxing, and Xiaoshan will remain suspended, and drafts from Baiguan and Songxia will also be suspended from today. The Shanghai Post Office has suspended the exchange of drafts from the above two locations.

### Taikoo and Jardine Matheson Revising, North and South Seas Freight Rates, Coal Prices Soar, Shipping Industry Greatly Affected, But Foreign Vessels Profit from Repeated Increase in Water Fees

Foreign merchants in China have always been led by British merchants, followed by Japanese, American, French, German, and Italian merchants. Since the August 13th Anti-Japanese War, the Yangtze River has been completely occupied by Japanese merchants. Other foreign ships have suspended sailing to this day, and their losses have been heavy. Although the Japanese side has recently announced the opening of navigation on the Shanghai-Nanjing section of the Yangtze River, there is no definite date yet. As for the Japanese side, in addition to monopolizing the Yangtze River, they also hope to dominate the coastal shipping industry. They have merged more than a dozen shipping companies such as Nissin, Nippon Yusen Kaisha, and Osaka Shosen Kaisha to form a large-scale shipping organization called the "East Asia Shipping Co., Ltd.," which is intended to be the general hub for seizing the coastal shipping industry. It has been established for three months, but its attempt has not been successful due to a lack of ships.

Foreign Merchant Vessels

Shipping is still unusually prosperous. Although there is sometimes covert obstruction in North China, the actual impact is still minimal. Therefore, the statistics of each foreign merchant last year have made considerable profits. As for the Central European route, there was once a risk of suspension when the European war began, but it remained unchanged because the Far East strictly maintained neutrality. It then resumed sailing. Only the sailing schedule is secret, and the prosperity of its cargo transportation is no less than before August 13th. The benefits can be imagined. The China-America route (after the China-Japan military conflict, the American mail ship President Hoover suffered a stray bullet from an aircraft outside the Wusong Estuary, and later ran aground on the Taiwan waters, so the China-America route was suspended. In early November of the previous year, the Da Lai Company was reorganized into the American President Lines, and then resumed shipping. Now, due to

European War Relations

A part of the goods shipped to Europe are shipped to the United States and transferred to Europe, so the China-America shipping has also developed significantly. The freight rates of each shipping line have increased several times since August 13th, that is, the freight rates of the Chinese coastal shipping lines, in addition to the increase, are also changed from national currency to Hong Kong dollars. It is learned that the British Taikoo and Jardine Matheson companies have recently seen soaring coal prices and have agreed to revise the freight rates for the North and South Seas. The freight rate for Chinese merchants' goods is still calculated at HK$18.56 per ton, but the 0.975 commission for customs brokers has been cancelled, and there is also a saying that the 0.95 commission has also been cancelled. Foreign firms have always been given preferential treatment for declared and packed goods, and each item only costs HK$15.47. When the 0.975 commission for Chinese customs brokers is cancelled, it will also be increased by 20% at the same time, and the total freight rate is also HK$18.56.

This Month the 9th

It will be implemented from this month. It has been notified to each innkeeper yesterday. It is heard that after the implementation of the above measures, the freight rate for Chinese merchants will probably be revised again soon.

### US Navy, Music Service This Morning

The US 4th Marine Regiment held a music service at the Grand Theater this morning. First, the Marine Corps Band played marches and preludes. After Reverend McGann preached, Ms. Zhou, a talented student of Zhao Meibo, a famous music teacher in Shanghai, sang Chinese and Western songs, and three other talented students sang Beethoven's famous songs together. The piano was accompanied by Mr. Barr, a famous pianist and composer in Shanghai. All sectors were welcome to participate.

### 1939 Shanghai Worker Living Conditions

Cost of Living and Retail Prices

Reasons for the High Cost of Living: This year's cost of living has continued to rise. The main reasons are nothing more than the following: (1) Sharp Decline in Foreign Exchange: Starting from June 9th of this year, the exchange rate of the British pound dropped from eight pence to six and a half pence. After July 18th, it further dropped to below three and a half pence. The repeated sharp decline in foreign exchange, although stabilizing slightly later, caused prices to rise accordingly. (2) Speculation and Manipulation: There are many speculators, and the trend of hoarding and manipulation is rampant, initially in the foreign exchange and gold markets, followed by daily necessities such as rice, coal, and oil. (3) Political Situation: Due to the political situation, transportation is hindered, freight rates have skyrocketed, and supplies are often lacking. (4) European War: The import market has been affected, and domestic goods have also risen accordingly. Although there has been a slight setback later, it is still far above the past levels. (5) Disappearance of Copper Coins and Shortage of Fractional Currency: The scarcity of small change makes it difficult to make exact change. Prices are affected invisibly, which is particularly unfavorable to the common people.

Monthly Changes in the Cost of Living in 1939: This year's cost of living index has been rising monthly. From January to May, the rate of increase was relatively slow. In March, the price of rice exceeded the limit of 14 yuan per picul. It continued to rise in April and May. Cloth prices also increased. Soybean oil and pork became more expensive due to transportation disruptions. The total index for March was 15.67, and it increased to 164.81 in May. Starting from June, the index rose even more sharply. In June and July, foreign exchange rates declined sharply repeatedly, and prices rose daily. In August, the price of rice exceeded the limit of 20 yuan per picul. In September, the European war broke out, and rice prices remained high, coupled with a sharp increase in fuel prices, which was unprecedented. The index reached 283.23. In October, the index decreased slightly to 248.22. Exchange rates eased, rice prices were lower, and the import market did not come to a complete standstill due to the European war. In November, rice prices rose again, foreign exchange tightened again, and the index continued to rise. By December, speculation and hoarding in the rice market reached a panic point. As rice prices rose, the prices of all goods increased accordingly. The index for December reached 304.06. At this point, one yuan of legal tender had only the purchasing power of 0.3189 yuan in 1936.

Categorized indices rose across the board. The fuel category was the most drastic. The index for January was 165.23, which rose to 397.33 in September and 351.96 in December. In the food category, rice prices soared, rising to 262.79 in September. Rice prices were even higher at the end of the year, reaching 318.08 in December. The housing category index was 169.80 in the first half of the year and rose to 282.41 in the second half of the year. The clothing category index was 143.85 in January and rose to 223.08 in December. The miscellaneous category index was the highest in December, at 226.85, an increase of 91.15 points compared to January.

Retail Prices in 1939: Prices rose uniformly this year. To clarify the extent of the increase over the past three years, the December prices of the 58 items included in the index are compared with the average prices in 1936, and listed below according to the increase percentage:

Among all items, rice accounts for 23.31% of the total expenditure of a worker's family. Therefore, the high price of rice has the most significant impact on the life of workers. In addition, rent is also an important burden. Before the war, the monthly rent for each room was only two or three yuan, but now it is six to nine yuan, an average increase of more than one and a half times. Workers' housing is often subleased, and landlords increase rents, while second-hand landlords also take the opportunity to profit. Or, under the pretext of increased water and electricity costs, they increase the rent in disguise, adding to the burden. As rents are high, overcrowded living conditions have become a common phenomenon. Moves are frequent throughout the year, as people seek cheaper housing and relocating is seen as a better option. Coal briquettes are the main fuel in households. The price increased three times in June of this year, from 1.6 yuan to 2.1 yuan per dan. In September, when the European war broke out, coal soared, and coal briquettes rose to more than four yuan per dan. It fell slightly afterward, but the average price in December reached 3.96 yuan. Soybean oil is necessary for seasoning. In the spring of this year and in 1936, it cost about 0.24 yuan per catty. By the end of this year, it cost one yuan per catty, an increase of more than three times in one year.

Wages and Working Hours

Overview of Wages in Various Industries: The collection of wage data is limited to Chinese factories. In 1939, wages for workers in various manufacturing industries were high. At the end of the year, there was a surge in labor strikes, demanding subsidies, which increased the fastest. This year's survey covered 15 industries, with data divided into wage rates and actual income. The average hourly wage rate for these 15 industries this year was 0.060 yuan, an increase of 9.09% compared to 1936 and 17.65% compared to the previous year. The average monthly actual income was 17.093 yuan, an increase of 19.09% compared to 1936 and 28.92% compared to the previous year. The following table briefly compares the increase or decrease in the wage rates and actual income of various industries this year with those of 1936 and 1938:

Among the industries, the most significant wage increases were in silk reeling, cotton spinning, cotton weaving, underwear, flour, and paper making. Due to a large increase in exports, silk reeling industry was experiencing a labor shortage, so factories were offering high salaries to attract workers, or even providing meals. Some factories were charging only 4.5 to 6 yuan per month for meals, while others provided free or low-cost accommodation, thereby increasing workers' actual income. In the latter half of the year, the transportation of autumn cocoons to Shanghai was greatly hindered. Due to a shortage of raw materials, many factories reduced production. At the same time, small factories were also being established in areas such as Hangzhou, Xichang, and Hecheng, where raw materials were readily available. The cotton spinning and cotton weaving industries prospered after the war due to increased demand and many speculators. They either increased wages, provided rice subsidies, or provided meals, so worker income was higher than before the war. Flour sales increased greatly because the poor switched to flour-based foods to save money as rice prices rose. Wages in the underwear and paper making industries also increased due to increased bonuses and lodging subsidies. Wages in the hosiery and tobacco industries increased slightly, but actual income decreased. The hosiery industry was booming last year, with many small factories. This year, due to rising raw material costs and sluggish sales in the interior, it had to reduce work, thus reducing the actual income of workers. The situation in the tobacco industry was the same. Not only was working time not extended, but most workers were rotated, so their income decreased. The match industry was not surveyed in 1937 and 1938 due to the impact of the war. Most of the factories surveyed this year were very small in scale, and wages were also low. The number of working days per month was not high, so the wage rate and actual income were lower than in 1936. (To be continued)

Happy Spring Festival is Here

A contribution to all men under heaven

Enjoy a happy love life, develop your career, guaranteed to achieve complete success!

The wheel of time is moving relentlessly forward. It is truly a time of pure and beautiful spring, and the joyous Spring Festival has quietly arrived in the world! This is a time when all people under heaven are celebrating and welcoming with joy! Especially men who have lovers, because spring brings countless joys and vitality, so spring can also be said to be the season for growing love. This feeling is conveyed to the hearts of lovers who yearn for spring, and how happy are their hearts! Thus, in an instant, they can be led to a state of passionate joy. Su Diudie, love is lingering and sweet, and life is so happy! At the same time, because of the encouragement of love, life becomes optimistic, and work becomes more interesting. Therefore, everything that is presented before you is bright and joyful!

A year's plan lies in spring, and the happiness of love requires a strong body. A strong body is the foundation for both love and career. If a man does not understand this principle and has committed masturbation, nocturnal emission, early marriage and indulgence, or unrestrained licentiousness in his early years, or if he has been injured by excessive worry and labor, and has lost the secretion of his reproductive glands, then the nerves of the brain, spinal cord, and sex organs will be in a weakened state due to lack of nourishment, developmental functions will stagnate, and metabolism will decline. Thus, symptoms such as premature ejaculation, impotence, incomplete development, scattered energy, kidney deficiency, lower back pain, weak memory, insomnia, and palpitations will be endless. Such weak men not only fail in their studies, fail to complete their studies, are abandoned by women, and fall into the tragic situation of unrequited love; they are hated by their wives and concubines, often leading to marital discord, or are subjected to humiliation due to jealousy, or even stage domestic tragedies such as adultery, elopement, divorce, and suicide.

If a man suffers from the above symptoms, in today's rapidly advancing new medicine, there are already the most effective and specific treatments: This is the "Reproducton," a tonic animal reproductive gland preparation invented by Professor Stenah, the leader of German medicine. This preparation is based on the most effective "supplement therapy" principle in new medicine. It has been proven by the chemical tests of many world-renowned doctors, as well as animal and clinical experiments, after more than 30 years of hard work. Therefore, its quality is precious, the production is exquisite, the brand is the oldest, the sales are the widest, the efficacy is definite, and the tonic power is great, which cannot be matched by any similar preparation. Therefore, it produces sperm and nourishes the kidneys, strengthens the brain and activates blood circulation in one day and night after taking it. Continuous consumption will further promote development, nourish nerves, and regulate metabolism. It will definitely cure various symptoms in a short period of time, making energy double. Middle-aged and elderly people who take it regularly will prolong their lives and rejuvenate. However, those suffering from nocturnal emission must also take the special medicine "Hemitol's Jing Solidifying Tablets" (available in Chinese and Western pharmacies such as Zhongxi Wuzhou Zhongying Huamei and the Western medicine department of Wing On Company, priced at two yuan per sale) to solidify the seminal duct and prevent leakage, so that the effect will be rapid!

Should prepare in advance, not dig a well when thirsty!

After the cold winter, tomorrow is the beginning of spring. Spring is the time when all things are alive, and young people are so full of vitality in spring! However, young people suffering from nocturnal emission not only have no vitality, but are also in danger! Why do young people suffer from nocturnal emission? According to medical judgment: mostly because of masturbation, homosexual intercourse, or excessive indulgence and abstinence, or excessive sorrow and fatigue, which destroy the sexual nerves and cause the seminal duct to relax. Once a young person has nocturnal emission, they should try to prevent and treat it. If they think it is painless and does not require treatment, then the secretion of the reproductive glands in the body (i.e., semen) will gradually feel depleted. The secretion of the reproductive glands is no different from the source of our life. If the brain, spinal cord, and sex organs become weakened due to the loss of nocturnal emission, the development function will stagnate, and metabolism will decrease. Then, symptoms such as brain decay, memory loss, insomnia, palpitations, lower back pain, kidney impotence, premature ejaculation, incomplete development, sallow complexion, emaciation, and premature aging will be endless. Such young people cannot store sperm in winter, and when spring arrives, they break out in spring epidemics, and many of them die young! As for those who are weakened and sick due to nocturnal emission, leading to tragic situations such as dropping out of school, abandoning careers, unrequited love, and marital discord, there are even more of them.

Nocturnal emission is not an incurable disease. Moreover, although it is still winter in spring, it is still possible to plan ahead! The method of treatment is to clear the mind and reduce desires, and at the same time take the special medicine "Hemi Evening's Jing Solidifying Tablets," which can immediately consolidate the seminal duct and calm the nerves, and can achieve the effect of falling asleep and stopping nocturnal emission that night? If nocturnal emission has been a long time and has the above symptoms, it is necessary to also take the strengthening animal reproductive gland preparation "Reproducton" to nourish the brain and kidneys, increase sperm and blood. Continuous consumption will further promote development, nourish nerves, and regulate metabolism. It will definitely cure various symptoms in a short period of time, making energy double and enjoying health and happiness forever. If patients can come to our clinic in person and receive new treatments such as electrotherapy injections, they can be guaranteed to be cured.

### General Review of Poor Breast Development

— Yao Chongpei, American Medical Doctor

Breasts are a natural endowment shared by women. Once puberty begins, two spherical peaks will naturally rise from the flat and rudimentary chest, the muscles are tense, the peak shape is firm, and it feels elastic when pressed. If there is no accidental destruction during this development, the degree of their height can reach two inches, which is the most valuable and standard beautiful breast for women in the modern trend.

The reason why beautiful breasts are valuable and worthy of attention is that, in addition to the extremely beautiful curves formed by the posture and the hips and waist, which make people intoxicated and infatuated, physiologically speaking, due to the health of the reproductive gland ovaries and the vigorous metabolism, the development of the torso is naturally very full and sufficient. As a result, the limbs are even, the hips are plump, the muscles are smooth, the thinking is agile, and the cheeks are even more flushed. Especially the temperament is gentle and docile. If a woman can possess these several conditions, then we men will naturally bow down to the cheongsam and shorts, and respectfully welcome and serve for fear of falling behind!

But then again, if you have committed chest binding, masturbation, leucorrhea, menstrual disorders, multiple births, loss of illness, indulgent and promiscuous etc., the breasts are either loose and drooping, or atrophied and small, and there are even those that are flat and have no peaks. With such an ugly state, even if you are full of powder and wearing brocade clothes, in the eyes of the forward-looking young people of the 20th century. I only feel stupid and hateful. Not only do I not love it, but even humiliate it and abandon it, so the tragedy of its fate can be imagined. To seek salvation, the end lies in prescribing the right medicine, and actively taking the reproductive gland ovarian endocrine preparation for women "Reproducton," which can start to nourish the ovarian function in one day and night, promote vigorous metabolism, regulate menstruation, warm the uterus and stop leucorrhea. If you continue to take it, even the most unsightly breasts can be transformed into towering ones with great medicinal power. After responsible proof by Chinese and foreign doctors and takers, it is considered to be the most sophisticated gynecological special medicine in modern times, which is not a false statement.

### Protracted Marriage Dispute Leads to Litigation - Man Requests Fulfillment of Marriage Contract - Woman Absent, Mediation Fails

Wang Miaojin, a woman from Huizhou who sings Suzhou ballads at the Tianyun House in Yong'an, with the stage name Wang Caiying, was engaged to Wu Xianglin, who works in customs. At that time, Wu gave an engagement gift of a diamond ring weighing one carat, a gold-inlaid diamond bracelet with twelve grains, etc. The matter was put on hold due to the August 13th Incident. The woman intended to renege on the marriage and filed a lawsuit in the Third Branch of the Second Special Court to terminate the engagement. The result was rejected in both cases. Wu also entrusted a lawyer to file a complaint with the First Special Court, requesting compensation for mental distress of 5,000 yuan. At that time, the woman sought reconciliation and promised to marry Wu.

Based on this, the court summoned a mediation hearing by Judge Liao Yuan in the Fourth Civil Court yesterday morning. The opposing party was absent. The court announced that the mediation in this case was unsuccessful and instructed the petitioner to formally file a lawsuit in this court.

### U.S. Reaction to the Yang Case - Yang's Crime is Slandering the Japanese Army in China - U.S. Public Opinion Becomes Increasingly Anti-Japanese

The English-language "Great America Evening Post" reported that the arrest of Yang, a correspondent for the American International News Agency, by the Tokyo authorities and the accusations against him have aroused concern among Americans and foreigners in Shanghai. One of the accusations is that Yang sent "38 articles with extremely defamatory news about the Japanese army fighting in various parts of China to the American News Agency headquarters and various Japanese newspapers and magazines."

Anti-Japanese Sentiment Intensifies

The American community in this city said that they may also be arrested if they go to Japan because they have said something about the Japanese army in Shanghai or the United States. The American community in this city believes that American public opinion will become increasingly anti-Japanese due to this action by the Japanese side.

Press Protest

Several influential figures in the American press have individually protested to Tokyo. Recalling that two years ago, various countries refused Japan's right to apply its laws to foreigners in the Japanese-occupied areas in China, but the Japanese side is now exercising this right and accusing Yang of committing crimes by sending information from China.

Freedom of Speech

According to general opinion, Yang, as a journalist, sent what he considered to be true news to the United States and Japan, which aroused the opposition of the Japanese authorities. If any journalist whose telegram is dissatisfied with the Japanese authorities arrives in Japan, they will likely be arrested. If so, the Japanese side is actually trying to prevent Americans from exercising their right to freedom of speech outside of Japan, and the possibility of Yang being handed over to a military court for trial will arouse even greater indignation in the United States.

### Arrival Dates of Two Postal Ships in Shanghai

The Zha Hua Postal Ship Company of He Shang, the new ship "Zhi Zha Lian Jia," decided to depart from Surabaya in the Dutch East Indies and come to China. It passed through Xiamen yesterday and is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow (5th). It will stay in Shanghai for three days, and on the 8th, it will set sail for Xiamen, Hong Kong, and return to Surabaya via various parts of the Nanyang region. It is reported that the American President's liner "President Da Hu Tuo" was damaged during its return voyage from Xiao Luzon to Shanghai and was docked for repairs in Hong Kong. The date of arrival in Shanghai has been changed to the 8th of this month. It is now learned that it may not be possible to arrive at that time, and it will have to be postponed for another two days, arriving in Shanghai on the 10th and departing for Japan and returning to the United States on the 11th.

### Chamber of Commerce Responds - Application for Patent Procedures

The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, in order to explain the application for patent procedures, replied to Mr. Wu Fuyuan in a letter, saying: "Regarding the inquiry about the application for patent procedures, the reply is as follows: (1) Apply to the Ministry of Economic Affairs; (2) When applying, you must prepare an application form, a detailed description of the invented item or method, illustrations, models or samples, and an affidavit; (3) After the application for a patent is approved, you must pay the certificate fee. The fee depends on the length of the patent period. For a patent of ten years, the fee is 80 yuan; for a patent of five years, the fee is 40 yuan. There is no need to pay in advance at this time; (4) For detailed information, you must read the full text of the Provisional Regulations for Encouraging Industrial Technology and its implementation rules. The Commercial Monthly of this association, Volume 19, Issues 1 and 5, have been published. You can purchase them from this association for 3 jiao per copy."

### Proof of Current National Methods - Up to Yesterday - Chamber of Commerce Spring Break for Four Days

The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, by order of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, will use the approved format for issuing certificates of domestic goods in order to avoid confusion in the future. It immediately notified the Joint Association of Chinese Yarn Factories, the Machinery Dyeing and Weaving Industry, the Cotton Cloth Industry, the Yarn Industry, the Needle and Green Beauty, the Underwear Weaving Industry, the Handkerchief Weaving Industry, and other trade associations, saying: "We are writing to inform you that we received a telegram from the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Industry Department, No. 50627, dated December, which was duly notified on the 29th by letter No. 9521. It is found that the format of this certificate is six-linked, and it takes time to print. Once it is printed, it will be implemented in accordance with the instructions of the Ministry. This association has many requests for certification from various factories, and each factory has as many as several hundred items per day. The manpower is limited, and there is a concern about backlog. In order to ensure clear boundaries and avoid mixing new and old sets, it is proposed that your association temporarily stop accepting requests for certification from various factories by February 3rd, so that the accumulated items can be processed in accordance with the current format within this year-end period. After February 4th, notify the factories to temporarily put aside the items and not send them until a separate notice is received from this association to re-transfer them according to the new method, so that the new and old boundaries can be clearly distinguished, so as to avoid accumulating more and more. This is of utmost importance. In addition, the association will have a spring break for four days from the 8th to the 11th of this month and will resume normal work on the 12th."

### Punishment for Using Counterfeit Bills

Xu Shounian from Jiangbei used a forged one-yuan bill of the Central Bank on Muer Ming Road on the 26th of last month. Tian Changchun, a Chinese detective from the Chengdu Road Police Station, arrested Xu and found seventeen forged Central Bank one-yuan bills and forty-five counterfeit double-corner tickets, which he took to the police station. Xu confessed that the counterfeit bills were bought from Miao Da (i.e., Miao Kaiyou). Later, Miao was also arrested and sent to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday morning, Judge Fu Lin presided over the continuation of the trial in the Second Criminal Court. The defendant, Miao Kaiyou, hired lawyer Qian Xingzhong to defend him. According to Xu Shounian's confession, the counterfeit bills were not bought from Miao Da, but were forgotten on his rickshaw by a passenger who got off at the intersection of Sima Road and Hubei Road on the 16th of the lunar December. Miao Da denied selling counterfeit bills, saying that he usually made a living by lending money and that he had fought with Xu because Xu had borrowed money from him and had not repaid it, so he was falsely accused. He also invited his wife, Huang Chen, to testify, but her testimony did not match Miao's. Judge Fu verified the confession and sentenced Xu Shounian to one year and six months in prison for using counterfeit coins. Miao Kaiyou (i.e., Miao Da) was found not guilty, but Miao was found to have engaged in usury and should be sent to the police station for investigation.

### Sending New Year's Lucky Money Red Envelopes - A Sensation in Shanghai - Free of Charge, Popular with Everyone - Everyone is Happy and Wishes You Progress Every Year

Ye Cheng Industrial Company is providing 300,000 red envelopes for lucky money for all users of Daxi toothpaste to add to the joy of the Lunar New Year (while supplies last). Starting from today, anyone who purchases one tube of Daxi toothpaste, Shuangxi toothpaste, or Yongbei toothpaste can get five red envelopes for free from the sales store. If you take one empty tube of the above three types of toothpaste to each sales store, you can exchange it for one Daxi coupon and get five red envelopes for free. Therefore, buying one tube of toothpaste can get ten red envelopes for free, which is worth two jiao. Each tube of toothpaste only sells for two jiao and five fen. If you ask if five fen can buy a tube of toothpaste besides two jiao, the company's sacrifice is a new record that has not been seen since the promotion of gifts. But there are not many bags, so if you want to get them, hurry up, otherwise you will inevitably regret it too late and only sigh in vain. It is heard that since Daxi toothpaste advocated being used as a wedding favor, many people have adopted it, which shows that the hearts of the people in Shanghai have progressed with the times and eliminated unnecessary consumption.

### Letters

We are writing to inform you that, according to Sun Renjie, on the 27th of last month, he read a news item in your newspaper's news column titled "Retired Detective Commits Fraud and Seizes Money, Arrested in Brothel," which was very strange because the facts are very different from the news. The facts are briefly stated as follows: The person concerned knows Mr. Shen Jiuru of Tongcheng Silk Factory, who operates the silkworm cocoon industry in Wuxi and entrusts him with shipping, with multiple decisions and no difficulties along the way, thereby making huge profits. However, in addition to the driver's license that should be transported to the goods, Shen secretly transported more than 10,000 yuan worth of goods, which was detained by a certain party in Nantong. When the person concerned heard about it, he felt deeply sorry. However, Shen and others repaid kindness with hatred, even wrongly attributing it and using illegally obtained financial power to falsely report to the police, claiming that the person concerned had defrauded and collected money to compensate for the loss of the secretly transported goods being detained. The complainant was Xie Dian, whom the person concerned did not know, not Shen Jiuru, which was very confusing. Later, after investigation by the police, it was learned that the person concerned was wrongly accused and the police instructed that the matter not be accepted. The Shanghai First Special District Local Court overturned the detention case. The person concerned did not commit fraud. How can the law allow it? Therefore, we specially entrust your lawyer to write to your newspaper to correct the previously published news in order to clarify right and wrong and conform to the facts, etc. Accordingly, we hereby inform you, hoping that you will investigate and make corrections. Sincerely, to the chief editor of Shen Bao, lawyer Shi Jiutang, February 2nd.

We are writing to inform you that we have recently read in your newspaper that 56 rickshaw merchants, including Yong Lichun and Li Bingyi, filed a criminal complaint against Qiu Chunshan, Zhou Jinshan, and Qin Yizhou, the standing committee members and chairman of the Rickshaw Industry Association, for breach of trust and embezzlement of 2,250 yuan in security deposits returned by the municipal government to the rickshaw merchants, and attached a civil lawsuit, etc. Judge Zhang of the Second Special Court tried the case, and Wang Bingjun, the lawyer representing the complainants, stated that the civil lawsuit part has been settled and requested permission to withdraw it, and that the criminal part should be tried according to law, etc. According to this, we are very surprised. According to lawyer Wang, the lawyer representing the complainants, when the complainants filed the lawsuit, they did not know that the defendants had purchased national salvation bonds with the security deposit. Now they have witnessed it clearly. The facts are in place, and the act of saving the country is a good thing. The civil part requests withdrawal, and the criminal part requests that the defendants be declared not guilty, etc. Moreover, Chunshan and others withdrew money from the Shanghai Municipal Bank and purchased national salvation bonds from the Bank of China, and there are ticket stubs that can be verified, which have been submitted to the case for verification. The settlement mentioned in your newspaper is a mistake in the publication. We hope that it will be corrected. Sincerely, to the chief editor of Shen Bao, Qiu Chunshan, Qin Yizhou, and Zhou Jinshan, the standing committee members of the Shanghai Rickshaw Industry Association, February 3rd.

### Weather Report

The Xujiahui Observatory's weather forecast at 4:30 PM yesterday stated that Shandong and its surroundings were sunny and very cold, with strong seasonal winds. There was snowfall around Korea, and the East China Sea was changing from cloudy to overcast, with strong seasonal winds. In addition, in the 24 hours before 3:00 PM yesterday, the highest temperature in this city was 34.3 degrees and the lowest was 13.5 degrees.

The Shanghai-Hong Kong Interport Football Tournament, which has been interrupted for three years due to the war, has been restored this year after consultations between the two sides by letter and telegram. It is scheduled to be held on Lunar New Year's Day at the Yiyuan in Shanghai. The lineup of players and the order of matches for both sides have been announced, with a total of three matches. Yesterday, Hong Kong telegraphed that the Hong Kong Interport team, consisting of fourteen players, led by team manager Ji Pei and captain Da Gausanu, has set off northward. The strength of the team has inevitably weakened due to the refusal of Chinese players from Hong Kong to participate. Xia Xian, a center back from the Hong Kong team, was selected, marking a new era for Indian players to be selected for the Interport team. Hong Kong team captain Da Gausanu has been selected as an Interport representative in 1926, 1927, 1928, 1929, 1930, 1931, 1933, 1934, 1935, and 1937, making him a very experienced player. The Shanghai representative team was originally scheduled to practice twice, but the first time (1st) was canceled due to rain. The second time is scheduled for 12:00 noon the day after tomorrow (6th), and the location is still Yiyuan. According to the history of the Hong Kong-Shanghai Interport Match, which began in 1908, the Hong Kong team won. It continued to be held in 1913, and the Shanghai team won. It was then suspended for ten years. Since its resumption in 1923, it has never been interrupted until 1937. In the fifteen years, Shanghai won nine times and Hong Kong won six times. This time, it has been suspended until now due to the war. The order of the Interport matches and the lineups of each team are recorded as follows:

In addition, the team's fourth practice race is scheduled to start at 7:30 this morning at Guangxia Middle School on Muer Ming Road, with both fast and slow paper practice.

### Sudden Surge of Financial Rumors, Gold Market Soars Outside the Market, Reaching Over 4,260 Yuan

Yesterday's spot gold black market situation initially declined but then rose. After breaking through the 4,200 yuan mark, it rebounded again. However, the result was a nominal decrease of 7 yuan, but an actual squeeze of more than 20 yuan. The opening this morning was 4,210 yuan, a nominal decrease of 27 yuan compared to yesterday. The reason was the easing of foreign exchange, with money changers and securities firms releasing supply. It soon fell another 20 yuan under selling pressure, reaching a low of 4,190 yuan. Later, gold firms and a certain securities firm acted as agents for the Tianjin group to cover short positions, and foreign exchange also softened. In addition, a certain money changer acting as an agent for the Hong Kong group also followed suit and gathered supplies, leading to a period of firmness, rising to a high of 4,245 yuan. Unfortunately, the good times were short-lived, and the foreign exchange market suddenly reported firmness again, triggering vigorous selling by retail investors, and it fell again to 4,220 yuan. However, the buying momentum of securities firms revived at noon, so the noon close was still 4,130 yuan. There was no market trading in the afternoon, but the trend outside the market turned firm again, due to the sudden rise of rumors in the market. Gold firms and securities firms were acting as agents for the Tianjin group to search for supplies. It was reported that the final price had reached as high as 4,260 yuan. Trading was still brisk for half a day, at more than 1,300 taels. Jewelry gold initially declined but then returned to flat. Customs gold remained stable.

Nominal Decrease, Actual Increase

Since the morning, the initial opening was 27 yuan lower due to the hardening of the foreign exchange market and a weary mentality. A certain money changer took the lead in selling at a lower price. Soon after, a certain securities firm also came to sell, causing the opening to be pushed down by 27 yuan. A securities firm appeared, and a gold firm sold 10 taels for 4,210 yuan. Shortly after, they lowered the price by another 20 yuan, and a securities firm sold 20 taels to a certain bank for 4,190 yuan. Subsequently, as the foreign exchange market tightened, gold firms came to buy, and another securities firm also came to support, causing the price to rebound by 45 yuan. A securities firm bought 30 taels from a gold firm for 4,135 yuan. At that time, a certain bank released supply on behalf of retail investors, immediately retreating to 4,226 yuan. Unexpectedly, at this time, the Hong Kong group suddenly showed buying momentum, vigorously entrusting money changers and gold firms to buy, and the price soared another 19 yuan. A money changer bought 30 taels from a gold firm for 4,245 yuan. After this, because the foreign exchange suddenly reported firmness again, retail investors immediately took advantage of the high price to sell, and the Hong Kong group had stopped its activities, so the price gradually declined. A securities firm sold 30 taels to a gold firm, falling to 4,220 yuan. Subsequently, as securities firms bought, and a certain jewelry store also provided support, the price rose again by 15 yuan. A securities firm bought 20 taels from a money changer for 4,235 yuan. Later, spot gold firms sold, falling again by 12 yuan. A spot gold firm sold 20 taels to a securities firm for 4,223 yuan. Near the close, gold firms came to buy, pulling up the price by 7 yuan, buying 10 taels each from money changers and jewelry stores, all for 4,230 yuan, as the noon closing price. As a result, it was a nominal decrease of 7 yuan compared to the previous day, with a fluctuation of 55 yuan. In the afternoon, due to the Saturday settlement holiday, a huge wave arose outside the market. Because gold firms and securities firms vigorously bought, the price rose from 4,238 yuan to over 4,260 yuan. Unsubstantiated rumors also prevailed. The price showed an increase of more than 20 yuan compared to the previous day. The capital gold of spot gold firms was also several yuan higher than the final price, but they bought in at 20 yuan lower. The capital gold of spot gold firms was 60 yuan lower, and no deals were made.

Jewelry Gold Initial Decline Then Rebound

The asking price for jewelry gold was initially still 430 yuan per tael, but it was lowered by 5 yuan at 9:30 AM and rebounded by 5 yuan at 2:30 PM, resulting in a flat price. Major jewelry stores still had the original price of 430 yuan, and the new jewelry stores had the same price. The buying price was reduced by about 15 yuan.

### Foreign Currencies Turn Upward in the Afternoon

Yesterday, the fluctuations in foreign currencies were intense again. The market situation was quite loose in the morning, but rumors spread widely in the afternoon, and the market situation suddenly tightened. In the early morning, the supply of British and American gold pounds increased, and the market situation was soft. In the afternoon, absorption became more enthusiastic, and the market price was firm. As a result, it rose slightly compared to the previous night. British gold notes fell to 49.70 yuan in the morning, and American gold notes fell to 13.26 yuan. In the afternoon, rumors spread that a financial meeting would be held in Hong Kong, and many parties actively absorbed, and the market situation was tight. In the evening market, British gold notes rose to 50.025 yuan, and American gold notes rose to 13.40 yuan. Hong Kong notes initially fell and then rose, with no historical results. The demand for French franc notes and Annam notes increased. The supply of Singapore and Dutch notes became scarce, and the market situation was slightly firm. Philippine notes followed the upward trend and rose uniformly. Japanese gold notes were slightly weaker, with the evening market at 1.252 yuan. Korean notes were weak and sluggish, with the evening market at 1.005 yuan.

### Hong Kong Still Has Hedged Selling, Foreign Exchange Supply Exceeds Demand

The foreign exchange market situation yesterday: The HSBC exchange rate did not fluctuate. The black market for British and American exchange only had a half-day market, with small fluctuations and a slightly firm trend, mainly due to the outflow of Hong Kong cables and the selling by American Bank Datong and other banks. The hardening of exchange rates in Tianjin also reduced the activity of the Tianjin group. As for the half-day situation, the opening was flat, still at 4/10/84375 and 7.4375 yuan. Later, due to the outflow of Hong Kong cables and the willingness of American banks to sell, although the Western firm Sassoon occasionally came to buy, the supply still exceeded demand, showing a slight hardening. At that time, British gold was quoted at 4/10/8 and American exchange reached 7.46875 yuan. Subsequently, HSBC suddenly turned around and absorbed, and the Japanese Bank Zhengjin also bought. However, thanks to the willingness of American banks to sell, the situation once returned to flat. However, the closing result was still at 4/10/8 and 7.46875 yuan, a further decrease of 0.015625 and 0.03125 compared to the previous day. The potential trend of futures was the same as that of spot, but the current month's rate was slightly higher than the spot rate, with a distance of only 0.015625 and 0.03125 at noon.

Sassoon Has Made Settlements

In the early morning, London's big deals were up by 0.0625 for both near and far terms, New York's silver price remained flat, and London's raw gold was stable. The exchange rates of British to American and British to French were flat, while those to Shanghai shrank by 0.0125. American to British rose by 0.075, to French by a large fraction, and to Shanghai by a small fraction. The Central Bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. The bank's morning opening spot selling price was British gold at 4/10/84375 and American exchange at 7.4375, with no increase or decrease compared to the previous close. After the opening, Hong Kong cables took the lead in selling, and a certain bank also showed a willingness to supply. However, Sassoon took the opportunity to absorb, and the supply still felt in excess of demand, so the market trend slightly hardened. It was calculated that Hong Kong cables released spot American exchange to foreign banks at 7.46875 yuan, and a certain bank sold Sassoon's current month's American exchange at 10625 yuan. At that time, the current order was 4/10/8, and it could be settled. HSBC's listed prices were revealed to be unchanged, and the silver balance tax was revealed to be a large fraction. After that, HSBC suddenly came to buy, and the Japanese Bank Zhengjin also bought, causing the market situation to return to flat. It was calculated that HSBC absorbed spot British gold from other banks Datong Huabi at 4/10/84375, and the Japanese Bank bought the current month's American exchange from a certain bank at 7.375 yuan. Subsequently, the buyers were content, and American banks were quite willing to supply, so the market image became slightly loose again, hardening to 4/10/8 and 7.46875 yuan. Until about 11 o'clock, although Hong Kong cable speculators came to buy March American exchange, the supply of American banks was still good, so there was no impact. Until the close, British gold was still at 4/10/8, and American exchange was still at 7.46875 yuan. The current month's British balance was 4/10/84375, and American exchange was 7.4375. The next month's term British gold was 4/10/821875, and American exchange was 7.3125. As a result, the spot British was 0.015625 cheaper, and the American was 0.033125 cheaper than the previous day. The current month's British was 0.03125 higher, and the American was 0.0625 harder. The next month's term looseness was the same as the spot. There was no market on Saturday afternoon.

Hong Kong Exchange Market Unchanged

Hong Kong, February 3: According to a telegram, the exchange market opened flat this morning. British, American, and Japanese exchange rates were unchanged. The Shanghai exchange rate decreased by 2 yuan to 328 yuan. The market stabilized at 11:30, and there were no changes in the exchange rates. There was no market on Saturday afternoon.

### Coal: Coal Balls Approach 100 Yuan Per Ton, Retail Price Still 4.8 Yuan

Coal ball prices: In the previous month, due to the soaring prices of raw coal dust and water freight, the price was increased three times in two weeks, creating a new record of 90 yuan, which was already shocking. Unexpectedly, near the end of the year, factories such as Nanyang, Dongfang, and Guanghua took advantage of the strong business and continued to increase the factory price by 6 yuan, with the price from the car at 96 yuan per ton and delivered at 98 yuan. The retail price at the door is still 4.8 yuan per dan (20 dan per ton. If distribution stores sell at the fixed price, they get a net profit of 96 yuan per ton, which means that there is still a loss of 2 yuan for the car force. What is the purpose of small traders losing their energy and money? Therefore, there are many criticisms in the market, and it is planned to oppose it. It is hoped that the Coal Ball Industry Association will pay attention to it).

### Grain: Rice Prices Differ by More Than 30 Yuan in One Year. The City Has About One Million Bags of Rice in Stock. Rice Prices May Fall in the Coming Spring

Yesterday was the last day of the major closure of the rice market. Arrivals had ceased, and there were few transactions. Merchants had no samples to show, and only a few return cargoes were traded slightly, so there was not much increase or decrease in the market. The prices were: Saigon No. 1 at 42.8 yuan, Saigon No. 2 at 41.7 yuan, Fire Jiao at 41.8 yuan, and Aoyang White at 41 yuan. All other goods were unsold. In short, the rice market has ended today and will have to wait for the red market to reopen in the coming spring. As for when the market will reopen, it will be announced after the Rice Industry Association makes a decision, but it will most likely be on the fifth or sixth day of the lunar new year. In total, the rise and fall of the Geng rice market this year, from the white粳of 13-14 yuan at the beginning of the year, and then a leap, accumulated day by day, was nothing but an increase. Taking the highest price of white粳 of 48 yuan before the price limit, the annual rice price increase reached a huge 34-35 yuan, which is an unprecedented phenomenon. At present, the inventory in Shanghai, according to industry insiders, is about 370,000-80,000 bags in the district, including the various粳and尖goods stored in various warehouses and shops. The amount stored in the Hongkou district and Pudong, such as Shuntai Warehouse, Gonghexing, Qichang, and other warehouses, is more than 300,000 bags, and the amount stored in general warehouses is no less than 200,000 bags. Therefore, the total inventory in the city is nearly one million bags. What's more, the source of supply from the mainland will continue to arrive in the coming spring, so there is hope for the price of rice to fall in Shanghai.

### The Process of Repaying Principal and Interest on Domestic and Foreign Debt in the Past Two Years

Since the start of the War of Resistance, three years have passed in a blink of an eye. Although the finances are stretched, efforts have been made to raise funds within the possible range to maintain debt credibility for domestic and foreign debts. Until the beginning of 1939, most of the income from customs and salt taxes was plundered, and many of the state-owned railways were lost. The wartime public debt policy was slightly changed, and the convenience of overdrafts was no longer provided. Furthermore, the decline in the foreign exchange price of legal tender further weakened the ability to repay debts. Therefore, the principal and interest payments on foreign loans were successively announced to be suspended. At the same time, the domestic debt fund did not fare any differently. Taking the unity, revitalization, and gold long-term bonds as examples, the principal and interest for the first half of 1938 were once paid in remittances. In the second half of the year, the method of paying in legal tender was restored. In the first half of 1939, there were two changes, which were changed to Shanghai paying legal tender in six equal installments, with one installment paid each month. In the second half of the year, it was changed again to discounting by the four banks, and Shanghai paying remittances in six installments. In addition to these types, the rest were not widely circulated outside. Although the principal and interest were also discounted by the four banks, the payment in Shanghai was made in one lump sum in remittances or Chongqing drafts. The process of non-payment of principal and interest on various domestic and foreign debts is listed as follows.

A. Bonds Managed by the Ministry of Finance

Yesterday, the price of foreign rice was reduced and then increased due to the shrinking and growing exchange rate, and there were continued transactions for fixed goods. It was reported that 2,000 tons of small絞formerly priced at 51 yuan were ordered yesterday at 50.07 yuan, which was handled by grain merchants. There were also several other agreements that have not been announced. The current Western货 owners are still firmly standing firm, with the number one at 42.7 yuan and the number two at 41.3 yuan.

Yesterday, foreign rice also arrived in Shanghai, with Taikoo Company's Suzhou ship bringing 13,053 bags from Hong Kong and Jardine Matheson's Desheng ship bringing 16,750 bags from Hong Kong, for a total of 19,803 bags, which have already begun to be unloaded. (祖)

### Flour Market Ends - Market Closed for Eight Days Starting Today

The flour market already showed signs of ending yesterday. The current flour trading has also been invisibly suspended. There are still a small number of transactions with old customers who purchase from manufacturers, with amounts of only 30-50 bags and 100-200 bags. The price of return cargoes has repeatedly increased, and the owners are very willing to hoard the goods and refuse to release them, waiting for a good price in the red market. The official market will have to wait until the red market in the new year. The Miscellaneous Grain Market announced that the market will be closed for eight days from February 4 to 11. Wheat trading has also ended.

Tomorrow (5th), 28,200 bags of flour will be exported to Xiamen and 500 bags to Hong Kong. 3,725 bags of beans will be transported to Hong Kong and 1,290 bags to Xiamen. In addition, 3,800 bales of soybean cake, 100 cans of crude oil, and 2,370 bags of raw peanuts will be transported to Hong Kong, along with 2,569 cans of crude oil.

### Securities: Bonds of the Twenty-Eighth Year Rose More Often

The black market for securities yesterday was the last day of the Lunar New Year. The red market will not open until the fifth day of the new year, which is February 12. Yesterday's market had turned stronger, and there was a lot of short covering in the market, but there were also many spot goods flowing out for offsetting, so the market did not change much. Type A has been set to hold the ninth drawing on the 7th, and the number is 26, so the price has risen more. The morale in the market is quite stable. The majority of people are bullish on the red market, but it also requires the assistance of the situation. If the environment does not change, there is often hope for a rising trend.

According to the whole year of the 28th year, the most important turmoil was on the 19th of a certain month, when it was suddenly reported that the principal and interest would be stopped, but then it was changed to pay with remittances, which was paid by Zhongzhongjiao. It calmed down in a few days. The rest of the process can be said to be stable. On average, the time for rising is longer than the time for falling, partly because most speculators have switched to goods and have no time to do this, and partly because there is plenty of floating capital, firm belief, and occasional surges of peaceful air. After this, the term of the bonds themselves gradually shortened, and the number of draws gradually increased. Although the fact of peace is still far away, it is ultimately getting closer and closer. Other goods are gradually losing their speculative nature. Investment is arising because of speculation, so it should gradually become lively after the red market.

The final market prices of yesterday and their comparisons are listed below. The turnover for half a day was about 400,000 yuan.

Stock trading: 20 shares of Huacheng Tobacco Company were traded at a price of 36 yuan.

Yesterday, the stock market of the Public Industry Association had an amazing development, with enthusiastic buying and soaring prices. Industrial stocks and rubber stocks have all risen to new highs.

London, February 2: According to a telegram, the listed prices of Chinese foreign debt remained stable today. There were no changes in the bonds on the upper and lower floors.

London, February 2: According to a telegram, the listed prices of stocks of British Far East companies were all stable today. There were no increases or decreases in the various stocks.

### Yarn and Cotton: Yarn Market Initially Declined and Then Rebounded, Cotton Silent

The yarn market initially declined and then rebounded, and the results were still stable, but the actual demand was not very strong. In fact, there are not many days left in the year, and even if the yarn is processed well, it will not be able to be shipped to the destination quickly, so we will wait for the coming spring to start again. The market will be closed from Monday until February 12, which is the fifth day, and then the market will reopen. Therefore, the market situation is peaceful, but the turnover for this month is unusually strong. The future of the yarn market is mostly dependent on the expansion and contraction of exchange rates.

At the opening of the yarn market this morning, the mood was soft because the market situation in the afternoon of the previous day was weak, and the foreign exchange was also lengthened yesterday, which further weakened the momentum. The opening price of 20-count Shuangma was 760 yuan. As soon as this price was opened, sellers were enthusiastic, and the market gradually declined to 754 yuan. However, the financial sector still came to buy, and it rebounded to 760 yuan. According to the transaction statistics for half a day, 2,555 bales were traded. The price of 20-count Shuangma was slightly lower than the previous day by 3-4 yuan. The amount purchased by each gang is listed on the left.

Tomorrow (5th), 35 pieces of yarn will be transported to Siam, 250 pieces to Hong Kong, 235 pieces of cloth will be transported to Hong Kong, and 175 pieces to Xiamen, and 115 pieces to Siam.

Cotton trading: Because of the approaching end of the year, everyone is preparing to spend the year, and they are not interested in business. However, in the overseas cotton market, although American cotton is flat, Indian cotton has rebounded again, so most of the industry has a bullish view. According to statistics, there are 664 bales of Tong cotton from northern Jiangsu.

According to another report on the overseas cotton market, the New York cotton market has been relatively quiet recently. At the opening this morning, it rose by more than 10 pounds due to purchases by overseas merchants in the market. Later, due to selling by the public and the conclusion of some price limits, the market situation slightly weakened. However, compared with the closing price of the previous day, the near term still rose by 3 pounds and the far term rose by 6-7 pounds. India rose by 1 rupee yesterday, Egypt fell by more than 10 pounds, and Liverpool was stable.

Shanghai's foreign cotton trading: Because all the industries are about to close for the year, they all intend to spend the end of the year quietly and do not want to talk about transactions this year. Therefore, it has been quite quiet in recent days. However, the factories' intention to purchase raw cotton is weaker than usual. According to predictions from Japanese manufacturers, foreign cotton trading will become active after the new year. The delivered factory price of yesterday's cotton market, converted at an exchange rate of 7.4375 yuan for American exchange, is as follows:

### Sugar Market: Stockholders Buy Sugar

Because the foreign exchange market tightened and stockholders continued to buy sugar in the sugar market yesterday and the day before, the price rose again. The association's drawing price for spot 24 rough white was 59 yuan for the local warehouse, 59.2 yuan for the newly arrived foreign warehouse, 59 yuan for the old goods, and 47.5 yuan for the re-exported goods. Foreign firms offered 300 tons of rough folding, with the price at 7 Dutch shields. Taikoo Chebai's West Warehouse B mark was 59 yuan, East Warehouse was 58.5 yuan, CW Lou was 57.5 yuan, West Warehouse was 58 yuan, and the rest were refunded. H mark was 42 yuan, Dutch red rose to 45 yuan. The number one original white from Benmian Zhenji was 59 yuan, the number two was 58.5 yuan, the number one rock sugar was 70.5 yuan, and the Jingming rock sugar was 72 yuan. There was a lack of domestic sugar in the market, and 100 bags of sugar were shipped from Xiamen on the 3rd.

### North-South Goods: North Goods Cannot Be Transported South

According to a letter from a Xuzhou customer, all North goods from Tianjin, Jinan, Xuzhou, and other ports are not allowed to be transported south, because a certain party is controlling it. If so, red and black dates, golden needle vegetables, peanuts, raw melon seeds, and other goods will not be able to be transported to Shanghai in the coming spring. Even if they can be reconnected, the special expenses will inevitably increase, and the market will inevitably rise in the future.

### Understanding the Basic Relationship Between China and Siam

— Bi Songshi

The Significance of Siam's Name Change

Siam's change of its name to Thailand, it is said, was initiated by Prime Minister Plaek Phibunsongkhram in order to "inspire the Thai people to rejoice in their own freedom and independence, and thereby unite and cooperate to lead the Thai people into a prosperous realm." Following this, Thailand launched an anti-Chinese movement. Until recently, the Bangkok News stated that the anti-Chinese movement had gradually subsided. Therefore, the relationship between the Siamese people and the Han people, and how to improve Sino-Siamese relations, are worthy of our study.

According to recent news: The Central Government, in view of the long history of economic and cultural ties between the Chinese and Siamese peoples, and the slight estrangement in recent years, since Chairman Chiang Kai-shek telegraphed Thai Prime Minister Plaek Phibunsongkhram in November of last year, during the Sixth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Committee in Chongqing, requesting him to protect Chinese nationals in Siam, and Prime Minister Plaek Phibunsongkhram replied by telegram expressing his concern for the overseas Chinese, Sino-Thai relations have entered a new stage. Therefore, it is even more necessary for us to understand Thailand.

The Relationship Between the Thai People and the Southwestern Ethnic Groups

The Thai or Tai ethnic group in the Siamese language has a broad scope. In Guangdong and Guangxi on the mainland, they are commonly referred to as the "Dong" (徸, pronounced "Zhuang") ethnic group, the "Dan" (　, pronounced "Dan") ethnic group, and the　ethnic group. On Hainan Island, they are commonly referred to as the Li and Qi ethnic groups. In Yunnan, they are commonly referred to as the Baiyi, Baiyi, and Cuan ethnic groups. In Guizhou, they are commonly referred to as the　Jia, Yi Jia, and Gelao ethnic groups. In Sichuan, they are commonly referred to as the Keluo (now under the jurisdiction of Xikang). In French Indochina, they are commonly referred to as the　Ren and Nong Ren ethnic groups. In British Indochina (i.e., Burma), they are commonly referred to as the Hui Ren ethnic group. The Tui Ren refer to themselves as the "Little Thai," while referring to the Shan people as the "Great Thai." All of the above-mentioned ethnic groups belong to the same lineage in terms of blood relations. Their languages and customs are largely the same. The Dong people of Guangdong and Guangxi are even closer to the Siamese people. The Dong people can listen to broadcasts from Bangkok. For example, calling fish "Ba," calling cows "Huai," calling ducks "Bi," calling pigs "Mo," calling stones "Tun," calling water "Lan," calling houses "Lan," and calling villages "Ban," the Siamese and Dong languages are exactly the same.

In ancient times, Thailand was the territory of Yuechang, and later entered the kingdom of Funan. Only after annexing Luohu in the south at the beginning of the fourteenth century did it establish itself as Siam.

The 　Ethnic Group in Chinese History

Although Siam claims to be a Thai ethnic group, in Chinese history, it is only known as the Cuan, not the Thai. That Thai is Cuan is obvious. The English translation of the Thai character is "Tai," and the Dong pronunciation of the Cuan character is "Taiun." Now that Siam has changed its name to Thailand, it is actually the same as the Cuan Kingdom. History states that the Cuan clan originally had the　surname and was descended from Zixun, the Prime Minister of the State of Chu. At the end of the Western Han Dynasty, they received fiefs in Cuan, and thus became the Cuan clan. During Zhuge Liang's southern expedition, Cuan Xi was appointed as an official. After that, through the Jin Dynasty to the Northern and Southern Dynasties, many great officials of the Cuan clan emerged, and the imperial court placed great importance on them. During the Tang and Song Dynasties, Nanzhao and Dali were independent, and they became estranged from the Chinese motherland for six hundred years. This is a very regrettable thing. However, during the reign of Emperor Xizong of the Tang Dynasty, Princess Anhua was still married to Nanzhao. During the reign of Emperor Zhuangzong of the Later Tang Dynasty, Nanzhao again requested a marriage with a red-maned white horse from the Southern Han Kingdom, which dominated Guangdong and Guangxi at the time, and the Southern Han also married Princess Zengcheng to them. The Cuan was one of the Han ethnic tribes and had special relationships with the Central Plains, Guangdong, and Guangxi. The connection between the Thai people and the Chinese motherland can be known without asking.

Future Sino-Thai Relations

The close relationship between China and Thailand is as described above. What is regrettable is that until today, China and Siam still do not have normal diplomatic relations. Now that the Chinese diplomatic authorities realize that Sino-Thai relations require special attention during the War of Resistance against Japan, they naturally hope to conclude a treaty of amity with Thailand in the shortest possible time. Only in this way can Sino-Thai relations be enhanced, and can Chinese nationals in Siam be guaranteed!

### The Important Place in Eastern Zhejiang - Jinhua

— Guan Qing

Historical Evolution: Jinhua belonged to Yangzhou - one of the Nine Provinces during the Three Dynasties. According to Du You's Tongdian, it belonged to Kuaiji Prefecture during the Qin and Han Dynasties, and was Dongyang Prefecture during the Six Dynasties. Jinhua Prefecture was established during the Chen Dynasty - Jinhua Prefecture was established during the Ming Dynasty, and the Qing Dynasty followed suit. Jinhua was the leading county. After the establishment of the Republic of China, the prefecture system was abolished, so it is now called Jinhua.

Geographical Situation: According to the County Chronicles, "It is known as a beautiful place of mountains and rivers in the southeast. Changshan (i.e., Jinhua Mountain, commonly known as Beishan) is embraced in the north, Furong (i.e., Furong Peak, commonly known as Jianfeng Mountain) stands out uniquely, Ruoyang (i.e., Zhinan Mountain) stands tall in the south, and Fucang Mountain welcomes from afar, forming a forest like halberds, standing as a screen. The two rivers (i.e., Yongkang Port and Yiwu Port) meander and converge under the city. It is truly a creation of nature to gather the beauty of one region. Moreover, it occupies the throat and collar of Ouku (referring to Wenzhou and Chuzhou) above, and the lips and teeth of Yan (i.e., Jiande County) and Qu below. It is indeed an important area of the two Zhejiang provinces, not comparable to the shape of a remote lower county." If we examine Jinhua's geographical and transportation situation, it is worthy of these words. The most dangerous places in Jinhua are the three caves of Chaozhen, Binghu, and Shuanglong. These three caves are the "Jinhua Dongyuan Heaven" of the "Thirty-Six Cave Heavens" mentioned in Taoist books. Among the three caves, Shuanglong is the lowest, Chaozhen is the highest, and Binghu is in between. The water of the three caves flows down successively, murmuring and gurgling, the curtains fly and the beads scatter, the darkness and light change, and it is difficult to fully appreciate. Currently, Provincial Chairman Huang Shaoxiong has allocated 3 million yuan to build many air-raid shelters in the area, which can accommodate more than 10,000 people in total. Southwest of the city is Tongji Bridge, which is built entirely of bluestone, with thirteen arches, more than 300 steps long and more than ten steps wide. The road faces the two streams, and the project can be called magnificent. Although the commercial development there is not as significant as before the war, the increase in residents (from Jiangsu Province) has naturally benefited it invisibly. Therefore, in this situation of economic depression, the Jinhua market is not very desolate. Those who control Jinhua's commerce are not the local natives, but the Huizhou and Shaoxing merchants, and there are not many Ningbo merchants who are good at trading.

Transportation Overview: The current situation in Jinhua is slightly different from before due to convenient transportation. The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, from Xiaoshan (across the Qiantang River from Hangzhou) to Gan County in Jiangxi, takes Jinhua as its center point, so a branch line from Jinhua goes to Lanxi. Now, the section to Nanchang has been destroyed by the National Army when retreating to Changsha. As for the highway, eastward it reaches Wenzhou directly via Yongkang and Wuyi; southwest and west it reaches Longyou and Quzhou directly via Lanxi, and even Jiangshan. From Jiangshan to the southwest, it can reach Gan County in Jiangxi, and then transfer to Changsha, Guiyang, and Zhijiang to reach the new capital Chongqing directly. Southwest of Guiyang, there is a highway to Kunming. Recently, a road through the city from the Jin-Yong-Wu bus station to the railway station has been built to connect them. The convenience of transportation is a hundred times better than before the war.

Current Educational Situation: In the inland areas of Zhejiang Province, Jinhua's education has always been relatively developed, second only to Jiangshan outside of Hangzhou. Currently, there are five middle schools in the urban area, three for boys and two for girls. Among them, only the Provincial United Middle School has a high school department. There is an agricultural experimental school in Tangya Town. There are six elementary schools, including the attached elementary school, Chengmei Elementary School, and four county-run elementary schools. The newly established Yingshi University is not far from Jinhua. In addition to the 100,000 yuan allocated by the Ministry of Education as annual expenses, the provincial government also sends educational subsidies of several thousand yuan per month. The number of students has recently exceeded 500.

World Women

### Mao Zedong's Wife, Ms. He Qi

— Shao Chen

On the surface, Mao Zedong's wife, Ms. He Qi, looks like a frail young woman, but in reality, her character is very resolute. Few people have seen her wearing long clothes. For more than ten years, she has always worn a set of Red Army uniforms, with a pistol and bayonet hanging on her belt. She used to fight against the Kuomintang's communist suppression troops on the front lines, transporting wounded soldiers to the rear, nursing patients, and organizing female soldiers. Since she cohabited with Mao Zedong, she has been busy and hardworking all day long for more than ten years. She has given birth to five children, but she has given them all away and doesn't want any of them herself.

When the Kuomintang army was suppressing the communists in Jiangxi, and the Red Army fled from Jiangxi all the way to Shaanxi, walking eight thousand miles, her body suffered more than twenty injuries. During this eight thousand-mile retreat, she endured all kinds of human suffering. After being injured, she first had people carry her, then people carried her on their backs, and then mules and horses carried her. In the end, both people and horses were gone, so she had to walk. At the same time, she gave birth to a child. She was truly a person who had experienced all kinds of suffering.

She is now thirty years old, and her original name was He Jiangchun. In the Red Army, everyone called her "Female Commander." She is from Yunshan, Jiangxi. She attended a church elementary school. After graduating from elementary school, she participated in the women's movement in her county. In 1927, she joined the Communist Party. She married Mao Zedong in 1928. She was very busy in the Red Army. She successively served as a political professor, nurse, and leader of various women's organizations. When there was a war, she was also a soldier. In short, she always had work to do anytime, anywhere.

### The World-Shaking Treasure Island - Cocos Island

— Hu Jiahua

The Origin of His Treasure - Treasures Worth 20 Million Pounds - Have Been Excavated by Americans

A few days ago, the Shanghai Western News published a piece of news saying that the Cocos Island treasure, worth 20 million pounds, has been discovered by a treasure-hunting team from California, USA. Because the place where the treasure is buried is too deep, they are now waiting for large cranes and other application machinery to be transported from the United States before engaging in large-scale excavation.

Cocos Island is a small island in the Pacific Ocean with a circumference of sixteen miles, located five hundred miles south of Panama. The treasure on the island was buried by the famous Pacific pirate Benitio Bonito in 1820. He transported all the gold, silver, and jewelry he had plundered over the years to this small island. After burying it, he killed half of his pirate gang for fear of leaks. However, in the end, due to too few people, his ship was broken by the wind and waves, so he had to sail the ship to Valparaiso, Chile, for repairs, where he was discovered by local officials and captured. All the pirates, except for a young boy named Thompson (because he was robbed by the pirates on a British ship), were sentenced to death.

In 1839, this Thompson, who escaped death, bought a two-masted square-rigged ship called Mary Diez in Lima, Peru. He made himself the shipowner. Coincidentally, a revolution broke out there at that time, and local wealthy merchants, because Thompson's ship was registered in the UK, moved gold and silver jewelry worth 15 million US dollars onto his ship, preparing to sail to a safe place in another country. Who knew that in the middle of the night, Thompson had bad intentions and sailed the ship to Cocos Island again. He divided a small part of the jewelry among the sailors, and buried the remaining eleven small boatloads of loot on the island. However, just as he was leaving the island, this pirate ship was captured by a Peruvian gunboat, and all the sailors on board were sentenced to death, while Thompson was spared because he hid in a stone cave. Later, he was rescued by Keatng, the first mate of the three-masted ship Albatross. He told Keatng this secret. However, not long after, he suddenly left Keatng's house alone while drunk and was buried in the heavy snow. After his death, Keatng bought a sailing ship, took the map drawn on parchment by Thompson, and arrived safely at Cocos Island following the route Thompson had told him. This time Keatng took out jewelry worth 13,000 US dollars. Later, according to himself, because he was afraid that his partners would kill him, he did not dare to take more, and he also told his partners that this excavation was a failure.

After Keatng's death, his widow took the draft left by her husband and bought a sailing ship called Aurora with Fred Hackett, the owner of a famous seal-hunting ship, and organized an excavation team to set off for Cocos Island, but after several months of work, they returned empty-handed.

From 1901 to 1902, Hackett made a second trip to Cocos Island, but the result was also a complete failure.

In the following years, although other excavation teams went to excavate, the result was that none of them failed. The most famous of these was the excavation team of Irishman Howard Grey in 1905, which lasted for two years. The excavation team of Lord Firwilliam of England in 1904, but the result was that he himself and his companions were injured by explosives. The excavation team organized by Captain C.A. Polkinhorne in Vancouver in 1924. The excavation team organized by Sir Malcolm Campbell, the world-famous British express train king, in 1925.

Because of several failures, some people said that the treasure of Cocos Island had already been taken away. Others said that because of the long years, the location where it was buried may have sunk into the sea. But recent news has come that this rare treasure has actually reappeared in the world. Although it has not yet been fully excavated, when the detailed report of its complete success is transmitted in the future, it will definitely cause a sensation.

### Small Records of Knowledge

The flowers on the cacti in the United States are the most fragrant flowers in the world, and people can smell the fragrance of a flower half a mile away.

It takes eight tons of roses to make one pound of rose oil.

Although there is no definite evidence, everyone knows that many birds have extremely sensitive hearing, especially owls, whose hearing seems to be stronger than that of humans!

The Soviet Union has a car that can carry 322 people.

In 1919, Palestine had a population of only 700,000. Now, it has 1.4 million. Why has their population increased so quickly? The immigration of Jews is certainly one of the reasons, but the biggest reason is that the fertility rate of Arabs is the highest in the world.
