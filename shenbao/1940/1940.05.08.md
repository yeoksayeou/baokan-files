### The Hua Army of Southern Henan Launches a Full-Scale Offensive, Completing the Encirclement of the Japanese Forces. Defeats Japanese Main Force in the Mi-Que and Tong-Xin Highway Area. Fierce Battles Along the Jing-Zhong Line in Central Hubei, with the Chinese Army Completing Annihilation Efforts.

Nanyang: The Hua Army of Southern Henan, adapting to the battlefield situation and according to plan, launched a full-scale offensive on the morning of the 6th, in the area along the Mi-Que and Tong-Xin highways, encircling the main force of the advancing Japanese army. The details are as follows: From May 1st, the Hua Army, facing the Japanese advancing from the Yang Branch Road, followed the predetermined strategy, deploying a portion of their forces in the front to strike the Japanese in successive waves. After fierce fighting on the night of the 6th, the main force of the Japanese army was completely drawn into the Mi-Yang and Tong-Bai lines on the Hua front, preventing them from escaping. Simultaneously, the main force of the Hua Army gradually moved towards the outer flanks of the Japanese, completing the encirclement. Another unit, under a certain command, advanced along multiple routes towards the rear of the Japanese on the Ping-Han Railway, directly attacking the Japanese base and cutting off their retreat. By the night of the 6th, the intended encirclement had been completed. On the morning of the 7th, the encirclement and attack began. The Hua Army's deployment was thorough, and morale was high. The large army on the northern side of the Mi-Que Highway launched a fierce attack to the south, cutting off the Japanese forces on the Mi-Que road in successive waves. Simultaneously, the large armies on both sides of the Hua Tong-Xin Road, in coordination with the southward-moving forces, suddenly launched a fierce attack on the left flank and rear of the Japanese. By the afternoon of the 7th, the Japanese forces on the Tong-Xin Road were immediately shaken. Furthermore, at noon on the 6th, the Hua Army on the front suddenly launched a fierce attack on the advancing Japanese, engaging in fierce battles in the vicinity of Mi-Yang and Tong-Bai. The Japanese, caught off guard by the sudden attack, were defeated after only three hours of fighting, leaving behind over 1,400 bodies. The remaining Japanese forces fled north in disarray. The Hua Army is pursuing them relentlessly, expanding the victory in coordination with the large armies on the two flanks. The Hua Army behind the Ping-Han Railway launched a counter-offensive operation around Xinyang and Minggang last night, achieving great success. In summary, the major battle in the Southern Henan region has, to date, resulted in the deaths of 5,300 Japanese soldiers, and even more astonishing developments are expected. (Dated 7th)

Editorial

### The Significance of Abolishing the May Ninth Commemoration

Yesterday was May Seventh, tomorrow is May Ninth. Twenty years ago, Japan demanded Twenty-One Demands from China, delivering them to the ailing Medun on May Seventh and requiring a formal response by May Ninth. This is a historical fact that every Chinese person can remember. May Ninth became a national day of shame, first by social initiative and then by government decree. However, we believe that the New Order in East Asia is more cruel than the Twenty-One Demands, that armed invasion is more cruel than the ailing Medun, and that the War of Resistance is a reversal of history. Therefore, after the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the concept of the so-called National Shame of May Ninth naturally changed. This newspaper commented on and concluded last year's May Ninth as follows:

"...The so-called New Order in East Asia is actually a continuation and expansion of the Twenty-One Demands. The historical and bloody lessons of Japan's invasion of China over the past twenty-four years have finally awakened the 450 million people of China. Today, China's War of Resistance is a positive response to the Twenty-One Demands made on May Seventh, replacing the May Ninth commemoration. In other words, in the past, Chinese society commemorated May Ninth with resentment and tears. Now, Chinese soldiers and civilians are using heroic sacrifices and iron blood to cancel May Ninth."

This is a simple view, but it can be confidently considered accurate. According to a recent report from the United Press in Chongqing, it is briefly stated:

"The government today decided to abolish the National Shame Commemoration Day of May Ninth. The original purpose of the May Ninth commemoration was to remind the public of the Japanese's ambitions to invade China. Now, since July 7, 1937, the entire country has been at war, and July 7 has been designated as the War of Resistance Commemoration Day. Therefore, the commemoration of May Ninth is no longer necessary."

What deserves further discussion is that any national holiday of any nation must have its solemn and profound significance. On every holiday, it is necessary to understand its meaning, be respectful, and hold grand ceremonies. China has been at a critical juncture of survival and continuation, with complex and intricate situations in recent years, so there are particularly many holidays compared to other nations and eras. It is necessary to make prudent revisions after the overall situation is stable. However, the decision to abolish the National Shame Commemoration Day of May Ninth is because the country is at war and the May Ninth incident is a part of the War of Resistance. There is no need to commemorate this incident separately, so the decision has been made as soon as possible.

Although this decision by the Chinese government to abolish the National Shame Commemoration Day of May Ninth seems to be consistent with our simple view, it is still necessary to further explore its underlying motives. From a negative perspective, this decision is not only about the existence or abolition of a legal holiday or simply a government order within an administrative scope. In its meaning, it is certainly not that we define May Ninth as a national shame, nor that future generations should be without shame. It would be even more absurd to misinterpret this as eliminating misunderstandings and abandoning hatred, because although the Chinese national character is benevolent and moderate, and although resolving grievances is generally considered a virtue and a traditional education, the current era is one of shared hatred and a clear emphasis on teaching about shame and fighting the enemy. Unless the invading country repents and changes its course, ceases hostilities and withdraws its troops, and China fulfills its inherent desire for sovereignty and territorial integrity, there is no basis for discussing the abandonment or elimination of misunderstandings and hatred. One might ask, in the midst of the War of Resistance, there can never be enough ways and opportunities to promote morale and inspire the people. Given the wealth of information provided by May Ninth, why not simply continue to preserve this commemoration day, which is the best way and opportunity to promote and inspire? Why bother with this abolition? Indeed, this question is reasonable. We must seek the positive motives behind this decision.

Regarding the Sino-Japanese issue, there have been various sophistries and self-deceptions from the beginning in Japan and on the Japanese side. These have become particularly prevalent recently. To name a few notable examples: Some say that Japan invaded China because the Chinese people not only failed to understand Japan's benevolent rule but also opposed Japan, which angered Japan, forcing it to use its military might to punish China. Others say that the Chinese people did not want to resist Japan and had no need to resist Japan, but were held hostage by certain international forces, which led to their resistance against Japan, forcing Japan to clear away the resisters on behalf of the Chinese people. Still others say that Japan has not invaded China, or at least will no longer invade China in the future, but China has been accusing Japan of aggression, so they should no longer accuse them and should seek peace. Such arguments have become a harmonious justification. Of course, anyone who appeals to reason and conscience can judge the fallacy and absurdity of these arguments without needing to refute them word by word. However, it is worthwhile to briefly analyze these arguments: They have dissected history and obscured facts. In the stage where violence is on the rise, they use these distorted arguments to embellish the invasion. In the stage where violence is declining, they use these distorted arguments to conceal the invasion. We only need to review the Twenty-One Demands that Japan enclosed in the Medun on May Seventh twenty-five years ago, and continue to review everything Japan has done in the military, political, economic, and diplomatic fields in recent years and even recently. First, we can see that Japan's aggression has been a consistent ambition from the past to the present. Second, we can see that China's opposition and resistance against Japan have been forced by Japan from beginning to end. Third, we can see that May Ninth is only an intermediate event, just as the Chinese army's recapture of Wuyuan and counterattack on Nanchang are only intermediate events. If we allow the dissection of history and the obscuring of facts, and treat an event as a single event, then the Japanese side's distorted arguments can be established, and they can even accuse China of seizing Wuyuan and invading Nanchang! However, history cannot be dissected, and facts cannot be obscured. Therefore, distorted arguments only expose themselves as distortions. The Chinese government's decision to abolish the National Shame Commemoration Day of May Ninth is to declare that Japan's Medun twenty-five years ago and China's full-scale War of Resistance today are all part of the same issue. Historical facts are ironclad evidence, and they do not allow for various sophistries or various self-deceptions!

### Chamberlain's Detailed Report in the British House of Commons on the Norwegian War Situation; Explains the Reasons for Military Delay in Norway; International Reaction Not as Severe as Initially Expected

London, [Date]: Today, Prime Minister Chamberlain addressed the House of Commons on the Norwegian war situation. He stated that last Thursday, he had only been able to give an incomplete account of the war situation and would continue to report this week, hoping to provide a detailed report at that time. He also stated that he had to maintain considerable silence to avoid revealing anything that could endanger our forces. Since then, all members have known that our forces have retreated from Åndalsnes and must continue to retreat from Namsos. He was extremely unwilling to make any hints about this military operation, which was even more dangerous than the retreat from Åndalsnes. This military withdrawal involved a larger number of people, and there was the possibility of German bombers arriving at any time.

The Prime Minister praised the British Army for completing the withdrawal mission in a short period of time without suffering any losses (cheers). He said that the next morning, the Germans discovered that the British forces were returning to the ships and sent fifty bombers to obstruct them, which also proved the danger faced by the British forces. This transport was beyond the range of our fighter planes, so all the anti-aircraft guns on the ships had to defend themselves. Fortunately, we only lost the British destroyer HMS Afridi and the French destroyer Bison, which is fortunate. Now, the troops from Namsos and Åndalsnes have returned, and the war in southern Norway has ended. The troops carried out their mission with extraordinary bravery (cheers), which has further enhanced the traditional honor of the British Army. Their hard fighting, perseverance, and agile and alert actions, under the pressure of superior enemy forces and superior equipment, have shown that they are superior to the enemy in terms of their treatment of people. He also had to say a word to admire the Royal Navy and Air Force, who continuously carried out difficult and dangerous tasks with great success.

Little Loss in the Withdrawal from Southern Norway

He did not intend to describe the course of the war in southern Norway, but wished to explain the truth of the war situation and consider the discussions caused by the government's actions. The news of our military withdrawal undoubtedly caused deep shock in this House and across the country (someone shouted "overseas and worldwide"). Everything done by the cabinet members will inevitably be criticized, but news from the Swedish capital, or fabricated by the enemy, has aroused some things that are expected to happen. This has neither proper reason nor has it been agreed to by any cabinet member.

When the Prime Minister spoke to this point, he was interrupted by opposition party members, who were strictly stopped by the Speaker. The Prime Minister was able to continue to state that although the government has tried its best to suppress such unfounded rumors, it must also be cautious on the one hand and not publish any remarks that would provide the enemy with truthful information. He was deeply afraid that under these circumstances, shocks and disappointments were inevitable. He will now review the history and causes of this failure and answer many questions. He certainly did not want to make any decorations, but at the same time hoped that we would not exaggerate the impact or military importance of the setbacks we have suffered. The withdrawal from southern Norway cannot be compared with the retreat from Gallipoli in those years. There were no large troops involved. In fact, the number was only slightly more than one division, so our losses were not great, and no large quantities of military supplies were left behind. The Prime Minister also emphasized that if we had losses, the losses of German warships, aircraft, transport ships, and soldiers were far greater than ours (cheers). Nevertheless, he still knew that the end of the recent events could not be measured solely in terms of local losses (the whole house shouted to listen carefully). We must consider the fact that prestige has been considerably damaged, making the false legend of the Germans being invincible on land even more vivid, causing allied nations to be discouraged, and the enemy to be greatly pleased. We must accept this situation at present, but we do not need to help the enemy make it worse.

Foreign Reactions Not Seen as Serious

Regarding the reactions of various foreign countries, he felt that they were not as serious as expected. France has always shown remarkable composure during this difficult period (cheers), and the situation is the same as in this country. The only impact of the setback is to strengthen its determination. Our allied nation, Turkey, also continued without any disturbance, and Egypt continued to strengthen its defenses. The situation in the Near East has gradually calmed down due to the restoration of the normal state of our fleet's dominance in the Mediterranean. You must have expected the reaction from Sweden to be more serious than anywhere else. He deeply understood the reason for this. He regretted that the Swedish newspapers carried controversial comments, and Sweden's expression of disappointment may be natural, but such comments neither benefit Sweden nor are beneficial to the righteousness of the Allied countries. What we are concerned about now is not to argue back, this is good in every way (shouting "listen, listen"), but the general plan to be taken in the future. If the Swedish government and people decide to take a neutral policy under pressure, then he must trust that this neutrality will at least be strictly fair to both belligerent parties (listen, listen).

The Aid to Norway Was Out of Risk

The Prime Minister then described the subsequent events and the various decisions of the cabinet, saying that when we decided to send troops to Narvik, he had not heard any criticism. The area is a gateway for Sweden's precious iron ore mines to reach the North Sea. He dared to predict that this decision would be approved by the public. But some may want to ask whether we already knew that the enemy troops in Trondheim had an advantage in the sky, and that the enemy troops in Oslo could rush there quickly, why still send an expeditionary force to that area. He did not want to pretend that in the first few days of the crisis, we had anticipated everything, but we certainly knew that the departure of the expeditionary force was full of danger. We also knew that if we could not contain the enemy's reinforcements, it would be very difficult to seize Trondheim and hold it. We also knew that the convenience of the Trondheim airfield, without repair and expansion, was not sufficient for the activities of our aircraft. But we also had to consider the impact on the Norwegian government, troops, and people if we did not attempt to occupy central Norway. We had received repeated and urgent calls from the commander-in-chief of the Norwegian army, saying that he would attack Trondheim at any cost. We were then clear that if we did not attack Trondheim, the Norwegians would feel that they could not continue to resist, and the whole country would fall into the hands of the Germans. In this situation, we felt that although the matter was difficult and dangerous, we had to risk helping the brave nation, who had almost forgotten what war was, to bravely rise up and resist the German army in the hope of preserving their freedom and independence. He asked, if the gentlemen of this House were in our position, would they not have acted in the same way? He felt that if we had refused Norway's call, we would have been blamed for only caring about the iron ore in Scandinavia and not caring about the freedom of small countries. We would have been unable to defend ourselves against this.

Failure to Destroy Highways Considered a Mistake

He will now state the reason why we had to make a direct attack on Trondheim. Experts may have different opinions on this point. Although there will be valuable military opinions, it will never be possible to make a final decision without testing the war. Since we decided to advocate, we carefully considered and formulated a plan for a direct attack on Trondheim and simultaneous operations in Namsos and Åndalsnes. This battle was naturally complicated, and a long time was needed to prepare thoroughly to ensure victory. Furthermore, at a certain time, it seemed that the occupation of Trondheim could only be achieved by troops landing in various places. We often thought that the highway from Oslo to the two river basins had been destroyed by the Norwegians, and the bridges had been blown up, which would delay the German army's advance, but this was very disappointing to us, because except for the two bridges blown up by the British troops, they were never destroyed. As a result, the German army was able to advance rapidly with tanks, artillery, and mortars to contain our army and then force it to retreat.

The Germans in Norway Schemed and Succeeded

He will now touch on the criticisms widely spread outside and in many newspapers, that the troops previously mobilized to help Finland should not have been dispersed. If they had been retained for a longer period of time, we could have preempted and occupied Norwegian ports, or at least more troops could have arrived in the theater of war more quickly. It must be known that even if we could have dispatched troops, we would not have been able to take any action before the German army without the permission of the Norwegian government. It has been said that we should have invaded Norway before the German army. He dared to predict that no one would have thought that was right. Unfortunately, the Norwegian government firmly maintained strict neutrality. The Norwegian government did not allow our troops to enter its ports until it had no choice. Therefore, we were unable to prevent the German attack. They easily succeeded by taking advantage of the schemers within Norway and had been preparing for a long time in advance. Their troops and war materials were obviously hidden in disguised merchant ships. If the argument is insisted that by dispersing the British and French Allied forces, we lost the opportunity to achieve victory after the German army attacked, then he dared to say that this argument is based entirely on fantasy.

The Deployment of the British and French Expeditionary Forces

The Prime Minister continued to explain the truth of the matter, saying that the troops formed into the British and French expeditionary forces were divided into two parts. One part was the advance unit, which was originally intended to be sent to Finland. The other part, which was larger in number, was intended to continue to be dispatched after the first batch arrived in Scandinavia. This second batch was the main force. When the war in Finland ended, we decided that there was no need to keep this large army stationed in the country, so we immediately transferred the main force to France, and kept the advance unit stationed here. The House must know that because there were no troops to transfer within the country, a larger army could not be transferred to Norway. Only by departing quickly could they land in the very few seaports available to us. Therefore, the members will be able to clearly understand that under this arrangement, after the first batch of advance units gained a foothold in Norway, the troops dispatched from France would naturally follow them without delay. In fact, although this main force was far away in France, it would not be delayed in any way as long as it could gain a foothold. Therefore, the dispersal of this part of the British and French Allied forces did not lose time, because in any case, this army would not have left with the advance unit. If the advance unit gained a foothold, then this army could follow as quickly as possible (Reuters, 7th). (To be continued)

### British and French Cabinets Shaken; Lessons Learned from the Norwegian War; Appeasement Will Mislead the Country

London, [Date]: Both the Upper and Lower Houses are scheduled to meet today to debate the government's policy in the Norwegian war. Observers attach great importance to this debate. It is said that Foreign Secretary Halifax is highly respected and is particularly loved by the members in the Upper House. Even the members of the opposition Labour Party have never attacked him. Therefore, if Chamberlain resigns one day, Halifax is the most likely successor to the Prime Minister. Although this gentleman is a lord, according to the constitution, if both the Upper and Lower Houses do not express objections, he can still attend the Lower House to participate in debates after he takes office as Prime Minister one day. In short, even if no vote is held in the Upper House today and the government's position is not shaken, the domestic political tendencies can be seen from the debate today, as the general public is eager for the war to enter a new stage (Havas, 7th).

London, [Date]: According to several newspapers this morning regarding the debate in the House of Commons today, the lesson learned from the Norwegian war is that the Allied countries have failed to recognize the enemy's formidable strength, and that incomplete measures will not enable them to achieve victory. The "Daily Telegraph" reported that when Prime Minister Chamberlain rises to speak in the House of Commons today, he will be aware that the issue now in danger far exceeds the scope of the subject of his speech. From a strict military standpoint, the failure in Norway is not enough to endanger our final victory. Its true significance lies in its relationship with energy, foresight, and efficiency, because the conduct of war depends on these elements. We are clearly aware that we are now truly gathering strength for a final decisive attack. What is more important is that we must be able to break the doubts of the outside world, because the attitude of various neutral countries, which are of great importance to foreign diplomacy, is largely based on our strength and future. Our moral aspect is secondary. The world, which is eagerly awaiting, will study the national reaction to the government's handling of the situation, and its thoroughness will not be different from the event itself. The "Daily Mail" said that today's debate will be very broad, and the people all want to know how to defeat Germany. The current government must have urgent initiatives. The "News Chronicle" also reported that we have only been waging half a war so far, because we are fighting with surplus time and surplus resources. Now we must end this dangerous and foolish action and begin to wage a total war. The "Daily Herald" expressed regret as to whether Chamberlain is suitable to rule (Reuters, 7th).

Paris, [Date]: The people and official circles here are eagerly awaiting the results of today's debate in the British House of Commons. It is expected that there will be repercussions on the position of the French government. "L'Intransigeant" reported, "Prime Minister Chamberlain has deep roots in the Munich concept. May I ask, will Mr. Reynaud easily abandon it? " "L'Ordre" reported that Chamberlain should know that appeasement and misleading the country are one and the same. The German government had already quickly learned that the Allied countries' decision on Norway was a reality (Reuters, 7th).

### Italy's Newly Built Main Warship Enters the Fleet; Weighs 35,000 Tons; Equipped with Large-Caliber Cannons

Milan, [Date]: Italy's newly built main warship, "Littorio," was incorporated into the fleet yesterday. The ship weighs 35,000 tons. It underwent a launching ceremony on August 22, 1937, after being inspected by Italian Admiral Farina. "Littorio" and "Vittorio Veneto" are known as sister ships. The ship has a speed of 30 knots. The ship is equipped with 38.1 cm caliber cannons, twelve 15.1 cm caliber howitzers, and twelve 9 cm caliber anti-aircraft guns, 40 machine guns, and three sloops. Italy now has a total of six warships in the fleet (Haitong News Agency, 7th).

### Tensions Rise in the Mediterranean; US and the Vatican Attempt to Avert Disaster; Try to Prevent Italy from Joining the War; Britain Denies Asking Italy to Clarify Its Position; Return of Loraine, Hope for Peace Not Yet Lost

Rome, [Date]: After Crown Prince Umberto of Italy met with the Pope, Prime Minister Mussolini was received at the Palazzo Venezia yesterday. Prime Minister Mussolini also met with the two army commanders for more than an hour to discuss Italy's war preparations. Authoritative sources here revealed last night that when the Pope received Crown Prince Umberto and the Princess yesterday morning, he mentioned President Roosevelt's efforts for peace. The Pope also expressed his hope that Italy would be spared from participating in the war. Vatican authoritative circles said that when Roosevelt's special envoy to the Vatican, Mr. Taylor, secretly visited the Pope on Saturday, the Pope reportedly agreed to work with President Roosevelt to promote peace and prevent Italy from joining the war. This news was transmitted by church sources. It is said that the US Ambassador to Rome, Mr. Phillips, and President Roosevelt's special envoy to the Vatican, Mr. Taylor, spent time in Florence together, which is related to this matter. Mr. Phillips will return to Rome today to hold important talks with Italian government leaders, including the Prime Minister. Last night, British Ambassador Loraine returned to Rome. People from all walks of life believe that this is another role in the international peace situation. It is believed that Sir Loraine will meet with Prime Minister Mussolini in the next few days, or it may happen today. At that time, the British Ambassador will have the opportunity to explain to Prime Minister Mussolini the British view on the Allied Navy's increased defense in the Mediterranean. In addition, after the Pope received Crown Prince Umberto and the Princess, he also received the French Ambassador to the Vatican, Mr. Roche. After this news was released, it was believed that France will also participate in the Vatican and the United States' efforts to quell the war. Some Vatican officials even believe that these efforts will turn hostility into friendship. The Italian government is rapidly preparing for war (United Press, 7th).

Vatican City, [Date]: It is rumored that Pope Pius XII gave a plan regarding the Mediterranean situation to President Roosevelt's personal representative to the Vatican, Mr. Taylor. Officials here recently denied this, saying that the Vatican will do its part to ensure that all efforts will end the war as soon as possible, but it has never put forward any specific suggestions (Havas, 6th).

Rome, [Date]: Diplomatic circles learned last night that Britain has sent a note to Italy, requesting clarification of Italy's true position in the European war, and expressed a strong hope to receive a reply before May 16. The reports of Britain's increased defense in the Mediterranean are said to be related to this request. It is believed that this document was submitted by British Chargé d'affaires Charles, on the same day that US Ambassador to Rome, Mr. Phillips, met with Prime Minister Mussolini. It is understood that this note directly questions whether Italy is neutral or participating in the war. It is believed that Britain is dissatisfied with Italy's current non-belligerent status. However, the British Embassy denies having heard of this news (United Press, 7th).

London, [Date]: According to various newspapers, Britain will ask Italy to explain its position on the current situation. This statement has been firmly denied by British officials (Havas, 7th).

London, [Date]: It is rumored that the Italian government has raised several questions with the British government regarding the measures taken by Britain in the Mediterranean, requesting clarification of the reasons. This statement has not been confirmed, but according to well-informed sources, Italian Foreign Minister Ciano did raise several questions requesting explanation when he spoke with British Chargé d'affaires Charles last week (Havas, 6th).

Rome, [Date]: British Ambassador to Italy, Sir Loraine, returned here from London last night. US Ambassador to Italy, Mr. Phillips, recently visited northern Italy for several days and has now returned to Rome (Haitong News Agency, 7th).

London, [Date]: Reuters learned today that when British Ambassador to Italy, Loraine, returns to his post in Rome, he will visit Italian Foreign Minister Ciano as a matter of courtesy. This is almost certain, so this matter has no special relationship. A Reuters diplomatic reporter learned that British economic expert Mr. Perry has returned to Rome. It is said that this trip is purely related to the settlement agreement and is not related to any broader commercial purpose (Reuters, 7th).

Moscow, [Date]: The Commercial Newspaper "Trud" published an article yesterday, saying that Italy has taken a stance of participating in the war, hoping to control the Mediterranean, but is now waiting for a suitable opportunity. Italy's current war preparations are actually intended to intimidate the Allied countries and attempt to prevent the Allied countries from invading the Balkans. "Once the neutrality of the Balkans is broken, it will immediately result in Italian intervention. ...... Italy's intimidation may affect the Allied countries' plan to create a new war situation in the Balkans. However, if the Allied countries' plan can be realized, then Italy will join the war (United Press, 7th).

### Rumor of Telephone Conversation Between British and French Leaders; Discussing the Mediterranean Situation; Both Britain and France Deny

Berlin, [Date]: The German News Agency recently issued the following report, revealing the content of a telephone conversation between the British and French prime ministers. It is said that French Prime Minister Reynaud spoke with British Prime Minister Chamberlain at 10:10 pm on April 30 (Western European time). After discussing economic issues, Reynaud told Chamberlain, "General Weygand has fully prepared for the actions that both sides agreed on May 15, but said that Chamberlain cannot absolutely insist on the date, because such actions may have to be launched slightly later." Chamberlain seemed unhappy when he heard this and replied, "I have the impression that the people there think that time is absolutely necessary." Reynaud said, "There are still various difficulties that must be resolved with Turkey before action can be taken." Chamberlain then urged him to talk to Turkey again. Reynaud then said that he would try his best to remove "spiritual difficulties." Chamberlain then sternly demanded that Reynaud notify Britain of the preparations by May 20. After the two sides exchanged pleasantries, the telephone conversation ended at 10:25 pm (Haitong News Agency, 7th).

Paris, [Date]: German newspapers all carried news that British Prime Minister Chamberlain had a telephone conversation with French Prime Minister Reynaud on April 30 from 10:10 pm to 10:25 pm to discuss the actions that the two countries should take in the Mediterranean. The French government recently issued a communique denying this, saying that the British and French prime ministers never had such a conversation, and that the German propaganda trick is not worth mentioning (Havas, 7th).

London, [Date]: Regarding the rumors from the German side that Prime Minister Chamberlain of the British Prime Minister had a telephone conversation with French Prime Minister Reynaud on April 30, British officials, following the French authorities, firmly denied this, saying that the Prime Minister had fully exchanged views with Prime Minister Reynaud at the British-French Supreme Military Joint Conference on April 28 and that there was no need to do so again (Havas, 7th).

### Fires of War Spread Across Southeastern Europe: Public in Panic and Uneasy; Rumors of German Troops Massing on Hungarian Border Awaiting Orders; Southern Nations Augmenting Military Preparations, Maintaining Vigilance; Berlin Intensifies Psychological Warfare

Basel, Switzerland - A Berlin correspondent for the *Basler Nachrichten* recently wired that Germany is again engaging in "psychological warfare," claiming it will launch an offensive on the Western Front. However, the country is accustomed to using misdirection, and it typically makes such pronouncements before taking action elsewhere. In recent days, this tactic has become even more pronounced, particularly with the fabrication of a long-distance phone call between British Prime Minister Chamberlain and French Premier Reynaud. It is believed that the intention is to create an atmosphere of disorder and unease. Notably, German propaganda has made no mention of Hungary, maintains a rather reserved attitude towards Romania, and considers Bulgaria the focal point of the European crisis, even more so than Yugoslavia and Greece. All these points are worthy of attention. (Havas, 7th)

Berlin - The main issue discussed in German newspapers today remains the rapid advance of German forces in Norway and the Anglo-French conspiracies in the Balkans. The *Berliner Börsen-Zeitung* prominently published the content of Chamberlain and Reynaud's telephone conversation (April 30th), arguing that it demonstrated the aggressive intentions of Britain and France. The premiers' talk only confirmed the military preparations of Britain and France in the Mediterranean and their intention to stir up trouble in the region. The newspaper concluded that all preparations must be completed by May 20th at the latest, at which point southeastern Europe may be engulfed in flames. (Haitong, 7th)

London - The Information Ministry stated that in the past 36 hours, German radio and news agencies have spread absurd rumors about border disputes erupting in the Balkan Peninsula. These rumors are largely contradictory, and others, originating from Berlin, were denied by Berlin itself within only one or two hours. The German purpose is clear: to disseminate false information to create an atmosphere of unease that benefits German objectives. (Reuters, 7th)

London - According to reliable sources, German troops are concentrating on the Hungarian border. Simultaneously, rumors are circulating that relations between Hungary and the Slovak state have once again become strained. Political figures here believe that Germany is about to intervene in Hungary, hoping to expand the war to the Balkan Peninsula, thereby forcing Italy to take a clearer stance. Furthermore, according to some reports, the Hlinka Guard of the Slovak People's Party has repeatedly staged demonstrations in recent weeks, following orders from the German authorities, demanding that Hungary return the land obtained under the Vienna Arbitration Award to the Slovak state. The Hungarian government is quite uneasy. In short, Hungary is in a perilous situation and may no longer be able to rely on Italy as a protector. (Havas, 6th)

Yugoslavia - German "tourists" have been arriving in Yugoslavia in a steady stream recently. Some districts have even had branch leaders of the Nazi Party assigned to them. Foreign observers here believe that Yugoslavia is likely to become the next Norway. However, unlike Norway, Yugoslavia is well-prepared militarily. The government and people of the city-state are deeply aware of the impending crisis, and therefore have been swift in preparing and maintaining vigilance. Regarding the Yugoslav army, a prominent American journalist even called it "one of the most elite armies in Europe." Germany must take this into consideration. Germany's primary goal is to exploit the 500,000 ethnic Germans within Yugoslavia to launch an offensive from within. Therefore, German political police have infiltrated Yugoslavia to secretly instruct these minorities. Under these circumstances, if Italy attempts to occupy the western coast of Yugoslavia via the Adriatic Sea, Germany will definitely send troops to invade the Croatian region of Yugoslavia. It is worth noting that Yugoslavia has made preparations, and Germany's plans may not easily succeed. (Havas, 6th)

Rome - The *Il Popolo d'Italia* reported last night that Turkey has amassed a large army on the Greek border, causing unrest in Bulgaria. The newspaper claimed that the concentration of Turkish troops may be related to the British naval activity in the eastern Mediterranean. (United Press, 7th)

Sofia, Bulgaria - Foreign observers here said that the German semi-official news agency, Deutsches Nachrichtenbüro, issued a report claiming that Turkey had concentrated troops on the Greek border. Diplomatic authorities in concerned countries have denied this. Germany's strategy is to spread alarming rumors to cause panic and unrest among the neutral small countries of southeastern Europe. However, this strategy has undoubtedly failed in Bulgaria, as relations between Turkey and Bulgaria are extremely friendly and are becoming increasingly close in an atmosphere of mutual trust. The reported troop movements are completely inaccurate. (Havas, 6th)

### Germany Offers Assurances, Respects Swedish Neutrality; Swedish Army Chief Speaks on Radio, Vows to Fight for Independence and Freedom

Stockholm - Swedish Foreign Minister Günther recently stated that King Gustav V has exchanged letters with Hitler regarding the political situation. Sweden has repeatedly affirmed its neutrality, and Germany has given assurances of respecting Swedish neutrality. (Reuters, 7th)

Berlin - The official German news agency announced that German leader Hitler and Swedish King Gustav exchanged written opinions on the political situation in the latter half of April. This action has strengthened the complete alignment of future policies between the two countries, in accordance with the statements already announced by the German and Swedish governments. (Reuters, 7th)

Stockholm - General Ericsson, Commander-in-Chief of the Swedish Army, recently delivered a radio address, stating, "If we are forced by circumstances to resort to war, we will not hesitate to fight. Even though war may bring losses, if we continue to enjoy freedom, we will surely be able to quickly recover. Conversely, if we lose our freedom under foreign guardianship, what value will life and property have? We have recently understood that the interests of the nation are our interests. The nation can guarantee our security, but when necessary, it may require us to accept sacrifices, even sacrificing our lives. In this, we must be brave and unyielding to protect our country's freedom and independence." (Havas, 6th)

### Turkish Parliament Passes Bill, Grants Broader Powers to Military Authorities

Istanbul - An Anqara dispatch states that the Turkish Parliament today passed ten bills, stipulating that in extraordinary circumstances, military authorities are granted broader powers, including requisitioning public and private property and services. (Reuters, 7th)

### Netherlands on Alert, Officers' Leave Canceled

The Hague - The Government Information Service recently issued a communiqué stating that all leave, regular or temporary, has been canceled for officers and soldiers of the army, navy, and air force, as well as employees of war industries. (Havas, 7th)

### Polish Destroyer Sunk in Norwegian Waters; Britain Compensates with Newly Built Warship; Stavanger Airport Bombed Again

London - According to an official announcement, the Polish destroyer "Grom," which has been working closely with the British fleet since the start of the war, was recently sunk by bombs while operating in the Norwegian Sea. One officer and 65 soldiers are missing and presumed dead. The British government is willing to compensate for the "Grom" with a new warship currently under construction, and the Polish government has accepted this offer. (Reuters, 7th)

London - The Polish destroyer "Grom" had a displacement of 2,144 tons, a speed of 3 knots per hour, and was equipped with four 4.7-inch guns, four anti-aircraft guns, and mine-laying equipment. The entire crew consisted of 80 officers and soldiers. At the beginning of the European war, it and other Polish warships joined the British fleet, under the command of the British naval authorities. (Havas, 6th)

London - It has now been learned that Captain Wynne, commander of the British destroyer "HMS Havant," which was bombed and sunk by German aircraft while escorting troop transports in Norwegian territorial waters, has been rescued and is safe. The ship's survivors departed from a port in Scotland last night, heading south. (Reuters, 7th)

Paris - The Ministry of the Navy recently announced that a British and French convoy, escorted by our warships, was attacked by German aircraft in the North Sea on the 3rd of this month. German aircraft dropped multiple bombs, but none hit the transport ships. Only our destroyer "Bison" was sunk, but most of the sailors have been rescued. (Havas, 6th)

London - It is now known that a squadron of British bombers, led by Squadron Leader Thorold, bombed the Stavanger airfield in Norway yesterday, temporarily rendering it ineffective. Enemy anti-aircraft guns and fighter planes put up strong resistance. All but two of the British planes returned to base. It is reported that the two missing planes were last seen after the squadron reached its target, spread out, and dropped bombs individually. (Reuters, 7th)

### Estimated Losses of German Merchant Ships Reach Approximately 600,000 Tons Since Outbreak of War

London - The Admiralty announced that since April 1st, the Germans have lost a total of 300,000 tons of merchant ships, most of which were sunk during the Norwegian campaign. This does not include transport ships and supply ships. The above figure brings Germany's losses since the start of the war to 600,000 tons, accounting for 15% of Germany's pre-war total tonnage. Confirmed captures, sinkings, or self-scuttling of German merchant ships total 454,000 tons. It is estimated that there are another 30 unidentified ships, totaling 150,000 tons, that have been sunk by Allied submarines, mines, and aircraft. According to reports from Rotterdam, the German motor vessel "Robert Ley" (27,288 tons) sank in the Skagerrak on the evening of April 12th. There are also reports of two German ships sinking near Delfzijl. In the week ending late on April 28th, German actions resulted in the sinking of four British ships totaling 6,689 tons, one Allied ship of 1,458 tons, and two neutral ships totaling 298 tons. The names of the above ships are not to be released under the new regulations. British losses in tonnage are less than one-third of the average weekly losses to date. The convoy system continues to be successful. As of May 1st, a total of 19,098 British, Allied, and neutral ships had been convoyed, with 31 being sunk. Meanwhile, 3,457 ships were convoyed by the French, with 7 being sunk. Although the Germans have heavily bombed our ships in Norwegian territorial waters, our ships have put up extremely strong defenses. One ship was attacked more than forty times in a single day, with German aircraft dropping 150 bombs, none of which hit. There were no casualties on board. The ship's anti-aircraft guns shot down two enemy aircraft and damaged four others. Another warship escorting troop transports shot down five enemy aircraft in three days. As far as is known, there are currently no German ships in Narvik or Norwegian territorial waters north of there. (Reuters, 7th)

### US Focuses on Far East, Pacific Fleet to Remain; Public and Government Sympathize with China, Condemn Illegal Aggression; Broad Embargo Against Japan Under Discussion in Congress

Washington - Naval experts here declared yesterday that although the European war is raging, the United States is still focusing its attention on the Far East. This spring's large-scale maneuvers by the US fleet in the Pacific demonstrate America's concern for the Far East more clearly than any official statement. After the exercises, the US fleet will remain indefinitely in several locations in the Pacific. Because the Latin and British countries neighboring the Pacific mutually abolish armaments based on friendly relations, the only meaning of the US fleet concentrating in the Pacific is to prevent difficulties in the Far East. The fact that the US Navy does not prepare for defense on the American Atlantic coast shows America's bias towards Asia. This defense surprises the Europeans, who are fighting each other to the death, but this fact can be explained by a part of the general American belief. America's views on Europe: first, it recognizes that the powers of Europe are roughly equal to each other, and no country seems to threaten American security; second, the legendary West (the West refers to Asia) is the border of the United States and where American commercial interests lie; third, in the Far East, Japan's naval and military forces are very powerful, while China and the Soviet Union may experience disturbances, and their preparations are relatively limited. In comparison, the forces are quite uneven, and any incident is likely to occur; fourth, the United States has territories on the islands in the Pacific, which must be guaranteed security. The relationship between the United States and any Far Eastern country is based on the hope of stabilizing the status quo in the Pacific and expanding trade. The official and non-official sympathy of the United States towards China stems from the American belief that China, which is moving towards a modern national economy and modern politics, should be allowed to develop itself and should not be interfered with by other countries. Therefore, in the past, the United States opposed Russia's aggression against China, and now, it at least diplomatically resists Japan's aggression against China. The basic requirement of the US policy towards China is the Nine-Power Treaty of 1922. This provision stipulates that any country should respect the territorial and administrative integrity of China and should not take any action to monopolize China's economic interests. The United States opposes Japan's establishment of puppet governments in Manchuria and Central China. The United States only recognizes the Chongqing government, which is at war with Japan, as the legitimate government of China. In order to increase the Chongqing government's ability to resist the war, the United States has indirectly lent China US$45,000,000 and has repeatedly warned Japan diplomatically to encourage China's resistance. Japan has now become the most detested object of the United States. The United States has repeatedly protested Japan's occupation of Chinese territory, denouncing it as illegal and endangering American rights in China. Some of these rights are guaranteed by the US-Japan Treaty. US-Japan relations are now very tense, so the United States has taken the step of abolishing the US-Japan Commercial Treaty. Although at present only a moral embargo is adopted in terms of gasoline and aircraft exports, several broader embargoes against Japan are under discussion in Congress, but no decision has been made. A broad embargo can be implemented with the approval of the President and the Secretary of State. However, the President and the Secretary of State must act prudently and only implement such a plan when the whole country believes that it is necessary. At this time, loans to China, moral embargoes, and certain indirect means have been adopted. For example, the United States' increased shipbuilding program is one of the indirect actions. Although this is not a direct opposition to Japan, it is obviously designed for Japan's expansionist forces. Naval officers have stated that the number of Japanese fleets is already unknown, so the United States needs to build new ships. Another naval officer also expressed his personal opinion that a US-Japan war is inevitable. Since President Roosevelt took office, the United States has completed 122 new ships, with 72 currently under construction. There are also 43 others that have been passed by Congress, and 24 have been drafted and will be sent to Congress. There are also 43 that have been passed by the House of Representatives. Recently, the most attention has been paid to the issue of the Dutch East Indies. The statement issued by Japan is generally regarded as Japan intending to take the opportunity to occupy the Dutch East Indies once Germany occupies the Netherlands. Regarding the Dutch East Indies issue, the US government has warned Japan that the United States is extremely concerned about any changes in the status quo of the Dutch East Indies. Many observers believe that the result of the Sino-Japanese War will inevitably be mutual destruction. At this time, if the Soviet Union is not very strong, the balance of power in the Far East can still be established, and the United States will be quite satisfied at this moment. The current lack of vigorous action is partly due to waiting for the outcome of the incident and partly due to the hope that once the European war ends, Britain and France will cooperate more actively with the United States in the Far East.

### Panama Canal Defenses Consolidated; US Deputy Chief of Staff Speaks, Ready to Assist All States

Washington - US Army Deputy Chief of Staff Major General Sterett, speaking recently at the American Society of Engineers, strongly stated that the Panama Canal Zone's defenses are consolidated and sufficient to cope with any eventuality. He said, "Any attempt to sabotage the Panama Canal has been considered by the authorities and measures have been taken to prevent it." The construction of the new locks will be completed in 1945, at which time defense efficiency will increase by 50%. If an aggressor is determined to obtain a base in the territory of the American republics, the defense forces of each country are weak and insufficient to cope with it. It is actually necessary for us to send troops to assist, so that foreign countries do not destroy the territorial integrity of our neighboring countries. If an invaded country obtains a base in a certain republic in the Americas, we and this republic will be threatened. Therefore, we must deploy a strong military force, ready to move at any time, so that we can quickly defeat any "blitzkrieg" attempt. (Havas, 6th)

### US Naval Officers Hold Meeting, Review Recent Sea Maneuvers

Honolulu - More than 650 US naval officers, chaired by Admiral Richardson, Commander-in-Chief of the US Battle Fleet, held a meeting here yesterday to review recent sea maneuvers in the Pacific. (United Press, 7th)

### Japanese Envoys' Meeting in Latin America; Kato to Attend in Brazil; Paraguayan Envoy Tours Japan

Washington - Kato, a representative of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, recently departed from here to the capital of Brazil to attend a meeting of Japanese envoys stationed in Latin American countries to discuss various issues related to Japan's interests in each country.

### Norwegian Foreign Minister Koht Leaves England for France Today; Reportedly Wishes Sweden to Maintain Neutrality; Britain Refutes Claim of Imprisoning Norwegian Commander

London - Norwegian Foreign Minister Koht told a Reuters reporter yesterday that Norway had suffered heavy losses, with many casualties and missing persons. The Norwegian army had also lost a large part of its forces. However, there were still excellent Norwegian troops in the north, which were completely unharmed. This army would be of great help to the Allied forces, as it was the most elite in the Norwegian army, familiar with the rugged terrain, and well-equipped, but lacking anti-aircraft guns. There were approximately 50,000 to 100,000 German troops in Norway. In any case, their number was quite large. The Norwegian government had never sought help from Sweden, as Norway did not want its Swedish friends to suffer the same pain as the Norwegians and share the same fate. Sweden would, to the best of its ability, maintain its neutrality, but how things would evolve in the future was difficult to predict. When the reporter asked about the rumors of Norwegians such as Quisling being traitors, Koht replied that he had never heard of any Norwegian treason. There were Norwegians who sympathized with the Nazis, but there was no treason. (Reuters, 7th)

London - Foreign Minister Koht, in response to widespread rumors that the German army's invasion of Norway was aided by Norwegian collaborators, stated yesterday that this was inaccurate. He said, "We have not discovered any clear acts of treason. The German army's entry into Norway was easy due to the sudden attack. You cannot blame us for not taking precautions. The truth is that we never expected the German army to invade." Koht also denied the claim that the mines in the Oslo Fjord and other bays were sabotaged by traitors, rendering them ineffective, as there were no mines laid in those waters. (Reuters, 7th)

London - Foreign Minister Koht met with Prime Minister Chamberlain this afternoon. Afterwards, he told a Havas reporter, "I plan to travel to Paris on the 8th of this month for a two or three day stay to hold talks with French Prime Minister Reynaud, Defense Minister Daladier, and other key figures." He then met with reporters from various newspapers and stated, "In this chaotic world, our country is not isolated and helpless. Thinking of this fills me with excitement. The ideals that our country cherishes are no different from those cherished by Britain and France. We have always recognized ourselves as a small country with exceptionally weak military strength. It was difficult for us to shoulder major responsibilities in the international arena, so we strictly adhered to neutrality, not daring to overstep. Today, we have been forced into war to defend our homeland. But we ask ourselves if we have done anything to deserve this. Therefore, our determination to resist is even stronger." (Havas, 7th)

London - The German claim that a British warship had imprisoned Norwegian Commander General Ruge and issued orders in his name for the Norwegian army to continue fighting was refuted by responsible authorities in London. They stated that General Ruge had voluntarily boarded the British warship, which was solely for the use of Ruge and his staff. His subsequent actions were decided by Ruge himself. Ruge is currently in Norway. (Reuters, 7th)

French Troops Retreating Arrive in Scotland

London - French expeditionary forces withdrawing from central Norway have arrived at a port in northern Scotland aboard several transport ships. Although these troops were heavily bombed by German planes during their retreat from the front lines and boarding the ships, they did not suffer a single casualty. A French battalion commander told the press after landing that they had been stationed in Norway for ten days and had not seen any German troops. However, the area where they landed was heavily bombed by German planes, causing heavy losses to the residents. There were no military targets in the area, but the German planes not only bombed but also strafed with machine guns. The residents sought refuge in the mountains, and even the Allied soldiers mostly hid in the nearby forests during the day, only coming out at night. (Havas, 6th)

### Papal See in Rome Denies Rumors

Rome - Hohenbach, a correspondent for the Haitong News Agency stationed in Rome, reported yesterday that the Holy See in Rome had categorically denied the rumor reported by a Swiss newspaper that Pope Pius XII would move to Portugal if war broke out in the Mediterranean.

### Central Authorities Express Determination to Maintain Currency System; Claims of Restricting Withdrawals are Pure Rumors, Firm Statement Sent to Shanghai Chamber of Commerce

Chongqing, 7th - Recently, due to seasonal financial factors, speculators have taken the opportunity to disrupt the market, causing fluctuations in the Shanghai exchange rate. The government is making every effort to maintain stability. However, malicious individuals have spread rumors that the government will further restrict withdrawals in Shanghai, causing public anxiety. Upon hearing this news, the Ministry of Finance stated that since the beginning of the war of resistance, the government has been determined to maintain currency credibility and stabilize the financial system. All financial policies are based on this principle. The above rumors were fabricated by speculators and traitors in an attempt to disrupt public morale and undermine the financial system, which is abhorrent. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and the Banking Association have been instructed to declare that there is no such thing. It is hoped that when this message reaches Shanghai, the rumors will be refuted on their own, demonstrating the futility of the rumor-mongers' efforts.

Banking Industry's Receipts and Payments Resume Normalcy Yesterday

Since the black market foreign exchange in Shanghai has been maintained by the Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee, the British and American exchange rates have been relaxed, the market has stabilized, rumors have gradually subsided, and public confidence has slightly improved. Yesterday, the HSBC exchange rate was the same as the day before, while the US exchange rate decreased by 0.125, which is considered stable. The run on banks and financial institutions has indeed completely subsided, and the normal state of receipts and payments has resumed since yesterday. It is reported that at the beginning of this bank run, the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications supplied the industry with as much cash as possible to meet the withdrawal needs of the banks and financial institutions. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency visited a financier yesterday who stated that the Shanghai environment is becoming increasingly difficult year by year, and the market has been alarmed repeatedly, especially this year. However, the banking industry has taken into account the interests of depositors, customers, society, and the government's wartime financial policies, preserving the nation's vitality, leading by example, refraining from improper business practices, and assisting the authorities in suppressing speculation.

### Firm Belief in Resistance and Nation-Building; Commemorating May 7th

Yesterday was the May 7th National Humiliation Day, commemorating the day in 1915 when Japan presented China with the Twenty-One Demands, requiring a response within 48 hours. Yuan Shikai, who was seeking foreign support to establish himself as emperor, recognized the demands on May 9th. The Chinese community in the city did not hold a commemorative ceremony yesterday, but unanimously reaffirmed their determination to resist and build the nation, support the government, and strive for final victory.

### Intensified Restrictions on Carrying Legal Tender Inland for Export

Limit of 50 Yuan per person, effective this month

The limit for inland travelers carrying legal tender for export was previously set at 500 yuan, but was reduced to 200 yuan in February of this year. The Zhejiang Customs has recently received an order from the Ministry to limit each person to 50 yuan, which has been implemented this month.

### Polish Community in the City Celebrates National Day

The Polish community in the city celebrated the 149th National Day and the anniversary of the promulgation of the Constitution last Sunday (May 3rd) at the Polish Legation. The entire Polish community sang the national anthem, followed by a speech by Mr. Rosić, Counselor of the Polish Legation, explaining the significance of the National Day and the promulgation of the Constitution. Finally, Mr. Kidder, President of the Polish Cultural Association, gave a speech stating that Poland fully embodies the spirit of its new constitution today, citing the speech of Mr. Herriot, President of the French Chamber of Deputies, claiming that Poland is fighting for democracy and that Poland will not die. Although its body is in the tomb, its spirit will endure forever.

### Coal Dust Market Actually Uses US Dollars for Pricing; Improper Measures Alienate the People; Nanyang Coal Briquette Factory Sells Coal Briquettes at Discounted Prices

The Nanyang Coal Briquette Factory began selling coal briquettes at discounted prices yesterday, setting up ten discounted sales points, each selling 20 dan per day, totaling 200 dan per day. Sales hours are from 2:00 PM daily until sold out. Each person is limited to purchasing 3 jiao of national currency at a time, which is equivalent to 4 catties of coal briquettes, until the end of this month. The ten discounted sales points are listed below: (1) Song Taichang, 154 Route des Pères; (2) Xieyuan, 270 Rue Cardinal Mercier; (3) Dasen, 126 Rue Sazare; (4) Qiantai Xing, 202 Shanhai Pass Road; (5) Jiufeng, Lane 53, No. 66 Ximen Road; (6) Fuchang, 6 Route Grelier; (7) Kunyuan Xing, 206 Ximen Road; (8) Yixing, 985 Tokyo Road; (9) Yuxing, 220 Route Tenant de la Tour; (10) Yongmao, 68 Rue Jules Pasteau.

Priced in US Dollars

A reporter from Datong News Agency interviewed the Coal Industry Association. Mr. Qi-sheng, a member of the Standing Committee of the Association, told the reporter that the coal dust market has been pricing transactions in US dollars since May 5th, which caused him great indignation. It was found that the current price of coal dust is US$7 per ton, equivalent to RMB 155. The market price has risen, and all future transactions will be based on the US dollar. Daily necessities such as raw materials for coal briquettes are actually priced in US dollars. Even from the perspective of knowledgeable people in the industry, this is considered inappropriate.

A Glimpse of Corruption According to Mr. Bao Zhezhi, it is also a public secret that hoarders are manipulating the coal briquette market. Therefore, it is hoped that the coal industry can be cautious in selecting its customers. Orders for coal dust or coal briquettes placed by outsiders through insiders should be treated with caution, without consideration for personal relationships. People in the industry should not seek extra profits and act as accomplices. Coal briquette factories must strictly enforce the rejection of delivery orders from speculators. Raw material suppliers must not sell to third parties who are not in the coal briquette industry. Finally, it is hoped that the Public Works Department will have absolute disciplinary measures.

### Notice Regarding Postal Parcels

### Regulations for Sending Parcels with German Goods

Same Treatment for Shipments to Germans

Notice from the Postal Administration: Parcels and small packages passing through Vietnam that contain German goods or are sent from or to German citizens will be temporarily suspended from acceptance. However, if the sender indicates on the package "to be forwarded via domestic postal routes" and the domestic postal routes are indeed passable, this restriction does not apply. This matter was previously notified in the Bureau's Notice No. 1606 on April 4 of this year. Now, it has been determined that samples passing through Vietnam that contain German goods or are sent from or to German citizens will be treated the same way.

### American Community in the City Prepares to Hold "US Foreign Trade Week" with Grand Banquets and Essay Contests

The International Young Men's Association will also hold a grand banquet on May 21st.

### Public Works Department Cracks Down on Prices; Emphasizes Public Reports; Yu Huaqing's Observations on Rising Prices of Daily Necessities Confirm That It Is an Excuse to Seek Illegitimate Profits Through Exchange Rates

The Shanghai Times reported that the Public Works Department of the Public Concession issued a notice on May 3rd prohibiting merchants selling essential goods from unreasonably raising prices by taking advantage of fluctuations in the legal tender exchange rate. A reporter recently asked Mr. Cabot, Deputy Director-General of the Public Works Department, who is responsible for handling this matter, about the effect of the notice. Cabot replied that no one had reported anything yet, so the Public Works Department had not taken action against those who hoard and profiteer. Three weeks ago, the Public Works Department issued a notice asking the public to report hoarding and profiteering. If the public reports, the Bureau will definitely investigate. The reporter asked if this meant that the Public Works Department would not take any action unless a report was made. Cabot replied that it was indeed the case, and that the Bureau was awaiting reports. If there was a significant case of hoarding and profiteering, a special committee would be formed to investigate.

Mr. Yu's Opinion

Due to recent fluctuations in the exchange rate, various industries have raised their selling prices, especially for daily necessities, causing great hardship to people in the middle and lower classes, and making each day seem like a year for the working class. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency visited Mr. Yu Qiaqing, a leader in the Shanghai business community, to seek his opinion. Mr. Yu granted an interview and made the following remarks. Mr. Yu said that all prices in Shanghai have soared recently, with the excuse being fluctuations in the exchange rate, but this is not actually true. Even if the exchange rate fluctuated, the first to be affected would naturally be imported goods. Calculating the fastest possible delivery time, goods would need at least three months to arrive in Shanghai to be affected by the depreciation of the exchange rate. Therefore, the goods currently sold in stores are all in stock, so there is no reason to raise prices immediately. For example, on the morning of May 2nd, when the exchange rate fluctuated, some stores immediately raised prices by 30%, which is extremely absurd. This is actually using the fluctuation of the exchange rate as an excuse to seek illegitimate profits, which is unfair. As for rice and coal briquettes, which have also risen recently, this is even more inappropriate. These two items are essential for the daily life of ordinary people and are of utmost importance.

First, let's talk about coal briquettes. Some time ago, the Chamber of Commerce invited the coal industry to repeatedly discuss fair prices. The original price of coal dust was set at 100 yuan per ton. The cost of shipping was calculated at 28 shillings per ton, resulting in a loss of about 5 shillings. Now that the cost of shipping has been reduced to 23 shillings per ton, it is exactly 100 yuan per ton, without any loss. The cost of manufacturing coal briquettes is about 15-16 yuan per ton, plus a profit of 4-5 yuan, making it 20 yuan per ton. Adding the profit of 4-5 yuan for coal shops and 1-2 yuan for transportation, the total cost is 126 yuan per ton, or 6.3 yuan per dan. Even if affected by the exchange rate, the cost of coal dust would only increase by 20 yuan, totaling 146 yuan per ton at most. How can it be as high as 190 yuan per ton? Moreover, how can the exchange rate affect goods in stock? Are all the manufacturing costs, shipping costs, and profits of coal briquettes in Shanghai also calculated in foreign exchange and raised in price accordingly? Or are they saying that there is no significant profit to be made from making coal briquettes, so they will raise the price and sell them to yarn factories instead? If this is the case, their intentions seem inappropriate. In addition, for the sake of maintaining fair prices some time ago, the Chamber of Commerce invited the coal industry to repeatedly discuss and reach an agreement. Even if there is an immediate impact on prices due to the fluctuation of the exchange rate, they should request the Chamber of Commerce to state their reasons and reconvene to discuss the matter. However, they have resolutely taken action and raised prices twice in the past few days, no wonder the citizens are comparing them to taking advantage of a disaster.

As for rice

The price has also been rising uncontrollably. Is the rice being sold in the market now the goods that have arrived after the exchange rate fluctuation? If not, is the recent price increase due to the rice merchants and general speculators manipulating and hoarding goods? Any discerning person can see this. If this continues, how will the livelihoods of ordinary people be sustained? Weighing the pros and cons, the concession authorities and the city's Chamber of Commerce must take effective measures to curb this. Shanghai has a population of 4 million. How can we sit idly by and ignore the livelihoods of the majority of people for the sake of the interests of a few? It is hoped that merchants in all industries will prioritize their conscience in this extraordinary period, so that we can overcome the difficulties together. Otherwise, the future of Shanghai is at stake. What is the use of striving for unjust wealth?

Sales Have Stagnated

It is also learned that all items have immediately increased their selling prices during this sharp decline in the black market exchange rate. Among them, the rise in coal and coal briquettes is the most rampant. In addition, such items as cloth, hardware, general miscellaneous goods, and food have also soared in price. Some stores have even removed the price tags from their goods and are raising prices arbitrarily, without any limits. In fact, due to the extremely high cost of living and the difficulty of maintaining it, consumers in Shanghai have already been trying their best to save money. Therefore, consumption has greatly decreased. The current inventory of various goods in Shanghai is very large due to the competition to hoard goods. Even the customs warehouses are filled to capacity. Although the customs have repeatedly urged the release of goods, the sales are limited, and speculators are still trying to hoard goods, so many have not been released from the warehouses. Other clothing and miscellaneous goods are also experiencing an oversupply due to reduced consumption. In the end, those who only seek profit will only have themselves to blame.

### Telephone Company Strictly Prohibits Transfers of Telephone Sets

Announcement from Shanghai Telephone Company: Telephone sets may not be transferred privately. If discovered, penalties will be imposed in accordance with regulations. At the same time, the police authorities are requested to stop children from flying kites. It is reported that the new equipment ordered by the company will be shipped to Shanghai in the second quarter of this year, and the installation for new applicants should be completed by July or August.

### Refugee Relief Association Holds Meeting Today to Discuss Dismissal Plan

Since the Refugee Relief Association of this city started dismissing refugees last month, approximately 6,000 refugees have been sent back to their hometowns from various shelters throughout Shanghai so far. The dismissal fee for April, as stipulated by the Board of Directors of the Association, was 18 yuan for adults and 13 yuan for children (with some additional allowance). The plan for dismissing refugees in May has not yet been decided and will be discussed and decided at today's Board of Directors meeting.

### French Consul General Baudesch Departure from Shanghai Yesterday to Return to His Country for Recuperation; This Trip is Solely for Rest; Acting Consul General Inspected the Police Force Yesterday

French Consul General to Shanghai, Baudesch, has served in Shanghai for many years and has achieved remarkable accomplishments. He is now suffering from accumulated fatigue and urgently needs rest. He originally intended to request leave to return to his country earlier, but his departure was delayed due to waiting to meet with the French Ambassador. He finally boarded the French Mail Steamship Company's "Fleix Roussel" at 4:00 PM yesterday and departed Shanghai to return to his country. The French Army Commander in Shanghai, Aesu Fu Eugene, the acting consul general, and senior consulate officials, including Burke, all went to the wharf to see him off. Annamite police and a band also formed a guard of honor to respectfully send him off at the wharf. Baudesch is nearly sixty years old, and his hair is already gray. Due to his sickly condition, his face is thin. After inspecting the guard of honor at the wharf, Baudesch shook hands with each of the well-wishers to express his thanks, and then, amid the music, boarded a small boat pre-docked at the wharf and departed. It is reported that Baudesch's return to his country this time is purely for rest and recuperation, and there are no other tasks. It is said that he is scheduled to return to Shanghai in three months. There is also speculation that he will be appointed as an ambassador in another location. As for the duties of the Consul General in Shanghai during his absence, they will be handled by Eugene.

Acting Consul General Eugene Inspects the Police Force Yesterday morning (the 7th) at 10:00 AM, the French Concession Police Department held an inspection ceremony at the Gujiazhai Garden, commanded by the Chief Inspector of the French Police, Pu Lan. The teams participating in the inspection included the French Police Band, six Annamite police squads, and two Russian police squads. Each Annamite police squad was accompanied by four machine gun vehicles, commanded by Chief Inspectors Mei Shankequ YU and Inspectors Mabeige, Buquege, Aila, and Magelong. The Russian squad was commanded by Lieutenant Aitema, and was accompanied by sixteen armored vehicles with machine guns and ten armed motorcycles.

Awarding of Medals

When French Consul General Eugene and French Consul Dihuai arrived, they were welcomed into the venue by Major Faber, the head of the French Police Department, amidst the melodious music. After Consul General Eugene completed the inspection, he proceeded to award medals to meritorious personnel of the police force. Among the award recipients was Detective Jia Yu from the Western Precinct, for repeatedly handling dangerous items such as a large number of bombs in various circumstances. Also, Inspector Malun from the Western Precinct was awarded a medal for bravely capturing thieves despite difficulties. Other award recipients included Chinese Constable No. 703, Western Detective Nog, and Russian Constable Poluotuogaosiji, all of whom were awarded medals by their superiors for their meritorious service in capturing thieves. After the awards were presented, the entire force departed from Route Lafayette, marched along Route Massenet, Route Joffre, and Route Paulun, and then dispersed after completing a circuit.

A Moment of Great Splendor

Among those who attended the inspection ceremony yesterday morning were French Army Commander in China, Major Aisu Qiai Aerti Ge, Lieutenant Colonel Luo Pinghai, as well as military officers from various countries stationed in Shanghai, including the head of the Public Concession Police Department, Baona, the Director-General of the French Municipal Council, Bolei Di, and the Deputy Director, Tai Gudi. They gathered together in great numbers, making it a grand occasion.

### Radio Wave Warfare: Eagerly Awaiting Cessation

The Gospel Broadcasting Station of the Shanghai YMCA (call sign XMHD, address 128 Museum Road) has been suffering from strong radio wave interference. Unexpectedly, it was again disturbed starting the night before last. The cause of the disturbance may be due to the North China Daily News, an English newspaper, borrowing time for news reports at 9:00 PM. However, various religious and other programs before and after the news reports were also affected. Residents of this city who enjoy listening to religious broadcasts all hope that this "radio wave warfare" can be stopped as soon as possible so that they can once again listen to hymns and teachings.

### Automobile Wireless Radios Shipped to Hong Kong: Import Prohibited

Since the outbreak of the European War, the Hong Kong government has been engaged in various wartime measures. A reporter from the Da Guang News Agency learned yesterday from transportation industry sources that the Commissioner of Trade Control in Hong Kong recently issued a decree prohibiting the import of automobiles and wireless radios. This includes the engines and chassis of automobiles. Therefore, recent shipments of these items have been forced to return to Shanghai. According to the regulations, the following conditions must be met for import: (A) The consignment note must state that the goods are being shipped outside of Hong Kong. (B) The goods must be in transit or transferred from one ship to another for shipment outside of Hong Kong. (C) If the goods can be packaged, they must be packed in sturdy boxes. (D) A detailed list of the goods must be submitted to the Commissioner of Trade Control before departure. (E) If the goods are transferred from one ship to another, a detailed list of the goods must also be submitted to the Commissioner of Trade Control before departure. Fortunately, the relevant industries are paying close attention to avoid losses.

### Resumption of Work at the British United Shipyards; General Wage Increase of 15%; Amendment of the Agreement; Dismissed Workers to Receive Severance Pay

More than 1,000 workers at the Great Union Shipyards (i.e., the British-owned Ruirong, Yesong, Xiangsheng, Hefeng, United Shipyards) went on strike starting on March 14th of this year due to the factory's failure to fulfill the agreement of December 6, 1939. Mediation by the Municipal Council was ineffective, resulting in a stalemate. Recently, through the efforts of Gu Bingyuan of the Industrial Section, a complete resolution has been reached. The employer has now increased wages by 15% in accordance with the original wages, continued to recognize the union's subsidy of 100 yuan per month for loyalty fees, permanently dismissed more than 40 workers, and issued severance pay. Other improvements have been amended and announced by both parties to the agreement. All workers resumed work yesterday morning.

Brief Record of the Agreement

The British United Shipyards posted the revised labor-management agreement in the form of a notice at the entrances of each factory. A summary of the agreement is as follows: (Agreement with Workers) (1) The company recognizes the right of workers to represent the permanent fitters, lathe operators, coppersmiths, pattern makers, electricians, welders, and workshop laborers in each of the company's factories. Workers who have not been employed for a full twelve months are not entitled to the benefits stipulated in this agreement. (Bonus) (2) The company will pay a bonus to workers at the end of the year, but only if the company has dividends to distribute to shareholders. The amount of the bonus shall not be less than 10% of wages or more than 15% of wages. (Dismissal) (3) The company agrees not to dismiss any worker without just cause. Just cause refers to the following items. If any of the following reasons exist, the company has the right to dismiss workers: A. Continued business downturn for the company. B.

Workers' negligence of duty. F. Workers' repeated tardiness. G. Workers' repeated or intentional violation of company rules. (Shift Work) (4) The company may transfer workers to shift work if it deems it necessary due to a business downturn, but guarantees that workers will have at least twelve days of work out of every twenty-eight days, and will continue to be paid during the shift period. However, if workers work elsewhere during the shift period, the company will not provide a subsidy. Workers on shifts must report to the company's accounting department between 9:30 AM and 11:30 AM to collect the subsidy voucher. If the unfavorable business conditions continue to extend, the company has the right to dismiss workers.

Dismissal Allowance

If dismissal must be implemented, the company shall pay a dismissal allowance, the amount of which is as follows: Those who have worked for one year or more but less than three years will receive 25 days' wages. Those who have worked for three years or more but less than five years will receive 35 days' wages. Those who have worked for 30 years or more but less than 40 years will receive 125 days' wages. The company shall give two weeks' notice if it wishes to dismiss a worker, but this method shall be subject to the circumstances at the time. (Holidays) (5) Annual holidays are set at ten days. (Accident and Injury Allowance) (6) If a worker is injured while performing his duties, the company shall pay for medical expenses and continue to pay his wages and subsidies for three months during the treatment period. If the worker has not recovered after three months or becomes permanently disabled, the company shall provide compensation and severance pay based on the worker's years of service, with a maximum amount of 350 yuan. If a worker dies or dies from serious injuries due to an accident while performing his duties, the nearest relative will receive a pension, with a maximum amount of 450 yuan.

Various Prohibitions

(Illness and Death Benefits) (Omitted) (Work Stoppage or Strike) (9) If workers are dissatisfied, they shall notify the company of the reasons and shall notify the company of the reasons 48 hours in advance. They shall not stop work without authorization. Those who strike without permission shall automatically lose the rights stipulated in this agreement. Those who intentionally damage company property or use violence to prevent others from working shall be dismissed by the company and have their due rights canceled. If a strike by one worker affects the work of other non-striking workers, the company shall not be responsible for the wages lost by those who cannot work as a result. In the event of an illegal strike, the company has the right to lock all workers out of the factory. (Subsidy) The company agrees to continue to pay all workers a subsidy of two yuan per week (six or seven working days) as the standard, based on the Shanghai Municipal Council's survey of the average weekly price of No. 1 local white rice at 30 to 40 yuan per dan, for a period of one year.

### Hundreds of White Russian Youths in "Manchukuo" to Come to Shanghai; "Manchukuo" to Compel White Russians to Serve in the Military; Those Unwilling Plan to Flee to Shanghai

According to the Continental News, Changchun officially announced last month that starting from January 1, 1941, all White Russian youths in "Manchukuo" must serve in compulsory military service and join the "North Manchurian Army." Therefore, it is expected that several hundred White Russians from Harbin and other cities in "Manchukuo" will flee military service and move to Shanghai this year. It is reported that the "Manchukuo" conscription law was first promulgated last year, but it was implemented on a small scale, and due to the lack of military instructors, most White Russian youths were not forced to enlist. However, the number of military instructors has recently increased, and a new order was issued last month stating that starting next year, the conscription law will be applied to all White Russian youths in "Manchukuo," and large-scale military education for White Russian youths will begin. According to White Russians who came to Shanghai from Harbin, most White Russians in that area plan to come to Shanghai. The White Russian population in this city was about 25,000 two years ago and has now increased to 50,000.

### Lin Yutang's Remarks in the Philippines: America Believes China Will Win; If America Imposes an Embargo, Japan Will Be Placed in a Desperate Situation; Chinese People United as Never Before

The famous Chinese English literary writer Lin Yutang, along with his wife and three daughters, returned to China from the United States to welcome the final victory of the Chinese military. While passing through Manila, he made a statement to reporters, praising American public opinion and hoping for China's victory. He also noted that China's capabilities will certainly be able to achieve the final victory and drive out the invaders. After Lin arrived in Hong Kong, he stayed for a few days and then flew to Chongqing to reside for a long time. The following is a record of his remarks:

Americans are Confident that China Will Win

Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the mood of the American people has been in favor of China, and they believe that China has an equal opportunity to win the war and will ultimately achieve victory. Over the past six months, the feeling among Americans that China will ultimately win the war has grown. It is very gratifying to see the American people's sympathy for China's resistance and their belief that China has the strength to defeat the invaders.

Japanese Soldiers in China are at a Loss

No one can believe the words of Japanese diplomats because what they say is either insincere or contradicts what the Japanese military does. Afterwards, diplomats have to make strenuous arguments to cover up the truth. However, the Japanese are deeply at a loss on the front lines in China and cannot influence developments outside of the Far East.

America's Attitude has Become More Rigid

America's attitude towards Japan has become more rigid. It holds a potentially powerful embargo weapon that can put Japan in a deadly situation. Therefore, the Japanese are deeply afraid of the consequences of America announcing an embargo against Japan. Japan has reached the point of exhaustion in terms of manpower, and its morale and public sentiment are declining daily, while its reserves are almost depleted. China, on the other hand, has unlimited manpower, trade is proceeding as usual, and the solidarity of the people is unprecedented in Chinese history.

All Conspiracies Have Failed

The Japanese military risks approximately 40,000 casualties per month in China. This is why the Japanese military does not dare to invade Chongqing again. The Japanese are currently trying to consolidate the Chinese territories they have occupied, but they have also failed. They are trying to support puppets to consolidate the occupied areas, but puppets are still puppets. As a result, Japan has had to repeatedly send more soldiers to invade the occupied areas. Recently, one puppet even failed to gain the support of the Chinese business community in Shanghai.

### Remittance Exchange Premiums Greatly Stabilized

Profiteers Lose Their Basis

After August 13th, remittances could not be used to purchase foreign exchange, and the scope of transfers was limited to the financial industry in China. Among merchants, some gradually reduced the remittance of business income by one or two yuan per hundred yuan to obtain legal tender for their needs. Afterwards, the number of remittances on the market increased, and the amount of cash felt to be insufficient in return. As a result, those who collected legal tender to buy remittances for profit seized the opportunity to rise up. The exchange premium market soared. Since the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications commissioned banks to jointly adjust the legal tender needs of the money industry, the exchange premium market price has been greatly stabilized. However, since remittances can be converted into cash, as time goes by, more and more people are taking advantage of this, and the blockade of funds has thus had loopholes. The money industry's supply to customers is inherently limited to the genuine needs of importers, but it is impossible to be as strict as expected in reality. Since July 1st of last year, after the new system of strengthening remittances, the preparation committee's supply of cash withdrawals for remittances from various industries was stopped at the same time. Although speculators were still able to profit from the market slump at first, and forcibly held on, now that the commercial beliefs of the citizens have gradually recovered, and various industries have recognized the importance of fund blocking, the new remittance system is becoming more and more strengthened. The new remittances have been well received by industry and commerce. Foreign banks have already begun to accept the new remittances. The remittance payment reserve is now based on more than 100% of assets, so there will be no soaring market prices like those that occurred in April of last year, and speculators are gradually losing their base.

### Patrolman Loses His Mind, Shoots Driver and Passengers; Quarrel Over Prolonged Traffic Light Time; Patrolman Became Enraged and Opened Fire Indiscriminately; Four People Were Shot; The Patrolman Abandoned His Post and Fled

At approximately 11:20 AM yesterday, a shooting incident occurred at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Gordon Road in the Public Concession involving a patrolman and a tram driver. As a result, two tram passengers were shot, one person was startled and fell, and the tram driver was also shot in the head and seriously injured. The patrolman lost his mind, opened fire indiscriminately for a moment, like a madman. Seeing the disaster he had caused, he abandoned his gun, took off his uniform, and fled without a trace. The details are as follows:

Patrolman Obstructs

At approximately 11:00 AM yesterday, a tram on Route 1, driven by driver No. 119, was traveling east from Jing'an Temple. When it passed the intersection of Gordon Road and Avenue Edward VII, the patrolman No. 2618, who was in charge of the traffic lights, did not turn on the green light for a long time, causing the tram to be unable to move forward. At that time, the driver, He Dengshan (26 years old, from Nantong), believed that the tram had a company-regulated time schedule for each run, so he was very dissatisfied and spoke rudely. The patrolman was also young and hot-tempered, so he stepped forward and angrily slapped He's face. The matter was resolved after passengers and passersby persuaded them to stop.

Opening Fire Indiscriminately

At approximately 11:20 AM, when the tram returned to the intersection of Gordon Road and Avenue Edward VII from the Bund, the two first glared at each other, and then a quarrel broke out. The patrolman tried to drag He out of the tram, and He angrily said, "Dare you shoot me?" Before he could finish speaking, the patrolman ignored the consequences and pulled out his gun, firing four shots at He and the front of the tram. Amid the sound of gunfire, He was the first to be hit, and a bullet hit his head. At the same time, two passengers standing on the platform, Hu Mingyi (18 years old, from Jiangxi Jiang) and Wu Liangen (also known as Liquan, 22 years old), were also hit. Hu was shot in the chest, and Wu was shot in the right shoulder, both collapsing in a pool of blood. In addition, an old man, Ye Xuanji (63 years old, from Wujin), was too frightened and fell out of the tram, breaking his leg.

Abandoning His Post and Fleeing

For a moment, passersby did not understand the truth and thought that there was a robbery and the police were shooting, so they rushed to avoid the scene, causing great confusion. The Chinese patrolman who committed the crime saw the disaster he had caused, quickly took off his uniform, and escaped without a trace while the opportunity presented itself. Afterwards, the police received the news and sent officers to the scene to transport the injured to the Bao Long Hospital for treatment. They also launched a strict search for the patrolman. It is reported that the police found the gun that the patrolman had been carrying in a trash can somewhere on Tianzhu Road within an hour after the incident.

### A Large Sum of Money Robbed from the Hua Feng Bank

Also Affected Was the Old Accountant of Yuan Heng Trading Company

Loss of 4,500 Yuan

At 11:40 AM yesterday, three robbers suddenly entered the Huafeng Silver House, No. 304 Guohua Bank Building, Beijing Road, Henan Road, Public Concession. They were all well-dressed and impersonated customers, inquiring about the procedures for remitting money to Wuxi. At that time, the old accountant of Yuan Heng Trading Company, Yin Yongxiang (from Zhenjiang), No. 60 Henan Road, had just received 5,500 yuan in cash from the Yuanrun Sheng Trading Company, which was attached to the bank, and was in the process of counting the money. Of that amount, 1,000 yuan had already been placed by Yin in a bag, and the remaining 4,500 yuan was placed on the counter, ready to be counted again. The three robbers saw this and immediately took out guns, robbing Yin of all 4,500 yuan that he had placed out. Still not satisfied, they jumped into the counter and tied up Zhou and four other Hua Feng employees to chairs. One robber stood guard, and another 4,000 yuan was robbed. The robbers then fled, carrying their loot. After the police received the news, they rushed to the scene to search for the robbers. However, the robbers had already vanished like yellow cranes. The police have now issued a strict order for a thorough investigation in order to bring them to justice, as the robbers dared to commit robbery of a large sum of money in broad daylight in a busy downtown area.

### Japanese Aircraft Carrier Exports; Destination Unknown

American Ships Luzon and Guam

Exported the Day Before Yesterday, Returned to Shanghai Yesterday Morning

The Japanese Navy's small aircraft carrier Chiyoda entered port on the 1st of this month, moored at the 11th and 12th pontoons. On the day before yesterday (the 6th) at about 11:00 AM, it moved to the Mitsubishi Wharf on the north side of the Garden Bridge. The details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now learned that the ship suddenly left Shanghai yesterday morning at about 10:00 AM, and its destination is unknown. It is reported that the ship's displacement is only 5,000-6,000 tons, and only seven or eight aircraft can be parked on the deck. The capacity of the cabin is probably not large either, so it is definitely a small one. In addition, the two American Navy's Yangtze River gunboats, the Luzon and Guam, which had been in Shanghai for almost a month, suddenly left Shanghai for export on the 6th. However, at about 10:00 AM yesterday morning, the two ships suddenly returned to Shanghai one after the other and are still moored at the American Navy pontoon on the Yangjingbang shore.

### The Kidnapping Case of Feng and Li Remains Unresolved to This Day

Definitely a Mistaken Kidnapping Since They Are Not Wealthy

The kidnapping case of Feng Yunjii, director of the tobacco leaf department, and Li Zhitang, director of the cigarette packaging department, of the Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company, which occurred on Yu Yuan Road the day before yesterday (the 2nd), remains unresolved to this day. Reporters visited their families separately. According to them, Feng and Li have both been working at the Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company for many years, working hard and diligently. They have been promoted from small employees earning 30 yuan a month to the position of director. However, their position in the company is only that of middle-level employees, and their monthly income is only enough to feed their families. Feng and Li are colleagues with equal positions, and their family situations are about the same. It is difficult to guess what the purpose of the kidnapping is. Since the two men are not wealthy and usually focus on company business and do not ask about other external affairs, it is certain that this kidnapping was a mistaken kidnapping.

### Social News

Jiang Jinkang, a Yongbo native, 36 years old, an employee of the Deli Chicken and Duck Company at No. 728 Baylor Road, embezzled 1,600 yuan in account funds over a period of four days from the 17th to the 20th of last month.

She was discovered by her family at 11:00 AM at noon, but it was too late to save her.

Wang Xingsheng, a local, 42 years old, specializes in selling vegetables. He lives in Wangjiabang, Hongqiao Road, West Shanghai. At about 7:00 PM on the night before last, when Wang and his wife were having dinner at home, four young men, each holding a handgun, suddenly broke into the room. Without asking any questions, they kidnapped Wang Xingsheng. His wife chased him out the door, and the men fired two shots at her. Fortunately, she was not injured. It is reported that Wang's kidnapping is related to the controlled goods in the Western Shanghai area.

### Nationally Produced Seasoning with a Certified Seal of Authenticity

Seasoning powder is a necessity for daily use. However, some manufacturers of seasoning powder often cut corners, produce inferior goods, or even change labels to deceive the people, which is harmful to health. This is no small matter. The Shanghai National Seasoning Powder Manufacturers Association has specially obtained approval from the Ministry of Economic Affairs to print national product certification seals. Starting from March 1st, these seals will be distributed to member factories to be affixed to each product. In addition to the Ministry's order to overseas embassies and consulates, as well as domestic customs offices and anti-smuggling agencies, to conduct strict inspections, the association will also conduct thorough inspections and detailed chemical tests. Any products that do not meet the standard ingredients will not be allowed to be released, in order to maintain the reputation of national seasoning products. Those unscrupulous people who impersonate national products will have no way to use their skills from now on.

### Finance: The British Pound Plunges in New York, with Especially Heavy Selling from the Far East; The US Dollar in Hong Kong is Unstable; the Exchange Rate Between the US Dollar and Shanghai Currency has Rebounded

In the foreign exchange market yesterday, HSBC's listing showed a sharp contraction of six points in the morning exchange rate. The Shanghai US dollar exchange rate was quoted at 125, which is 4.375 yuan. The British pound exchange rate remained unchanged, and other exchange rates also softened slightly. The domestic situation continued to be stable. However, due to the sharp drop in the exchange rate, it resulted in a state of a strong British pound and a soft US dollar. The whole day's process had few twists and turns. Initially, Hong Kong Telegraph's supply was blocked, and Japanese banks also sought sales in the market. The potential trend was quite loose for a while, and the strongest price once reached 3.34375. At noon, speculators settled aggressively, and the price rebounded again. The market situation was still calm in the later market. In the afternoon, speculators still came to search for purchases. Thanks to the continuous sales of US banks, supply and demand were offset, and the market was very stable. The closing price also remained unchanged. As a result, the British gold price was 3.2125, and the US dollar exchange rate was 4.6875, which was higher than the previous day's British gold price by 0.03125, and the US dollar exchange rate was tighter by 0.0625. The futures and spot prices were slightly squeezed.

Looking at the New York exchange rate as an observation, a telegram on the 6th stated that the price of the British pound had plummeted, and the selling pressure was very strong, especially from the Far East. The Hong Kong US dollar exchange rate was also volatile, while the New York exchange rate for Shanghai's legal tender has rebounded from 4.75 yuan to 4.8 yuan. The future trend of international exchange rates is also worthy of attention.

Japanese Banks Sell US Dollars

In the early morning, London's long-term and short-term interest rates were flat, New York's silver price remained flat, and London's raw gold remained stagnant. The British pound exchange rate against the US dollar did not move, the exchange rate against Shanghai's legal tender was up 0.125, and the exchange rate against the French franc remained unchanged. The US dollar exchange rate against the British pound contracted by 0.0625, the exchange rate against Shanghai's legal tender was up 0.05, and the exchange rate against the French franc fell by 0.035. The central bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. The banks' opening spot selling prices in the morning were 3.28125 for British gold and 4.65625 yuan for the US dollar exchange rate, which was flat for British gold and tighter by 0.09375 for the US dollar exchange rate compared to the previous night's closing prices, due to the sharp drop in the exchange rate. Shortly after the opening, Hong Kong Telegraph came to sell, and the price started to loosen. Hong Kong Telegraph sold spot British gold to foreign banks for 3.3125, and the spot US dollar exchange rate traded at 4.6875. HSBC's listing was announced, with the British pound exchange rate unchanged and the US dollar exchange rate slightly tighter by 0.125, at 4.375 yuan. The silver balance tax was announced with no change. Later, Japanese banks also sold, and foreign banks' appetite was very weak, with a full supply intention, resulting in a faster loosening of the market. In May, Japanese banks sold US dollars at 4.4375. At times, the spot British gold price was seen at a maximum of 3.34375, and the US dollar exchange rate was 4.75 yuan. Speculators sold US dollars for May delivery to foreign banks at 4.5 yuan. At noon, speculators suddenly started buying, and the market rebounded. The closing prices were 3.28125 for British gold and 4.65625 yuan for the US dollar exchange rate, which were the same as the opening prices in the morning. The futures and spot prices were slightly squeezed.

Strong Supply from US Merchants

Although Chinese merchants and speculators frequently settled in the afternoon, the market situation remained stable due to the strong supply from US banks. Transactions were made, including May US dollars, with speculators absorbing from 4.4375 yuan to 4.5 yuan. The evening closing still showed hardening. As a result, the British gold price was 3.3125, and the US dollar exchange rate was 4.6875. The British gold price for this month was 3.15625, and the US dollar exchange rate was 4.4375. Compared to the previous night's spot closing price, the British gold price rose slightly by 0.03125, while the US dollar exchange rate tightened by 0.0625.

### Gold Market Lingers, Not Yet Free From Rising Trend

Yesterday's spot cash dark market conditions showed that people's confidence was strong, and the rising atmosphere was still thick. Although it rose and then fell, the result continued to trend upward. The opening in the morning was good at 11 yuan. Then, the gold shop first entered, and for a time, there was a great lack of sellers. It was then raised to 7,100 yuan. Later, due to the loose foreign exchange market, it was inevitable to cause floating accounts to sell off. Securities and money exchange firms sold strongly, causing it to be pressed into the 7,000 yuan range. The lowest was reported at 6,970 yuan. Until around 11:00 AM, the exchange market rebounded. A certain gold shop and securities gangs competed to buy, and under the atmosphere of buying pressure, the surface market broke through 7,100 yuan, seeing a high price of 7,140 yuan. However, the noon closing was only 7,080 yuan. The gold shops searched for purchases without lagging behind. Unexpectedly, it was suppressed by the securities gangs and gold shops, falling to 7,025 yuan. Before the close, the silver shop gangs scooped up some, and the result was still reported at 7,060 yuan, an increase of 50 yuan from the previous day. The whole day's trading went from prosperous to clear, with a transaction volume of more than 3,000 taels. The price of jewelry gold first fell and then returned to flat. The customs gold price remained stagnant.

Red Increased by 50 Yuan

From the beginning in the morning, although the exchange rate fell sharply, the Shanghai US dollar exchange rate tightened and then rebounded slightly. Therefore, there were still sellers when it opened, and it was only slightly raised by 10 yuan. The silver shop sold to the jewelry gang for 7,020 yuan per 10 taels. Later, due to the gold shops seeing the low and searching for purchases, it immediately rose by 80 yuan. The silver shop sold to the securities gang for 7,100 yuan for 20 taels. However, there were many limit-priced sellers at the above price, and the rise was blocked. A certain money exchange company suddenly came to sell, and it immediately turned downward. Soon after, a certain securities gang and gold shop followed suit, and the foreign exchange market was still reporting loosening. The buyers fell short, and they actually retreated into the 7,000 yuan range. The securities gang sold to the gold shop for 6,970 yuan for 20 taels. After that, the sellers gradually decreased, and the gold shops absorbed slightly. The market situation stabilized, and they immediately returned to over 7,000 yuan. Unexpectedly, a rising wind suddenly started around 11:00 AM. The gold shop and another securities gang competed to buy, and the foreign exchange market tightened. Retail investors saw the scene and rushed to buy. In an instant, it soared by more than 100 yuan. The gold shop bought from the money exchange company for 7,140 yuan for 10 taels. At noon, the buying wind subsided slightly, and the gold shop sold again, falling back by 60 yuan. The gold shop sold to the silver shop for 7,080 yuan for 20 taels as the noon closing price. In the afternoon, the sentiment was quite good, opening high by 40 yuan. The silver shop bought from the gold shop for 7,120 yuan for 10 taels. Later, a certain gold shop sold, and it immediately fell back by a small amount of 40 yuan. The gold shop sold to the money exchange company for 7,080 yuan for 10 taels. Then, the silver shop came to buy again, regaining 20 yuan. The gold shop bought from the securities gang for 7,100 yuan for 20 taels. The reason for the certain securities gang, the gold shop doing long positions came to short sell, and the exchange market reported being hard, a lack of buyers, and it fell by 75 yuan. The money exchange company sold to the silver shop for 7,025 yuan for 20 taels. After entering, the silver shop saw it cheap and scooped it up, and it went up again. The gold shops did 30 taels, and the evening closing price was 7,060 yuan. As a result, it rose by 50 yuan compared to the previous day. It has been rising for seven consecutive days, a total of 1,488 yuan. The whole day's ups and downs totaled 170 yuan. The current spot gold selling price of the gold shops, at premium, is more than ten yuan higher. The receiving price is reduced by 30 yuan. The current margin gold is more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold. There were few transactions.

Jewelry Gold Wanted to Fall but Stopped

The initial selling price of jewelry gold per tael in silver shops was still suspended at 727 yuan in Datong Hang. Until 10:30, it listed a small price of 10 yuan. At 11:30, it rebounded by 10 yuan.

Both the early and noon markets were listed at 2 jiao.

### Foreign Currencies Rise and Fall Unevenly

Yesterday's foreign currency market situation showed that there was still no lack of demand for British and American gold pounds. The market prices consistently continued to rise by one yuan. In the morning, the supply and demand for British gold notes were even. In the afternoon, the black market British exchange rate trended downward, so it finally fell by one yuan. The American gold notes started high at 21.78 yuan in the early morning due to the British pound price plummeting by 0.0625. Later, it retreated to 20.09 yuan. The noon closing was 21.2 yuan. The afternoon situation was very stable. The evening market was 21.1 yuan. As a result, there was no difference compared to the previous day. There was quite a need for Hong Kong notes in the morning. The market price rose slightly. In the afternoon, it gradually returned to flat. There was a slight demand for French franc notes, and the price rose by one cent. There was a sudden supply of Annam notes, and the market trended downward. The same industry slightly needed ruble notes, and the price rose slightly. Canadian notes fell back by 0.5 yuan. The trend of Japanese gold notes was slightly firm. The evening market price was 1.277 yuan. There was a demand for Korean notes, and the evening market retreated to 0.995 yuan.

### Securities: Foreign Stock Transactions Lively, Domestic Bonds Little Trading

The securities dark market situation yesterday was still a circling with a tired state. Transactions were still not vigorous. Customers continued to have spot goods flowing out. Buyers were weak, and most were making small, covering buys. Domestic warfare held, and foreign countries were gradually changing. Public bonds were being hit at any time. The prospects were difficult to be optimistic about. The high interest was weighing on them, and they were hesitant. The exchange rate arbitrage interest was generous, so they abandoned this and took that, so it became even more deserted. Yesterday's buying and selling were still dominated by more sellers and fewer buyers, or exchanging C to D, to take advantage of the surplus after the lottery, or exchanging D to C, hoping to win the lottery. Each had their own desires, which had exceeded the usual speculative position. The changes were still to come. As a result, the market prices, except for type A, remained unchanged, and the rest were slightly lower by 0.05 to 0.2 yuan. The total transaction volume was estimated to be 500,000 to 600,000 yuan. A simple table is listed below.

Stock transactions: 30 shares of Dasheng's third share were traded at a price of 30 yuan.

When the Zhongye stock market opened, although there was no selling pressure, the potential trend was slightly soft. Most of the prices were generally slightly lower than the previous closing price. In the first hour, it seemed that there was a continued decline. Later, due to people's confidence rebounding, prices were able to be supported. Although the trading volume was not bad, the activity seemed to have decreased slightly. There was nothing particularly noteworthy about the buyers' interest. Among the real estate stocks, Zhonghe shares had the highest demand, and the price jumped sharply from 22.5 yuan at the opening to 24.75 yuan at the closing. Buyers were still not satisfied at this price. The opposite of Yeguang shares fell several cents, closing at 16.7 yuan, while the previous closing was 17.2 yuan. 29,500 shares of Shanghai Enterprise shares were traded, and the appreciation was thus. The price was bought from 8.35 yuan at the opening to 8 yuan at the closing. The glory of the English Allied shares was not exhausted, and 44,400 shares were traded. The opening price was 73 yuan for buying and 73.5 yuan for selling. It once fell to a low of 70.5 yuan, and then recovered to 72 yuan at the closing.

Although the price of rubber shares fell, there were still many people who needed them. Lange Zhi Zaihui was most affected by the back wind, and the price fell from 47 yuan at the opening to 45.5 yuan for buying and 45.75 yuan for selling. Yingzhahua also fell by 2 yuan, and Rubber Trust retreated by 0.7 to 0.8 yuan. Each stock has buyer interest to maintain, so the situation cannot be said to be bad.

London, July 6 (Monday) - Today's listing market for Chinese foreign debt showed that the reorganization loan and the English issue of the qian bond fell by 1.5 pounds, and the price was 33.5 pounds. The rest remained unchanged.

London, July 6 (Monday) - Today's listing market for the stocks of British Far East companies showed that the Gula Ke Lin Pang rubber shares fell back by 3 pence, and the price was 18 shillings and 3 pence. The rest remained unchanged.

### Shanghai Enterprise Issues New Shares

The total amount of shares of Ying Shang Shanghai Enterprise Co., Ltd. is 1 million shares, with each share worth 5 yuan of national currency. The total capital is 5 million yuan of national currency. In addition to the 370,000 shares already issued, which are worth 1.85 million yuan of national currency, the board of directors has now resolved to issue 555,000 shares from the 630,000 unissued shares. The issue price per share is 5.5 yuan of national currency. It is stipulated that 2 old shares can subscribe for 131 new shares. The full amount of shares must be paid to HSBC before May 15th. All shareholders registered on May 10th have the right to apply for subscription.

### Yarn and Cotton: Bulls Already Selling Off, Yarn Market Turning to Mild, Real Sales Difficult to Develop

The yarn market has started to rise, then returned, and the trend has become slightly milder. However, most people still see it as good, so as soon as the market price loosens, buyers will come one after another. As for the real sales level, large transactions are very lacking. Only Hong Kong takes the lead in scattered purchases, one after another.

Due to the good sentiment in the afternoon of the previous day, the market continued to advance for spot yarn in the morning. The single price of 20s Shuangma Factory was 1,705 yuan. Later, it was reported that the foreign exchange rate had increased slightly, and the gold price was calm. Many parties were selling again, and the market situation was relatively relaxed, falling to 1,680 yuan. After the closing, it rebounded slightly. The transaction statistics for half a day were 1,790 packages. The quotation for 20s Shuangma increased by 12 yuan. The amount purchased by each bang mouth is listed as follows: Same Industry 1,070, Hong Kong 550, Mainland 125, Nanhai 30, Ningbo 15. Total 1,790.

### Cotton Market Improves

The domestic cotton market has already shown signs of improvement. Chinese factories have some demand, so people's confidence is firm. Same industry transactions are still as lively as ever, so the market is stable. The spot cotton transaction situation is listed below: Da Zhong Ji 200.00, Xin Yu Jin 100 packages, Pingguo Er 126.00, Same Industry Jin 300 pieces, Xia He Da 33.00, Rong Feng Jin 218 pieces, Da Zhong Ji 300.00, Same Industry Jin 90 pieces, Pila 280.00, Same Industry Jin 200 pieces, Peng Jia Pu 302.50, Same Industry Jin 50 pieces, Mail Bag Cotton 333.00, Xin Sheng Jin 184 packages, Mite Lin 350.00, 340.00, Cheng Fu Jin 64 pieces.

In addition, the market price of foreign cotton, due to the selling pressure from all parties in the New York cotton market yesterday, and then due to the short selling and long selling of the South, the closing price was 10 points lower for the near term and 14-15 points lower for the far term. India fell 3 rupees, including the forecast. Egypt was closed.

The foreign cotton transactions in Shanghai yesterday turned active again. The Tianjin gang had a strong buying intention, and a certain factory also had a slight appetite yesterday. As a result, the same industry was quite excited. In fact, the current inventory in the market is very thin, and the selling price is 30-40 yuan lower than that of foreign firms. However, I am afraid that the spot price will still catch up with the futures selling price in a few days. The factory price converted to US dollars at 4.625 yuan is as follows: 20s American Mite Lin 374.50, 20s Sub-Grade 306.20, 32s 399.70, 32s Sub-Grade 385.00, 42s 402.60, 42s Sub-Grade 398.20.

### Grain: Rice Prices Slightly Flat - Prices Have Been Announced -

The rice market was still flat and tired yesterday, because the market changes were too strong, and buyers did not dare to buy rashly. The sales market was very weak at the beginning of the morning, and the selling wind was strong. They all took small transactions as a game, and the shouts fell, step by step, near yuan. It opened at 48.5 yuan. Unexpectedly, when this price came out, the general floating national retail investors immediately pulled in, and the mutual echoes and shouts rose one after another. In a moment, it returned one yuan, and the small grain was restored to 49.5 yuan. However, the real sales were limited, and half of them were mental transactions, which were difficult to keep. It was still depreciated by half a yuan. After that, it wandered all the way, often in and out around this price, and finally closed at 49 yuan. Other goods, such as Saigon and Siamese, were more stable due to more real sales. The market only fluctuated by 0.5 yuan throughout the market. Only broken rice and rice green had even supply and demand, and the selling prices were similar.

The rumors about thick and thin japonica rice and other domestic rice spread outside the market, so they were also depressed. The Wuxi Qing special japonica rice has opened at 51.5 yuan, the powdered embryo is 49 yuan, the Qingsi thin rice and the Nanhai early and late rice are all high from 49.2 yuan, and the decision is made to 48 yuan. Although glutinous rice is a seasonal product in demand, the sales are not widespread, and the goods are crowded in the warehouse, resulting in cheap goods and low prices, and it cannot be supported by low prices, and it can be seen that it has fallen by one yuan. The selling price of Jinli Special Yuan is 42.5 yuan, 42 yuan, the Chang Dan Gao Yuan is 41.4 yuan, and the second to the tide soft is 38-39 yuan.

Due to the gradual flattening of foreign exchange rates, the interest of speculators in foreign rice has gradually faded, and profitable bulls have competed to sell, so market prices have been difficult to maintain. The current rice is particularly tired, especially Siamese, because there is still a ship of 2,800 tons arriving in port on the 9th tomorrow, and people are very worried. For example, the early and late market opening prices of No. 2 Siamese were 49 yuan, and in the afternoon, they fell to 47.5-47.6 yuan. The slightly inferior ones only opened at 47.1 yuan, which was more than 1.5 yuan smaller. The afternoon closing of No. 2 Saigon Small Grain was smaller than the early market yuan, but the owners of the original packaged return No. 2 Saigon goods insisted very strongly, and the downward trend was slower. The original root settlement price for the first period of May still opened at 60 yuan, and the market opened at 59.3-59.5 yuan, which has arrived from 59.2-58.7 yuan. A total of more than 400 tons were sold, and more than 6,000 bags of spot goods.

### Noodles Sold to Southeast Asia, Local Noodle Shops Requesting Fair Prices, Flour Mills Still Say Not Enough Cost

Yesterday's flour market was fixed and firm. The No. 2 flour mill's price was still 14 yuan, and the customer price was still as high as 15 yuan. This was because the sales of Nan Yang powder in the daily market suddenly moved, and someone was purchasing it in Shanghai. Both rice and noodles were being shipped, so people's hearts were better. The price of the return goods Lao Che brand was two to three cents higher than the factory price, and those who held them still regarded them as rare goods. Inland flour was also the same, so the current retail price of each bag in various flour shops ranges from 14.2-4 yuan. It is said that the machine-cut noodle industry is filing a request to suppress the price of flour. According to the factory's news, the raw materials are expensive, and the wholesale price in this street is still maintained. However, the price of rice has already fallen yesterday and today. If the price of four bags of flour is calculated at one stone of rice, the price of flour is already higher than the price of rice. It is also said that the sales of inland flour are not weak. For example, Shunfeng brand opened at 14.3 yuan yesterday, which was 5 points harder than the previous day. The wheat market still persisted because the factory wanted to suppress the price.

### Oil Cakes: Soybean Cake Sales Season Has Arrived

Yesterday's oil cake market situation went in opposite directions, soybean oil supply and demand were not equal, and it continued to fall outside the yuan. Peanut oil market prices rose and fell unevenly. However, the soybean cake sales market was booming and flourishing. People's hearts were quite lively, and market prices often rose. Yesterday, each cake was raised by two, three, or four cents. It is estimated that there were more than enough factory four cake and 2,000 slices that were bought from the chemical gang, and the price was 11.7 yuan. The mainland group stomach distributed seven carts of Changzhou Yuanlong cake (620 slices per cart), and the price was 10.08 yuan. The Shantou gang asked for 2,000 slices of Yantai cake, and the price was 10.02 yuan. More than 15,000 slices of Sipai cake, the price was 10.08 or 10.075 yuan.

Also, 200 bags of yellow soybeans were shipped from Qingdao yesterday (7th), with 690 pieces of soybean oil.

### Sugar Market: Diao Qing Rose by Five Yuan

Yesterday's sugar market trend turned flat. The association's planning prices were: 24 crude white, this warehouse goods were 76.7 yuan, foreign warehouse new goods were 76.7-76.5 yuan, old goods were 76.3-76.2 yuan, transshipment goods were 60 yuan, Taikoo car white B mark 487 yuan, and the large ones were 86.5 yuan, which can be obtained. This warehouse was 66.7 yuan, transshipment was 55.5 yuan, H mark car red was 63 yuan, and the rest lacked changes. 300 foreign packages of Guotang Diao Qing were transacted yesterday, and the price was 62-62.7 yuan, which was 5 yuan higher than the previous (2nd). Dozens of pieces of Tiao Qing were still 52 yuan. It was heard that Xinghua Qing was 470 yuan, but it was too far away.

### North and South Goods: Golden Daylily Also Subject to Control, How Can Market Prices Be Cheap?

Golden daylilies have always been traded through remittance and transfer. Recently, the premium has exceeded 200 yuan outside the customs. Although it has slightly recovered recently, the source is still subject to control by a certain market, so external expenses have increased sharply, and the cost is even higher. Currently, sales have also become active, and the trend is quite strong. According to production news, this year's new goods must be marked at 50 yuan, so everyone is unanimously optimistic. It is reported that a batch of Guangbang's top-grade vegetables was 55 yuan the day before, and even the prices of regular goods have risen sharply in recent days. It is estimated that more than 70 bags from Zhongxing Suqian were 48 yuan, Daxing vegetables were 52 yuan, and Gaoxiangzhuang was 53.5 yuan. It is said that the price will increase by 10 yuan before and after.

### Silk and Tea: New Tea Market Opening

In the past two days, the new green tea produced and sold by foreign firms, the manufacturers have put one or twenty new samples on the market. Yesterday, more than one hundred boxes of fine tea leaves were collected by Xiehe, Shihe, Jinlong and other firms, with prices ranging from 430 yuan to 460 yuan. According to the cost estimate of the merchants, all of them will inevitably suffer losses, and the situation is slightly unprofitable. It is reported that most of the new and old goods recently purchased by various firms are for export on the Italian postal ship "Contro Rosso". At this time of the Mediterranean war, both Chinese and foreign tea merchants are mostly taking a wait-and-see attitude.

### A Letter to All Shanghai Students from the University and Middle School Student Association

(Three)

Second, we must use the program of resistance and national reconstruction as our goal of hard struggle.

Reading is of course our basic work, but our hard struggle must also have a definite goal. Otherwise, we will easily be tempted and shaken, and there will be the danger of blindly following others. We know that China's only way out now is to resist to the end. Of course, we oppose any peace compromise. However, long-term resistance is indeed a very difficult and arduous task. Because the purpose of this resistance is not only to resist Japanese aggression. We are not only engaged in resistance, but also actively engaged in national reconstruction, establishing a new country of freedom and equality. Therefore, resistance and national reconstruction are progressing simultaneously. To achieve the goal of winning the resistance and succeeding in national reconstruction, the first thing we must do is strengthen our self-esteem and self-confidence. Young people are the pillars of the country, and we should especially strengthen our

belief in resistance.

Leading the people to participate in the work of resistance and national reconstruction. However, as I said before, studying hard is saving the country. This means that we students must engage in saving the country through our basic work. In other words, we must do appropriate extracurricular activities. We must be a model for the people and hold an absolutely optimistic attitude towards the country. We must clearly recognize our goal: the purpose of long-term resistance is to build a new China of independence, freedom, and the Three Principles of the People. Compromise along the way is suicide. Therefore, we oppose the deceptive peace of surrender to the people. We must eliminate the small number of wavering elements in our ranks. Of course, we also hope that they will have a final awakening and be able to abandon evil and return to righteousness and participate in the work of resistance and national reconstruction together. We must clearly recognize that this resistance is the

only way

for the Chinese nation to strive for independence, freedom, and equality. The responsibility of saving the country must be shouldered by everyone. This time, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek also made it clear to us at the Fifth National Political Council, "No matter how difficult the environment of resistance has been in the past two years, the national policy of resistance has always been firm." The reason why the national policy of resistance can be so firm is because the people of the whole country have consistently supported the program of resistance and national reconstruction. We students have the most glorious history in the past, so when it comes to such a great festival, we cannot but encourage each other. Most importantly, we must clearly judge right and wrong and distinguish between good and evil.

### The 10th Public Exhibition Handball Championship Already in the Grasp of Zhongqing; Three Doubles Matches Won Last Night; Tonight's Outcome is Irrelevant

After the tenth Public Exhibition Cup handball competition, with both the Chinese and Western sides each winning one round, the final decisive round has resulted in a difficult-to-resolve balanced situation. The acquisition or loss of the championship therefore depended on the five doubles matches that began last night. The Zhongqing side, recognizing the seriousness of the situation and the need to deploy unconventional tactics in order to win, decided to bring up Jiang Jiadu and Sun Jialu from the student ranks and replace Gao Zisan of the fifth group and Cheng Zunhua of the third group. Their strength has thus become even more formidable. Zhongqing is determined to win. In last night's three matches, apart from the extremely tense situation in the fourth group, the fifth and third groups won with overwhelming momentum, each winning in straight sets. Currently, Zhongqing has won the third round with an 8-5 victory. In the overall results, they have triumphed with a 2-1 victory. The championship is already within their grasp. There are still two main group battles tonight, but the outcome is irrelevant.

### Spring Welcoming Ritual (2)

The Spring Official is usually played by a beggar, as no one is willing to take on this arduous task. The Mang God previously had a pair of glass lamp fixtures, followed by several pairs of lamp fixtures with gold characters on blue gauze. Behind him were dozens of people from various government offices, beating gongs and drums with loud shouts. Finally, incense smoke swirled around, with people carrying incense burners and incense trays walking in unison. At the very end was a gilded vermilion lacquer shrine, representing the arrival of Tai Sui. In front of the shrine were three or four layers of candle stands, filled with burning candles. The candles that had burned in front of the god were known as "yuanbao" (silver ingots) in the vernacular, and people competed to buy large candles to take home, calling it "great luck." Those who were unable to buy candles in time would throw money, either dozens, hundreds, or thousands of coins, towards the god before taking a candle away. The shopkeepers they passed would distribute leftover candles, calling it "sending yuanbao," the price of which was several times the value of the candle. Among the officials welcoming spring, the first was the director of education from the prefectural government. From the flags and gongs to the umbrellas and fans, and even the execution tools and divination sticks, all were equipped with red and black hats, and more than a dozen people held whips to clear the way. The clerks of the departments and those carrying registers and seals all wore neat attire and rode slowly past on horseback. At the end was a tiger-skin armchair, carried high by four people, representing the official seat of the prefectural governor. Next was the Water Conservancy prefectural governor, followed by the Chief Constable prefectural governor, their ceremonies similar to the first. After the three prefectural governors, the magistrates of Ren and Qian counties followed closely. The clerks and servants in the county offices were numerous, and their bright ceremonial guards were especially impressive.

### Becoming a Person of the World (4)

Similarly, a certain wealthy person may be a good family head and neighbor at home, but as soon as he arrives at the office, his attitude changes drastically, becoming as cunning as a fox and as fierce as a tiger. Therefore, all those who compete with him call him an "unscrupulous person." Is he really without conscience? His conscience is only private, not public. Again, legislators, using the convenience of their positions, enact all kinds of laws that benefit the locality, without considering the interests of the entire country. People like this all need a broad conscience that puts the country first. However, nationalism, if taken to extremes, is narrow, such as illegally invading other countries, which is not a blessing for the country or the world. Therefore, they must go a step further and have a conscience for the world, regardless of language, ethnicity, or national boundaries, and seek happiness for all mankind. (3) A kind of world work, everyone should work. But why work? For life? No. If only for life, cows and horses are better at it. For the family? No, if only for the family, tigers and wolves are also good at protecting their own kind. For the country? No, if it is only for the country, how is it different from the Greeks who do not believe in Christ? The ideal of Christians is that people must work for humanity—the world. He must live in such a way that his daily work is connected with the work of promoting world evolution. He is a person with a mission, and his mission is to feed, heal, educate, and redeem the world. In ancient times, those who worked for humanity included Abraham Lincoln in the United States, who advocated the emancipation of slaves, and Wesley Livingston, who preached abroad; General Gordon, who was chivalrous and sacrificed his life for other countries. There are countless others; they are all people who worked for world humanity. In short, who is the one who has these three qualities? It is Jesus of Galilee. He devoted his life to the needs of mankind, to the transformation of the world, and sacrificed his life. He is a good model for us to be human. Finished.

Public Voice

### Perish Together

— Yan Zheng

It's really getting more and more absurd. A ten-tael ingot of silver can be valued at more than seven thousand dollars. A US dollar can be exchanged for more than twenty national currency. Some people hoard rice and coal; others hoard cotton yarn and cloth. No matter what the commodity, it is sealed up and sent to the warehouse. It is said, "The price hasn't risen enough yet, not selling!"

Some also take out a little to sell, but their prices make you shake your head. The 工部局 (Gong Bu Ju) 's notice prohibiting the unauthorized raising of prices seems to have no effect at all.

They really want to squeeze every drop of the public's blood and sweat! Although they know very well that the public's purchasing power is dwindling. They are making "immediate money," squeezing as much as they can!

Some have already been squeezed naked and barefoot, even starving to death. Some have been squeezed almost dry, and have no choice but to shamelessly run back to their hometowns in the occupied areas. Those are the weaklings. But there are also those who are tough, unwilling to sit and wait, and take risks for "survival." Haven't you seen the social news reported in the past few days?

Regardless of whether the means are legitimate, "wanting to eat" is a common desire. By then, when they have lost the object of their wealth, it will be the time when they won't let you alone hold a golden bowl and eat leisurely!

At that time, even if you hoard gold bars and US dollars, you will perish together!

### Save Everyone (Public Voice, Part 2)

— Someone

I am a small office worker in a foreign firm, with a monthly salary of fifty-six dollars. Before the war, it was not too shabby to support a family of three (wife and child). But the cost of living after the war has almost increased four or five times. Although I have requested a raise several times, the employer has only increased my salary by 15% and added a living allowance of ten dollars (totaling seventy-four dollars and forty cents). But to support this small family, even just dealing with food and housing is very pitiful.

Because a twelve-dollar attic before the war now costs eighteen dollars. Rice and food cost at least thirty dollars or more per month. Other things like coal briquettes, oil, salt, soy sauce, and vinegar are all frighteningly expensive. And what's worse is that in this round of price increases, "sitting and waiting for death" is certainly not an exaggeration.

Naturally, thinking a step back, someone like me with such an income could probably be classified as middle-class in this metropolis, right? In this wave of unemployment, I should be calm and patient, and endure this difficult time. But our current suffering is not directly affected by the war, which cannot be denied. People standing on the same boat not caring about the safety of the whole is what makes us have to stand up and shout loudly. At the same time, it is precisely because we are middle-class that it makes you wonder how those in the lowest class are supposed to survive?

There is a story that tells us:

When a great flood submerged a village, two brothers each carried all their belongings and fled in two small boats. On the way, the older brother felt that the younger brother's boat had more things than he did. The two argued, and the older brother secretly devised a plan to stun the younger brother, throw him into the water, and move the things from the younger brother's boat to his own. But that small boat was overloaded. When a wave hit, it sank, and the older brother naturally drowned in the water as well.

Chinese compatriots living on the "isolated island" are just like the brothers in that village. We should tie the two small boats together tightly to resist the current waves! Otherwise, the realization of this story is only a matter of time.

Save everyone! It is also saving yourself!

### Recent Commodity Prices in Sichuan

— Hua Jian

I recently received a letter from a friend in Zigong, Sichuan, which included a summary of commodity prices in Sichuan. I am reprinting it below:

Rice: $10 per dou (peck) Blue calico: $1.40 per foot
Coal: 5-6 cents per catty (pound) White cotton cloth: $1.50-1.60 per foot
Pig lard: $1.20 per catty Washcloth: Over $2 per piece
Vegetable oil: $1.10 per catty Hemp yarn socks: $7-8 per pair
Chicken: Over $3 per bird Crepe satin: $3-4 per foot
Duck: Over $2 per bird Silk satin: $3-4 per foot
Fish: Over 10 cents per liang (ounce) Silk floss: $7-8 per catty
Meat: 65 cents per catty Cotton: 5-6 dollars per catty
Eggs: 5-6 cents per egg Gongni shoes: $12 per pair
White sugar: $1.40 per catty
Salt: 40 cents per catty
Tofu: 4 cents per block

From the above summary of commodity prices, we can see that commodity prices in Sichuan are not simply rising wildly. The prices of pig lard, vegetable oil, chicken, and duck are similar to those in Shanghai, as they are not entirely dependent on imported goods. The prices of eggs, meat, and salt are cheaper than in Shanghai because they are local products. However, blue calico, white bamboo cloth, hemp yarn socks, crepe satin, etc., are more expensive because they are entirely dependent on transportation from Shanghai or Hong Kong, which is quite different from the situation in Shanghai, where there is hoarding. Imported goods. The prices of eggs, meat, and salt are cheaper than in Shanghai because they are local products. However, blue calico, white bamboo cloth, hemp yarn socks, crepe satin, etc., are more expensive because they are entirely dependent on transportation from Shanghai or Hong Kong, which is quite different from the situation in Shanghai, where there is hoarding.

### Poor Bones Can't Hold On Any Longer

— Jin Chuan

Public Voice, Part 3

Gold has risen and foreign exchange has shrunk, so the merchants are taking advantage of the situation again, licking blood from their knives. The burden of life has doubled, making it difficult for my few poor bones to support! I cry to heaven, but there is no response; I enter the earth, but there is no door. Rice costs fifty dollars, coal briquettes cost nine dollars. The prices of daily necessities are rising daily and are impossible to keep track of. They all open their mouths and raise prices by 30% or 50%. But our stomachs cannot go a day without food. However, life is so expensive that we cannot reach it. I do not have the magic of turning things into gold, and I am even considering whether pills can replace food. Even if the few poor bones are made of steel, steel will break; even if the blood is tap water, tap water will run dry. When we reach this point of broken bones and dried-up blood, the poor will all become starving corpses. The merchants' bellies will swell like graves, filled with so many poor bones. They can certainly make fortunes of hundreds of thousands of dollars, but it is likely that after a while, their bellies will burst and they will all perish together. Those on the sidelines will be happy and benefit. It chills me to think of it!

Confucius said, "Oppressive government is fiercer than a tiger!" Now, life is fiercer than a tiger! Tigers can be avoided, but the burden of life cannot be avoided!

Merchants, show some conscience and save hundreds of thousands of compatriots from becoming starving corpses. Otherwise, they will only die in front of you! But how long can you be happy?

Chapter 23: Old Friends, New Companions, Writing is Valuable; Famous Scenic Spots, People in Charge Obtain

Therefore, in order to prevent the scenic spots from being defaced, the construction of private tombs in scenic areas is absolutely prohibited. Even in non-scenic areas, there are certain restrictions on the land occupied by tombs. Because the land is used for production, and after China's revival, we need to ensure that there are no wandering people in the countryside and no wasteland. However, so much land is occupied by the dead, which is too meaningless. Fortunately, there are now public cemeteries everywhere in China. A plot of public cemetery land can bury many people. Moreover, the practice of cremation is gradually becoming popular. Speaking of advertising, it is even more strictly prohibited in scenic areas. For example, in the past, whenever you encountered a place with the most beautiful scenery, with green mountains looming and blue waters stretching, you would want to relax on a pavilion and look into the distance. But there would always be a big billboard blocking your view, which would be very annoying. Not to mention advertisements for gonorrhea and eye diseases, with naked and ugly women painted on them, or warriors with upturned mustaches, which would make people feel uncomfortable. Even legitimate commercial advertisements are not allowed to be placed in scenic areas. Billboards are not prohibited, but if you want to attract attention, you can set them up in designated areas in the market. Why bother ruining the scenery? Not only are tombs and advertisements prohibited, but also private residences and villas are prohibited. Unless the building is open to the public and anyone can visit it, then it is considered public property. Although many pavilions and buildings have been built in the Yuantouzhu area, they are all public property. The place where Engineer Xue and his wife are entertaining guests is called Shuiyun Tower, which is a newly built building funded by the Taihu Cement Company and owned by the government. The scenery is very beautiful from the top of the building. After a while, Jin Danyun and his wife arrived with many people. Among them, many people had been to Yuantouzhu in Wuxi before, but Mrs. Su Liya and the two Miss He were visiting for the first time. Engineer Xue and his wife were very hospitable, and Jin Danyun and Mrs. Xue met for the first time and were even more cordial. The dishes they are serving today are called Chinese food eaten Western-style. What does it mean to eat Chinese food Western-style? It turns out that all the food materials are Chinese products, and the cooking method is also Chinese, but Western-style knives and forks are also prepared. They knew that Mrs. Su Liya was there today, and she was not used to Chinese chopsticks. But in fact, they did not know that Mrs. Su Liya had long been sinicized. She often eats with Chinese chopsticks, unlike Europeans and Americans who have just arrived in China and cannot handle chopsticks well. The dishes can be separated for each guest, but they are cooked together. The essence of Chinese cooking is to put everything together, like a country, which should be unified, not divided. (273)

### An Englishman's Bird's-Eye View of Hollywood

— Xin Liang

George Arliss, a well-known British star in Hollywood, recently published an article in the American "Modern Historical Materials" titled "Hollywood—In the Eyes of an Englishman." He described his life in the film industry for the past ten years and the conditions in Hollywood in great detail, vividly and interestingly. The following is a translated excerpt of the original text:

"Of all the cities I've lived in, Hollywood is the most comfortable. Most of the men and women walking on the streets are related to film companies. Even a star walking on the street won't be surrounded, although strangers may suddenly approach to ask their name and say hello.

"My first impression of Hollywood was that it was vast—everywhere you look, there are small villages. There aren't many tall shops and hotels...

"Except for the surrounding mountains, almost all the beauty of Hollywood is man-made.

"I once met a famous stage actor named Joseph Jefferson. I asked him what his interest in acting was like when he was young, and he told me: 'Acting was really hard back then; putting a piece of red cloth on a soapbox and forcing you to sit on it like an emperor, can you imagine how difficult that was?' But now, in Hollywood, all the costumes, sets, and props are so realistic that even if you don't want to be an emperor, you'll naturally feel majestic.

Secondly, George Arliss also told us about the hardships of many Hollywood actors, saying:

"In a film set, you don't necessarily need to know how to cook, how to be a good wife or a mother, but you must learn to be patient. If you're an extra, you have to be in the makeup room at the film set by 7:30 in the morning to prepare for your first shot. Then, you have to wait, wait, and maybe wait until late at night before filming starts. The next day, you have to go there early to wait again. Even a big star, though they can come a little later, can't avoid waiting. Often, after putting on makeup, they have to wait a long time before filming starts. During this time, you can't write letters, you can't read the newspaper, and that's really exhausting!"

Finally, he also told us: the so-called blockbuster hits are usually good films in reality, and definitely not crudely made imitations of others.

Arliss is also writing a book called "My Ten Years at the Studios" to permanently record his history in the film industry. It will soon be published by the American Littell and Brown Company.

### Female Animal Tamer Chen Xiuying – Starred in the Film "Savage King" in Hong Kong

— Traveling Reporter

Wild beasts are fearsome, but to tame ferocious lions and tigers to be as docile as kittens and white rabbits can be seen in movies. Movies can often deceive and create illusions. However, in the circus, Miss Chen Xiuying's amazing skill of subduing tigers and taming elephants is performed live in front of millions of viewers.

Miss Chen is a Chinese overseas from Africa, 21 years old this year. She has been involved with the circus since she was a child. She has been performing for ten years since she was eleven. From Africa through East India to various parts of Southeast Asia, she and her seventy-odd companions in the troupe have wandered through hundreds of docks and more than a dozen countries in tents. Therefore, in addition to her animal taming skills, she can also speak seven different languages.

Four years ago, she learned the national language of her motherland very fluently and participated in many fundraisings for various just causes and good deeds for her motherland. She has had many opportunities to observe and study in circuses in Europe, especially taming lions and tigers, which are rarely seen among foreign women, let alone in China.

Her physique is quite healthy and her appearance is also very beautiful. According to her own words, she once filmed a Cantonese wild animal film "Savage King" for a film company in Hong Kong. Many film companies competed to sign long-term contracts with her, but the tent life of wandering has become too much of a love for her. Because she was reluctant to part with her companions of many years, she politely declined.

The African Circus came to Shanghai to perform this time. Due to acclimatization problems, they rested for a week during the opening. Now it is said that they will soon officially participate in the performance.

### Shirley Temple to Retire from the Screen

This publication previously reported that Shirley Temple would retire from the screen to go to school, which has been confirmed. A Reuters dispatch from Hollywood has reported this accurately. Shirley's mother said: I want Shirley to forget about movies for a few years. She has worked very hard and should enjoy herself from now on. Shirley Temple has been working on screen for seven years and is one of the highest-paid stars in Hollywood.

### Affection of Two Leading Actors

### Foreword to "The Wages of Sin"

— Qin

Who knew that Hedy Lamarr's seductiveness had an incredible magic. In the past blockbuster "Ecstasy", she had bold performances and erotic provocations that shocked movie fans around the world. "The Wages of Sin" is a representative work of her in Hollywood, and MGM has spared no effort to complete this masterpiece very solemnly.

In her recent works, the English she speaks cannot get rid of the vowels of her native language. But in "The Wages of Sin", she speaks fluent and pure English. This may be a miracle. She has only been in Hollywood for a short year, and she can speak so correctly. If it is not her special intelligence, how can she have such achievements? Not only that, but also in terms of expression and performance, she is exquisite and transparent. Whether it is facial lines, eye movements, or actions, she has very high achievements.

The entire plot undoubtedly touches everyone's heart, especially the sympathy of women. Hedy Lamarr is a woman who has been abandoned. She cannot withstand the oppression of material desires and carnal desires. She commits suicide. Fortunately, a doctor saved her life. In various encounters, she understands the greatness of true love. She abandons her social status and resolutely marries this doctor to do a work of compassion.

The male star who plays the doctor is Spencer Tracy, who starred in "Boys Town". This great artist who won the Academy Award for the Arts has a profound performance in the first time he performed love scenes, which shows his versatility and omnipotence.

The director is the famous Van Dyke, who has five years of stage experience and has been an assistant to the director giant Old Reifeis. Famous films such as "The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde", "Eskimo", "Marie Antoinette", "The Thin Man", and "The Gun Beneath the Sea" were all directed by him and left a lofty reputation.

The above three artists have cooperated to create "The Wages of Sin". At least, it can be said that satisfactory appreciation is an inevitable fact. Anyway, it will be released at the Grand China today, and let the movie fans chew on it themselves!

### Zhang Wenjuan's Future

— Plum Blossom House Owner

Kunling Xusheng Zhang Wenjuan is a student of my friend Ding Muqin, a painter. She has performed successively in the Chang'an and Times theaters in Shanghai, and her reputation is well-known throughout Shanghai, and she has the reputation of the second Meng Xiaodong for a while. However, Wenjuan was not complacent because of this. At the end of last year, she and her teacher Zhang Rongkui went north together, hoping to broaden her horizons and seek further education. Her ambition to be ambitious is worthy of praise. After arriving in Ping, under the introduction of Rongkui, she met with famous sages and famous actors in the ancient capital one after another, and met with people from all walks of life on the carpet in the New Year this year. Her new voice was first tried, and her momentum was still strong, and there were many words of encouragement in the newspapers, and the future was bright. The famous drama critic Mr. Zhang Zui Gai admired her even more, and poems and essays were presented to her and published in newspapers from time to time. How fortunate was Wenjuan to encounter this wonderful encounter? Recently, Gai Weng gave her a work praising Juan, titled "Zhang Wenjuan's Art Received from Master," which is extremely capable of rendering praise for this worm. The following are four new poems by him. The poems say:

"Liyuan is a place to live, I don't want to listen to Zheng and Wei's songs. I don't want to entertain myself in this year, and I worship famous actors in Shanghai. She doesn't apply powder and is proud of her beard and eyebrows. She steps onto the stage to perform. She plays the zither and sings loudly to relieve the blocks. The girl is smart and better than a man. Yiguan Youmeng Xi is on the stage, her attitude is dignified and generous. The mountains and rivers are uniquely endowed with spirituality, and Gusu is her old hometown (Wenjuan is Wu Ren). She searches for miscellaneous scripts to comfort her life, and she has worked hard for ten years to learn the art. She is willing to leave a new impression in Yanshi, and Wenjuan's name is A Nono."
