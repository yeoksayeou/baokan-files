Editorial

### An Analysis of Germany's Invasion of Northern Europe

President Roosevelt once said: "Aggression, like pestilence, is transmitted most rapidly." Since the September 18 Incident in 1931, the territory of sovereign states being occupied by force has been endless. In Europe alone, in the short span of the past two years, the map has completely changed for the four countries of Austria, Albania, Czechoslovakia, and Poland. Other countries that have lost territory and been humiliated include the three small Baltic states and Finland, which recently ended the war with painful concessions. Who knew that on the morning of April 9, 1940, Denmark and Norway in Northern Europe, which had been cautious and adhered to strict neutrality as their national policy, would also become the third or fourth batch of invaded countries under the beautiful name of "protection"?

Originally, since the outbreak of the war in Western Europe, the many powder kegs hidden in the European continent seemed to be preparing to explode. No one could say for sure where it would erupt first, but almost everyone felt that if peace could not be established quickly, the scourge of war would inevitably continue to expand. For example, in the past half year, not only Belgium and the Netherlands in Western Europe received frequent alarms, at least three or four times, but also the countries of Romania, Hungary, and Yugoslavia in Southeastern Europe were in constant danger and turmoil. Even the countries of the Near East felt uneasy. After the Finnish-Soviet peace, the general concern was still more focused on the Balkans, because from a military point of view, if Germany were to move in that direction, at least the intervention of the British and French allied forces would not come quickly, and therefore it would not be easy to achieve practical results. At that time, would Germany not gain more practical benefits with less effort? However, the reality was just the opposite. The tentacles of the German aggressors did not reach east, but north. Instead of using its "unparalleled mechanized troops in Europe" to rush into Hungary or Romania, which share borders, it sent its navy, which it knew was no match, to seize the Scandinavian Peninsula, which was easily attacked by the British and French allied forces. This cannot be said to be unexpected.

Of course, Hitler's every move was carefully calculated. There must be very important reasons why he did not seek development in the Balkans. According to the general explanation, this approach of temporarily maintaining the status quo in the Balkans seems to be the result of the conflicting interests of Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union. The reason is that Germany now dare not lose the two friendly countries of Italy and the Soviet Union, so it is unwilling to directly offend the interests of these two countries. Therefore, after the talks at the Brenner Pass and the contacts between Moscow and Berlin, Germany was willing to temporarily abandon Southeastern Europe and move its troops north.

However, we criticize Germany's actions from an objective standpoint and still feel that its invasion of Northern Europe was "unwise." Of course, Hitler hoped to occupy Denmark and Norway in one fell swoop, so that on the one hand, he could facilitate the supply of materials from Northern Europe and break the British and French blockade, and on the other hand, he could use the sea and air bases of Denmark and Norway to directly threaten Britain and France, thereby shaking the confidence of the Allied countries. However, in our view, these two goals may not necessarily be achieved.

First, Britain and France have always regarded respecting the neutrality of small countries as their national policy. Recently, because Germany has repeatedly abused the territorial waters of the neutral countries in Northern Europe, it has already decided to tighten the blockade. Now that Denmark and Norway have been invaded by Germany, the British and French allied forces not only do not have to worry about the neutrality of Northern Europe, but can instead use Germany's military action as an excuse to send troops to recover the lost territories for Denmark and Norway. In this way, tightening the blockade of the Northern European sea is of course more obligatory. At that time, Germany's Northern European shipping route may be completely cut off, and even the opportunity to use the Norwegian government to protest to Britain and France will be lost. Will the hope of facilitating Northern European supplies not be equal to empty talk?

Second, Germany's military action can indeed be considered agile and effective, able to control the entire territory of Denmark within 24 hours and send troops to land in most ports of Norway, truly demonstrating the momentum of breaking through bamboo. However, to put it bluntly, Germany can carry out this kind of surprise attack, and Britain and France can also do it. According to the latest news, although Germany has occupied many ports along the coast of Norway, the navies and air forces of Britain and France are joining forces with the Norwegian National Defense Army to counterattack. The outcome is still uncertain, but according to some reports, the British and French allied forces seem to be determined to effectively blockade the Northern European sea, ensuring that Germany cannot send reinforcements to the Norwegian front line. If this is achieved, then will the small number of German troops who landed in Norway the day before yesterday not become isolated and helpless? If Germany cannot quickly open a supply line from Sweden or other areas, will this isolated army not be annihilated soon? In this situation, Germany cannot directly threaten Britain and France, but on the contrary has fallen into the Allied forces' strategy of "luring the enemy out and annihilating them in a concentrated attack." Is this not very unwise?

But some people also say that Germany's actions are not as simple as they seem. Perhaps this is a strategic feint to the east while attacking in the west. It is nominally an advance to the north, but in reality, it still wants to attack to the west or seize to the east. Alternatively, it may have reached a tacit understanding with the Soviet Union, Italy, and even Japan, preparing to create a more chaotic situation so that everyone can fish in troubled waters. These speculations are of course possible, but we have no reason to believe them before there is concrete evidence. Strictly speaking, we feel that Germany's actions this time have a bit of a desperate gamble, just like the aggressor in the Far East - Japan - as if they are rushing around and eager to seek small victories to deceive their people, using all means and attempting to create a terrible situation to intimidate all of humanity! This kind of irrational behavior is like making a cocoon to trap oneself, like digging one's own grave! Leaving everything else aside, in terms of morality alone, will this act of forcibly occupying the territory of small countries without any reason not arouse greater revulsion in the entire civilized world?

President Roosevelt said: "Aggression is a pestilence." We might as well add: Aggression itself contains toxins, which not only poison others, but also poison the aggressor himself one day. The result of poisoning is the loss of reason and blind recklessness, the gradual loss of the power to control oneself, and the willingness to fall into the mire, to the point of being unable to extricate oneself. This principle should be deeply reflected upon by all the aggressor countries in the world. If they are still obsessed and do not wake up, then even someone as clever and alert as Hitler may inevitably have to eat his own bitter fruit one day. As for those below the gun, there is no need to say more.

### Churchill's Speech in the House of Commons: Determined to Fully Aid Norway; Britain Occupies the Danish Faroe Islands; Norway's Fallen Ports Not Yet Recovered

London: The House of Commons convened today to hear a speech by First Lord of the Admiralty, Churchill. Members of the diplomatic corps present included the ambassadors of Argentina, Brazil, the United States, Belgium, the Soviet Union, China, Spain, Poland, and the Netherlands; the ministers of Sweden, Yugoslavia, Finland, and Latvia; the first secretary of the Norwegian legation; and the chargés d'affaires of Ecuador and Bolivia. First Lord Churchill began speaking at 3:48 PM, stating that while we have not yet recovered Norway's fallen ports, we have occupied the Faroe Islands, which belong to Denmark (located between Iceland and Britain). Once Denmark regains its freedom, we will return them to that country. (Havas, 11th)

London: Today, the House of Commons was very crowded for First Lord Churchill's speech. Initial questions were nearly inaudible due to the noise, demonstrating that whenever significant events occur, the entire House is eager to learn the facts of the day. When Mr. Churchill rose to speak, he was greeted with cheers. At the beginning of his speech, Mr. Churchill stated that in reporting facts or presenting details, there may be minor errors, and he hoped that Members would forgive him.

German Army's Invasion of Denmark and Norway: Long-Planned. Mr. Churchill said: The tension and unnatural calm of the past few weeks were violently shattered on the morning of Monday. On that morning, the German army suddenly invaded both Norway and Denmark. This crime was, of course, long-planned and meticulously prepared, only waiting until the last week of March to launch. We have received intelligence that large German merchant ships are being converted into troop carriers, and countless smaller ships are berthed in ports along the Baltic Sea and the mouth of the Elbe River; this has been the case for months. But no one can say when they will be used, or to coerce which peaceful nation. Denmark, Norway, and Sweden all seemed to be in danger of sudden and barbaric attacks. One of the three countries would be chosen as the sacrificial victim, and when the first strike would occur remained a matter of pure speculation. The Nazi government is accustomed to constantly spreading various threats and deceptions through all available channels, relying on its personnel stationed in various neutral countries, including the bells of its consulates and embassies, (laughter from the audience) and any sympathizers and supporters it can find anywhere. (Cheers and laughter) I assure everyone that this is not specifically directed at any particular individual. All these countries have been subjected to threats. The German government is not bound by law and has no qualms of conscience. Its government officials clearly advocate attacking the weak and leaving the strong for later. Therefore, the smaller countries around it are in a state of great panic, as they still are now. Even those neutral countries that are trying their best to show goodwill to Germany and provide it with the greatest assistance cannot guarantee that the Germans will not launch a sudden and unreasonable attack, quickly overthrow their countries, and plunder all their assets. Therefore, these unfortunate countries are all uneasy, wondering who will be next. We now know that on the early morning of Monday, Norway and Denmark drew the unlucky numbers in this terrible lottery. Denmark had special reasons to fear, not only because it was Germany's closest and weakest neighbor, but also because it had recently signed an agreement with Germany guaranteeing it would not be disturbed. (Laughter) Denmark and both Britain and Germany were engaged in active commerce. The continuation of this trade during wartime was long anticipated by Germany and a special trade arrangement was agreed upon by the German and Danish governments to guarantee it. This clearly placed Denmark in a particularly dangerous position.

The Biggest Obstacle to Blocking Germany: The Norwegian Corridor

The unique shape of the Norwegian west coast forms a kind of corridor or shortcut, allowing the trade of neutral countries and various German ships to pass through the territorial waters of Norway and Sweden, avoiding the Allied blockade. The existence of this geographic and legal route of cover has been a great disadvantage to us, and a great benefit to Germany's efforts to break the Allied blockade. German warships come and go at will, German submarines take advantage of it, and German postal ships and merchant ships attempting to return to Germany from the open sea also follow this route of more than 800 miles. The biggest obstacle to blocking Germany is this Norwegian corridor; this was the case in the last war, and it is still the case in the current war.

The British Navy was forced to sit idly by and watch German and neutral ships transporting various contraband goods to Germany, which could have been stopped at any time, but because of the existence of international law, they were unwilling to violate it, while Germany, in this war, has done everything possible to despise international law, just as it did in the last war.

During the last war, when we were allied with the United States, the Allies suffered greatly because German submarines used this covered route as a base for their piratical activities. Therefore, the British, French, and American governments jointly requested the Norwegian government to lay mines in the territorial waters of this covered route to prevent German submarines from using the route to commit violence.

Since the outbreak of this war, the Admiralty naturally had to bring this modern and highly respected precedent to the attention of the British government, urging it to allow us to lay mines in Norwegian waters, forcing ships entering and leaving Germany to sail in the open sea, giving us the opportunity to subject them to contraband controls or to seize them as war prizes by the blockading fleet. But the government was extremely hesitant even about this technical violation of international law, fearing criticism. This was reasonable and proper. We tried to act in accordance with international law, but soon we gradually felt that if this route continued to be used, the Allies would suffer endlessly, and we watched week after week as ships sailed along this corridor, fully loaded with iron sand destined for Germany, to be used to make bullets to kill young British and French men in the 1941 war. It was truly unbearable. Therefore, we finally decided that the unease in our conscience had already caused us damage, but it could also win us glory. We cut off traffic on this route, forcing all ships to pass through the open sea. The British government announced the laying of minefields at dawn on Monday, taking all kinds of precautions to prevent neutral ships or lives from being slightly endangered, even taking into account enemy ships.

The Nazi government attempted to use our blockade of the Norwegian corridor as an excuse to attack Norway and Denmark, but we can undoubtedly prove that the German preparations began well over a month ago, and that the actual movements of its troops and ships began before the British and French laid the mines. The Germans apparently guessed that we would lay mines, but they did not expect it to happen so soon. Therefore, in the last week of March, the Germans decided to use the Norwegian corridor, sending empty ships carrying iron sand back home, fully loaded with military supplies, with German troops hidden below, so that when the order was given, they could occupy various strategically valuable ports along the Norwegian coast, and at the same time launch a long-prepared offensive to strike two innocent neutral countries that had assisted them in various ways. We express our deep sympathy to the people of Norway. (Cheers) We hear that Norway is now trapped in a dire dilemma. The emotions of the Norwegian people, like those of other small countries, lean towards the Allies. They endure their suffering with hopeless anger, for dozens of their ships have been sunk, and many of their sailors have been drowned.

They fully recognize that their future independence and freedom are linked to the victory of the Allies. They hoped until the last moment that their land and cities would not be ravaged by the German army, and that their freedom and lives would not be plundered by foreign aggressors. But this hope ultimately proved illusory. Nazi Germany has committed atrocities against a small and friendly nation. The Norwegian government and people are now taking up arms to defend their homes and country. (Cheers)

Only by Restoring the Freedom of the Norwegian People Can Peace Be Discussed. We will do everything in our power to help them. (Cheers) We will fight with them. Only by restoring their rights and freedom can peace be discussed. (Cheers) The vast, mountainous areas of Norway offer numerous strongholds for free people to hide and fight, enabling them to maintain long-term and fierce resistance against those who seek to conquer them. The fate of Norway serves as a warning to other neutral countries who naively believe that friendship with Germany, or German guarantees, or any kind of treaty with Germany, can afford them protection from aggression. Once Germany sees an advantage, it will turn ruthless. If the Norwegian government had not strictly enforced its neutrality to our disadvantage, and had not allowed its corridor to be used by Germany to carry out its conspiracies, and if the Norwegian government had established a relationship of mutual trust with us earlier, we would have had ample opportunity to assist them, and it would have been much easier than it is today. If these neutral countries had rejected the Allies from afar before being subjected to a planned German attack, it would be unfair to condemn the Allies for not providing practical assistance and protection. He believed that Norway's current plight was mainly due to its strict adherence to neutrality.

Mr. Churchill continued, saying that he believed there would inevitably be questions from some quarters about what the Navy was doing. He wished to explain the situation as fully as possible, both past and present, but he regretted that he could not disclose anything about the future and ongoing operations. About five weeks ago, the Home Fleet returned to Scapa Flow for rest, and from there set out to carry out operations. We have experienced continuous air raid alerts and several air raids, but we now have extremely powerful anti-aircraft positions, operating in conjunction with other defense methods, and we have agreed on excellent measures with the Royal Air Force and the Naval Air Arm, so that we have ample aircraft squadrons available for deployment at a great distance. During the first German air raid, a cruiser was hit in the stern, requiring several weeks of repair. Other than that, as of the time of this speech, no ship in Scapa Flow has been hit or damaged, and no target of military importance on shore has been hit by German aircraft. The number of injured is extremely small. According to our observations, the enemy is gradually becoming afraid of the power of the artillery when attacking Scapa Flow. This is not surprising, because the shore batteries, supplemented by the powerful artillery positions of the fleet, can be said to be the most powerful concentrated anti-aircraft fire in the world.

If these neutral countries had rejected the Allies from afar before being subjected to a planned German attack, it would be unfair to condemn the Allies for not providing practical assistance and protection. He believed that Norway's current plight was mainly due to its strict adherence to neutrality. (To be continued)

### National Political Council: Important Consequences

Chongqing: The recently concluded Fifth National Political Council had two most important results: (1) Chairman Chiang reiterated the government's determination to continue the war of resistance, as announced by Chairman Chiang in his closing remarks yesterday. This announcement, issued by the highest authority in the country, will automatically eliminate all rumors circulating at home and abroad about possible changes in the government's policies. (2) The motion to revise the draft constitution promulgated on May 5, 1936, has failed. There was also a proposal to establish a National Political Commission after the end of this session of the Political Council and before the convening of the National Assembly. This motion, after heated discussion, was also rejected. (Reuters, 11th)

### Price Suppression Bill Passed by the Political Council

Chongqing: The current problem of rising prices was given great importance by this session of the Political Council. There were more than ten proposals from the councilors, along with those submitted by the government, all hoping that the government would take emergency measures, strictly crack down on unscrupulous merchants' monopoly, hoarding and speculation, and also hoping to adjust the price control agencies and facilitate transportation. Based on the temporary motion of Councilor Yang Duanliu and 101 others, a special committee was organized to review the price issue, with the Fourth Review Committee as the center, and all councilors were free to participate in joint research, and the four ministers of Finance, Economy, Transportation, and Interior were invited to attend to explain, so as to have a thorough discussion. The special committee held several meetings, the discussion time was quite long, and submitted a review report to the General Assembly. On the 10th, the General Assembly resolved, in addition to sending the original case to the government, and attached many suggestions, the main points are recorded as follows: (1) Unite the highest authorities to form a strong control organization, and select an impartial and upright official to be given full power to preside over it. (2) The measures of finance and finance must pay attention to their impact on prices, actively promote the sale of public bonds, national construction savings, to absorb idle funds, and try to make the funds of commercial and local banks used for production. (3) Reduce redundant agencies, and stop construction projects unrelated to the war of resistance, and vigorously carry out the thrift movement, especially paying attention to the upper class in the cities. (4) Substantially increase loans for production projects, in addition to guaranteeing interest and tax exemption, a fixed period of protection should also be given. (5) Transportation agencies should try to transport the accumulated goods in various places, and the transportation of necessities should be subsidized by the government when necessary. As for the steps to stabilize prices, start with rice, flour, oil, salt, cotton, cotton yarn, cotton cloth, and coal, and then gradually include building materials and hardware materials. The government is also expected to instruct the price-controlled purchase and sale offices to purchase daily necessities and distribute them to consumer cooperatives for sale. In places where there are no consumer cooperatives, the government should be urged to establish them as soon as possible. After our government has implemented this, if there are still hoarders and speculators, they should be tried according to military law after being found out, and the government should select senior officials to supervise at any time, and those who disrupt the price and fail to implement the laws should be severely punished.

The gold reserves and securities of the Norwegian National Bank have all been transported from Oslo to a location deemed safe. Hambro continued to describe the military situation, stating that German warships were unable to reach Oslo, so German troops landed at Moss and Drøbak, carrying sixteen armored vehicles. The German troops advanced from Moss to the Ski station, and then from there to Oslo. The German troops landing in Bergen numbered 5,000, but they were intercepted not far from there. The Norwegian warship Norge sank a large German warship near Horten, believed to be the battlecruiser Gneisenau, as well as two smaller ships. Two German submarines have sunk.

Berlin: The German and Romanian governments have agreed that since the United Kingdom has attempted to obstruct navigation on the Danube River, there is a need to protect the Danube River and its navigation.

### British Foreign Secretary Explains Norway's Position, Britain and France Recognize Norway as Their Ally, Determined to Prevent Germany from Consolidating Its Power

London: British Foreign Secretary Halifax explained Norway's position at a banquet of the National Defense and Public Interest Committee yesterday, saying that although there are rumors that Germany is conducting negotiations to force the new Norwegian government to recognize the German occupation, the Allied powers will recognize Norway as their ally. Information from Norway is very brief, and news of other events in the North Atlantic is also scarce. The Allied governments will regard any negotiations between Germany and Norway as acts of coercion under force. Our determination to resist German tyranny against powerless Norway and our own resistance to Germany's expansion of power in the North Sea and the Atlantic will not be affected by this. Because Britain will never allow Germany to extend its power into the North Sea and the Atlantic. The strong British and French navies are currently cooperating in Norwegian territorial waters. Prime Minister Chamberlain will report to Parliament on Thursday on the progress of British and French military efforts to prevent Germany from consolidating its position in Norway. In his opinion, Germany's recent actions are due to internal weakness. However, in any case, this is a lesson for neutral countries who did not prepare for assistance and regretted it too late. The Allied powers were forced to lay mines and infringe on Norwegian neutrality, but the Allied methods are humane, unlike Germany's violence. Regarding Germany's claim that the destruction of the independence of the other two countries is reasonable retaliation, he knows that world opinion will not agree. The Foreign Secretary also mentioned the Anglo-French war agreement, saying that Britain and France are now working together for common welfare, not only in the colonies but also in the labor-management and education movements. If there had been a similar agreement in the last war, the history of the past twenty years would have been different. The conduct of the war depends on the ability of the volunteer forces to adapt to the work. All the energy of the 80 million people of Britain and France is focused on the final victory of the war. This great organizational structure will eventually prove to be irresistible. (Reuters, 11th)

### Three Goals of Anglo-French Military Action

London: According to well-informed sources, the Anglo-French military actions in Northern Europe currently have only two goals: (1) to destroy the German fleet currently in the waters off northern Norway (this fleet is the first to leave German ports since the outbreak of the European war); (2) to quickly recapture the Norwegian ports occupied by German troops and to completely eliminate all enemy supply and escort ships berthed in the ports; (3) to constantly try to intercept Germany's attempts to send new troops to Norway from the North Sea or the Kattegat Strait. In addition, the Anglo-French air forces have been working with the navies. British air force bases are only 300 kilometers from the coast of Norway, which is very convenient for scheduling. Not only that, but the Anglo-French army authorities will also send expeditionary forces to Norway to fight in the near future. If so, the German troops who have already landed will be unable to obtain foreign aid from the Atlantic or the North Sea. At that time, if Germany wants to send new troops to Norway, it will have to go through Sweden. (Havas, 10th)

### Burma Strengthens Defenses

### French Premier's Report on the Situation in Northern Europe

Paris - Premier Reynaud delivered a speech in the Chamber of Deputies this afternoon, reporting on the situation in Northern Europe. The gist of his remarks included: Germany will certainly wage a "war for iron ore" in the Scandinavian Peninsula. However, I dare to assert that the sole result will be that the country will be unable to obtain this iron ore, not only at present but also in the future. In short, Germany needs to acquire overseas steel to attack us. However, today that country is already surrounded. It has indeed been complacent in Denmark. As for Norway, it has encountered setbacks because it anticipated that the country would not resist. In essence, what it expected was the capitulation of Austria in 1938, but what it actually encountered was the brave resistance of Belgium in 1914. That is all. (Havas dispatch, 11th)

### German Aircraft Raid Scapa Flow at Night; Four Shot Down by British

London - The Admiralty, the Air Ministry, and the Ministry of Home Security jointly issued a communiqué stating that enemy aircraft repeatedly bombed northern Scotland last night. Two Heinkel aircraft were shot down in the Moray Firth while attacking a convoy, and another is believed to have been destroyed as well. Subsequently, a large formation of enemy aircraft launched a major attack on Scapa Flow. An alert was issued from 8:51 PM until 11:10 PM, during which enemy aircraft attacked in several waves, dropping multiple bombs on warships anchored at Stromness and Kirkwall, and strafing with machine guns. Only one person sustained minor injuries, and there was no other damage. British warships immediately opened fire with anti-aircraft guns, shooting down three enemy aircraft. Fighter aircraft also scrambled to intercept and shot down one aircraft. Two other aircraft also had numerous bullet holes in their fuselages and were heavily damaged, making it unlikely they could return to Germany. One enemy pilot parachuted down and was captured by sailors from a British destroyer. (Havas dispatch, 11th)

### Municipal Council Elections: Major Victory for the British-American Front; All British-American Candidates Elected; Two Japanese Candidates Elected, Rest Defeated; Chinese and Foreigners Alike Rejoice that the Status Quo of the Settlement is Preserved

The Municipal Council election continued yesterday morning. Although the work of the ballot counters and collectors at both locations was extremely tense, the order was orderly. The British-American united front did its best to fight against the Japanese side, and they all held optimistic and confident psychology. After the short-range handover of Jari, the voting procedures were completed as scheduled at 3 pm yesterday to determine the future position and destiny of the public species boundary. After the voting was closed at 3 pm yesterday, the ballot inspectors Brandeburg, Bellingert, and others sealed the ballot boxes tightly and escorted them to the Municipal Council Building under armed guard to count the votes. This was completed at around 3 am this morning. The results of the ballot counting and the general situation yesterday are recorded separately as follows:

Elected Directors: The results of the Municipal Council election votes were calculated at 3:30 this morning (12th) and announced by the Municipal Council Information Office. A total of:

Nine candidates were elected:

(1) Allman: 8,000 votes (2) Carnie

(3) Keize威: 7,883 votes (4) He萊

(5) Powell: 7,860 votes (6) Rotlic Macdonald

(7) Mitchell: 7,830 votes (8) Hagakawa Yūta

Four candidates were defeated:

(1) Gangben Yice: 5,203 votes (2) Kuroda Keita郎

(3) Gangben Yiyi (4) Reynolds Macdonald

Overall, seven British and American candidates and two Japanese candidates were elected.

As for the total number of valid ballots cast, there were 13,098, and 98 invalid ballots.

Total Number of Votes Exceeds Ten Thousand

According to the Japanese side, because the Japanese residents' voting qualifications were increased by 500 at the last minute, Japanese taxpayers could cast more than 4,000 votes in two days. Of these 4,000 votes, more than 3,200 votes had already been cast on the first day (because the Japanese election office issued more than 1,800 election certificates that day, and the Mitsui Bussan office issued more than 400 election certificates). The remaining approximately 700 votes could still be cast in full on the second day. The Japanese side estimated that the total number of votes this time would be more than 11,000. The British and American candidates had only secured the same number of votes as the Japanese in advance.

Ballot Boxes Concentrated and Guarded by Armed Forces

In view of the fierce competition in this election, the Municipal Council was sincerely afraid of conspiracies. In addition to strict security measures at the polling stations, the protection of the ballot boxes was also extremely thorough. For the past two days, the ballot boxes that had been cast in various locations were sealed with strict seals on the spot and escorted to the Municipal Council for safekeeping. Armed guards were on duty all night to avoid negligence and did not change shifts.

The Status Quo of the Settlement is Unchangeable

The reporter was deeply concerned that if the British-American united front was defeated by the Japanese side in this election, the administrative power of the settlement would be seized or controlled by the Japanese side from then on, and the status quo of the settlement would inevitably change. He visited a certain person in the settlement who had the most power and authority yesterday to inquire about his opinion. According to him, during the election, the Japanese side requested to increase the number of candidates to five, due to a long period of brewing and full preparation, using the special political influence of individual events, their strength should not be underestimated. However, in the event that the British-American united front is defeated by the Japanese side, the administrative management of the settlement will be seized or controlled by the Japanese side, and although the situation is worrying, it is not yet certain. Even if all the Japanese candidates are elected, if five of the nine Western directors are removed, the British and Americans will still occupy four seats, combined with the five Chinese directors, there will be a total of nine people. With nine against five, with the United States, China, and Britain to deal with these five Japanese directors, the Japanese side must occupy an advantage, and all administrative management facilities will still be decided by this majority. The Japanese side fundamentally has no way to indulge. When it came to this, the reporter asked a certain person, "Suppose the Japanese side uses various tricks to try to destroy the positions of the five Chinese directors after the election is announced, or proposes to include a bitter worker in the list of members, will this tripartite united front not be defeated?" A certain person replied with a solemn and firm attitude, "Millions of Chinese citizens in the city have already declared to China and abroad that they have decided to support the positions of the five Chinese directors in the previous session. If anyone opposes or destroys them, it is tantamount to challenging the masters of the settlement who enjoy sovereignty, and it is tantamount to challenging the most powerful people in the settlement. I think no one should be so foolish, and the British and Chinese ultimately have great interests in the settlement. The governments of both countries will never ignore the decline of the settlement. Even the Japanese still have concerns about the United States, and they may not dare to do whatever they want without restraint. Otherwise, millions of Chinese people would rather see the entire settlement destroyed than lightly give up their legitimate rights."

### Marshall's Warning Remarks Against the Japanese Army's Exclusion of the Rights and Interests of Third Countries; Monopolizing Everything Under the Pretext of Military Affairs; But Such Measures Will Inevitably Backfire

The British and Chinese Harmony Business Association held its annual meeting at its office at No. 17 Bund at 5:05 pm yesterday. Chairman Marshall delivered a speech on the spot, discussing the recent business situation of British expatriates under the so-called "influence of the New Order in East Asia." The attendees and the British Consul-General in Shanghai, Mr. George, were all moved by Marshall's alarming remarks. Marshall said,

Action Does Not Match Words: The policies currently adopted under the slogan of the "New Order in East Asia" are contrary to the principles of open doors and equal opportunity. It is difficult for us to imagine how significant an impact this policy will have on the Chinese people and foreign businessmen. The Japanese army's so-called difficulty in opening up business in the Yangtze River and Pearl River due to military relations is actually a deceptive talk. According to the current investigation, the issue of opening up all commercial ports and the Yangtze River and Pearl River is by no means hindered by military relations, but is actually due to the Japanese people not allowing foreigners to rebuild or restore the old state of these areas. The suffering currently suffered by the Chinese people in Shanghai, and the soaring prices caused by the inability to continuously transport various daily necessities to Shanghai, cannot be tolerated if their cause is said to be due to military relations. The root cause lies entirely in the various restrictions and heavy donations imposed by the Japanese army.

Backfire: But I dare to assert that the Japanese army's measures will inevitably backfire in the future. In this situation, it is impossible to gradually prosper the Japanese-occupied areas. The Japanese army has repeatedly stated that it is willing to respect the rights and interests of foreigners in China, but the situation in Tianjin, Yantai, Qingdao, Hankou, and other places is sufficient to prove that people have not implemented even one ten-thousandth of their promises. The Tianjin concession is still under blockade. British shipping in Qingdao is subject to great restrictions and blows. The arrogance of the "anti-British movement" in North China has increased unabated. But at this time, Japanese ships have almost monopolized all passenger and cargo transportation in various places, especially inland river shipping, which has been completely controlled by the Japanese. Taking the situation in Shanghai as an example, since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, almost all the wharves where foreign ships can dock are within the sphere of influence of the Japanese army. This loss is currently difficult to calculate.

Opinions on China: In addition, Mr. Marshall also expressed his views on the cooperation projects in southwest China. He believes that the products needed by China, the destination, can actually be self-sufficient. Transportation difficulties are inevitable, but if small factories are set up, the transportation problem will not be serious. He also believes that even after peace is achieved, these factories will still be in place. During China's military state, Mr. Li believes that the Japanese army is currently in a difficult situation. Although the Japanese side superficially occupies a very large area, due to the activities of guerrillas, the area they can rule is actually very small.

### The Responsibility the United States Should Bear in the Sino-Japanese War; Giving Tools to Thugs to Do Evil; If You Want to Remain Neutral, You Should Know How to Remedy It; Dr. Baker's Speech at the University in New York

The Continental Daily News reports that the Christian Science Monitor reports that Dr. Baker, the director of the China International Relief Association, recently gave a speech in New York criticizing the part of the responsibility that the United States bears in this Sino-Japanese War. He said that the duty of the United States lies in maintaining neutrality throughout the Sino-Japanese War. However, the United States has not been neutral except in technical aspects. The United States has given tools to thugs, thereby doing evil, and it still does so today. If we want to remain neutral, we must at least take some action to remedy the destruction caused by the tools we have supplied. Dr. Baker also urged the United States to maintain its missionary work in China, saying that the American missionaries in China have adhered to the true Christian spirit in this war, being in danger, not leaving their posts, and making great sacrifices to preserve the cause established by their predecessors in the Far East. If the church in China is forced not to receive assistance, the Christian cause established in China in the previous century and its current work will be threatened. Dr. Baker finally urged the United States to stop supplying weapons to Japan.

### Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau Recruiting Bureau Members

### Czech Woman Abducted by Three Japanese in Hongkou Yesterday; Released Only in the Afternoon with Eye and Leg Injuries; Rumored to be Related to This Year's Board Election; Puppet Police Make Things Difficult for British Women; Japanese Soldiers Intimidate Young Girls

The English-language Great American Evening Post reports that Japanese and police under Japanese protection have kidnapped a Czech woman and stopped a British woman driving a car in the past 24 hours, and attempted to stab two British girls with guns. The details are recorded as follows:

Czech Girl Suddenly Kidnapped

Miss Silk, a Czech girl, lives in Riverside Mansion. At 10:30 this morning (11th), she was talking to several immigrants on the sidewalk on Peng Road near the Hongkou vegetable market. Suddenly, a car with license plate number 4067 drove up beside her. Three Japanese jumped out of the car, grabbed Miss Silk rudely, dragged her into the car, and then sped off towards Yangshupu. A few minutes later, someone saw the car speeding along Huade Road, and Silk was struggling desperately in the car. Her sharp screams attracted the attention of pedestrians in the area. It is believed that the motive for the kidnapping may be related to the Municipal Council affairs election. The Japanese may believe that Silk advised immigrants not to elect Japanese candidates to the polling station. According to a follow-up report from this newspaper at midnight yesterday, the Czech girl, Silk, had already returned home at about 4:00 pm. Both eyes and legs were seriously injured, with bruises on her eyes and tooth marks on her cheeks. After she reported the details to the police station, she went to a doctor for treatment.

British Woman Driving Car with Puppet Police Making Things Difficult

At 11:00 am, Mrs. Dean, a British woman, was driving her car in front of Yiding Road when she collided with a bicycle. As soon as the road was repaired, the Dadao police arrived at the scene and forced Mrs. Dean to go to the Dadao Police Station. Mrs. Dean then drove to the front of the British sentry post at the nearby Yiyu Road intersection to seek protection. Major Hunter, a British officer who was good at speaking Japanese, arrived at the scene and immediately called the Jing'an Temple Police Station and the Japanese Gendarmerie on Jessefield Road. The Jing'an Temple Police Station sent someone to the scene and saw that it was a minor incident. Mrs. Dean drove to the Jing'an Temple Police Station to report. At that time, the settlement police and a certain military unit were present. Several Dadao police officers jumped onto the footboard of Mrs. Dean's car in a menacing manner. However, after Special Officer Te sent a telephone call to the Japanese gendarmerie, an officer of the Dadao police heard the news and rushed to the scene and ordered the Dadao police to withdraw. Mrs. Dean was then able to drive to the Jing'an Temple Police Station to report. Major Hunter then made a verbal protest to the Japanese authorities about the matter.

Japanese Soldiers Threaten British Girl with Guns

Also, Sarine Hai, the daughter of Mr. Hai, a British man from the power company, was walking along Yangshupu Road with her friend from the Central Asian country at 4 pm yesterday, taking several photos of each other. Suddenly, four Japanese soldiers (not the marine landing team) ran near the Dinghai Road Bridge with rifles and bayonets, shocking the woman, who took refuge in the Mobil Oil Company building. Miss Hai called her father. A few minutes later, Mr. Hai arrived and saw the Japanese soldiers waiting outside the door. The two sides argued for half an hour on the settlement road in the Japanese Marine Corps defense zone. Mr. Hai decided to hand over the camera. The Japanese soldiers took out the film and returned the camera. The matter ended.

### American Radio Station Disturbed; Japan Has Not Found the Source; Claiming That They Must First Obtain Definite Facts; American Radio Station Disturbed More Severely Than Before for Several Days

The Continental Daily News reports that the British merchant Wuzhan Radio Station (call sign XMHA) has been negotiating with the Japanese Ministry of Finance because its Lebo was disturbed. The Japanese side officially announced yesterday (10th) that it had not found the source of the disturbance, but the radio station's radio waves were disturbed even more yesterday. A spokesman for the Japanese Embassy claimed at a press conference yesterday that the American Acting Consul-General in Shanghai, Mr. Burtlick, and the radio station manager, Mr. Hailey, visited Japanese Consul-General Sanura yesterday afternoon. According to Miura, he said that he must first obtain "definite facts" before taking steps. XMHA Radio Station changed its wavelength due to disturbances, but the new wavelength happened to be the radio wave of a certain Japanese radio station that has existed for a long time.

### International Labor Conference Consults Representative Candidates

This Year's Maritime Representative May Be Appointed by the Central Government

The 26th International Labor Conference is scheduled to open in Geneva on June 6. The International Labor Office has informed the Chinese Branch to solicit candidates for the Chinese delegation to attend the conference from the government, employers, and labor unions, as well as maritime representatives. The China General Association of Industry and Commerce and the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce of the Republic of China have decided to gather in Geneva to discuss and elect representatives, consultants, and secretaries from the employer delegation, as well as to propose funds for early telegrams to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for appointment. As for the labor delegation and the government delegation, they will be appointed by the Central Government. As for maritime representatives, the previous Tian Chinese Seafarers' Special Party Department and the Chinese Seamen's Union elected this year or will be appointed by the Central Government.

### Aluminum Auxiliary Coins; The Second Batch Has Also Arrived in Shanghai; A Total of 10 Million Coins, Half One Cent and Half Five Cent Coins; It is Decided to Issue It Immediately After the First Batch is Issued

After the Shanghai Banking Association submitted an application to the Ministry of Finance to issue one-cent and five-cent aluminum auxiliary coins, the first batch has been transferred to various banks and money shops by the Bank Preparation Committee, the Money Industry Preparation Bank, and the British HSBC Bank, and has been circulating in the Shanghai market, which citizens call convenient and harmonious. Yesterday, it was learned that the second batch of 10 million coins, half one-cent and half five-cent coins, namely 50,000 yuan for one-cent coins and 250,000 yuan for five-cent coins, has now arrived in Shanghai. It has been decided to issue it immediately after the first batch has been issued.

### Postage Increase; Approved by Both Houses

Implementation is Only a Matter of Time; Not Related to the Fiscal Year

Regarding the domestic postage increase, a reporter from Datong News Agency learned from the responsible party of the Shanghai Postal Administration that it has been determined and approved by the Executive Yuan and the Legislative Yuan, so it is only a matter of time. Outsiders do not understand the postal situation and say that the postage increase must be implemented with the fiscal year, which is not true. The last price increase was on May 1, 1932, when post offices across the country began to increase prices, but the Shanghai Post Office delayed it until May 30. Therefore, knowing the above facts, we know that the statement that the price increase must follow the fiscal year is purely speculation.

### American Giant Protection Ship; It is Said to Arrive in Shanghai Tomorrow; There are Also Four Submarines Coming with It; It is Expected That Other Ships Will Continue to Sail East

The Continental Daily News reports that it is widely rumored in Pingshi that the American submarine protection ship USS Canopus and four submarines are about to arrive in Shanghai from the south. Although there is no official news, it is reliably believed that the ship and submarines may arrive here on Saturday or Sunday. The general public believes that the annual spring cruise of the US Navy off the coast of China will not be held this year. However, if the submarines and the USS Canopus sail to Shanghai, it is expected that other warships will follow.

American Transport Ship Arrives in Shanghai in September

The Chinese-Western Newspaper also reports that the US Navy transport ship USS Wharton, with a deadweight of 13,788 tons, will cross the Pacific for the first time this summer and arrive in Shanghai around September. At that time, the ship will be the largest American warship docked in the Huangpu River, because the deadweight of the USS Augusta is only 10,000 tons, and the deadweight of the USS Henderson is only 10,500 tons. The USS Wharton was previously the Southern Cross of the American Republican Shipping Company and was purchased by the US Navy last year and converted into a transport ship, named after Lieutenant Colonel Wharton, the second commander of the US Marine Corps.

Another New Ship Converted into a Transport Ship

The USS Santa Clara, also purchased by the US Navy from the Grace Shipping Company, has also been converted into a transport ship, named after Lieutenant Colonel Burroughs, the first commander of the US Marine Corps, named the USS Burroughs. The ship has a deadweight of 4,576 tons and may not be dispatched to the Pacific. It may sail between the east and west coasts of the United States with the USS Chaumont, which has withdrawn from the East, while leaving the USS Wharton and USS Henderson to sail in the Pacific. According to unconfirmed reports from naval circles in this city, although the USS Chaumont has withdrawn from the Pacific at the beginning of this year, it has been designated to sail to the East again once and is expected to arrive in Shanghai before September, and then return to the United States.

USS Henderson Brings Defense Force

The USS Henderson transport ship will arrive in Wusong on or about May 1, and it is estimated that it will carry about 300 soldiers who will join the US Fourth Marine Regiment stationed in Shanghai, as well as hundreds of Navy and Marine Corps soldiers dispatched to various ships of the Asian Fleet. At the time, two companies of the Fourth Marine Regiment will leave Shanghai on the USS Henderson to train in Qinhuangdao, and about 270 Marine Corps soldiers whose terms of service in Shanghai have expired will take the USS Henderson back to the United States on its return trip south.

### The American Overseas Chinese Association of This City; Five People Have Completed Their Terms and Are Being Re-elected

### Danish Merchant Ships on the Far East Line Awaiting Orders, Jebsen's Two Ships Likely Unable to Leave Chinese Waters, Norwegian Ships Temporarily Continuing Operations Unaffected

Recently, the European situation has suddenly become tense. The entire territory of Denmark has been controlled by the German army. Denmark is unable to resist and has acquiesced. Therefore, Danish overseas commerce is facing the same fate as German commerce and is likely to be suspended. Danish merchants in this city are currently observing and awaiting news from their consulate. According to sources in the shipping industry:

Danish shipping companies in this city are represented by only one firm, Jebsen & Co., and it is only a branch office. The head office is in Hong Kong. Apart from the ships operating on the Nanyang (Southeast Asia) route from Hong Kong, the branch office in this city only has two ships. One is the Machae Jebsen, with a deadweight of over 3,000 tons, and the other is the Gustav Diederichsen, with a deadweight of over 3,500 tons, operating on

China's coastal ports, represented by shipping companies such as Tong Wai Kee and Chap Seng. The Machae Jebsen loaded over 20,000 bags of foreign rice and corn in Shanghai on Monday this week (the 8th) to be transported to Yantai. The Gustav Diederichsen was originally scheduled to load miscellaneous grains in Shanghai today to sail to Longkou. However, due to the impact of the European situation, it was unable to leave today and is waiting for orders from the Hong Kong head office before deciding on its next course of action. The Machae Jebsen has now arrived in Yantai, and even if the cargo is unloaded, it is feared that it will not be able to go elsewhere and must obtain orders before leaving Yantai. According to related sources, the two ships can only temporarily dock in Shanghai and Yantai. Leaving Chinese ports would be even more dangerous. As for

Norwegian ships, there are also many rumors circulating about their future. According to a report from the Datong News Agency, the Hong Kong authorities have blocked ____. The Sksagkes, a fast ship of the Norwegian firm Shun Heng, is scheduled to sail from Shanghai to Hong Kong tomorrow (the 13th). Furthermore, the ships of Hua Lun & Co. operating on the Shanghai-Ningbo line are also operating as usual.

### Yunfei and Other Car Companies' Wage Dispute Resolved, Car Rental Prices Increased from Tomorrow, 2.7 Yuan Per 20 Minutes

The drivers of Yunfei, Xiangsheng, Tailai, Yinse (Silver), and 40-Day car companies previously had a labor dispute over wage issues, which was well-known in society. After several rounds of mediation by Gu Bingyuan of the Industry Section of the Municipal Council, these companies have increased the wages and rice subsidies for the drivers as much as possible starting this month, and the storm has been calmed. This is fortunate for both parties. According to the companies, the purchase price of new cars is now expensive, and gasoline and spare parts have also increased in price. It has been decided to increase car rental prices to 2.7 yuan per 20 minutes starting on Saturday, the 13th of this month. The companies originally planned to implement the rent increase earlier, but because of the labor dispute ____. It is hoped that all sectors of society will not misunderstand. Although the wages of the drivers, etc., have been increased as much as possible, there is still a risk of being stretched thin under the current cost of living. It is hoped that the drivers will work diligently and that customers will frequently patronize them, so that both parties can benefit.

### Travel Industry's Additional Tax Implemented, Allowed to be Reduced at Any Time, Association Notifies Members to Pay with Resignation

Regarding the Municipal Council's increase in license tax for Chinese-style apartments, it has replied to the Shanghai Travel Industry Association. After receiving the letter, the association immediately notified all members in the Public Concession, stating, "Regarding the notification, the Municipal Council has notified us that our fellow businesses (Chinese-style apartments) will be subject to a large increase in business license tax starting this summer. This association, considering the vital interests of our fellow businesses, has not only strongly argued with the Municipal Council but also sent letters to the Ratepayers' Meeting and the Chinese Councillors for assistance in reducing the burden. Subsequently, the Chinese Councillors investigated the Municipal Council's files and the reasons for this tax increase. According to ____ in the autumn of ____, the increase was already scheduled (approximately 70 to 50 percent). At that time, due to the sharp decline in business after the January 28th Shanghai Incident, coupled with the efforts of this association, the increase was reduced by half. However, it was stipulated that the full amount would still have to be paid in the 23rd year. Now, seven or eight years have passed. While the business of our fellow businesses has slightly improved, the Municipal Council's expenditures have increased daily, and its debt is piling up, making it impossible to reduce the tax. Recently, we received a letter from the Municipal Council stating, 'Your association's suggestion that the tax rate should be considered for reduction if business declines in the future is particularly appreciated.' After deliberation, the association believes that since the Municipal Council has agreed to consider reducing the tax rate in the event of business decline, it is still reasonable. We urge all fellow businesses to temporarily endure the pain and pay the tax according to the rate notified by the Municipal Council from now on. Do not ____."

### Jianghai Customs Complies with Ministry Order, Issues Wartime Allowance

All tax police officers of Jiang ____ Customs previously submitted a joint request to the authorities, requesting an allowance during this extraordinary period due to the difficulty of making a living. The Ministry of Finance then telegraphed the Shanghai Customs to approve the request and increase the allowance appropriately. Now, in order to take care of the livelihoods of customs officers across the country, the Ministry of Finance has telegraphed all customs offices to issue a "wartime allowance" of 40 percent, which will be applied to all customs officers and police. It is understood that this allowance will be issued by Jianghai Customs on the 25th of this month. Those who receive a monthly salary of 100 yuan will receive an allowance of 40 yuan. Those above 100 yuan will receive 35 yuan, those above 200 yuan will receive 30 yuan, those above 300 yuan will receive 25 yuan, those above 400 yuan will receive 20 yuan, and those above 500 yuan will receive 15 yuan. The rest will be calculated accordingly.

### Fourth Phase of Price Stabilization Rice Sale to be Held in Two Weeks

After the Shanghai Price Stabilization Rice Committee decided to continue with the fourth phase of price stabilization rice sales at its tenth meeting, the committee scheduled another regular meeting at 3 PM tomorrow to discuss raising funds and finalizing the previous three phases of price stabilization rice sales. The date for the continuation of the price stabilization rice sales will be in two weeks, as various procedures need to be completed within this period. Regarding the fundraising method, it will be the same as the previous session, and various associations in this city will be convened again to solicit donations.

### German and Italian Restrictions Very Strict, Prohibiting Cash from Leaving the Country, Overseas Chinese Trying to Transfer Funds, Exchange Rates High, Heavy Losses

Overseas Chinese returning from Europe have been unable to bring their savings out of the country since the outbreak of the European war, as governments in various countries have restricted overseas Chinese from carrying silver out of the country. According to returning overseas Chinese, most of those affected by the European war and returning to the country are from France, Germany, and Italy. Before the war, Germany and Italy had very strict restrictions on any overseas Chinese carrying silver out of the country. Germany only allowed each person to carry ____ marks. After the war, due to the control of wartime finance, the carrying of silver coins out of the country was prohibited. The same was true for Italy. Therefore, overseas Chinese returning after the war were unable to carry any expenses other than for the fare. The French government allowed each person to carry 500 francs, equivalent to just over 150 yuan in national currency. Recently, customs officials in Marseille have been conducting stricter checks on departing passengers, and even small items must be opened and examined to prevent money from being smuggled out. Furthermore, overseas Chinese are prohibited from purchasing remittances. Overseas Chinese residing in France, Germany, and Italy fear that the war will escalate and that their savings will become even more difficult to withdraw. They are all transferring their funds to countries such as Britain and Belgium in order to remit them back to the country at any time. However, the exchange rates are quite high, resulting in heavy losses.

### The Case of the Hidden Shareholder of Lao Zheng He, The Court Rules That There Are Indeed Share Rights, The Defendant Is Convicted of Perjury and Given a Suspended Sentence

Xu Huijun from Shaoxing, residing at No. 5, Lane 31, Shanxi Road, worked at Lao Zheng He Dye Shop at No. 191, Rue Edward VII. In the fifth year of the Republic of China, the former shareholder of the dye shop was unwilling to continue operating it. Lu Tingjian, Wu Zhihua, and Wu Rongquan formed a partnership to take it over and issue shares. At that time, each partner contributed 1,000 yuan of capital. Because Lu's capital was insufficient, he invited Xu, Jiang Shangxian, and Xu Baochun to join Lu's name as hidden partners. After Lu took over the dye shop, there were annual surpluses. By the 20th year of the Republic of China, the capital had expanded to ____ yuan. Xu's attached 200 yuan

Hidden Share Rights

also increased to 2,000 yuan. However, the three apparent shareholders had been friends for many years and had not yet reached an agreement. Therefore, Xu and Lu had not signed a separate agreement. However, Lu was honest and trustworthy and paid Xu's dividends and bonuses over the years. Unexpectedly, Lu died of illness on the Mid-Autumn Festival of the 27th year. Lu's wife, Sun, and son, Yongnian, denied that Xu had hidden share rights. Xu then hired lawyers Yu Zhongluo, Shi Lin, and Chen Kunyuan to file a lawsuit in the civil court of the Second Special Court against Lu's wife and son, seeking confirmation of his share rights. The two defendants hired lawyer Gao Danhua to defend them,

Presenting Stock Certificates

stating that if the plaintiff did not have stock certificates, they could not be recognized as having hidden share rights. As a result, Judge Ma ruled, "Xu Huijun's hidden share rights under Lu Tingjian's name in Lao Zheng He Dye Shop are confirmed as two-tenths." However, Xu discovered while reviewing the files in this case that the stock certificates submitted by the two defendants were forged in collusion with their relative Jiang Shangxian (Yongnian's father-in-law). He immediately reported this information to the French Concession Police Department. After investigation by the head of the detective team, it was confirmed that the information was true. A

Forgery of Documents

public prosecution was filed against Lu Sun, Yongnian, and Jiang Shangxian in the Criminal Court. In the first instance, Judge Liao ruled that all three defendants were not guilty. The administrative authorities of the French Concession refused to accept the verdict and appealed to the Criminal Court of the Third Branch of the High Court. Yesterday morning, Judge Wu, together with Judges Chen and Gu, concluded the trial and overturned the original verdict. Lu Sun and Lu Yongnian were each sentenced to two months of imprisonment for jointly forging private documents. Jiang Shangxian was sentenced to two months of imprisonment for perjury, all with a two-year suspended sentence.

### Arranged Marriage Reaches Stalemate, Matchmaker Sues for Advances, Proxy Handles Wedding Ring, Bride Refuses to Pay

He Jingyuan, the owner of the Dongfang Beauty Art Gallery at No. ____69, Jing'an Temple Road, arranged for his daughter, Xingzhi, to marry the son of Jin Baozhi, a wealthy businessman from Yangzhou, through the introduction of Jin Keqing (manager of the Wu Gong Hotel) and Zhang Shouzhi on November 26th of last year. However, when the wedding date arrived, the matchmaker Zhang Shouzhi was far away in Jiangdu and unable to come, so he entrusted Liu Fenggao (owner of Bao Yung Ko Antique Gallery at No. 59, Jiangxi Road), the brother-in-law of He, to act as a proxy matchmaker. Because the wedding ring was not prepared at the time of the wedding, He asked Liu to handle it on his behalf. Liu then purchased a gold ring from Qiu Tianbao Silver Shop for 82.7 yuan. Later, on the wedding day, He Jingyuan haggled over the wedding gifts, clothing, and a 20,000 yuan post-wedding guarantee, refusing to let the bridal sedan proceed. Despite the mediation of matchmaker Jin Keqing and proxy matchmaker Liu Fenggao, He insisted on not giving in, while Jin Baozhi's side refused, claiming that the post-wedding guarantee was an unprecedented idea. This led to a stalemate. At that time, Liu made some unpleasant remarks, resulting in animosity between the brothers-in-law. As a result, He refused to pay the 82.7 yuan for the wedding ring advanced by Liu. Despite repeated requests, he refused to pay. Liu had no choice but to hire lawyer Sun Deji to file a lawsuit in the First Special Court against He, seeking recovery of the debt. Yesterday, Judge Gui Yu opened the court for trial and ordered a postponement for further hearing.

### Major Fire by Suzhou Creek Yesterday, Cotton Warehouses Burned Down, Losses Exceed One Million Yuan

Gu Tiansheng Cotton Ginning Mill and Tianxiang Cotton Packing Factory, located at Nos. 2 to 30, Lane 1086, North Chengdu Road, along the Suzhou Creek in the Public Concession, were both owned by Gu Yongfu (62 years old) from Peidong. The factory had been in operation for many years. Because there was a large amount of cotton, it was insufficient to store it. Therefore, the company rented two large warehouses from Siemens nearby as storage warehouses. Unexpectedly, at 4 PM yesterday, a fire suddenly broke out on the second floor of the warehouses. In an instant, fierce flames soared into the sky, and the fire was raging, breaking through the roof and becoming uncontrollable. Although it was daytime, the fire was very bright. Because cotton is easily flammable, despite the efforts of Chinese and foreign firefighters to put out the fire, it was to no avail. The fire was not extinguished until midnight. When the fire was raging, the factory owner, Gu Yongfu, was so angry that he wanted to jump into the fire, but he was stopped by the workers. According to investigations, the loss of goods and buildings this time is estimated at 1 to 2 million yuan. It is reported that all of them are insured against fire. The factory suffered a fire last year, which also resulted in significant losses. Fortunately, the adjacent Changcheng Paper Mill was not affected. When the fire spread, the audience along the river on Guangfu Road in the Chinese Concession across the bank was like a wall. The Japanese Marine Corps specially dispatched troops and police with live ammunition to suppress the area near the Xinzha Road Bridge facing west, fearing an accident. The cause of the fire has not yet been determined.

### Dance Hall Manager Seriously Injured in Assault

Sun Kangnian, 34 years old from Ningbo, is the manager of the Hong Kong Dance Hall in the Guangzhou Hotel on Hankou Road. At around 3 PM yesterday, he took Wu Mengdie, a dancer who had returned to Shanghai from the Xinsanhai Defense, to the Yangtze Hotel. He happened to meet his friend Chen Fuzi (formerly an inspector at the Dahua Dance Hall). Sun immediately went up to greet him, but Chen ignored him, which led to a quarrel. Shortly after, Chen went out and gathered several people who grabbed Kangnian and beat him severely, using weapons to break his right leg. The assailants then scattered. The injured man was taken to Tongren Hospital for treatment.

### Blackmailing Merchants, Two Criminals Arrested and Punished

Sun Xinian, 22 years old from Jiangsu, was previously engaged in cotton yarn business. Therefore, he was familiar with the yarn industry and people in the "Consolidated Tax Bureau" on Jiujiang Road. After the outbreak of the war, Chinese industries were severely hit, allowing Japanese goods to take the opportunity to infiltrate and flood the market, especially cotton yarn. Because it was not easy to sell in the interior, it was mostly disguised, using the brand names of Chinese manufacturers to deceive customs and transport. Many yarn companies in Shanghai specialized in this business. Sun Xinian took advantage of the opportunity to blackmail these businesses. Last month, Sun blackmailed Bailey Cotton Yarn Company in the Hadong Building on Nanjing Road, initially demanding 1,000 yuan, which was later reduced to 500 yuan. He arranged to meet at Guanshengyuan on Nanjing Road on March 30th. Bailey reported this to the Laozha Police Station, which dispatched detective Shan Zhaoxian to wait. When Sun arrived, he engaged in negotiations, first handing over 200 yuan, promising to pay the remaining amount later. He then handed over 200 yuan in marked banknotes. When Sun received the money, he was arrested. His accomplice Dai Xianfang was also arrested. They were escorted to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday morning, the court continued the interrogation. The police lawyer Peng Qiqi filed a lawsuit according to the law, stating that the defendants had committed many such acts, but the victims were unwilling to cause trouble, so they did not participate in the lawsuit. When questioned, the defendants evaded their guilt and hired a lawyer to defend them. Judge Dai reviewed the confession and sentenced Sun and Dai to six months of imprisonment each, with a three-year suspended sentence.

### The Case of the Driver of a French Electric Company Killing a Primary School Student, Re-Examination Pending After Case File is Obtained

When he reached the intersection of ____ Ximen Road, Zhou Zuomin, a student from Fuchun Primary School at No. 1, Lane 157, Luban Road (12 years old, residing at No. 24, Xinmin Village, Malang Road), suddenly crossed the road. Peng was unable to brake in time and hit Zhou, causing serious injuries to his head and brain. He was immediately taken to Guangci Hospital for treatment, but he died in the afternoon due to his injuries. Yesterday afternoon, the police escorted Peng to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special Court for trial. Police lawyer Gu Shouxi filed a lawsuit under Article 272, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law, and requested the court to deal with the matter according to the law, as the brakes of the defendant's car were damaged and not repaired. The deceased's mother appeared in court. The court stated that the case file from the forensic doctor needed to be obtained before further hearing, and the hearing was postponed to the afternoon of the 16th. The defendant was not allowed bail.

### Punishment for Trademark Infringement

Zhu Junfu from Hubei, the owner of Kangcheng Winery at No. 107, Rue du Consulat, hired lawyer Lin Yingqing to report to the Laozha Police Station, accusing Fan Chengyu from Suzhou, an associate of Xilin Printing House on Zhejiang Road, of colluding with Wu Ruiyuan, who had already been arrested and sentenced to six months of imprisonment in Xianggang, of infringing on the trademark of Kangcheng Winery ____. The Laozha Police Station dispatched detectives to arrest Fan at his address and escort him to the First Special Court. Lawyer Lin stated that Kangcheng Winery had been established for 30 years and enjoyed a high reputation. The defendants should not have counterfeited the trademark, using shoddy products to deceive consumers, and requested a strict investigation. The case was heard yesterday morning by Judge Pei in the Eighth Criminal Court. After questioning, it was decided to sentence Fan Chengyu to four months of imprisonment to serve as a warning. The attached civil suit, claiming damages of 1,500 yuan, was transferred to the Civil Court of this court for trial.

### 190,000 Yuan Heist, Car Found on Lan Road, Robbers Apparently Had Planned Action

Ji Xiangqing, the manager of Huiyuan Bank at No. 94, Ningbo Road in this city, brought 196,000 yuan in cash from Wuxi on the 9th, packed in two leather suitcases, and took the Shanghai-Nanjing train to Shanghai.

The Police Headquarters then returned the car to the Annai Office. The Police Department is now conducting a strict investigation of the case, believing that the case is by no means an ordinary robbery case and must be a planned action, as Huiyuan Bank has been transporting funds to Shanghai by train several times a month, which has aroused the covetousness of bandits.

### Black Man Trademark Lawsuit, Jiuda Factory Sues Jianxing Factory

Liu Qingxuan from Beiping, 33 years old, residing in San Sheng Quan Shen Zhuang, Yuantai Lane, Shandong Road, recently hired lawyer Wu Xiangxian to file a self-accusation with the Criminal Court of the Second Special Court against Chen Dafu (residing at No. 10, Shungui Lane, Rue du Père Huc, who runs the Jianxing Weaving Factory) for obstructing agriculture, industry, and commerce. His statement of complaint briefly states: "The plaintiff established the Jiuda Weaving Factory on Jiaozhou Road, producing various silk and wool socks with the Black Man trademark, which are sold in various provinces of China and enjoy a long-standing reputation. The Black Man trademark has also been approved for registration by the Trademark Bureau and a registration certificate has been obtained. However, the defendant counterfeited the same Black Man trademark and used it on the same type of goods, selling them for profit, which clearly violates the provisions of Article 253 of the Criminal Law. Please punish the defendant according to the law and attach a civil suit, ordering the defendant to compensate for 106,820 yuan in damages." The court accepted the statement and heard the case yesterday morning by Judge Zhu Chuzhe. The defendant hired lawyer Ma Nangeng to defend him, stating that although the Black Man trademark had been used by the defendant, it had been abandoned for a long time, so it could not be said to have infringed on the plaintiff's interests. The court interrogated them and adjourned the hearing to the 18th. The defendant was ordered to provide a guarantor to ensure his presence when summoned.

### Ministry of Education Orders Provinces and Cities to Draft Guidelines for Instructing Graduates of Normal Schools

(Chongqing, 11th) The Ministry of Education believes that how graduates of normal schools in various provinces and cities should serve after graduation urgently needs guidance from educational administrative organs in order to achieve practical results. The Ministry has recently ordered the education departments of various provinces and the Social Affairs Bureau of Chongqing City to draft guidelines for instructing graduates of normal schools within a limited time and submit them for review and implementation.

### Central Organization Assigns Personnel to Inspect School Party Affairs; Minister Chu Discusses Education and the Mission of Academia

(Chongqing Air Mail) The Central Organization Department will invite several figures from the education and academic circles to inspect school party affairs in Chongqing, Chengdu, Guiyang, Kunming, and various places in the Northwest. The reporter believes that school party affairs have been inactive for a long time, and this move is of great significance. Therefore, he visited Minister Chu Chia-hua to inquire about the purpose of inspecting school party affairs. Minister Chu replied as follows: Our Party's revolution has now entered its most critical stage. Externally, we must wage a fierce and sustained war against Japanese imperialists; internally, we must engage in multifaceted construction and ideological unity. Ideological unity is the foundation for concentrating strength, and concentrated strength is the main factor for achieving victory. The education and academic circles, especially universities, have had a glorious history in the revolutionary process in the past. The decline of school party affairs in the past ten years or so is merely a respite after the revolutionary torrent of the past fifteen or sixteen years. I firmly believe that the education and academic circles are still a leading force in our Party's revolutionary strength. In the future, the enhancement of the entire national consciousness and moral cultivation will depend on the enlightenment and teachings of schools. For example, in the Franco-Prussian War, after Jena fell, Professor Fichte's ten lectures in Berlin became the driving force for the German national revival. The establishment of the University of Berlin also originated from this kind of thinking. However, although I believe that the education and academic circles of China today certainly have this kind of potential, it can only achieve its practical effect under the leadership of the Chinese Kuomintang. The purpose of our Party's leadership in the revolution is to restore the entire Chinese nation. Judging from the historical development of China, since the War of Resistance, it has entered an active and creative stage, realizing the determination of the entire Chinese nation's destiny with the blood of the entire Chinese nation, and laying the foundation for the boundless, prosperous, strong, healthy, and happy foundation of the Republic of China for all ages. Judging from the process of our Party's revolution, the National Congress will be held, and our Party's theory will enter a stage of more universal and practical application. Our Party's burden will be heavier than before, and the leaders of the education and academic circles, who carry on the past and open up the future, will also increase their responsibilities in establishing the atmosphere and enlightening future generations. This time, the Ministry has sent personnel to inspect party affairs in various schools to convey this mission, hoping that the education and academic circles will return and make greater contributions to the Chinese national revival movement.

### Chiang Meng-lin's Speech: General Situation of the Southwest Associated University; Rumors of Relocation Are Inaccurate

(Hong Kong Correspondence) Chiang Meng-lin, President of Peking University, came to Hong Kong from Chongqing last week to represent the Ministry of Education at the annual meeting of the China Education Fund Board of Directors on the 15th of last month, and to pay condolences to the family of Cai Yuanpei. On the 5th of this month, the Peking University Alumni Association in Hong Kong held a banquet for Chiang at the Windsor Restaurant. The reporter met Chiang at the banquet and inquired about the impact of the Japanese army's interception of our country's customs duties on the Gengzi indemnity used to subsidize cultural undertakings, which was guaranteed by customs duties. According to him, the government uses the guarantee of the fund to borrow from the joint office of the four banks, Bank of China, Central Bank, Communications Bank, and Agricultural Bank, according to the budget of each school and cultural institution, which can be transferred without any impact. Regarding the relocation of the United University, Chiang said that the rumors circulating outside are completely inaccurate and may be caused by misinformation. Chiang continued to give a speech to the Peking University alumni on the general situation of the Southwest Associated University, saying that since moving to Kunming from Changsha the year before last, two-thirds of the United University's school buildings have been rented from the original sites of local public schools (originally, students were scattered in various places) and temples, etc., and the remaining one-third are newly built. There are more than 3,000 students in the whole school, but it can be increased to 4,000 in the next semester. There are more than 200 teachers. In recent years, a large number of middle school graduates from all over the country have gone to apply for the entrance examination, but the school is limited by the school and instruments, maps, etc., and cannot accommodate as many as possible, which is a pity. At present, the United University's expenses are more than 1.4 million yuan per year, and 70% is actually issued, so the school's financial situation is quite difficult. Recently, prices have risen sharply. Compared with the initial move to Kunming, the average price of various daily necessities has risen from 50 to 200 times, so the lives of all faculty, staff, and students are extremely difficult. Recently, due to the soaring price of rice, each dan of rice costs 105 yuan. Poor students and small staff members who only earn dozens of yuan a month simply cannot survive. In order to remedy this situation, the central government allocated 100,000 yuan and the provincial government allocated 50,000 yuan to organize a committee to handle relief work. The committee now stipulates that the price of rice for students is 22 yuan per dan, and the price of rice for faculty and staff is 60 yuan per dan. The remaining insufficient price of rice is subsidized by the committee. The school is also quite short of books, instruments, and other supplies, but it can still barely maintain. Recently, the school bought a part of the books, and Nankai University also transported a part of them, but there is still a rush to read them in the library. In terms of school management, the Standing Committee is organized to unify management, and the presidents of Peking University, Tsinghua University, and Nankai University attend. Recently, the organization has been expanded, so the three schools can be said to be completely cooperating. Even the students graduating this summer all call themselves United University. The discipline and spirit of the students are very good.

### Finance: Speculation Is Unpredictable; The Gold Market Changes Rapidly; Initial Fall Followed by Rise, Not Yet Returned to Balance

Yesterday's spot red-hot trading conditions were volatile, rising and falling alternately, with high and low prices seen. This was because people's hearts were floating and operators' 　ambitions were not firm. At the beginning of the morning, because the exchange rate returned to long, the foreign exchange rate was reported hard, and the gold price also fell. The opening 　was 5,590 yuan. Soon, securities firms entered the market to buy, and the market seemed to be turning up. However, the foreign exchange market continued to weaken, and the securities firms frequently vomited, with increasing force, seeing 5,585 yuan, the lowest price of the day. Later, it was telegraphed that Belgium was also preparing to cope with the war, and the European war was more chaotic, all 　favored the bulls, causing securities firms to re-search, and bank and Yu firms to absorb fiercely, the momentum was not weak. At this time, foreign exchange had heard of tightening, so the high price in the morning would be 5,600 　15 yuan. The slight setback at noon was because the exchange rate tended to be stable, and there were fewer buyers. Unexpectedly, not long after the market opened in the afternoon, a high price of 5,700 　10 yuan was issued. According to the pickers, the first to push was the bank gangs, and other retail investors seeking goods were enthusiastic. By the time before the close, suddenly because of the municipal election, the victory still belonged to the British and Americans, people's hearts were stable, the exchange rate turned hard, and gold shops, money changers, and floating bulls scrambled to vomit, and the price fell again to 5,640 yuan, but the result returned to 10 yuan, to 5,650 yuan, only a slight 5 yuan compared to the previous close. The whole day's transaction was still strong, with a number of about 4,000 taels. The price of gold jewelry in silver buildings was high and low, and the result was flat. Customs gold, etc., were temporarily determined.

Red-hot Still Uncertain

Since morning, the opening exchange rate for each bar (ten taels) 　reported long, and the US exchange rate announced looseness, so people's hearts turned tired, and there were quite a few sellers. The opening 　was slammed down 65 yuan. The gold shop issued 10 taels of silver to the bank, for 5,590 yuan. Later, a certain securities gang and money changers first agreed to pick up, returning 25 yuan. The securities gang entered 30 taels of cash to the gold shop, for 5,615 yuan. However, at this time, the US exchange rate continued to report hardening, and the selling wind rose again. A certain securities gang turned from entering to exiting. At the same time, the silver building gangs also had to plug out, and it fell another 30 yuan. The bank issued 10 taels to the securities gang, down to 5,585 yuan. After this, the foreign telegram suddenly reported that the European war was intensifying, and said that Belgium was already in general mobilization, so the exchange rate urgently announced tightening, and the buying wind suddenly rose. A certain securities gang came to absorb fiercely again, and gold shops and silver building gangs also came to compete for buying, and at this time, there were very few sellers, so it flew up 110 yuan. The securities gang entered 20 taels to the gold shop, for 5,695 yuan. Then the foreign exchange turned stable, and the buyers gradually decreased, 　profit floating more, and took the opportunity to sell at a high price, returning a small 35 yuan. The gold shop did 50 taels mutually, for 5,660 yuan. Later, a certain money changer suddenly came to drag people, pulling up 8 yuan again. The money changer entered 30 taels to the silver building, for 5,660 yuan, as the closing price at noon. The opening in the afternoon was strong, 　opening and lifting 22 yuan. The gold shop entered 50 taels to the securities gang, for 5,690 yuan. Shortly after, the bank bought in, and it was 15 yuan higher. The bank absorbed 30 taels from the silver building gang, for 5,705 yuan. Later, another bank vomited out, and the gold shop also sold, once returning 10 yuan, the bank issued 20 taels to the money 　industry, for 5,695 yuan. Considering that a certain bank came to drag wildly again, at this time the foreign exchange was slightly tight, and the securities gang's appetite was also good, it猛ly raised another 35 yuan. The bank entered 20 taels to the gold shop, for 5,730 yuan. Then, because the rising wind could not avoid its sharpness, and the foreign exchange returned to balance, it caused profit-takers to exit, and quickly returned into the 5,700 yuan mark, falling back to 5,680 yuan. Later, the foreign exchange suddenly reported loosening, and there were more and more sellers. Gold shops, silver buildings, and a certain money changer sold together, and continued to fall back 40 yuan. The money changer issued 10 taels to the bank for 5,640 yuan. Near the closing time, the gold shop suddenly came to re-enter, raising it by 10 yuan. The gold shop did 20 taels mutually, for 5,650 yuan, as the evening closing price. As a result, it was 5 yuan lower than the previous day's squeeze. The full day was 145 yuan up and down. The selling price of the cash shop's own brand gold was a few yuan higher than the red-hot, and the purchase was reduced by 20 yuan. The current standard gold was more than 50 yuan lower than the hanging gold, and there were few openings.

Jewelry Also Abnormally Tortuous

### Foreign Currency Weakness

The foreign currency market yesterday was still in a state of agitation and uncertainty, and in the end, they all tended to fall. The British and American orders for pounds were still in great need, and the market price was very easy. In the afternoon, because the gold price fell sharply, it also followed the decline. British gold notes and other history, US dollar notes initially fell to 16 yuan, 6 jiao and 4 fen due to the rise in the price of pounds, and then rose to 16 yuan, 7 jiao and 4 fen, and then fell back to 16 yuan, 6 jiao and a half in the afternoon. After 1 o'clock, news about the British and Americans being favorable in the current election of the Public Concession Board of Directors was frequently reported, and it was also reported that the Chinese army was advancing rapidly towards northern Jiangxi, and was not far from Nanchang, so the selling atmosphere suddenly became strong, and the evening market fell to 16 yuan, 5 jiao and 5 fen. Hong Kong notes fell and then recovered slightly, French franc notes and Annam notes showed a very soft trend, Singapore notes and Dutch Luo, Fei, and Annam notes all tended to fall, Japanese gold notes were initially stable, and then tended to fall, and the evening market was 　yuan, 3 jiao and 3 fen, Korean notes were suddenly in heavy supply, and the market price suddenly tended to fall, and the evening market was yuan, zero jiao, 6 fen and 5 li, and the rest did not move.

### Securities: Foreign Stocks Rebound Actively, Domestic Bonds Fluctuate Irregularly

Yesterday, the securities grey market continued to be weak due to the depressed mood and many incidents, but the 　trend was still easing. As soon as there was a slight decline, someone would buy. It is heard that the Nanchang war is quite favorable, and the market price can be slightly recovered, but there will be no major changes. Many longs in the 20th are gradually coming out, which is a phenomenon that should occur after encountering a lottery. The 30th, etc. 　are still constantly absorbing. Yesterday, the type C once reached a high of 　50 yuan in the morning, but it immediately went down 　. People's hearts can be seen here. The selling atmosphere in the afternoon was even worse than in the morning, and each 　went slightly smaller again, but the longs and shorts were still quite equal, so the trend was stable. As a result, except for type D, which was slightly better by 5 fen, the rest continued to be smaller by about 1 or 2 jiao. The total number of transactions was estimated at about 1 million yuan. A brief table is listed below:

Stock transactions: 40 shares of Ning Shao Company shares were traded, and the price was 10 　yuan and 6 jiao.

Due to good news from the Norwegian and Swedish front lines, the stock 　of the public industry stock market should be excellent, and the 　of industrial stocks has made progress, and the trend is extremely active. The evening closing price 　is the best of the day. The soaring new peak of China Ken Zhi shares and Shanghai Silver Company shares is the second characteristic of yesterday. The former had a very large number of transactions, once seeing 22 yuan, and then fell back to 21 yuan due to profit-taking. At the close, the buyers regained the upper hand, and the price was 21 yuan, 25 bought in, and 75 sold out. Shanghai Silver Company was also very active, and at the close, 28 yuan and a half had buyers. International Yangzi and British United 　shares were actively traded, each buying in at 25 yuan, 75, 17 yuan and a half, and 42 yuan, 2 　at the close.

### Grains Rice Market Settled, Foreign Rice Arrives in a Constant Stream

Yesterday morning, the rice market continued the weakness of the previous afternoon. The market was still bearish. Although wholesale merchants had no intention to sell, speculators were watching. Many retail investors recovered their funds, with prices dropping nearly one yuan. The low-grade foreign rice opened at 37.5 yuan. However, as the sales in the inland villages and towns picked up, the market turned tight again, and the prices rebounded by one yuan. No. 1 Saigon rice was priced at 43 yuan, fire-milled rice at 41.5 yuan to 41 yuan, and low-grade rice at 38.5 yuan. The market fluctuated for a long time until the close, with no significant changes. As a result, the closing prices were only two or three jiao higher than the previous session, which could only be described as a settlement. Glutinous rice remained flat from morning to noon. As for thick japonica rice and early rice, over 2,000 packages were transferred from Hongkou yesterday, and there were no significant fluctuations in the market. Old japonica rice remained at 40 yuan per dan. The asking price for early rice was as high as 40 yuan, medium grade at 39.5 yuan, and low grade at 39 yuan. The off-exchange transactions were said to be mediocre, similar to the previous day.

Foreign rice continued to arrive. Yesterday, the Taikoo Dockyard Company's Shandong vessel arrived in Shanghai, carrying 8,596 packages from Hong Kong. In addition, the Jardine Matheson & Co.'s Yong Sheng vessel arrived at the port the day before yesterday (the 10th), also loaded with 1,384 packages of foreign rice from Hong Kong, with 454 packages to be transferred to Yantai and 7,625 packages to Tianjin. (Ancestor)

After the foreign rice market opened yesterday morning, due to the continuous price increases in recent days, there was a real lack of demand. The recent enthusiastic and active participants were mostly speculators and scalpers. Once prices rose and profits were made, they immediately took the opportunity to sell. Therefore, the selling pressure was extremely strong after the market opened, especially the April-May futures of No. 2 Saigon rice, which were sold the most, opening at 49.56 yuan. The market appeared fairly stable, and the large investors did not engage in hoarding due to the expansion of the European war and high gold prices. However, when prices were stable, it suddenly attracted inquiries from merchants and speculators. Moreover, as the overseas prices were not reduced, merchants refused to release their goods, and the market gradually rose, with strong buying interest. The April-May No. 2 Saigon rice rose to 50.02 yuan, and the transaction volume increased to 400. Currently, foreign rice is initially stable and then becomes popular, rising by about five or six jiao. No. 1 Saigon rice also rose to 42.8 yuan, and No. 2 rice to 40.03 yuan. Other types of rice also rose in unison. The total transaction volume of spot rice for the whole day was more than 70 packages.

### Flour Continues to be Firm, Wheat Market Stagnates

Flour prices remain firm. The price of No. 1 flour mill settled at 13.8 yuan, and there were no official offers from buyers. As for the recovered goods, the sentiment was quite firm amidst the serious European situation and high gold prices. However, the sales of inland flour coming to Shanghai were inevitably slightly affected. It was reported that the old car brand initially opened at 13.41 yuan, and the afternoon opening price was 13.45 yuan. The Double Lion brand has also risen to 13 yuan. Foreign flour merchants slightly inquired, with prices at 13.78 yuan. The total transaction volume of various flours in the market continued to be over 10,000 packages.

Due to the thin inventory of wheat, there was some news of price increases. However, Chinese factories still had a demand, but they were unwilling to raise prices to buy, so the prices fell and could not rise, leading to both sides taking different paths and a de facto stagnation.

### Yarn and Cotton Spring Sales Period Shortened, Yarn Market Price Increases Moderate, Double Horse Brand More Than 500 Yuan Higher Than Last Year

The yarn market, which had been soaring in recent days, showed a slightly moderating trend yesterday. However, the general sentiment was still mostly bullish, so when the market dipped, many people eagerly bought in, thus supporting the current market price. However, it was found that at the end of last year, the futures price of 20-count Double Horse yarn was 763 yuan, and it has now risen to 1,774 yuan. This kind of increase cannot be said to be not frightening. Moreover, the spring sales period is gradually diminishing, and the future changes are difficult to predict. The morning opening of yarn was slightly flat due to the lengthening of British and American exchange rates and the easing of the US exchange rate. The factory price of 20-count Double Horse yarn was 1,245 yuan, and the spot price was 1,250 yuan. Later, the sentiment tightened slightly. It was heard that a certain yarn rose, and it was also affected, with the factory price rising to 1,258 yuan and the spot price to 1,263 yuan. According to the half-day transaction statistics, 2,040 packages were traded. The spot price of 20-count Double Horse yarn increased by 3 yuan, and 10-count coarse yarn fell by 10 yuan. In addition, 285 pieces of spot yarn were shipped to Hong Kong today (the 12th), 165 pieces to Guangzhou Bay, and 10 pieces to Haikou. The quantities purchased by various merchants are listed as follows:

Fellow merchants 1,400 Hong Kong 630

Ningbo 10 Total 2,040

### American and Indian Cotton Transactions Show Some Improvement

Cotton transactions remain sluggish, but American and Indian cotton transactions show some improvement due to their cheap prices. The factories, except for Unified and Rongfeng factories, have a slight demand, while others are mediocre. The spot cotton transaction situation is listed below:

Three remaining bales 37.00 Unified purchased 24 pieces

White Luo Qu 225.00 Rongfeng purchased 500 pieces

Mittling 282.50 Fellow merchants purchased 100 pieces

Da Zhong Ji 240.00 Also purchased 100 pieces

Ping Guo 185.00 Also purchased 400 pieces

Ping Guo 18.00 Also purchased 400 pieces

Olmula 24.50 Also purchased 200 pieces

Grass bags 197.00 Also purchased 100 bags

Separately, regarding cotton market prices, the New York cotton market was quiet on the day, with a slight increase in the early morning due to purchases by some fellow traders, but it strengthened later due to short covering. As a result, the cotton price failed to rise due to the decline in Wall Street stock prices, so the closing price showed mixed ups and downs compared to the previous day. The Indian cotton market yesterday fell due to sales by some European merchants and profit-taking by bulls. The Egyptian cotton market rose by fourteen or five pounds.

The spot trade of foreign cotton in Shanghai was always exceptionally brisk, all being transactions among fellow traders, while the factories were very quiet. Although there were many arrivals of American and Indian cotton, they were all for the factories. The Japanese were quite active in purchasing, mostly Brazilian cotton, as they were deeply concerned about the difficulties in Indian cotton arriving in Shanghai. The spot price of the cotton market yesterday, converted at an exchange rate of 6 yuan for US dollars, is as follows:

20-count American Mittling 23.25

20-count Another inferior grade 282.0

12-count Another 30.45

32-count Another inferior grade 310.00

42-count Another 314.90

42-count Another inferior grade 205.00

### Piece Goods Cotton Cloth Sales Thrive, Selling Prices Reach New Highs

Domestic cloth The market opened steadily yesterday morning, but turned tight again at noon, with prices rising with each sale. As a result, 11, 14, and 16-pound coarse cloth rose by 5 jiao to 1 yuan per bolt, 9 and 13-pound cloth rose by 2 jiao to 5 jiao, and fine cloth and fine twill rose by 5 jiao to 1 yuan. Bleached and dyed cloth also rose by about 1 yuan. Actual sales in Zhejiang Province were strong, with over 400 pieces of Chengdu Dapeng Fugui fine cloth, Jardine Matheson coarse cloth, twill, and bleached cloth being traded. Merchants from Fujian, Guangdong, Anhui, and northern Jiangsu still had strong purchasing intentions, with 300 pieces of printed cloth, bleached cloth, pongee, and colored cloth being traded. Over 100,000 bolts of bleached and dyed grey cloth were handled on this street.

Eastern cloth In the morning market, the white goods market was flat and weak due to the decline in yarn prices. However, with fellow traders tightening the market and external transactions still strong, the rising trend continued and reached new highs. The closing price of 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth was 38.25 yuan, and Four Gentlemen's serge spot price rose to 1.155 yuan per yard.

Exports 50 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Hong Kong today (the 12th), 70 pieces to Guangzhou Bay, 25 pieces to Haikou, and 250 pieces to Haiphong.

### Miscellaneous Grains Yellow Beans Fail to Rally

The yellow bean market conditions yesterday showed a slightly tight trend, and transactions were slightly more active, so the sentiment was slightly optimistic and wanted to rally. However, as the outlets could not be concentrated, the market price was also difficult to push up. However, the situation of wanting to buy and wanting to sell fluctuated up and down. Yesterday, oil extraction factories, merchants, and hoarders in this street accounted for one-third of the sales, totaling the transaction of Bengbu beans, priced at 12.5 yuan. Chuzhou beans were priced at 20 yuan per dong, over 200 packages of Dingjia Prefecture beans were priced at 21.4 yuan, 300 packages of Qingdao beans were priced at 26.6 yuan, one cart of Nanjing beans was priced at 18.4 yuan, over 200 packages of Taihu beans were priced at 21.2 yuan, 100 packages of Yangzhou mountain yellow beans were priced at 17.7 yuan, and 200 packages of Chongming sand yellow beans were priced at 20.03 yuan. Fifty packages of Pinghu Du beans were priced at 21.8 yuan. Today, 2,000 packages of yellow beans will be shipped to Hong Kong.

### North and South Goods Tunxi Mushrooms Offer New Crop, Sichuan Preserved Vegetables See New High Prices

Tunxi mushrooms, the highest grade among domestic products, have recently arrived one after another. The first batch of goods opened well yesterday, with the prices of flower mushrooms ranging from 918.9 yuan to 878.1 yuan, 628 yuan for medium grade, 615.8 yuan for large slices, and 464 yuan to 468.6 yuan and 489 yuan for plain grade.

Sichuan preserved vegetables have been lacking recent arrivals, and the market inventory is extremely tight, so the selling price has gradually increased. The market price yesterday reached 150 yuan, also a new high price.

### Metals Tinplate Calls for 200 Yuan

Recently, the war in Northern Europe has been serious, and foreign exchange has fallen sharply. The asking prices for metal products have risen again. However, the sales of various outlets have been quiet. Merchants dare not purchase, so the market situation is extremely sluggish. Tinplate has a long history in Shanghai, and most of its sources are from the United States. Although British and Italian goods are also frequently seen in the market, the arrival of goods has suddenly felt tight since the outbreak of the European war. Currently, most of the circulating goods in the market are American goods. It has been found that not many have been sold off in recent days, so the asking prices have increased. Currently, Italian goods weighing 180 pounds are priced at 195 yuan per box, American goods weighing 180 pounds are sold at 200 yuan, Italian goods weighing 200 pounds are priced at 210 yuan, and American Zheng Hao goods weighing 200 pounds require 220 yuan.

### Coal Indian Coal Remains Scarce

Although the sales of Indian coal have been sluggish on this street recently, the European war has expanded, and there are concerns that the source will be cut off. Generally, fellow traders and speculative investors, seeing the changing environment, have spontaneously generated a hoarding mentality, buying and vying to purchase, and the market situation is gradually improving. The asking price for Kirk Grade coal by fellow traders has been 225 yuan, and the owners are still tightening the market and unwilling to easily sell. The shops on this street have not yet moved, and the price delivered to customers is 240 yuan per ton for coal and 230 yuan for coal dust.

### Old Newspaper Excerpts Sixty-Seven Years Ago (352)

(From the Shun Pao, Twelfth Year of the Tongzhi Reign of the Deposed Qing Dynasty)

The Situation in Burma (2)

The Burmese King's use of a spear to kill ministers is akin to the emperor of India personally taking action. His disregard for national affairs resembles a ruler who indulges in lacquerware enjoyment. His fondness for licentious pleasures is like the last ruler of the Later Shu dynasty, taking his concubines into the Jingyang Palace well. Any one of these flaws is enough to lead to the downfall of a nation, let alone the Burmese King possessing all of them in one person, leaving opportunities for others to covet the throne. Burma has no strategic defenses, no reliable troops; what does he rely on that he does not fear, and thus indulges in such tyrannical actions? Ministers and close advisors are the foundation of a nation, those upon whom it relies. Respecting and cherishing them is what is meant by "Able men are bulwarks, princes are city walls; do not let the city crumble, nor be afraid of being alone." This is a universal truth throughout history. Even if ministers and close advisors are truly guilty of crimes worthy of punishment, their penalties should be discussed with all ministers. There should never be a case where the ruler of a country takes it upon himself to kill people as a display of power. Furthermore, the Burmese King does not kill to establish power, but kills for pleasure. This is even more cruel than Zhou's abandonment of the elderly and common people! The Western Jin dynasty, with its fratricidal strife, triggered the chaos of the Five Barbarian Tribes. The Northern Qi dynasty, with its widespread slaughter of the imperial clan, led to the humiliation of captivity. Throughout history, any dynasty that cuts off its branches and leaves will inevitably weaken its roots. The proverb says, "When the root is large and the branches small, it is secure." Does the Burmese King not consider this at all? Moreover, the British envoy stationed in Burma has repeatedly remonstrated, but the King refuses to listen. How blind and ignorant can he be? In recent times, countries that have treaties with other nations all have envoys stationed there to strengthen alliances, communicate intentions, learn about customs, and handle diplomatic affairs for their home countries. Remonstrating is not part of their duties. Yet the British envoy has remonstrated repeatedly, but the Burmese King still ignores him. The ministers of the Burmese court are cautiously protecting themselves, fearing they will not have enough time. There is definitely no one who will strongly remonstrate or argue with force. The Burmese King's cruelty will undoubtedly have no end. Alas! If he only becomes alarmed after encountering enemies and external threats, can Burma still be saved?

Spring and Autumn

### Jesus and the Unemployed (2)

In the parable cited today, although Jesus did not explicitly say so, it contains this principle. The vineyard owner said to the people standing on the street, "Why are you standing here idle all day?" They replied, "Because no one has hired us." If someone were to hire them, they would be willing to work all day. Jesus here is interpreting God's justice. People should also do this, but it is not seen in practice. What people do is the principle of equal value, that is, pay a small price and get a small amount of things. Our work is calculated in hours, days, or years, and our rewards are also calculated in the same way. But in God's justice, there is a more meaningful principle, which is to look at people first, not work. Those who are willing to work should not lack daily food. It is a person's duty to work, and we despise those who are idle and lazy. I agree with the principle of the Apostle Paul: those who do not work should not eat. In all levels of society, there are many people who should be sent to special institutions to receive training and develop their work habits. Society cannot support those who are strong and healthy but unwilling to work. But what about those who are willing to work but cannot find work? As mentioned earlier, it is a person's duty to work, then, we can further say that people should have the right to work. I wonder if society can be organized in such a way that everyone can get full-time work. I think even the most sophisticated social plan cannot fully achieve this, so it is best to let people take turns to rest, but first, we must find a way to enable them to get through this idle period. This is a reasonable conclusion, and the vineyard owner in this parable did just that. Society should also have this justice, so that honest workers, in times of idleness, will not be humiliated to seek and accept charitable alms, or become disabled due to prolonged idleness. I think all three parties should do their best to prepare in advance. First, the workers themselves must have self-esteem and prepare for a rainy day; second, the industrialists must have foresight and enable the workers to join in the preparation, and then happily return to work after the economic downturn has passed; third, is the rest of us. We, as consumers, should pay attention to justice, take care of unemployed workers, and have foresight to seek the health of the entire social structure and prevent the waste of national talent. Workers, the industrial system, and the country, working together as the basis for an unemployment insurance plan, can save us from the shame and sadness of future unemployment. By doing this, we are applying God's justice to our society. Therefore, for the sake of Christ's original intention, I ask you to support this unemployment insurance plan. (The End)

### Lessons of Speculation

— Dao Ke

Learn from the previous mistake, and become wiser from one setback, gaining one experience and lesson. This time, the writer was influenced by colleagues engaged in speculative transactions, and without knowing my own limitations, I imitated my peers and boldly ventured into the black market to gamble by buying and selling US dollar bills. I knew beforehand that speculative transactions were improper and dangerous, but with a fluke mentality, I finally tried it.

The fact is this: many friends in the financial industry said to me, "The US exchange rate is only shrinking day by day, and it will never loosen. Maybe it will shrink from six yuan to five yuan and seven and a half cents, or five yuan and a half. Brother, don't miss it, it's time to go long!…" So, I racked my brains and tried every means to raise 200 yuan in legal currency as margin for trading 100 US dollar bills, and respectfully sent it to the securities firm in the black market. They immediately set up a trade for me, buying 100 US dollars at an exchange rate of 16 yuan and 25 cents. As usual, I had to pay 1625 yuan in legal currency. Because they collected the client's margin, the remaining amount was a loan, with a monthly interest rate of 1.5%, calculated daily. As for the commission for buying and selling, I gladly accepted it according to their business rules. That was near the end of March. In the blink of an eye, it was April 1st, and the US exchange rate did indeed shrink greatly, from 6 yuan and 125 cents to 6 yuan and 9375 cents, 6 yuan… until the middle, it even broke through the 6 yuan barrier, and changed to 5 yuan and 96875 cents… The US dollar bill price rose from 16 yuan and 30 cents to 35 cents… directly to a peak of 57 cents, 62 cents… At this time, I was secretly happy, thinking that I had already made a good profit of 37 cents very quickly, and I was still fantasizing that I could rise directly from 66 cents to 17 yuan, and then prepare to sell. Who knew that after the initial peak of 62 cents, it gradually fell suddenly! From 45 cents… all the way down to 25 cents, I still mistakenly believed in the subjective view that the US exchange rate would shrink greatly again, and waited foolishly for one day, two days, three days, four days… But the more I waited, the more rigid it became, and the US dollar bill market became smaller and smaller.

On the 8th, the opening morning was only at 10 cents, 15 cents, and then gradually retreated to 07 cents. I calculated the cost myself, (plus more than ten days of interest and commission) ah, oh no! One US dollar, oh no! One US dollar, is losing 30 cents. Wouldn't 100 US dollars have to touch more than 30 yuan? If I wait any longer, wouldn't half of the margin be sacrificed soon? So, I reluctantly cut my losses and sold, with the price being only 16 yuan and 08 cents. On the US dollar bill itself, I had to lose 17 yuan, plus a commission of 5 yuan, and interest of 8 or 9 yuan at 1.5%. In total, more than 20 yuan was deducted from the margin, which really left me speechless and eating bitter melon, with no place to complain. Spending more than 30 yuan to buy experience and lessons, this is the writer's motivation for writing this article, and my own regret. As the saying goes, "Worms in the pickle jar die in the pickle jar!" I sincerely advise friends who are addicted to speculation in the black market! Wake up quickly!

### Public Buses to Raise Fares Again

— Zhi Zhi

British-owned public buses will increase fares again starting from the 15th. The reason announced by the company authority is: First, the increased import value of rubber tires and other parts. Second, the increased salaries of employees, which directly increases the company's expenses.

Regarding the first point, it is indeed a current factual matter, but we should understand that the soaring prices of various parts and tires for public buses are mainly due to the drastic shrinkage of foreign exchange. However, the current foreign exchange value is not as low as the worst period, and the foreign exchange value fluctuated most drastically after last year's summer vacation. Now, it has stabilized at a considerable level, maintaining between four shillings for the British pound and five or six yuan for the US dollar. Then, according to this situation, perhaps after waiting for a very short period of time, the value of imported goods from various countries will naturally and gradually decrease, so the only reason that the company authorities hold for increasing fares today will no longer exist.

Second, we think we have not yet forgotten that not long ago, the steelworkers, drivers, and ticket sellers of the public bus company once declared a strike because they felt that their usual treatment was not enough to maintain their lives and demanded an increase in subsidies. From this, it can be seen that the increase in employee salaries is still a recent event.

Moreover, we should observe the nature of the public bus business itself. Its original nature cannot be compared with those whose sole purpose is to make profits. I think the enlightened British public bus company authorities must be deeply aware of this. At a time when the livelihood of the citizens is worrying and it is not easy to live in Shanghai, it seems that the public bus company authorities' proposal to increase fares and burden the people is also an undesirable phenomenon.

Furthermore, let the writer add one more word: the heyday of the public bus business was actually after the "August 13th" Shanghai battle. Just look at how in the past year or two, due to the needs of the abnormal prosperity of Shanghai, the company has opened many new routes and added many new vehicles. This is a fact that everyone has witnessed.

In short, the public bus company's fare increase, after studying it from all aspects, is ultimately an inappropriate and unreasonable move. Therefore, I advise the company authorities not to only seek temporary profit, but to take into account the burden of the entire society, and after today's severe situation passes, to also follow others in immediately reducing and lowering fares to ensure the company's future business.

### After the Rain, a Clear Sky

— Bao Tianxiao

Chapter 22 News Spreads from Beyond the Horizon Sound Opinions, Universal Beliefs

He Liyu said, "Lover sister! You are always telling jokes. Even for an opera, two or three people cannot make up a company, let alone a newspaper office!" Zhu Airen said, "You don't know! That was during the war. You were in America, so you don't know about these things. The entire assets of the newspaper I'm talking about are only one load, not at all wrong. This load, and it's not a heavy load, just a light one. At either end of that load, one is a radio receiver, and the other is a box of ink printing machines, plus some newsprint and wax paper. Aren't they just two things, and neither is heavy? The so-called three-person cooperation means that one person is in charge of editing, which is to write down the important news received by the radio receiver. If you want to express an opinion, you can also make a short comment. One person is in charge of printing. He has to lay wax paper, write with a stylus, and then print it out sheet by sheet on the ink printing machine. One person is in charge of distribution. Some are distributed to various subscription locations, and some are posted on the wall to become a wall newspaper. The important parts of a newspaper office are these three items. Aren't three people taking responsibility? Moreover, the three people can also work together. When listening to the radio, the printing and distribution departments may be empty and can help him. When printing with the ink printing machine and writing on wax paper, the editing and distribution departments may be empty. When posting on the wall and distributing to subscription locations, the editing and printing departments are empty again. Can't the three people help each other? Moreover, there is one convenient point, this newspaper office is mobile. Unlike their magnificent buildings, seven or eight stories high, built in Shanghai, but confined to Shanghai. The newspaper can be transported elsewhere, but the newspaper office cannot be moved elsewhere. But they are different. If they are happy here today, and unhappy tomorrow, they can move elsewhere. A small sailing boat, or the entire property of the newspaper office, can be towed away. There is nothing more comfortable. So, today, after seeing this large-scale newspaper office, I thought of the difficulties and hardships of running a newspaper in China in the beginning." Wu Qunsu said, "The ancient Chinese book says: 'When released, it fills the universe; when rolled up, it retreats into secrecy.' I didn't expect that the newspaper business would be like this." Shao Huihua said, "Sister Qunsu is showing off her knowledge again. You said retreating into secrecy, but we have someone here who refuses to retreat into secrecy." Everyone was stunned and said, "Who are you talking about?" Shao Huihua said, "I'm talking about one of the brides sitting here today. When people are newly married, it's called a honeymoon, and they don't come out much, which is really called retreating into secrecy. But our Danyu sister is willing to join us as six people, which is really releasing it to the universe, refusing to retreat into secrecy." Qunsu said, "It's a pity that the honey is the honey of sweetness, not the secret of secrecy." Huihua said, "Oh! I read the wrong word! Punish me with a drink!" (262)

### Fair Price and Price Increase

— Yi Peng

In front of the news that an eight-cent bowl of white rice has been improved to seven cents, and a fifty-cent plate of rice has been reduced to forty cents, I also saw a large headline of "Coal Briquettes Rise Again." I think the editor, when issuing these two news items, must have had some doubts about this contradictory phenomenon, right? And for us common people, this sudden feeling is really worth the four words "between laughter and tears."

It is worth our gratitude that the rice and restaurant industries have lowered prices due to the recent fall in rice prices. Since the prices that have jumped up with all sorts of excuses, we have never heard of them being reduced. Because of the heavy pursuit of profit, they have even raised prices again and again without even an "excuse," which has made people reach the point of "headache": The repeated rise in coal briquettes is one of them.

Forgive us for not understanding the inside story of "arrivals" and "water freight," etc., beyond what we read in the newspaper. However, after the price of coal briquettes rose after the Spring Festival, summarizing the news we read: there were appeals from the hot water industry; advertisements from the Coal Briquette Industry Association and holders of coal briquette warehouse receipts, mutually shirking responsibility; an open letter from small coal briquette merchants to Yu Qiaqing;… etc. From these news and advertisements, at least half of the inside story can be seen. Fortunately, what is gratifying is that a "fair sale" message followed. However, following this "fair sale" message, we cannot forget the petition to "request a reduction in water freight." Then, please connect it with yesterday's report of "another price increase," then we don't need to understand the "inside story" to be able to understand it like the back of our hand.

The current conclusion is: Fair price is a prelude to price increase; price increase uses fair price as a charge.

### Michelangelo Antonioni said: If There Were No Edison

— Jing Yuan

——There Would Be No Movies in the World

The life of the world-famous American inventor Thomas Edison has now been filmed and put on the screen. In today's Hollywood, which is vying to shoot biographical films, the production of this film is undeniably welcome news. This famous biographical film by MGM is divided into two parts. The first half is "Young Edison," which chronicles Edison's childhood, with this year's film emperor Michelangelo Antonioni in the lead role. The second half is "Mature Edison," starring Spencer Tracy. Now the first half, "Young Edison," has been completed.

Michelangelo Antonioni most admires Edison and Henry Ford, and Edison's childhood mischief and activity are very suitable for his personality. Therefore, in this film, he not only gives full play to his best acting skills, but also vividly and perfectly portrays the various activities of Edison's childhood. In addition, with the supporting roles of George Bancroft, and Virginia Weidler, and Norman Taurog directing, success is naturally expected. In order to shoot this film, Michelangelo Antonioni no longer writes musical scores in his spare time. Every day, he tirelessly reads biographies about this great scientist, or practices Morse code or studies batteries. Therefore, when the film is completed, his knowledge of telegraphs, generators, electric lights, cement, storage batteries, streetcars, phonographs, telephones, etc., is much richer than before.

Many of the props in the film are relics from the life of the great scientist. The small red-tiled school where Edison studied as a child and the two-story house where Edison and his mother lived in the small town of Huron in 1860 were also copied after on-site investigations. A month before the start of filming, Michelangelo Antonioni traveled to the Edison's former residence in Greenfield Village, where many of the great scientist's relics from his life are preserved. At that time, Michelangelo Antonioni also visited Frances Zoll, the librarian of Greenfield Village Library. This old man was a good friend of Edison during his lifetime, and also the only person who personally witnessed Edison's first experiment with electric lighting. Michelangelo Antonioni heard many anecdotes about the great scientist's childhood from him, which further increased his interest and determination to shoot this film.

"If there were no Edison, there would be no movies in the world." Michelangelo Antonioni said, "So I must work hard to shoot this film, so that I can be worthy of the inventor of the film."

### A Talk About Li Lihua's Family Background

— Shui Cao

In recent years, under the continuous excavation of newcomers by Yihua Company, they have finally encountered a very promising talent, her name is Li Lihua, a lotus flower just emerging from the water, who has been trained in opera troupes since childhood, and has very rich artistic talent and knowledge. Her past life is very similar to Yuan Meiyun, but her environment is better than Yuan Meiyun, so her future is even broader.

Do readers want to know Li Lihua's family background? It's very simple, her father is Li Guifang, a leading man who occupies a very important position in the old opera circle. Li Guifang's beautiful appearance has fascinated many Zhou Lang enthusiasts in the past. Li Lihua inherited her father's legacy and is even more beautiful and intelligent. Although she has not been with Yihua for a long time, she has already become like a crystal-clear treasure and is cherished by many people in Yihua Company. Li Pingqian quickly invited her to star in "Biography of Heroes," and the company executives are even more unwilling to be careless, and invited the only leading man of today, Mei Xi, to co-star with her. With her talent and experience, it should not be difficult for Li Lihua to achieve fame in one fell swoop.

### After Watching "Working Women"

— Hua

In today's society, where the feudal male-centered system still remains, the general female profession is not a "beautiful decoration" or "vase." This playful and insulting name is the best proof. Moreover, some institutions even grandly regard "married women" as an exception.

Shi Huafu's "Working Women" is to point out this unreasonable phenomenon. He adopts a comedic form to satirize those "selfish people" wearing masks, and even strengthens their sins from the side, such as relying on "status" to "pursue" female employees, and even engaging in corruption and private gain. However, in the end, "Ladies and gentlemen, you have awakened me today." After the masks are torn off, the "director," who still expresses his dignity with a trumped-up charge of "conspiracy," will not wake up in this "sneeze." This is the author's magnanimity.

The whole play is divided into four acts. The humor of the dialogue and the beauty of the structure make the whole play flow smoothly in a humorous atmosphere.

The directing technique is quite close to the style of American movies, such as throwing flower vases, female preparation's sending tea, and the director's "bragging" in front of the curtain, all of which strengthen the success of this comedy.

In terms of actors, there is a lack of group support. For example, the nephew in the third act seems to be a prominent one in the whole. Therefore, his exaggerated movements that should be in the comedy are too much.

At a time when costume dramas have entered a fixed period, the emergence of this comedy has opened up a new path for our playwrights to some extent.

### Theatrical News

— Shanghai

Zhou Yihua, the former stage manager of the Carlton Theatre, initiated a large-scale charity performance at the end of the month to aid the war-stricken refugees of his hometown Shaoxing. This initiative involves cooperation between amateur and professional performers. He has already obtained the agreement of backstage manager Zhou Xinfang, and it has been decided to hold two evening performances. Ticket prices will be sold for a maximum of three yuan, and the repertoire is under discussion.

Female impersonator Wang Huichan performed at the Carlton Theatre the night before last, co-starring in "Yu Tang Chun" with Gao Baisui, Wang Zhongping, and Ge Cijiang. She went backstage at seven o'clock and proceeded directly to the dressing room shared by Jin Suwen, Zhang Huicong, and Yang Bijun to prepare for the performance, without performing the ritual of burning incense and paying respects to the patron deity. Yuan Meiyun and Huichan are relatives, so she also went to the dressing room to take care of everything.

The Shanghai Star Peking Opera Troupe invited the newly engaged actors Wang Junchen, Qian Fulu, Zhang Yanxia, Yan Chunlou, and Li Youfen, a group of five, to travel to the Philippines. They departed yesterday aboard the Java liner "Tjisaakana". Performers and movie stars alike came to the dock to see them off, attracting considerable public attention.

The Chunming Opera Troupe, co-founded by Wang Xichun and An Shuyuan, except for Xichun and her daughter, the entire company returned to Shanghai on the Shandong steamer the day before yesterday. Xichun and her daughter are scheduled to return by ship on the ninth, and it is said that they may arrive today.
