### Explanation

Everyone hopes to have a set of crystal-clear, healthy, and white teeth. Unfortunately, once attacked by cavity-causing bacteria, the suffering that follows is as deep as the sea. This is because these bacteria are exceptionally aggressive. They destroy a strong tooth as if a group of barbarians were invading a city with swords and spears!

### Explanation

When we feel tooth pain or inflammation inside the tooth, it means these dreadful bacteria are already at work. At this point, even if you try to use other medications, it is to no avail. The bacteria have already penetrated deep into the tooth, and the enamel is severely damaged. From then on, you will be constantly worried, not only suffering mentally but also severely impacting your physical health!

### Explanation

Since teeth are so crucial to our health, we should always take good care of them. However, ordinary toothpaste can only whiten teeth and may lack antibacterial power or damage the enamel. It cannot fully shoulder the responsibility of protecting teeth, leading to rampant cavities and patients suffering in agony. Therefore, we must use toothpaste with fine quality and strong antibacterial power to prevent corrosion and maintain healthy teeth.

### Explanation

Meeshulin Toothpaste is a remarkable product of Baitan Incense Soap Factory in 1940. It is made with precious and novel ingredients using scientific methods. It not only cleans teeth with a pleasant fragrance but also has an exceptionally strong antibacterial power. Its effectiveness is comparable to a modern iron army equipped with supreme weapons.

### Allied Rearguard Fights Bravely; Evacuation Largely Completed; After Two Days of Fierce Fighting, the French Recapture Abbeville; German Counterattack on the Lower Somme Fails

London: According to reliable non-official sources, the Allied evacuation from the front can now be considered largely completed. Only one division remains on the front lines. Prior to this information, well-informed sources had already reported that 75% of the British Expeditionary Force and the French and Belgian armies had escaped danger. (1st, Combined Industry Telegraph)

Paris: The General Headquarters announced in its war bulletin this morning, "The British and French armies, navies, and air forces continue to fight to the death in the Dunkirk area, resisting enemy attacks and covering the evacuation of Allied troops through the port. Furthermore, the enemy's large-scale counterattacks in the Somme River area have been repelled." (1st, Havas Telegraph)

Paris: The French Public Gazette reported that the British and French forces in Dunkirk are still fully united, fighting fiercely to resist the German advance and ensure the safe evacuation of the remaining troops. The enemy's counterattack in the Somme region was repelled, demonstrating their particular concern about the French crossing the Somme River. (1st, Reuters Telegraph)

Paris: Military figures here recently stated that the Allied forces in the front area are continuing to retreat towards the port of Dunkirk, with the situation proceeding very smoothly. Part of General Prioux's troops have already withdrawn to Dunkirk to participate in the defense, while another part is still fighting the Germans en route, but their position is becoming increasingly difficult. As the Germans are unable to attack Dunkirk from the sea, they can only bomb with planes, lay mines on the sea surface, and launch torpedoes with torpedo boats. However, the supply of Allied ammunition and food has not been blocked, and unnecessary troops can still evacuate by ship as usual without being hindered, with minimal losses. As for the fighting on the lower Somme River, our forces have recaptured a bridgehead on the north bank. The enemy launched two counterattacks yesterday, one with infantry only and the other with aircraft and tanks, but both were repelled by our forces. Apart from reconnaissance activities and intermittent artillery fire, there has been no major development in other areas of the front. (1st, Havas Telegraph)

Paris: According to an official announcement last night, the French Somme River troops, after 48 hours of intense fighting, recaptured Abbeville on the coast yesterday, opening a bloody path for the Allied counterattack. A certain war analyst stated that General Weygand's troops have completely cleared the enemy from the Somme River estuary, capturing two hundred prisoners, and annihilating several enemy motorized units. It is estimated that 200,000 Allied troops are still trapped in the front. The Allied troops are continuously evacuating from Dunkirk, but they are fighting one against three in a desperate struggle. (1st, Associated Press Telegraph)

Paris: The German army doubled its efforts yesterday to cut off the French rearguard troops who were fighting their way to the coast. However, the British and French forces are still holding the front highlands. According to a French military spokesman, the large bodies of water, up to two feet deep, to the north and south of Dunkirk have halted the movement of infantry and motorized units. Therefore, the British and French forces are able to continue boarding ships rapidly at the port. Some Belgian units did not comply with the surrender order and arrived in Dunkirk with their officers and the corps commander. At the same time, there were reports of intense fighting on the Somme front. French forces have recaptured western Abbeville. At another location near the mouth of the Somme River, French forces have crossed the river and secured a stronghold on the north bank. It is reported that French tanks played an important role in these battles. The Germans suffered heavy losses in manpower and equipment. The French captured hundreds of enemy soldiers and seized some weapons and transportation vehicles for controlling tanks. In the province of Front, the Germans have assembled ten divisions of armored troops and three divisions of mechanized troops, in addition to the infantry, to confront a smaller number of Allied troops. According to French military sources, the German offensive in the area is large in scale, but the results are meager. According to reliable German sources known to the French, the German army has lost 500,000 men since May 10th. (1st, Reuters Telegraph)

### General Gort Arrives Safely in England; Awarded the Grand Cross

London: The War Office announced that General Gort, commander of the British Expeditionary Force, has made good progress in evacuating the Expeditionary Force from France and reducing the number of British troops still in northern France. He has now been ordered by the British government to transfer command of the troops remaining in France to a senior officer of higher rank. After arriving here this morning, the General was received by the King, who awarded him the Grand Cross of the Bath. (1st, Reuters Telegraph)

Allied Evacuation Continues Under Fire

London: Warships, transports, and various other vessels have been crossing the English Channel all night, returning from the front area with British and French troops. This evacuation is proceeding on a large scale today. The trains carrying troops returning from the front are running very smoothly today, arriving at several stations in the London area without stopping. The crowds and women carrying fresh flowers waiting at the stations were quite surprised to see the trains speed by. The troops are in high spirits. The carriage doors are inscribed with slogans such as "Returning home, but not for long" and "Hitler, are you serious? We haven't even started hitting you yet." According to some estimates, only one division of Allied troops remains in the front area. Ships transporting troops back to England immediately depart as soon as they dock, allowing other ships to come alongside. One port had a troop transport vessel quickly approaching. Just as the soldiers had finished disembarking, another ship tied up alongside it before the first ship had even left. This morning, a small boat carrying thirty soldiers, who had escaped Dunkirk under heavy fire without being hit, arrived. Among the troops disembarking this morning were a thousand French soldiers, including French colonial troops. The British did not retreat, so a large number of Allied troops were finally able to break through and turn danger into safety. According to soldiers who recently returned to England, Hitler suffered heavy losses because of his eagerness to encircle in the front area. According to one British soldier, "In one battle, the German casualties must have been over 25,000. Although the German army fell in rows under our fire, they still came like a tide, stepping over the corpses of their comrades." These soldiers who have returned "gloriously" are now on leave for temporary rest, allowing the authorities to adjust important affairs. The UK's immediate priority is whether to retain the full strength of the UK to defend against the expected German offensive, or to send another strong expeditionary force to the continent to help the French army hold the Somme line. Judging from the recent situation, after this great victory, the Germans seem to be intending to put pressure on Paris and may not immediately launch their blitzkrieg against the British Isles. The number of British soldiers who have survived is not yet estimated. It is said that of the original expeditionary force of 400,000 to 500,000, a large part have returned home, and the number who sacrificed in the rearguard battle is acknowledged to be considerable. The French army suffered even greater losses, and it is reported that they are still desperately resisting the German land attack. (1st, International Telegraph)

Germany Boasts of Three Weeks of War Results; Plans to Realize a Quick Victory Strategy

Berlin: Senior German officials yesterday gave a speech to the Haitong News Agency reporter, outlining the results of the German army's three-week offensive on the Western Front as follows: (1) The Belgian army has surrendered. (2) The French 1st, 7th, and 9th Armies have been completely defeated in the front. (3) The British Expeditionary Force has been completely annihilated. (4) The Maginot Line has been broken through, extending 300 kilometers from Dunkirk to Montmédy. (5) The German front line, from Abbeville along the Meuse River to the closest point of Sedan, is only 100 kilometers from Paris. (6) The German army, navy, and air force have reached Calais, the closest part of the English Channel, and control the mouth of the Thames River. The German air force is bombing the enemy's supply lines and industrial production centers. (7) The German front line has shifted 300 kilometers westward, making supply no problem. Not only has the British and French plan to attack Germany's industrial Ruhr area failed, but they have also lost some industrial areas of Belgium and France. (1st, Haitong Telegraph)

Berlin: Military circles here predicted at 8 pm last night that the remnant Allied forces trapped in the front would be annihilated within 24 hours. After the annihilation of these remaining forces, the German army will be free to drive straight towards Paris and London. Authoritative circles say that Germany's victory "has now become a fact." The German army is awaiting orders for a decisive battle. They declared, "No one knows when this order will be issued, but we are certain that this decision will make all previous illusions of military force pale in comparison." They acknowledge that the British Expeditionary Force is stubbornly resisting on a 27-mile deep and six-mile wide stretch of land attached to the Channel port of Dunkirk. However, the German news agency said that the German navy and artillery yesterday attacked the German front along the coast. (Associated Press Telegraph, Day) A soldier on one ship, they fought to the death in the Ypres area and only withdrew yesterday. Another ship carried Allied artillerymen who opened heavy fire until the last minute. (1st, Reuters Telegraph)

Belgian Coastal Towns Turned Into Scorched Earth

London: The largest rearguard battle in history is about to end. Several tens of thousands of British troops have escaped the German trap and returned to England. The German army has used its powerful land and air forces to pounce on the Belgian coast, which has become a scene of scorched earth. But the brave British and French troops are holding the small area around Dunkirk.

### German War Report

Berlin: The German High Command issued a recent communique stating that German forces captured a total of 26,000 enemy soldiers in the Lille area. The German attack on the remnants of the British Expeditionary Force on both sides of Dunkirk met with fierce resistance. Although the terrain is very rugged, they are now gradually pressing forward. The German army sank five enemy transport ships, and three cruisers or destroyers and ten merchant ships were heavily damaged. (1st, Reuters Telegraph)

### Two New Classes of British Recruits Continue to Enlist

London: Two new classes of recruits will enlist in June. Some of them will be assigned to the military industry. Thereafter, the number of active military personnel will increase to 2.8 million, not including the reserve army, naval and air forces, and parachute defense teams. (31st, Havas Telegraph)

Editorial

### The Multi-faceted Struggle in Southeastern Europe

Recently, with the intense progress of the war in Western Europe, Italy's attitude can be described as having exhausted all its evasive tactics. The idea that Italy would join the German side in the war has not only long been rumored around the world, but even newspapers published in Italy itself have been fueling the flames and exaggerating the claim. However, until recently, Italy has still not formally entered the war vortex, one of the main reasons being that there are inevitable contradictions and conflicts between Italy and Germany. The existence of a powerful Germanic state in the north is by no means a blessing for Italy. The thousand years of Italian history before the 19th century is clear evidence of this. Therefore, from a certain point of view, Mussolini is hoping that Hitler will not completely defeat the United Kingdom and France and monopolize Europe. But on the other hand, Italy is, after all, an opportunist country, and its national spirit is rich in foreign aggression. And what Italy is particularly concerned about is that if it maintains its neutrality for a long time, it will reduce its prestige in the international arena of Europe. It will not be able to obtain significant gains in the current European war, nor will it be easy to occupy a controlling position in the future peace conference. Therefore, given that Germany's offensive in the Netherlands and Belgium is currently progressing quite smoothly, Italy's joining the German side to fight against Britain and France is far more likely than its continuing to maintain neutrality. From various aspects, speculating on Italy's future form of participation in the war, it may take the form of a "surprise attack." Its main "surprise" targets would be no more than three: (1) Switzerland or the Franco-Italian border; (2) the British Gibraltar, Malta, and Cyprus Islands, and the French Corsica and Tunisia; (3) the Balkan Peninsula. Of these three, the Balkans are rich in resources and have long been coveted by impoverished Italy.

But the current situation in the Balkans is extremely complicated, which can also be said to be an important reason for Italy's hesitation. When the First World War broke out in 1914, the Balkans were the fuse. In the twenty years after the war, the Balkans themselves remained unstable, and the major European powers also sought to continue developing their influence there in various ways. Since the start of the Second World War last year, the multi-faceted struggle in the Balkan region has intensified even more. One is Germany. Germany's economic relations with Southeast Europe have always been deep. Germany's imports of food and important raw materials can be supplied by the Balkan countries by 50% (except for wool, hemp, rubber, cotton, and coffee). In addition, if Germany wants to defeat Britain, it must not only fight Britain in Western Europe, but also compete with Britain in the Near East and the Middle East. The Balkans are precisely the road that must be passed when it advances. Germany has not abandoned the so-called "Three B Railway" (Berlin - Istanbul - Baghdad) plan. The decision is up to Britain and France. Britain and France have shallower trade relations with Southeastern Europe, but have more industrial investment in the Balkan countries. And if Britain and France want to check Germany from the rear, or want to maintain the freedom of traffic on the Mediterranean Sea, or maintain the security of their Near Eastern oil production areas, they all rely on the friendly neutrality of the Balkan countries. Therefore, after Germany annexed Czechoslovakia last spring, Britain and France immediately issued a statement guaranteeing Greece and Romania, and signed a mutual assistance treaty with Turkey in October. The third is Italy. The Balkan region is the main supplier of food and raw materials for Italy. In military terms, Italy must ensure the security of its east coast and maintain its own traffic to its East African colonies, all of which must first seek to control the Balkans. Therefore, last year, following Germany's annexation of Czechoslovakia, Italy forcibly occupied Albania and sought to interfere in Yugoslavia. Recently, Italian-Yugoslav relations have been very bad. For example, on October 16, Italians held a large-scale anti-Yugoslav demonstration. The fourth is the Soviet Union. Since the end of the First World War, the Soviet Union has adopted a more passive policy towards the Balkans. But the conclusion of the German-Soviet Pact last year strengthened the Soviet Union's position in Southeastern Europe. The Soviet Union has always longed to control the southern gateway of the Black Sea in order to enter and exit the Mediterranean. Now is a good opportunity for her to develop her power. The fifth is Turkey. In the past twenty years, Turkey has been striving for strength and is implicitly the leader of the Balkans. Turkey's policy values diplomacy, but does not rely on external protection. Therefore, in 1934, she united with Greece, Romania, and Yugoslavia to form the Balkan Entente, in order to jointly resist aggression and protect security. In February of this year, the Balkan Entente countries met in the capital of Yugoslavia and reiterated their unwavering commitment to the above-mentioned purpose.

At present, there are at least the above five forces competing in the multi-faceted struggle in Eastern and Western Europe. Among them, Germany and Britain and France are fighting with all their strength in Western Europe, gambling on the fate of their countries. The Balkan countries under the leadership of Turkey are limited by their strength. In terms of speaking out independently, there is still a lack. The remaining major competitors are Italy and the Soviet Union. Yugoslavia is of the same bloodline as the Soviet Union. In view of Italy's extreme pressure, it released its suspicion and reconciled with the Soviet Union last month and signed a commercial agreement. Soviet-Turkish relations have always been cordial. Bulgaria is also a mixed Slavic race, which is congenitally prone to leaning towards the Soviet Union. This is the advantage that the Soviet Union occupies. Germany has always acted as a mediator between the Soviet Union and Italy, attempting to promote their compromise. However, the conflict of interests between the Soviet Union and Italy in Southeastern Europe is not easy to eliminate. This mediation has not been successful to date, and its future is worth paying attention to. Judging from the foreign telegrams obtained in the past twenty-four hours, Italy's entry into the European War is already imminent. If it does, the consequences of this multi-faceted struggle in Southeastern Europe will undoubtedly seriously affect the future development of Anglo-Soviet relations and even the entire European situation.

### Heroic Deeds Will Live Forever; Allied Soldiers Returning Home; Detailed Account of Battlefield Situation; Weary and Sad-Faced; But Their Will Remains Unbroken

London: Today, tens of thousands of British Expeditionary Force soldiers returning from the front passed through here, including many support and home guard service personnel. According to these soldiers speaking to the Reuters interviewer, the casualty ratio between the British Expeditionary Force and the German army is at least one to five. The British army has demonstrated the superiority of its fighting power in battles everywhere. However, every soldier's mouth is filled with the cry of "For God's sake, give us more planes." Although the soldiers have encountered tragic situations, they are weary and sad-faced, and many are still wearing steel helmets with various camouflage materials still attached. However, they are all full of spirit and strong in will. According to some soldiers, they withdrew from Dunkirk through a hail of bullets. The German planes attacked in batches, each up to sixty. Although our army shot down dozens of them, they immediately replenished their numbers and continued bombing. A French ship struck a magnetic mine and sank. Only one of the French soldiers on board swam for a long time and was rescued. It is said that in the past three days, the beaches of Dunkirk and the surrounding sands have been filled with garrison troops waiting to be evacuated. When the German planes hovered in the sky, they dropped bombs and opened machine guns. Yesterday, the troops were attacked by fifty planes, but only one person was killed and one injured, because everyone was hiding in anticipation. The German artillery is now attacking Dunkirk and the surrounding area, so the danger in the area is even greater than before. Many troops mentioned the large number of German tanks and armored vehicles. One young artilleryman said, "We are using field guns like machine guns to bombard them. We can always stop them, but then other tanks suddenly appear on our side, so we have to retreat again to drive them out." One sergeant said that the British army is brave and good at fighting. Even in dangerous situations, they never panic. When each soldier landed at the pier, they threw their rifles on the ground, accumulating several huge piles. (31st, Reuters Telegraph)

London: Hundreds of thousands of British Expeditionary Force soldiers are crossing the English Channel in various ships, returning home one after another and arriving on the southeastern coast. Although they look tired, they are still smiling. Crowds gathered on the beaches and clifftops to greet them with cheers. When the soldiers disembarked and lined up to go to the train station, members of the Women's Voluntary Service Corps, working in eight-hour shifts, shared food, tea, and cigarettes with the soldiers. Some wounded soldiers, lying on stretchers, have also landed. Returning soldiers today talked to guests about their deeds in fighting the superior German army. One soldier said that the troops who boarded the ship in Dunkirk early yesterday morning were heavily bombarded by German long-range guns, which hit several times. However, the British and French navies completely control the city. The city is constantly being bombarded and bombed, and fires are breaking out in many places. Few houses are left. Other soldiers also described the dense attack of 200 German planes, saying that the Royal Air Force and anti-aircraft guns shot down many enemy planes. An officer who just returned to England from Dunkirk today told a Reuters reporter that the German plane bombing has a deafening effect, but the loss of life is minimal. This point has been confirmed from many sources. The officer also said that the German soldiers, once away from their tanks, are no longer as fierce as the German soldiers in the previous Great War. One officer said that the area is full of spies. He said that when he was about to board the ship at the beach, someone wearing a British officer's uniform approached him and spoke fluent English, saying that he needed to order his troops to move two more miles along the beach. Just as he was about to give the order, he met a naval officer who told him that there was no order to move the troops. An hour later, the location two miles away had been bombed to pieces. London naval circles say that the cooperation between the navy, army, and air force was extremely satisfactory when the troops were evacuated from the Belgian coast. Moreover, the warships and other vessels evacuated were working in shallow water, often suffering from poor lighting and the most intense bombing imaginable. Therefore, sailing and driving ships in narrow spaces required skilled techniques. It is reported that the protection given to the ships by the planes was very effective. (1st, Reuters Telegraph)

### British Press Praises

LONDON - This morning, various newspapers here in London, when reporting on the miracle of the British forces in northern France escaping forced surrender or annihilation, used unusually cheerful language, unseen for many days. All newspapers gave the news headlines in large font, such as "British Air Force Turns Defeat into Victory" and "Retreat More Successful Than Expected." The Times stated that the most difficult and dangerous military operation is undoubtedly covering the embarkation of the majority of troops under artillery fire. The difficulty of this kind of military action is even greater in the era of mechanized warfare and aerial bombardment, as all movements cannot be hidden from the enemy's eyes. Troops were embarking amidst a hail of bullets, and the terrain was mostly exposed beaches. The Navy, except for destroyers, could not use larger warships. Maintaining resistance under the aforementioned unfavorable circumstances depended on the perfect understanding and cooperation of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, as well as allied nations including Belgian troops who refused to lay down their arms, to be effective. One thing is most important: the troops currently being transported back to England are not like fugitives from a failed campaign, but an entire unbroken unit. Although the number has decreased, their discipline has been tempered by the experiences of war and is as strong as steel. After necessary rest, they will be ready to undertake new tasks in the war. The situation is similar for French army corps that need to travel further to designated ports for embarkation, but the number of arrivals is increasing daily. The Daily Telegraph reported that the heroic feat completed by the Allied forces this time, which is hard to believe, will be listed as one of the most famous and glorious battles of the British Army. The Daily Mail reported that the retreat from the front has written an immortal history of heroism and perseverance. The News Chronicle stated that the facts of this retreat provide a new interpretation of the old debate between warships and aircraft. The countless ships that participated in assisting this retreat also suffered minor damage. If it were not for the almost superhuman achievements of the British Air Force, the losses would undoubtedly have been much greater than at present. However, the numerically superior Nazi air force did not prevent the retreat from proceeding. (Reuter's dispatch of the 1st)

### German Troops Charge, Tanks Equipped with Sharp Blades

LONDON - According to a British artilleryman arriving here, speaking to a reporter from the Associated Press, he was still fighting on the Ypres front four days ago. He and other soldiers had provided artillery cover for the Allied forces for 36 hours. During the artillery bombardment, they had even heard the Germans requesting a brief pause to bury the dead. They continued firing for another six hours after hearing this request, with the artillery fire becoming even more intense than before. From his perspective, the German losses must have been very heavy. Another British soldier said that German tanks charged and crashed into everything regardless of any obstacles ahead, never stopping slightly. Their giant tanks were equipped with sharp blades to cut down obstacles. The most difficult places were opened up by these blades. Soldiers arriving here yesterday praised the Allied fleet's assistance in the evacuation work. (Associated Press dispatch of the 1st)

### British Press on Modern Warfare: Naval Power Still Important

LONDON - An editorial in The Times, titled "The Grasp of the Ocean," emphasized that while the power of the air force has increased in this war, naval power still occupies an important position. It stated, "One must never forget that the real struggle is for control of the ocean. The enemy is now sparing no effort to rush towards the ports of the English Channel, which shows that they have not forgotten the main obstacle to world domination. Naval power today is even more powerful than in the past. Modern armies, whether on the ground or in the air, cannot move or fight without being supplied from afar." (Reuter's dispatch of the 1st)

### US Chargé d'Affaires to Germany Returns Home

WASHINGTON - US Secretary of State Hull told reporters temporarily that the US Chargé d'Affaires to Germany, Kirk, is now starting his return to the country, on award of leave, and will not return to his post immediately. (Agence de France-Presse dispatch of the 1st)

### Belgian Parliament Passes Motion: Condemns Leopold for Surrendering to the Enemy, Considers Him Legally Unable to Reclaim the Throne, Prime Minister Declares Resolution to Fight Freely to the End

PARIS - In a moving and memorable meeting last night, the Belgian Parliament unanimously passed a motion declaring that it adopts the same attitude as the Belgian government, recognizing that King Leopold can no longer legally and morally reclaim the throne. The motion was passed unanimously by all 89 members of the House of Representatives and 54 Senators present, with no dissenters. In addition to the above, its content further stipulates: (1) condemning King Leopold's surrender, the historical responsibility for which should be borne by him alone; (2) paying tribute to the soldiers who died defending Belgium's independence; (3) expressing admiration for the Belgian army that has suffered unexpected pain; (4) believing deeply that Belgian youth will soon restore our flag to the front lines; (5) expressing fervent sympathy to the compatriots in the occupied areas of Belgium, believing that their patriotic spirit has not wavered. The resolution declares the determination to continue fighting alongside the Allied powers with all the troops of Belgium and its colonies to resist the enemy's aggression, and will not stop until the goal of restoring the country is achieved. Finally, it expresses deep gratitude to Britain and France for accommodating Belgian refugees, and reiterates the firm belief that justice and glory will ultimately prevail. Belgian Senate President Gysels confirmed the fact that some Belgian troops had refused to obey King Leopold's surrender order and were fighting alongside Allied forces in northern France. According to reports, the above meeting was of a semi-official nature and was held in Limoges, France, to report the government's actions to members of both houses of parliament. It is said that there are currently only about 150 Belgian senators in France, which is less than half of the total, so it is impossible to change the two-thirds majority required by Italian law. Although this meeting was of an informal nature, the atmosphere of the venue will occupy an important place in the history of the Belgian Parliament. The Mayor of Limoges gave a welcoming speech at the opening of the meeting, concluding by saying, "We must win so that your beloved Belgium can return to strength and freedom. After the victory of the Allied forces, freedom may not disappear from mankind." After the Mayor finished speaking, the crowd thanked France, and many Belgians were moved to tears. The Presidents of the Belgian Senate and House of Representatives and Prime Minister Pierlot successively spoke, expressing Belgium's determination to fight alongside the Allied forces until freedom is restored. During their speeches, people shouted slogans such as "Long Live France" and "Long Live Belgium." (Reuter's dispatch of the 1st)

### Air Battle over Dunkirk: British and German Air Forces Clash, One Against Four, Twelve German Planes Destroyed, French Planes Bombard German Troops Vigorously in the Somme Area

LONDON - Yesterday evening, a British fighter patrol clashed with enemy aircraft over Dunkirk, attacking forty German Meuserschmitt 109s, while being attacked by another forty Meuserschmitt-style planes and several Heinkel fighters. Although the number of British planes was only a quarter of the enemy's, in a fierce battle they not only preserved their own planes, but also shot down twelve enemy planes. When the British planes returned to defense, several had bullet marks, but they were quickly repaired and refueled, ready for the next offensive patrol. (Reuter's dispatch of the 1st)

PARIS - A communiqué from the French Air Ministry stated that yesterday evening, a French fighter squadron conducted reconnaissance flights over the Dunkirk area, and bomber squadrons attacked enemy troops near the Abbeville Somme Canal, inflicting heavy casualties. All French planes returned safely. Another group of French bombers attacked enemy troops north of Amiens, dropping more than twenty tons of bombs. One French plane did not return. Last night, our bomber squadron dropped military supplies and other supplies by parachute to support the Allied forces. (Reuter's dispatch of the 1st)

### Joint British and French Military Conference Held in Paris Yesterday: Reviews General Situation

LONDON - The Supreme Council of War met in Paris yesterday. A communiqué issued after the meeting stated that the Supreme Military Council met in Paris on May 31. The British attendees were Prime Minister Churchill, Lord Privy Seal Attlee, Sir Campbell, General Dill, General Ismay, and General Spears. The French attendees were Premier Reynaud, Marshal Pétain, Admiral Darlan, and Baudouin. The meeting reviewed the general situation and reached complete agreement on all measures required by the current situation. This meeting fully demonstrates the unwavering determination of the Allied governments and people to cooperate in the war to achieve complete victory. This was Churchill's first attendance since taking office as Prime Minister, and Attlee's first participation in the meeting. General Spears is the Chairman of the British-French Parliamentary Committee, sometimes referred to as the British Member of Parliament stationed in Paris. General Ismay is a member of the Chiefs of Staff Committee chaired by Churchill. Baudouin is the leader of France's economic warfare efforts. (Reuter's dispatch of the 1st)

### France Announces Revocation of Decoration Awarded to the King of Belgium

PARIS - The French government had previously awarded the Grand Cross of the Legion of Honour to King Leopold III of Belgium. Due to the King of Belgium's surrender to Germany, the decoration has now been revoked. (Havas dispatch of the 1st)

### Espionage Case Cracked in London

LONDON - A woman and two men were detained for violating the National Defence Act. When their case was tried in Plymouth yesterday, the details were shocking. The woman's name is Inkerlem, 42 years old. Her husband is currently a sergeant in the Royal Air Force, and she is related to a staff officer in the German High Command by marriage. She is accused of seeking to obtain information about tanks to supply to the enemy. The two men, Swift, 57 years old, and Wasser, 40 years old, are both accomplices. The woman obtained British citizenship by marrying an Englishman. Her parents are both German and quite anti-British. She currently works in the home of a senior naval officer who holds an important position in the Admiralty. The woman often made anti-British statements, and once told him that when the German army entered Britain, the British royal family and cabinet members would be publicly executed, and Sir Mosley, the leader of the British Fascist Party, would be the ruler of England. The prosecuting attorney stated in court that if the woman's crimes had been discovered a week later, she would have been sentenced to death. (Reuter's dispatch of the 1st)

WASHINGTON - Today, the State Department announced that American nationals in the Mediterranean area will be completely evacuated. It is said that the steamer Washington, currently carrying American nationals from Bordeaux and Lisbon back to the country, may sail to Genoa if there is still space.

The bill has been passed by the House of Representatives, and because the Senate has made amendments, it is planned to resubmit the bill to the House of Representatives for amendment. (1st, United Press)

Washington - President Roosevelt yesterday submitted a supplementary emergency program of more than 1 billion yuan to Congress and requested immediate discussion without delay. According to President Roosevelt, due to the "almost unbelievable" events that have occurred in Europe in the past two weeks, especially as a result of the use of aviation and mechanical equipment, this recent expansion of the program is necessary. There is a possibility that not only one or two continents but all continents will be involved in a worldwide war. If this continues, the United States must make its defense more solid to seek reasonable protection. Official sources then stated that the defense expenditures proposed by President Roosevelt to be increased total 700 million yuan for the army and 675 million yuan for the navy. (1st, Reuters)

### US Senator Townsend Reintroduces Silver Bill - Removes Tax Regulations

Washington - Senator Townsend has reintroduced his famous silver bill to the Senate after amending it and removing the tax regulations. According to the previous discussion of the bill in the House of Representatives, because the Italian law stipulates that all taxation systems must be done by the House of Representatives, the bill contained tax clauses, which hindered the legal rights of the House of Representatives. Therefore, the leaders decided by a vote of 45 to 36 to return the bill to the Senate. According to the bill, the right to purchase foreign silver under the Silver Purchase Act of 1934 is terminated, and a 50% tax is levied on all silver transfers. However, this plan does not prevent the purchase of limited silver previously promised or opened by the equalization fund. (31st, Reuters)

Previously, there were more than 30,000 people, and another 30,000 will be sent this year. As for the economic development of the South Pacific islands, it is extremely important and is a source of raw materials. At this time when the "China Incident" has developed and the international situation is becoming increasingly tense, Japan's expansion there must be handled with caution. (31st, Havas)

London - It is heard that the British-Italian negotiations on the contraband control agreement have broken down. (1st, Reuters)

London - British and Italian discussions on trade relations and the blockade had reached a compromise in principle, but the Italian side suddenly suspended negotiations on May 28. Political figures here commented that the Italian authorities do not want to ease relations with Britain and France and have decided to end their non-belligerent policy and participate in the war in some form, but the date has not yet been decided. According to a certain observer, the Italian authorities may continue to blackmail for some time in the hope that Britain and France will concede again. However, Britain and France have adopted a firm attitude and cannot negotiate with Italy. They will inevitably put pressure on Italy in economic and financial aspects, and Italy's blackmail strategy will only see its efforts exhausted. In short, Britain and France have taken all preventive measures in all aspects and can cope with any eventuality. (31st, Havas)

London - Surprise has been expressed here at the news of the Italian government's decisive rejection of the principles agreed upon in the recent talks in Rome. These talks were initiated by the Italian government and resulted in the drafting of a solution that would have provided a completely satisfactory solution to the Italian side's dissatisfaction with contraband control. As the naval permit system has been expanded, there will be no interference with or actual interference with Italian ships passing through British control stations. As for the Italian side, it recognizes in principle that it will not transport certain types of imported goods to the enemy as an exchange condition. Certain detailed issues remain to be discussed and there is no reason to believe that these issues will lead to any difficulties or delays. However, Italy's decision does not appear to be due to any actual issues currently under consideration. According to a telecommunication from Rome, Italy's sudden change is due to the intervention of extremely high aspects. It is unwise for us to speculate what the omen of this attitude is before we receive an explanation. (1st, Reuters)

Italian Public Opinion Attitude - Advocates War Against Britain and France

Rome - The semi-official magazine "International Relations" published an article stating: "The opportunity we have been waiting for for fifty years has now arrived. The Italian people will fight the two enemies, France and England, with the greatest determination until complete victory. Italy's demands on the Mediterranean are only asking for natural rights. Italy's military and political powers rely on the Mediterranean. France and England alone can hold the political power of the Mediterranean, and thus implement control over Italy's development. This is illogical. Since France and England deny Italy's demands, Italy will take them by force. The era of emotional and useless imitation has passed. Today, the only imitation that is important is the supreme interests of the Italian people. The Italian people are a nation of laborers. This characteristic gives them the undeniable right. Those who are selfish and possess abundant resources and refuse to make public distributions must give them up today. The eyes of the Italians are increasingly focused on Tunis, the right to support people there was built by the hard work of several generations of Italian farmers, and on Corsica and Nice, which are traditionally owned by Italians and should be returned to Italians according to the needs of national security. Also, they are focused on Djibouti and Suez, whose wealth was created by the Italian Empire and developed by Italian industry. The people ruled by Mussolini today are able to undertake the great task of the highest glory of national revival. The land, sea, and air forces of Fascist Italy today all abide by this statement."

### Spanish Newspaper Demands Return of Gibraltar - Madrid Students Protest Against Britain

Madrid - The Spanish Falangist newspaper "Arriba" recently published an article demanding that Britain return Gibraltar to Spain. It said, "The British side, because it has signed a commercial agreement with our country and lent millions of pounds to our country, believes that the relations between the two countries are completely friendly. However, our country is not satisfied with this. What our country wants is to recover the port of Gibraltar. If there is a Gibraltar issue between Britain and France, it will be difficult to be completely harmonious. The port was originally our country's territory, and no foreign flag should be allowed to fly there except for our country's flag. In addition, we must declare that our raising this demand is not due to the current European war, nor is it related to the sound of bombs heard by Britain at the port of Calais in France and other ports along the English Channel. In short, it would be wise for Britain to voluntarily return Gibraltar to our country." (31st, Havas)

Madrid - Madrid University students gathered in front of the British Embassy to protest, shouting "Gibraltar is Spanish territory." This demonstration was clearly intended to coincide with the arrival of Sir Samuel Hoare, who was here on a special mission from the British government to negotiate. Spanish newspapers have been reporting on the movement to return Gibraltar to Spain for the past two days. (1st, Reuters)

### Hungarian Prime Minister Discusses the European Situation

Hungarian Capital - Hungarian Prime Minister Teleki met with reporters yesterday and made a statement on the tense situation in Europe, declaring that Hungary need not worry, because our silence has helped the Allied Powers of Germany and Italy maintain order and peace in the Balkans and the Danube Basin. The preventive measures we have taken, at home and abroad, can be understood. The general concern that the European war will be prolonged is now unlikely, because the victories won by the German army may end the war in a short period of time. This must be welcomed by all small countries. If the war is prolonged, even if small countries can maintain neutrality, they will not be able to sustain it economically for a long time.

### India to Continue Expanding Army - Air Force to Increase Fourfold

Simla - General Cassels, Commander-in-Chief of the Indian Garrison, declared last night that the Indian Army would continue to increase by about 100,000 people. The new army of India in the future will include motorized and mechanized units. The Indian Air Force will also increase fourfold. The current situation in France shows that the war is in danger of spreading. India will inevitably be affected by the enemy's actions. The defense forces will continue to be strengthened. British and Indian officers will step up training, and the production of ammunition will be accelerated. Since the outbreak of the war, the Indian regular army has already undergone its first expansion, increasing by more than 53,000 people. (1st, Reuters)

### Record of the Mission of Disgrace to Germany (Part 2)

— Abridged Translation of Sir Nevile Henderson's Original Work

In May, at a banquet hosted by the Anglo-German Association, I delivered a pro-German speech, attempting to improve Anglo-German relations. This was the first instance of my taking matters into my own hands. The second was my participation in the Nuremberg National Socialist Party Congress in September. The ambassadors of Great Britain, France, and the United States had always regarded this congress as an informal gathering related only to the party headquarters, and each time excused themselves from attending. At the 1937 Congress, I, along with French Ambassador François-Poncet, and American Chargé d'Affaires Gilbert, attended at the direction of our respective governments, limiting our time to two days. Hitler was very pleased to see the diplomatic representatives of Great Britain, France, and the United States attending together, and was particularly fond of me personally, knowing that this was at my instigation.

During a luncheon, I had a long conversation with Propaganda Minister Goebbels about the issue of mutual attacks in the newspapers of our two countries. Although there was nothing new in what was discussed, no good solution was ever found. However, Dr. Goebbels' attitude was reasonable and amiable, which was commendable. He was known as "Little Doctor," and intellectually, he was indeed one of the brightest stars among the National Socialist Party leaders. He never gave speeches? He loved to argue, and in private conversation, he was fair-minded. I enjoyed talking to him. Judging by his appearance, he was a typical Irish agitator. Born in the Rhineland, he studied at a Catholic Jesuit school. He was small and slightly lame, but his courage in fighting the communists in Berlin was extraordinary. When he took to debating or writing, all his words, no matter how vicious or deceitful, were always at his disposal.

I then had a long talk with Aviation Minister Göring. Although the issue of the annexation of Austria was touched upon, most of the time was spent urging him to list the specific facts of the so-called attempts by England to encircle Germany, and what Germany's ultimate goals were. I had already requested a written answer to this question in July. Although Göring was always ready to talk to me and was willing to express his opinions, pending "Hitler's approval," such a written answer was ultimately a pipe dream. However, during this conversation, Göring invited me to go hunting in Rominten, East Prussia, in early October, saying that there might be news to tell me then. I readily agreed.

Göring was often frank and sometimes even indignant, but my interactions with him were open and honest, and our attitudes were always very harmonious. He was not as constantly driven by personal grievances as Hitler and Ribbentrop. He genuinely wanted to live in peace and have good relations with England, but he also warned me that if the British Empire did not cooperate with Germany, Germany would have no choice but to destroy it.

Whether he instigated the Reichstag fire in 1933, or whether Hitler entrusted him with overseeing the large-scale purge in Berlin during the 1934 purge, Göring, although perhaps the most sympathetic among the National Socialist Party leaders in peacetime, was as cruel as in war in times of crisis. He once told me that the Englishman he admired was the type of Drake, a "pirate-like figure," and that modern Englishmen had lost too much of their strength. In fact, he was also a typical pirate, but he had many endearing qualities, and I personally liked him the most.

There were many anecdotes about Göring, mostly making fun of his love of medals, but none of them were too serious. In my view, he did his best to mediate for peace in 1938, and if his courage and strength of character could have been matched by his physical exuberance, he might still have been able to save the situation in 1939.

In early October, I went to Rominten, East Prussia, for a hunt. Göring was very hospitable. The villa was thatched, and the interior was comfortably equipped with everything one could need. The attendants were all maids, with only one male servant. The guests and host were informal in their comings and goings. I drove up as the sun was shining faintly, and we prepared to go hunting together at four o'clock in the afternoon. As we set off, Göring teased me, saying that although Englishmen were good at using shotguns, they did not know how to use rifles. A week earlier, he had invited an English hunter to hunt deer, and he had missed three times.

I felt like cold water had been poured over my head when I heard this, but I was not discouraged. When we reached the forest, I caught sight of a deer, and I shot it through the heart. The next morning, I shot another one, and the English reputation for being good hunters was preserved. I stayed for two days, enjoying myself so much that I forgot to return. In nature, there is no such thing as nationalism or socialism. The only feeling is that all human beings are equal.

Earlier, Göring had planned to hold a hunting exhibition in Berlin in November 1937. I learned after taking office that almost all European countries were preparing to participate, except for England. I urgently telegraphed the Foreign Office, requesting that preparations be made to join. Although it was late, we managed to catch up.

The Germans were very organized, and the hunting exhibition was a great success. Although Hitler did not like hunting and opposed the killing of animals in principle, he reluctantly attended. Göring was very pleased that England participated.

There is one thing in particular related to this exhibition that is worth mentioning, namely, that Lord Halifax, the Lord Privy Seal (who had already been appointed Foreign Secretary), was able to take the opportunity to visit Berlin. To avoid external misunderstandings, this trip was presented as being of a personal nature. The person behind this was Mr. Chamberlain, who intended to promote friendship between the two countries by taking advantage of the opportunity for important figures from England and Germany to interact with each other. His intentions were good.

Hitler was deeply impressed by Lord Halifax's vision and sincerity. The general public in Germany also felt that this trip was a sufficient indication of England's sincerity towards Germany. However, those in the party and government circles remained indifferent. Afterwards, Göring asked me, "Is Prime Minister Chamberlain really sincere? Can he really change the anti-National Socialist sentiment in England? Can he really avoid copying the old articles of the League of Nations, collective security, and France's policy of encirclement?" This was the orthodox view in Germany of British policy. Although Hitler had repeatedly declared that he was willing to reconcile with England, he was all talk and no action. He knew that he had pressing matters such as the annexation of Austria, so how could he sacrifice his Central European ambitions to gain such understanding? The Anglo-German reconciliation that he had in mind was simply England accepting his plan to transform Central Europe.

On January 12, 1938, the German newspapers revealed that Defense Minister Werner von Blomberg was marrying a woman named Fräulein Gruhn, which was the prelude to a tragedy within Germany, not to put it too strongly. The previous evening, I had been invited to a banquet at the Propaganda Ministry by Funk, the current Minister of Economic Affairs and President of the Central Bank. At the end of the banquet, Funk announced the marriage of General von Blomberg and Fräulein Gruhn. Everyone present, about sixty people, was stunned and asked about Fräulein Gruhn's background. It was soon learned that the political police had a record of her. She was a dissolute and beautiful woman. I privately surmised that this was probably the work of the sinister political police chief Himmler, hoping to eliminate dissidents.

Hitler's personal feelings and his reputation were greatly affected by this. Blomberg was not only one of Hitler's most trusted men, but disaster struck close to home. Hitler intended to use the excuse that Blomberg had been fooled by someone and sarcastically ordered him to dissolve the marriage. Blomberg refused to listen, and Hitler felt a sense of being abandoned by his followers.

The National Socialist Party was on good terms with Blomberg and initially had no reservations about him, but the army generals were not. The radicals in the party were also at odds with him because of his interference in military affairs. Army Commander-in-Chief General von Fritsch, supported by the generals and the veteran generals of the previous war, such as Mackensen, reported directly to the Führer without waiting for Hitler to take action, saying that Blomberg, as Minister of Defense, was marrying a libertine woman, and military discipline was gone, which was intolerable. However, how could a dictator tolerate being commanded by others? Hitler, on the one hand, did not want to be controlled by others, and on the other hand, wanted to show his friendship to his old friend, so he initially firmly refused to dismiss Blomberg. Fritsch went further, not only criticizing the issue of military discipline, but also criticizing Hitler's foreign policy, especially his policy towards Austria. This was something that Hitler could not tolerate.

Later, Fritsch left his post, as did Blomberg. At that time, what Hitler was thinking about deeply was how to deal with the situation in a way that would benefit him, or at least not lose face. Three weeks later, on February 4, after his first major outburst of anger that year, Hitler announced the dismissal of these two important figures, and at the same time used the transfer and promotion of army, navy, air force, and diplomatic personnel as a smokescreen. Except for the diplomatic circles, the transfer of this group of personnel, other than the dismissal of Fritsch and Blomberg, did not attract much attention. The remaining people would be transferred months later. Afterwards, Hitler seized military power. In general, Hitler's means of overcoming difficulties cannot be said to have been slow, and he swept away the imperialist conservatives in the army. Conservative Foreign Minister Neurath was also replaced by the extremist Ribbentrop. (To be continued)

### International Track and Field Meet Opens Yesterday, Chinese Team Shows Strength, Western Police Lead, Chinese Team Third, Fonseca Sets New Long Jump Record, Finals Next Saturday

The 1940 Chinese-Western Group Track and Field Meet, organized by the Shanghai International Track and Field Association, opened at the American School yesterday at 2:00 PM. Participating units held preliminary and final rounds for fourteen events. The early summer weather was sunny and warm, with a suitable temperature, making it the best season for track and field. The scene on Avenue Petain was lively. The Western Police led with twenty-two points, followed by the Western Youth with nineteen points, and the Chinese United Team with ten points in third place. The finals are scheduled for next Saturday at the same location. The results were good, with Fonseca's long jump of twenty-two feet ten inches (6.97 meters) breaking his own meeting record of twenty-two feet seven and three-eighths inches. The pole vault was postponed to the finals next Saturday due to the lack of poles. The preliminary round of the intermediate hurdles will be re-run at the American School at 5:00 PM on Wednesday due to procedural deficiencies during roll call.

### Team Scores

Western Police 22 School Federation 2 points

Western Youth 19 Pui Tak 2 points

Chinese United 10 Western Force 0 points

McLane 6 Jewish 0 points

East Selah 5 points

### Race Report

Among the five finals held yesterday, the long jump was the best, with champion Fonseca breaking the meeting record of twenty-two feet ten inches, which he already held. Western Youth's Mantos Li won both the shot put and javelin, but his performance seemed weaker than in the past. In the one-mile race, where many heroes gathered, Xiong Wang Zhenglin, with his outstanding ability, led by nearly one hundred yards to win the championship in four minutes and thirty-nine seconds. He missed his own meeting record of four minutes and thirty-six and six tenths seconds by less than three seconds. Guan Youwen was still in second place at the last five yards, but was overtaken by Western Youth's Servis in the last three yards, falling to third place by a shoulder, which was a pity. However, famous athletes such as East Selah's Clemens Dimock and the School Federation's Wallace were all lapped by more than one lap. In the relay, the loss came from poor deployment of the team. In the preliminary and semi-final rounds, Edward showed his strength in the short-distance 100-yard and 220-yard races. Fonseca did not use his full strength. Wang Zhenshi and Chen Yongfu of the Chinese United team were both selected in the preliminary rounds, but were eliminated in the semi-finals. In the 440-yard race, Chinese United's famous athlete Dai Shuguo only participated in the one-mile relay yesterday and did not participate in his signature event, so he was not on the list either. In the preliminary round of the high hurdles, Li Zhenzhong won the first place in the second group with seventeen and seven tenths seconds, so there is high hope in the finals next week.

### International Mini-Soccer Preliminary Round, China Wins 7-1 Against Jewish, China, England, Portugal, and France Enter the Replay Week, Four Teams Compete for the Finals Title Today

The international mini-soccer tournament with eight teams competing opened in the preliminary round yesterday. As a result, China, England, Portugal, and France all predictably advanced to the replay week with easy victories. Today, the English team, which struggled to win yesterday, will face the tough Portuguese team again, and it is difficult to predict the outcome, since Portugal, still basking in glory from the International Cup soccer championship, also has profound abilities in mini-soccer and is not only determined to win, but is also quite confident. This match between England and Portugal should be one of the most exciting games of the season. After the England-Portugal match, the Chinese team will play the French Commerce team. The French team is loud and powerful, and they also feel that the Chinese team is difficult to deal with, so the Chinese team's lineup today, in addition to the usual defense, will have center forward Sun Jinshun personally leading the team in order to increase the offensive. Both big matches will be exciting. The schedule for today and yesterday's results are as follows:

Today's Schedule

England vs. Portugal (Replay) 3:30 PM

China vs. France (Replay) 4:50 PM

(Note) The Jewish vs. Russian B group final originally scheduled to be held today has been changed to next Sunday.

Yesterday's Results

France def. Scotland 6-2

England def. Russia 4-3

Portugal def. Philippines 7-1

China def. Jewish 7-1

China vs. Jewish In the match against China, the Jewish team was arrogant and overconfident, but their skills were just so-so. The Chinese team's strength was sharp and powerful, and the Jewish team paled in comparison. Just as they got on the field, Chinese general Xiao Xintian was injured in a collision, so Gao Baozheng replaced him and scored two goals in a row. Chen Yuanji added icing to the cake, and the Chinese team led with three to zero in the first half, taking an absolute advantage. After switching sides, the Chinese team continued to work hard, and Gao Baozheng scored two more goals. After making it six to zero, the Jewish team finally pulled back one goal, but Meng Yiliang immediately retaliated. In the end, the Chinese team won with seven to one.

The Remaining Three Matches The situation was very different in the France vs. Scotland match. Kaolet and Bu Suli each scored a hat trick before the Scottish team cracked their own egg (scored a goal). In the second half, the French team quickly scored three more goals, and the Scottish team suffered a crushing defeat by two to six. The strength of Portugal and the Philippines was very different, forming a situation of egg against stone. The Philippines lost three goals in the first half, and then conceded three more in the second half before finally scoring, and then adding one more for a big win of seven to one. Fafan Xiao scored four goals. The Russian team was just starting, and they initially gave the English team an intimidating start. Later, the English team scored three goals in a row, and the Russian team forced the score to be tied at three each, making the situation even more tense. After struggling, the English team finally scored through McLaughland and eliminated the Russian team with a score of four to three.

### Overview of the Central Government's Assistance to Refugee Children over the Past Three Years (Part 2) Receiving Over 30,000 People

Relief Funds The emergency rescue of refugee children and the establishment of educational and care institutions are handled by the National Relief Commission. The funds are directly allocated by the commission. For those handled by local governments, the funds are allocated by the local governments. Various refugee children relief organizations raise funds from enthusiastic people from home and abroad to rescue refugee children and establish educational and care institutions. If the funds raised are insufficient and cannot cover the expenses, they may apply for subsidies from the National Relief Commission. If the local government's financial resources are insufficient, it may also apply for subsidies. The National Relief Commission has also formulated measures for refugee children relief organizations to apply for subsidies. The National Relief Commission has allocated over 3.8 million yuan for refugee children relief in the 28th and 29th years.

Educational and Care Overview Children are divided into infants and school-age children, and appropriate education and care are provided for each stage. Training focuses on cultivating habits of cleanliness and hygiene, as well as the spirit of labor. Group life guidance is provided. For older children, emphasis is placed on imparting practical skills, such as using farms as agricultural training centers, where they are taught gardening and animal husbandry. Factories are used as training centers for small-scale crafts, such as simple chemical crafts, making tofu, soy sauce, soap, and other chemical products. Simple bamboo and woodworking, mechanical printing, etc., are selected based on environmental needs. Stores and cooperatives are set up, paying attention to bookkeeping, accounting, and business training. In terms of household affairs, such as sewing and cooking, children are trained. All facilities contain elements of shame education and war preparedness. Older children also receive military education and participate in Boy Scout training. The class system is the same as in ordinary elementary schools. Grades one to four are elementary, and grades five and six are advanced. Each grade has a standard of 30 to 50 students. For children whose age and academic level are too far apart, and for children who cannot continue their education after graduating from elementary school, vocational classes are set up separately, divided into crafts, agriculture, business, and household affairs groups according to their nature. Vocational classes are divided into high and elementary levels according to the children's skills, and the duration of study is two years. If necessary, it can be extended by one year. The association stipulated last year that the monthly cost for each refugee child was 8.2 yuan (5 yuan for food, 1 yuan for daily necessities, 50 cents for school supplies, 1 yuan for medical expenses, 50 cents for miscellaneous expenses, and 2 yuan for education). Currently, due to soaring prices, the association has slightly increased the living expenses for refugee children. (The End)

### Education Director Xu Discusses the Zhejiang Provincial Joint Examination Issue, Random Examinations for Junior High School Graduates, Sending Staff to Local Examinations for Senior High School Students

(Yongkang Dispatch) Zhejiang Education Director Xu Shaodi came to Yongkang on official business. When asked by reporters whether the Zhejiang Province will follow the Ministry of Education's order to hold a joint examination for this year's middle school graduates, he replied as follows: Zhejiang Province is also included in the joint examination for middle school graduates in fifteen provinces this year, according to reports from Chongqing, but the department has not yet received a formal order. It is found that 12 high schools in Zhejiang Province will have graduating classes this semester, with a total of over 400 students. The schools are distributed in eleven counties including Yin County, Shaoxing, Sheng County, Tiantai, Xianju, Jinhua, Qu County, Qing Tian, and Lishui. 53 junior high schools, with a total of over 1100 students, are distributed in 32 counties including Xiaofeng, Yuqian, Cixi, Fenghua, Zhuji, Xinchang, Ninghai, Linhai, Dongyang, Jiangshan, Jiande, Yongjia, Chun'an, Ruian, and Songyang. Zhejiang Province is located on the front line, and transportation is extremely inconvenient, especially in the counties close to the war zone. If all students are concentrated for the joint examination, there will be many difficulties, and there will be many financial difficulties for the students. It is intended to follow the Ministry's supplementary measures: conduct random examinations for junior high schools, and send staff to local examinations for each high school. However, this method will increase the difficulties for the department itself.

### French Ambassador About to Travel North - Suggestion of Conciliation is Absurd - Policy Towards China Consistent and Unchanging - French Concession Well-Guarded, Security Not a Concern - American University Professor Advocates Active Sanctions Against Japan

Recently, the local area has been affected by the expansion of the European war and rumors from certain parties. The general public is in a state of panic and suspicion. A reporter from the Pingming News Agency visited the spokesperson of the French Embassy yesterday to inquire about various matters and received a sincere response. According to the spokesperson, France is a democratic country, and China is also a democratic country. The friendship between the two countries has been very close in the past. The rumor that the French Ambassador suggested conciliation is absolutely absurd.

Foreign Ministry Denies Peace with Japan

A United Press International dispatch from Chongqing on the 1st reported that the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently firmly denied the rumors from Rome that the Chinese ambassadors to the United Kingdom, France, and Germany had jointly suggested an early peace with Japan to join the Axis powers of the European war. The spokesperson stated that not only have Chinese ambassadors abroad not made such a suggestion, but also China's policy has not changed since the outbreak of the European war. The spokesperson believes that the news from Rome must have come from Japan, seeking to confuse the world.

Traveling North and Returning South, Then Proceeding to Chongqing

Expressing the utmost sympathy for China's current situation, the French government will by no means change its consistent policy in the past. The Nanjing organization was created by the Japanese side. The Japanese have not even recognized it. How can they recognize others? The current ambassador is in Shanghai for the summer, simply inspecting the local French diplomatic agencies' office situation as usual. He may travel to Pingjin this month or next month to visit friends. Once he returns south, he will still go to Chongqing, where the central government is located. The rumor that the French ambassador is advising President Chiang for peace is simply not credible.

French Concession Maintaining Neutrality

As for the security of the French Concession in this city, there is absolutely no cause for concern. The French defense forces and police force stationed in Shanghai can cope with any unfortunate accidents from the outside. The protection measures in various places have been strengthened recently, such as waterworks, power plants, and all public utilities. Although some bad elements and the so-called German "Fifth Column" are trying to disrupt, they will certainly not succeed. The French Concession is strictly adhering to a neutral attitude. Even the more than four hundred German residents living within the concession will be tolerated as long as they live and work in peace and do not participate in any anti-British or anti-French political activities. They will continue to be allowed to reside without interference.

Japan Hopes to End the China Incident

According to an article entitled "Japan and the Nanjing Regime" published in the June issue of the English "Oriental Affairs" magazine edited by H. G. W. Woodnead of this city, Woodnead first stated in this article that Japan's recognition of the Nanjing organization is still pending. Although Abe and many of his subordinates arrived in Ning on April 23, they did not occupy a prominent position in news reports. Therefore, a certain Japanese newspaper criticized this and stated that it earnestly hopes that the Japanese authorities will make progress in ending the "China Incident" so that Japan can freely cope with the various problems that have arisen in the war. At the same time, the Chongqing National Government continues to allocate funds to the Nanjing organization. As for the rumored Sino-Japanese negotiations and conciliation, there is no basis for it at all. Recently, someone returned here from Yu and stated that the National Government continues to implement the policy of resistance, becoming stronger as it fights, and growing stronger in terms of both economy and military affairs. Finally, Woodnead said that Japan will never launch adventurous offensives in other places, because Japan is deeply mired in large-scale military operations in China and cannot extricate itself.

The U.S. Should Stabilize the Far East Situation

Nathaniel Peffer, Professor of International Relations at Columbia University in the United States, recently contributed an article to Harper's Magazine, strongly advocating that the United States immediately take active measures to stop Japan's aggression against China. The United States should go further and implement economic sanctions against Japan. Only in this way can the escalation of the war in East Asia be eliminated. The United States has abandoned its neutrality, both ideologically and behaviorally, in the European war and has already implemented

Supplying Munitions

to Britain and France because Germany's victory in the future would be detrimental to U.S. interests. The same is true in the Far East. If Japan succeeds in controlling China, it will also be harmful to the United States. Japan currently does not dare to take advantage of the European war to plunder British and French rights and interests in China, precisely because it fears the strong attitude of the United States. When Japan has no other way, it creates a puppet organization and implements its plan to recognize the puppet organization as a "legitimate government," and then conclude a "peace treaty" with it, and then instigates the puppet organization to

Recover Concessions

and the vested interests of third countries. Therefore, the British, American, and French governments should warn Japan not to go against the tide, otherwise, they will retaliate together. Since Japan's motives for excluding foreigners' rights and interests in China are obvious, the U.S. authorities should take a pro-active stance. Moral sanctions against Japan should be expanded. If the situation requires it, raw materials for military use, such as oil, metals, machinery, and cotton, should all be

Banned from Exporting to Japan

High tariffs should also be imposed on Japanese goods imported into the United States. These measures are more than enough to prevent Japan from invading China. Over the past ten years, Japan has expanded its aggression and expanded its power in the Pacific, posing the greatest threat to the United States. At present, both Japan and the United States are working hard to strengthen their military equipment, and the situation is more tense than ever. Therefore, the United States should take active actions to stabilize the situation in the Far East, and after the British and French wars are over, unite with various countries to force Japan to stop its war of aggression and withdraw all its troops in China. At the same time, the United States should help China build the foundation of an independent country.

### First Day of Daylight Saving Time - Implemented Universally Throughout the City - All Agencies and Businesses Use the New Time - Those Whose Clocks Have Not Been Advanced Start Work Earlier

Since the Public Concession Board and the French Concession Council announced the implementation of daylight saving time, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce has notified all industries to follow suit. The foreign banks' association, the Chinese banks' association, and the money changers' guild have already implemented it starting yesterday. All receipts and payments are handled according to the new time. All markets, such as gold, foreign exchange, securities, miscellaneous grains, beans and rice, cotton cloth, yarn, and money changers, started trading according to the new time yesterday. All schools automatically started classes earlier.

Public Utilities

Yesterday was the first day of implementing daylight saving time. Various social undertakings related to public welfare uniformly advanced the clock by one hour. Streetcars, trolleybuses, and buses in the Public Concession and the French Concession all started running at 6:00 AM new time, which is 5:00 AM old time. The electric light company normally tests the lights at 4:00 PM every day, but now the test time is 3:00 PM old time. The business community has clearly been divided into two factions regarding this movement until yesterday. The progressives are all following the new time, while the conservatives have not moved the clock. Fortunately, there is also a standard clock for the new and old times in each place. Those who want to know the accurate new time in the future can look at the big clock at the racecourse, while for the old time, in addition to the big clock at the Jianghai Customs on the Bund, the clock on the wall of the General Post Office at the north end of North Sichuan Road has also not been advanced. According to Shanghai Post Office news, starting from June 3 this year, the office hours of the Management Bureau and various branches in this city will all be advanced by one hour, but fast clocks will not be issued.

Court Opening Time

Although the courts in the First and Second Special Districts did not uniformly advance the clock by one hour yesterday, because criminal cases are mostly prosecuted by the police, and the police escort the defendants to the court according to the new time. The police lawyers representing the prosecution also arrive at the court according to the new time. Therefore, the opening time of the criminal court of the court is one hour earlier than in the past according to the clock that has not been advanced. However, the opening time of the civil courts at all levels is still based on the old time, because the summonses issued in advance for each case still contain the old time, and the people who should be summoned do not all follow the new time. Presumably, this situation of uneven time will soon tend to be consistent. As the summer transfer period is approaching, the courts have always been accustomed to starting work one hour earlier every summer, which coincides with today's implementation of daylight saving time.

Curfew Time

Regarding the curfew time in the two concessions, starting last night, the curfew will be implemented according to the new time at 12:30 AM (i.e., 11:30 PM old time). The curfew at 1:30 AM the night before was still a temporary measure when the curfew was being changed, and it is no longer applicable last night.

Customs and Post Office Actually Implemented

The English "Great American Evening News" said that Shanghai has implemented daylight saving time since midnight. However, the big clock at the Jianghai Customs on the Bund and the big clock at the General Post Office on Sichuan Road have not changed the time as before, causing a one-hour difference from the general clocks and causing some confusion in the business district. According to Postmaster General Chapelin, he did not receive a notice about the daylight saving plan, so he followed the Jianghai Customs' method and did not change the time on the post office clock. However, Jianghai Customs and post office employees have already worked according to daylight saving time. According to Luo Fude, the Customs Commissioner of Jianghai Customs, he does not intend to change the time on the Customs clock at present, but all Customs employees work according to daylight saving time. It is said that the Customs clock must use daylight saving time, and the clock is currently one hour behind, and it cannot be blamed on the obstruction of the central government, because the Chinese and French courts in the two concessions of this city under the management of the Chinese government have all adopted daylight saving time today (1st). It is heard that the local naval authorities and the U.S. warships entering the port will also quickly comply with daylight saving time.

### Board of Directors of the Public Concession - Decision on Recess Period

### Japanese and Puppet Regime Threatens White Russians - Force Unanimous Anti-Communism - Plan to Reorganize Russian僑 Organizations - Those Who Do Not Join Will Have Their Passports Revoked - Original Russian僑 Committee Forced to Dissolve

According to foreign sources, the Japanese and puppet authorities have recently taken further control over the White Russian community in this city. The "puppet municipal government" has already dissolved the original White Russian僑民 Committee and replaced it with a White Russian from the Hongkou Huishan District as the leader to reorganize the "White Russian僑民 Organization." All members of the association must be anti-communist. This regulation has already been announced by the Russian-language RUSS newspaper under Japanese protection. The newspaper warned Russian僑 that "Russian侨 who do not join the association will have their passports revoked and will not be allowed to reside in Shanghai or enjoy the rights of citizens." This new organization will be established on the 15th of this month. The chairman of the former White Russian僑民 Committee, Mantozle, will be removed from office and replaced by Qiumeng Nage, a teacher at the current Russian Commercial School. Gosmin, the former leader of the Russian僑 Fascist Federation in Harbin, will work with Qiumeng Nage to preside over the matter.

Past Lessons

The Russian僑 community in this city is extremely surprised by this, because the anti-communist movement of White Russians led by the Japanese in Harbin, Tianjin, and Beiping has chilled them. In the aforementioned places, the Japanese have almost become dictators of the Russian僑 organizations. Under their tyranny, the Russian僑 have lost their freedom. The leaders of these Russian僑 organizations are mostly cowardly and useless people who, at the instigation of the Japanese, promote the Russian僑 to support Japan and oppose communism. In Tianjin, it is particularly appalling that Russian僑 sometimes disappear due to ideological differences. Shanghai has always been a free and safe area for Russian僑, but now it has suffered such a misfortune, and the Russian僑 cannot but feel deep worry.

Heavy Burden

According to the RUSS newspaper, the organization of the new Russian僑民 organization is roughly as follows: Chairman Qiumeng Nage, Secretary Yakoshin, Director of the Accounting Section Gosmin, Director of the Registration Section Pei Zidengnikov, Director of the Assistance Section Kechaikov. The association's address is at 405 Seward Road. In addition to being responsible for the association's affairs, Qiumou is also responsible for hosting the Russian僑 community's educational and cultural activities. The association stipulates that if a member fails to pay membership dues for three months, his membership will be immediately revoked. Membership dues are collected based on the member's monthly income. Those with a monthly income of more than 129 yuan must pay 0.05% per month. Those with more than 150 yuan must pay 1% per month. Those with more than 350 yuan must pay 1.5%. After that, for every increase of 100 yuan, an additional 1.5% of membership dues must be paid.

### Labor Dispute at Tram Company Branch Temporarily Resolved

Three hundred machine workers at the Tram Company's Beikaier Road branch in this city demanded a salary increase from the company. The company refused to publish the conditions proposed by the workers. Representatives from both labor and management held negotiations yesterday morning. At the same time, the workers returned to the factory to resume work. The labor dispute has been temporarily resolved.

### Police Department Stipulates Joint Mutual Defense Measures - Four or Five Households Can Jointly Install Alarm Bells - If One Household Has an Alarm, Neighboring Households Report to the Police Immediately

The Public Concession Police Department has stipulated the following joint mutual defense measures: (1) Shops and homes on the same street or in the same lane should be connected with hidden wires. It is most affordable to install four or five households together. (2) Each household must install an alarm bell and an indicator. The more pushbuttons installed, the better. There should also be one or two upstairs. (3) When any household presses the button, its bell will not ring, and the neighbor can call the police telephone number 15380 at this time and report to the nearby on-duty patrolman. Only with mutual cooperation between neighbors can good results be achieved. (4) Small group installations are inexpensive and can be inspected by Westerners every month. Larger organizations charge a little more because they require large indicators. (5) The police believe that if the general households in Shanghai can universally use this mutual assistance defense technology design, they will be able to make good use of the police station and deter bandits. However, the use of the alarm bell can only be limited to more serious cases. (6) The method of misusing the alarm bell must be avoided as much as possible. The pushbutton must be qualified if it has been approved and has some kind of protection and must be installed in a place where it will not be misused, but at the same time, it must be ensured that the pushbutton is not exposed and is easy to reach when used. (7) It has now been agreed with a certain machinery engineering merchant to prepare for immediate installation. The fee is 80 yuan per household for a group of five households, including the connecting line, with one pushbutton installed per household. In addition, if you install an additional pushbutton, you will be charged an additional 4 yuan. The monthly inspection fee is 5 yuan for five households. Reliable machinery industrial firms who want to know the details can see the samples at the Criminal Section of the Police Department at 185 Fuzhou Road and always register the merchant's name, address, and telephone number as a contractor. (8) After installing the alarm bell equipment, the machine engineer must report to the Criminal Section of the Police Department for registration. When a user requests installation, a list of merchant names that have been registered by the Criminal Section to request installation of equipment will be given at any time.

### New Method of Calculating Interest on Deposits and Overdrafts Implemented Yesterday - Abolishing the Monthly Balancing Method - Interest Calculated Based on Daily Balance

The Shanghai Banking and Money Industry Guild, after consultation, decided to adopt a new method of calculating interest on deposits and overdrafts starting from June 1st. The banks and money shops should calculate the interest on deposits and overdrafts based on the daily balance of deposits and overdrafts, according to the deposit and overdraft interest rates. A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency learned from the banking and money industries yesterday that the old habits of the two industries were to balance the gross interest on deposits and overdrafts with customers at the end of each month and then calculate the deposit and overdraft interest. If it is a deposit, it will be calculated according to the deposit interest rate. If it is an overdraft, it will be calculated according to the overdraft interest rate. The new method calculates the balance on the specified date and abolishes the monthly balancing method. For example, the deposit and overdraft interest rates announced by the guild at the end of last month were (1) 7.5 yuan for deposit interest and (2) 18 yuan for overdraft interest. After the above deposit and overdraft interest rates are implemented, it will be beneficial to the banks and money shops themselves, but it will not harm the customers, and it is said that foreign banks have already implemented this.

### Overseas Chinese Subscribe to National Construction Savings Bonds the Most - Can Be Sold Up to 75 Million by the End of the Year

Since the issuance of National Construction Savings Bonds, 20 million yuan has been sold, of which 15 million yuan was sold by the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, and 5 million yuan was sold by the Central Trust Bureau, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank of China. Overseas Chinese subscriptions are the most enthusiastic. Hong Kong and Manila alone sold more than 5 million yuan. It is expected that 75 million yuan can be sold by the end of the year. The Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau has now sent personnel to the United States and Hong Kong to promote sales.

### Tomorrow is the Anti-Smoking Memorial Day - Promoting Anti-Drug Movement

Tomorrow is the anniversary of Lin Zexu's burning of opium in Humen, Guangdong, which has been designated by the central government as Anti-Smoking Day. People from all walks of life in this city believe that since the withdrawal of the national army, the ban on smoking has been relaxed. It has reached the point where today, the number of traffickers and smokers is increasing, and the harm is unprecedented. They have decided to unanimously promote the anti-drug movement, eliminate the scourge of drugs, maintain public security, and protect national health.

### German Signal Magazine - Not Banned from Sale in the Concession - British Aviation Association Banquets French Military Commander - Allied Nationals Enthusiastically Donate to Their Motherland

The other day, a certain newspaper reported that the Public Concession Police Department banned the sale of the German magazine "Signal" (Dro Signal) in the Concession. According to a statement from the Police Department, this is not the case.

So-Called Ban Was a Misunderstanding

The English "Great American Evening News" said that there was a misunderstanding regarding the news reported the other day that a German English-language magazine called "Signal" was banned from sale by the Public Concession Police Department. It turned out that when a certain newspaper reporter went to a certain bookstore on Sichuan Road, a British police officer in uniform happened to enter the store and the shop assistant was not allowed to sell "Signal" magazine again. The reporter wrote a news item about the Police Department banning the sale of "Signal" magazine.

Another Bookstore

also said that two British policemen came to the store the other day and said that "Signal" magazine was banned from sale. After speaking, they took away two copies of the magazine. The German bookstore that is the general agent for "Signal" magazine heard that the Public Works Department had replied in a letter that the department and the Police Department knew nothing about this matter and admitted that police officers had no right to base it on the ordinary people

Political Views

to ban any publications, and the police were only investigating the bookstore in an "unofficial" capacity. However, the main German僑 in this city are quite indignant about this because "Signal" magazine, although it can be regarded as a German propaganda product, cannot be regarded as an inflammatory publication. Therefore,

German僑 side

may file a formal protest on the grounds that British police officers abuse police force and have a discriminatory attitude towards German publications, and the German僑 side believes that the provocative nature of "Signal" magazine is far less than that of certain pro-Allied publications that are allowed to be sold freely.

British Aviation Association Banquets French Commander

Sir Sassoon, Chairman of the Royal British Aviation Association, to celebrate that Major Danvy, a member of the Association, was recently awarded for his operations on the Western Front in Europe, held a luncheon at the Association's HSBC Building Clubhouse on May 31, and invited senior French naval and land forces in Shanghai and Colonel Essault, the new French Army Commander. The banquet the other day can be described as a joyous gathering of the British and French joint front. Sir Sassoon also took the opportunity to welcome Major Essault to take charge of the French military defense here. The Duke expressed the Allied forces' concerted efforts to resist the war and the increasing responsibility of the Allied forces, expressing welcome to Major Essault's participation, and expressing congratulations to Member Danvy for winning the government medal. It is said that Danvy is twenty years old and used to study at the British Church School on Jiujiang Road. After graduating, he joined the Air Force. When the war suddenly broke out, Danvy immediately joined the frontline operations. Finally, Major Hsia gave a thank you speech. The Major spoke about the difficult operations of the British and French Air Forces on the front lines.

Italian General Association Suddenly Sold

According to reliable sources, the Italian General Association at 285 Madon Road has been sold to the Shanghai Protective Animal Association in the past few days. It is generally believed that because Italy is about to join the war, it is feared that its property in the French Concession will be confiscated due to the relationship between hostile countries, hence this sudden move.

French僑 in This City Pray for Victory

The French Shanghai Daily News said that the other day (May 31) was the last day of the three-day prayer. Mass was held at 9:00 AM to pray for victory for France. Bishop Demi of Hangzhou Church presided over the ceremony. Attendees included French Ambassador and Mrs. Cossmo, Belgian Ambassador and Mrs. Gioumou, Polish Chargé d'affaires and Mrs. Rosset, Dutch Chargé d'affaires Baesfan, French Consul Oren, Italian Consul General Giorgio, Belgian Consul General and Mrs. Van Jessen, Commander of the French Garrison Colonel Essault, Captain Lupin of the "Garnier" warship, Commander of the French Army in Shanghai Adiko, and many senior officials from the French Concession Public Works Department Police Station.

German Sailors Leisurely Enjoy Themselves

Yesterday, it was widely rumored that the German "Fifth Column" held a meeting on the German ship Remis, which was moored in the Huangpu River. It has now been confirmed that this is not true. Since German ships were forced to moor in neutral ports after the outbreak of the European war, the sailors of the Remis felt idle and bored, so they challenged the German僑 rowing athletes in this city to a grand rowing competition yesterday near the mooring site of the Remis, near the Bund of the French Concession and the adjacent waters of Nanshi.

Hua Mao Hotel Cancels Band

As the European war has become increasingly intense, many Allied nationals in this city are practicing frugality and donating money to their motherland. For example, the French Veterans Association in Shanghai has been raising 500,000 francs of military bonds separately, which will be remitted to the home country after the full amount is raised. In addition, it is learned that the Hua Mao Hotel automatically canceled the band it had set up the other day to conform to the meaning of frugality.

### Six Businesses Penalized for Not Labeling Prices - Fined 15 Yuan Each

Six businesses, including a certain company on Nanjing Road, Shenli Company at 190 Edward Road, Taichang Company at 133 Tongfu Road, and Tongxing Company at 20 Carter Road, were fined 15 yuan each by the Special First Court on May 31 for failing to label prices as required by the Public Works Bureau after investigation.

### Two U.S. Gunboats Sail to Hankou - Peyshar Sails to Yanhu - Marblehead to Come to Shanghai

The Continental News reported that the U.S. gunboats Guam and Luzon sailed out of the Huangpu River yesterday (May 31) to Hankou. Rear Admiral Hether's fast ship Issapeyre also sailed out, heading to Wuhu. The only U.S. warship currently moored in Shanghai is the flagship of the Asian Fleet, the Augusta. According to unconfirmed news, the U.S. warship Marblehead, which is moored in Manila, is expected to arrive in Shanghai soon. However, the local naval authorities said they were not aware of the ship's arrival date.

### The Adjustment Association Plans to Temporarily Suspend Rice Purchases and Handle Clearance Procedures

The Municipal Food Adjustment Association, entrusted by various sectors, has ordered over 50,000 bags of foreign rice from the British company Jardine Matheson, totaling 19 batches as of recently. According to a visit by a reporter from the Pingming News Agency, although most of the past 19 batches of foreign rice have been cleared gradually, there are quite a few cases where the clearance procedures have been delayed. As a result, each time a new batch of foreign rice arrives, the previous batch has not been completely cleared. Therefore, the association now plans to temporarily suspend ordering after the 19th batch and resume ordering after all 19 batches have been cleared.

### Soybean Curd Workers' Strike

The movement by soybean curd shop workers in the city to increase wages began the night before last. Workers in shops in areas such as Old Zha Gate Bridge, Chenjia Bang, and Xinzha Road in the Public Concession stopped working. This extended to areas such as Eight Immortals Bridge, Taiping Bridge, and Vegetable Market Street in the French Concession. After the workers went on strike, the employers held a meeting to discuss the matter, and the result was that the workers' monthly wages were generally increased by $1.50, with the average monthly wage being $10.50, and some earning $12 per month. Currently, the labor side has proposed a wage increase of $7.50 per person, bringing the total to $18 including the original wage of $10.50. It is said that there is a large gap between the opinions of labor and management, and a solution has not yet been found. It is reported that there are over 500 soybean curd shops in the city, and employers in the Xujiahui area have already automatically increased wages, and the workers are still working as usual.

### Portugal's National Day Celebration - Portuguese Community Celebrates Today

### Wenzhou Port Blockaded - Third-Country Ships Prohibited Indefinitely - Japanese Forces Used Force to Prevent Foreign Ships from Entering

The Continental News reports: Yesterday (31st), it was learned that Wenzhou, a free port in China, has been closed by the Japanese naval authorities, and third-country ships are prohibited from entering indefinitely. Ships sailing along the coast first learned of this on May 22nd.

Opening Fire to Obstruct Navigation

On that day, the ship Argonaut attempted to enter Wenzhou, and an armed Japanese motorboat opened fire, with bullets flying over the ship's bow. Then, a Japanese officer boarded the ship and ordered it to anchor outside the port. It is reported that a British small boat attempted to pass through the Japanese blockade at night with its lights off and ran aground on a mudflat at the same time.

Changing Course to Other Places

Currently, ships sailing to Wenzhou are changing course to other places, as Japanese naval patrol boats control the area more effectively than controlling Wenzhou itself. It is customary for third-country ships sailing to Wenzhou to anchor outside the port during the day and pass through the blockade line at night.

Intimidation Tactics

Several weeks ago, the spokesperson for the Japanese Navy in Shanghai warned third-country ships that violations of port regulations had been repeatedly reported, such as ignoring Japanese Navy signals and entering the port at night with lights off. If anyone violates the rules in the future, they will suffer the serious consequences themselves.

### Nanshi Suspends Issuance of "Residence Permits" - Resumes Using Travel Permits

The "Special District Office" established by the puppet "Municipal Government" at the old site of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce originally only handled the issuance of travel permits. However, if those who obtained permits wanted to get them on the same day, they had to spend a tip ranging from one to three yuan per permit. If they did not pay, the "staff" in charge would make things difficult for them, and it would take at least three days to obtain the permit. Although the puppet "Mayor" issued a "proclamation" at the beginning of spring canceling the service fee for obtaining permits, it was only a change from "official collection" to private extortion. When the Japanese opened Nanshi, many people who could not afford the expensive rent in the concessions moved to live there because they heard that the rent in the city was low. The "Office" set up another counter to issue "Residence Permits." The validity period of this permit was longer than that of the travel permit, and there was no fee required when receiving it. Occasionally, it could also be used as a travel permit. Therefore, in recent months, the number of requests for "Residence Permits" has increased sharply, and the sales of travel permits have decreased sharply. The income of the "staff" managing the issuance of travel permits was greatly affected, and the undercurrent between them gradually intensified. However, those in charge of travel permits had a deeper relationship with the puppet "Government." Although the other party also tried their best to lobby, the result seemed to be a failure. The part that issued residence permits has now been "ordered" to end. It is not yet known whether the residence permits in Nanshi will continue to be issued or whether another "agency" will handle them. Now, in order to show "integrity and public service," the issuing of travel permits no longer accepts tips. However, it does not guarantee "same-day pickup," and those who obtain permits must personally bring various proof documents to the "application" office. It will take three days for them to be issued. Therefore, the business of those who specialize in obtaining travel permits will be slightly affected.

### Ningbo Plans to Increase Freight Charges by 50% - Ningbo People in Shanghai Object - Propose Raising More Donations to Advance 500,000 Yuan - 18,000 Bags Already Ordered to Be Shipped to Ningbo by Steamer

Yu Qiaqing's letter from Zhou Dalie, Chairman of the Ningbo Chamber of Commerce, states that the food shortage in Ningbo has reached a serious stage. If no measures are taken to provide relief, the future is worrying. However, the prices of Shanghai rice and foreign rice are very high, and it is proposed to subsidize 20 to 30 yuan per stone. Moreover, it will take three months before the new grain comes on the market. The subsidy, calculated for the four counties of Yin, Ci, Zhen, and Feng, amounts to a huge sum of 2.5 million yuan. Although the funds raised in Ningbo after all efforts were only over 300,000 yuan, it is a drop in the bucket and will not solve the problem. Therefore, it is proposed to increase the freight charges for Shanghai-Ningbo ships to and from by 50% to compensate for this. This is a last resort, and it is also intended to take from the people and use for the people. You believe that increasing the burden on merchants is not appropriate, but Ningbo's financial resources are limited. The number of donations raised before has been exhausted, and it is impossible to raise more. If the freight charges are not increased, there is no other way. However, the food problem is so serious that it is impossible to stop it. After much deliberation, what is the best way to deal with it so that the food problem can be properly resolved? You are a veteran of the country and have a strong connection to your hometown. I hope you can provide guidance so that we can follow it. Yu replied in a letter stating that after the Ningbo Food Relief Association discussed and announced a method of drawing 5% of the value of all import and export goods, the Ningbo people in Shanghai who returned to their hometowns believed that this method of drawing profit was not appropriate and unanimously expressed their opposition. Now, it is proposed to change the name and increase the import and export freight charges by 50%. Although the name has been changed, the burden on the people is still the same. This strategy is being used when there is no way to raise funds, but there are many drawbacks. The fellow villagers' association has repeatedly discussed it and unanimously agreed that the fellow villagers in Shanghai should try to raise donations, divided into two steps. The first step is to raise 1 million yuan, with Ningbo and Shanghai each bearing half. The second step is to raise another 1 million yuan. Since Ningbo is in difficulty, Shanghai is willing to bear more of the responsibility. In any case, they do not want to increase the burden on the people in order to stabilize grain prices. Because the people cannot make a living, stabilizing grain prices is done to provide relief. The burden of taxes and fees is still on the common people, and the impact is widespread throughout the entire country. Therefore, it was decided not to express support. As for the fact that Ningbo only raised 300,000 yuan, in my opinion, it seems that the amount can be increased. It is not yet exhausted, because many people have made a fortune during this period of national crisis. It is okay to contribute from the conscience. Currently, the reason why the price of rice in Shanghai has risen is that there are one or two hundred thousand bags of newly arrived rice that have not yet been reported to customs. Rice merchants are hoarding and raising prices. Therefore, the price of re-exportable rice has been shouted up to 62-3 yuan per bag, while the price of rice in this street is only 55 yuan per bag, and there are few buyers. This is because Shanghai-Ningbo ships are restricted from loading rice for direct import. Each shipping company is rushing to handle more than 10,000 bags of re-export rice, regardless of the price, thus raising the price. I had to purchase it from Hong Kong, and the price was 3-4 yuan cheaper per bag than in Saigon. I first handled 20,000 bags to be transported to Ningbo, and I urgently raised cash to purchase Hong Kong dollars. Originally, I planned to load all 1 million yuan of the funds approved by the Ministry of Finance under the name of the Sanbei Stabilization Association in Shanghai. Unexpectedly, only 500,000 yuan was used for the flat rice project loaded on the Moufu ship, and the rest was used for other purposes. I asked my brother to advance the money. If there is extra money, it is okay, but because my brother has already advanced 1.5 million yuan under the name of the Sanbei Stabilization Association, all of which is borrowed from private property, I really have no ability to borrow more. Secondly, the arbitrage in the Shanghai market is more than 4%, and the discount for remittances is 120-30 yuan. With such high interest rates, who is willing to borrow? Because the Ningbo remittance is huge and the rice payment is urgent, I am afraid that you have no cash to load. I am willing to lend you 500,000 yuan from the Sanbei rice payment stored in the Bank of China in Ningbo to load in Shanghai. Later, I received a telegram from my brother Dalie saying that 400,000 yuan had been used to repay the previous rice payment. It was found that the rice loaded by the ships was not for relief, but because Ningbo restricted ships from entering with rice, we stopped sailing. With this restriction, the shipping companies are rushing to handle it for business purposes. Although the money must be repaid, it is okay to delay it slightly. After the event, I heard that the Moufu ship had 1,000 bags that had not been loaded, but the payment had already been received. If this is true, it is even more shocking. Now, in the midst of helplessness, Shanghai has raised more than 500,000 yuan, plus 500,000 yuan from Ningbo, to first handle 18,000 bags, which will soon be loaded on the Glen ship and sent directly from Hong Kong to Ningbo for preliminary relief. Subsequent processing must be done with cash on hand, and donations cannot be collected all at once, so there is only one way to borrow and advance. In addition, the opinions of the gentlemen from the Shanghai Fellow Villagers' Association are to first handle 50,000 bags, totaling more than 60,000 stones, and prepare to lose 20 yuan per bag, totaling 1 million yuan. The second step is to handle another 50,000 bags and raise another 1 million yuan, for a total loss of 2 million yuan, which is enough for relief. As for the price, it is proposed to be 30 yuan per stone, that is, 5 pounds of rice per yuan, which will be announced accordingly.

### Before the Heat of Summer Has Arrived - Cholera Discovered - Two Patients - One Has Died

True cholera has occurred in Shanghai and has been confirmed by the Health Department. The health of all residents of Shanghai has been seriously threatened. A reporter from Datong News Agency has recorded the following information:

True Cholera Discovered in Shanghai

According to a reporter from Datong News Agency, true cholera has not been prevalent in Shanghai for many years. This disease spreads extremely quickly and is absolutely valued by the medical community in all countries. This year, it has broken out in Shanghai when the weather is not very hot, which is enough to cause anxiety.

Two Infected - Name Investigation

The place where this disease was discovered is the Shanghai Epidemic Hospital on Yuqiaqing Road. Two people have been infected with this serious infectious disease. Their names are as follows: (1) Pan Xu, from Shaoxing, 41 years old, residing at 41 Tianxiang Lane, Du Shenfu Road, French Concession. (2) Ma Zhang, from Shaoxing, 32 years old, residing at 35 Qiyu Lane, Minti Niyin Road, French Concession.

One Died - One Saved

The former of the two listed above was admitted to the hospital on the 24th of last month, and the latter was admitted to the hospital on the 28th. The director of the hospital, Deng Qingshan, sent the feces of the two to the Health Department of the Public Works Department for examination and confirmation, which was confirmed to be true cholera. Of the two, the former has died, and the latter is being treated by the hospital. The progress is still good.

### Selling Red Pills - Two Offenders Each Sentenced to Twelve Years

Huang Yufu, a Chinese detective from the Yulin Road Police Station, learned that someone was secretly transporting red pill drugs inside the house at 17, Lane 390, Qiwupu Road. He, together with Western detective Hui Tuo, went to arrest Jin Shifu, a man from Haimen, at around 11:00 PM the night before last. 23 bags of red pills were seized, each bag containing 1,000 pills, totaling 23,000 pills, all produced by Longma Foreign Company. According to Jin's confession, this batch of red pills was sent by a Chinese and two Japanese and transferred to Wang Zhangzhang, a man from Haimen. Wang was about to arrive, etc. Chinese and Western detectives waited in the room. After a while, Wang did arrive and was arrested together. In the police car, Wang wanted to bribe the Chinese detective with 200 yuan. They were taken to the police station and detained. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Zhang Dayin, a lawyer from the police station, prosecuted them in accordance with the anti-drug regulations. After questioning the defendants, their confessions were evasive. After questioning by Judge Xiao Peishen, Jin Shifu and Wang Zhangzhang were sentenced to twelve years of imprisonment and ten years of deprivation of civil rights for jointly intending to sell and possess poisonous substances. The drugs were confiscated.

### Jinglun Silk Weaving Factory - Receives Threatening Letter - Attached with a Hand Grenade

The Jinglun Silk Weaving Factory at 15, Lane 1, Xiaoshadu Road, Singapore Road, West Shanghai, whose distribution office is located at 16, Lane 520, Ningbo Road, suddenly had someone bring a letter to the factory at around 12:00 PM the night before last, with a hand grenade attached. The factory workers planned to question the person, but the person had already left quickly. The contents of the letter were threatening words. It was reported to the police station for the record.

### Tenants in Xicheng Lane, French Concession - Oppose Rent Increase - Have Sent Representatives to Negotiate Withdrawal

The houses in Xicheng Lane, Malong Road, French Concession, are the property of Sun Chuanfang, the former commander-in-chief of the Five Provinces Allied Forces. The family members of Sun entrusted the Trust Department of the Shanghai Continental Bank to collect the rent. In May of this year, the tenants in the lane received a notice from the management department stating that rents had been increased everywhere recently, but this lane would remain the same. Due to the increase in land tax, water, and electricity, rents would be increased by 30% across the board from July 1st based on the original rent amount. After receiving the notice, the tenants were all anxious. They thought that the rent in the lane was already relatively expensive, and the tap water was a self-flowing well system, and the water quality was turbid and unsanitary. Now, instead of improving it, they had to increase the rent, which was really difficult to bear. They specially convened a meeting of all tenants last night to discuss countermeasures. The following was resolved: (1) Unanimously oppose the rent increase. (2) Elect Yao Xing, Xu Menglin, Tang Zuxiang, Shen You, and eleven others as representatives to send a letter to the owner to negotiate a withdrawal. (3) The rent from July will still be paid according to the original amount. If the owner refuses to accept it, it will be deposited in the bank for safekeeping.

### Driver's Negligence Causes Death - Appeals Against Original Judgment

Peng Chaohua, a man from Yancheng, 35 years old this year, works as a driver for Pelli Ai (transliteration), a French tram company boss. At 12:20 PM on April 9th, he was driving his owner's private car No. 2700 through the intersection of Luban Road and Ximen Road. The driver was careless and knocked down Zhou Zuomin, a 12-year-old local primary school student at Fuchun Primary School (residing at 24 Xinmin Village, Malong Road, the only son of Zhou Esheng, the current accounting director of the Jiangxi Dayu China Resources Committee, and the heir of three families). He was crushed in the head and died. The police station arrested Peng and sent him to the Second Special Court, where he was prosecuted for negligent homicide in the course of business. Zhou Zhou, the victim's mother, also hired a lawyer to file an incidental civil suit, seeking damages of 17,280 yuan, which was calculated based on the goal of cultivating the deceased to study until graduation from university and find a livelihood. At the first trial, Judge Miao Qingbang ruled that the parts of the car driven by the defendant were damaged and had been verified by the Vehicle Inspection Office of the Public Works Department. He should bear the corresponding responsibility. He therefore sentenced Peng Chaohua to one year of imprisonment for causing death due to business negligence, and the incidental civil suit was transferred to the civil court for trial. Because Peng Chaohua did not accept the judgment, he hired lawyers Ba He (transliteration) and Huang Mingmin to present reasons and appeal to the Third Branch of the High Court. Yesterday afternoon, the collegial panel of the Third Branch of the High Court tried the case. The appellant made a statement in the detention center, stating the reasons for the appeal and the circumstances of the accident. The lawyer representing the incidental civil suit also appeared in court to state his opinions and reasons for claiming damages. The court ordered the hearing to be adjourned to a later date, and the appellant was still remanded to custody.

### Affected by the European War - Commodity Prices in Shanghai Gradually Stabilize

Recently, commodity prices in Shanghai have gradually stabilized due to the European War. However, many of the commodity prices in various industries that have risen several times in the past still maintain their highest prices. The New New Company on Nanjing Road has always been known for its unique low profit. When commodity prices in various industries in Shanghai rose, the company set prices lower than the general market price in order to reduce the burden on customers. The recent summer special price campaign has made even more significant progress. This has left a very good impression on the community. The abnormal prosperity of Shanghai has reached its peak. At this time of high-pressure and difficult life for citizens, it is hoped that the business community will automatically correct the level of suppressing commodity prices.

### Grains: Rice Merchants Stir Up Trouble Again, Fabricating Various Stories to Deceive People, Aiming to Profit by Exploitation

Shanghai rice merchants are once again exploiting the situation, taking advantage of the rice shortage in eastern Zhejiang to stir up unrest in Shanghai, manipulate Shanghai's rice prices, acting with a malice more venomous than snakes. The rumors they spread include: (1) Claims of a shortage of imported rice, stating that assigned quotas are low and Shanghai's reserves are not abundant, only about 700,000 bags. These figures come from the rice merchants and can be inflated or deflated at will, rendering them unreliable. Regarding rice reserves, the concession authorities refuse to take responsibility for conducting on-site investigations, simply relying on the merchants' reports, which is a significant oversight. As for whether imports will continue, it is not public information, so how can anyone know the truth? Merchants wanting prices to fall can say large shipments are arriving; merchants wanting prices to rise can say no shipments are scheduled. Everything comes from the mouths of the rice merchants; how can it be trusted? (2) Fabricating claims of drought preventing rice planting. This is even more reprehensible. The plum rain season is still after the Dragon Boat Festival, and the Grain in Ear solar term has not yet arrived. How can they know there will be no plum rains? Even if there are no plum rains, the impact will be minor, mainly affecting higher-altitude areas in Zhejiang Province. Major rice-producing areas usually have a network of rivers and canals. Even without rain, it would only require more labor; it would not prevent rice planting. Therefore, these pretexts are concocted because rice merchants fear rice prices will not be high enough, and they fear lacking excuses to manipulate the market, in order to stir up public anxiety and forcibly raise rice prices. The concession authorities should not continue to allow these unscrupulous merchants to harm the people's food supply. Furthermore, the rice panic in Hangzhou, Shaoxing, Ningbo, and other areas in Zhejiang Province is prompting daily procurement and relief efforts. The Chaoshan and Xiamen merchants from Guangdong, as well as the Nanxun, Jiaxing, and Huzhou areas along the Sujia Road, are successively increasing their purchases, drastically expanding the sales channels, causing all types of rice prices to rise higher and higher.

Yesterday, imported rice became even more popular. Merchants from Hangzhou, Shaoxing, and other inland areas continued to purchase without hesitation. Ningbo merchants also made purchases. Due to insufficient supply of domestic rice, demand was strong, compounded by speculation from both industry insiders and outsiders, and the merchants hoarding goods to drive up prices, the market saw prices soar. Small polished rice rose from 49.78 yuan to 50.056 yuan in the morning and then surged to 51.3 yuan in the afternoon. No. 2 Saigon and Fire Grain both soared to 52 yuan, and No. 1 New Saigon also surged to 53 yuan, rising about one yuan in the morning compared to the previous market and continuing to rise 56 jiao in the afternoon. Small polished rice in original packaging also surged to 61 yuan. No. 2 Siam rice was priced at 61 yuan but lacked buyers. New orders were being negotiated at around 57 yuan, and it is rumored that some deals have been finalized. However, due to concerns about the safety of ships, both rice merchants and foreign firms are taking a wait-and-see attitude.

Domestic rice, including thick and thin Japonica rice, are also in the same situation. Rumors of off-market deals are spreading, all for actual sales, with prices rising across the board. Changbang Qing Te Geng (Special Japonica rice) was trading at 56-57 yuan, Fen Geng (Powder Japonica rice) at 54 yuan, Changkun Geng Te (Special Changkun Japonica rice) from 54 yuan, and the next grade at 52-53 yuan. Qingsi Te Bo (Special Thin Qingsi rice) was 55-56 yuan, Da Shi (Big Market) at 53-54 yuan, and the next grade at 51-52 yuan. Nangang early rice was 51-52 yuan, and the price per dan was 50 yuan.

Although the arrival of glutinous rice is also limited, the sales market is not as broad as other grains, causing prices to rise only half a yuan to nearly a yuan, following Japonica and Tip rice. Jinli Special Yuan was selling for 46 yuan, Changdan Bai Yuan (White Yuan from Changzhou and Danyang) was 44-45 yuan, and the next grade was 42-43 yuan. Jiangbei Bai Yuan (White Yuan from Jiangbei), which had previously been sold at lower prices and has a firmer texture, is quite popular inland, resulting in brisk sales. Therefore, the selling price increased by more than one yuan, opening at 42.5 to 42 yuan.

### Flour Merchants Begin Manipulating the Market Again

Yesterday's flour market was not very active, and the market felt tight. Recently, merchants from both northern and southern provinces have shown signs of activity. Inland areas such as Zhejiang and Ningbo are also experiencing rice shortages, so flour sales are not weak. Therefore, factories have been quietly raising prices for customers, with rumors of prices as high as 13.6 yuan, but not on the open market. As for the wholesale price of No. 2 flour on the street, it remained at the original price of 13.8 yuan, but it is feared that it will also increase soon. Inland flour, such as Shunfeng brand, also rose to 13.89 yuan. As rice prices have been rising for several days, commodity prices are also expected to rise. It was found that 100 bags of Gang flour were shipped to Shantou today.

### Finance: Foreign Exchange Continues to Tighten

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no changes in HSBC's listed rates. The unofficial markets for British and American exchange continued to soften. This was because the demand from foreign banks increased sharply, leading to a shortage of funds. In the past two days, speculators have not been buying heavily, but they have not been selling either. In the early morning, the exchange rate suddenly rebounded, leading to a flat British rate and a softer American rate. Subsequently, British banks aggressively absorbed shillings and American dollars, reportedly purchased on behalf of the Exchange Equalization Committee. Then, American banks followed suit, further tightening prices. The American exchange rate reached 5.375 yuan, and the British exchange rate reached 4 pence 0.3125. Around 10:30, foreign banks were both buying and selling, keeping supply and demand relatively balanced, and the trend stabilized. Before the close, there was a slight rebound. As a result, the British exchange rate was 4 pence 0.46875, and the American exchange rate was 5.4375 yuan, both tighter by 0.09375 compared to the previous day. Futures contracts tightened only slightly, aligning with the spot market.

Foreign Banks Eager to Buy

In the early morning, London telegraphic transfer rates for both near and far terms fell by 1.875, New York silver prices fell slightly, and London gold remained stable. Exchange rates for British against American, Shanghai, French, and other currencies were flat. American against British increased by 0.375, against Shanghai by 0.05, and against Shanghai by 0.01875. The Central Bank's listed rates remained the same. In the morning, banks opened spot selling rates with British exchange at 4 pence 1.40625 and American exchange at 5.5625 yuan, which was flat for British and tighter by 0.03125 for American compared to the previous evening's close. This was due to the sudden rebound in the exchange rate. After the opening, British banks were eager to buy, causing prices to soften slightly. It was estimated that foreign banks bought shillings at 4 pence 1.125 and also bought American dollars from American banks at a price of 5.5 yuan to 4.4375 yuan. It was rumored that the above positions were purchased on behalf of the Exchange Equalization Fund Committee. HSBC's listed rates were announced and remained unchanged. The silver balancing tax was announced, reducing it by 0.01%. Later, Chase also came to absorb, and at that time, foreign banks had very little intention to supply. Chinese banks had sold shillings to Chase, tightening the rate to 4 pence 0.3125. The American exchange rate also softened to 5.375 yuan. After 11:00, although Olyphant and others were buying, Sassoon, the Japanese Bank, and others were selling, keeping the market stable. June shilling contracts were traded with American banks buying from Sassoon at 3 pence 8.6875, and June American exchange was sold by Zhengjin to Olyphant and Jardine Matheson at 5.28125 yuan. Transactions cleared up slightly before the noon close. Only speculators saw the price return to a low level and bought June American dollars at 5.5 yuan from Chinese banks. The closing results were British exchange at 4 pence 0.46875, American exchange at 5.4375 yuan, June British exchange at 3 pence 9.6875, and June American exchange at 5.28125 yuan. Compared to yesterday's closing price, spot British and American exchange both tightened by 0.09375, June contracts tightened by 0.03125, and American exchange softened by 0.015625. There was no afternoon market on Saturday.

Hong Kong: American Exchange Soft, British Exchange Unchanged

Hong Kong, 1st (Saturday) Dispatch: The exchange market opened flat this morning. Both British and Shanghai exchange rates were unchanged. Spot American exchange softened by 0.1875, to 20.125 yuan.

### Interest on Funds Transferred Via Draft in May: 7.5 Yuan per 1000 Yuan

The Shanghai Banking Industry Joint Reserve Committee has set the interest rate for interbank funds transferred via draft in May at 7.5 yuan per 1000 yuan (equivalent to a monthly interest rate of 7.5%).

### Gold Price Exceeds 6000 Yuan

Yesterday, the unofficial market for cash "cooked gold" (smelted gold) rose sharply, exceeding the 6000 yuan mark again. The reasons for the firm high prices are the increase in demand and the addition of leverage by large investors, as well as the slow softening of foreign exchange, which made people apprehensive. The bullish sentiment was not influenced by current domestic or international news. Trading was quite active in the first half of the day. The opening price was 5930 yuan, a decrease of 20 yuan compared to the previous day. Later, it was heard that money exchangers were aggressively buying, and the price soon rose to 5980 yuan. At that time, the foreign exchange rate was also reported tight, and a certain gold firm intermittently sold, in large quantities, slightly suppressing the upward trend. It had fallen back to 5955 yuan. As the exchange market softened, securities firms made large profits, and gold firms also came back to buy, creating a large buying frenzy. The highest price broke the 6000 yuan mark, reaching a high of 6070 yuan. However, as foreign exchange rebounded slightly before noon, and retail investors and banks offered their profits, it fell back to 6010 yuan. The closing result was 6025 yuan, an increase of 75 yuan compared to the previous evening's close. The number of transactions in half a day was two thousand taels. Jewelry gold was raised by ten yuan, while customs gold remained flat.

Cooked Gold Rises by 75 Yuan

Since the morning, the mood was slightly fatigued, down a small 20 yuan per bar (10 taels). Jewelry shops sold to banks at 5930 yuan. Later, money exchangers and securities firms mutually absorbed, immediately pulling up 50 yuan, with banks mutually transacting at 5980 yuan. Then, a certain gold firm forcefully sold more than 200 taels, and a certain jewelry shop followed suit, plummeting 25 yuan. A gold firm bought 20 taels from banks, and securities firms bought 30 taels from jewelry shops, all at 5955 yuan. At that time, a certain jewelry shop, on behalf of its guild, bought more than 100 taels at a limit price of 6000 yuan, and the market sentiment was firm and stable. Soon after, the foreign exchange market softened, buying intensified, gold firms, securities firms, banks, and retail investors competed to buy aggressively. Retail investors also followed, and for a time, the situation was extremely brisk. Before long, it jumped more than 100 yuan, with banks buying 90 taels from their peers at 6070 yuan. After that, the exchange market rebounded, the number of buyers gradually decreased, and a certain money exchanger returned to offer, retail investors also exited to take profits, falling back to 6000 yuan. Banks did 30 taels at 6010 yuan. At noon, banks came to buy again, raising it another 15 yuan, with banks buying 20 taels from gold firms at 6025 yuan, as the noon closing price. As a result, it was 75 yuan higher than the previous day. There was a fluctuation of 140 yuan in half a day. The selling price of the current brand gold of cash gold firms is ten-odd yuan higher than cooked gold, and the buying price is 30 yuan lower. The current bid gold is fifty-odd yuan lower than the listed gold, and there is little trading.

Jewelry Gold Up 10 Yuan

The initial selling price of jewelry gold per tael was still 610 yuan by the Datong Association. At 10:30, it was raised by 10 yuan. After that, there was no change. As a result, the Datong Association changed the price to 620 yuan. The new association has the same price as the previous one, and the buying price is reduced by about 25 yuan.

### Foreign Currencies Continue to Rise

Yesterday, the market for foreign currencies saw "cooked gold" continuing to rise under the purchases by Hong Kong firms. British gold pounds followed suit and continued to rise. Due to the Equalization Committee dumping foreign exchange in the black market, there was a strong demand for British and American gold notes. American notes had been as high as 18.45 yuan but ended at 18.28 yuan, still up 0.23 yuan from yesterday. British gold notes were also up 0.15 yuan. Hong Kong notes rose with the trend of Shanghai-Hong Kong exchange rates. French notes had a slight demand, and the market price rose slightly. Canadian and Philippine notes also had demand, and the market prices rose across the board. The supply of Japanese gold notes remained strong, retreating to 1.13 yuan in the evening market. Korean notes had balanced supply and demand, remaining at 0.96 yuan in the evening market.

### Discount Rate Returns to 5 Yuan

Yesterday, the discount rate for fund transfer notes decreased again. The initial discount rate was 123 yuan per 1000 yuan for buying and 128 yuan for selling. The lowest discount was 120 yuan. At noon, it was around 122 yuan. In the afternoon, it was flat, down 5 yuan compared to the previous day. The interest rate for money exchangers was quoted at 0.25 yuan in both the morning and afternoon markets.

### Securities: New Buyers of Domestic Debt Gradually Show Interest, Foreign Debt Weakens Again

Yesterday's unofficial securities market continued to strengthen, but trading was still very quiet in the morning. In the afternoon, there were slight new buyers transactions. The prospects for the money market were generally considered to be gradually loosening, so bullish investors still had some interest in buying even on Saturday afternoon. The news remained dull, but international changes were not far off. Both buyers and sellers were waiting for future developments to determine their direction. Yesterday's trading volume was less than 100,000 yuan in the morning. In the afternoon, due to slight demand from Xie Da, Xin Chang, Wu Yuan, and other firms, and limited supply from Yi Tai, Hong Da, and Yi Chang, the market strengthened again. Type W reached 50 yuan. As a result, market prices continued to improve by 0.05 to 0.15 yuan. The total transaction volume was over 300,000 yuan. A summary table is listed below:

Stock transactions included 50 shares of Huacheng Tobacco Public Co. stock at a price of 43 yuan.

### Yarn and Cotton: Exchange Rate Tightens, Cotton Yarn Buying Resumes

The yarn market is stable, with a slight upward trend. This is because the end of the month has passed, and operators have more financial flexibility. At the same time, the exchange rate has tightened, boosting confidence, so the market has shown a significant recovery. However, actual transactions have not fully developed.

The opening price of spot yarn this morning was high due to the rise in gold in the afternoon of the previous day, and market sentiment was tight. However, there were very few new buyers. The opening price for 20-count Double Horse was 1310 yuan, falling to 1285 yuan. It was later heard that the exchange rate tightened again, and buying resumed, reaching 1330 yuan. The closing price fell back slightly by 10 yuan. The statistics for transactions in half a day showed 1540 bales. The price of 20-count Double Horse increased by 30 yuan. Today, 605 bales of yarn were shipped to Hong Kong. The quantities purchased by each group are listed below:

Hong Kong: 330 bales Fuzhou: 40 bales

Same Trade: 1,160 bales Xiamen: 10 bales

Total: 1,540 bales

### Manufacturers Wait and See, Cotton Market Stagnant

Trading in raw cotton remains lackluster, but there are occasional sales among traders. As for manufacturers, Japanese mills have shown no activity, so there is not much buying or selling on the market. The situation remains deadlocked. The current transactions for raw cotton are listed below:

Da Zhong Ji: 243.00 yuan Bought by traders: 100 bales

Kang Jiang Hua: 204.00 yuan Bought by traders: 100 bales

Du Li La: 207.00 yuan Bought by traders: 200 bales

News from the foreign cotton market: The New York cotton market opened smoothly in the morning. Later, due to selling pressure, cotton prices declined. Then, due to good weather forecasts in the western cotton regions and the selling of near-term contracts by some spot traders, the market weakened. As a result, closing prices were down 20 points for near-term contracts and down more than 10 points for distant contracts. The Indian market was quiet, with forecasts of a rise of one rupee.

Transactions in foreign cotton in Shanghai were very quiet. All parties are temporarily taking a wait-and-see attitude, and the market is quite stagnant. However, there is not much spot available in the market, so selling prices are initially very firm. Tianjin merchants' interest has gradually increased, and there will be a turning point for raw cotton in the coming days. The following are the futures prices converted to delivered-to-factory prices at an exchange rate of 5.5 yuan for American dollars:

20-count: American Middling: 302.90 yuan

Also: Lower Grade: 294.00 yuan

32-count: American Middling: 321.80 yuan

Also: Lower Grade: 312.00 yuan

42-count: American Middling: 325.50 yuan

Also: Lower Grade: 314.50 yuan

### Miscellaneous Grains: New Broad Beans Down 0.5 Yuan, Japanese Oil Mills Buy Soybeans

Yesterday's market for new green broad beans from Minhang was traded outside the official market, so it is not considered the official market price. It was heard that there were only thirty-odd bags, priced at 19 yuan, down 0.5 yuan from the previous price. The official market price is not as low as this. For soybeans, in addition to a small number being bought by traders on this street, the remaining three-quarters were bought by Japanese oil mills. Because soybean cake has a lively sales market and prices are heading for a peak, the market has a squeezed situation, so the sales of soybeans have expanded further. However, supply cannot meet demand, and the overall trend is upward. Yesterday, a carload of Bengbu soybeans opened at 24.5 yuan, a carload of Chuzhou soybeans at 23 yuan, more than 400 bags of Anqing soybeans at 24.5-24 yuan, more than 200 bags of Wuhu soybeans at 23.2-23 yuan, a carload of Mingguang soybeans at 24.2 yuan, as well as 100 bags of Pinghu mottled beans, more than 40 bags of Taicang black beans, 300 bags of Chongming yellow beans, and more than 700 bags of Jiangbei green beans.

### Oilseed Cakes: Japanese Controlled New Rapeseed, Soybean Oil Up Another 3 Yuan, Soybean Cake Price Surge Still Fierce

Soybean Oil: Recently, due to Japanese merchants controlling and buying new rapeseed from inland areas, soybean oil is cheaper than rapeseed oil, so it has attracted purchases from all parties. The general manipulation has gained an opportunity to monopolize, and prices have frequently risen. Yesterday, under good conditions, the market jumped up another 3 yuan. It is estimated that more than 400 barrels and more than 300 baskets of various oils were transacted. Also, 80 pieces of raw oil were shipped to Shantou today.

Soybean Cake: The price surge is fierce. In addition to Dayouyu Factory maintaining its position and not opening, other factories operated by Japanese merchants are still selling. It is estimated that oil and other traders bought 3,000 pieces of Xingji cake from the Pudong factory of the same surname, and they ordered 3,000 pieces to be delivered in June. Inland areas ordered 4,000 pieces of Kunshan Housheng Factory brand cake. Market prices are detailed in the market price column.

### Silk and Tea: Wuxi Cocoon Prices Chaotic, Cocoon Merchants Mostly Dumping and Accepting Recklessly

In Wuxi City and rural areas, the cocoon merchants are mostly controlled by the "Joint Company". The remaining Shanghai-Wuxi silk factories and small local silk factories have also opened to collect cocoons. Due to the restrictions on cocoon merchants this year, there is no freedom as in the past. Only one or two simple stoves are required to open a business, hang up a scale, and collect goods. Therefore, after the cocoon merchants opened the scales the day before yesterday, cocoon prices were extremely chaotic. The Silk Cocoon Association limited the price to 250 yuan per dan (yesterday's mistaken price of 350 yuan), but in order to compete for purchases, some merchants opened the scales with prices exceeding the limit by more than 50%. This chaotic situation, on the one hand, was caused by competitive bidding driving up prices, and on the other hand, by middlemen reselling fraudulently. Legitimate cocoon merchants are still taking a wait-and-see attitude, with purchase prices generally capped at 300 yuan. Impoverished breeders are willing to sell cheaply. Cocoon merchants also need to consider the exchange rate for the silk market. Due to the obstruction of silk sales by the European War, the future of silk cocoons is bleak. If the price exceeds 300 yuan per dan, there may be losses.

Also, 20 pieces of tea were shipped to Hong Kong today, and five bales of silk were shipped to London. Another bale was shipped to Saigon.

### Piece Goods: Stockpilers Already Have Concerns, Cloth Market Gradually Enters the Right Track

Domestic Cloth: The cloth market is stable. Because cloth prices have fallen by about one-third from the highest prices, it is quite cost-effective for merchants to purchase. However, because actual sales are still in a quiet period, and those inside and outside the industry who have been stockpiling in the past are now facing heavy losses, they are wary. Therefore, market prices do not fluctuate much and are gradually entering the right track. Yesterday's selling prices for various cloths fluctuated in the range of 0.25-0.5 yuan. Demand from the Zhejiang route was better. Wenzhou merchants continued to purchase 100-odd pieces of fine cloth, twill, coarse cloth, and colored cloth. Ningbo merchants purchased nearly 100 pieces. Guangdong merchants purchased 100-odd pieces of colored cloth and other goods. Retail sales in this street and wholesale business in inland areas have slightly improved, with transactions of 200-odd pieces of greige, colored cloth, coarse cloth, and other goods.

Eastern Cloth: Although trading is light, market prices are rising firmly. Longtou (Dragon Head) fine cloth opened this morning at 40.05 yuan per bolt, and Sijunzi (Four Gentlemen) serge at 1.085 yuan per yard. The market trend continued to improve, with Longtou fine cloth quoted at 41.5 yuan and serge around 1.1 yuan, but there were few transactions.

Exports: Today, 220 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Hong Kong, 105 pieces were shipped to Turkey, and 45 pieces were shipped to Siam.

### A Review of the Woolen Fabric Market Over the Past Month

Since the dramatic change in foreign exchange rates on the 2nd of last month, the intensity of the price surge in the woolen fabric market has been unprecedented in recent years. Although exchange rates have since softened, prices remain firm as before. This is because of the European War, making it difficult to receive shipments. Here is a detailed survey of woolen fabric market prices over the past month:

### Sugar Market: Refined White Sugar Up 2 Yuan

Yesterday's sugar market continued to rise due to the tightening of foreign exchange. The association's quoted price for spot 14 coarse white sugar, foreign warehouse goods, was 72 yuan to 71.5 yuan in the morning, then 71.8-71.9 yuan. It softened slightly in the afternoon, to 71.8-71.5 yuan, up 0.7 yuan. Transit goods initially rose by 1 yuan, to 58.5 yuan, then to 58-57.9 yuan, and 58-57.5 yuan in the afternoon, with no change. Taikoo refined white B mark rose from 82.5 yuan to 83 yuan, up 2 yuan from before. H mark red refined sugar was 59 yuan, up 1 yuan. Dutch red sugar remained at 61 yuan. Xinghua merchants offered 60 bags of Xinghua Qinggao (Green High) domestic sugar at 65 yuan, down a small 2-3 yuan from before. The rest had few transactions.

### Hardware: Native Nails Smaller and Smaller

Transactions in nails from local factories have been very stagnant recently. Foreign merchants rarely purchase, and local sales have also been quiet, resulting in a sluggish market and low morale. A recent survey of the output from factories shows no reduction, so the market is full of goods, with supply greatly exceeding demand. Therefore, standard market prices are getting smaller and smaller. It was heard that yesterday's market quote was only 70 yuan per barrel of Basei nails, but secretly, 68-69 yuan could also be sold.

### North and South Goods: Lian Yuan (桂圓, Dried Longan) Price Reportedly Increases

Recently, due to the lack of continuous arrivals of dried longan pulp from Xiamen, Tong'an and other places, the market stock is depleted, and the price has become tight. Yesterday, it was heard that a Hong Kong firm released a batch of Lianzhou dried longan pulp, with a price reaching 176 yuan. The market price has also tightened accordingly, but old stock is said to be relatively cheaper.

Shen Bao Weekly Supplement

### The First Stage of the Western Front War

Since August of last year, Hitler has repeatedly decided to revise his basic strategy. His first plan was to have another Munich, conquering Poland without a fight. This plan failed because Poland decided to fight. His second plan was to threaten Britain and France to abandon their policy of guaranteeing Poland, so that the invasion of Poland would be reduced to a local war. The conclusion of the German-Soviet agreement served this purpose. This threat did not work.

His third plan was to conquer Poland in one fell swoop, and then negotiate peace with Britain and France. This plan gave Britain and France ample time to mobilize. Once the war had begun, there was no easy way for Britain and France to make peace with Germany, otherwise, Hitler's military strength would not be damaged, and Britain and France would remobilize, which would be tantamount to military suicide.

Hitler's fourth plan was to wage war against Britain with minimal expenditure, using submarines, magnetic mines, and a few aircraft to attack British shipping. At the same time, he would strive to enrich the economic rear, wait for an opportunity to strike, and quietly wait for the decline, war-weariness, and erosion of combat strength of the democracies. Even if this was not enough to force Britain and France to stop the war, it would be enough to make them impatient and take risks.

As for the basic strategy of Britain and France, it was to intensify the blockade, forcing Hitler to choose between suffocating to death or launching a major offensive. This strategy had two major factors. First, no matter how strict the blockade, Germany must be forced to consume a large amount of its stockpiled raw materials, so that it cannot replenish them, in order to weaken its military strength. This requires intensifying operations and accelerating the rate of consumption to achieve the greatest effect. Therefore, as long as Britain and France avoid a complete defeat, they should disregard local gains and losses, forcing Germany to wage a large-scale war until its economic weaknesses become the key to victory or defeat. At that time, the blockade will become the decisive weapon.

Second, Hitler's ability to make all of Europe a world of terror lies in his strength. Britain and France must use great courage and great sacrifice to risk a battle with this strength, in order to call on the countries of Europe to get rid of their fear and unite to overthrow Hitler. Britain and France have allies everywhere. But Britain and France must pay a very high price to obtain their assistance.

Hitler has launched a general offensive on the Western Front, and in less than twenty days he has reached the English Channel. This is similar to the situation in the first phase of the last European war, the so-called "race to the sea." The tactics he used, the so-called Blitzkrieg, first used large numbers of low-flying aircraft to destroy enemy positions, replacing the artillery bombardment used in the last European war. Then, large formations of heavy tanks, covered by large formations of light tanks, concentrated on one point and launched a fierce attack. Sometimes, paratroopers were dropped simultaneously behind enemy lines, using machine guns to strafe the defending troops.

Heavy tank formations move more slowly and consume more gasoline. After the initial charge, they must fall behind. At this time, the light tank formations overtake and cover the advance as much as possible, engaging in reconnaissance work. If they encounter significant resistance, they must wait for the heavy tank formations to come forward and attack. After the light tank formations, motorized units followed, and infantry brought up the rear to occupy the positions.

During the initial charge, tank formations often maintain close contact with large air force units. Thereafter, the contact is not so close, but if the tank advance is blocked by tank defense positions, the tank formation immediately reports to the bomber units to come to help. With as many as 1,200 tanks used, the offensive is naturally unstoppable, and although the Allied forces fought bravely, they were unable to reverse the decline.

It may be said that Hitler's general offensive was not out of his own volition, but because domestic raw materials were being consumed more and more, making it difficult to get through the winter. At the same time, he feared that the strength of Britain and France would become stronger and stronger day by day. Forced by circumstances, he made a desperate gamble. But judging from the results at the current stage, although Britain and France can be said to have gained an advantage in military strategy, Hitler has gained a victory in tactics.

A Study of European War Place Names

Since the Western Front war has become tight, the advance and retreat of the various armies has been rapid, and the general public has suffered from the unevenness of the place names translated by the various news agencies. This publication will then make a study of the place names of the major and minor battlefields in Europe at any time, and publish them in succession. The content is mainly related to current events. Other geographical scholars such as population, products, and customs will be lacking. The translations used are based on the Comprehensive English-Chinese Dictionary published by the Commercial Press, for the sake of convenience only. (In fact, if the various news agencies can avoid being bothered and follow this example, the translations of place names will naturally be the same by agreement.) Editor's Note.

Flanders is the coastal area from Calais in France to the Schelde River in Belgium and the Lys River basin. The coastline is more than 40 miles long. Along the coast are ports such as Dunkirk, Ostend, and Zeebroge. The majority of the residents are the Flemish people. At the end of the last European war, that is, on September 28, 1918, the Allied forces of Britain, France, and Belgium (the Belgian army was on the left wing, the French army was in the center, and the British army was on the right wing), under the command of King Albert I of Belgium, adopted an offensive. By October 1, they had attacked eight miles into the German positions. By October 17, the last German troops withdrew from the port of Ostend. This was the "Battle of Flanders."

The Schelde River is also known as the Escaut River by the French. It originates in France, passes through Belgium and the Netherlands, and flows into the North Sea. It is the boundary line of the Flanders region. Carnbrai, Valenolennes, Tournai, Oudenarde, Ghent, and Antwerp are all important cities along the river. The river is 250 miles long.

Artois is the area around the city of Arras in northern France. It is not easy to find on the map. Before the French Revolution, it was once divided into a province. Now it is only an empty place name that people generally call. In May and June 1915, the Allied forces launched an attack on the German army from Arras in order to contain the German army and prevent them from dividing their forces to the Eastern Front to resist the Russian army. The British army made some progress, but the number of officers killed and wounded was as high as 22,923, and the number of soldiers was as high as 476,553. The advance was unsuccessful. This was the "Battle of Artois."

The Somme River is located in northern France, 147 miles long. It originates near Saint-Quentin and flows into the English Channel. The cities of Perronne, Amiens, and Abbevine along the coast have all fallen into German hands. The river is connected to the Oise River and the Schelde River by canals. During the last European war, it was the site of two major battles. The first "Battle of the Somme" began on July 1, 1916. The main force of the British army attacked the German positions in order to contain the German offensive against Verdun. On September 15, the British army first used tanks in battle, but due to the limited number, the effectiveness was not great. The fierce battle continued until November, when the continuous rain stopped the fighting. The second "Battle of the Somme" began on March 21, 1918, which was the first act of the German army's final general offensive. At that time, the German army on the Western Front had a total of 1.5 million men and 16,000 artillery pieces. The attack was very fierce. It was not until August 8 that the British army used 450 tanks to cover the main force and defeated the German army. In this battle, 21,000 German soldiers were captured, and the British army lost only 20,000 men.

Sedan is a city in France, located on the right bank of the Meuse River, 164 miles northeast of Paris. During the last European war, it was occupied by the German army until it was recovered by the American and French armies before the armistice. The city became famous during the Franco-Prussian War in 1870. At dawn on September 1 of that year, German Chief of Staff Moltke ordered a general offensive. King Napoleon III of France was no match and surrendered with 104,000 troops. The German army suffered 9,000 casualties. This was the "Battle of Sedan."

Liege is a famous city in Belgium, straddling the Meuse River, surrounded by high mountains, and with a magnificent terrain. It is located 55 miles southeast of the Belgian capital and 10 miles from the German border. For the sake of the situation, it has been used as the coal, iron, and military industry center of Belgium. Of the 56 iron factories in Belgium, the city accounts for 20 of them. On August 5, 1914, the German army launched a large-scale offensive with 100,000 troops. The surrounding forts fell one after another. The city was captured on the 16th. The German army did not withdraw until the end of the last European war.

Louvain is a cultural city in Belgium, located on the Dyle River, 19 miles northeast of the capital. The famous University of Louvain was established in 1416. In the 16th century, it had 6,000 students. In 1914, when the German army invaded, the entire city was burned down, and the university library was also destroyed, causing enormous losses. A new library was built in 1921 with books donated by the people of the United States and other countries. It was completed in 1928 and now has more than 600,000 books, including 50,000 books donated by the John Rylands Library in Manchester, England.

### Review of America's Entry into the War

— Bo Ming

The situations in 1939 and 1914 are vastly different. We have now gained twenty-five years of experience and understand the horrors of modern warfare. However, this experience also reminds us of the great battles of Saint-Mihiel and the Argonne, and the victory marches under the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. These memories bind our emotions, policies, and national interests to France more closely than in 1914. We have also understood the global changes that were unknown in 1914, and we are more aware of the extent to which America feels the impact of any major European war.

When the European war broke out last year, Americans perhaps had more timely news from Europe than others. Having witnessed the last world war, the Sino-Japanese War, and the wars in Abyssinia and Spain, the barbaric actions of Germany's invasion of Holland and Belgium did not shock us as severely as Germany's invasion of Belgium did in the last world war. Our basic attitude toward this war was not hastily decided under the shock of horror and wartime propaganda. We deeply know that this war will have direct implications for us in many ways, and that our country may eventually become a belligerent.

Today's American attitude certainly still contains the same awareness as the last time, namely that the Anglo-French Allied forces are fighting for us, or will produce a stronger pressure to prompt American intervention to prevent the defeat of Britain and France. However, the American attitude now is more self-aware and more realistic, and the necessity of intervention will naturally be considered more calmly and realistically. The indignation felt by Americans toward Germany's actions appears to be lower than in the last world war, and there is a more practical consideration of how German actions will actually affect the United States. If we passively come forward to aid Britain and France, we will more clearly know how we should act. President Roosevelt did not, like President Wilson, instruct the whole nation to be "neutral in thought". Our politicians and the public will certainly not repeat the mistake of being biased in fact while thinking that their actions are completely just and impartial.

We certainly won't underestimate the intensity and horror of modern warfare this time. The resentment of Americans caused by the torpedoing of the Athenia is just a weak ripple compared with the anger caused by the sinking of the Lusitania in the last world war. This is simply because we have already seen these tragedies in the catastrophe of the war itself, and are very clear that preventing these tragedies will cost an even greater price.

Although this war has raised many of the same issues as the last war, the background is different and the reaction is different. For example, we have acquiesced to Britain's interruption of our trade with Europe this time, but the importance of this trade to our country has greatly decreased compared with 1914.

Even if the American military industry prospers because of the war, it will not necessarily lead the United States to participate in the war. Merchants also have the experience of knowing that participating in the war will lose the great benefits of a neutral country, and often be subject to heavy wartime taxes and strict controls. Therefore, it can be asserted that if the United States participates in the war, it will definitely not be manipulated by the industrial or financial sectors. This is simply because the industrial and financial sectors are more afraid of the social and economic disruption that participation in a major war will cause than any other industry.

In short, if the United States is forced to participate in the war, there must be even more important reasons to make it do so. However, the chances of sending troops will be less than in 1914. The crux of the matter is not whether the United States will participate in the war, but under what conditions it will participate. The United States' precautionary measures to avoid being drawn into the vortex and the strength of its naval and air forces are already quite sufficient. What is unprepared is the failure to stipulate what interests are vital to the survival of the United States, and what the goals of the United States must be to participate in the war.

Regardless of who wins or loses, some kind of new international system must be established in the midst of devastation. However, what kind of system is welcomed by the United States? To what extent are we willing to do our best to promote its realization?

These are the real questions. What will be decided now may not be how the United States can stay out of it, but what wise actions the United States should take to promote a new situation and avoid repeating the mistakes of participating in the last war. (Translated from the American magazine Life)

### The Recipe of the Famous Aviator Colonel Lindbergh

The situation in Europe greatly affects the United States, because our relationship with her is not a relationship with one of the belligerents, but with both sides. We are materially and spiritually concerned about the well-being of both belligerents. In the spiritual aspect, we are concerned with preserving European civilization; in the material aspect, we need to preserve the strength of Europe. In either aspect, what we need is a united and not a divided nation.

This European war will be protracted, which is not beneficial to either the United States or Western civilization. The longer the war lasts, the weaker our national family will be, and the more likely it will be to invite foreign disasters. American policy should always be against the mutual killing of the homeland, and should use our strength as an example to promote peace.

But we must not deceive ourselves into thinking that we can promote peace in Europe by participating in the war or guaranteeing treaties. If we want to lay a lasting peace, we should avoid and not repeat the mistakes of the Treaty of Versailles. Those who have the ability to fight should abandon their ambition to fight. This matter is of great importance, there is no way to follow, only to use wisdom, no guarantee, only satisfaction.

The last European war has proven the mistake of the United States sending fleets to Europe to participate in the war. The victory we promoted not only failed to establish justice and righteousness, but the self-killing war has become more intensified. We cannot force peace on a powerful nation that has no intention of peace. Anyone who has read the history of Britain, Germany, and France knows that the idea of conquest often exceeds the pursuit of peace when there is an opportunity.

Our policy should be to quell the war in Europe within the realm of possibility, otherwise we should stand aside and let the various European countries find their own way home. By watching from the sidelines, we will have a strong Western country left to preserve the torch of culture and lead the way in the European ruins. If Western civilization does not share the same fate as Roman civilization, Greek civilization, Egyptian civilization, and Babylonian civilization, then the torch of culture should be kept among us. (Abridged translation from Atlantic Monthly)

### President Roosevelt's Words

The idea of ​​North and South America being able to close themselves off is not only useless, but also impossible. If our country's national defense policy is based on this idea, it will only invite future attacks. The various events of the past two weeks have dispelled many illusions of the isolationist faction. Their illusion that the United States is in a remote location and can isolate itself for protection has also been eliminated. We are now becoming more realistic, but we should not underestimate our own strength.

At this moment, the whole world, including the American hemisphere, is being threatened by great destruction. North and South America must quickly replenish their military equipment to deal with everything. The way of life we ​​want to protect and create is not only for the Americas, but for all mankind. Our responsibility is great and our mission is noble.

I pray day and night for peace in this crazy world. All of our countrymen must be in the same prayer. In a common devotion to mankind, we pray that God will heal the injuries of mankind and soothe the hearts of mankind.

### Looking at the Sky Through a Tube

Last month, on the twenty-first day, the two Empress Dowagers and the Emperor departed from the capital to Huiling to perform the ceremony of eternal burial. Wooden walls were set up next to the imperial chariot to prevent the common people from peeking, which is etiquette. However, a certain Westerner, having no way to look at the sky and longing for the sun, wanted to rent a house next to the imperial road in the capital and privately open a window to peek at the arrival of the holy chariot; as a result, he endured many hardships and lay in ambush outside the city before he was able to catch a glimpse of the Emperor's face. When the man first left the capital, he carried luggage, along with one Manchu servant and one Beijing servant, as if he were a traveler on a long journey, and looked for an inn to stay in. There were many military officers in the inn. When they saw the man arrive, the innkeeper refused to let him stay, and specially reported to the officials, politely saying to the man that this place was not very convenient, and that it would be better to find a quiet place elsewhere. The man said that he still felt comfortable here, and that he was tired for many days and did not want to move to another place. The officials did not listen, and immediately sent soldiers to forcibly lead the man to a remote temple, and also asked the man's name and what he had come for? They were very verbose, and the soldiers who were sent kept guard and did not leave the man's side, not allowing the man to take a step out of the temple gate. However, the man was determined to go out, so he allowed them to do what they wanted for the time being, and toured the temple briefly. At six o'clock, the gate was closed and locked. The man saw a broken wall next to the temple that could be crossed over, and the soldiers urged him to go inside, and the man listened to them. After a while, he used a trick to send the soldiers to another room, and the man immediately crossed the wall and went out.

### How to Commemorate "June 3rd Festival"?

— Long Ju Sheng

Children, tomorrow (June 3rd) is the annual "June 3rd" Commemoration Day again!

June 3rd is two important commemoration days, one is the commemoration of Lin Zexu of the Qing Dynasty burning opium of British merchants, and the other is the commemoration of the strike of the Shanghai business community. Now, they are described separately as follows, children, please remember and don't forget!

(1) In the nineteenth year of Daoguang (1839 AD), Lin Zexu was appointed Governor-General of Liangguang to investigate and handle the opium ban at the seaports. Lin enforced the ban vigorously and burned more than 20,000 boxes of opium transported by British merchants at Humen. It was the 73rd year before the Republic of China (1839 AD) on June 3rd. After the establishment of the National Government, this day was designated as the "Drug Ban Commemoration Day", called "June 3rd Commemoration".

(2) In May of the eighth year of the Republic of China (1919 AD), our eastern neighbor forced us to recognize the Twenty-One Demands. Students in Peiping launched the May Fourth Movement, and many students were arrested. On June 3rd, the Shanghai business community went on strike as a whole, and the inland also responded one after another! The Northern Government finally dismissed Cao (Rulin), Zhang (Zongxiang), and Lu (Zongyu), and released the students. The matter subsided. This was the first time that our country's business community participated in a political movement, so it is also called "June 3rd Commemoration".

Children, Lin Zexu's firmness, decisiveness, unyielding, and indomitable spirit and achievements are enough to compete with the sun and the moon! Lin's being demoted to Yili also shows the darkness and confusion of the politicians of the Qing Dynasty.

The Twenty-One Demands of the country's demise not only awakened the students' fighting spirit, but also alerted those who were absorbed in profit and did not avoid the country's demise, and realized the current common unity of fighting for national liberation. Isn't there a reason for this? However, the general treacherous merchants on the isolated island who take advantage of the national crisis to speculate in trade and oppress the people's lives have not yet shown any signs of understanding, which is really regrettable! I hope that when children see their fathers, mothers, or older brothers and sisters (who are married) behaving in the above-mentioned ways, they will earnestly plead with them and tell them the meaning of "June 3rd Commemoration". This is the responsibility that every child should fulfill!

### Commemorating Mr. Lin Zexu

— Lu Lishi

Children, tomorrow is the Tobacco Ban Commemoration Day, let me tell you a story.

During the Daoguang reign of the Qing Dynasty, Lin Zexu was the Governor-General of Huguang. He hated opium very much, so he asked the Qing government to ban it strictly. The Qing government paid attention to his report and sent him as an imperial envoy to Guangdong to investigate. When he arrived in Guangzhou, he strictly arrested treacherous merchants selling opium, and ordered British merchants to hand over all the opium they had hidden. The British merchants refused, so Lin sent troops to surround the British merchant ships and cut off their food supply. The British merchants had no choice but to hand over 20,283 boxes of opium. He transported this much opium to the coast of Humen and burned it all.

Later, the British government sent many warships to attack Guangdong first. Because Lin's defense was tight, they could not capture it, so they turned to attack various coastal areas, and then attacked Tianjin in the north, and then captured Zhenjiang, directly approaching Nanjing. The Manchu Qing government not only did not punish the officials stationed in these places, but said that Lin Zexu was wrong and should not have started the war lightly. So Lin Zexu was dismissed from office and punished, and people were sent to negotiate peace with the British army and sign the Treaty of Nanjing. This happened in the twenty-second year of Daoguang.

Since the failure of this opium ban, foreign opium can be transported to China in a grand and aboveboard manner, poisoning it endlessly. Since the Republic of China, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has advocated strictly banning opium, so June 3rd is designated as the Opium Ban Commemoration Day, and the people of the whole country are vigilant and reflect on it.

### The Museum Will Hold a Competition for School Children's Collection Items

— A Jin

The Shanghai Museum, jointly organized by the Asian Literary Association and Shangxiantang at No. 20 Museum Road in this city, intends to promote educational effectiveness, encourage school children to collect and collect, and encourage primary and secondary school students to use summer vacations to have more contact with the natural world: The news that a competition and exhibition of school children's collection items will be held in the autumn of this year has been seen in the Education News column of this newspaper on the 30th of last month. However, the record is still lacking in detail, so I will add it below to inform the readers of this publication.

The purpose of this event is purely to encourage children to feel the interest in collecting, and it is also an important way to increase knowledge; and to prevent them from wasting their holidays, and to use them to explore and improve themselves. The confirmed date is in September after the summer vacation this year; the detailed methods have not yet been decided, and will be announced later. However, from now on, regardless of natural specimens, and favorite items such as coins, cigarette pictures, stamps, toys, etc., all those collected and collected by school children on weekdays or in the future; can be registered with the administrative section of the hospital, using personal names, or using school names to participate in groups is even more welcome.

### Daylight Saving Time Movement

— Xin Liang

Children, you probably all know that the Daylight Saving Time Movement has started under the approval of the工部局(Gōngbùjú) from yesterday (June 1st). What is the Daylight Saving Time Movement? When we explore its meaning, we can know that it is to set the town point one hour faster during the four months (June 1st to September 31st) of the summer when the days are long and the nights are short; in this way, we can get up earlier in the first half of the day, and get an extra hour in the second half of the day to recover from the fatigue of the first half of the day or do some considerable entertainment.

Summarizing the results of all aspects, promoting the Daylight Saving Time Movement has more advantages than disadvantages, so everyone should promote and practice it vigorously.

What time did you get up today? The author knows that there are many children who always get up late every day, and sometimes they have to wait for their mothers to wake them up. They will never get up on their own. Now, you shouldn't be like this anymore. The first key point of the Daylight Saving Time Movement is to tell everyone to get up early. Getting up early and going to bed early is the secret to strengthening the body.

Secondly, what we should pay special attention to here is that in the extra hour in the afternoon, we must not use it for playing and playing. Taking this opportunity, we can read a few more books and do more meaningful extracurricular activities. We must all know that this hour is definitely not for us to go home early and watch a play with our parents, or to go to the road to "ride bicycles", "skate", or "build houses"!

Finally, I would like to hope with 120,000 points of sincerity that all of you children can get some progress in body, mind, and knowledge from the "Daylight Saving Time Movement", so that it will not fail the original intention of saving.

### Epidemic

— Jin Zhen

"What does the pathogen look like? Why have I never seen it?"

"You say you've never seen it, and you can't blame you, because the pathogen is a very tiny bacteria, so our naked eyes can't see it, but it can be seen under a microscope. The scope of bacteria is very large and there are many types, and pathogens are one of the bacteria, but there are so many types of pathogens that can be the same. Every disease has a pathogen. However, the shapes of bacteria are nothing more than spherical, rod-shaped, and spiral-shaped. Although the shapes of various bacteria are different, they are generally similar. The reproduction of bacteria is really rapid. Each bacterium divides once every half hour. Imagine that after 24 hours a day, their division number is really amazing. In other words, they are waiting for the opportunity to invade the human body at all times, that is, we are likely to get sick at any time. Although their reproduction is so fast, they die when they see sunlight, so their mortality rate is also very high. Not all bacteria are harmful. The yeast bacteria during fermentation are of great benefit to us, but pathogens are indeed our unforgettable enemies."

"Then, will we get sick every time a pathogen invades the human body?"

"No, this depends on the strength of the human body, because when bacteria invade our body, the white blood cells in the blood seem to be ordered to declare war on the bacteria, so a big battle occurs. If our body is strong, then the white blood cells are very brave, and the resistance force is also very strong. Of course, they are invincible and invincible, and the bacteria are annihilated. If the body is not strong, then the white blood cells are disheartened and discouraged, and have to beg the bacteria for mercy and reconciliation. As a result, the bacteria destroy the body's tissues one by one in the body without restraint, so we go to hire a doctor for diagnosis and treatment, injections and medicine, that is, to add a new force to the white blood cells and invigorate them. Finally, the hateful bacteria are destroyed, and the body's tissues are reconstructed, that is, the body recovers its health."

### Two Farmers and Clouds — Flynn's Fable —

— Zhao Yilin

There were two farmers walking together. A said to B in a pitiful tone that he believed the black clouds over there were a sign of misfortune. William replied cheerfully, "Why?" John replied, "I bet it's going to hail. The wheat will be damaged, and not a single ear of wheat will be left, followed by famine." William said kindly, "You're really dreaming! On the lead-colored clouds, I can't see anything else, but there's a lot of rain hidden inside. This rain will not only not harm, but will make us a bumper harvest. This year will be a ripe year, so let's be happy. Have a glass of ale to thank this rain!" John said angrily, "You're talking nonsense!" William also retorted, "You're blind!" The quarrel started like this, and the more they quarreled, the more fierce it became, almost to the point of fighting. Suddenly, a gust of wind came and dispersed the clouds. As a result, neither of them argued anymore!

### Shirley Temple's Autobiography (5)

— Min

Since I took my first dance class, I have been practicing the little tiptoe steps very hard. If there is no work in the studio, I am always jumping around in the house and garden all day long. Jack and Sanan have to go to school to study every day, but I keep disturbing them, insisting that they watch me dance. They hate it very much and shout at me, "Get out of here, get out of here! Shirley, don't always pester us." At that time, I didn't hate them either, because there was really nothing to see in this kind of dance step, just jumping up and down and slightly shaking the toes.

Now my two brothers are proud of me because of me. The day before yesterday, Jack and two classmates came back from Stanford University, and took them upstairs to see me in my doll room. He said to his two classmates very wisely, "The one sitting on the floor over there is my little sister Shirley." Then he wanted to prove that I was indeed his sister, so he lowered his head and kissed me. But his two classmates could never do that. As for Sanan, I have also heard him boast to his classmates at the New Mexico Military Academy, praising my little sister so much. The beginning was the beginning, and now is now; at the beginning, the two of them really didn't like my dancing.

But after I took the fifth and sixth dance classes, my feet became much more proficient. I have danced the steps very well, and I can already dance the soft shoe tap dance. When I practice at home, if I don't turn on the radio, I hum softly in my mouth. What I often hum is the Yellow River tune, and soon I have sung it very well. Sometimes my mother plays the piano for me, pressing the keys with only two fingers, and I sing along. Even until recently, whenever I needed to sing in a starring film, I always practiced like this beforehand. Mr. Sheehan, who presided over the Fox Studio, encouraged me to learn piano formally, so he sent me a small piano, which is still placed in the flat house on the studio, and I go to play it from time to time.

### Self-Control

Young people, lacking or possessing little experience as a foundation, are not qualified to be the ultimate authority on morality. Moral standards should not be deemed wrong simply because they oppose them. They sometimes bring up many questions to ask ministers, and come up with all sorts of answers, not knowing that their answers have long been seen many times in history. For example, their "self-expressionism" was something that people in Greece had spoken of thousands of years ago. The saying, "Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we may die," though worded differently, has the same meaning. Of course, so-called moral standards do not require us to accept them without question, and they are not necessarily good just because they have existed for many years. However, some are derived from experience and are not wrong. The Ten Commandments are eternal truths, and no matter how many ages pass, the standards of right and wrong cannot be changed. Those who violate the commandments immediately suffer the consequences, like an echo responding to a sound. Otherwise, wouldn't the world become a madhouse, and how could human affairs be maintained? Only when people adhere to morality can culture progress. The fundamental laws of conduct are eternal, universally applicable, neither old nor new. Those who ignore or violate them will inevitably face danger. Young people say, "Go your own way," but we must ask, "Are you worthy of expressing yourself?" Freedom certainly does not mean no governance. A free life is one lived under the governance of a great purpose and self-confidence. A ship with a captain can reach its port on time; otherwise, it will drift aimlessly, and the danger is extreme. People achieve their goals through governance. Paul said, "Everyone who competes in the games goes into strict training." A life without restraint is unlawful and can lead to the ruin of individuals and nations. I believe that valuable "self-expressionism" comes from the strictest self-control. Anyone who wants to gain life must seek it through self-control and training. Obeying the laws of conduct and practicing strict self-control is the secret to achieving a perfect and powerful life. (The End)

Movie Star Awards

### The Adored Performers

— Xin Fang

Movie stars who have won awards prove that their acting skills are unparalleled. Logically, they deserve to be proud in front of everyone. But what is the actual situation? They all have stars they admire in their own eyes.

Charles Laughton, who won the Best Actor Award in 1933, most admired the famous screen comedian Charlie Chaplin in his life. At a Hollywood banquet, he told a female reporter from a British magazine: "It amazes me why an actor like Chaplin has never won an award. If someone asked me to choose the three best films in film history, I would choose all the masterpieces he starred in!"

Paul Muni, who won the award in 1936, said on weekdays: "I respect all the stars who have a little specialty." After watching "The Story of Louis Pasteur" last year, Robert Donat became the star he admired most. Conversely, Robert Donat, who won the award last year because of that film, reportedly admires Paul Muni!

Bette Davis has won two awards. She does not have innate beauty. She is supported by fans because of her acting skills, so it is not easy to have a star she admires. Who is it, do you know? It is Errol Flynn. "If you ask him to play a tough movie, he can pick up a bow, get on his horse, and gallop between the wild valleys and mountains. If you ask him to play a soft one, he can be considerate and make people feel happy." These are the words Bette Davis commented on him!

Victor McLaglen won the award in 1935 for starring in "The Informer." Because the films he starred in were consistently crude, the stars he admired could not escape the heroic flavor. The late Douglas Fairbanks was the star he admired most. It is said that when the bad news of Fairbanks' death first reached his ears, he, who never shed tears, could not help but shed a few drops.

### Interview with Ma Lianliang (Part 2)

— Master of the Ai Ping Studio

Most Fond of Recording

(Question) I heard that you have made the most recordings. How many are there in total?

(Answer) I have been most fond of recording in my life, and I have a special interest in it. I believe that people in this world must have something that can be commemorated and passed on to future generations. Since we are performers, the only thing that can be used for later generations to commemorate is singing. Therefore, I am extremely happy to do recording, and it does not start today. I have heard of co-recordings with colleagues, such as "Fishing and Killing the Family" with Mr. Mei Lanfang, "Sang Yuan Hui" with Mr. Shang Xiaoxia, etc., too many to remember, but most of them are self-recorded. Among them, many plays are no longer performed later, and after recording, they can be saved as a souvenir. There are also various recordings that have never been performed, such as the two plays of "Da Zhou Xing Long". Although I have them in my records, I have never performed them outside. Another example is the play "Feng Yun Hui", which has never been performed, but has been recorded. According to statistics, I have recorded more than 110 kinds of films in various companies as of 1929, which seems to be the most recorded among my colleagues. However, later, I joined Ms. Wang Yurong to record the entire Wu Jia Po, etc., and its number is probably more than one hundred and ten kinds!

(Question) I heard that you founded a recording company. When was it?

(Answer) This was in the spring of 1932. I saw that the recording business was very developed in foreign countries, so I united with comrades in the education field, such as Mr. Ma Buyun, Hong Jiying, and Shen Mugong, and hired two American technicians. The address of the company was in Yu Yu Hutong and Bingzha Hutong in the eastern city of the old capital. Unfortunately, the success of a business is very difficult. After spending a lot of money without success, I was disheartened and announced the closure of the business!

On this day, Mr. Ma talked for a long time. Mr. Ma's eloquence was very strong, like a flood of water. Mr. Huan Sun also added some information, which made my pen almost unable to record everything. Moreover, because of the urgent time, it is difficult to guarantee that the record is accurate. I hope readers and Mr. Ma will forgive me. (The End)

Chapter 1 "A Very Pretty Lady!"

This morning, the weather was such that one could not do without a undershirt inside a dress shirt. The sky had cleared up. Patches of white clouds, some deep, some light, moved very quickly, setting off the most beautiful azure background, conjuring up all kinds of strange beasts and weird rocks. The scene changed with its movement. The new leaves on the French paulownia trees on the sidewalk outside our door were washed by the rain the night before and became more fertile and verdant. If there was a way to estimate it, the speed of growth this night must have increased more than usual.

I was alone in the downstairs office having a simple breakfast—congee. Hawthorne's morning outdoor exercise had not yet finished. This was an old habit that he had maintained for decades, and it was a good habit that I agreed with but never had the courage to implement. Suddenly, a clear doorbell broke the silence of the morning, which made me stop my chopsticks. It was not Hawthorne coming back, he did not need to press the doorbell. But why did the visitor come so early? Then, Shi Gui's footsteps opened the door and came in. He reported to me, "Mr. Bao, a lady." He lowered his voice a little and added—"A very pretty lady!——"

Shi Gui—Hawthorne's old servant, and also our old servant—was getting old, but his appreciation of beauty clearly had not been lost or diminished. His report made me a little embarrassed. Because I was not dressed yet, I was only wearing a blue-striped white cotton robe, and my feet were bare, wearing a pair of brown leather slippers. It seemed inconvenient to see guests like this, especially female guests. But in fact, I could not hesitate at all. The female guest had already walked into Hawthorne's office, which served as a dining room, with the sound of high heels.—(2)

(9) Ten Beauties Picture

It was during the Jiajing period of the Ming Dynasty.

The so-called ten beauties do not all belong to one person, but are divided between the Zeng brothers; Zeng Rong got six of them, and Zeng Gui got four.

The Zeng brothers are descendants of loyal and good people, but most of the ten beauties are the daughters of powerful and treacherous officials. Yan Lanzhen is Yan Song's daughter-in-law, and Zhao Wanzhen is Zhao Wenhua's daughter. The Yue opera "Pan Fu Suo Fu" is the love triangle story of Zeng Rong, Yan Lanzhen and Zhao Wanzhen.

The whole book takes the story of treacherous parties framing loyal and good people as the warp, and the love affairs of children as the weft.
