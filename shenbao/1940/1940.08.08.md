### Over Sixty Japanese Warships in Taiwan Suddenly Sail Towards the South China Sea: Chinese Sources Believe it is a Threat to Hong Kong; US Ambassador Visits Matsuoka to Inquire About French-Japanese Negotiations

Chongqing - Well-informed Chinese sources recently stated that over sixty Japanese warships anchored off the coast of Taiwan have been ordered to sail towards the South China Sea. It is believed this movement of Japanese warships is a threat to Hong Kong. Furthermore, the Japanese military authorities are reportedly conscripting Chinese people in Guangzhou, with 7,000 having been conscripted since the end of July. (Reuters, 7th)

Manila - This morning, American naval sources stated that a large group of Japanese warships sailed south from Taiwan today. It is unknown whether the Japanese warships are sailing to French Indochina or Palau Island, but American naval sources believe the destination of the Japanese warships is Palau Island (Note: This island was formerly German-owned, but is now under Japanese trusteeship. It is located east of the Philippines, with an area of 175 square miles and a population of 5,000). (Reuters, 7th)

Hong Kong - Passengers arriving in Hong Kong from Shanghai today stated that they saw Japanese transport ships and warships engaged in large-scale activities south of Taiwan. They witnessed a fleet of eighteen transport ships sailing south from Taiwan. (Reuters, 7th)

London - The London Daily Express received news from Hong Kong that eighteen Japanese transport ships, closely guarded, were seen sailing south from Taiwan, possibly heading to Vietnam. However, this news has not yet been confirmed. Furthermore, the Daily Mail received news from the French-Spanish border that France is determined to resist if Vietnam is attacked. Generally, people here believe that since Tokyo may again request naval bases, France and Japan may engage in naval combat in Vietnam. Although the French military strength in Vietnam is insufficient to resist large-scale invasions, it is generally expected that the French residents there will not willingly surrender. The Governor-General of Vietnam, Vice Admiral Decoux, insists that all Japanese demands must be negotiated with the Vichy government. Many observers believe that the Governor-General's strong stance is of great significance. However, the Japanese ambassador to Vietnam has been treated with exceptional deference and has completed extensive military and economic surveys of the colony. (International News Agency, 7th)

Tokyo - A spokesman for the Japanese Foreign Ministry stated while addressing reporters that rumors that Japan and France are negotiating to obtain army and navy bases within French Indochina are completely untrue. (Haitong Agency, 7th)

Japan Denies Making Demands on Vietnam; Ambassador Gu Inquires with France About the True Situation

Tokyo - The United States Ambassador to Japan, Joseph Grew, met with Japanese Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka this afternoon to inquire about rumors that Japan and France are currently engaged in negotiations regarding Vietnam. According to semi-official Japanese sources, the Foreign Minister replied that the rumors mentioned are not true. (Reuters, 7th)

Vichy - The Chinese Ambassador to France, Gu Weijun, recently visited the French Foreign Minister Paul Baudouin and the Minister of Colonies, René Lémery, to discuss the political and economic negotiations between France and Japan and Japan's request for military bases in Vietnam. It is reported that Ambassador Gu requested the two ministers to provide information on Japan's request to use Vietnam as a base and the increased exchange of raw materials and manufactured goods between Japan and Vietnam. (Reuters, 7th)

Hong Kong - According to reliable Japanese sources arriving here from Hanoi, the negotiations in Hanoi are becoming increasingly difficult. Although the source is very skeptical about whether Japan has made a request to France to establish bases in Vietnam (according to Vichy sources, the negotiations are underway), it admits that Japan's demands on Vietnam may become stronger. During the absence of the Japanese inspector-in-chief, Nishihara, who has returned to Japan, his deputy is Sato. Sato is a member of the Japanese military and is a leader of the Japanese army in southern China stationed in Guangzhou, and was formerly the spokesperson for the Japanese army in Tokyo. This Japanese reporter stated that Sato is currently working hard to obtain the cooperation of the French side to end the Sino-Japanese War and said that his requests include allowing the transport of Japanese troops from Haiphong along the railway to the Vietnamese border and the establishment of Japanese supply depots on the Vietnamese coast. The source also said that the Japanese may intend to intercept existing Chinese military supplies in the Haiphong warehouses. These Chinese military supplies include American vehicles, rubber tires, machinery, gasoline, etc., for which payment has already been made by China. It is reported that the value of these stocks is eight million US dollars. (Reuters, 7th)

Tokyo - The Yomiuri Shimbun reported that Colonel Sato, a key Japanese official stationed in French Indochina, has been ordered to negotiate with the French authorities to extend the effective period of the order prohibiting the transport of military supplies across the border to General Chiang Kai-shek. The original order is scheduled to expire on August 6th. (Haitong Agency, 7th)

### Three American Newspapers Publish Articles Condemning Japan's Southern Advance

The New York Post stated that Western reaction and Eastern barbarism are two sides of the same coin, and the recent blockade by the administration is a way to correct this phenomenon. The New York Mirror stated that Japan openly said it would obtain oil and iron from the Dutch East Indies, but Secretary of State Hull responded with "get out of here." (Reuters, 7th)

Editorial

### The South China Sea Crisis and Vietnam

While there are still no signs that Germany will launch a blitzkrieg against England, the situation in the South China Sea has been increasingly tense in recent days. It is said that negotiations between Japan and Vietnam on the establishment of military bases are underway, and the movement of the Japanese fleet in the South China Sea, which began in late July, has reached a serious level. On the surface, the most eye-catching event in the world recently is the mutual arrest of expatriates by England and Japan, but as long as the Japanese government does not change its current "wait-and-see attitude," this dispute may be temporarily resolved through easing. As for the crisis in the South Pacific, it seems to be growing. The complex situation and various weaknesses in that area may not be able to mount a strong and effective resistance to aggression under the current circumstances, which is why Japan openly includes Vietnam, the Dutch East Indies, and even the islands of India, Burma, and the Philippines within its "New Order." If the Anglo-German war enters a stage of close combat, it will be a good time for the Far Eastern aggressors to realize their southern ambitions.

Among the many units in Southeast Asia, the one most coveted by Japan is naturally the Dutch East Indies, and the most pressing crisis is Vietnam. Although the economic resources of Vietnam are also considerable, they are ultimately inferior to those of the Dutch East Indies. However, its strategic value is higher than that of the Dutch East Indies, because to implement the southward advance, the land and coast of Vietnam are the most important military strongholds. Even taking China's Hainan Island as an example, it seems to command the entire South China Sea, but without a strong naval base on the west coast of the South China Sea, the battle for that area will be doubly difficult. Therefore, the importance of the South Island is actually inferior to that of Vietnam. Moreover, since the South China Sea islands have been occupied by Japan one after another, and the Yonglong area, which is secretly connected to the northern border of Vietnam, has been harassed, Vietnam, although important, already seems to be under remote control. Therefore, Japan can use the close proximity of Chinese and Vietnamese territory to carry out its dual-purpose method under the slogan of "resolving the China Incident." It not only gains the convenience of attacking the southwest rear of China, but also conceals its ambition to invade southward, unlike the Dutch East Indies, which has the great concern of the United Kingdom and the United States, and is far separated from the Japanese army's rear. In this way, it is no wonder that it is only negotiating and investigating the Dutch East Indies, while it is already wielding a knife and testing France and Vietnam.

If the world wants to truly understand the South China Sea crisis, it must first dispel the confusion of various smokescreens. For the past three years, Japan's offensive against third countries has almost always used slogans such as "resolving the China Incident" as a pretext to coerce them into making concessions. Various countries have been misled by this, and China has suffered limited harm, while third countries have suffered endless damage. There are almost countless examples of this. Taking the Vietnamese authorities' promise to ban Japanese embargo demands as an example, according to a Reuters news report on the 6th, Japan has used this right to engage in activities that go beyond the scope, and even demanded the establishment of naval bases in Vietnam. This not only violates French sovereignty, but is also difficult to explain as meeting the military needs of China, which has no navy at all. However, this kind of smokescreen diplomacy has repeatedly deceived the world in the past, and even deceived the authorities of the great powers, making them abandon justice and fairness, and even legal principles, in order to cater to the intentions of the aggressors. These great powers' lack of vigilance and foresight is an important reason for the recent crisis in the South Pacific. It is worth remembering that when the Japanese army invaded and occupied Hainan Island last spring, the highest authority in China pointed out that it was the "September 18th Incident" of the Pacific Ocean. Unfortunately, that warning did not cause due reaction in the international community, and there was no effective prevention to remove the stovepipes and change the firewood early. The recent British measure to block the滇缅 Road was defended on the grounds that the United Kingdom was engaged in a war of life and death, and the submission of the French and Vietnamese authorities to Japanese demands was because they were seeking peace after a defeat, so they had no power to resist. As for these, let us not argue about them. However, before this kind of bad luck came, why did they never consider the future crisis in the Far East and make plans early? This cannot but be diagnosed with the current authorities of some great powers, who are accustomed to seeking ease and lack long-term vision and upright courage.

According to a Reuters report from Vichy, the French attitude towards Japan has become stronger and they are determined to resist any attack on Vietnam, and are also preparing in military terms. This news is truly like hearing the sound of footsteps in an empty valley. The Franco-German peace treaty allowed France to retain a considerable navy to protect its colonies, but the defensive strength of Vietnam is still pitifully weak. The Japanese are even extremely arrogant, saying that they can conquer it with just one division. Therefore, even if the French have determination, it is difficult to achieve effective self-defense without taking prompt measures. In fact, France has been held hostage by Germany and Italy in Europe, but it still has freedom of action in the Far East. First, it is important to recognize that the so-called strengthening of ties between Germany and Italy is only a one-sided fantasy of Japan. Germany and Italy will not only not encourage Japan's attempt to seize French colonies, but will rather be jealous of it. The French and Vietnamese authorities should recognize this contradiction in order to strengthen Vietnam's military strength. Second, the United Kingdom and France still have the same interests and positions in the Far East. In times of emergency, they should abandon their grievances and work together to devise effective measures based on the principle of joint defense. They should also engage in active contact and use with other countries with significant interests in the Far East, such as the United States. Third, it is important to recognize that China's resistance has always been an important factor in stabilizing the Far East. For example, the recent tightening of the deployment of the Chinese army on the Vietnamese border in Guangxi and Guizhou, and the counterattacks in the Longzhou Shuikou Funan area are not only to consolidate China's rear, but also to reduce the pressure on Vietnam. The French and Vietnamese authorities should not only not continue to take measures that harm China's war of resistance, but should also maintain close contact with it and work together to ensure the safety of the South Asian continent. Historically, China and Vietnam have had blood relations, and in reality, China and Vietnam have inseparable interests.

The defeat in Europe has put France in a tragic abyss, but if it can succeed in protecting Vietnam in the Far East through strong and correct use, it will inevitably form the cornerstone of France's revival. I hope to give this intention to the current French and Vietnamese authorities.

### Incident of Arresting Overseas Chinese; Japan Declares its Position to the UK; Awaits the UK's Response Before Taking Action; Singapore Intensifies Military Preparedness

Tokyo - Foreign Minister Matsuoka told the cabinet yesterday that the Japanese government had notified the British government of Japan's position on the "unreasonable" arrests of Japanese expatriates in the British Empire. The Japanese government is now awaiting the British response before taking action. (Reuters, 7th)

London - A spokesman for the Japanese Embassy here said yesterday that although there have been "minor incidents and misunderstandings," "we are confident that this matter will be quickly resolved satisfactorily." He also said that "according to indications from all sides, relations between Japan and the United Kingdom will continue to improve." (Reuters, 7th)

Anti-British Movement Spreads Throughout Japan

Tokyo - Anti-British demonstrations in Japan are spreading throughout the country. The Greater Japan Youth Party is demanding that the Army Department take a firm attitude to deal with Britain. The External Affairs Department has also received the same request from various national groups. (Haitong Agency, 7th)

Tokyo - Japanese newspapers and semi-official organizations continue to demand that the authorities take strong action against Britain to ensure that all Japanese expatriates detained in the British Empire are released immediately. However, the Japanese government's wait-and-see attitude seems to be gradually taking effect. The release of Zhiyuan and the Japanese announcement that some ten British expatriates banned in Japan have been allowed to return to their residences seem to have eased the situation slightly, but it cannot be said that the tension has passed. Yesterday, various public organizations sent representatives to the British Embassy to present resolutions demanding the immediate release of the arrested Japanese expatriates, and threatened to take "severe measures" against Britain if this was not done. At the same time, newspapers continue to curse Britain with extremely venomous words. The general public is relatively calm about rumors that Japanese ships may not be allowed to dock in Hong Kong. (Reuters, 7th)

Tokyo - The Tokyo City Council yesterday submitted a request to the British Ambassador to Japan, Clark, to respond to the British arrest of Japanese expatriates by asking Britain "not to act in the Far East."

Tokyo - Public outrage is growing in Japan over the British authorities' arrest of Japanese expatriates. Important members of the Tokyo City Council have gone to various cities to hold protest rallies. Yesterday, they also resolved to hold a mass demonstration on August 12, in which representatives from one hundred and twenty cities will participate. Japanese newspapers reported that tens of thousands of Japanese from various cities will come to Tokyo to hold demonstrations in front of the British Embassy and government offices. The Houchi Shimbun reported that Redman, the Far East Director of the British Intelligence Department, should be arrested, as he is the number one British spy stationed in Japan. Other staff members of the British spy agency should also be detained. (Haitong Agency, 7th)

Tokyo - According to "Japanese Temple Newspaper", several arrested British expatriates have been released from prison, but are still being held in their residences. (Haitong Agency, 7th)

### US Army and Air Force Conduct Large-Scale Exercises; Over 80,000 Participants; The St. Lawrence Seaway is the Hypothetical Target

Ogdensburg - Over 80,000 regular and National Guard troops are concentrating here today to participate in military exercises in the upper half of New York State. The hypothetical battle is the "Battle of the St. Lawrence." As of last night, more than 6,000 officers and soldiers had arrived in the 1,300-square-mile area, and more than 10,000 others (mostly air force and air defense troops) will arrive by Saturday. At that time, Brigadier General Charles, the commander of the recently established Air Defense Command, will command the anti-aircraft defenses of the land forces. At the request of the Army, the US Defense Forces are conscripting 2,800 citizens in the 1,680-square-mile area to deploy in 347 volunteer "alert stations." At the same time, 46 state forest fire towers will be used as lookout towers to detect the movement of "enemy" aircraft in "wartime." When an "enemy" aircraft is discovered, the volunteer lookout will immediately notify the Air Defense Headquarters in Watertown by telephone. Operators in the headquarters, who are long-term employees, will face a map marked with the locations of the lookout towers. When the lookout issues a notice, he will state the type, number, speed, longitude, and direction of the aircraft, so that the command headquarters can intercept it. At least 162 aircraft will participate in the exercise, with the hypothetical target of occupying the St. Lawrence Seaway, as the area is traditionally the gateway to American industry. The attacking army will land in Boston and advance towards New York State to occupy the seaway. (Reuters, 7th)

### Roosevelt Praises Pan-American Solidarity; Announces New Defense Plan; Plans to Form a Domestic Guard

Hyde Park, New York - After having lunch here yesterday with representatives from four Latin American countries attending the Pan-American Conference, President Roosevelt told reporters that the spirit of Pan-American solidarity is now more of an established fact than ever before. The results of this conference are very interesting and can be said to be very successful. The president then answered a reporter's question and said that the sale of aviation fuel is limited to countries in the Western Hemisphere. This move can be said to be clear evidence that the Americas are now seeking to establish material and economic unity after spiritual unity. This restriction can also be seen as a comprehensive defense plan. The United States and other American countries are unable to supply aviation fuel to Europe and Asia due to national defense needs. (Reuters, 7th)

Hyde Park - Roosevelt took another step forward in the defense movement yesterday, as he announced his new plan to form a new domestic guard with veterans who participated in the Great War as the core. (International News Agency, 7th)

### Italian Troops Advance on British Somaliland in Three Routes; British Ground and Air Forces Mount a Strong Defense, Employing Camel Corps for Guerrilla Warfare

Cairo – Italian troops today crossed the high mountains of British Somaliland, beginning their first large-scale land offensive, advancing towards the strongly resisting British forces in the Gulf of Aden. The three-pronged Italian offensive in Somaliland is progressing simultaneously with fierce fighting on the Egyptian-Libyan border. One Italian army is now advancing towards the Suez Canal using a pincer movement. British communiqués state that the Italian army is effectively turning East Africa and the Mediterranean into one large battlefield. The Italian offensive is clearly intended to advance towards the highway between Harar in eastern Abyssinia and Berbera, the capital of British Somaliland. The first-rate camel corps of British East Africa is currently resisting the Italian forces. (July 7th, International Dispatch)

Cairo – A communiqué issued here last night stated that enemy forces, since August 4th, have invaded British Somaliland Protectorate in three routes, attempting to seize Awdal and Hargeisa in two routes, with the third route advancing from Jirr towards Galagal. British land and air forces are jointly resisting, and although French Somaliland has collapsed, the British army is unaffected. No news is to be reported on other lines. According to London military circles, it appears that the three Italian routes are targeting the ports of Berbera and Zeila in the Gulf of Aden, but the roads between them are long, remote, and dangerous. The British forces opposing the Italian forces are the valiant Somaliland Camel Corps. The temperature in the area is constantly at 120 degrees Fahrenheit, and the Italian advance must cross mountains as high as 1,500 feet, with only camel paths available, so Italian forces may not be able to use mechanized units. British forces are expected to implement guerrilla warfare, and the British Air Force can inflict heavy damage on the slow-moving Italian forces. (July 7th, Reuters)

London – People here generally believe that the British Navy's strict surveillance has led Rome to decide to immediately launch a combined offensive from both Abyssinia and Libya. The Italian side has realized the difficulty of maintaining troops in this area, so it has decided to attack before the Italian overseas troops weaken due to the British blockade. Currently, although there are 250,000 Italian troops stationed in Libya, only a small number can truly fight. Advancing across a waterless desert requires an unusually large number of troops to maintain rear transportation lines. The shortening of British transportation lines has allowed a large number of troops to participate in the fighting. Therefore, the further the enemy advances, the stronger the British position will become. News of the Italian concentration on the Egyptian border has not alarmed the Egyptian people, because their trust in the British army has gradually increased since the start of the war.

Initial Stage of Western Desert Warfare Concluded

Cairo – A bulletin released here last night stated that the first stage of the Western Desert war can now be considered over. During this period, a small British mobile force, with several armored vehicles and cannons, and several infantry companies, completely controlled the eastern area of the Italian Libyan colony's border. The number of Italian troops facing them across the border was numerous. Since Italy declared war, the number of Italian prisoners in the Libyan line alone has reached 808, including one general, with the loss of sixteen cannons, fifteen tanks, hundreds of casualties, and various military vehicles and materials. The British army achieved this victory due to the superior quality, well-trained and well-equipped desert army regiments, and the high morale of the British Air Force, which constantly attacked the enemy, and the constant patrols of the British Navy on the sea. The British army, navy, and air force are aware that the British side has a just cause, and they trust the outcome of the war, so the morale of all levels is high. This is in stark contrast to the hesitations and lack of confidence of the Italian army itself and the unfortunate people of Libya. Now the second stage has just begun, and how it will develop is not yet known. However, it is known that the enemy has gathered a large army in Al Naste in the Bardia area. Although the Italian manpower and material resources in the Capuzzo fort are gradually exhausted, they are still stubbornly defending it in order to protect the gathering Italian army. The new Governor of Libya, General Graziani, undoubtedly hopes to win a victory for propaganda purposes. However, judging from the evidence obtained in Gazala and Moyale, the Italian side needs ten times the number of British troops to dare to risk attacking the British positions. Now it is expected that the Italian army will eventually attack. If so, the British side is prepared and ready to strike a painful blow. (July 7th, Reuters)

Alexandria – Since the Italian army invaded British Somaliland in three routes, it is widely believed that the Italian attack on Egypt from Libya is imminent.

According to officials here, the largest concentration of Italian troops on the northern border of Egypt is undoubtedly in the Barda area, numbering approximately two divisions.

### German Announcement of British Ship Losses; Britain Calls It Exaggeration

Berlin – Yesterday, the German military department released a war report stating that during the last three weeks of July, British merchant ships and non-British ships serving the British that were sunk by the German fleet exceeded 440,000 tons. Those sunk by German submarines amounted to 145,000 tons, and those sunk by the German Air Force totaled 215,000 tons, amounting to a total of 660,000 tons. On average, 220,000 tons were sunk per week. In fact, the enemy's losses were even greater, because 328,000 tons were heavily damaged and required long-term repairs before they could be used again. In addition, British ships sunk or damaged by the German Air Force totaled 50,000 tons. (July 7th, Reuter)

London – Responsible parties in London today criticized the German command's claim that the German side sunk 679,324 tons of British ships in the last three weeks of July, saying that Germany was again exaggerating by a factor of four. The accurate figures for the three weeks from July 7th to July 28th were a total loss of 196,219 tons for British, Allied, and neutral ships. Those lost to torpedoes, mines, or aerial attacks are included. The inaccuracy of German reported figures is not entirely intentional, as the German command's figures are based on the attacker's report, and the attacker often does not know the tonnage of the ships they attacked or the results they obtained.

### Gu Xinan's Proposal to Merge Estonia - Soviet Supreme Soviet Passes Vote - Estonian Representatives About to be Elected

Moscow: The fifth joint session of the two chambers of the Soviet Union was held last night at the Kremlin, discussing the Estonian parliamentary declaration. When the Estonian delegation entered the venue, the entire assembly stood up and cheered. The chairman of the Federal Council, Anduyev, introduced the members of the Estonian plenipotentiary delegation, led by Lauristin, to speak. In his moving speech, Lauristin described the high tide of enthusiasm among the Estonian people when choosing a new system of government. He stated that before the establishment of the Soviet government, the Estonian people groaned under the oppressive rule of the rulers. Estonia's policy of completely severing ties with the Soviet Union had resulted in the decline of Estonian agriculture and industry, factory closures, and a sharp increase in unemployment. People demanded jobs as if begging for food, and the standard of living for workers was lower than in any other European country. Farmers bore a heavy burden in taxes and fines, and countless lands were auctioned off annually. All of these things led the Estonian people to the brink of destruction. Therefore, when the Soviet Supreme Soviet passed the resolution to allow Estonia to join the Soviet Union, the Estonian people would surely be extremely pleased. The parliament, elected for the first time by the people, has followed the will of the people and freely resolved the life issues of the Estonian people. Finally, Lauristin exclaimed amidst cheers, "The Estonian people eagerly hope to unite with the Soviet Union and enjoy a life of freedom and joy. Only by merging into the Soviet Union can Estonia achieve independence and development." At this point, Lauristin formally requested the Supreme Soviet to merge Estonia into the Soviet Union. Subsequently, other members of the Estonian delegation delivered speeches, making the same unanimous request. Next, the Chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the Karelo-Finnish Federal Republic, Xinan, addressed the assembly in Finnish. The deputies cheered for Gu for several minutes. Gu used the facts of his state to prove the victory of the Lenin and Stalin policies, and said that the hardworking Estonian people would soon achieve the same success. The Estonian merger bill was unanimously passed by a vote in both houses. The Soviet Supreme Soviet also decided that Estonia would elect representatives to attend the assembly. The date of the election will be determined by the Supreme Soviet. After the bill was passed, the entire assembly stood up and cheered for fifteen minutes, congratulating Stalin and his comrades. The cheers, mixed with Russian, Estonian, and Finnish, reverberated throughout the venue, proving the friendship and unity of the various nationalities of the Soviet Union. (TASS Telegraph, 7th)

### Pravda Commentary - Latvia's Merger with the Soviet Union Has International Significance

Moscow: Pravda commented today, "Yesterday, the Soviet Supreme Soviet passed the bill to merge Latvia into the Soviet Union. The resolutions passed by the Supreme Soviet in the past few days all have significant international implications. People around the world have already understood the Soviet Union's way of handling the following facts: (1) National self-determination, (2) Allowing other countries to join the Soviet Republic on the principle of equality, (3) The strengthening of the Soviet regime. Latvia's merger with the Soviet Union is undoubtedly important because the Soviet Union and the Latvian people have fought together against Tsarist landlords and capitalists for many years. In the past twenty-two years, the Latvian people have been hoping for the red flag to fly high in the sky again, and they urgently sought the Soviet Union's assistance in overthrowing the oppression of small capitalists. This wish has now been realized. They will march forward on the Soviet path. Under the banner of Lenin and Stalin, the Soviet Union has achieved great success in socialist construction in the past twenty years. Latvia can make use of this proven achievement to facilitate their work." (TASS Telegraph, 6th)

### Eight Estonian Ships Detained - Soviet Union Protests to Britain

Stockholm: Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky protested to the British Foreign Office yesterday regarding the detention of eight Estonian ships by British authorities. The merchant ships were carrying a large quantity of goods to Soviet Russia. In addition, Britain has detained several Latvian merchant ships. Since the annexation of the three countries into the Soviet Union, the merchant ships have changed to fly the Soviet flag. British authorities refused to supply coal to the ships, preventing them from sailing. Foreign observers in London believe this move is a sign of deteriorating relations between Britain and the Soviet Union. According to well-informed sources, the Bank of England still refuses to transfer the accounts of the central banks of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania to the Soviet State Bank, with only private banks complying.

### True Record of the European War (4) - The Retreat of the British and French Allied Forces

In mid-May, the German army launched a fierce attack on Flanders. At that time, there were more than 300,000 British troops fighting in France. Supporting until the beginning of June, the Allied forces were unable to resist and had to find a way to cross the English Channel and retreat back to their country. Finally, under the fierce bombardment of German heavy artillery and aircraft, relying on their discipline and strong spirit, with more than a thousand warships, transport ships, and various vessels, they created an unprecedented great retreat amidst bad weather and stormy waves. They lost 30,000 troops, 1,000 artillery pieces, and countless supplies. From a military perspective, this retreat, although successful, cannot be considered a victory. However, from another perspective, the German army put in a great deal of effort, trying to catch everything in one go, but in the end, only managed to let the enemy "retreat with all their forces," which would naturally be disappointing. This article is Sergeant Jack Wadsworth of the British Midland Regiment's firsthand account of twenty-one days of combat. He served as the rearguard and retreated from Dunkirk. The original text is translated as follows.

Our army had been stationed in the western corner of France for half a month, unable to see English newspapers, feeling somewhat isolated from the world. Fortunately, there was someone in the camp with a radio, occasionally listening to outside news. On Sunday, we learned from the radio that the German army had begun to invade the Netherlands and Belgium.

After receiving this news, everyone was visibly delighted. The brothers all said, "The time has come, we can strike a blow at the German army." At this critical moment, our army was "ready for battle."

The last day in this camp was a scorching and lovely day. That afternoon, there was no exercise, so I went out for a walk with a brother. Passing through French village alleys, farmers were tilling the land. We went to a coffee shop in the village, drank a few beers, and relieved our depression.

After returning to camp, we heard that we would be setting off immediately, but everything was still the same that night, as if the war was still thousands of miles away. The next morning, the reveille was sounded at 6:30, but the line-up call was sounded early at 5:45. The brothers inevitably became a bit chaotic, but everyone was able to cheer up. Before long, the regimental commander came to address us. He didn't say much, only, "Brothers, we are going to set off. I don't know when we will leave or where we will go. After dispersal, you can have breakfast. Then prepare everything." He paused for a moment and said again, now everyone can realize the purpose of this dispatch. He asked if anyone in the team was not as happy as he was. We shouted in unison, "No!" He smiled, showing his teeth, and then moved on.

In the afternoon, the order arrived. The entire team took a train to Lunner Station. We got off the train and waited under the shade of the trees by the road for a long time, waiting for all the baggage to be loaded onto the train. It is not easy to move a large number of troops. It is impossible to be fully equipped in an hour. It was not until 10:30 in the evening that we boarded the train again. Everyone was exhausted and fell asleep.

For two days and two nights, the train rumbled forward, with occasional long stops in between. Sometimes the train we were on stopped on a branch line, waiting for supply trains to pass. The next day, we saw refugee trains rushing towards us and passing by. There was a lot of food on the train, but mostly canned food, so we felt that the can opener attached to the back of the knife was a good friend of the soldiers on the expedition.

At several stations along the way, we often saw female vendors carrying teapots jumping off the train and boiling water on the platform. The teapots were already filled with tea leaves and sugar. This boiling water was supplied by station staff who were notified by telegraph on the train. I heard that during the previous European war, soldiers had to extract boiling water from the "dragon head" of the train if they wanted tea on the way to the front line. This time we have solved the tea problem satisfactorily. Unfortunately, the bathing problem is still pending, so everyone looked like they had been pulled out of a chimney when we arrived at our destination.

The final destination of this trip was called Qixike Lin, south of Lille. We lined up outside the station, and before long, an air raid alert came. Many people were hearing this alert for the first time, and the officers and soldiers became busy, setting up anti-aircraft guns. But in the end, it was a waste of effort, only seeing three enemy planes in the clouds. Two of our fighter planes suddenly appeared in the clouds, and the enemy planes lost their location.

After the air raid alert was lifted, we ate something in the orchard and crossed the train tracks to the bridge. We began to realize why our army stayed so briefly on the Belgian border. Looking from the Moon, there was the wreckage of a giant German bomber on the eastern railway line, and the rails had been twisted. Workers were clearing everything there. We boarded huge trucks at the bridgehead and moved forward, still not knowing where we were going.

It wasn't until we got close to the Belgian border that we first came into contact with the wartime scene. The trucks we were on were originally traveling at 30 miles per hour. Because refugees fleeing to France were surging in like a tide, the road was filled with all kinds of vehicles. Our trucks had to reduce their speed, moving as slowly as snails. The refugees were supporting the old and carrying the young, and the scene was miserable. Although we had been jolted for four days and had not rested except for dozing off, and were already exhausted, after seeing this scene of mourning, everyone couldn't help but have their blood boiling, wanting to fight the German army.

Finally, we arrived at our destination - called Wubogen, forty miles west of Brussels, with the Brussels Avenue leading directly there.

At dusk, we got off the trucks and walked into the orchard. The German air force was very active. When they flew over, there were probably 30 planes at a time, all medium bombers, flying not very high. What I found strange was why they didn't bomb the main road, which was filled with many vehicles, both military and refugee, most of which were traveling west.

Seeing the situation of these vehicles traveling, I suddenly realized that this situation was not an advance, but a retreat. Our task was to go as far as possible to serve as the rearguard. For several days in a row, we didn't get any news. One day: I think it was May 15th. One of the brothers who could speak French learned from a refugee that fierce fighting was taking place near Beijing [sic].

That night, we stayed overnight in a farmhouse near Wubogen. The cooks cheered up and made a hot meal, which was the first since we set off. Strict blackout was implemented at night. I often got up at night and wandered in the dark to see if the brothers were obeying orders. Throughout the night, we heard large numbers of German planes buzzing back and forth in the air.

Every morning, we understood our duties. The entire team was stationed at key intersections on the road, directing traffic, so that refugees would go into the fields and not stay on the road, in order to block and fight when the enemy army arrived.

At 5:00 in the morning, our army set up tank defense guns. Directing the refugees was really difficult. They could only speak the Flanders dialect, and there was a language barrier between us. If we gestured to them to leave the road, they would only pretend not to know and continue to stumble forward along the road. Some would sit down and cry incessantly. Of course, we couldn't use violence to drive away women and children, so we were at a loss. Until the brothers came up with a method. They stopped several refugees in the lead, gestured to them, pointed to the sky, then pointed to the road, and then looked at them with a terrifying expression and said, "Bomb!" After saying that, we laughed and pointed to the fields, waving our hands to tell them to go there. This method actually worked.

After the vehicles and pedestrians on the road were cleared, the rumbling of artillery fire in the distance gradually became closer. That morning, a battalion of rearguard troops was sent past. They fought fiercely along the Silper Canal to block the German army's advance. However, they were still very happy, swaying all the way, as if they were walking on the Buckingham Palace Avenue.

At noon, without yet engaging the German army, we received an order to retreat. There were very few vehicles on the road. We were inevitably a bit disheartened by the order to retreat, but because our forces were weak and there was no cover in the rear, it was useless for Britain to defend. We began to retreat and walked twenty-five miles until 1:30 in the morning. Some brothers rested in an uninhabited farmhouse. I slept on the floor under the loft, which was still comfortable.

The next day, we walked another twenty miles and spent the night in a village that looked like ruins. As soon as dawn broke, German planes began to bomb and strafe the village, continuing for two hours. Although the village roads were filled with our army's transport vehicles, there were no casualties in our army. The anti-aircraft fire confused their targets and eventually drove them away. In the following days, I never saw German planes fly close to their targets to bomb. Accurate anti-aircraft fire was certainly feared by them, but when I saw one of our Spitfire fighters appear, five or six German planes fled without a trace.

Then came another retreat—twenty miles the next day, and another twenty miles the day after. German planes always followed in groups, bombing and strafing. We gritted our teeth and moved forward. From time to time, we saw the fireworks of exploding bombs flying up in front of and behind the team, and we heard the sounds of calls for ambulances rising in quick succession. But on the whole, the number of deaths and injuries was not large.

We were very tired from armed marching in such continuous bombing. But one afternoon, we passed a certain unit, which had passed through our defense line on Brussels Avenue three days earlier. They were stopping by the road to eat, and in those three days, they had walked seventy-five miles.

That night, we arrived at Qixike Lin - returning to the place we had departed from five days ago. Once there, vehicles took us overnight to a place seven miles from Douai, where we only saw flames soaring into the sky in the city. We waited for orders in the darkness, and some of the brothers even fell asleep standing up. Douai was bombed by artillery and planes in turns, and there were many flares released by German planes in the sky, making it as bright as day. The order finally arrived, instructing our army to dig trenches along the canal embankment and hold firm. At that time, the enemy was five miles away from Douai.

### Shanghai to Implement Preparedness Starting Tomorrow - Becomes an Armed Fortress - Smaller Roads Barricaded and Blocked - Defense Forces, Business Corps, and Detectives to be Dispatched

Public Concession and French Concession military police, with the August 13th Shanghai Battle Memorial approaching, have decided to take precautions starting at 5:00 AM on the 9th (tomorrow). At that time, Shanghai will once again present a scene of heavily armed forces. Many smaller roads along Avenue Edward VII and Avenue Foch will be barricaded and blocked, with additional police stationed to prevent people carrying weapons from entering. Although the preparedness measures are the same as those taken last year, the general alert will be intensified due to the recent series of terrorist acts. The Public Concession Police Department has already tightened the implementation of the curfew. Although the French Police Department has not followed suit, the French Concession has never lifted the curfew since it was implemented in 1937. In addition, police patrols will be increased. The defense forces of various countries stationed in Shanghai will cooperate with the police. Special patrol teams and the Shanghai Volunteer Corps will also be prepared to be dispatched at any time from the 9th until the 14th. However, the Russian Company of the Volunteer Corps will patrol on foot and be stationed at various intersections of Avenue Edward VII.

### Léandre, Enthusiastic About Medicine, Receives Gold Medal, Awarded by French Ambassador Cosme

Dr. Léandre, Director of the Pasteur Institute in the French Concession of this city, has devoted himself to medical research with tireless efforts. Previously, typhus, a very dangerous disease for humanity, had no perfect preventive injection. If the drug was potent, it could produce immunity, but the reaction was quite dangerous. If the drug was weak, it could avoid danger, but it was not easy to be effective. He conducted extensive research and personally experimented, having been injected with

He also gave a brief account of Dr. Léandre's resume, stating that Dr. Léandre had served as an assistant at Marseille, then interned at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, and was subsequently sent to Guatemala in Central America to oversee health administration, work that is still praised by people in the Americas. Later, he returned to Marseille as a professor, and soon after was sent to India and then to Annam.

Brief Stay, Arrival in Shanghai

To head the French Concession Pasteur Institute. The Ambassador expressed his deep gratitude for his past work. Dr. Léandre then delivered a reply, expressing his unworthiness of the Ambassador's praise and his gratitude for the efforts and assistance of Consul General Orrent and the members of the Municipal Council. Mrs. Orrent then raised a glass of champagne to Dr. Léandre, who expressed his willingness to continue his research, hoping not to invent a vaccine, but to contribute a part of his strength.

### Gas Company Labor Dispute Approaching Resolution, Company May Be Flexible on the Issue of Dismissing Workers

The labor dispute at the British-owned Gas Company has shown signs of improvement since Chinese Director Yu Qiaqing of the Municipal Council intervened for a second time. The attitudes of both labor and management are gradually converging, and a satisfactory resolution is expected in the coming days. According to a reporter from the Pingming News Agency, Mr. Yu visited the company the day before yesterday to meet with Chairman Chadoury to mediate, and explained the workers' demands to Chadoury again. The company's attitude was more moderate than before, but it could not agree to stop hiring White Russian and Jewish workers, and insisted on dismissing some "unstable" workers. After Mr. Yu's explanation, the company authorities may be flexible on the issue of dismissing workers. They agreed to consider other demands and respond later. Mr. Yu then left and is scheduled to meet with Chadoury again today. At 11:00 a.m. yesterday, Mr. Yu reported to the workers' representatives on the progress of his talks with the company authorities, and advised the workers to maintain order and wait patiently for a response. The workers' representatives then relayed Mr. Yu's message to all the workers, who are now waiting patiently for Mr. Yu's reply.

When a reporter asked the Danish Consul General in Shanghai, who is also the Acting Senior Consul, Hill, about the progress of this appeal, he replied that he could not make any statement on the recommendations agreed upon by the Consular Body at its meeting last Friday, because other consuls had not authorized him to announce the decision. He also could not answer the question of when the Consular Body's reply would be delivered to the Municipal Council.

### White Russians Face More Trouble, Conflicts Arise Continuously, Ivanov to Assume Chairmanship of Association, Already Warned Not to Accept This Post

The English-language 大美晚報 (The China Press) reported that after Mr. Messer, Chairman of the White Russian Emigrant Committee in this city, was recently assassinated, the Japanese authorities and Fu Xiao'an proposed that the White Russian lawyer Ivanov succeed Mr. Messer as the chairman. At 7:00 p.m. last night (the 6th), Mr. Ivanov received a phone call at his apartment in the Breckling Apartments on Avenue Road.

Newspaper Owner Also Threatened

In addition, Mr. Chirikin, the publisher of the Russian-language daily newspaper in this city, also received a threatening phone call yesterday, threatening his life. It is believed that this was due to the newspaper's coverage of the Messer assassination case and its connection to a new White Russian group organized in Hongkou. After receiving the threat, Mr. Chirikin moved to the newspaper's office.

No Clues in Detective's Murder

At the same time, the French Concession Police Department continues to investigate the assassination of detective Yang Lao Fovski, but the motive for the case is still unknown. Also, the English-language 大美晚報 (The China Press) reported that after Mr. Chirikin, the publisher of the Russian-language daily newspaper in this city, received a threatening phone call yesterday (the 6th), the Municipal Council Police Department received a report and dispatched officers to guard the front of the Russian-language newspaper on Avenue Foch this morning (the 7th) to provide protection.

Undaunted, Continue the Struggle

A reporter from the Pingming News Agency visited the Russian-language newspaper on Avenue Foch yesterday morning and saw five or six Chinese and Indian police officers standing guard at the entrance, conducting strict inspections. He then spoke with staff members of the newspaper's editorial department, who confirmed that they had received threatening phone calls and other threatening notices.

### Investigation into the Bombing of Yongkang, Japanese Planes Bomb Yuyao for Days

The Ningbo Association in Shanghai yesterday continued to receive reports on the situation after the recovery of Zhenhai. The reports are recorded below. Ningbo issued three air raid alerts the day before yesterday. At 8:43 a.m., two Japanese planes were spotted over Qiancang. It was later learned that the two Japanese planes dropped 13 bombs on the urban area of Yongkang. The locations of the bombs were: one bomb in a certain location, two bombs near the prison, and one bomb on a certain bridge. A total of more than 100 houses were destroyed. Dozens of people were killed or injured. Because the bombs dropped by the Japanese planes were mixed with incendiary bombs, several houses in the city caught fire. At 9:06 a.m., the Japanese planes flew towards Shipu and left the sea. At 10:50 a.m. for the second time, three Japanese planes were spotted over Shengxian, flying east in formation. At 11:01 a.m., they appeared over Yuyao, circling back and forth. They then dropped one bomb near the restaurant, two bombs in a certain location in the eastern suburbs, and several bombs on Heming Bridge and Lijiawan. One bomb in front of the Qingchang Fish Market, due to flying shrapnel, injured two people. There were no other losses.

Yesterday's Situation

At 9:13 a.m. yesterday, one Japanese plane was spotted over Wenling. At the same time, two Japanese planes were spotted over Linghai. The Japanese planes spotted over Linghai passed through Hengshan, Songao, Xiangshan, and Shipu from south to southwest, and then dropped two bombs on Yongjia. The details are unknown. At 11:43 a.m., two Japanese planes were spotted over Wenling again. Ningbo immediately issued another emergency air raid alert. The two planes then passed over the northeast of Ningbo, Cixi from south to north, circling over Cixi for more than ten minutes, and then flew to Yuyao to wreak havoc again. Two bombs were dropped on Hemen Bridge, killing two innocent civilians. At 1:30 p.m., two Japanese planes were spotted over Songmen and left the sea.

Wenzhou Telegram

The Huanghua Village in Wenzhou and the Qitou Village on the north side of the Wenzhou port entrance were indeed indiscriminately bombarded by Japanese warships on the 5th of this month, and there were signs of an attempted landing. After the defending troops retaliated, they retreated. Also, inquiries were made to the Daitong and BeiDa telegraph companies on Avenue Edward VII last night. It was said that telegrams from Shanghai to Wenzhou were still being sent and received as usual, without any changes.

### Mail in the French Concession Continues to Be Inspected, Public Anxious About Delivery

Since the mail at the Masnan Road Post Office in the French Concession was suddenly inspected and detained in large quantities by Japanese inspectors starting on the 5th of this month, the inspectors have been carrying out this kind of inspection and detention work every day. At 8:30 a.m. yesterday morning, eight Japanese inspectors continued to arrive at the post office, and a large number of various types of mail were still selected and taken away for inspection. Registered express mail was also not exempt. However, after the Japanese inspectors finished the inspection, most of the mail that was deemed to be unrelated was returned, and there were few confiscations. However, the public cannot help but feel anxious about delivering mail within the French Concession, regarding it as a fearful undertaking.

### French Concession Rent Committee Discusses Fixed-Term Leases, Court Orders Eviction, Tenants Request Relief

The Chinese-speaking groups of the first and second teams of the French Concession Rent Investigation Committee held a second joint small group meeting at the French Concession Ratepayers' Association at 8:00 p.m. the day before yesterday. In addition to jointly discussing the opinions of Fu Dongju on the "malpractices of fixed-term leases and the impact on public security," there were no other discussions. Fu said that he rented No. 6, Lane 342, Avenue Road from the owner and had a fixed-term lease. Now that the term has expired, a lawsuit has been filed and a decision has been made to evict him. He said that the court's order for tenants to move out when the lease expires, although based on the law, does not take into account the situation in extraordinary times. The applicant's opinion is that after the Civil Code, the administrative authorities should formulate temporary relief measures, such as Chongqing and Hong Kong, which have temporary housing measures to adapt to extraordinary times. In addition, the housing relief section of the Land Law can also be used for reference. Tenants account for the majority of society, while owners are in the minority. Every time a lease expires, the owner uses the law to order eviction in order to collect tips and increase the rent. Over time, residents will be unable to withstand the pressure, which could lead to disputes and hinder social order, which will affect public security. The administrative authorities should take this into account and conduct joint research. It was immediately decided to submit the issue of relief for lease expirations to the next "General Assembly" for discussion. As for the impact on public security, it was requested that the General Assembly forward it to the Concession Administrative Authorities for special attention. It is reported that the French Concession will take into account both the law and human feelings when dealing with housing issues, and may formulate temporary relief measures, but there is no prospect of this yet.

They also distributed "Notice One," which stated that a "founding assembly" would be held next week at the former Shanghai Chamber of Commerce on North Henan Road. However, all the workers in the city are deeply aware of the righteousness of the situation. Since the union already has a legitimate organization and most of the workers have already joined, they all refused.

### Refugees From Chongming Talk About Atrocities, Confirm Thousands of Houses Destroyed, Number of Civilian Casualties Varies Widely

The North China Daily News reported that the Japanese soldiers on Chongming Island, angered by the attacks of the guerrillas, burned houses and massacred civilians on a large scale in retaliation. The residents of the island suffered a great disaster and fled to Shanghai. Shortly after 6:00 p.m. yesterday (the 6th), approximately 500 people arrived here, mostly women and children. Their relatives and friends in Shanghai gathered at the Bund on Avenue Edward VII to meet them. Many other Chongming refugees will also flee to Shanghai in the coming days. The refugees who arrived in Shanghai yesterday came on the Zhejiang Maru, carrying bundles and bags.

Hunger and Exhaustion

After disembarking and meeting with relatives and friends, they described in detail the terrifying scenes of their hometown, still with lingering fears. Many Chongming residents in Shanghai were also waiting on the Bund for their relatives and friends who had not arrived in Shanghai, and asked other refugees for news. A reporter spoke with the refugees and confirmed that the residents of Chongming had indeed suffered atrocities in the past few days. However, the number of civilians who were massacred varied widely among the refugees.

Varying Accounts

Some said they had witnessed the massacre of more than 100 civilian men in the Chenghuang Temple on the island. It is said that the Japanese soldiers summoned these men to the temple, pretending to hold a meeting, and the Japanese captain gave a speech. Unexpectedly, when they arrived at the temple, they were strafed by Japanese soldiers with machine guns. Those who were not killed were bayoneted to death. Other refugees said that they had seen several other groups of civilians who were also massacred. The number of people trapped in houses and buried in the flames was even greater. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the total number of civilians killed until detailed information is received.

As for the letters inquiring about relatives in France and Belgium through the International Red Cross, no reply has been received yet.

### Italian Merchant Ship Changde Sailed to Gutou Yesterday, Whether it Arrived Must Await Telegram, Small Ships Sailed to Cen Port, etc.

Since the Japanese Navy announced the blockade of Zhejiang and Fujian outer ports on the 16th of last month, the foreign ships sailing there have been suspended one after another. More than two weeks have passed, and there is no hope of resumption. However, the waters above the Sanjiangkou are still being cleared and sailed as usual. Today, the Shenyou ship is sailing. As for the rumors that foreign ships are requesting the consuls of their respective countries to negotiate with the Japanese authorities in order to maintain navigation rights, there may be some truth to it. However, since the Japanese Navy is using the excuse of military operations in the blocked ports, the hope of sailing is very slim. Recently, some small ships have sailed to Cen Port, Li Port, Songmen and other places outside Zhenhai Port. They are going to the interior of eastern Zhejiang, which is still separated by a sea surface. Whether they can achieve their purpose cannot be predicted yet. It must await the Changde's telegrams in the next few days. The customhouses at Cen Port, Li Port and Gutou, etc., do not have branch checkpoints. Ships sailing to the above-mentioned places are cleared with inland total (I.W.) clearance.

### "Cotton Yarn Exchange" Finally Dissolved

Last year, the Japanese side began preparing to establish a "cotton yarn exchange" in this city. However, due to the deep understanding and righteousness of the cotton yarn industry in Shanghai, they refused to cooperate, and it ultimately fell through. Around July this year, someone contacted the Japanese side, believing that the environment in Shanghai was special and that there was an opportunity to take advantage of it. They agreed to open the market on August 1 and named it "Cotton Yarn 引所". However, since its establishment, more than a week has passed and no one has come to the door, and there is no yarn to auction. As a result, the auction has not been completed. The Japanese side is deeply dissatisfied with this and it is rumored that the "Asia Development Board" has ordered it to be dissolved as soon as possible.

### Two Suspects Arrested in Wang Zhenji Kidnapping Case

According to what is known as of yesterday, in connection with the kidnapping of Wang Zhenji, an engineer from the United Electric Company, on July 11, the Japanese military police have arrested one Korean and one Taiwanese person related to the case.

### Continuous Heavy Rains and Abundant Precipitation: 24.8 Centimeters of Rain in Two Days, Yesterday's Rain Coincided with High Tide, Causing Street Flooding

This summer, the rainfall in this city has been extremely scarce. Although there were two rainfalls during the typhoon's passage through Shanghai, the weather turned clear immediately after the storm, and the rainfall was limited. However, at 5:30 PM the day before yesterday, lightning flashed, and heavy rain followed, lasting for over an hour. Due to the torrential rain, the drains on all the roads could not discharge the water in time, and water accumulated, forming channels, with depths exceeding half a foot in places.

Tidal Surge and Sudden Rain

Yesterday, at around 11:00 AM, it rained again, accompanied by thunder. The rain was torrential, lasting for over two hours before gradually easing. From 2:00 PM onwards, the rain stopped completely. During the period of heavy rain, due to the high tide in the Huangpu River, the water on the roads could not be discharged. The sewers were flooded with tidal water, further deepening the accumulation of water. Areas such as the Rising Sun Building on Nanjing Road were submerged in a vast expanse of water. Nearby areas such as Yinhua Street, Guangxi Road, Zhejiang Road, Jiujiang Road, as well as Gansu Road, Avenue Foch, Chengdu Road, Avenue Saussure, and the Bund, had water depths ranging from several points to half a foot, creating a sea of water. Vehicles splashed water as they passed, and pedestrians in neat attire had to use rickshaws to cross the roads.

Rainfall and Tide Levels

The reason why the accumulated water on the roads could not be discharged quickly was related to the high tide in the Huangpu River. According to observations, high tides in the Huangpu River began suddenly on the 3rd of this month, with levels around 10 feet. The water level in the Huangpu River rose sharply, and the accumulated water on the roads could not be discharged immediately. It had to wait for the tide to recede before it could be drained. It is expected that there will be high tides in the Huangpu River today and tomorrow, with levels also exceeding 11 feet. It will only return to normal after the 10th of this month. From the evening of the day before yesterday until 5:00 PM yesterday, the total rainfall was 24.8 centimeters. The sky remained overcast and gloomy throughout the day yesterday, with clouds billowing. Additionally, the wind had subsided, so the weather was not refreshing.

Typhoon Dissipated

The newly formed typhoon in the Pacific Ocean has been moving slowly for several days. After reaching 17 degrees north latitude and 134 degrees east longitude in the Pacific Ocean, it stalled. At 6:00 AM yesterday, the Xujiahui Observatory reported that the typhoon had dissipated, so the typhoon threat to this city has been lifted. There are no new typhoons forming in the Pacific Ocean.

### Nurse's Sudden Death Case, Prosecutor's Office Files Charges Yesterday, Failure to Report to the Police and Submit for Examination According to Regulations, Forging Evidence, Requesting Public Trial

Li Jieru, also known as Li Yuying, a female nurse from Fujian and head nurse at the Chinese-Western Sanatorium at 536 Shilu Road, died suddenly in the sanatorium on the night of June 10th. Due to the unclear cause of death, the prosecutor's office of the Second Special District ordered a coffin inspection. The details have been reported in this newspaper. It is now known that Zhao Changmin, the prosecutor of the prosecutor's office handling the case, formally submitted an indictment to the criminal court of the court yesterday.

Indictment

The indictment is transcribed as follows: Indictment of the Prosecutor of the First Special District Local Court of Jiangsu Shanghai. Defendant: Lu Zhenqing, male, 39 years old, from Beiping, Director of the Chinese-Western Sanatorium. Lin Zhengliang, male, 38 years old, from Ningbo, Physician of the Chinese-Western Sanatorium. The above defendants are involved in a case of forging evidence. After the investigation was completed, it was deemed that a prosecution should be initiated. The facts, reasons, and applicable laws are listed below. (Facts) Lu Zhenqing, the Director of the Chinese-Western Sanatorium at 536 Shilu Road, who is the first defendant in this case, opened the door to the room of Li Jieru, also known as Li Yuying, the head nurse of the sanatorium, with a key at 10:00 AM on June 11th this year. He entered the room with his nephew, who was already waiting in front of the door, and found her dead in bed. Subsequently, Lu Zhenqing told Li Konglan to go home and inform her grandparents, Li Shiling and Li Linshi. However, he did not report to the police and submit the body for examination according to regulations. Instead, he ordered Lin Zhengliang, the physician of the sanatorium, who is the second defendant in this case, to issue a death certificate stating that she died of a stroke. He moved the body to the Chinese Funeral Home and injected it with embalming fluid, intending to purchase land for burial. At this point, Lei Huayun reported the incident to this court and the French police, stating that Li Jieru died under unclear circumstances and requested an investigation to comfort the wronged soul. Based on this, the police sent investigators to investigate and ordered the coffin to be inspected. This court sent personnel to inspect the body, first examining the exterior and then performing an autopsy to examine the interior. They also took the undigested food from the stomach and intestines for analysis. The result determined that she died of acute heart failure. An autopsy report was filled out and attached to the file. After being questioned at the autopsy site, the defendants were considered to be suspected, and they were summoned to the sanatorium for further interrogation. (Reasons and applicable laws) It was found that Lu Zhenqing was a criminal suspect in the case of Li Jieru's death under unclear circumstances, which had been reported by someone and investigated by the police and this court. According to Lin Zhengliang, he did not know the cause of death but followed the instructions of the first defendant to forge a death certificate stating that she died of a stroke. Lu Zhenqing did not know the cause of death but did not report the death for examination according to regulations to clarify the truth. Instead, he instructed the second defendant to issue this certificate in order to send the body to the funeral home and bury it. All of this has been confessed multiple times and is supported by the death certificate attached to the file. Although Lu Zhenqing claimed that the deceased's father had asked him to issue a certificate for sending the body to the funeral home and that the second defendant was present at the time and could testify, Li Shizhen absolutely denied this, and Lin Zhengliang also said that he had not heard of it. Regardless of whether Lu Zhenqing intended to conceal other crimes, his actions clearly violated Article 29, Paragraph 1, and Article 165, Paragraph 1, of the Criminal Law. Lin Zhengliang's actions violated Article 165, Paragraph 1, of the same law. Therefore, in accordance with Article 230, Paragraph 1, of the Criminal Procedure Law, a prosecution is initiated and a public trial is requested. After receiving the indictment, the court held a hearing in the criminal court yesterday, presided over by Judge Zhu Chuzhe. The defendants Lu Zhenqing and Lin Zhengliang, accompanied by their defense attorneys Ling Changyan and Shan Yuhua, appeared in court. Prosecutor Zhao Changmin stated that the defendants had forged evidence, which had been verified as true, and requested that the court handle the case according to law. The court briefly questioned the two defendants and adjourned the hearing to August 21st. The defendants were released on their original bail.

### Hong Kong Unified Examination Papers to be Graded Locally, Grading to be Completed by Mid-Month

(Hong Kong Correspondence) The unified enrollment of national institutions of higher education last month had a total of 1,000 male and female applicants in the Hong Kong division, with more than 8,000 examination papers. The papers were originally scheduled to be sent to the Kunming Unified Examination Enrollment Committee for grading. However, according to information from the Hong Kong division enrollment office, the Ministry of Education has decided that due to inconvenient transportation between Hong Kong and Yunnan and difficulties in transporting the papers, sending them by air would require postage of more than 2,900 yuan. Therefore, it has been decided to hire local celebrities in Hong Kong to grade the papers. The Hong Kong office of the Unified Examination Enrollment Committee has hired 50 people, including Xu Dishan, Guan Zhaopeng, Zhang Lanzhou, Li Yin, and Hao Yixin, as paper grading committee members. It is reported that the grading will be completed by mid-month, and then the list of new students will be telegraphed to the Ministry of Education for approval and publication.

Relief Student Association Approves Pre-registration

Since its establishment last year, the Hong Kong Relief Student Committee has organized registration for relief for out-of-school students for thirteen sessions, providing assistance to 372 middle school and university students, with expenditures of 1,096 national currency and HK$0,933.46. Its work has been well received by the education community. The committee has now begun organizing the fourteenth session of registration for relief for out-of-school students. According to the person in charge of the committee, there are 1,072 applicants for the Kunming division in Hong Kong for the unified enrollment of national institutions of higher education. Based on last year's experience, many of these candidates will apply to the committee for registration. However, most of them apply for registration at the committee only after the results of the unified examination are released. After each registration deadline, a rigorous investigation is conducted to prove that the applicant's family is indeed poor, lacks travel expenses, and cannot afford to continue their studies before they can receive travel assistance. However, this year, due to transportation difficulties, new students who are admitted after the release of the unified examination results may be delayed on their journey to school and may not be able to arrive by the scheduled start date. Therefore, new regulations have been made, allowing all applicants for the unified examination to obtain application forms from the committee with their admission tickets and apply for pre-registration. After investigation, those who are deemed qualified to receive travel assistance can collect their travel expenses from the committee immediately after the release of the unified examination results and proceed to school, avoiding delays in their studies. This registration will close on the 10th of this month. Poor candidates can obtain registration forms and relief regulations from the following locations before the 10th of this month: (1) YWCA, Bonham Road; (2) YMCA, Bridges Street; (3) YMCA Branch, Kowloon; (4) Sheng Yi Book Society, Ice House Street.

Other works, such as research on the psychology of learning various subjects in primary and secondary schools, research on the connection between classical and vernacular Chinese, the development of psychological scales for identifying abnormal children, and the completion of intelligence and educational tests for primary and secondary schools, are also actively underway.

### Finance. Exceptionally High Foreign Exchange Settlement. Huge Amounts for Foreign Rice.

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no change in HSBC's listed rates. In the unofficial market for British and American currency, a slight easing appeared in the early morning, but it was fleeting, and tightening soon followed. Initially, American banks and others showed strong interest in supplying, and speculators also sold off slightly. Then, due to a high exchange rate of 2.25 points, numerous transactions of American dollars occurred at $5.75. Later, the China & South Sea Bank offered favorable rates, and Sassoon, a British firm, had a strong appetite for buying. It was also heard that settlement for imported foreign rice was substantial, with speculators returning to buy. At noon, HSBC also made purchases, pushing the market steadily softer until the afternoon closing. The closing rates were 3/71875 for British currency, 7/1875 for three-month bills, 0/9375 for American dollars, and $5.625. Daily trading saw less British currency and more American dollars.

After opening, American banks and others showed strong interest in supplying, and speculators also came to sell, lending strength to the market. It was recorded that American banks sold August American dollars to Sassoon at $5.75, and speculators also sold August American dollars to the China & South Sea Bank, also at $5.75.

### Hong Kong Currency Reaches $4.00. Citibank's Large $100 Notes Rejected by Some Dealers.

Demand for British currency notes was strong, pushing prices up by $0.30. Demand for American currency notes was exceptionally strong, reportedly due to some dealers refusing to accept large $100 notes, leading to a sudden shortage in circulation. As a result, the price temporarily rose to $17.90 in the afternoon, eventually settling slightly lower at $17.85, a gain of $0.43 compared to the previous day. The rise in Hong Kong currency was particularly strong, reaching $4.00 in the evening. Demand for Japanese currency notes remained strong, continuing to rise to $1.132 in the evening.

### Gold Market Plunges and Then Soars Again Due to Repeated Purchases by Hong Kong Banks

Yesterday's unofficial market for spot gold saw brisk trading and rising prices due to improved confidence. Prices surged from a low point, creating substantial buying pressure. The opening price was only $5,540, due to slightly firmer opening exchange rates. Although gold and silver firms bought and raised the price to $5,575, the upward trend soon stopped and even declined by $10. Subsequently, due to tightening exchange rates, Hong Kong banks aggressively bought, and selling disappeared from the market. Some smaller money changers reportedly sold, but the imbalance was significant, and prices jumped past the $5,600 mark. After reaching $5,630, prices fell slightly by several tens of dollars, but the final buying pressure, such as gold firms, continued unabated, raising the closing price to the highest point of $5,650, a gain of $70 compared to the previous day. The market remained strong after closing. It was reported that the largest off-market transaction reached $5,680. There was no market in the afternoon on Wednesday. Nearly 2,000 taels were traded in half a day. Jewelry shops increased the price of gold ornaments by $10. The Maritime Customs gold price remained flat.

Spot Gold Closes at a High Price

From the morning, with the exchange rate rising, American dollars hardening, and the initial selling pressure strong, the initial price for each bar (ten taels) was only $5,540, a decrease of $40 from yesterday's trading. Subsequently, with the support of buying by silver and gold firms, prices soon recovered by $35. Silver firms bought 50 taels from gold firms at $5,575. Soon, a short position trader from a money exchange increased their short position, causing prices to fall slightly to $5,565. Later, with the exchange market tightening, buying suddenly increased, and securities firms and silver firms competed to buy. Moreover, Hong Kong banks secretly purchased, and prices soon exceeded the $5,600 mark, followed by further buying from gold firms, continuing to rise by $30. Gold firms bought 30 taels from silver firms at $5,630. Unexpectedly, a securities firm suddenly decided to sell, releasing a significant amount, causing prices to fall back to the $5,600 level. However, buying resumed at noon, rising again. With gold firms and silver firms competing to buy, prices surged another $50, resulting in a closing price of $5,650, the highest price of the day, a gain of $70 compared to the previous evening's closing, with a fluctuation of $110 in half a day. The selling price for spot gold from the official brands of gold firms was several tens of dollars higher than the spot gold price, while the purchase price was $30 lower. The current margin was more than $50 lower than the listed price, with few transactions taking place.

Price of Gold Ornaments Increased by Ten Dollars

The initial selling price of gold jewelry per tael in major shops remained at $570. However, at 11:20 AM, the price increased by $10. There were no further changes after that. Major shops changed their listed price to $580. New shops had similar prices, with purchase prices reduced by about $30.

Exchange Rates Remain Stable

Yesterday's exchange rates for drafts and notes remained stable. The discount rate per thousand dollars remained unchanged throughout the day, with a purchase rate of $47 and a selling rate of $49, the same as the previous day. The interbank lending rate of the Money Traders Association remained unchanged at 1.7 points for both the morning and afternoon markets.

### Securities. Domestic Debt Makes Small Recovery

Yesterday's market for securities saw a slight recovery. This was a trend expected after several days of consecutive gains. If prices continue to fall slightly today, there will certainly be short covering. Yesterday morning and afternoon saw short covering. Purchases of the Ding-type stock of the 16th issue continued unabated. Other stocks, such as those of Tung Shun, Chiu Feng, Yan Chong, etc., were purchased throughout the day. Lian Yi also absorbed a significant amount in the morning. Lian He initially sold and then bought. Tong Kang and Xin Fu also made significant purchases. However, Yi Tai, De Fu, Xin Chong, Tong Xing, and the 35th issue experienced greater selling pressure, causing afternoon prices to fall slightly. Ding-type stock was the strongest, with investor confidence remaining stable. Short sellers covered on small dips, indicating that their position was not as strong as the long position. As a result of the day's trading, most prices recovered by 0.05 to 0.15, while Ding-type stock performed better, gaining 0.05. The total volume of transactions was estimated at over $800,000. A concise summary is provided below.

Stock Transactions: Five shares of the China Bookstore were traded at a price of $30.25 per share.

Additionally, the stock market at the General Chamber of Commerce yesterday was slightly sluggish, with weak trading and minimal price changes. Only new and old stocks of Jardine Matheson were very active, trending steadily upward in the morning without any decline. The prices of other stocks slightly increased at the beginning of the morning, but were immediately offset by selling pressure, with prices showing no difference from the opening.

London, 6th (Tuesday) dispatch: Today's listed market prices for Chinese foreign debt and Far East British companies' stocks showed little change. Only HSBC shares fell by £1 each, with British registered shares at £62 and Hong Kong registered shares at £65. The others showed no changes.

### Grains. Large Quantities of Foreign Rice Arriving. Market Rises After Initial Fall Yesterday.

The market for foreign rice, which had been showing a trend of initial tightening followed by fatigue for the past two days, reversed its previous behavior yesterday, showing a pattern of initial fatigue followed by consolidation. At the opening, both buyers and sellers were wary of the remaining momentum, and were hesitant to act. Clever speculators seized the opportunity to employ their usual tactic of "feigning retreat," releasing large quantities of rice onto the market, causing prices to fall steadily. By midday, prices had fallen by nearly one dollar, with No. 1 old Saigon at only $57.50 to $57.00, No. 2 at $51.50, fired broken rice at $56.50, and small broken rice at $52. At this moment, speculators recognized that the time was right and abruptly changed their strategy, turning from selling to buying, and bids rose continuously. As a result, the overall situation changed dramatically, becoming exceptionally active, with prices steadily recovering. Ultimately, the total trading for the day, after one fall and one rise, recovered to the original level, similar to the previous closing price. Yesterday, buyers from Shantou inquired about various grades of rice, with No. 2 Saigon offered at $62.50 and No. 2 Siam at $61.50 to $62.50, both higher by $0.50 compared to the previous day. The transit rice of No. 2 Siam, which had not been reported for import, was absorbed by Shantou buyers, with prices rising to $62.80 and $63.00, a larger increase of $1 compared to the previous day. A total of 7,000 bags of spot rice were offered, while there were 400 to 500 tons of original bags returning to the market.

There were rumors that the trading of japonica and glutinous domestic rice in the unofficial market was similarly balanced in terms of supply and demand, with stable prices and no changes. Changbang rice was offered at $68.50 to $68.00, Nangang early rice original bags at $64.00 to $65.00, and bulk rice at $61.50, $61.00, and Jinli special rice at $61.00 to $62.00.

Due to scant arrivals of Zhou oil new japonica rice, only seven shi (石) were listed, and prices continued to rise by $0.50 due to rain. The opening price was $63.

Yesterday, 1,388 bags of foreign rice arrived in Shanghai, shipped from Hong Kong on the Tai Gu Company's Qiongzhou ship, docking at the company's wharf in Pudong for unloading. It is reported that a large quantity of foreign rice will arrive in Shanghai this week. The Hua Lun Ge Lan ship is carrying rice from Siam to Shanghai and is expected to arrive today.

### Northern Merchants Purchase By-products

Flour: Trading was slightly more active yesterday. In addition to the daily needs of local retail sales, sales to customers also gradually increased. It is said that the routes to the north, which had been quiet for a long time, have improved recently due to increased local demand, so telegrams were sent to purchase Shanghai flour, with by-product flour being even more sought after due to its lower price. Some merchants from the south also dabbled in it, causing the market to strengthen somewhat. The selling price for No. 2 brand and Fortress Double Eagle brand foreign flour was $16, with 4,000 to 5,000 bags traded. Domestic flour remained at $15, with limited supply. The Phoenix brand flour from Japanese factories initially fell but then tightened, with September flour opening at $13.80 and then recovering to $14. The market for other miscellaneous brands of flour remained stable.

Wheat: There were no special developments in the market yesterday. Sellers mostly waited for opportunities to unload their goods. Japanese and Chinese factories did not lower prices to attract buyers. Therefore, apart from scattered deliveries to factories, there were no new large-scale transactions.

### Yarn and Cotton. Weak Spot Sales Make it Difficult for Yarn Prices to Rise.

The yarn market has entered a period of fluctuation again. However, due to the continued weakness of foreign exchange rates, investor sentiment has not improved, mainly because spot sales of yarn are not smooth, making it difficult for speculators to be very enthusiastic. However, its trajectory is relatively stable, and it is feared that there will not be major changes. The fundamental problem is that sales are too slow. The current situation is to sell slightly when prices rise and buy when prices fall, which is more economical.

The opening of the spot yarn market in the morning was weak. Because exchange rates eased on the afternoon of the 10th, some long positions were sold off, and snatchers took advantage of the situation to push down prices. At the opening, the price of 10-count Double Horse yarn was $1,005. Few sellers offered at this price, and the market gradually improved again. It was later heard that exchange rates had tightened and gold had become expensive, and buying sentiment increased, gradually rising to $1,015. However, it declined again after the close. According to statistics, 1,905 bales were traded in half a day. The price of 20-count Double Horse yarn fell by $2.50. Yesterday, 637 bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Yantai, and 705 bales were shipped to Hong Kong. Another 625 bales will also be shipped to Hong Kong today. The amount of purchases made by each group is listed as follows:

Hong Kong: 1,700, Industry: 1,420

Mainland: 200, Yunnan: 100

Xiamen: 15, Total: 1,905

### Textile Factories Become Active One After Another. Cotton Market Sees Great Development and Prices Also Improve Significantly.

The cotton market, which has been quiet for a long time, saw exchange rates contract yesterday, and trading among industry members became active again. At the same time, factories, due to the stability of yarn prices and not having purchased for a long time, also had the idea of replenishing their inventories. As a result, spot cotton trading saw great development, and prices improved accordingly. However, the situation in the overseas Indian and American cotton markets remained sluggish. Today, 100 bales of cotton will be shipped to Hong Kong. The details of the spot cotton transactions are listed on the left:

White Luo to: 204.00 Xinyu Progress: 200 bales

Brazilian Cotton

229.50 Japan China Progress 1,500 bales

Durilla: 100.00 Also: 200 bales

Dazhongji: 30.50 Xinyu Progress 1,500 bales

General Bundled: 186.00 Also: 300 bales

Xinxiang: 190.00 Shenxin Progress: 100 bales

Fine Velvet Package: 207.00 Also: 200 bales

Pengjiapu: 226.50 Also: 100 bales

Fire Machine Grass: Fire Machine 159.00 Dakang Progress: 200 bales

General Bundled: 181.50 Also: 200 bales

NT 226.00 Japan China Progress: 300 bales

The above factory transactions are all spot deliveries to factories

Fire Grass Package: 152.00 Thirty-one Progress: 67 bales

Fire Bundled: 159.00 Also thirty bales

Tongzhou: 20.00 Also: 14 bales

Pingguoer: 138.00 Also 100 bales

Tongzhou 168.50 Yuan Cheng Progress 107 bales

General Bundled: 171.50 Thirty-one Progress 230 bales

Miterlin: 40.00 Industry Progress 100 bales

Fire Machine: 185.00 Also: 130 bales

The above industry transactions are all stock deliveries

Another news report stated that New York cotton prices were weak, with very quiet spot trading. Wall Street stocks were weak, and the closing price fell by three pounds compared to the previous day. Indian prices, including forecasts, rose by over one rupee.

Spot cotton trading in Shanghai was quite lively yesterday, but all were silver futures transactions by Japanese manufacturers, numbering over a thousand bales. However, trading on the Chinese side remained exceptionally quiet.

### Piece Goods: Textile Factories Resume Work, Focusing on Foreign Exchange for Advances and Retreats, Not Emphasizing Supply and Demand

Domestic Cloth: The market rose after an initial fall yesterday, and the situation was stable. After a slight improvement in cloth sales, textile factories that had stopped work gradually decided to resume. However, actual sales remained mediocre. Stockpilers focused on foreign exchange rates for their advances and retreats, neglecting the state of supply and demand. Selling prices still fluctuated between $0.25 and $0.50, and the results were almost the same as the previous day. Customer sales were normal. Merchants from eastern Zhejiang purchased over 100 pieces of coarse cloth and colored cloth. Merchants from Fujian and Guangdong purchased 110 pieces of colored cloth and colored twill. Merchants from Yantai purchased nearly 100 pieces of coarse cloth and melton. Retailers in the local area purchased over 200 pieces, with purchases declining. In the afternoon, dye factories absorbed over 300 pieces of raw cloth.

Dongbu Cloth: The market for Longtou fine white cloth was soft in the morning. Then, due to the firm investor sentiment and continued purchases by fellow traders, it rose to $32.15 by noon. Later, merchants from Tianjin and Yantai purchased 300 bales of Longtou cloth, gradually pushing up the market, with sales reaching $32.75. However, it fell back slightly at the close, with Longtou fine cloth at $32.65, Four Gentlemen beaverteen at $0.94, and mid-grade fine cloth and fine twill generally stable.

Exports: Yesterday, 598 pieces of cotton cloth were shipped to Yantai, 315 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong, and 4 pieces were shipped to Tianjin. Today (August 8), 400 pieces will be shipped to Hong Kong.

### Sales of Woolen Fabrics Limited

Demand for woolen fabrics from customer groups has been lacking recently. Merchants from inland regions are unable to continue their business due to transportation disruptions, exchange rate issues, and the need to pay 75% tax. Most of the occupied areas are controlled by Japanese merchants. Cargo transportation to North China has mostly stopped, and trade is conducted through bartering in Nanjing. As a result, sales of woolen fabrics to customer groups of all sizes in the inland and occupied areas have been restricted. When Shanghai-Ningbo ships were operating, merchants were still able to find ways to do business. However, now that the ships have stopped, the scope of sales has narrowed, and sales of woolen fabrics will depend entirely on the isolated concessions of Muji Street.

### Silk and Tea. Silk Sales Quiet.

The New York silk market has been flat and weak, with very little trading. The exchange has been trading only ten bales a day for several days, which is unprecedentedly quiet. Therefore, this has affected silk prices in Japan. For the past twenty days, Yokohama silk prices have been at 1,350 yuan for spot, with no rise or fall for over half a month. This is because the Japanese government has allocated funds to maintain silk prices. Therefore, there is little hope for price increases in the future. The local silk market was affected by the decline in exchange rates. British and French firms were becoming active. White factory grade 78 was at 4,885 yuan, grade 81 was at 4,950 yuan, and grade 83 was at 5,050 yuan, with only 50 dan (担) traded. However, the prices for the trading firms were 200 to 300 yuan higher than the Japanese firms. Yesterday, 208 pieces of tea were shipped to Hong Kong and 1,125 pieces were shipped to Tianjin.

### Miscellaneous Grains. New Oxhide Soybeans and Yellow Soybeans Appear. Procurement and Transportation Permits are Very Expensive.

In addition to the soybeans from Jiujiang, the earliest to appear on the market are the oxhide soybeans from Changzhou. It is said that these soybeans have been available in the production area for two weeks, but have not been shipped to Shanghai because the cost of procurement and transportation permits is too high. Yesterday, small samples of these soybeans were seen in the market. The quality of these soybeans is excellent this year due to the dry weather, and the harvest is also abundant. The cost in the production area is 34-35 yuan (calculated per 160 market catties), and the cost of transportation to Shanghai, including hemp bags, is about 32-33 yuan per dan. Therefore, merchants are unsure about the external costs and are temporarily hesitant to transport them. The market for old soybeans was slightly soft yesterday, with thin trading. There were only 50 bags of Wuhu soybeans traded in the local area, with prices listed in the market price column, as well as over 40 bags of Chongming sand yellow soybeans and 20 bags of Dalian mixed green soybeans.

Also, 155 bags of soybeans were shipped to Hong Kong today, and 1,745 tins of raw oil were also shipped to Hong Kong.

### Sugar Market. Supply Falls Short of Demand and Prices Continue to Rise.

Yesterday, the sugar market rose from flat to higher as the value of the American dollar contracted by 0.09375 and supply fell short of demand, resulting in increases ranging from several cents to one dollar. The price of No. 24 coarse white sugar was $70.05 per bag for sugar stored locally and $71.00 in the afternoon. The price of foreign-stored sugar was $70.00, $70.05, and $71.00. The price of transshipped sugar with a release date of August 15 was $55.30, and with a release date of August 22 was $55.55. Tai Gu brand B was $73.00, $73.20, and $73.50. DY brand was $70.04 for the Dong stockyard and $69.70 for the HX West stockyard. Dutch cotton white sugar was $71.00, Dutch red sugar was $57.00 and $57.50. The price of white sugar from local factories was $70.05 to $71.00.

Yesterday, 2,400 tons of sugar arrived from Holland, and 766 bags and 359 cases arrived from Haikou.

### Coal. Coal Balls Continue to Increase by Eight Yuan, at $7.20 Per Dan.

Coal ball prices were raised by the manufacturer's guild yesterday by 8 yuan due to tightening exchange rates and rising costs. The list prices for Nanyang Yitai Xingguo Hua coal balls were 132 yuan per ton from the factory, with additional charges for delivery. Street vendors sold them for $7.20 per dan (100 market catties), an increase of four cents compared to the previous week.

### Miscellaneous. Candle Sales Sluggish Due to Hot Weather.

The candle market situation, due to foreign exchange, high raw material costs, led to price increases, resulting in the industry all stockpiling supplies. Due to weather conditions, sales have been sluggish. Market inventories for candles are full, making it difficult to sell for the moment. The latest prices are $18 without a pass for Ship Brand, $17.60 for Chicken Brand, and $16 for other miscellaneous brands. Sales are weak, and a turnaround is expected after the Mid-Autumn Festival.

### North-South Goods. Longkou Vermicelli Rebounds by Fifteen Yuan.

Vermicelli: Previously, the price of Longkou vermicelli had fallen from over $110 to $100 due to slow sales. Recently, the three firms specializing in this product have formed an alliance and stopped offering discounts, so the price has immediately tightened, rising to $115. The price of Qingdao vermicelli has also risen by $1 to $81.

### Hardware. Iron Products Hindered by Rain.

Yesterday's torrential rain severely affected hardware transactions. Various iron products could not be shipped out, and the market was depressed. 200-pound U.S. steel wire was still priced at $160. 180-pound U.S. tinplate was still selling for $240, and 200-pound was priced at $260. Bamboo steel bars were priced at $1,150 per ton. Local steel nails were priced at $45. New plated nails were priced at $45. New zinc wire was priced at $85, and white zinc wire was priced at $70. Black iron sheets were priced at around $75. The price of billet goods was about $1,000 per 2,000 pounds. The price of American strip iron was between $130 and $140 per case, with prices but no sales.

Steel arrived in Shanghai from the U.S. on the Tampa, a ship from the U.S. Corporation managed, that arrived at the Hongshun Wharf, Hongkou last Saturday. There were a total of 5,000 tons of steel bars, steel plates, iron ingots, and galvanized iron. It is reported that a large quantity will arrive in Shanghai today.

Also, 866 blocks of angle iron arrived from Hong Kong yesterday.

### Pudong Riverside Rumors

According to people on ships anchored in the Huangpu River in the Nanshi area of Shanghai, recently, from 11:00 PM every night, there is a sudden uproar and shouts, lasting until dawn, sometimes twice or three times, even with gunshots to add to the chaos. The reason for this is said to be that people on the ships see a ball of dark air coming with the wind, like a collapsing Mount Tai, sweeping away those sleeping soundly on the ships. Some say that three people were swept away from a certain ship, and others say two people were swept away from another ship, but no actual names can be identified. As a result, people are panicking and cannot sleep peacefully. The merchants and residents in the Nanshi area are all spreading these rumors, but wise people do not dare to believe them lightly.

Ancient Artifact Unearthed

Reprinted from Xin Bao Sixty-Seven Years Ago (469)

(See this newspaper from the 12th year of the Tongzhi reign of the Qing dynasty)

Westerners greatly value ancient artifacts, and the cultural relics of Rome and Greece are said to predate those of other countries. Now, many ancient objects have been unearthed in that region, which people greatly treasure! Recently, it was heard that someone unearthed a bottle in Yesselik, with ancient characters on it that no one recognized. Li Fengbao, the observer of the Chinese mission to Germany, said that these were Chinese characters, and the year recorded was 3,000 years ago, stating that the bottle could contain three bolts of gauze. The Westerners were very happy, saying that ancient Greece and Rome had dealings with China in the past, and this bottle was purchased from China. However, some people suspect that this bottle was not transported from China, and wonder how the differences between Chinese and Western characters at that time can be known. The statement also makes sense.

### How Will the New World Arrive?

Last time in this newspaper, we mentioned "We need a new world." We also said that the realization of this new world requires everyone to have a thorough understanding of sin and evil, and a determination to eliminate evil completely.

First, let's talk about how humanity can have a thorough understanding of sin and evil. Actually, this is not a problem. Because Mencius once said, "The heart of right and wrong is in everyone." If people have a sense of right and wrong, they will naturally know what is good and what is evil, what is in accordance with heavenly principles, and what is inhumane. What is there to realize or not realize? Unfortunately, people, for various reasons, such as pride, selfishness, or prejudice, often bury their conscience, shamelessly, harden their hearts, stubbornly refuse to repent, and act willfully. They completely disregard how much harm their words or actions will cause to others. If there are such people in a family, that family will not be peaceful. If there are such people in power in a country, not only will that country not be peaceful, but it will also harm other countries. When will humanity be able to accept the guidance of the conscience that God has given them, reform themselves, and become new people? That is when the new world will arrive.

Secondly, we should know that humans have weaknesses. Sometimes, when examining their conscience at night, they may have an understanding of sin, but they do not have the ability to overcome sin. For example, if you talk to a person who smokes opium about the harms of opium, they probably know more than you do. But as soon as you mention the words "abstain from it," they will "talk about other things." Why is this? This is human weakness! A saint in Christianity once lamented his own weakness, saying, "For to will is present with me, but how to perform that which is good I find not." (Romans 7:18) Later, at another time, he said, "I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me." (Philippians 4:13) Dear readers, if we want humanity to become new, if we want the world to become new, we must start with ourselves. Only Jesus can give you new strength. Do you believe?

### The Cave Hospital

— Weng Qiao

The twenty-three caves outside Xi'an, Shaanxi, are the newest type of hospital in this city. These caves are located in the square behind a Taoist temple, where neat grass and shrubs grown from root division provide the hospital with a lovely garden. Moreover, the thirty-foot-deep caves provide maximum safety for patients and equipment during bombing.

The Northwest Hospital, established by the Northwest Special Health Committee of the National Health Administration, certainly has its reasons for being cautious. Xi'an is only one hundred and sixty kilometers from the Yellow River front line, and it has been visited by Japanese planes several times. During the bombings in March, the Yanqing and Labosun Hospital, a church institution with a long history in the capital of Shaanxi Province, was bombed twice. As a result, the operating room and clinical professorship were destroyed. Later, the hospital moved to a church school outside the city, and the hospital was located in the caves to avoid suffering the same fate again.

The hospital has an annual budget of 130,000 yuan. It has an outpatient department and thirteen wards in Xi'an, all of which are in caves. The wards have one hundred beds, and another ten caves are used as clinical professorships and staff dormitories. New wards can be built in a short period of time when needed.

The hospital is divided into six departments: internal medicine, surgery, ophthalmology, otolaryngology, pediatrics, and obstetrics. There are twenty-one certified doctors here, some of whom have studied in the United States or the United Kingdom. In addition, there are thirty-four trained nurses.

The hospital began serving the community in September 1939. In the first three and a half months, a total of 14,989 patients were treated. Since this year, the outpatient department has had a total of 500 patients every day.

In the hospital, patients are completely free of charge. The only cost is the two-mao storage fee for the medicine bottle. The wards in the caves are very dry and have good ventilation. If the weather permits, patients can also go to the garden to enjoy more sunshine and the beauty of nature.

The operating room is located in the main hall of the temple. Most of the patients who come to the hospital for surgery are trachoma patients.

The hospital focuses its attention entirely on civilians, because there are many military hospitals near Xi'an that care for wounded soldiers.

Nature

### The Island's Spouse

— Hu

I happened to see such a record in a magazine:

In the Guiana region, there is a bird called Tinamau. After the female lays an egg, she flies far away, leaving the responsibility of hatching the egg to the male. Often, before the first chick's feathers are strong, the female flies back from afar and lays another egg, forcing the father to shoulder the dual responsibility of hatching eggs and raising children, while the mother soars in the wilderness, living a leisurely life.

Conversely, in Europe, there is a bird called Hornbill. After the female lays an egg, she is imprisoned in a mud-built nest, leaving only a very small hole to receive food given by the male bird; she has no freedom at all.

This is what I wrote down based on my memory. The original text is certainly somewhat different from this, but I am confident that the content is not distorted. As for why I can remember it so clearly, it is because I felt that these two extremely different birds seem to contain a bit of educational meaning for us humans. Therefore, I also told this record to my friends, which aroused a lot of discussion among them.

In feudal society, the status of women has always been low. They are indeed like being "imprisoned" in houses by men; except for managing household affairs, there is no social interaction at all. However, since the eastward spread of European customs, some women have not only been liberated, but their status has even surpassed that of men, leaving all family responsibilities to their husbands, while they specialize in dancing, watching movies, and even having affairs with others. Just like the Tinamau mentioned earlier, they specialize in wandering outside, and the eggs jointly conceived with other birds must also be hatched and raised by their husbands. These phenomena all have the drawbacks of excess and inadequacy.

The most ideal couple should be on a position of mutual assistance, neither like Hornbill, which particularly restricts women's activities, nor like Tinamau, which completely entrusts responsibility to men. They should be like swallows, each doing their best and each taking on their responsibilities with their own strengths.

### Freedom

— Sen Nian

What is freedom? It includes two points: (1) Understand the scope of your actions and abide by them. You must acknowledge that you have an independent personality and do not be afraid, jealous, or disgusted. (2) You must understand the environment in which you are located and do not be afraid, jealous, or disgusted. When you do this, you will gain freedom. ——Ann Bridge

Hawthorne's Investigation

### The Dancer's End

— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter Four Several Guesses

The tea waiter smiled again, half pushing and half accepting, and said, "Sir, you are too polite." In fact, the legal tender had already safely passed. "Sir, what exactly did this Mr. Qian do?"

Hawthorne said in a low voice, "He may have killed someone!" As he spoke, he paused, as if listening to something, and looked towards the west entrance of the aisle.

"Killed someone?" The attendant could not help but reveal a look of horror.

Hawthorne stopped him and said, "Keep your voice down! You can inform your colleagues that if they see him again somewhere, or if someone comes looking for him, you should send someone to follow them quietly. If you can report to me the address of him or his friend, I am prepared to reward you with ten similar legal tenders." As he spoke, he took out a card and gave it to him. "Here is my phone number, keep it."

When the tea waiter saw the card, a look of surprise suddenly appeared on his face. "Oh, you are Mr. Hawthorne—I—I will definitely do it—but it may not be easy to see him again."

Leisang nodded and said, "That doesn't matter, I have other ways to find him. Just do your best." After he finished speaking, he nodded to me, turned around and left.

I followed Hawthorne back to the front of the elevator room. The steel door of the elevator room was closed, and the indicator needle above was stopped on the first floor downstairs. I expected that it would take a considerable amount of time for this elevator to rise to the top and then descend again. Because of the gradual development of this case, I was really a little impatient, so I wanted to take advantage of this waiting opportunity to hear Hawthorne's views. (69)

Essay

### The Soul's Cry

— Pin Pin

A person walking on the road of life often has to look back. Almost every step forward, they have to look back once. There is nothing particularly unforgettable in the past, but as they get closer to old age day by day, the disappearance of youth naturally causes melancholy, so they feel more and more that the past is lovely.

I can say that I am almost halfway through my life. I walk slower, my memory gradually fades, my hair is not as thick as it used to be, my eyes rarely flash with brilliance, and my conversation is as ordinary as others. I feel lonely because my close young friends are alienated from me, and I am replaced by a group of strangers without light and heat. I am wandering, and the road ahead seems to be blocked. I ask myself, "Is my life over like this, like a cicada at the end of summer?"

When I am moving, I can forget myself, but when I am quiet—for example, in the early morning when I wake up early, or during a rest after work—I can't help but question myself, "I have lost something!" I ponder, and ponder again, and finally discover what this lost thing is. The ambition of youth is lost!

In the past, I made hundreds of vows, participated in activities that were not too many or too few, competed with people for a countless number of times, and argued with my opponents until my mouth was dry. I laughed often... What about now? I don't make vows, like a stupid cow, I retreat, like an old horse, I retreat, I don't like competition, saying it has no meaning, I don't know where the ability to argue has escaped to; as for laughing, I have also lost its method, I only have sorrow.

I, who have lost my ambition, am very panicked, like a magpie being chased by a falcon.

The ambition of youth is necessary. Even if it brings errors or failures, if there is no ambition of youth, life is like winter. Although the efforts of my youth did not bring joy to me, I have no right to seek joy without them. What can I do now except look back?

Suddenly, the soul said to me, "Resurrect it! Preserve it!" I feel a burst of energy after hearing the soul's cry. People who are on the same road with me, you don't have to panic, there is still a spark of youthful ambition, just waiting to be fanned!

Historical Materials of the Pear Garden

### About Tan Xinpei's Poems

— Plum Blossom Pavilion Master

When Liang Rengong of the Ice-Drinking Studio lived in the old capital, he often interacted with people in the pear garden. He once wrote a poem on Tan Xinpei's embroidered portrait of a fisherman, which was widely recited by people in the capital at that time. When I first went to Ping in the autumn of the ninth year of the Republic of China, I saw this portrait and this poem, which were hung in the west side room of Yingxiutang. There was also a postscript by Luo Yinggong after the poem. When I went again later, I never saw this portrait again. The poem is a seven-character ancient poem, and I have a copy of it. The poem says: "Tan Xinpei is the only one in the world, his fame has thundered for thirty years. Now he is old and playing with the world, and he still has a handsome appearance to blow away the dust; the rain of art and the wind of reeds are rushing in the evening, and he entrusts his smoky hat to the depths of the Five Lakes. How many people in the world trade embroidery, wasting their songs and tears in the arena."

My family's Sea Collection Building Master Taiyi also liked to travel with actors in middle age. Among the poems given to actors, the most were obtained by Jin Yuemei, the master of Shuangqing Pavilion. Wang Lingzhu and Zhou Xinfang also gained quite a lot, but none of them were included in the collection. Among the ones occasionally seen in the collection, there is a seven-character poem given to Tan Yingxiu, entitled "Watching Little Jiao Tian Perform Peng Bei," which is quite sonorous and worth reciting. It cannot be abandoned because of the person, so it is recorded together.

"Yang Ye in his old age actually surrendered with his corpse, the fame of Yun Dai has been around for a while; what is the difference between breaking the enemy and chasing pheasants and rabbits? He once said to avoid banners when he saw the wind; late in life, he became an old relic of the Imperial Academy, and the dying hero has a handsome appearance; the frost and moon are full of dog ice and tears, and the dark wailing still surrounds the Li Ling Stele."

According to the intention of this poem, the focus is on the plot. The fifth and sixth sentences, "Late in life, he became an old relic of the Imperial Academy, and the dying hero has a handsome appearance," one writes about the status of the performer in the actor world, and the other writes about the attitude of the character on the stage; the last two sentences write about the wonderful sound and emotion of this play and the skill of the performance, combining the performer and the character in the play into one, which is enough to show Tan's in-depth transformation of imitating Yang Ye's voice and appearance.

A few days ago, I read an article entitled "Separate Records of the Pear Garden" written by the famous writer Yu Yuan, an old man from Xijin. It contains many poems about famous actors and plays during the Tongguang period. One of them is a poem about Tan's Zhuangyuan Genealogy, which says:

Ode to Tan Jinfu (i.e., Little Jiao Tian)

Zhuangyuan Genealogy (Anonymous)

"The knees are withered and desolate, and the declining years are often worried. I sigh that the descendants of the industry are lost, and I sigh that I was not born at the right time. I beg for the appearance of a quail, and sing about the ordinary with leisure. I patrol the eaves and cry, and I raise my staff and fill my chest with anger. Looking back to the other shore is urgent, and the ancestral grave is full of thick tears. I offer thin enjoyment to commemorate the time, and the relics are in Chongfeng. I return the wealth to the palm of my hand, and I must follow the teachings. One morning, I moved to the good quickly, and the eagle road flew into the sky." (Mei's note: This is a poem about the play, and it has nothing to do with Yingxiu.)

The original note says: Tan Jinfu's stage name is Xinpei. His father sang old female roles, and his voice was like the Jiao Tianzi bird, so he was nicknamed "Jiao Tianzi." Yingxiu's nickname is "Little Jiao Tian" for this reason. When Yingxiu was old, those who called him that could not bear to say "Little," so they simply said "Jiao Tian'er." Jinfu was his alias at a certain period.

### Germany's Film Blitzkrieg Tactics

— Hua Zhi

The German army captured the small countries of Europe by means of lightning speed, and the world was shocked by her "blitzkrieg tactics." However, Germany's lightning method is not only in military affairs, but also in cultural films.

Originally, American films occupied a large market in various small European countries, and the German film industry had long regarded it as a thorn in its side. However, it had no way to compete with it, so it tried its best to endure and wait for a good opportunity. A few months ago, when the German army attacked Denmark and entered Copenhagen, the capital of Denmark, on the very night, it immediately issued an order that all the cinemas in the city should show German-produced films to celebrate. The owners of the cinemas were all very panicked, because they only had American films on hand. Where did the German films come from?

At this moment, many German film merchants suddenly appeared with smiles on their faces. They brought a large number of newly made German copies and distributed them to various cinemas one by one. The owners were very surprised. In fact, the day before the German army entered Copenhagen, the German "film fifth column" had already received the news that Copenhagen would fall at a certain time, and they had brought a large number of films into the city in advance to make arrangements calmly. When the order was given, they would control everything. This method was also used once when they occupied Czechoslovakia. What is pitiful is that American films were banished from Denmark overnight, and the stars most loved by Danish young men and women, such as Clara Gable, Elol Flynn, and Diana Bo Ping, also said goodbye to them from then on, and their eyes were replaced by a group of unfamiliar faces that were not very welcome.

### How to Make a Movie? (7)

— De Gang

(7) When watching a silent film with sound, you can only see people's lips moving, but you can't hear what they are saying. This is of course a big regret. In order to eliminate this regret, scientists invented sound films, bringing sound to the screen so that audiences can not only see, but also hear. The method of making sound films is to record various sounds, such as light words, music, singing, etc., together with the phonograph when filming, and then use a loudspeaker to release the recorded sound when showing the film. There is a difficulty here, which is that it is difficult to make the action and sound happen at the same time. In order to solve this difficulty, someone invented the use of two electric small motors, one for the film and one for the sound. Both motors are specially installed to make the action consistent, so that the film and sound can be emitted at the same time, and there will never be any discrepancies. In addition, there is also a latest type of sound film, the film of the image, which also has sound traces for sound emission at the same time. The color of the sound traces varies in intensity, which is exactly in line with the sound. When projecting, strong light passes through the sound traces and reaches an electric eye. Because the light has intensity, the electric eye generates electric waves, which then act on the loudspeaker, and the sound is emitted. The principle of this sound film is relatively complicated and cannot be described in detail in this article. ()
