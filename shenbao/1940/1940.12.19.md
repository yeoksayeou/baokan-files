### President Roosevelt Formally Announces US to Prepare to Expand Aid; Draft Plan Readied to Present to Congress for Supplying Large Quantities of War Material to Britain

Washington – President Roosevelt declared yesterday that the US government is currently considering manufacturing even greater quantities of military equipment for loan to Britain. The President stated, "Britain's resistance is, in fact, the best defense for the United States. Therefore, it is better to give US military equipment to Britain for their use than to store it in the US; its effect will be more substantial." When a reporter inquired about Secretary of State Hull's statement that "the first half of 1941 will be the most dangerous period for Britain," President Roosevelt only stated that the government would make continuous efforts to accelerate its large-scale military equipment manufacturing plan. At the same time, it would also awaken the efforts of the populace. There are currently two or three instances where factories manufacturing defense products are not fully cooperating with the government, so the government is studying whether to take over those factories. However, the President stated that, under the current circumstances, there is no need to declare a national emergency, only to see if the country can accelerate military equipment production.

Washington – President Roosevelt, yesterday, outlined to reporters his plan for leasing war materials to Britain, saying that this plan would both aid Britain and strengthen US defenses. He plans to present it to the new Congress on January 3rd. According to this plan, the US can take over Britain's future orders for war materials in the US, and then lease the manufactured goods to Britain when the orders are completed. After the war ends, if the borrowed war materials are still intact, Britain will return them to the US; otherwise, they will compensate for them. A reporter asked if this approach would easily draw the US into the war. The President replied that this would definitely not happen. The President also stated that this plan is still being studied from a legal point of view. Whether the ownership of the planes, cannons, and ships transported to Britain should remain with the US or be temporarily transferred to Britain is a legal challenge, but this is only a minor matter inevitable in the US's major aid plan for Britain. The entire matter will be handled on the basis that the US must aid Britain in its fight for self-defense. As for the issue of accelerating domestic production, Britain's orders for war materials are a good tool to promote the necessary expansion of US production. The plan he is proposing is the newest stage in the process of aiding Britain short of entering the war. Although legislation is necessary, it will not involve amendments or repeals of the Neutrality Act. There has recently been considerable discussion about providing financial aid to Britain. As far as humanity knows, the outcome of major wars throughout history has never been determined by the amount of money. Money is necessary for victory in this war, but the path to victory is not solely based on that. Why do people speak of this problem with trivial and mediocre arguments, or hold the view that the only way to aid Britain is to repeal the law so that money can be supplied to Britain for use in the US? It should be known that this kind of view can be described as narrow and constricted. Direct cash donations may be beneficial, but he cannot confirm that they are necessary. The President also said that Britain's orders in the US are a tremendous asset for the US because they result in the convenience of adding factories, munitions plants, and shipyards. The new plan he is proposing has been under consideration for three or four weeks. This is one of the various plans that can be considered. Since the types of military equipment ordered by Britain are the same as those used by the US, Britain's orders can be converted to ones that the US has sufficient funds to handle. He believes that Britain is capable of paying for the goods it has already ordered in the US. As for this new approach, it only focuses on future orders. (Reuters, 18th)

US Deeply Feels Need to Aid Britain, May Revise Johnson Act

Washington – Treasury Secretary Morgenthau told the House Appropriations Subcommittee yesterday that unless Britain's economic aid is guaranteed, Britain will not be able to order additional war materials from the US. According to a key member of the committee, Morgenthau's attitude is that Congress should address the issue of economic aid to Britain, but he did not propose a plan. Several congressional leaders said that they will request the amendment or repeal of the "Johnson Act" when Congress convenes in January next year to make it easier to provide aid to Britain again. (United Press, 18th)

Washington – The urgent need to accelerate US war material production and rapidly increase aid to Britain has now become the most important issue in Washington. President Roosevelt's return to the White House from his inspection in the West Indies was welcomed by US newspapers, expressing concern about the current situation and strongly arguing the urgency of the situation. The most recent development yesterday was Treasury Secretary Morgenthau's statement to news reporters that the British have indicated that unless the US provides financial assistance, Britain will no longer be able to purchase war materials in the US. Morgenthau also repeatedly stated that the US can only make loans to Britain if Congress amends or repeals the Johnson Act. Morgenthau's words gave listeners the impression that this decision rests entirely with Congress. It is reported that Morgenthau only analyzed Britain's needs in terms of facts and did not express any opinions. At the same time, it is also reported that Secretary of State Hull has stated to the Defense Committee and other government officials that if the current quantity of US war material supplies is not greatly increased, Britain may encounter difficulties next spring. Hull advocates speeding up the manufacture of military aircraft and other supplies. It is heard that the US authorities are currently investigating the shipping situation to determine whether more merchant ships can be dispatched to transport war materials to Britain. A Washington newspaper published a two-column article stating that the US will exert all its great activity to deal with national defense difficulties. In addition to repealing the Johnson Act, the US has many ways to financially aid Britain, such as purchasing raw materials in the British Empire market at higher prices and purchasing British-owned interests in the US. Landon, the Republican candidate for 1936, yesterday expressed his impressions of his visit to Washington in Topeka, Kansas, saying that he had heard and witnessed reliable aspects of the official circles, but Hitler intends to invade England in mid-February, and he felt that the Washington administration was quite anxious and uneasy about the US's failure to adjust its national defense activities. (Reuters, 18th)

Tokyo – The "Hochi Shimbun" today commented on the proposal made by US New York Democratic Congressman Bloom on Sunday regarding amending the US Neutrality Act. The newspaper believes that if this happens, the US would, in effect, be indicating that it is participating in the European war. It also stated that this amendment, in terms of the Sino-Japanese War, will also have an indirect and broad impact. The newspaper stated that Japan should closely monitor any actions by the US that may be unfavorable to Japan. (Taichung News Agency, 18th)

### Vichy Bows to Others; Laval Back in Favor; German Spies Demand Expansion of Territory Occupied; French Cabinet Holds Meeting to Discuss Countermeasures

Vichy – An official announcement stated that French Head of State Marshal Pétain received former Foreign Minister and Vice-Premier Laval at 8:18 PM last night to discuss the general political situation. Laval was dismissed last Saturday and, at the request of the German Ambassador to France, Abetz, is no longer subject to surveillance by French police. (United Press, 18th)

Pétain Received German Ambassador Abetz the Day Before Yesterday

Vichy – Yesterday afternoon, the official report here on German Ambassador to Paris Abetz's visit to Vichy stated that German Ambassador Abetz arrived in Vichy on the night of the 16th. Marshal Pétain received him at 10:00 AM yesterday morning. Marshal Pétain also hosted a luncheon for Abetz at noon, inviting Navy Minister Admiral Darlan, Army Minister General Huntziger, and Minister without Portfolio Baudouin to accompany them. It is also learned that when Marshal Pétain received Abetz yesterday morning, former Associate Premier and Foreign Minister Laval, who has now been dismissed, was also present. (Haitong News Agency, 18th)

Demands for Expansion of Occupied Territory Will Be a Future Challenge

Vichy – The dismissed French Deputy Premier Laval returned to Vichy last night. Laval has apparently been treated favorably by the French government and regained his freedom through significant pressure from Germany. Hitler's confidant, German Ambassador to France Abetz, has set off for Paris and will report on the "general situation" to Hitler by phone. Although this general situation is extremely chaotic and unclear due to numerous rumors and strict censorship, Germany's use of pressure on France is becoming increasingly apparent. A brief government communiqué stated that Laval, Marshal Pétain, German Ambassador Abetz, French Navy Chief Darlan, Army Chief Huntziger, and former Foreign Minister Baudouin jointly held a meeting. According to the London Daily Telegraph, the German ultimatum demanding an expansion of the occupied area will likely be issued after Laval's release. (International News Service, 18th)

Pétain's Policies May Not Be Able to Be Implemented

London – A telegram from the German border of non-occupied France stated that the dismissal of Vichy's former Deputy Premier and Foreign Minister Laval seems to be primarily due to domestic policies, but the Vichy dispatch has not fully clarified the reasons. Laval tried to make Vichy Premier Marshal Pétain an instrument of his pro-German policies, or has encountered strong opposition, and this opposition has become stronger due to the changes in the Mediterranean situation. It is heard that Laval presented a proposal for a wide-ranging internal reorganization and a new peace proposal from the German side to the Vichy cabinet last week, all of which were rejected. Afterwards, Pétain received Laval. It is widely speculated that Pétain intended to adopt a more honorable policy than Laval and was determined not to agree to hand over French colonial bases to German control. However, British victories in the Mediterranean have allowed a faction led by Vichy Navy Chief Admiral Darlan to rise again. The hope of a separate Franco-German peace settlement is based on the fact that Italy has become much weaker. France may now be able to persuade Germany to cancel most of its demands on France, and the obstacles that previously deadlocked Franco-German negotiations may be removed. Since Laval's policies have completely failed, Vichy's new Foreign Minister Flandin will have to carefully consider how to handle these matters. German special envoy Abetz's visit to Vichy shows that Germany is not completely satisfied with Flandin's appointment as Foreign Minister. There are even rumors that Germany may feel the need to send troops to occupy Lyon. Judging from dispatches from Italy, the Italians' growing anxiety about the war is increasing day by day. For example, there are widespread rumors in Italy that former Italian Army Chief of Staff General Badoglio and other generals have been shot for treason. (Reuters, 18th)

Laval and Pétain Quarrel; Imprisoned in Ancient Castle for Three Days

New York – The United Press received a secret European report that French Premier Pétain strongly denounced Deputy President Laval for conspiring to seize control of the remaining French government. Therefore, he forced him to draft his own resignation in front of the cabinet meeting. In this tense scene, the 84-year-old general and the dark-faced deputy premier glared at each other. Soon after, Laval was placed under house arrest by the police. It was not until yesterday that he regained his freedom with the intervention of the German ambassador and consulted with Marshal Pétain again. It is heard that Laval was plotting to assume the position of Premier. After Laval stepped down, his office was searched by the police, and a large number of special police were on guard around the Park Hotel where the government was located. Secret police led by Chief of Police Magnan secretly opened the door and took Laval to his private castle 20 miles away, where he was locked up with his wife and daughters. Armed guards stood watch outside the castle for three days. As for Flandin, Marshal Pétain had asked him ten days ago whether he would be willing to succeed Laval if Laval resigned. Flandin then consulted the German side, and the result was favorable. (United Press, 18th)

### Asahi Shimbun on Japan-Soviet Fishery Agreement

Tokyo – Today's editorial in Asahi Shimbun urges the government to conclude a long-term basic fishery agreement with the Soviet Union within one year in accordance with Article 2 of last year's Japan-Soviet provisional fishery agreement. It is claimed that the new fishery agreement should aim to obtain fishing rights and stabilize fishery management. Concluding a long-term fishery agreement on an equal basis will be more helpful than anything else to improving the current Soviet-Japanese relations. (Reuters, 18th)

Editorial

### The Chronic Thai-Vietnamese Dispute

The territorial dispute between Thailand and Vietnam has been marked by armed conflict since late last month, lasting almost a month. During this period, major international changes have included the waning of Axis power, the strengthening of British and American aid to China against Japan, and the recent changes in the French political situation. However, none of these seem to affect the hostile actions between Thailand and Vietnam. Although it has not yet evolved into a large-scale formal war, it is still developing. Aside from the British-Greek-German-Italian war in Europe and Africa and the Sino-Japanese war in the Far East, it has already formed a state of localized chronic ailment. It has recently been reported that a Vietnamese "Restoration Army," armed and equipped under the wing of a certain party, has been discovered in southern Guangxi, and internal turmoil has repeatedly occurred in Vietnam, further increasing the complexity and precariousness of the situation in the Indochinese Peninsula. If this continues, whether this spark will spread into a prairie fire is difficult to say. However, in today's precarious situation in the Far East, one cannot but regard this as a most worrying and unfortunate state. As for Thailand and Vietnam themselves, each lacks sufficient conditions for warfare, and the focus of their dispute has been a problem for four or five decades, with no new factors requiring immediate resolution. However, in fact, developments are creating a long-standing dispute during this unusually turbulent time in the Far East. This is固 Thailand's vigorous implementation of nationalism and France's weakening national strength after the war, but it ultimately makes it difficult to understand what the purpose of those promoting this dispute is. Of course, the instigation of ambition is one of the driving forces, and looking at Thailand's movements, it seems that they do not dare to deeply trust this external assistance. If the Axis powers had not suffered successive setbacks in Europe and Africa, resulting in those who were prepared to echo them to disrupt the overall situation in the Far East losing their foothold, it is hard to imagine what the state of Thailand and Vietnam, and even the entire Southeast Asia, would be. The most peculiar thing is that the authorities in Thailand and Vietnam, at this difficult time, cannot seem to understand this, and only focus on the territorial disputes of small gains, leading to a situation where they are locked in a stalemate that will lead to war. They seem to be blind to the arrival of a real crisis; they even want to use the help of ambitious people to elevate themselves, or even want them to mediate. There is no greater ignorance or foolishness. According to recent news, the 方 authorities have both shown a tendency to hope for a peaceful resolution, but there is no sign of mutual compromise. Moreover, the French and Vietnamese authorities claim that they will severely retaliate against Thai military incursions, while the Thai side has stated that it will not cease its actions until equal treatment is fully eliminated. In this situation, it is still difficult to expect negotiations to achieve anything quickly.

All the direct and indirect troubles in the South China Sea are caused by Japan's southward policy, but the current international situation is clearly unfavorable to large-scale adventures. On the other hand, it will inevitably intensify the creation or seeking of exploitable opportunities to realize its ambitions. Events such as the Thai-Vietnamese war and the various turmoils within Vietnam are perfectly suited to this requirement. In Vietnam, although its northern part is now under its control, that can only be regarded as a preliminary preparation for achieving the ambitious country's goals. Because this northern part alone does not have much military value in advancing south. Cam Ranh Bay and Saigon are its important targets that it will not let go. Because these two strongholds are like the heart of the South China Sea, enough to be linked with Haiphong, Hainan Island, and Taiwan, forming the forefront base for advancing south. Recent Thai-Vietnamese military operations are all in the lower Mekong River area, which can easily affect the entire southern part of Vietnam. If Japan's wishes are fulfilled, the offensive and defensive situation in the South China Sea will be completely changed, and the threat to the Dutch East Indies and British Malaya will be even more serious. Therefore, the Thai-Vietnamese issue must not be ignored as a mere spark.

This newspaper recently discussed the Thai-Vietnamese dispute, pointing out that the difficulty of achieving a compromise lies in the lack of a compromise focus between the parties, and secondly, the absence of international pressure that can be used. Unfortunately, this situation has not improved to date. However, the current problem is not only whether a Thai-Vietnamese compromise is possible in terms of the objective situation, but in order to ensure the peace of the South China Sea and the entire Southeast Asia, the crisis in the Indochinese Peninsula must be eliminated. If this task cannot be achieved, then the defense of Southeast Asia will be doubly difficult. British and American countries, for fear of harming the vase, are afraid of creating the result of driving fish into the deep. Therefore, they are unwilling to participate in it and engage in mediation, but letting it develop naturally is even more inadvisable. Of course, arbitration of this dispute is extremely difficult. At the very least, gentle advice should be given to both parties, and guarantees should be provided to reserve this territorial dispute for a reasonable resolution after the restoration of the international order in the future. Although the current Thai and Vietnamese authorities' expressions of hope for a peaceful resolution are weak, they should be regarded as the budding of remorse and should be strongly encouraged to promote their further awareness. In light of the current situation, the difficult problem faced by both Thailand and Vietnam is by no means the territorial issues between them, but the ambitions of third countries. With the richness and strategic position of the Vietnamese-Thai peninsula, it already has the conditions for ordinary people to possess valuable treasures, let alone fighting each other? In addition to earnestly hoping that the Thai people will be aware of the perilousness of their situation and the futility of relying on the fisherman's advantage, it is also hoped that the French and Vietnamese authorities will understand that the Thai demand for land is actually the result of previous concessions by France and Vietnam to Japan. If France and Vietnam cannot firmly resist and reject Japan's harsh demands, then even if they use force against Thailand, they will not be able to subdue the Thai people and prevent them from despising them. It is not too late to mend the fold now, but it depends on the skillful management of those involved.

### The Northwest Provinces: Political and Economic Situation is Optimistic; Muslims Will Definitely Cooperate Closely with the Central Government; Central Government Officials Strive to Avoid Friction with the Communist Party

Chongqing – Recently, a certain person traveled extensively through the northwest provinces of Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, Shaanxi, and Henan, and has now arrived in Chongqing. He is very optimistic about the political, economic, and military situation in the northwest provinces. He said that Muslims can now be assured of close cooperation with the central government. This is due to the political achievements of General Zhu Shaoliang, Commander-in-Chief of the Garrison Forces in the four provinces of Gansu, Suiyuan, Ningxia, and Qinghai. The Muslim leaders General Ma Bufang, Ma Buqing, and Ma Hongkui have all assured Zhu that they will give their utmost assistance. The northwestern part of Gansu Province, formerly garrisoned by the Communist army, no longer has any Communist Party presence and is now entirely governed by the central government. The northwest highway from Gansu to Xinjiang is in good condition and is currently maintained by the military for transportation. Although there is no fixed schedule for military supplies transported from the Soviet Union, all goods transported are strictly guarded by the government authorities. The highway connecting Xinjiang to the Chinese Communist Party is also managed by the government authorities. According to this traveler, the Soviet Union will certainly not help the Chinese Communist Party to overthrow the central government, because the Soviet Union deeply understands that China will be an important player in future international developments. As long as the Kuomintang is in power, the Soviet Union will continue to assist the Nationalist government. Although central government personnel in the northwest are striving to avoid friction with the Communist Party in Shaanxi and other places, the central government authorities are neither arrogant nor humble towards the Communist Party and are determined not to make any concessions. General Yan Xishan was finally able to completely eliminate the pro-Communist elements under his command. Although the central government has offered Yan a high position, it is said that Yan replied that he must recover the land of his province before he can accept the position from the central government, and is currently residing in his province, leading troops in combat. With a large army stationed in the northwest, the residents can rely on peace and stability, which can both prevent the Japanese army from invading and prevent internal disturbances from occurring. The Longhai Railway in Baoji is only 600 meters away from the Japanese artillery positions, but it is still operating as usual. The residents of Chongqing treat the Japanese bombing as routine, and their nerves can be said to be as strong as steel. However, the residents of Baoji have been subjected to Japanese air raids for several days, as well as artillery and machine gun fire from the Japanese army on the opposite bank of the Yellow River, and they are still living their lives peacefully. Their nerves are even better than those of the residents of Chongqing. The Chinese army guarding the Yellow River has very high morale. According to one soldier, they have been preventing the Japanese army from crossing the river for three years now, and even after another three years, the Japanese army will still not be able to fly across. Elite Chinese troops are now being sent continuously into the occupied areas of the Yangtze River basin and various places on the southern bank of the Yellow River, and are consolidating the positions in the four provinces of Henan, Shandong, Anhui, and Jiangsu, waiting for an opportunity to counterattack.

### Anti-Japanese Leaflets Discovered in Vietnam

Hanoi – It has been widely rumored recently that anti-Japanese leaflets have been discovered in Vietnam, attacking Japan's policy of invading Vietnam. This news has now been confirmed by the United Press. The Cochinchina branch of the Anti-Imperialist Party of Vietnam distributed leaflets and posted slogans, stating that Vietnam has become a Japanese colony and fiercely attacking the appeasement policy of the French authorities.

### British Forces Adopt Encirclement Strategy, Launch Full-Scale Offensive on Bardia; Free French Forces Fight Shoulder-to-Shoulder with British, Encountering Stiff Resistance from Blackshirt Troops

London – According to a telegram received here yesterday, a large number of British infantry, artillery, tanks, and mechanized units are currently advancing on Bardia and have approached the coastal road, the only route for Italian supplies and reinforcements. British bombers are heavily bombarding Bardia in four waves, aiming to isolate the city and assist ground forces in clearing nearby areas. British forces are reenacting the encirclement strategy used to capture Sidi Barrani and Sollum. However, Bardia's defenses are stronger than those of any other city, making it seem less easily breached than the previous two locations. It is believed that the Italian troops stationed in Bardia include remnants of the 62nd and 63rd Divisions that escaped from Egypt, as well as some Blackshirt units retreating from Sidi Barrani. Currently, British forces have a significant advantage in this operation: they can readily increase troop reinforcements at any time, while the Italians' only lifeline is the road to Tobruk. (Reuters, 18th)

Cairo – British mechanized units, in high spirits, are continuing their advance toward Bardia with great speed. Following closely behind is a continuous stream of infantry, mostly traveling in captured Italian trucks. Fierce fighting is occurring in the Bardia area of Libya. The leading elements of the British mechanized forces, after fighting their way across the desert, are now pressing against the Bardia port defense lines. The vanguard of the British infantry is also advancing with the mechanized units. Since breaching the Italian Libyan border, British forces have used rapid assault tactics to seize three border forts within Italian territory. On the right flank of the front lines, the Free French forces are providing valuable assistance to the British Empire forces. The French forces demonstrated their bravery during the last attack on Sollum. Although French tactics differ significantly from those of the British, months of arduous training have transformed the French into a skilled fighting force, now fighting alongside their British comrades. The rapid British progress is almost unbelievable, but it would be a serious error to conclude that the Italian forces are not resisting. Initially, the British attack caught the Italians by surprise, leaving them with no time or opportunity to resist. However, according to reliable information from wounded soldiers fighting near the border, the Italian forces, now having had ample time to prepare their defenses, are putting up a very determined fight. (Reuters, 18th)

Cairo – British forces yesterday drove the last of the Italian troops out of Egypt and are closing in on Bardia, near the Libyan border. British infantry and mechanized units are launching a major offensive against Inez Sidi Omar and Saffa, destroying enemy resistance south of Bardia to pave the way for an attack on the coastal city. The Italian forces initially offered considerable resistance along the various lines, but once these were cleared, British forces encountered no further resistance and reached the defensive perimeter four or five miles from Bardia. (United Press, 18th)

Royal Air Force Demonstrates Power

Cairo – The British Air Force Headquarters announced that British aircraft on Sunday bombed Italian airfields along the Libyan coast from Bardia to Tobruk, dropping over twelve bombs on Italian army camps and railways in Bardia, causing major fires. It also stated that the damage in various Italian Libyan locations such as Tobruk, Bomba, Bena, Aden, El Gubs, and El Gazala, was extremely heavy. British aircraft shot down eight Italian aircraft. In addition, ten No. 42 aircraft and five No. 79 aircraft captured at Sollum had already been damaged and rendered unusable during previous British bombing raids. (United Press, 18th)

Cairo – The British Air Force Command announced last night that British aircraft, braving adverse weather, heavily bombed Durazzo, a key port in Albania. Bombs hit the dockyard area, causing explosions. All British aircraft returned safely. Also, Gura and Asmara in Italian East Africa were bombed by British aircraft on the night of December 15. After the attack on Gura, flames soared high. One British bomber was damaged by enemy fighters but managed to fly back to British territory. In Asmara, a factory and a transportation depot were bombed. In addition, enemy bombers attacked Port Sudan four times, but no British Air Force buildings or private residences were damaged. (Reuters, 18th)

Account of the Fall of the Sollum Fortress

Cairo – A Reuters correspondent wired from Sollum in the western desert, reporting that yesterday, British infantry prepared to cross the border into Libya to participate in the major offensive. In recent days, they had pursued Italian forces out of Egyptian territory, and by the time they captured Sollum on Sunday, they were quite exhausted. However, the victorious army advanced with great momentum. Sollum is just a small port, surrounded by a few white houses. Upstream from the port is Upper Sollum, which formerly housed an Egyptian army camp, but the camp had been bombed by the British when it was occupied by Italian forces. In recent days, reporters and several interviewers, along with one American, observed the battle in Sollum as the British offensive on Sollum reached its final stages. The tactical planning was very thorough. A week earlier, a British armored division captured another destination and then stormed through Buq Buq, and Sollum was first alerted. At that time, General Annibale Bergonzoli and his Catanzaro Division officers and soldiers were en route to Sidi Barrani to relieve the troops. They thought that the war was still far away, but they did not expect the British forces to arrive in an instant, catching them completely by surprise and unprepared, so that most of the soldiers were captured, and all their materials were scattered along the road and seized by the British. When the British forces attacked Sollum, they advanced on several routes at the same time. Tanks bombarded the Italian forces guarding Sollum with heavy artillery fire. The British Air Force also bombed non-stop. Some tanks became bogged down in the sand for a time, causing the British advance to slow down slightly. At the same time, an infantry brigade also moved forward, ordered not to formally attack Sollum but to carry out a feinting action, preventing any Italian soldiers from escaping. By Sunday, the Sollum garrison, seeing that their situation was critical, moved to the top of the slope and destroyed the road. British infantry braved the Italian artillery fire on the slope and captured Lower Sollum. That afternoon, the Italian forces on the slope surrendered. The British were preparing to accommodate the Italian prisoners of war captured at Sollum at Buq Buq, which was completed by Sunday. More than 12,000 Italian prisoners of war were issued water when they set off. (Reuters, 18th)

What Was Seen Along the Desert Battlefield

London – A Reuters correspondent wired from the western desert, reporting that when Italian forces invaded Egypt months ago, they built a road from the Libyan border to Sidi Barrani. The reporter recently traveled along this road and saw stones commemorating Mussolini planted all along the way, as well as a monument erected before the road was built, inscribed with the words, "The 12th Artillery Squadron, under enemy plots and the fierce sun and wind, built this road connecting the sands of Libya and Egypt." Although this road has not yet been paved with asphalt, it has become a British line of communication for the offensive against Libya and is of no small use. Buq Buq itself has only one isolated house and several Italian water troughs, currently guarded by British sentries, drawing water and distributing it to the Italian prisoners of war passing by. On the night of the 16th of this month, thousands of Italian prisoners of war were escorted to Buq Buq, gathering around the water troughs. A British infantry major was responsible for distributing food and drink to the Italian forces. As the reporters were talking with the major, an Italian officer stepped forward to pay his respects and requested a vehicle to transport several wounded soldiers to the infirmary. The major immediately granted his request and allowed the Italian doctor to drive himself. At the same time, British aircraft repeatedly bombarded Bardia, and the sound of exploding bombs and the roar of anti-aircraft guns reverberated through the air. The reporters climbed the coastal highlands east of Sollum and looked out at Bardia, seeing the intensity of the anti-aircraft fire and bomb explosions, which had never been seen before in North Africa.

British Forces in East Africa Launch Offensive

Cairo – Last night, British forces launched a large-scale offensive in Italian East Africa, 2,000 miles from here. Although details are not immediately available, senior officials here said that the sharpness of the British offensive is the same as in the Libyan campaign. (International Telegram, 18th)

Nairobi – According to a public announcement here, South African troops and troops from the entire coast participated in the British offensive on the Italian Somaliland border at El Wak. This operation was a combined offensive by armored units and infantry, capturing at least 25 Italians, including several officers and 50 Italian colonial infantry. In addition, they also obtained artillery, machine guns, and large quantities of military supplies and ammunition. The Italian casualties were also 50. British casualties were minimal. The South African Air Force assisted in the operation and dropped two and a half tons of bombs. One enemy aircraft attacked, but was driven away by British fighters. Another enemy aircraft, seeing the shadow of British fighters, abandoned its remaining bombs and fled. One Italian Caproni aircraft has been shot down by British aircraft. El Wak is located 100 miles northeast of Wajir in Kenya and is one of the main border outposts in Italian Somaliland. (Reuters, 18th)

### Greek Troops on Central Front Launch Bayonet Charge, Capturing Këlcyrë Yesterday; This City is an Important Gateway to Berat; Port of Durazzo Heavily Bombed by British Air Force

Struga – Border news reports that at 9:30 this morning, Greek troops occupied Këlcyrë, a key defensive point and gateway to Berat, strongly defended by Italian troops. (United Press, 18th)

Athens – A Greek Army communiqué stated that Greek troops continue to operate across the entire front and are quite successful. Italian troops are under heavy pressure and have suffered many losses, retreating to the entrenched Këlcyrë. Greek troops have seized large quantities of materials and captured some Italian soldiers, including a lieutenant colonel. Italian troops have now withdrawn from the key southern Albanian cities of Tepelenë and Gjirokastër, abandoning large quantities of materials accumulated over the past few months. Although Greek operations have been hampered by heavy snow, the fierce fighting after the fall of Pogradec was still profitable for the Greek troops. It is generally believed that the Greek positions along the entire front are quite satisfactory. In recent days, the weather has been very cold, and the Greek advance is expected to slow down gradually. (Reuters, 18th)

Athens – A Greek government spokesman said that even in the face of howling winds and falling snow, Greek troops are still bravely fighting in the Këlcyrë area. As the Greek Army is charging across the front lines in Albania, aircraft of the British Royal Air Force are also heavily bombing military locations on the Adriatic coast, again subjecting the important seaport of Durazzo to severe attack. The government spokesman continued that the most important battles have been taking place around Këlcyrë for the past two days. The enemy there is retreating from Mount Trebeshina. In recent days, the Italians' "remarkable resistance" has been due to the arrival of reinforcements ten miles east of Tepelenë. However, the Greek bayonet and melee fighting will eventually drive the Italian troops out of the highlands in Mount Trebeshina. Këlcyrë is the last important fortified position between the Greek location and Berat. Berat is twenty miles north of Këlcyrë and is the main connecting point for Italian supply and transport. It is reported that the British Air Force's bombing of the port of Durazzo has made it very difficult for Italian troops to land. It is rumored that Italian troops are heavily reinforcing this port in preparation for building a second line of defense once the fronts in the south from Vlorë to Elbasan and Lake Ohrid collapse. The spokesman continued that the Italian counter-offensive in the mountainous city and the coastal area behind Vlorë is an attempt to buy time to allow Italian artillery units in the mountains to build strong positions. However, Greek troops are pressing forward with the plan to crush the Fascists. Also, according to a British Air Force communiqué, the British Air Force, which has continuously bombed the Albanian seaport of Vlorë for several days, rendering it useless, further concentrated its attacks on Durazzo last night. British aviators who went to bomb Durazzo witnessed huge explosions and fires in the port's dockyards. British aircraft completed their missions and returned safely. Also, news from Struga on the north shore of Lake Ohrid in Yugoslavia says that Greek troops have advanced one-third of the way on the twenty-seven mile route from Tepelenë to Vlorë. It is also heard that the Greek troops have benefited greatly from the unrest in Albania and are now attacking the Italian rear, causing turmoil and disturbance in the Italian military's morale. Also, the Greek Ministry of the Army declared that the Greek artillery units have heavily bombed Këlcyrë, an important city located ten miles east of Tepelenë. On Mount Asim and further north, Greek troops have captured five Italian officers and 300 soldiers. Also, the Greek troops attacking along the coast have achieved the same success as the Greek troops near Tepelenë. After a short period of intense fighting, they have occupied Fterra, a few miles north of Himara. The Greek government spokesman also denied reports that Italian troops had reoccupied Palermë south of Himara, declaring that it is now in Greek hands. In the Pogradec area northeast of Tepelenë, although the mountain paths are very snowy and there are several deep snowdrifts, Greek troops are still advancing. Also, Radio Athens stated that even in adverse weather with rain and snow, our troops are making progress and have occupied several new positions and mountain villages of great strategic importance. These positions and villages were defended to the death by Italian troops. (United Press, 18th)

### Rumor of 50,000 German Troops Concentrated in Southern Italy; Nazi Spy Activities Deeply Infiltrated into Italy; Mussolini May Become the Second Quisling

New York – According to a telegram received here from the capital of Yugoslavia, 50,000 German troops and large quantities of military supplies are now concentrated in Naples and Bari. It is claimed that this news comes from reliable sources. It is not yet known whether these German troops are intended for use in Libya or Albania. According to several reports received here, these German troops will perform security duties within Italy. (Reuters, 18th)

London – The Times recently published an article discussing the possibility of a Nazi occupation of Italy, saying that for the past two years, Italy has been riddled with various Nazi spies, as dense as beehives. After the outbreak of the war, the situation has become even more serious than before. The various methods commonly used by the Nazis before an invasion, which have been remarkably effective in Norway and the Netherlands, are also being implemented one by one in Italy. If the Italian side does not act quickly to deal with its internal threats, it will one day wake up and find that Italy has become an occupied area, and Mussolini is in the same position as Vidkun Quisling.

### Berlin Denies German-Italian Friction

Berlin – The Berlin Völkischer Beobachter published an article today strongly denying British reports that Germany and Italy had developed differences due to Italian military setbacks in Egypt. It declared that Germany would never abandon its friends halfway. Britain, towards its allies, often turns a blind eye when they encounter misfortune after completing their mission. It is judging others by its own standards, thinking that Germany's attitude towards Italy would be like Britain's towards its former allies, given the recent defeats of the Italian army in Egypt and Albania. However, Germany and Italy share common ideals and are fighting shoulder to shoulder in a war of liberation. Germany's unstoppable momentum has benefited from Italy's support. Although Italy's war is not going smoothly today, victory and defeat are commonplace in war. Temporary setbacks are not enough to shake the deeply rooted belief between the two nations. Germany and Italy are determined to form a united front to inflict a serious blow on the enemy and strive for final victory. (Haitong News Agency, 18th)

### Italian Government Strictly Controls Food Supply; Hoarders Will Be Executed

The people of the country have expressed great welcome for this measure. The police have been carrying out inspections to expose private hoarding.

### Sweden Expresses Fear of the "New Order"; Military Control of the World Cannot Guarantee Lasting Peace

Stockholm – The Swedish Foreign Minister said in a speech in Mynt yesterday that the new order and the distribution of living space included in the public announcements of the Axis powers and Japan cannot naturally attract the attention of Sweden and other small countries. If this were the case, all small countries would be placed within the designated space and lose their independence, and even the industries of the small countries would be subject to control and supervision to meet the needs of the great powers. It must be understood that dividing the world and making the small countries appendages of the living space of several great powers is difficult to guarantee lasting peace. (Reuters, 18th)

### The Three Small Countries of Europe: Their Fate and Future

The Government of San Marino Denies Command of Its Thousand-Man Army by Italy

The capital of Switzerland: It was rumored that the Republic of San Marino had placed its one thousand soldiers under the command of the Italian Army General Staff and was planning to declare war on Britain. However, the government of San Marino has issued a public statement denying this. As the territories of various European countries undergo drastic changes, the three small countries of Liechtenstein, Andorra, and San Marino have been fortunate enough to avoid invasion. The future fate of these countries is attracting worldwide attention. San Marino, located on the Adriatic coast, has an area of only 40 square miles and a population of only 14,000. Its national army consists of only 70 constables. However, the country claims that after a full national mobilization, it can field an army of one thousand soldiers. Although San Marino is an independent country, it has traditionally been under the "friendly protection" of the King of Italy. In 1887, it signed a treaty with Italy stipulating that San Marino could not be placed under the protection of another country. (Havas News Agency, 17th)

### The Largest Spectacle in History: The Closing of the New York World's Fair (Continued)

The artworks in the Czechoslovakian Pavilion, except for those that have been sold, will mostly be loaned to various museums for display. The rare tropical birds in the Spanish Pavilion will be moved to Central Park. The American national products in the Federal Building will be distributed to various departments of the government in Washington. Among the items in the foreign exhibition areas that will remain in Flushing Meadows Park are the flagpole in front of the Swedish Pavilion, the fountain in front of the Turkish Pavilion, and the floral columns of the Canadian Pavilion.

According to the opinions of experts in industry and commerce, the various industrial products displayed at this New York World's Fair have been very effective in promoting industry and commerce, imparting knowledge, and arousing interest. After the closing, the exhibits of various manufacturers will either be transported to other locations for exhibition or moved to the branches of their companies, depending on their environment and needs. Therefore, people who did not visit the fair will have the opportunity to see the industrial exhibits again.

The artworks in the art section, considering only the masterpieces of great painters from various countries, are worth 30 million US dollars. On the day after the closing, the authorities dispatched armed police and used more than a dozen large trucks to move these precious treasures to warehouses in New York City, awaiting their retrieval by the more than two hundred exhibitors and the more than one hundred museum authorities. The "Art Association Company," which does not operate for profit, will dissolve immediately after all the exhibits are returned to their owners. The artistic works of modern writers will also be returned to their original exhibitors.

The exhibits in the jewelry section, worth 6 million US dollars, were moved out of the venue under armed protection on the day of the closing. The jewelry pavilion will not be demolished and will remain in Flushing Meadows Park as an embellishment. There were a total of six jewelry exhibitors. After the closing, their items were returned to their original owners, ensuring that each jewel was returned to its rightful place.

Many items at the fair were of great value, which will not be listed exhaustively. Even considering the various buildings alone, there was a wide variety of styles and unique designs, including futuristic, nationalistic, and regional styles. Visitors were delighted by all the expressions of "The World of Tomorrow" and enjoyed them to the fullest. Moreover, for the sake of appreciation, commemoration, and research, tourists all took photographs on the spot to aid their future reveries. According to the estimate of Mr. Mass, who is in charge of the photography section at the fair, 62% of the tourists brought cameras and captured the scenes they liked into their "cameras" at any time.

From 2:00 AM on October 28th, this once extremely grand World's Fair began its demolition process. Except for those items that will be left as embellishments in Flushing Meadows Park, all buildings, "obelisks," "spheres," gardens, and Washington statues, totaling 60 million US dollars in construction value, will be demolished. To facilitate the progress of the demolition work, the entire area has been divided into eight sections, with work proceeding in each section. The buildings to be demolished include 50 industrial buildings, 22 foreign pavilions, 4 US government buildings, and 125 buildings in the entertainment area. In total, there are 385 buildings to be demolished, which may take four to six months to complete. The section from the central courthouse, the central path, the tree-lined avenue, to Peace Square will be preserved in Flushing Meadows Park. Many of the complex fountains in the "International Lagoon" will be sold after being dismantled.

The original plan for Flushing Meadows Park included 72 tennis courts, 24 baseball fields, 11 playgrounds, 31 miles of trails, 5.8 miles of bicycle paths, and 4.7 miles of bridle paths. The lake will have a fleet of small boats that can accommodate 600 people. In addition, there will be indoor sports fields, ice rinks, and swimming pools. A portion of this large park is expected to be completed by the end of next year, and the entire project is scheduled for completion by the end of 1942.

This year's "Great White Way" and the entertainment area at the fair had a surplus in addition to covering expenses. Although the area was smaller than in 1939, the configuration of various lights and decorations was strengthened more than sevenfold, so the attraction to the audience was greatly enhanced compared to two years ago. After the closing, the various amusement rides in the entertainment area will be sold. Amusement park owners across the country are eager to acquire them, and it is said that their value is still half of the original price. The most popular performance in the entertainment area was the aerial parachuting, which was watched by 20,000 people during the two fair periods.

The most appealing attraction in the entertainment area was the water show, which was watched by a total of 8 million paying visitors over the two years, with 3 million this year. Other attractions, such as the Paris street scene performance, dance camps, and music halls, attracted more than 4.86 million visitors. The National Day commemorative parade attracted 2 million visitors. These are all high attendance records for the fair.

Very few crimes occurred during the fair. The police authorities handled only 254 arrest cases, mostly for minor offenses such as disorderly conduct. Apart from the bomb explosion in the Polish Pavilion on July 4, which killed and injured eight people, there were no other significant crime records. Thefts were also very rare. During the 1939 fair, 1,860 bottles of wine and brandy were stolen from the Romanian Pavilion. The culprit was arrested three days later, and all the stolen goods were returned to their owner. The fair police will continue to serve for two weeks after the closing.

The number of accidents at this year's fair was 50% lower than in 1939. According to a report by Dr. Hogland, the medical director of the fair, a total of 30,000 people sought treatment at the fair this year, suffering from various ailments. The most common ailments were eye problems, headaches, fatigue, and foot soreness. In 1940, only 14 people died at the fair. Twelve people died from heart attacks, and two died from injuries sustained in the bomb explosion. The mortality rate in 1939 was also 14 people, but one person died in an accident.

The total number of people who traveled to the fair from various places was 90 million. Thirty million people traveled on the vehicles of American Express and Greyhound Bus Company. Among them, the business of the bus company was the best, accounting for more than 28.5 million people.

The parking lot opened by the World's Fair Corporation accommodated 1,800,911 cars during the two-year period, with 800,000 cars this year. The parking fee this year was 25 cents per car, which was 50 cents lower than in 1939.

According to a report by the Detective Division of the US Treasury Department, the amount of counterfeit money used at the fair during the 1940 fair period was 684.40 US dollars. Last year it was 1376.20 US dollars. 132 US dollars of the counterfeit money were fake banknotes, and 552 US dollars were counterfeit coins. (End)

### Britain's War Aims: To Liberate Europe and Restore Freedom; No Peace Talks Until This Aim Is Achieved; Great Strength of British Naval and Air Force Replenishment; Sufficient to Counter Germany's Spring Offensive

London: Lord Noel Buxton asked the government in the House of Lords yesterday to comment on any proposals for peace that Germany might make after Italy's entry into the war. Lord Snell, on behalf of the government, replied that the British government could not accept any arrangement that would allow Germany to permanently dominate Europe. The British government is absolutely determined to do everything in its power to remove the shackles of all countries now under the iron heel of Germany and restore their former independence and prosperity. Lord Snell also recalled a statement made by the late Minister of Works, Mr. Burgin, on November 20 regarding Germany's repeated proposals that if Britain would allow Germany to act freely in Europe, Germany would be happy to maintain good relations with Britain. Snell said that the British government was not prepared to discuss this arrangement. (Reuters, 18th)

London: Lord Beaverbrook, the Minister of Aircraft Production, said in a broadcast last night that Hitler is preparing to invade Britain from the sea, land, and air before next spring, with a focus on air invasion. However, Britain is now stronger on all fronts than before and can supply all pilots on the front lines with various types of aircraft. What Britain needs most are Sturge bombers. Aircraft production has doubled in the past four months compared to last year. American aircraft of excellent design are being shipped in steadily and are increasing in number. The quality of some American fighters is comparable to the best British fighters. Hitler relies on a three-legged stool to collude with other countries and rule Europe: (1) air superiority, (2) mechanized troops, and (3) the methods of the Fifth Column and the panic it creates. German newspapers are daily revealing signs that Hitler plans to launch a large air force offensive in the spring. We will counter and overcome this danger with industrial enterprise and courageous spirit. This will be a difficult struggle, but aircraft manufacturers have already taken on difficult tasks and will complete them satisfactorily. The cost of the aircraft lost by Britain in the past four months of air combat has been covered by public donations. The development of the war has now become a contest between the industrial strength of Britain and the combined resources of the warring and conquered countries of Europe. We will quickly destroy the enemy with labor. (Reuters, 18th)

London: Officials here declare that defending against the German submarine threat is not as much a matter of any new technical problem as it was during the last war. The only difficulty was the lack of escort ships, but this has now been completely resolved by the increase in naval warships and the granting of American destroyers. Although not many American destroyers have entered service, it is believed that the equipment on board has been improved to undertake escort duties. It is also reported that the British government has now decided to increase the number of aircraft protecting sea routes. (Reuters, 18th)

### Basel Bombing Incident: Switzerland Protests to Britain, Demanding Compensation for All Losses and Guaranteeing That Similar Incidents Will Not Happen Again

The capital of Switzerland: The Federal Council's Department of the Interior recently issued a statement saying, "Several foreign aircraft invaded the airspace above our city of Basel last night. After investigation, it was confirmed that they belonged to Britain. The bombs dropped on and around the two Basel train stations were also confirmed to be of British manufacture. At the time, a 500-pound bomb pierced the roof of a residential building and landed in the cellar without exploding, making it very easy to identify. The government has instructed its embassy in Britain to lodge a strong protest with the British government, because last night the moon was bright and the snow was clear, making it very easy for pilots to recognize their location, and there should not have been this mistake. In addition to demanding compensation for losses, we also ask the British government to take all measures to guarantee that the same unfortunate event will not happen again." In addition, the Basel state authorities have decided to request the Federal Council to cancel the lighting control measures implemented in the border area of the country, so that foreign aircraft can easily recognize the border between Switzerland and the warring countries. (Havas, 17th)

Bern: The Swiss semi-official news agency reported that the planes that bombed Basel, Switzerland on Monday night were British planes. According to the latest news, 16 bombs were dropped in the area, mostly around the train station at 11:05 PM. Yesterday's Swiss bulletin said that four people were killed and several injured in the bombing, and significant material damage was also sustained. (Reuters, 18th)

### Axis Powers Cooperation: The Two Sides Conclude an Agreement to Prevent Clothing Competition

Rome: A joint German-Italian clothing and fashion industry committee has been established with a cooperation agreement. Its purpose is to prevent unnecessary competition and to exchange colors and styles. The German fashion industry will use Italian artistic creations, and Italy will use German technical improvements and new styles. A permanent fashion committee has now been established to handle fashion exhibitions in both countries, and the export of their products will also be carried out cooperatively. The Dutch "International Textile" fashion magazine has been acquired by the German side for external propaganda purposes. (Haitong News Agency, 18th)

### Duke of Windsor Says He Did Not Ask to Be Ambassador to the US, But He Would Not Refuse the Position

Miami: The Duke of Windsor told reporters that he did not ask to be appointed as ambassador to the United States to succeed Lord Lothian, but if he believes this matter is in the best interests of both Britain and the United States, then he will definitely accept it. The Duke and Duchess of Windsor set sail for Nassau at 10 PM last night on the Southern Cross yacht. (Reuters, 18th)

London: British authoritative sources say that no decision has yet been made regarding the selection of Lord Lothian's successor. Yesterday, there were doubts in the House of Commons about the truth of Lord Lothian's death. Sir Jones asked Foreign Secretary Halifax to provide a detailed report on Lothian's death. Jones said, "I am very eager to hear that Lothian had a good death." (International News Agency, 18th)

Washington: It is declared here that Lord Lothian's ashes will be temporarily stored in the United States until the end of the European war. (Haitong News Agency, 18th)

### Finland Holds Presidential Election

Helsinki: Finland is scheduled to hold a presidential election tomorrow. The election delegates arrived here yesterday, and the election committees met yesterday and discussed until late at night without adjourning. The various political parties in the parliament also met last night, but so far, no candidate for president has been decided. All parties seem to agree to elect a non-partisan leader as president.

Therefore, the intensity of the battle and the excitement of the performance between the two teams tonight are self-evident. The Chinese team is also deeply aware of the importance of tonight's battle, because one defeat will determine the overall situation. They must not be defeated, so they will definitely win. After the first game, the strengths and weaknesses of the Chinese team's lineup have been revealed, so they will take the best of both sides to make up for their weaknesses and fight with the best lineup. Considering that the Chinese team reversed the score by five points in the second half of the game the night before, there is great hope for victory tonight. The referees are Bratt and Zheng Zhifang.

There are not many left, so get them soon. The 410 three-yuan tickets for the upstairs seats are still available, and many have already been purchased.

### YMCA Basketball Yesterday: Hua Xing Defeats Giant in First Game; Shanghai Star Loses to Bears After Hard Fight

The YMCA basketball game was held last night for the second act of this season. The prelude was Shanghai Star vs. Little Bears. The Bears have been dominating the YMCA for years, and recently they have been strengthened by the addition of a new player Yenick, who weighs nearly 250 pounds, making their strength even stronger. Shanghai Star has recently attracted famous players such as Xu Jusheng and Fan Qingxian, and their strength still exists. However, because they have not gathered for a long time, their cooperation lacks understanding. The score was 14 to 27 in the first half. After the break, Shanghai Star demonstrated their full strength and shone brightly. Zhang Jinxuan scored consecutively, and Liang Yunming and Zheng Qinming also contributed, adding as many as 11 points in one breath, chasing from 14 to 27 to 23 to 27, with a difference of only two points. Fan Qingxian scored a shot and two free throws, and instantly chased to 29 to 29. The future was bright, and the hope was great. At this point, the tension reached its peak. Unexpectedly, at this final moment, Dubringki scored two consecutive goals, and Yenick added a free throw, putting the Bears ahead again with 34 to 29. Zhang Jinxuan once again chased to 31 to 34, but unfortunately, after Dubringki added three points, the buzzer sounded, and Shanghai Star was defeated with 31 to 37. The finale was the new strong team Hua Xing in this session. In their first appearance, they faced the Giant. Hua Xing has many talented players, while the Giant's skills were not high, making the two teams seem worlds apart. After Li Zhenzhong opened the scoring, Bao Songyuan added four points. After 6 to 12, Hua Xing was like a rushing river. In the first half, Hua Xing took an absolute advantage with 22 to 8. After the break, Hua Xing was strong and imposing, with the momentum of splitting bamboo. The Giant could only parry and had no chance to fight back. Until the end of the game, they only scored eight points, while Hua Xing added another 19 points. Because Hua Xing was confident of winning, they did not overdo it and did not use their full strength. In summary, they won their first victory of the season with 41 to 16.

### Northern Faction Pours In, Gold Market Soars; There Were Buyers at 6,000 Yuan in the Over-the-Counter Market

Yesterday in the gold market, the spot market fluctuated wildly, falling before suddenly rebounding and soaring, causing the 5,900 yuan threshold to be breached again, before retreating. Rumors spread of a shift in favor of buyers, and it was heard that the northern faction had poured in over 3,000 taels. The foreign exchange market also tightened, and the general sentiment was bullish. Since the market opened in the morning, carrying on the downward momentum from the previous day, it immediately retreated to 5,905 yuan. Securities firms then reported a retreat to 5,890 yuan. As the foreign exchange market stopped loosening and began to tighten, bullish rumors suddenly arose, claiming that "the new central bank and the issuance of banknotes are back in favor," and that "securities firms are vying for gold and the northern faction is increasing its purchases." This led to a dramatic surge, soaring to 5,965 yuan, before settling at 5,960 yuan, a rise of 38 yuan, with a fluctuation of 65 yuan. The total transaction volume for the first half of the day was around 6,000 taels. The afternoon market on Wednesday was closed. The over-the-counter price had risen to 6,000 yuan with buyers. Small money changers were mutually doing 500 taels of swap transactions, with buyers paying sellers 36 yuan. The spot price from gold firms to money changers for 50 taels was 36 yuan lower than the forward price. Silver shops were mutually doing 50 taels, 35 yuan lower. Ornamental gold rose by 5 yuan, to 610 yuan. Customs gold and other items remained unchanged.

Spot Market Surged by 38 Yuan

Since the morning opening at 9:00 a.m., each bar (ten taels) was down 17 yuan. Two silver shops mutually did 20 taels at a price of 5,905 yuan. Xinhao and other firms entered silver shops for dozens of taels, rising to 5,915 yuan. As foreign exchange was reported as hardening, securities firms came to sell aggressively, causing retail investors to push the price down by 25 yuan, to within 5,900 yuan. Securities firms sold dozens of taels to gold firms, dropping to 5,890 yuan. Unexpectedly, gold firms aggressively continued to buy, and as they learned that foreign exchange had turned soft due to the Japanese bank's purchases, a certain securities firm came to buy, supposedly on behalf of the northern faction. Small money changers also scrambled to buy, and the price rebounded to 5,900 yuan, then rose by 75 yuan. A certain money changer entered a silver shop for 100 taels, raising the price to 5,965 yuan. Then, a silver shop sold 30 taels to a gold firm. The noon closing price was 5,960 yuan, a rebound of 38 yuan compared to the previous day. After the closing, the price rose to 5,968 yuan, before settling at 5,960 yuan. The afternoon market on Wednesday was closed. The storefront selling price of the current brand of gold firms was several yuan lower than the spot price, and the buying price was 50 yuan lower than the selling price. There was no market or price for current margin gold.

Ornamental Gold Rose by 5 Yuan

The selling price of silverware and jewelry per tael, quoted by Da Tonghang and Xin Tonghang in the morning, was 605 yuan, rising by 5 yuan at noon to 610 yuan. The buying price was reduced by 30 yuan.

### Demand for Japanese Currency Sharply Reduced

Yesterday, the spot price in the foreign currency market fluctuated wildly, rising sharply after falling. British and American gold pounds also first fell and then rose, eventually rising by one yuan. British gold notes remained unchanged, and the market price stabilized. American gold notes initially retreated to 17.01 yuan, but then steadily rose, eventually reaching 17.225 yuan, an increase of 0.20 yuan compared to the previous day. Demand for Hong Kong notes was also strong, and the market price rose sharply. Demand for Japanese gold notes sharply decreased, and the evening price retreated to 1.575 yuan. The supply and demand for Korean notes was balanced, and the market price stabilized, remaining at 1.33 yuan in the evening.

### Grains: Rice Market Stirs Quietly, Footing Remains Firm

Yesterday, the foreign rice market remained in a state of suppression. However, due to the strict market surveillance, these people were unable to engage in private black market transactions. Those holding goods were still unwilling to sell at high prices. Only general mid-range goods saw some trading. However, those thinking about the market were pessimistic and became less enthusiastic. At the same time, actual sales were cautious, fearing that the market would fall if it did not rise. As a result, prices for all kinds of foreign rice showed no gains or losses, and the trend seemed to be declining.

The arrival of thick and thin japonica rice was still scarce, so the sentiment in the early market was quite firm, and shouts continued to raise prices. However, later, due to the sluggishness of the foreign rice market, prices softened again. As a result, the selling prices can be said to be a fixed position compared to the previous market. Kunshan ho sold white japonica rice for 100 yuan, 99 yuan, and a special 102 yuan. Qingjiao saw thin rice at 91 yuan to 89 yuan.

Although glutinous rice was not subject to restrictions, its use was not widespread, causing both actual stomach and hoarders in the sales field to become inferior. However, there was no intention to loosen the goods, so the selling price was barely held and did not change. If Yili white yuan was 85 yuan, Hong Kong white yuan was a special 85 yuan, a regular 83 yuan, and glutinous tea was 73.5 yuan.

Foreign rice has arrived in Shanghai. The Swire Company's Suiyang vessel, loaded with 1,259 bags from Hong Kong, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning and docked at the Pudong Wharf. It is scheduled to be transferred to the company's wharf on the Bund in the French Concession today for unloading. (Zu)

### Flour Also Trades in the Black Market; A Huge Amount of Foreign Flour Will Arrive in Shanghai

Flour: Yesterday, the foreign flour market was unusually firm. After the Wild Boar and Flower Goddess brands of Australian flour opened at a high price of 22 yuan the day before, speculative hoarders were still excited. However, the Miscellaneous Grain Association, seeing that flour also had speculative manipulation, deeply feared accidents and strictly prohibited buying and selling in the market. As the rice price stabilized slightly, the Flower Bird Clock Tower brand was still heard to be 21.5 yuan, and the Golden brand was 21.34 yuan, and the Triangle brand was 21 yuan, with nearly 10,000 bags traded, all in the over-the-counter market. The Chinese flour factory's price has not changed, but each factory is unable to supply normally due to a shortage of raw materials. It is heard that this matter is still under discussion. It is also heard that a huge amount of foreign flour, a total of about 400,000 bags, will arrive in port around the 20th, at which time the flour price can be lowered.

Wheat: Yesterday, the market was still suppressed. It was found that both domestic and foreign sources were scarce. Japanese and Chinese factories were eager to obtain raw materials, but ultimately regretted that there were no goods to receive. It was heard that yesterday, the Chinese factory received more than 200 bags of Zhongjue wheat, priced at 31 yuan. The selling price of Gao wheat still needs to be increased. The Japanese factory's retail receiving price has not yet been actually released, so there were no goods to receive. The market was as silent as before.

### Securities: Public Bonds Continue to Rise

In the over-the-counter market, public bonds continued to rise yesterday. Class C even broke through 4 yuan, and Class E also broke through 3 yuan. People's hearts were agitated, and retail investors greatly covered their short positions. There was no significant change in the news. However, Xinfu suddenly turned from short to long, and the market turned from weak to strong. It is feared that this will not last. Yesterday morning, Xinfu entered the market again and bought, turning from short to long, and the bulls closed their positions, taking the opportunity to raise prices. The market price was already high in the forenoon. In the afternoon, Xinfu absorbed again, with a total of 800,000 yuan before and after. The 25th bought 300,000 yuan, and Yongchang's entered more than 100,000 yuan. Most of them were closing by bulls, and Yilirun and Lizhenchang sold slightly. As a result, it continued to rise by 0.3-0.4 yuan, with a turnover of 2 million yuan. A brief table is listed below.

In stock trading, 100 shares of the Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company were traded at a price of 18.5 yuan.

The opening of the public industry stock market was quiet, but suddenly turned firm. The public's buying interest in steel stocks was particularly strong. The opening price of the stock was only 32.75 yuan, and it gradually rose to a high price of 36.5 yuan at closing, with a transaction volume of 56,000 shares. Other industrial stocks also made considerable progress. Rubber stocks were also carried up.

London, 17th (Monday) Dispatch: Today's listed prices for Chinese foreign debt and Far East Central Commercial Company stocks. The Far East stocks were slightly active. Jardine Matheson Bank shares rose by 2 shillings and 6 pence, to a price of 8 pounds and 5 shillings. Glugor Rubber shares rose by 1 shilling and 3 pence, to a price of 15 shillings and 7 1/2 pence. The rest were unchanged.

Ayer Tawah Rubber Pays Dividends

Ayer Tawah Rubber Limited, managed by Wah Chang Yangxing, will pay a final dividend of 1.2 yuan per share in national currency for the year ending September 1940, including the interim dividend of 0.2 yuan per share already paid, for a total of 1.4 yuan per share. The thirty-first annual general meeting of shareholders is scheduled to be held on December 27.

### Yarn and Cotton: Double Horse Yarn Reached a New High Price Again in the Afternoon: 1,348 Yuan

The yarn market, which had turned down the previous day, rebounded yesterday. This unpredictable market makes it difficult to grasp. In fact, this is due to the active buying and selling and the high volume of transactions. Thinking about the cotton yarn itself, it should be stable. Unfortunately, the speculative interest in Double Horse yarn is strong, which causes the ups and downs. The current 32-count yarn is quite popular, while 20-count yarn is still being bought. However, some people say that the price of 20-count miscellaneous brand yarn is cheaper than that of Bianma. Today, 270 bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong.

The morning opening of Double Horse was flat due to the decline in popularity the previous day. The initial price was 1,322 yuan. After opening, it slightly fell to 1,318 yuan. At this time, there were quite a few people who were short and bearish. There were three round trips between 1,318 yuan and 1,323 yuan. Then it was heard that foreign exchange had shrunk and gold had risen. The telegrams from general small silver firms were mostly buying orders. A large silver firm was exclusively dragging five or six hundred bales. The temporary table was tight, and general followers chased and entered the market, so the market situation quickly rebounded, and the market became higher and higher. It can be said that it was an inverse proportion to yesterday, rising directly to 1,339 yuan at closing. The total transaction statistics for the day were 5,120 bales. The行情 of 20-count Double Horse rose by 20 yuan. The amount of each helping purchase is listed on the left.

Same trade 4,800 Hong Kong 320

Total 5,120

The market continued to rise in the afternoon. 20-count Double Horse began to trade at 1,341 yuan, and then traded at 1,347-1,348 yuan, with a turnover of 100-200 bales. A new peak was discovered.

### 5,000 Bales of Indian Cotton Arrive; Tianjin Faction Procures Long-Staple Cotton

The current cotton situation remains quiet and not as high as the yarn market. This is because the cotton market has no speculation, and the pricing of foreign cotton is more cost-effective, so the excitement is weak. Moreover, factories have no wholesale purchases.

A large batch of Indian cotton arrived in Shanghai. The British Company's Santhia vessel arrived from Karachi the day before, with a total of 5,175 bales of cotton, and docked at the Qichang warehouse in Pudong for unloading.

Another news item: In the foreign cotton market, the Red Agreement cotton market was slightly active. Later, due to the purchase of colleagues and a part of the short covering, the closing price was one or two pounds higher than the previous day. The Indian market was closed yesterday.

In Shanghai's foreign cotton transactions, Tianjin is quite interested in buying long-staple raw cotton, so customers have started purchasing in Shanghai. However, the factory in this port has a very light purchase intention. The inventory in the market is low, and the exchange rate is tightening, so the future of the cotton market can be bright.

### Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth Rises Sharply in the Afternoon, Especially Fine Cloth

The morning market for factory cloth was flat, but in the afternoon, it was consistently strong. This was due to the tightening of foreign exchange, and colleagues and hoarders were eager to search for cheap goods, and floating households changed their attitude and also moved in, so the selling disk rebounded. Coarse, fine, and twill cloth rose by about 0.25 yuan per foot, bleached and dyed cloth rose by 0.2-0.3 yuan per piece. The factory raised prices because the raw yarn was soaring, and the price after the market also shouted high by 0.25-0.5 yuan. Many orders were placed in the morning according to the original disk of the previous day.

1,400-1,500 pieces of various fabrics were traded in this street. Guangdong and Hong Kong gangs purchased more than 300 pieces of colored cloth, colored twill, bleached cloth, poplin, etc. Zhejiang and Fujian gangs purchased more than 100 pieces of bleached and dyed cloth, coarse cloth, etc. The Beilu Yantai gang purchased more than 100 pieces of heavy coarse cloth spot and futures. Overseas Singapore and other places handled 3,000 pieces of bleached and dyed cloth and printed cloth. Today, 865 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Hong Kong.

Yesterday, Dongbu was tightened by the industry's small purchases from inside and outside. When the market opened in the morning, Longtou fine cloth was 37.3-37.4 yuan, with few sellers and many buyers, and gradually pulled up to 37.75 yuan. At closing, Si Jun thousand billige rose to 1.14 yuan. The mid-range fine cloth brands were firm, rising sharply by 0.5-0.6 yuan.

### Oil Cloth: Speculation in Edible Oil is Rampant—Prices Soaring by 5-6 Yuan—

Yesterday in the oil market, due to the result of general speculative national households failing to deliver the goods for futures settlement (there are still some undecided February), the market absorbed spot oil the next day, so at the beginning of the morning opening, the market was full of buying, and the momentum was more rampant than the previous day. The reason is that in the situation of supply and demand imbalance, the market price is soaring in a straight line. As a result, the volume of transactions is not large, but the market price has soared by 5-6 yuan compared to the previous day. A total of 700 barrels of Dalian soybean oil, 600 dan of Dayouyu factory soybean oil, 80 pieces of Yanyi soybean oil, 50 pieces of Jiaozhou soybean oil, 200 pieces of Jiaozhou raw oil, more than 100 pieces of new goods, 20 pieces of road goods, 60 pieces of Yantai raw oil, 1,000 cans of canned oil, 150 barrels of Qingdao raw oil, and 50 barrels of new goods were traded. The price details are in the market price column.

Exports on the 19th include 1,150 bags of soybeans, 2,550 pieces of soybean cakes, 250 bags of raw peanuts, 320 cans of raw oil, 350 bags of sesame seeds, and 250 cans of sesame oil, all shipped to Hong Kong.

### Sugar Market: Sugar Prices Retract

Yesterday, the sugar market's tightening trend over the past few days has eased, and prices have softened slightly. The association's disk, the spot foreign warehouse 24 coarse white, initially called 75.5 yuan, and later traded at 75.1 yuan, down 0.9 yuan. The January 15th warehouse list was 75.5 yuan, and the Holland cotton white BS mark was 73.8 yuan, up 0.4 yuan. Holland red has risen nearly 4 yuan after the fact, and also eased yesterday. The spot price was 59.2-59.3 yuan to 0.5 yuan, small 0.5 yuan. The end of this month's list was 59.5 yuan, small 0.7 yuan. The Taikoo car white B mark was called 75 yuan, the end of this month's list was 74 yuan, small 1 yuan. The DJ mark was 71.5 yuan, small 0.1 yuan, and the HY mark was 71.3 yuan. The Dong warehouse was 70.07 yuan.

### Silk and Tea: Silk Rises by More Than 70 Yuan

Yesterday, the local silk market was relatively active, and Jardine Matheson and other foreign firms purchased goods, with a total of 60 bales traded. 78% 20.22 條 of white factory silk was sold at 4,725 yuan, which was 75 yuan higher than the previous week's price. The user side did not have a transaction because silk was scarce.

### Coal: Indian Coal Continues to Rise

Indian bituminous coal has recently been in short supply, and the number disk is waiting for a high price. The colleague's dismantling price has been opened to 225 yuan, but they are still unwilling to sell, so yesterday the bank disk has called 230 yuan, which is 10 yuan higher than the previous week's price. The store's sales in this street are 30 yuan per basket, and screened blocks are 240 yuan per ton. It is heard that the dismantling price will continue to increase in the near future due to the continuous rise.

### Financial Statements (Continued from the 16th): Saint Keynes—December 14th—

However, this amendment is by no means beneficial to Japan's wartime finance. It is precisely the phenomenon of Japan's wartime finance and finance collapsing and the currency expanding on a small scale. According to the facts in France, in order to facilitate loans to the government, the maximum limit on the amount of issuance increased with the amount of government loans, so that at first the maximum limit on the amount of issuance was expanded every year, and later it was expanded several times a year. For example, in August 1914, it was expanded to 12 billion francs, in May 1915 to 15 billion, in March 1916 to 18 billion, in February 1917 to 21 billion, and in September to 24 billion, in March 1918 to 27 billion, in May to 30 billion, and in July to 33 billion francs. Now Japan wants to stipulate the maximum annual amount of issuance, will it not be the same as France in 1914-1918, increasing the maximum limit on the amount of issuance in a straight line!

According to observations by Japanese financial figures: the amount of issuance by the Bank of Japan at the end of this year will reach 4 billion. In the face of the fact that the vicious expansion of banknotes in front of our eyes is unstoppable, no high-level financial expert can change it, unless they give up their ambition for aggression!

### China's Direct Taxes

This week, Reuters not only conveyed hints of Japan's financial and monetary straits, but also reported on the direct tax revenue situation in China, a mainstay of the anti-aggression war's finances. It is said that the Chinese government hopes that direct tax revenues from income tax, profit tax, stamp tax, inheritance tax, etc., can reach a total of 135 million yuan next year, and land tax can reach at least 200 million yuan. It is also said that from the beginning of this year to November 28th, income tax revenue was 43.9 million yuan, profit tax was 37 million yuan, stamp tax was 4.7 million yuan, and inheritance tax, although only levied from July 1st, has already collected 2,700 yuan. In recent years, due to military reasons, not much has been published regarding the financial situation, so those who want to study China's wartime finances have been struggling to find suitable information. The author will introduce some of the recent developments in direct taxes in the following commentary.

China's direct taxes are divided into the four taxes mentioned above: income, profit, stamp, and inheritance. Income tax was first levied before the war, starting with the second category of civil servant salary income and the third category of government bond interest income on October 1, 1936. On January 1, 1937, the first category of business profit tax was also levied. The excessive profit tax during the emergency period has been levied since January 1, 1939.

Since the implementation of the income tax, the results have been very satisfactory. The budgeted amount for the 1936 fiscal year was 5 million yuan, but the actual revenue exceeded 6.4 million yuan. The budgeted amount for the 1937 fiscal year was 25 million yuan. Due to the outbreak of the August 13th Incident, China's industry and commerce in the treaty ports suffered great damage, affecting tax revenue. However, the actual revenue was still more than 20 million yuan, accounting for more than 80% of the budgeted amount. In 1938, because China's fiscal year was changed to the calendar year, there were only six months, and the budgeted amount was half of the previous year, totaling 12.5 million yuan. The actual revenue was 8.6 million yuan, accounting for 70% of the budgeted amount. The budgeted amount for 1939 was 30 million yuan, and the actual revenue exceeded 32 million yuan. The budgeted amount for 1940 was 35 million yuan, and according to Reuters, it has already exceeded by 9 million yuan. Currently, among the various national tax revenues, the development of income tax has risen from the sixth position in the 1936 fiscal year to the third position this year, based on the budgeted amount, and is seven times that of 1936.

Among the direct taxes, income tax ranks first, followed by profit tax. The budgeted amount for 1940 was 24 million yuan, but due to the soaring prices during the war, all industries and businesses made money, resulting in strong tax revenue. According to Reuters, it has already exceeded by 13 million yuan.

Next is the stamp tax. The budget for 1940 was more than 10 million yuan, and the inheritance tax was 2 million yuan. Compared with the budgeted amount, the difference is still large. Inheritance tax was only established in July this year, so it is naturally difficult to expect immediate results. As for the reduction in stamp tax, the main reason is still tax evasion. For example, large companies and stores in Shanghai often use the excuse that the stamps are temporarily sold out and add a "no stamps available" stamp on the invoices to evade taxes. It is hoped that all companies and stores can understand that reducing the state's tax revenue by one point will weaken the financial strength of the war of resistance by one point, and increase the pain of being exploited themselves, and make improvements.

### Shanghai Western Extra-Settlement Policing Agreement: Municipal Council Actually Agrees; Formal Signing Almost a Reality; Rumor Has It That Tax Revenue Issues Have Also Been Resolved

According to reliable sources on the foreign side, the Municipal Council has approved the policing agreement established between Major Bogue, Chief Inspector of the Police Force, and Lu Ying. Therefore, the formal signing of the agreement is almost a certainty. At the same time, it is rumored that both parties have also reached a resolution regarding tax revenue in the extra-settlement road area. According to the original regulations, for the area within 100 meters of the public concession border in the extra-settlement road area, the tax revenue would be collected by the Municipal Council. Outside of 100 meters, the tax revenue would be collected by the Chinese side. However, since the fall of the suburbs, this agreement has not been followed, leading to frequent conflicts between the Municipal Council and the "Gao Government" regarding tax revenue issues. Extremists within the "Municipal Government" are advocating for the seizure of the Municipal Council's tax revenue in the extra-settlement road area, but well-informed sources believe that this will not become a reality.

### Yesterday Morning's Lowest Temperature: Below Freezing Point; Weather Forecast Predicts Warming Trend

According to the report from the Xujiahui Observatory, the lowest temperature at dawn yesterday had fallen to 3.1 degrees Celsius below freezing point, or 26.4 degrees Fahrenheit, marking the first day of extreme cold this year. Ice has begun to appear in the ditches. The north wind is strong and biting, and the cold is extraordinary. Pedestrians on the street all appear to be shrinking from the cold. Furthermore, it is reported that Qingdao experienced snowfall the day before yesterday. Although it was sunny yesterday, the extreme cold was even more severe than in Shanghai. This cold front was caused by a sudden westward advance of a high-pressure system from Siberia towards Shanghai. Now that the cold front has only reached the lower reaches of the Yangtze River and the Shanghai area, it will soon head east out to sea. According to the observatory's predictions, this cold weather will warm up in the days after the high-pressure system passes Shanghai. Because the weather is clear and crisp, there will be no rain or snow. As for the hurricane that recently occurred in the Pacific Ocean, it is showing signs of dissipation and will not strike Shanghai. It is reported that the Tongren Fuyuan Branch of the French Concession has received reports from various police stations and shops, residents, and the morgue, stating that a total of twenty-six adult corpses and sixty-three juvenile corpses of those who froze to death have been collected over the past two days. The majority of the adult corpses are those who were addicted to opium.

### Rice Industry Organization: Public Warehouse Committee Holds First Meeting Yesterday

The establishment of public warehouses in Shanghai to store 200,000 bags of grain, in order to ensure the people's food supply, has been initiated. Currently, the rice industry has pledged 50,000 bags, the silver and money industry has pledged 50,000 bags, and Mr. Yu Qiaqing has pledged 50,000 bags. It is rumored that the remaining 50,000 bags have been pledged by the flour, yarn, flower, and metal industries. The "Rice Industry Public Warehouse Grain Storage Committee" has been established, and twenty-nine members have been appointed, including Chen Ziyi, Xing Zhigang, Zhu Zixiang, She Bingwen, Zhou Zhizhen, Zhang Lizhong, Fu Qian'geng, Jiang Hongbin, Yang Heqing, Chen Shide, Yan Jiyun, Liu Liugu, and He Quanzhuang. A first committee meeting was held yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM at the Douchi Industry Association hall on the third floor of 15 Edward Road. However, although the rice market is monitored by a supervisory group organized by the management committee to oversee trading among industry members, the market price limits were still broken yesterday. It is unknown what the management committee thinks about this.

### Beggar Reception Center: To Be Completed Within the Year; 25 Buildings with Comprehensive Facilities; Capacity for 2,000 People; Vocational Training and Education to Be Provided; Salvation Army Invited the Press to Visit Yesterday

With the soaring prices in the city, the number of impoverished people becoming beggars is increasing daily. With the arrival of this harsh winter, their lives are endangered by exposure to the cold and starvation. This is a serious problem for society. The Salvation Army in the city, recognizing this, has specially established a beggar reception center as a solution. In addition to cooperating, the Municipal Council has generously lent land. Construction began on the first day of this month and is now mostly completed. The leaders of the Salvation Army specially invited the press in the city to visit the site at Singapore Road and Hardoon Road at 10:30 AM yesterday. The Director of the Health Department of the Municipal Council and other dignitaries also visited in person, creating a very enthusiastic atmosphere.

Most of the Project Completed

The site of the reception center is very spacious, covering approximately 15 and a half mu. When reporters arrived, the area was filled with the sounds of construction, as 100 workers were working hard to build it. Currently, 18 dormitories have been built, arranged in six rows, which is very neat. The walls are made of woven bamboo strips, and the roofs are made of reed mats and fir wood, coated with asphalt to protect against rain and snow. Each building is 18 feet high, 10 feet wide, and 50 feet long, with a row of double and single-layer bamboo beds inside, accommodating 75 people. There are still seven buildings to be built, requiring 20,000-30,000 yuan.

Beggar Reception Center

The beggar reception center, organized by the Salvation Army, is located at the corner of Singapore Road and Hardoon Road, covering 15 and a half mu. Eighteen temporary buildings have already been completed and the total project is expected to be completed by the end of the month. The picture shows a portion of the reception center.

All School Site Borrowed

Next to the reception center was originally a Municipal Council elementary school. Because the site was insufficient, the Municipal Council specially lent the entire elementary school site. The elementary school will relocate at the end of this month. The elementary school buildings are intended to be used as offices for the reception center and an attached hospital, and a portion will be used as rain showers and kitchens. Currently, construction is underway. A corner of the elementary school playground has also been designated for the construction of classrooms and an auditorium. The perimeter of the site has been enclosed with a tall bamboo fence to prevent beggars from escaping.

Medical Treatment, Disease Prevention, and Education to Be Provided

According to Salvation Army leader Ma Ruishan yesterday, the beggar reception center will be completed by the end of this month, and the Municipal Council will capture approximately 2,000 beggars and send them to the center. It will be officially established on New Year's Day next year. When beggars enter the center, each person will be given two quilts and a set of cotton clothes. They will also undergo physical examinations to treat their illnesses and addictions. A workshop is planned within the center, divided into towel, leather shoe, weaving, and sewing departments, to enable older beggars to learn productive skills. Those who are illiterate and child beggars will also attend classes every day to be taught and instilled with knowledge so that they can become useful people. The cost of food is approximately 5 jiao 5 fen per person per day for two meals. It is reported that the opening expenses and funds for the reception center come from the Municipal Council, but the ongoing maintenance costs will be covered by public donations. Forty percent of the entertainment tax revenue of the Public Concession has been allocated to the Salvation Army as funds for the beggar reception center.

It was learned yesterday that the employers have now agreed to double the payment until the end of the year. Workers in the finishing department made the same request, which was also agreed upon by the employers.

Garment Industry Work Stoppage Yesterday

The city's garment industry (i.e., clothing stores) employees, numbering over two thousand, jointly went on strike yesterday morning at 8 a.m. due to soaring prices and meager monthly salaries that made it impossible to maintain a livelihood. They elected representatives to present ten demands for improved treatment to the employers, requesting a response. As a result, clothing stores along Fujian Road were closed yesterday, with all employees remaining in their respective stores, awaiting a resolution to the labor dispute. There are approximately 300 clothing stores in the city, with the largest concentration, 64 stores, located on Fujian Road, followed by over 30 stores on Xinzha Road, over 10 stores on Route Robert, over 20 stores in Caojiadu, and several dozen stores each on Caishi Road, North Henan Road, and Xujiahui. The labor side made ten demands for the 2,000-plus employees: (1) Recognition of the Employees' Association. (2) Employees should not be dismissed without cause; in special circumstances, one month's severance pay should be provided. (3) The minimum salary should be increased to 16 yuan, with a monthly allowance of 2 yuan. (4) The commission should be increased from 2.5% to 4%. (5) The commission on each piece should range from one dime to two, four dimes, etc. (6) Solicitation should not exceed three hours. (7) Solicitation should cease during windy and rainy weather. (8) Abolish the system of liability for damaged goods. (9) Employees should be transferred at the end of the sixth month of the lunar calendar.

Yesterday afternoon at 2 p.m., representatives from the labor side and three representatives from the employer side began negotiations. The employer side urged the labor side to resume work first, stating that they would consider the conditions before making a decision. The labor side indicated that if the employer side agreed to improve treatment, there would be no problem with resuming work first. The two sides were very close to an agreement, and a resolution should be reached soon.

Conditions of Mow Tai Workers

The thousand-plus drivers and laborers of Mow Tai Foreign Firm's Shanghai Branch submitted a petition to the firm yesterday, represented by representatives, due to high rice prices and the approaching year-end, which made it difficult to make ends meet. They also presented demands for improved treatment. The Chinese manager, Mr. Song, received them and promised to consider their requests, urging the workers to await a response patiently.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Improves Treatment; Low-Paid Employees Benefit; Minimum Monthly Wage for Public Servants is Seventy-Two Yuan; Police Officers Can Earn at Least One Hundred and Nine Yuan

According to the Shanghai Municipal Council's information, this decision to adjust employee treatment will significantly improve the income of general lower-level employees. For example, "Two public servants with a base salary of seventeen yuan can receive a temporary cost-of-living allowance of at least forty yuan, plus a rice subsidy of at least fifteen yuan, for a total monthly income of at least seventy-two yuan. If rice prices rise, their income will increase further. When the price of No. 2 tribute rice is eighty-one yuan and fifty cents, the rice subsidy will be twenty-three yuan and twenty-five cents, so the total monthly income will be eighty yuan and twenty-five cents. As for police officers, because their duties are special, their treatment is even better. Each police officer can now earn at least one hundred and nine yuan per month."

Year-End Approaching; Wage Increases in Various Industries

Recently, the Industrial and Social Affairs Bureau published a worker income index, stating that Chinese-owned factories are making great efforts to adjust employee salaries. Worker income this year is double that of last year. It is rumored that many employers have followed the council's example and will further adjust wages as the year-end approaches.

### U.S. Second Round-the-World Liner to Arrive in Shanghai Next Spring; Named President Monroe; Same Type as the President Jackson

The first of the U.S. Mail Steamship Company's new round-the-world liners, the President Jackson, arrived in Shanghai on her maiden voyage on the 12th of this month and departed on the 13th for Hong Kong, Luzon, and various ports in the South Seas before returning to the United States.

It is scheduled to set sail in mid-January next year and arrive in port on February 5, where it will stay for one day. The next day, it will take the route through Hong Kong, Manila, Singapore, and India, around the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa, across the Atlantic Ocean, and return to New York.

### After Nomura's Assassination, Japanese Authorities Search Villages; Claim Gunman Still Hiding in the Countryside

After the shooting of Japanese Army Medical Captain Nomura Masao at the intersection of Tangpeng Road and Huade Road in Hongkou on the afternoon of the 16th, the Japanese authorities conducted a major search for the perpetrator in the Hongkou district, but have not yet apprehended the actual gunman. The Japanese authorities believe that the perpetrator is still hiding in the nearby countryside, as the shooter fled into Dongji Ning Road along Jilin Road and then disappeared. There are several small villages near that road, and it is rumored that the Japanese military police have dispatched teams to search the area. According to the Japanese authorities, when the incident occurred, Army Medical Second Lieutenant Nomura, along with Corporal Takahashi, four translators, a female nurse, and two servants, were giving injections at the scene. A man suddenly emerged from behind Nomura and fired two shots at him, penetrating his abdomen from the back. The shooter is approximately fourteen or fifteen years old.

It is said that the Japanese authorities are remaining silent about the arrest of the assassin "in order to capture other members who are connected to the terrorist group."

### Sixth Similarity Between Confucianism and Buddhism: Explaining the Essence of Wisdom; Said to be Witnessing Truth without Attachment

The Sixth Buddhist Lecture of the Rong Wu Society was given by Mr. Chuan 先, who discussed the similarities between Buddhism and Confucianism. His speech was published in this newspaper previously. In addition to Mr. Chuan's lecture on that day, Mr. Yang Zhongyi also lectured on the sixth point of similarity between Confucianism and Buddhism, which is the sixth of the Six Paramitas, specifically Prajna Paramita. Prajna in Chinese means wisdom, which is witnessing the truth without attachment, that is, awakening to one's nature, naturally understanding virtue, and being the unobscured essence. According to Buddhist scriptures and treatises, it can be further divided into four aspects.

The Principle of Prajna

The Zhi Du Lun says about Prajna: "Of all wisdom, it is the first, the highest, incomparable, unequal, and unsurpassed. It is even more unsurpassed." The Bodhisattva in the Diamond Sutra gatha says, "Spreading treasures throughout three thousand worlds, and holding them as fields of merit, only creates conditioned karma, and does not depart from the realms of humans and gods. Holding the Sutra and taking four verses creates good affinity with the saints, but to enter the sea of suffering, one must use the boat of Prajna." The Great Learning says, "Manifesting virtue throughout the world," repeatedly citing the sentence "manifesting virtue" from the imperial classics of the Great Declaration and the Kang Declaration, concluding by saying, "It all comes from self-manifestation." One must first manifest one's own virtue and then extend it to the utmost, so that all people in the world can manifest their own manifested virtue. Therefore, Mahayana Bodhisattvas vow to universally liberate all sentient beings and must first ride the boat of Prajna themselves.

The Characteristics of Prajna

The Manjushri Sutra says, "To abide in Prajna Paramita is to not abide in any dharma, to not abide in any characteristic," "Not seeing any dharma that can be taken or abandoned, nor seeing Nirvana as pleasurable, nor birth and death as hateful," "Practicing Prajna Paramita in this way, one does not see defilements that can be abandoned, nor does one see merits that can be taken." Dharma has no good or bad, because it is apart from all characteristics. Dharma has no high or low, because it has an equal nature. Dharma has no taking or abandoning, because it abides in reality. The Tathagata's perfect enlightenment is self-witnessing emptiness." "When practicing Prajna Paramita, one does not see the characteristics of ordinary people, nor the characteristics of the Buddhadharma, nor the characteristics of the certain existence of all dharmas, nor the desire realm, nor the form realm, nor the formless realm, nor the realm of quiescence, nor the characteristic of the extinction of all dharmas." "Not seeing bondage, not seeing liberation, and not seeing any difference between ordinary people and even the three vehicles, such is Prajna." Prajna is apart from all verbal characteristics, so Heaven does not speak, and Confucius wanted to be silent. "I have nothing to hide from you," yet Zigon sighed that it could not be heard. The sages showed it with their actions and deeds. "The superior man is reverent in his repose, trustworthy in his silence, and the people are encouraged without rewards, and fear without anger." What characteristics can be obtained? The Book of Odes says, "I cherish bright virtue, without loud sounds or colors," and "The music that ascends is without words," and "Do not reveal virtue," and all officials emulate it, so "Sincere respect makes the world peaceful." Zhu Xi said, "Soundless and odorless is the ultimate of non-manifestation," and its meaning deeply resonates with its subtlety. Manjushri Bodhisattva said about Prajna, "Not seeing birth and death, much less loathing or departing." This is the way of the superior man, "Plain and unwearying," and its ultimate is, "Knowing the nearness of the distant, knowing the origin of the wind, and knowing the manifestation of the subtle, one can enter into virtue." The "entering into virtue" of the Doctrine of the Mean is the "manifesting virtue" of the Great Learning.

The Practice of Prajna

If you want to discard the boat of Prajna, you must cultivate the practice of Prajna. If you want to cultivate the practice of Prajna, you must arouse the Bodhi mind. The Flower Adornment Sutra says, "Constantly using this mind to rescue and protect all sentient beings, arousing the Bodhi mind without ceasing," "First, one should abide in the Bodhi mind, and then cultivate all the Buddhadharmas," "The Bodhi mind is like a diamond, the ignorant cannot know it, the unskillful cannot understand it, and the incapable cannot use it." The Bodhi mind cannot be held by the hearers and pratyekabuddhas. "Only those who are interested in Prajna can hold it." This is the "for three months, the heart does not depart from benevolence" that is difficult to achieve. Bodhi is translated as "path," and the new translation is "awakening." Arousing the Bodhi mind is the mind of the path, the mind of awakening. The perilous subtlety between the two is what the sages revere. Confucius told Zeng Shen and Zisi, "My way is one, penetrating all." The "yes" of Zeng Zi is the gradual teaching of the Sage Gate. Yan Hui's "not understanding as if foolish" is the complete teaching of the Sage Gate. The Book of Mencius says, "Heaven gives birth to these people so that the first to awaken will awaken those who are later to awaken. I am one of the first to awaken among Heaven's people, and I will use this path to awaken these people. If it is not me who awakens them, then who will?" "He takes on the responsibility for all under heaven in this way." Therefore, it is said that "It is people who expand the path, not the path that expands people." The "following one's nature and cultivating the path" of the Doctrine of the Mean is the practice of Prajna.

The Benefits of Prajna

The Upasaka Precepts Sutra says, "A layperson who arouses the Bodhi mind is superior to all pratyekabuddha fruits." The Moonlight Samadhi Sutra says, "The Buddha said, 'If there are Bodhisattvas who practice Prajna, there are ten kinds of benefits," even "ten dislikes of the path of hearers and pratyekabuddhas." The Doctrine of the Mean says, "Sincerity is the self-completion of the one who is sincere, and the path is the self-path of the path," "It is not only to complete oneself, but also to complete things," "Completing oneself is benevolence, and completing things is wisdom. This is the virtue of nature." Mencius pitied "Those who follow it for a lifetime and do not know its path are the masses," so he said, "What the superior man is born with, benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom are rooted in the heart," "Great acts do not increase, and living in poverty does not diminish," "Those who exhaust their hearts know their nature, preserve their hearts, nourish their nature, do not waver in premature death or long life, and cultivate themselves while waiting," "Poverty does not lose righteousness, cultivating oneself in solitude, and success does not depart from the path, benefiting all under heaven." This is the Mahayana Bodhisattva's grand vow and power to liberate all sentient beings, therefore "Only the ultimate sincerity in the world can exhaust the nature of people and things, praise and nurture the creation of heaven and earth, and participate with heaven and earth."

It is said that the next lecture will be on the 20th, given by Mr. Shen Daling, discussing the similarities between the five religions.

News and Music Still Disrupted Yesterday

When China United Broadcasting Station broadcast on the registered wavelength of 600 kilocycles and the temporary wavelength of 640 kilocycles on the evening of the 17th and yesterday morning, it was subjected to strong interference, especially during Mr. Alcott's daily four news broadcasts. The interference continued during the afternoon broadcasts of music and German news. It is generally believed that the disruption of China United Broadcasting Station's broadcasts is orchestrated by the Japanese Radio Management Office in this city. In the past few months, the management office has tried to force most radio stations to limit their power to 200 watts. Those who do not comply with this "request" are disrupted, to the point where all radio stations have to accept the Japanese "request."

French Radio Station Maintains Status Quo

Before the Shanghai Municipal Council election this year, both the Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury radio station (call sign XMHC) and China United Broadcasting Station were disrupted when broadcasting news. The French radio station (call sign FFZ) in this city has also been interfered with recently because it refused to comply with the Japanese request to reduce its power. However, the French radio station has maintained its normal power, and the disruption has decreased in recent days.

Yesterday (the 18th), Japanese authorities supervised over 200 Chinese workers to rush the construction of a new road from the middle section of Great Western Road, the site where Japanese military policeman Saito was assassinated about three weeks ago, to connect to Great Western Road, and to name it "Saito Road." The original site of the new road was Wangjia Lane, which will be widened and extended. The Chinese residences on both sides will be mostly demolished. It is estimated that about 2,000 Chinese people whose houses will be demolished.

### Japanese Trucks Forcibly Drive Through Wire Mesh

According to the North China Daily News, the British military authorities stationed in Shanghai agreed with the Japanese military authorities months ago that the wire mesh barriers erected on North Xizang Road would be closed daily from midnight to 4 a.m. Since the implementation, there have been no changes. However, at 12:40 a.m. yesterday (the 17th), five Japanese trucks loaded with vegetables suddenly arrived at the scene. Disregarding the above-mentioned agreement between the British and Japanese authorities, they arbitrarily cut open the wire mesh and allowed the vehicles to pass through, transporting vegetables to the Japanese-controlled "New Central Market" next to the road. The police officers on duty at the scene objected, but were unable to stop them. The authorities are currently considering the possibility of protesting to the Japanese authorities regarding this matter, but it is not yet certain whether a protest will be lodged.

### Major Robbery at Dajicheng Fur Store, Two Key Suspects Arrested: Dismissed Apprentice Conspired with Gang to Plan Fraud and Robbery, Offering Stolen Goods to Wing On Fur Store Led to Case Being Solved

Chen Xun (22 years old), a dismissed apprentice from Ningbo at Dajicheng Fur Store located at 347 Henan Road, recently associated with bandits. On the afternoon of October 16th of this year, in collusion with Hu Tingjie from Jiangbei and Shen Zhigao and others still at large, they checked into Room 430 of the Yangzi Hotel at the intersection of Yunnan Road and Third Racecourse Road, posing as the owner of the Weiya Restaurant. They called Dajicheng and requested the delivery of

A Large Quantity of Fur Goods

to the room for selection and purchase. The store believed them to be regular customers and suspected nothing. They dispatched two employees, Zhang Jieshuo and another, to deliver an otter fur coat, a lynx fur robe, two sable furs, three gray back furs, and one sea otter fur, with a total value of 33,220 yuan. Upon arrival at the room, they were immediately threatened with guns by the bandits inside and bound and gagged with prepared ropes and cotton in the bathroom, while the fur goods were

Entirely Robbed.

After the incident, the manager of Dajicheng reported the case to the police for investigation. On October 31st, the gang instructed Chen Xun to take the sea otter fur, worth 10,300 yuan, to Wing On Fur Store located at 16 Mintini Road for sale. The shareholders of the store, Lu Ronghua and Dai Shaoting, suspected that the goods were of unknown origin and dared not accept them in the store. Both parties agreed to negotiate in Room 33 of the Carter Hotel on Carter Road, offering 1,600 yuan to buy the fur goods worth over 10,000 yuan. Subsequently, the case was discovered by the Old Zha

Police Station.

It was discovered that the bandit Hu Tingjie danced at the Laoda Hua Ballroom on Marlborough Road every night. A police informant was taken to identify him, and Hu was arrested first. Subsequently, Chen Xun and two receivers of stolen goods were arrested. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the First Special Court for formal prosecution according to law.

They claimed that someone had reported it to the headquarters, and they were assigned to investigate. The shop owner, Zhang Wenbao, was anxious and asked for a way to avoid prosecution. Zhang and Liu then claimed that to help with this matter, they would need a reward of at least 150 yuan. After negotiation, Zhang agreed to pay 100 yuan to settle the matter. Eighty yuan was paid that day, and fifteen yuan was paid on the 13th, with five yuan still owing. Yesterday, Liu and others went to collect the remaining payment, but Zhang saw through their impersonation and reported it to the police station, who arrested Zhang and Liu. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special Court and prosecuted for fraud. A request was made for a change of date, and Judge Huang presided over the hearing. The defendants denied posing as detectives to defraud money, claiming that the plaintiff was harboring thieves and asked them to find a way to request exemption from prosecution at the headquarters. After reviewing the facts, the court ordered another hearing.

### The Attitude Towards Reading Classical Chinese

— Xu Daming

I remember when I was a child, "on the first day of school, the child's family had to prepare things like sugar tea cakes and biscuits, and take them to the teacher's 'private school', first offering them to Confucius, and then sharing them with the classmates, so everyone would get to know each other." Although I didn't go through this "ceremony" of "baptism", it is still being performed in the "village schools" in my hometown. The books we started reading were nothing more than "Prodigy Poems", "Thousand Character Classic", "Three Character Classic", "Hundred Family Surnames" and the like. So as long as you are a child who crosses the threshold of the school, there is no one who does not know Confucius. Therefore, it is no wonder people say "Before Confucius, there was no Confucius: After Confucius, there are countless Confucius."

But why do we have to talk about Confucius when we talk about Classical Chinese? Undoubtedly, Confucius is the authority of Chinese classical literature, and the representative of feudal culture. Therefore, when we talk about Classical Chinese, we cannot completely separate ourselves from Confucius. In other words, when we talk about Classical Chinese today, we should pay attention to the social conditions at that time. The current socio-economic structure of China is in a capitalist-oriented semi-feudal situation. Similarly, the political form based on economic conditions has not jumped out of this circle. Therefore, the phenomenon expressed in the cultural field also has this common tendency. Therefore, before the economic base is improved and the political system is refreshed, feudal culture cannot be eradicated. What's more, there are still people who are still singing the praises of "restoring the old" and "reading the classics" in order to "protect themselves wisely," and "pouring oil" on the flames of "driving backwards."

But, we are not saying that "Classical Chinese is useless", but that Classical Chinese cannot be applied to the masses. As for the specialized research of a few people, we do not object either. At the same time, we are not saying that we should be passive, and should keep our mouths shut and not speak. We still have to speak, unless we are forced to be mutes. In fact, even if we are mute, we can still use gestures, and our lips can still move. Therefore, we still have to think positively—how to create the new culture that our era needs. This is the responsibility of our young people. This is to say how to give full play to the uniqueness of the culture itself—to shoulder the responsibility of the times, and to promote the progress of the political system and help the improvement of economic conditions. The two have a reciprocal relationship!

Similarly, when we want to understand Classical Chinese today, and understand the teachings of Confucius, we should have two firm positions: First, we should clearly recognize the difference between the era in which Confucius was born and the era in which we live. Confucius' era was an era in which feudal economy was maturing—the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods—so the culture at that time also needed to be promoted to a stage that was adapted to the economic form. China has now been pushed from a semi-feudal society to a new democratic era by the flames of the War of Resistance, so the cultural sector also needs to be promoted to an advanced stage. Therefore, the task of cultural workers today is to work hard to create a new culture of new democracy, so that it can adapt to the great era of anti-Japanese war. This creative work of culture can be said to be the commonality between Confucius and modern cultural workers in different eras. If we still blindly adhere to the old rules and maintain the old forms of feudal culture—singing praises of "reading the classics", etc.—it seems that we are respecting Confucius in form, but in reality, we are greatly violating the spirit of Confucius, and treating Confucius as an "idol". Conversely, if we do not adhere to the old rules and create a new culture that adapts to the needs of the new era, then, in form, it seems that we are running counter to Confucius, but in reality, we are truly in line with the spirit of Confucius.

Second, we should look at Confucius's teachings with a developing rather than a rigid perspective, and accept the "heritage" of history with rational criticism, retaining or promoting what is good (if it is worth promoting), and simply discarding what is harmful, which is not worth cherishing. As for trying to bring out Confucius's last teachings, and use a few words to treat them as the content to teach the public, it is just a shallow attempt, which has nothing to do with promoting the spirit of Confucius, and is not suitable for the current needs of China. If Confucius is regarded as a puppet in Chinese history to implement enslavement education, it is not only a distortion of Confucius, but also a slander of Confucius, becoming a sinner of Confucius.

Therefore, to "reprint" the Classical Chinese of that time in its original form today and implement enslavement education, the intention is vicious, but the fact of "borrowing a corpse to revive the soul" that we have already seen is spreading day by day. Therefore, it is by no means a meaningless thing to talk about our position and attitude towards Classical Chinese and the teachings of Confucius today.

Tianru said very proudly: "This is their own talent, what credit do I have? Now that I have Shangshu's words, it is like ascending the Dragon Gate, and the reputation has increased tenfold. I also have to ask Shangyi to bestow a few poems on them as a sign of honor." Qian Muzhai smiled slightly and said, "I have just improvised a few poems, and I will send a few more lyrics tomorrow." Liu Rushi then presented the poems written by Muzhai to Zhang Tianru to read. Tianru recited them loudly and praised them with admiration, saying: "These are the works of Li Bai and Du Fu, and others would put down their pens if they were to write them." The Liu sisters each sang a song again, and they drank until late at night. The banquet ended and the lights were extinguished before they dispersed and went home. Muzhai visited Rushi's boudoir again the next day, and gave Liu Rushi a few new lyrics, which Liu Rushi thanked him endlessly for. Accompanying Qian Muzhai, they talked about ancient and modern times, and deeply admired Muzhai's extensive knowledge of history, and had many insights that she had never heard of. After a while, Huang Yuqi came to tell Liu Rushi that Shi Da had already sent a letter to him through him to Jinling to see Hou Fangyu, and then asked Hou Fangyu to send a letter to Shi Da to take to Wuchang, to join Zuo Liangyu's command—to make contributions, and gave him twenty taels of travel expenses. Shi Da had already set off, and asked him to tell her that he would not come to say goodbye. Liu Rushi felt relieved when she heard this news. That night, she accompanied Qian and Huang in her boudoir to drink. No other guests were invited, and Jiang Zi also went out to entertain guests. The three of them drank and talked, each expressing their inner thoughts. After two watches, Huang Yuqi wanted to go home. Xian Muzhai was infatuated with Liu Rushi at first sight, and was reluctant to get up. Liu Rushi did not feel anything, but she already had Chen Wozi in her heart, and she only had respect for Qian Muzhai and no love. Muzhai saw that Liu Rushi did not show any expression, and knew that she was a famous courtesan with a reputation. Although he loved her, it would not be a matter of a day or two to win the favor of the beauty. Therefore, he had to bid farewell to Huang Yuqi. The intention of love was seen by even Xu Da Niang. Xu Da Niang knew that Qian Muzhai was a noble person, and was different from Zhang Tianru. She hoped that Rushi could marry a rich man so that she could get a large sum of money to provide for her old age. But Liu Rushi's heart was still attached to Chen Wozi. Although she was a flower that had fallen into the mire, she was born with wisdom, valued her reputation, admired scholars, and was a very righteous woman. Qian Muzhai admired Songling and came twice, pouring out poetry and wine. It could not be said that he did not have any affection for her. Liu Rushi admired Qian Muzhai's articles very much, so she thought over and over again, wanting to test whether Chen Wozi had true feelings for her, and then came up with a humorous and absurd trick to use as a touchstone for Chen Wozi.

"We are called into the world not entirely for banquets and feasts, we are here to fight, therefore, we must not forget for a moment that we have entered the battlefield. There, and should not only pick the less dangerous places; should like a good soldier, put everything we have into the place where the fight is most fierce." - Guo Ge Mai.

— Jianyun

It's so cold, early in the morning

Run on an empty stomach!

Sitting in the office

Waiting for the time.

Dragging over the newspaper:

"...Wheat noodles rise in price..."

"...White rice is very high..."

The bell rings, walk into the classroom:

"Now His Majesty has the jade of Kunshan, with the reality of harmony..."

Alas! My stomach is "growling"!

Twelve o'clock strikes,

Dizzy, go home.

The wife frowns:

"There's only two mao left, how can we?"

The son cries:

"Dad! Not full!"

Regardless of these, pick up the thin porridge and pour it into my mouth!

I say, brother:

"It's not worth suffering.

Why don't you want money?"

Answer you:

"Losing integrity is a big deal, starving to death is a small matter!"

### Learning from "Confucius"

— Jiangcheng

The film "Confucius" gives us satisfaction beyond the usual level. Confucius left us lessons that transcend time. No one can escape the constraints of time and space, but great philosophers often have the awareness and ability to see ahead.

We cannot know what people more than two thousand four hundred years from now will think of us; we cannot become "perfect people" that far into the future in the present. Similarly, we cannot fully measure Confucius of two thousand four hundred years ago with modern standards. Given the amazing speed of human progress, we who live today are truly small and weak. It would be excessive to have endless demands of Confucius from more than two thousand years ago.

We also cannot blindly accept everything about Confucius, just as we do not sympathize with those suffering from a general "enthusiastic immaturity" who blindly try to tear down the Confucian establishment.

What we admire about Confucius is that he was a great philosopher, not because he was a great politician. If we ask, "Why didn't Confucius lead the people to overthrow the autocratic rulers?" it would be better to ask, "Why didn't Confucius promote the Industrial Revolution when he was rich?" After all, the establishment of the Republic of China was only twenty-nine years ago.

Later generations have "suppressed, exaggerated, distorted, slandered, and used" Confucius to an unknown extent. We should no longer harbor the idea of "using" him; we should try to understand and study this ancient philosopher and great scholar, which is more valuable than blindly praising certain celebrities.

Although Confucius himself admitted that he failed politically, it was only a strategic failure (Hitler was a strategic victor, and...). He almost wanted to use the rebellious political opportunity to promote the way of benevolence and righteousness, but it was only a case of "the Master wanted to go," but he did not go. One cannot forget the fundamentals by only focusing on the goal and disregarding the means. At the same time, when he was the magistrate of Zhongdu, the Minister of Public Works, and the Minister of Justice, he also had some political achievements in leading some of the people to do good. Because he always took "benevolence and righteousness as the foundation," the feudal lords would yawn when they heard it. If he had said, "I can fight a battle for you, my lord, and secure the world," the feudal lords would have jumped up long ago. However, for "repelling strong enemies and punishing traitors," his methods were quite ruthless.

"Where sincerity penetrates, metal and stone are opened." A spirit of reckless abandon can produce unexpected power. Just as a soldier kills several enemies on the battlefield and seizes a machine gun with his bare hands, the power that dominates when doing impossible things is often the power of the spirit. We cannot deny Confucius's spiritual teachings.

He was attacked by the people of Kuang in Kuang, attacked by the people of Song in Song, unable to be employed in Lu, unable to be employed in Wei. He could not enter Zheng, he could not enter Jin, the trees were cut down to show danger, and food was cut off in Chen and Cai. Confucius traveled throughout his life, and although he did not have remarkable achievements, Confucius never yielded, he was neither killed nor did he die of cold and starvation. Although his demeanor was stern and somewhat annoying, "death cannot be avoided" and "not sitting improperly" are not bad things after all.

Using films, especially dramatic films, to depict the deeds of a philosopher or inventor can often only capture the spirit. If you really want to explain a theory, it is better to abandon the film and turn to books. After watching "Young Tom Edison" and "Edison, the Man," you still don't know the principle of the electric light; after watching "The Story of Louis Pasteur," you don't understand how Pasteur's vaccine works; after watching "The Magic Bullet," you are still confused about the principle of "Salvarsan." This is not surprising. The same is true for the film "Confucius," and we cannot have excessive demands. However, only excellent works are worthy of serious criticism and worthy of future hope. We should not miss the opportunity to appreciate Confucius, and we should not abandon the responsibility to criticize. But everything that is serious and uplifting will naturally produce a sense of respect and love, just as we hate things that are base and vulgar.

### The Making of the Film "Confucius"

— Fei Mu

— Regarding the Actors

One point worth mentioning about the film "Confucius" is the outstanding performance of the actors. This is an honor for the Shanghai acting community, not my own pride. Standing in the position of a director, to avoid suspicion, it is inconvenient to praise them as much as I want; but the audience will naturally feel it.

In addition to the old Lianhua comrades who have shared hardships for many years, such as Mr. Zhang Yi, Mr. Sima Yingcai, and Mr. Pei Chong, we also obtained:

Mr. Xu Li and Miss Murong Wan'er from the Shanghai Drama Society; Miss Chen Qi and Mr. Tu Guangqi and Mr. Qian Qian from the New Art Troupe; Mr. Tang Huaiqiu and Mr. Li Jingbo, Mr. Ge Xin, Mr. Wu Jingping, and Mr. Tang Qi from the China Travel Troupe; as well as the participation of many enthusiastic colleagues. The cast of the film "Confucius" was truly a selection of the best of the time, which was unexpected at first.

What kind of power could have obtained such widespread support and sympathy is truly inspiring. Moreover, not only those who participated in the work, but several other friends who sought to participate still came to ask me before the last scene of "Confucius" was filmed: "Do you still need people?"

Not caring about remuneration is just the nature of artists, but they even did not compete for roles, regardless of fame or decision, regardless of the plot, regardless of the amount of acting, and completely trusted me. They were all busy people, but when notified today, they would arrive on time tomorrow. Such a work attitude is truly rare. How can I respond to such enthusiasm?

In the character list of "Confucius", they are all actors. If they were called according to the usual term, each one would be a "guest star." The reason is that they work for the sake of work, and each is a 100% dedicated actor—worthy of the word "actor." Calling them "guest stars" would be a commercialized gimmick" and an insult to the artists.

Due to the limitations of the script, they were not given the opportunity to fully showcase their acting skills, which is truly a pity. Especially for Miss Murong Wan'er and Miss Chen Qi.

The production time of "Confucius" was too long, and many of their screen works (initial decisions) have already been performed in films that were shot after "Confucius," and their talents and acting skills have been proven. This can slightly cover up my sins.

One thing that makes me very excited is that most of the actors who participated this time were initial attempts, and the excellent results they showed were by no means inferior to seasoned veterans. On the other hand, Mr. Zhang Yi, Mr. Sima Yingcai, and Mr. Pei Chong did not show any weakness or inferiority in front of their fellow actors, and were worthy of being "stars." Such cooperation and coordination had never happened before.

Mr. Xu Li, Mr. Tu Guangqi, and Mr. Li Jingbo also often inspired me to revise the dialogue during filming, which is very grateful.

Regarding Mr. Tang Huaiqiu: He has shaped the imagined Confucius into a vivid, fleshy, and character-filled figure. Just the more than thirty times of makeup, six hours each time, the kind of tenacity and perseverance in being loyal to art is enough to be a model for actors.

Finally, I must thank all the actors, including the "extras" who have always been neglected. The so-called "extras" are just that their names are not on any film company's payroll; among them, there is no shortage of real talent. In "Confucius," there are several scenes that are entirely done by "extras," which I deliberately designed, and I believe the audience will not be able to tell.

Please forgive me for not saying a word criticizing the actors. In fact, the entire film is made by the actors, so how can it escape anyone's eyes?
