### Soviet Labor Newspaper Comments on the Sino-Japanese War: Japanese Forces Greatly Weakened, Chinese Troops Gain Initiative

Moscow: Today, the Labor Newspaper commented on the Sino-Japanese War, stating: "The losses suffered by Japan in this war may not be recoverable within ten or fifteen years. The Sino-Japanese War has now entered its third year. We dare to say that Japan's military strength has been weakened, and the Chinese army has gained the initiative. The Japanese originally intended to destroy the Chinese army, but this plan has completely failed. China has entered the great second stage of the War of Resistance, and the situation is extremely good. The further consolidation of the anti-Japanese united front, the loyalty of the government under the leadership of General Chiang Kai-shek, and the destruction of all pro-Japanese traitors are the main factors for the final victory of the great Chinese people."

Editorial

### The United States, the Soviet Union, and the Far East Today

According to yesterday's news dispatches, the British side is currently considering sending a special envoy to the Soviet Union to promote Anglo-Soviet relations. Although this is unconfirmed news, it cannot help but remind us of the same time a year ago, when people all over the world were deeply concerned about the protracted and unresolved Anglo-Soviet negotiations. Unfortunately, the subsequent development of events was contrary to people's expectations. The three-nation negotiations were delayed and then shelved, replaced by the Soviet-German non-aggression pact, and the scourge of war in Europe became unavoidable. This page of painful lessons shows that any attempt to curb aggression must be forward-looking and decisive, and must never be ambiguous, or obscured by prejudice, lest one eventually regrets too late.

Now the European continent is in the midst of war, with its scope extending to one-third of the countries in Europe, and its momentum is even more dangerous than the previous World War. Although Nazi Germany clearly has the upper hand at present, the final victory or defeat cannot be determined by temporary advances and retreats. Even if the British side is truly engaged in brewing a reconciliation with the Soviet Union by abandoning suspicion, its significance is far from comparable to the three-nation negotiations last year. Apart from watching its development, there is no need to criticize it further. Outside of Europe, the Far East is still in the autumn of unrest. If, in Europe, all plans for locking the stable door after the horse has bolted are insignificant, then it is necessary to consider future changes in the Pacific situation with a view to taking precautions.

The tense situation in the Dutch East Indies, which has been realized due to the invasion of the Netherlands, seems to have eased again. Britain, the United States, France, the Netherlands, and Japan have all issued statements maintaining the status quo of the Dutch East Indies. On the other hand, the situation in Shanghai, which is of greatest concern to Chinese and foreigners, has recently been prevented from being coveted by ambitious people due to the wise measures of US Fleet Commander Hart. Looking at all these developments, it seems that the Western Pacific may be able to maintain a temporary peace, and may not cause major disturbances for the time being. This fact need not be needlessly speculated. However, statesmen who control the world's destiny must not be satisfied with merely maintaining the status quo, but must be able to see the subtle signs and take proactive measures to prevent problems before they arise. Judging from the actions of the United States and the Soviet Union over the past year, such as the US abrogation of the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation, the large-scale naval exercises in the Pacific, and the repeated statements regarding the Nine-Power Treaty, as well as the Soviet Union's generous support for China's war of resistance and its firm attitude in dealing with Japan, both the US and the Soviet Union can be said to have fulfilled considerable responsibilities. Today, although the European powers have been drawn into the vortex of war, the arrogant Japanese warlords still dare not act arbitrarily and do as they please. On the one hand, this is due to China's success in the war of resistance; on the other hand, it is not a small part due to the restraints of the US and the Soviet Union. However, to curb aggression and stabilize the Far East, these existing efforts are clearly not enough.

Although the United States and the Soviet Union have the same position and interests in the Far East, their actions are independent of each other and do not match each other. Not only is there a lack of understanding and cooperation, but there is also a subtle posture of mutual suspicion between the two sides. Even though the Soviet-Finnish war has been over for a long time, this suspicion has not been eliminated to this day. This is a major weakness in the Far Eastern international situation, and it is also the most worrying thing in future developments. The Japanese warlords have repeatedly used this gap, repeatedly applying their artificial "pro-" and "anti-" postures between the Soviet Union and the United States. Although the result has been nothing so far, they may not fail to take advantage of opportune moments to repeat this trick, causing harm to all countries. Moreover, the current policies of the US and the Soviet Union toward the Far East are sufficient to protect the status quo, but insufficient to prevent disasters. At a time when Britain and France are struggling to cope with Germany's fierce offensive, and the situation in the Mediterranean is extremely dangerous, the United States' participation in the European war will likely be unavoidable sooner or later, so it is necessary to make further preparations for the Far East as soon as possible. If the European war once affects the US, the balance of power in the Western Pacific will be in danger of being broken again. That prospect is exactly what the Japanese warlords are waiting for. At that time, they will inevitably threaten Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union with an aggressive posture. Problems such as the Dutch East Indies will inevitably become serious again. This possibility is increasing with the crisis of the European war. It may be the last opportunity now. If the powers do not quickly seek preventive measures, they will inevitably repeat the mistakes of the worsening European situation.

In order to curb the spread of wildfires and prevent future turmoil, coordination and cooperation between the United States and the Soviet Union is the most effective and essential way. Of course, until recently, there have been no signs of rapprochement between these two countries, and even the psychological barriers have not diminished. This unfortunate situation cannot be allowed to drag on. Originally, the differences in political systems and differences in thought are not reasons to prevent policy cooperation between the two countries. Compared with the tragedies suffered by mankind due to aggression, these problems are too small! For the sake of certain interests, Nazi Germany can change and join hands with communist Soviet Union. This kind of spirit is worth emulating by democratic countries. Look at the accusations in the British Parliament the other day regarding the failure of the three-nation negotiations last year, and you can understand how essential it is to organize a common anti-aggression action in the Far East today. Whether for the sake of the US and Soviet Union's own interests, or for the future of the Western Pacific, cooperation between the US and the Soviet Union is needed. If the US and the Soviet Union can cooperate, even if the European war expands again, this united force in the Far East will still be enough to control the situation with ease. Otherwise, apart from China herself, it will not be difficult to eventually gain independence and freedom with its ever-increasing strength, but the entire Pacific situation will inevitably remain difficult to be optimistic about. This point should be deeply considered by enlightened people all over the world.

### German Troops Cross the Sambre River. Allied Forces Continue Retreating from the Border. Fierce Battles Raged in Northern France Yesterday. Rumor that Saint-Quentin Has Been Occupied by German Troops.

Paris – German troops continued their fierce offensive on the front lines throughout yesterday, especially between the cities of Landrecies and Guise, west of Maubeuge. The battle resulted in some further progress. The British, Belgian, and French Allied forces are now making large-scale military adjustments on the left flank, namely in northern Belgium. The situation is being kept extremely secret. Military authorities only stated that this adjustment did not encounter any difficulties and did not elaborate. In short, the war situation from the Swiss border to northern France is roughly as follows: (1) From the Swiss border to the line of Maumedy, namely the Maginot Line, there is nothing worth mentioning. (2) Between Sedan and Laon in northern France, the German army did not launch a large-scale offensive, only engaging in small-scale encounters on multiple occasions. The situation was quite intense, especially north of Rethel. After the French counterattack, they have recaptured several villages and towns. To the northwest of Laon, after a large number of German reconnaissance troops advanced, they engaged in fierce battles with the French army, but their number of tanks was limited, not as many as those fighting north of Guise and Landrecies. (3) Between the Sambre River and the Oise River, the German army has reached a certain canal and seems to be attempting to advance on Saint-Quentin. (4) Between Guise and Landrecies, the German army launched a large-scale offensive with the assistance of tanks, artillery, and aircraft. The fierce battle began yesterday and paused slightly at night. The battle resumed at dawn today. According to those in charge, the German strategy focuses on surprise attacks, but the Allied forces are now prepared and will not be caught off guard. Judging from the recent progress of the German army, which is completely different from the situation when they began to attack the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg and the Ardennes region of France, one can understand this. (Havas Agency, 19th)

Paris – A French military spokesperson officially stated, "Extremely fierce fighting occurred throughout the day yesterday between Guise and Landrecies, in the northwestern part of the 'bulge'." Both sides resumed fighting this morning. French forces launched local offensives west of Rethel and between that area and Sedan, recapturing several villages and towns. In the northern part of Belgium, Allied forces are continuing to develop their strategic withdrawal movement. (Reuters, 19th)

Berlin – Officials from the German High Command declared that the decisive stage of the European war has begun. The main battlefield may still be between Paris and Brussels, which the famous Prussian military strategist Clausewitz called the "heart of France" 110 years ago. (Haitong Agency, 19th)

Berlin – According to reliable sources here last night, German tank units advanced towards Paris yesterday, nearing the Somme River, which is only seventy miles from Paris. Official reports state that German armored columns are advancing towards Paris from the Belgian front line, having reached the halfway point, and the northern front is becoming more stable due to the occupation of Mariakerke and Antwerp. The German News Agency claimed that a motorized unit has broken into the French forests west of the Meuse River. The news agency said, "German infantry has not lost contact and is rapidly following the vanguard." (United Press, 19th)

Paris – The General Headquarters has just released a war report stating, "Fierce fighting occurred on the front lines throughout the day today, especially in the area of Guise and Landrecies (northern France). Disregarding heavy losses, the enemy army is launching attacks on each of these cities with all its might. Nothing else is worth mentioning in other areas. Our bombers continued to attack enemy motorized units on the front lines, inflicting heavy damage. Reconnaissance aircraft also repeatedly flew to the front lines for reconnaissance. Many enemy aircraft have been shot down by our country's anti-aircraft artillery and fighter planes." (Havas Agency, 19th)

Paris – It is reported that British reinforcements have been continuously crossing the French border to participate in the major battle between the Sambre and Sedan. British mechanized units have now rushed to block the front and flanks of the advancing German army. (Reuters, 19th)

Paris – A French military spokesperson stated that the general impression created by the latest news from the Western Front is generally quite favorable. The Allied forces' great strategic movement north of the Sambre is continuing without being hindered or pressured by the enemy. Fierce fighting is occurring near Avesnes and west of Vervins between the Sambre and the Aisne. However, the German offensive is not as fierce as before. The major German forces may be experiencing supply difficulties due to the efforts taken by the Allied forces. (Reuters, 19th)

German War Report Declares Occupation of Saint-Quentin

Berlin – This afternoon's German war report stated that after overcoming the resistance on the island of Walcheren in the Netherlands, the entire Netherlands and the Dutch-controlled European islands have completely fallen into German hands. The German army's operations in Belgium have also made significant progress. After Antwerp was occupied, the German army pressed westward against the enemy and has crossed the Scheldt River, reaching the Dender region west of Brussels. The German army continued to advance between Maubeuge and La Fère, crossed the Sambre River and the Oise River, and occupied Le Catelet and Saint-Quentin. The German army in the south has reached north of Laon and the Aisne River. Fortress 505 of the Maginot Line has been captured. The number of enemy soldiers and military supplies captured by the German army is increasing daily. Excluding the Dutch army, the number of prisoners has reached 100,000, and many large cannons have also been captured, the largest being 28 cm in caliber. The German Air Force has been very effective in assisting the army's advance. Many enemy airfields and factories have been destroyed by bombs. Near the coast of France and Belgium, an enemy ship was sunk by a bomb. The ship had a displacement of 6,000 tons. Another destroyer was severely damaged. The enemy has recently lost another 147 aircraft, most of which were destroyed by bombs while parked at airfields. In air combat, the enemy lost 47 aircraft, and 13 were shot down by anti-aircraft guns. 27 German aircraft are missing. The German Air Force in Norway is still assisting the army in strictly guarding Narvik, and has sunk a 1,500-ton ship and a 6,000-ton troop transport ship. An enemy airship was shot down. Enemy aircraft bombed the northern and western coastal cities of Germany, dropping bombs, but did not hit military targets. (Haitong Agency, 19th)

Berlin – German military observers discussed today's war report, stating that the city of Saint-Quentin, which the German army occupied today, is located on the Somme River and has a population of 50,000. It is a key to northeastern France. The area currently under German attack is between Maubeuge and La Fère, a distance of 80 kilometers. The fortresses built by France in Maubeuge are quite close to the Belgian border and overlook the Sambre River. La Fère is also a fortified city located on the Oise River. This river and the Seine River, which runs through Paris, converge north of Paris. Now that the German army has crossed the Sambre River and the Oise River, the speed of progress can be seen at a glance. (Haitong Agency, 19th)

German Aircraft Raid Paris. London Feels Particularly Threatened.

Paris – Yesterday evening, air raids occurred in the Paris area. Two groups of enemy aircraft, eight in each group, attacked. Four of them have been shot down. (Reuters, 19th)

Paris – German bombers raided the urban areas of Paris yesterday. The German army is now only ninety miles from the French capital. Allied forces are desperately resisting the German army's rapid advance. The German army's advance was slightly blunted yesterday, but their troops are still advancing continuously. Yesterday, two German bomber squadrons, each with sixteen aircraft, attacked here. An alarm was issued 45 minutes prior. It is not known whether the German aircraft dropped bombs, as communications are being checked. It is reported that five German aircraft were shot down by fighter planes and anti-aircraft artillery. (United Press Agency, 19th)

Geneva – According to a military correspondent for the "Daily Telegraph," German aircraft can fly from their bases in the Netherlands to London in just one hour. After bombing, they can return to their bases to load bombs, which is convenient and requires very little fuel, allowing them to carry more bombs. (Haitong Agency, 19th)

London – According to official statements, although the German Air Force has repeatedly bombed undefended cities in the Netherlands, Norway, France, and Belgium, the British government still insists on its policy of not bombing non-military targets. Rumors that the British Air Force intended to bomb civilians or non-military targets are inaccurate. Their intention is clearly to create a prelude to expanding this inhumane method into British territory. (Reuters Agency, 19th)

Belgian Isolated Forces Still Defending Fortresses. The New Capital Suffers Bombing Again.

London – An official report was recently released from a certain location in Belgium, stating that the Belgian army's systematic retreat over the past two or three days has been carried out in good order. Affected by our sabotage, the enemy army has been unable to exert strong pressure, so our army's retreat has not suffered losses. This retreat action unfortunately requires the abandonment of Brussels and Antwerp. It is reported that the losses in these two cities are not significant. The forts of Liège and Namur are still resisting heroically. (Reuters, 9th)

Ostend – A Belgian radio station recently broadcast King Leopold III's message to the nation's soldiers, stating, "Commanders at all levels, military personnel, soldiers, and officers and soldiers of the Liège and Namur fortresses, you must defend the motherland and resist to the end. I have great expectations." The radio station then issued a statement on behalf of the people of the nation, expressing respect to the soldiers defending the forts of Namur, stating, "Your heroic resistance and determination to never surrender are admirable. This telegram is sent to express our respect to you. Your spirit of sacrifice is the inherent virtue of our nation and a model for us. We hope that you will accept our deep gratitude and continue to work hard to defend the motherland. The people of the nation pledge to be your backing." (Havas Agency, 18th)

Berlin – According to responsible military authorities, three-quarters of Belgium has fallen into the hands of the German army. Only the troops on the Belgian North Sea coast are still resisting, and their capture can be expected in a matter of days. (Haitong Agency, 19th)

One of the reasons for this confidence is that the stakes placed by the enemy are far higher than ours. In this great war, it is not certain whether we will win or lose, but even if we lose, it does not mean that we have been defeated in this European war. If the enemy loses, then it can be said that they have already been defeated. The reason why Germany is putting all of the massive military power it has built up before and after the Nazi Party came to power into this great war is for this reason. Like a roulette game, Germany is betting all of its huge amount of money on red, and the result will be black. Thus, Germany will fall into blackness. This great war is not much different from the great wars in the last European war. Last time, Germany also started fiercely and irresistibly, and then its momentum gradually weakened. As a result, the attacker was the first to run out of strength, and the defender turned to gain an advantage. Germany has now broken through a wide line of defense, but this is not the Maginot Line, but an extension of the Maginot Line that was recently built and has never been considered impregnable. The most admirable feature of this great war is the heroic performance of the Royal Air Force. Duff Cooper then read a telegram from Paris, which said, "Every Frenchman praises the bravery of the Royal Air Force and believes that it is the main factor in saving France." Duff Cooper continued, "Our young pilots have achieved many amazing feats in the past few days. Where does their advantage in war lie? German pilots are as skilled and brave in combat as we are. So, is it because our planes are superior to German planes? But this is not the main reason. As Oliver Cromwell said, 'The best soldiers are those who know what they are fighting for and love what they know.' Our country's youth are now fighting for the freedom of mankind, so their performance is extraordinary. For example, on Friday morning, five Whirlwind aircraft on patrol encountered forty Messerschmitt Bf 110 enemy aircraft. Although the ratio of numbers was eight to one, they immediately engaged after being attacked and shot down no less than six enemy aircraft. During the battle, one Whirlwind aircraft was hit and crashed. The pilot parachuted down and returned to the airfield. Another aircraft was damaged, but the pilot still flew it back."

### Twenty-One American Nations Lodge Collective Protest with Germany, Say Germany's Invasion of the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg is an Unreasonable and Brutal Act.

Panama – Twenty-one American nations lodged a collective protest against Germany's aggression against the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg, stating, "In accordance with the principles of international law, the American nations recognize Germany's invasion of the neutrality of Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg as an unreasonable and brutal act, and call for the reconstruction of justice and fairness among all nations." This protest was first initiated by the Argentine government and was immediately endorsed by the American republics. (Reuters, 19th)

### British Air Force Night Raid on Two Major Ports in Northern Germany, Bombing Oil Depots and Warehouses.

London – The Aviation Department has just released the following statement: (1) Our aircraft flew to the German ports of Hamburg and Bremen last night, bombing oil depots and other warehouses. The fuel currently used by the German army at the front lines is transported from these two ports. As a result of our bombing, several warehouses have been completely destroyed, and several others have suffered significant damage. In addition, our aircraft flew to the port of Bergen in Norway to bomb German warehouses and oil depots. (2) Our military aircraft flew to the area northwest of the city of Namur in Belgium last night, bombing various transportation routes used by the German vanguard, such as roads, railways, and important bridges, many of which were hit. (3) Our country's aircraft bombed enemy airfields set up within the borders of Belgium and strafed German transport convoys with machine guns. (4) Our patrol aircraft escorted merchant ship convoys in the North Sea and bombed German ships. One enemy ship was hit by our aircraft and suffered military damage. (Havas Agency, 18th)

London – According to official announcements, in the air battles in France on Friday, nine of our Whirlwind fighter planes destroyed ten German Junkers bombers, sending them crashing to the ground. At that time, twenty German aircraft were circling above a forest. The British aircraft dove down and attacked. All the Whirlwind aircraft have safely returned to their bases. (Reuters, 19th)

London – A Reuters correspondent stationed with the British Air Force in France reports that although the British Air Force's forward bases in France have been heavily damaged by the enemy, they have decided to hold on firmly. The losses suffered by the force due to low-flying German bombing are indeed huge, but they cannot shatter their fighting spirit or means of retaliation. In addition to constantly bombing German troops and other targets, British fighter planes are also carrying out large-scale interceptions south of the Sambre River, covering enemy aircraft advancing on tanks. The situation of air force operations yesterday is still unknown, but our Whirlwind aircraft engaged forty German Messerschmitt aircraft and shot down six of them. Last night, the British Air Force shot down another fifteen enemy aircraft of various types. (Reuters, 19th)

### British Air Force Achieves Repeated Successes in Battle, King George Sends Congratulations.

London – The British King recently sent a telegram congratulating the British Air Force on its battle achievements, saying, "When I visited the headquarters of the bomber command, I was able to continue to hear about the heroic battle achievements of the bomber teams in recent weeks, coupled with the tireless work of the coastal forces and the valiant fighting of the fighter squadrons in this country and France, which has created an immortal history. This history includes the entire Empire, because its children are now achieving results in the army, navy, and air force. I congratulate the Air Force now and predict its future continued victory. Its spirit of invincibility makes the final victory of the Allies even more reliable." (Reuters, 18th)

### London City Area Strictly Fortified, Residents' Lives Normal.

London – Last night, London was filled with machine gun posts with sandbags. The British people felt the threat of foreign invasion for the first time since 1066. Fully armed troops guarded the important cities of the country. The roads and waterways connecting to London were also laid with barbed wire and patrolled by troops. Patrol cars were running back and forth in London, checking those who violated the rules of dimming lights and preventing signals from the "Fifth Column" collaborators. (United Press, 19th)

London – London residents and the general British public are now reading war news with firm determination. Their daily lives are as normal as usual and have not been disturbed by the war. Theaters and cinemas are full. Traffic on roads and railways is also as usual. Apart from newspapers and announcements, as well as soldiers on the roads and barrage balloons in the air, the whole city maintains a state of quietness. Saturday evening newspapers still focused on sports news, interspersed with war reports from France and Belgium. The average Briton expressed concern about the German "breakthrough" into the Allied lines, but all are convinced that the current setbacks are only temporary. They feel at ease in view of the Royal Air Force's bright and brave performance. (Reuters, 19th)

### City of Paris in a State of War.

Geneva – According to news received here from Paris, the French capital has recently fallen into a state of panic again, just like in 1871 and 1914. The French people all recognize that the German army is actively advancing on Paris. People are ordered to stay indoors as much as possible in order to organize supplies and stockpile food. Countless refugees from the north were transported to the Gare du Nord yesterday. Banks and large stores have begun to move to safer areas. Several Parisian newspapers have made preparations to move to Marseille, Toulouse, and other places to publish. (Haitong Agency, 19th)

Milan – According to the "Corriere della Sera," the diplomatic envoys of various countries stationed in France are prepared to leave Paris. All embassies are packing their luggage. The general public expects that a fierce battle near Paris may determine the outcome within 48 hours. It is said that there are differences of opinion within the British and French general staffs. The British side advocates stopping the German army from occupying the English Channel coast at any cost, while General Gamelin insists on withdrawing troops from Belgian territory to protect Paris. (Haitong Agency, 19th)

Milan – The Paris municipal authorities have assured the citizens that various measures have been taken for protection and supply, and residents should maintain a calm attitude. Any theft activities will be punished by firing squad by a military court in accordance with the special decree issued yesterday. (Haitong Agency, 19th)

### London Smashes "Fifth Column" Organization, Secretly Plots to Sabotage Water and Electricity Transportation, French and Belgian Farmers Strictly Guard Against Paratroopers.

London – Yesterday's news: British intelligence discovered an organized "Fifth Column" group yesterday. It is reported that the group is planning to occupy various power plants, radio stations, and carry out railway sabotage. It is reported that this case was cracked based on clues provided by the Netherlands. The group includes many German men and women secretly sent to Britain by the German side, as well as detailed maps of various British factories, telephone lines, and water plants. (United Press Agency, 19th)

Paris – The farmers of France and Belgium are now also following the army and engaging in war work, but the work of these people is behind the front lines, attacking German paratrooper teams. Many farmers always carry guns with them while working in the fields and tending livestock. A reporter recently traveled and saw that even women were standing on the streets of villages and towns with pistols in their hands to watch the air battles. Once, an aircraft was hit by anti-aircraft artillery and caught fire. The wreckage broke into pieces and fell to the ground. One piece of aircraft wreckage fell slowly, very much like a parachute gliding down. The farmers were all extremely angry and fired their guns into the air, regardless of whether the target was identified. But in the end, the wreckage that fell was a broken wing of an aircraft. Although thousands of German paratroopers have been killed in mid-air or on land while descending into French and Belgian territory, the number and work of these paratroopers have not been reduced as a result. They land every night, but these paratroopers, due to attacks by the people of France and Belgium, no longer dare to land during the day and have switched to night raids. The Allied people's vigilance is not without reason, because they now know the German use of spies. The duties of German spies are to infiltrate the rear of the Allied forces for reconnaissance and quickly report the movements of the Allied forces and the positions of the artillery teams to the German General Staff, so that the German side can change its battle plans. The German paratrooper teams are also a type of spy. Some members of the paratrooper teams wear Allied military uniforms and disguise themselves as Allied soldiers, while others dress up as priests, workers, or farmers. It is not easy for the Allied forces to inspect all priests, workers, and farmers one by one, so German spies can easily mix among them. Once these paratroopers land safely, the danger has passed and they can work with peace of mind. According to an official from the French intelligence department, the German side has more than 25,000 of these adventurous paratroopers who sacrifice their lives, and they are all young people. (United Press Agency, 19th)

### Surrender of Dutch Troops: The Course of Events

London: The Dutch Embassy in London issued a communiqué today explaining the course of the Dutch army's surrender, and describing in detail Prince Bernhard's recent return to the country to inspect the province of Zeeland. It stated, in brief, that Prince Bernhard, on the order of Queen Wilhelmina, returned from London to his country's province of Zeeland on the 16th of this month for inspection. The soldiers and civilians of the province were extremely excited. In addition to inspecting the defense forces, the Prince explained to them the reasons for the surrender of the main land forces in various locations. Because Germany used illegal and barbaric warfare methods, the Dutch army was no longer able to continue resisting. At the very beginning of the outbreak of war, the Dutch military authorities believed that Allied British and French forces would be passing through a certain bridge, so it was not destroyed. Unexpectedly, the German side was well aware of the strategic value of this bridge and secretly dispatched troops disguised as Dutch soldiers to seize the bridge. Later, they transported reinforcements by seaplane to strengthen the defenses. At the same time, paratroopers assisted in the operations, allowing them to cross the Dutch defense line and attack the rear of the defending troops in the flooded area. It can be seen that the loss of this bridge became the deciding factor in the entire war situation. In addition, the German army used the same strategy to occupy the island of Dordrecht and the port of Rotterdam. Then, using Dutch prisoners as a vanguard, they advanced. Furthermore, fifteen ambulances of the Dutch Red Cross were hit by incendiary bombs dropped by enemy planes. While Red Cross personnel were rescuing the wounded from the destroyed ambulances, enemy planes strafed them with machine guns. Their cruel behavior can be seen in this instance. (Havas dispatch, 17th)

### German Troops in Narvik Isolated

Paris: The German attempt to rescue Narvik from Trondheim by sea has failed. According to news from the Narvik front, many German transport ships have been sunk or captured by Allied warships. Refugees arriving at the Swedish border say that the Allied air force is clearly superior to the German air force in the Narvik area. In one air battle, several German planes were shot down. Currently, the only way for German troops to retreat from Narvik is through the Swedish border, but there is also the possibility of being blocked by Allied forces. The city is now effectively in Allied hands, and they are pursuing German troops retreating towards the border north of the city. Naval vessels are constantly bombarding, and aircraft are constantly flying overhead. (Reuters dispatch, 19th)

### Mussolini Hesitates and Observes: Mediterranean Situation Temporarily Eases; Roosevelt's Reply Lacks Definitive Language; Extreme Concern over Balkan Situation

Rome: The intentions of Italian Prime Minister Mussolini regarding the Western Front remain elusive. The general expectation in Rome was that Italy would inevitably intervene militarily shortly after Germany launched a large-scale attack on the democracies of Western Europe. However, the German offensive has been underway for ten days and has achieved initial victories, yet Italy remains inactive and there is no sign that it will change its policy in the immediate future. According to certain observers, the moment of Italian action is not as imminent as generally believed. At least for the time being, it will likely continue to harass Britain and France, rather than act rashly, as the current war is bound to be protracted. Britain and France hold strong positions in the Mediterranean and are not easily intimidated. Furthermore, if Italy joins the war, Turkey will inevitably aid Britain and France, and Yugoslavia may also fight against Italy. On the other hand, the United States has reacted strongly to Germany's invasion of Belgium and the Netherlands, which has deeply impressed Italian political figures, who believe that the possibility of American intervention has increased. At the same time, Italy does not want to disrupt the balance of power in Europe solely to benefit Germany. All of these factors cause the Italian authorities to hesitate and deliberate, rather than take hasty action. The reason for the contradiction and hesitation in Italian policy lies in this. (Havas dispatch, 19th)

Rome: It is reported that Mussolini has replied to the private appeal telegram he received from President Roosevelt last week, using vague language without any definitive statements. (Reuters dispatch, 19th)

Rome: Some believe that the news that the Italian ship "Rex" passed through Gibraltar en route to Naples without being inspected for contraband indicates a slight easing of tensions between Britain and Italy. However, this news has not been published in any newspapers. What has been reported is a dispatch from Genoa stating that the Italian ship "Roma" was detained in Gibraltar for as long as thirty hours, and many tons of kerosene were confiscated. British officers conducted a very strict inspection. The dispatch did not mention that the inspection of the ship took place on May 6th. (Reuters dispatch, 19th)

Rome: Renowned Italian journalist Gayda published an article in "Giornale d'Italia," stating that Italy is closely monitoring the political situation in the Balkans, and the Balkan coast is of great importance to Italy, as this coast has many naval bases. The Italian coast is very shallow, from Venice to Durazzo, making it vulnerable to attack. Therefore, the defense of Italy's east coast depends on the military and political situation on the west coast of the Balkans. Italy is extremely concerned about the political and military attitudes, diplomatic policies, and various constraints of the Balkan countries. (Haitong dispatch, 19th)

Malta: While the people here are quite resolute and have fully prepared for any eventuality, their attitude remains very calm. It is not expected that there will be any immediate developments in the Mediterranean. (Reuters dispatch, 19th)

Berlin: The new Italian Ambassador to Germany, Alfieri, recently met with a reporter from the "Völkischer Beobachter" and reiterated the close relationship between Germany and Italy, stating that the Fascist revolution and the National Socialist revolution have cooperated and strived to solve social problems for many years. Regarding political issues, Germany's success in all areas this year has greatly increased Hitler's prestige. The Italian people admire the victories of German arms and the vigor of the German people. The Italian people can be said to be the country that best understands Germany. I am deeply gratified to be appointed as Ambassador to Germany at the time of the anniversary of the German-Italian military alliance. (Haitong dispatch, 19th)

### Italy Full of Mockery Towards the Allied Forces

Rome: This morning, the Italian radio station, broadcasting news in French, commented on the British War Office's statement that the British army suffered no losses during its retreat from Antwerp, stating sarcastically that the British army fled, disregarding the Belgian army. Knowing that fighting should not lead to desertion, it is lamentable for the future of the French people if France, as a co-belligerent, considers "retreat without losses" a fortunate event.

### American Aircraft Production Surges; America Can Become World's Largest Air Force Country in One Year

Los Angeles: Leaders in the American aviation industry recently stated that as a result of large-scale production last year in response to British and French demand, they can use this experience to make America the world's largest air force country within a year. According to Zwieta, president of the New York Aviation Association, America's military buildup began last year, and the large amount of British and French orders received in recent months has greatly developed our productivity, greatly improved our technology, and expanded our operations. We do not feel any difficulty. The existing forty-five aircraft factories only need to double the area of each factory, double the area of the aviation machinery manufacturing plants, double the number of workers, and adopt a twenty-four-hour work standard to complete the 50,000 aircraft stipulated in President Roosevelt's defense plan.

### War Situation Extremely Serious; Partial Cabinet Reshuffle in France; Diplomatic Personnel Transferred to Increase Activity; Pétain Assists Military Affairs with Associate Status

Paris: Prime Minister Reynaud gave a radio address tonight, announcing a partial cabinet reshuffle. At the same time, he reported that after German mechanized forces broke through French positions south of the Meuse River, they made slight progress again today. He stated, in part, "The duty of the government lies in action, and what the people expect from the government is practical action, not empty words. At this moment, what we never forget is the sacrifice of the soldiers, the suffering of their families, the displacement of refugees, and the innocent civilians who have been subjected to enemy air raids. In the face of this grave situation, our people can disregard their personal suffering and work together to overcome national difficulties. This is truly the greatness of the French nation. I reported to you yesterday that German mechanized forces had broken into our country south of the Meuse River and created a salient in our army's positions. As of today, this salient has made slight progress to the west. The situation at this moment is indeed very critical, but not hopeless. I believe that now is the time for the French nation to show its strength. For this reason, we have decided to partially reshuffle the cabinet in order to strengthen our forces. First, General Pétain, the 'Victor of Verdun,' returned to Paris this morning from the Spanish capital and has joined the cabinet as an associate and Minister without Portfolio. He will surely be able to make great contributions to assist military affairs and achieve final victory. Second, under the current circumstances, the Prime Minister must bear the responsibility for national defense. Therefore, from today onwards, I will concurrently serve as Minister of National Defense and Minister of War, and Mr. Daladier will be transferred to Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Mr. Mandel will be transferred to Minister of the Interior. [Mandel was a close associate of the late 'Tiger Premier' Clemenceau.] Third, the government has decided to transfer diplomatic personnel to enhance effectiveness, and the list will be announced shortly. In short, all of our country's institutions must adapt to wartime needs, and the spirit of war must be above all else. All citizens, whether serving in the military or working in the rear, must strive to fight and vow to defeat the enemy." (Havas dispatch, 18th)

Paris: Political figures here especially approve of the reshuffling of the cabinet, particularly the appointment of General Pétain, the ambassador to Spain, to the cabinet, and the transfer of Colonial Minister Mandel to Minister of the Interior. General Pétain (now 84 years old) is a famous general from the last European war, and from now on, as an associate of the cabinet and Minister without Portfolio, he will be able to make great contributions to military affairs. As for Mandel, he is known for his resoluteness and decisiveness, and after being transferred to Minister of the Interior, he will be able to deal with the internal treachery of the so-called "Fifth Column" with the greatest determination. (Havas dispatch, 18th)

Paris: The government recently transferred Ambassador Roux to the Holy See in the Vatican to be Secretary-General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the original Secretary-General, Léger, will be transferred to other important positions. Roux is a veteran of the diplomatic world, and previously served as Minister to Czechoslovakia in 1926, and in 1932, was promoted to Ambassador to the Holy See. He is a researcher at the Académie Française and has written many historical books, including one on the history of Egypt, which is the most famous. (Havas dispatch, 19th)

Paris: The transfer of French Ambassador to the Holy See Roux to the Secretary-General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has been commented on by diplomatic figures. When Prime Minister Reynaud gave a radio address last night, he mentioned the transfer of diplomatic personnel to enhance effectiveness, and this move is probably the beginning. After Roux and Ambassador to Spain General Pétain are successively recalled, other important diplomats will also be transferred. The new Secretary-General Roux is familiar with various political issues in Central Europe. Later, during his tenure as Ambassador to the Holy See, the relationship between the Holy See and France was extremely close. They shared a common belief in defending human characteristics and national independence, which Pope Pius XII reiterated last December. Prime Minister Reynaud also recently spoke of "defending the Latin nations and Christian civilization." The reason why Italy hesitates and does not align with the German pagans is because of this shared characteristic of French and Italian civilization. (Havas dispatch, 19th)

### German Summary of the War Situation – Starting from the Norway Campaign

Berlin: According to responsible officials from military authorities, the 37th week of the war is described to the Haitong News Agency as follows: When German troops were stationed in Narvik, Norway, the British and French launched joint attacks from the north and south. After a month, German troops bravely fought back, repelling the British and French Allied forces and the Norwegian army, which retreated north. German troops completely occupied central and northern Norway. Northern England and Narvik are 270 kilometers apart. The German troops in Narvik succeeded with the assistance of the air force. During that week, one destroyer and three transport ships of the British fleet docked in Narvik were hit and sunk, while two cruisers and two destroyers were also bombed and damaged. The port of Narvik was completely destroyed, and the railway from Narvik to the Swedish border was also destroyed. On May 10th, German troops began attacking the Western Front, from the southernmost part of Luxembourg to the mouth of the Eem River on the North Sea, a line 450 kilometers long. Luxembourg was completely occupied within a day, and the Netherlands followed suit. Belgium also fell into German hands after a few days, and the front line extended to Leuven and Namur.

By May 16th, German troops had occupied a total of 67,000 square kilometers of the Netherlands, and 50,000 square kilometers each of Belgium and Luxembourg. The line of German advance on the Western Front was shortened from 450 kilometers to 250 kilometers.

As German troops continued to capture the Meuse River and Sedan, invading northern France, Belgium built modern, strong artillery and the strongest fortifications of Liège on the banks of the river. Although they all fell into the hands of the Allied forces, the Allied forces failed to provide assistance to Belgium and the Netherlands. The southern wing of the Dutch army lost contact with the northern wing of the Belgian army, and the Dutch army finally surrendered to Germany on May 14th. The German air force exerted its power, protecting the northern wing of the German army, while bombing the British army on the southern coast of the Netherlands. In the first six days, the German air force sank many enemy ships. At the same time, the German air force flew to contain the British troops assisting the Netherlands and the British and French Allied forces assisting Belgium. The German air force then engaged in air battles with enemy aircraft over Belgium, the Netherlands, and France, shooting down three to four hundred enemy aircraft. In addition, Germany landed paratroopers in the airfields of Belgium and the Netherlands, so Rotterdam and Antwerp were able to be occupied. The German army then occupied the first Belgian fort, Eben-Emael, with the latest weapons. The German air force assisted the tank and mechanized units north of Namur in attacking the enemy army. This was the situation on May 13th.

On May 14th and 15th, German troops crossed the Meuse River south of Namur and Sedan in northern France. German troops launched a fierce attack on the French army, and finally repelled the French army. In the south of Sedan, the French army participated with 90-ton tanks, which they considered to be such heavy weapons that they would be invincible, but they were ultimately forced to withdraw from the battlefield by the power of the German air force.

During the first six days of the war, the German air force had significant achievements. The German air force shot down a total of 1,350 to 1,500 enemy aircraft. In the following days, enemy aircraft suffered fewer casualties, as the German air force went to bomb the enemy's rear.

After this, the enemy will launch a decisive battle in Antwerp, the Leie River, Namur, the east bank of the Meuse River, and Sedan. The Dyle Line has been broken through, and Mechelen, Leuven, and Brussels have been occupied. The French advance has been blocked. The battle situation on the Maginot Line and the Meuse River can be deeply observed for the momentum of the German advance. (Haitong dispatch, 19th)

### German Mechanized Troops Go All In; Only One Division Not Deployed

New York: According to the "New York Post," highly placed sources in Washington received unconfirmed telephone messages from equally highly placed sources in Paris stating that the French authorities are certain that all but one of Germany's twelve mechanized divisions have joined the fighting and have suffered losses. More than 1,500 German planes have been shot down. Germany's expenditure of its strength in this way means that it will not be able to organize such a large-scale assault again. Therefore, although the overall situation is extremely serious, the French government remains confident that whoever can contain Hitler in this large-scale war will never find peace. (Reuters dispatch, 19th)

### Former German Emperor Still Resides in the Netherlands

Berlin: According to a Haitong News Agency reporter, former German Emperor Wilhelm II is currently still in Doorn, Netherlands. The news about Wilhelm moving to Potsdam or East Prussia is unfounded. There is no fighting in the Doorn area. Wilhelm II's fourth son, Prince Wilhelm of Prussia, spoke with his father by telephone last night. Wilhelm said that his health was as usual, and the German authorities have guaranteed him all kinds of protection. (Haitong dispatch, 19th)

### US Senate Expedites National Defense Budget

Washington: The Senate Committee was busy yesterday processing President Roosevelt's national defense bill. It is widely believed that the entire military budget of $3,131,472,651 will be submitted for discussion at the beginning of this week. This is the highest amount of American military spending. After obtaining a simple report, the Senate Military Subcommittee increased the Army Department's financial budget to $1,827,491,724. At the same time, the Senate Naval Committee is also quickly preparing a budget of $1,303,980,927 for expanding the fleet and naval strength. In addition to President Roosevelt's emergency budget, these two bills include the annual expenses of the Army and Navy Departments. (United Press dispatch, 19th)

### American Prices Continue to Plummet; Speculators Reap What They Sow; European War Blocks Sales, Forcing Further Liquidation; Speculators Have Already Lost Over 50 Million

Since the outbreak of the war, the general speculators of this city have been heavily buying foreign exchange and foreign stocks, and hoarding goods from Europe and America. After the outbreak of the European war, these speculators turned their speculative targets to hoarding American goods and buying American stocks and US dollars. Recently, the US dollar has been rising sharply, and they have already lost a lot. In addition, the easing of foreign exchange has greatly affected the decline in commodity prices, so the misfortune of these speculators is like a leaky house in a continuous downpour. Due to the sharp drop in stocks and the continuous decline in commodity prices in the United States, they have suffered even more severe blows and suffered huge losses. As of last Friday, the major Shanghai speculators with strong capital have lost at least more than 20 million yuan in the decline of American stocks and commodity prices alone.

Stocks and Commodity Prices Continue to Plummet

According to a reporter from Pingming News Agency, a certain foreign firm in this city received a telegram yesterday stating that stocks and commodity prices in the New York market in the United States continued to plummet last Saturday. As of the day before yesterday (Saturday), various US stocks have fallen by an average of about 20%, and the stocks with the largest declines have fallen by more than 40%. Even military industrial stocks are showing a downward trend. As for the market prices of general goods, regardless of their type, they have generally fallen by an average of 20%.

Chinese Suffer Unprecedented Losses

Therefore, the losses suffered by general Chinese speculators in Shanghai have exceeded 20 to 30 million yuan. According to estimates by well-known foreign business enterprise financial institutions in this city, the losses are at least about 3 million US dollars, equivalent to 54 million yuan in national currency. Although they once made huge profits when the black market US dollar was priced at six yuan, they have now suffered such a blow, and the gains do not outweigh the losses. It is rare for Shanghai Chinese merchants to suffer such huge losses from speculation, but it is also because Shanghai Chinese merchants are engaged in speculative hoarding as much as they are today. Moreover, with the decline in American commodity prices, the market prices of other foreign goods and even Chinese domestic goods will also collapse. Therefore, the losses of large and small speculators in this city this time are extremely large.

The Reason for the Liquidation Lies in the European War

As for the reasons for the decline in American stocks and commodity prices, (1) the sharp drop in stocks is due to the impact of the European war. The major American companies are popular all over the world, and their industries and companies are also spread everywhere. This expansion of the European war will inevitably cause considerable losses to the various branches affected by the war, which will in turn affect the stock prices of the parent company. (2) The slump in commodity prices is also due to the impact of the war. The largest customers for American exports have always been Asia and Europe. The war in the Far East is still ongoing, and the European war has also started and is expanding, resulting in a stagnation of American export trade, which eventually led to devaluation.

### General Honjo Shigeru Will Come to China Again

Japanese General Honjo Shigeru will come to China recently to inspect the situation of the Japanese army in Central China. It is reported that Honjo has left Japan with 13 important members of the vehicle department in recent days, first to North China, and then to Shanghai to inspect Central China. Honjo was formerly the commander of the Kwantung Army.

### Shanghai-Fujian Trade Gradually Becomes Difficult

There are more than 50 Fuzhou merchants engaged in import and export trade in Shanghai, among which Yunzhang Shenzhuang, Chenxiji, Jiankang, and Xianxin are the largest. Before the first half of last year, the value of imported goods (transported to Fujian) was as high as 7 million yuan per month, and the value of exported goods (transported from Fujian to Shanghai) was about 4 million yuan (according to imports, foreign cloth, cotton yarn, and kerosene are the main commodities, followed by foreign groceries; exports are mainly timber). However, since the second half of last year, business has sharply decreased, with imported goods falling to less than 3 million yuan. According to the Fuzhou merchants who spoke to a reporter from Pingming News Agency, since

Last Summer

Japanese warships have repeatedly detained cargo ships and obstructed navigation outside the mouth of the Min River, or even confiscated the goods. Therefore, since the second half of last year, all cargo ships passing between Min and Shanghai have had to detour through Sandu or Xinghua, and go through a week of land transportation. Therefore, the freight cost of import and export goods between Min and Shanghai has almost exceeded two-thirds of the original price, so the price has soared and business has declined. This is one reason. Secondly, Fuzhou has been repeatedly bombed by Japanese planes recently, and residents have evacuated to the suburbs one after another, so the demand has decreased. This is the second reason. In addition, recently, various shipping companies have repeatedly increased water feet, such as the Charon Company, which

Increased a Month Ago

The water foot increased by 25%, and now it will increase by 25% again, resulting in soaring prices of import and export goods, which is also the third reason for the decline in business. It is also learned that recently, the Fujian provincial authorities, in order to prevent Japanese goods from entering the mainland, require all imported goods to be registered in advance, and the import of cloth must be issued a memorandum by the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce. Recently, because of this procedure, the Fuzhou merchants are negotiating with the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and there has been no result, so Shanghai cloth cannot be imported, and it has been more than a month. The Fuzhou business is even more bleak.

### Refusing to Mark Prices on Goods; Citizens Launch a Mass Sanction; The French Concession Police Department Strictly Investigates Price Gouging and Malpractice in Weights and Measures; There Have Been Many Cases

Merchants control commodity prices, disregarding the hardship of the Fujianese. The authorities of the concession have delayed the implementation of price marking and trading methods. They are greedy for profit and forget righteousness, which is regrettable. The various city and Fujian groups in this city have decided on four measures to notify the city and Fujian to abide by them in order to show resistance: (1) In this autumn of high commodity prices, reduce consumption as much as possible and save material resources. Clothes do not have to be new, but they must be able to cover the body and be neat. Do not seek to be overfed or extravagant, but seek to maintain nutrition. Other supplies must be saved as much as possible. Everything should be based on the principle of buying less and using less. (2) If you must buy goods, you must choose to buy from merchants that have implemented price marking. Do not deal with merchants that do not change prices. (3) Promote cooperative purchase of necessities to reduce intermediary exploitation. (4) If you encounter hoarding or high prices, you should immediately report to the concession authorities for sanctions. It is also claimed by the Price Stabilization Committee that the plan for managing the rice market and supplying cheap coal to poor households formulated by the subcommittees on rice channels will be announced shortly.

The French Concession Will Implement the Plan

It is learned that one or two days before the general meeting of the Price Stabilization Association of the French Concession was held on the 9th of this month, the delegation of the Price Stabilization Association set off to inspect the vegetable markets in the French Concession and found that the prices of important foods had not been raised. For example, the selling price of pork was the same as the price list announced on the 3rd of this month, and the price of lard was even 20% cheaper. The same was true for fish and vegetable markets. The three plans passed by the Price Stabilization Association of the French Concession on the 9th were: (1) Adopting methods to improve the conditions of the rice market and the coal market. The methods for cracking down on the rice market formulated by the association will be published within a week, and the greatest efforts have been made to continue to supply cheap coal to benefit the poor. (2) Reorganizing the vegetable markets in the French Concession. A part of the Eight Immortals Bridge Vegetable Market has been designated for the exclusive sale of food for foreigners. The slaughterhouse has also been inspected, and the order and cleanliness are still good. (3) Controlling the price of bread. After studying the combination and quantity of bread manufacturing, the association decided to consult with the bread merchants in the French Concession to manage the bread market in the future. It is also learned that the association has obtained the cooperation of an agency that can estimate wholesale prices, and will further control retail prices. Since the source is the main reason for the competition, close attention has also been paid to the dredging of the source.

There Have Been Many Cases of Inspection

The public can report to the designated six police stations any incidents of excessively high prices of daily necessities or malpractice found in weights and measures or the quality of goods. Therefore, the French Concession has strict supervision over food. Those who have been reported are: (1) Meat: 42 cases of selling buffalo, 1 case of selling second-class meat, and 29 other cases. (2) There are many cases of forgery of beverages. Those who have been punished include those who used a large number of fuels to produce colored products and sold them under the name of Medoe high-grade wine, and were fined 500 yuan. Those who used inferior alcohol to sell under the name of Martel brandy were fined 200 yuan. Those who sold alcoholic beverages of unknown origin were fined 35 yuan and 50 yuan respectively. The Price Stabilization Association is now thoroughly investigating and dealing with merchants who raised the prices of their inventories due to the tight foreign exchange, but still did not reduce prices after the foreign exchange was released. According to the Price Stabilization Association, from April 15 to May 3, the French Concession Police Department conducted 85 inspections of the weights and measures used by merchants in the French Concession. Among these, 23 stores were punished for using counterfeit weights and measures, and the fines ranged from 20 yuan to 100 yuan. The French Concession Police Department discovered some cases in the premises of illegal merchants, including installing wooden boards or lead blocks at the bottom of the measuring instrument to reduce the capacity, and drilling holes in the weighing instrument to suppress the weight. The association hopes that the public will pay attention. If anyone discovers such illegal incidents, they should immediately report to the police station.

Recommendations for Preferential Treatment of Internal Capital Transfer

The market is full of floating capital, which fuels speculation and threatens people's livelihood. People with insight have long advocated the internal transfer of capital to meet the needs of national construction. Although the advocacy has been long, there are no concrete facts and methods. Therefore, the harm of floating capital in the market remains the same, and the people's livelihood difficulties have not been alleviated. It is estimated that there are about 30 billion yuan of floating capital in Shanghai, most of which is used for speculative hoarding. The failure of capital to be used properly is a major loss to the national economy and the people's livelihood. Here are two suggestions from an economist on how to transfer capital internally, which can be used for reference: (1) A consortium should organize the Xifu Northwest Enterprise Company, which specializes in accepting this trust deposit in Shanghai for the purpose of operating businesses in the interior. For depositors of this trust deposit, the consortium guarantees an annual interest rate of 7%. If there is a profit, the depositors and the consortium share it equally. This interest and profit are paid in Shanghai, without the need for internal remittance, eliminating the trouble of quota rebates. (2) The Four Banks and other well-known banks should promote the method of transferring deposits to the interior. All Shanghai branch depositors who are willing to transfer their deposits to the inland branches of the Shanghai branch are allowed to designate the location for the transfer. The interest rate is higher than that of the Shanghai branch, and the interest is paid by the Shanghai branch at each interest payment period, without the need for internal remittance, eliminating the trouble of quotas and rebates. The above methods can allow those who have no interest and experience in inland enterprises to gradually transfer their savings to the inland.

### Japanese Toa Dobun Shoin Students Investigate Various Places

Students from the Japanese Toa Dobun Shoin in this city will recently be divided into 26 teams to investigate resources and general conditions in the occupied areas and various places. Their destinations are the Yangtze River Basin, and Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangdong, Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, Suiyuan, Hainan Island, etc. Hong Kong is also one of the investigation locations.

### Six Major Cities in Japan Implement Sugar Rationing; In Addition, the Daily Use of Matches is Limited to Five; The Suffering of the People is Obvious

Dalu News reported that the Japanese government has decided to implement a system of rationing sugar and matches in six major cities in the country, namely Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto, Nagoya, Kobe, and Yokohama, starting from June 1. Each person is allowed to receive half a pound of sugar and two small boxes of matches (equivalent to five matches per day) per month. The general Japanese people have mixed opinions on this, and they are deeply afraid that the rationing system will not be limited to the above two items, and it is doubtful whether the quantity stipulated by the government is sufficient. It is found that the Japanese government has not yet achieved satisfactory results in dealing with the supply and demand of major items, so the people are quite suspicious of the Minister of Commerce and Industry Fujiwara's claim that the rationing system for food and matches can be carried out smoothly. The newspaper strongly urged the Fujianese not to take the opportunity to hoard sugar and matches.

### British Commander-in-Chief of the Army in China Came to Shanghai from Hong Kong for Inspection; He Also Had to Go to North China for a Routine Inspection; Chinese Enthusiastically Donated to Belgium

At that time, he may summon British Commander of the Army in Shanghai Major General Simmons and inspect the British army in Shanghai, and then go north to Tianjin and North China for a routine inspection.

Shanghai British Children Died for the Country

The Western child Norbleston, who once studied at the Shanghai Municipal Council School, served the Air Force of the motherland on March 26 this year. According to news from Shanghai, Norbleston unfortunately died for the country. It is said that Norbleston's parents are still alive. His father used to work for the Water Company, and later retired due to old age and returned to England with his family. Norbleston was married to Ms. Lauter of Walsh. During his studies in Shanghai, he was a sports athlete and was good at boxing. He was quite famous in the school.

The British Side Announced Wartime Donations

After the countries of the British and French Allied Line successively declared war on Germany on September 3 last year, the British official in Shanghai established a society for centralized wartime fundraising, which aimed to enrich the wartime fund. The French side also set up a fundraising association to comfort the soldiers on the front line due to Mrs. Ingor's call, and held dances at the French Ball Federation to raise funds. According to the British official disclosure, from September to December last year, a total of 395,155.85 yuan in French currency and 4.402-5-6 pounds in British currency were raised. However, those raised in mid-April of this year totaled 691,107 yuan in French currency and 12,590 pounds in British currency. All the above donations have been remitted to the motherland.

Belgian Apartments Sent Letters to German Overseas Chinese to Move

Dalu News reported that the Belgian Church in this city issued a circular on the 18th of this month, instructing all German residents in the apartments of the church to move out as soon as possible. The people who received the letter will all comply. It is said that the Belgian Church has a large amount of real estate in the French Concession. The apartments it operates include the Asturiet Apartments at the intersection of Huanlong Road and Meyer Shea Road, and the Alberty Road Apartments at the intersection of Albert Road and Lafayette Road. There are many German residents.

Chinese People Donated to Belgium One After Another

Since the wife of the Belgian Ambassador to China, Mrs. Jiumu, initiated a fundraising campaign to help Belgian refugees, people from all walks of life in Shanghai and abroad have been enthusiastically donating due to the drive of sympathy. The first batch of Belgian currency raised was 31,850 francs, 5 pounds in British gold, 500 francs in French gold, 285 US dollars, and 59,786 yuan in Chinese currency. The second batch raised 5 pounds in British gold, 1,000 francs in French gold, which was donated by Robert Maze, the Chief of the General Customs Administration, 225 US dollars, and 16,468 yuan in Chinese currency, of which Zhu Hexiang donated 200 yuan, Woodhead donated 100 yuan, and there were two other Chinese people who each donated 1,000 yuan.

American and Italian Cruise Ships Still Sail to Europe and America

The world situation is changing, and the European war is becoming more serious. However, cruise ships of the United States and Italy are still sailing as usual, ensuring the shipping between Shanghai and Europe and the United States. According to shipping industry sources, during the outbreak of the European war, Britain, Germany, the Netherlands, and Belgium were all swept into the whirlpool. Although merchant ships of these countries in the Far East can sail, they have been divided into wartime blockades in the Atlantic and cannot sail. Currently, the only ships that are still sailing to Europe and the United States and to Shanghai in the Far East are the ships of the American Mail Steamship Company and the Italian Cruise Line Company. It is learned that the American Mail Ship President Polk has decided to export from Shanghai on the 23rd to start the world class, and the President Taft will also sail from Shanghai to San Francisco, Los Angeles, Honolulu, etc. in the United States on the same day. As for the Italian Mail Ship Conte Verde, it is also scheduled to sail south from Shanghai on June 9 to Hong Kong, Singapore, Colombo, Genoa, etc. It is heard that if the Mediterranean situation is tense during the voyage to Europe and the United States by the American and Italian ships, it is planned to detour around the Cape of Good Hope.

The British and Italian Defense Zones Are Very Quiet

As the European war is deteriorating and the situation in the Mediterranean is becoming more serious, the participation of Italy in the war is imminent. The situation in the areas where the troops of various countries are stationed in the west of Shanghai in this city is inevitably becoming serious. However, until the fundraising, the situation in the area is extremely calm and peaceful. According to a reporter from Datong News Agency who inspected yesterday, there were no changes in the Italian army stationed along Robinson Road and the British army camp on Great West Road. The armed sentries at Fendoukou were also stationed as usual, and there was no tense atmosphere. The British flag was still hanging on the flagpole next to the British sentry post at the northern end of Kaixuan Road and Lujia Road, and was fluttering in the wind. The south of Lujia Road was guarded by French soldiers, and the middle was densely covered with barbed wire fences, and the situation was extremely quiet.

### Japan Has No Troops to Transfer; It Trains Young Soldiers in Shanghai; They All Cried When They Were Dispatched; Many Wounded Soldiers from the Front Line Were Transported to Shanghai

The Japanese side in the Nanshi area originally designated the area west of Rihui Port as the area for the garrison troops, and the area west of Rihui Port was purely an open and safe area, so there were very few garrison troops. However, recently, the mobile warfare in various places on the East Battlefield has begun, and all of them are regular army units, and the guerrilla forces in the suburbs of this city are also very active. Therefore, recently, the Japanese army has transferred wounded and newly arrived young soldiers to Nanshi for training, and they will be dispatched to various places for reinforcement immediately. Currently, the buildings west of Rihui Port, such as the Gaochang Temple Waterworks, are full of people. Many have been transferred to the garrison in recent days, and the soldiers all cried when they were about to leave. At the same time, a large number of wounded soldiers were transported back from various battle lines. Military vehicles were covered with tarpaulins to avoid being seen. The Zhongshan Sanatorium and Taikang Biscuit Factory on Longhua Road and Damuqiao were full of wounded soldiers. Therefore, those who pass west of Rihui Port must have a pass from the military department.

### Youth Writing Association Announces Essay Contest Results

Since its establishment, the Shanghai Youth Writing Association has actively promoted various association affairs. In March this year, in order to increase young people's interest in writing, it held a public essay contest with the topic "The True Meaning of Peace, Struggle, and Saving China." There were more than 200 entries, many of which were carefully crafted masterpieces, lengthy works, exposing fallacies, and interspersing with sincere opinions. This also proves the firm belief and loyalty of the youth in the isolated island community, and they will never be confused by heresies. All the submitted articles have been reviewed in detail by experts and ranked in order, and each submitter will be notified separately to receive bonuses and royalties.

### Shanghai Customs Trade from January to April This Year

### The Life of Rickshaw Pullers - We Should Offer Sympathy and Assistance, Just Don't Haggle Excessively When Riding

— Zheng Qing

The weather is gradually getting hotter, and everyone is busy with epidemic prevention. The Shanghai Rickshaw Pullers Mutual Aid Association is also holding its usual summer hygiene meeting.

Such gatherings, probably except for those in the rickshaw pullers' circle, are not much noticed by the public, and naturally, there is even less interest in them. However, this is indeed a social problem worthy of attention. Moreover, although it may be considered a backward transportation industry, at present, it is still a purely national capital enterprise that should be maintained! There are 9,600 rickshaws in the Public Concession and about 10,000 in the French Concession. There are 44,000 rickshaw pullers in the Public Concession and more than 50,000 in the French Concession. Excluding the occupied Nanshi and Zhabei, just in the two concessions alone, we can see about 100,000 rickshaw pullers everywhere we go (it is said that many have recently returned to their hometowns to farm). They occupy a huge and important number in transportation and manual labor sectors, so we absolutely cannot underestimate them, and we should do our best to offer sympathy and assistance. This is extremely easy to do; when we ride in their rickshaws, just don't intentionally or unintentionally haggle excessively! If you slightly raise a hand, their lives will directly benefit.

If you don't mind me being long-winded, life and hygiene are two sides of the same coin. Now, let's first talk about the lives of the rickshaw pullers I interviewed. Of the four essentials of life—clothing, food, housing, and transportation—they only need two—food and housing. Let's talk about food first: they can no longer simplify it further. Their hands often replace your forks, knives, or chopsticks. Holding a teacup in one hand and a pancake in the other, squatting on the street, they complete what you call the "bread problem"; even this costs three cents. If they sit at a food stall and happily order a bowl of soybean sprouts and eat three bowls of rice, it costs half a yuan. After digestion, excretion costs another two cents. Naturally, this is just individual living. Talking about home leads to housing: it's what you often see in the newspaper, a fire in some corner, burning dozens, hundreds, or thousands of shanties. That's where their homes are. Although they may not consider living there seriously, their income, after deducting food expenses for themselves and their families, still has to cover a bit of rent, which is quite burdensome. There, on barren grassy fields, covered with dilapidated shacks, water, everyone rushes to the Taiping faucet in the morning to get a small lead bucket in turn, insects, silkworms, constantly attacking them 24 hours a day. Those without families live together in a room, where it's difficult to even sit comfortably. Yet, they have lived peacefully in this environment for more than forty years.

You don't need to listen any further; you naturally understand what kind of hygiene this life has. Indeed, it's really not easy to talk about hygiene in this kind of life. However, this kind of life especially needs hygiene; otherwise, they are prone to illness and even more prone to death!

From this, we can see that the Mutual Aid Association's annual hygiene meeting has a profound significance. According to Director Gu, the result of the three-day event held at the Western District Branch of the McGinn Medical Society this year was:

Exhibition: The rooms displayed various physiological and pathological specimens, models, and colorful pictures, all very simple and eye-catching. Performances and films were shown twice a day, explaining in detail typhoid fever, dysentery, meningitis, diphtheria, scarlet fever, measles, smallpox, pneumonia, whooping cough, plague, tuberculosis, malaria, relapsing fever, as well as venereal diseases, self-discharge, parasites, etc. This guided their understanding and aroused their attention, so they all requested vaccinations and smallpox vaccinations, and everyone was busy.

On the last day, the baby contest was the most interesting finale. Their wives, holding three or six children each, enthusiastically participated. Among the 126 clean babies, three were found to be white, chubby, and lively angels that one could hardly believe came from poor families:

(1) Sun Da Wangzi, eight months old, 21 pounds

(2) Pan Liubaozi, eleven months old, 22 pounds

(3) Sun Da Gen, five months old, 17 pounds

Da Wangzi's mother received the prize! A set of flannel shirt and pants, shoes, socks, candy, and medicated soap. A group of people surrounded her, laughing and congratulating her, while also envying her. The rest all received candy. The worst twelve also each received a bottle of cod liver oil and nourishing products. We recall the annual "44" (referring to a disaster) and have never seen such a heartwarming scene!

There are still 38,000 rickshaw pullers in the Public Concession. We see that the number of participants above is less than a quarter, because some still don't understand this matter, and others are too busy making a living to take time off. It is hoped that the association will diligently guide them on one hand and actively promote the welfare of rickshaw pullers on the other, striving for even greater benefits at next year's seventh regular meeting.

### Robbery and Murder Case at the Bank of Communications in Xiamen - Dong Jiting Arrested - Sweeping Away Huge Sums of Money and Fleeing with a Prostitute, A Reward Was Offered for His Arrest, And He Was Finally Captured

Dong Jiting, from Changping, Hebei, used to work at the Bank of Communications in Nanjing. Later, due to the fall of Nanjing, he was reassigned to the Bank of Communications in Xiamen. Dong liked to wander and became acquainted with a famous local prostitute, Zhang Yueqin, and suddenly had the idea of stealing public funds and eloping with the prostitute. The key to the bank's vault was always in the hands of the cashier Wang. On February 9th of this year, Dong used deceptive methods to lure Wang to open the vault, and then Dong used a hammer to strike Wang's head from behind, killing him on the spot. Dong then stole 130,000 yuan in cash from the vault and fled to Hong Kong with Zhang Yueqin. Before leaving, he even falsely asked the bank's manager for sick leave. Dong stayed in Hong Kong for more than ten days, then brought Zhang to Shanghai and hid in the French Concession. At that time, the Bank of Communications published Dong's photo in newspapers and offered a huge reward for his arrest. Dong felt it was dangerous to stay in Shanghai, so he took Zhang north to Beijing. The Bank of Communications' wanted ad for Dong was published in newspapers in Hong Kong, Shanghai, Beijing, and Tianjin. Dong and Zhang arrived in Beijing, first staying in a hotel, and later settling in at No. 31 Zongmao Hutong. Because Zhang Yueqin spent lavishly in Beijing, she attracted attention. After Zhang Yueqin was arrested, she learned that Dong had returned to his native Changping, so the local "police" arrested Dong. Dong has now been taken to the "Beijing Court." Nothing has been heard about how he will be dealt with.

### After Her Husband's Death, Unwilling to Remain Chaste, the Mother-in-Law Sues the Daughter-in-Law to Hand Over Her Person and Property

Zheng Zhuang, an old woman from Fenghua, is 63 years old this year. She had two sons. The eldest son, Yonghe, now runs the Guomin Western Clothing Company at No. 17 West Xiafei Road. The second son, Renhe, also ran the Hua Yi Clothing Company on the same road before his death. He married Fang and had three children, the eldest named Li'en, the second Huai'en, and the third Xian'en. In 1931, Fang died in Ningbo. Zheng Renhe then remarried his wife's younger sister, Fang, as his second wife. In October 1935, Renhe also died. The children and property left in Shanghai were under the guardianship of Fang, the second wife, who also managed the property on behalf of the children. Recently, Fang, unwilling to remain chaste, gradually became pregnant and sold her husband's Hua Yi Clothing Company to others. Her mother-in-law, Zheng Zhuang, believed that Fang's behavior was detrimental to the property of her grandchildren (i.e., the wards under guardianship), so she retained lawyer Yu Hualong, who filed a lawsuit in the Second Branch of the Civil Court against Fang in her capacity as the original guardian, demanding that she hand over both the person and the property. After Judge Yu reviewed the case, the judgment was issued yesterday. The main points of the judgment were: the defendant should hand over the wards, Zheng Li'en, Huai'en, and Xian'en, to the original guardian, and should also hand over the property due to the wards Li'en, etc., to the original guardian for management. The litigation costs shall be borne by the defendant.

### The Zhou and Gu Kidnapping Case

Zhou Has Never Been Involved in Politics

At around 8:30 AM yesterday morning, a kidnapping case suddenly occurred on McAlister Road, north of the intersection of Brennan Road and Victory Road in western Shanghai. Dr. Zhou Junchang, engineer Gu Pengcheng, and a groom, Gu Zhenhua, were kidnapped and forced into a car, which sped off towards the Chinese area. Their whereabouts are still unknown. It is reported that Zhou Junchang runs the Shen Tai Silk Shop in Nanxun. What was reported yesterday, that he was once a member of the National Economic Commission when Zhang Jingjiang was the chairman, was actually a mistake for his brother, Junmei. As for Junchang, he usually practices medicine in Shanghai and has never been involved in politics.

### The Case of a Maternal Uncle Kidnapping His Nephew - All the Perpetrators Appeal the Third Trial

From perpetrator Wu Peng, Sent Back to the High Court For Retrial - Appeals by All Other Perpetrators Rejected

The notorious kidnapper Xue Guanpeng, colluding with accomplices Zhou Bin and others, kidnapped his nephew Wu Guorong (12 years old) in front of Hander Primary School at No. 277 Park Road at noon on August 30th of last year, demanding a huge ransom. He was arrested by the Old Gate Police Station. Based on his confession, another accomplice, Wu Peng, was arrested and taken to the First Special Court for interrogation. Xue Guanming and Zhou Bin were sentenced to 13 years of imprisonment for jointly kidnapping for ransom. Wu Peng was sentenced to eight years of imprisonment. After receiving the judgment, the perpetrators refused to accept it and retained lawyers Zhang Danping and others to file an appeal to the Second Branch of the High Court. Judge Nie presided over the hearing and ruled that the original judgment against Xue Guanming, Zhou Bin, and Wu Peng be revoked. Xue Guanming was sentenced to eight years of imprisonment for jointly kidnapping for ransom. Zhou Bin was sentenced to seven years of imprisonment for jointly kidnapping for ransom. Wu Peng was sentenced to two years and six months of imprisonment for assisting in kidnapping for ransom. The four ransom letters were confiscated. After receiving the judgment, the perpetrators still refused to accept the judgment and again retained lawyer Zhang Danping to file a third appeal to the Supreme Court. According to the petition, the Criminal Court of the Shanghai Special Zone Branch of the Supreme Court reviewed the case yesterday and ruled that the original judgment regarding Wu Peng was revoked and sent back to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court for retrial. The appeals of all other perpetrators were rejected.

### Pawnshop Owner Falsely Accused of Receiving Stolen Goods - Appeal Declared Not Guilty

Weng Yongsheng, a Cantonese pawnshop owner of Senchang Pawnshop at No. 286 Tianjin Road, together with Su Shunqing from Suzhou and Zhang Zhiting, a Cantonese pawnshop owner of Shengxing Pawnshop at No. 919 Haining Road, were accused by the bandit He Lianpin in February of this year of receiving three stolen coats and were charged in the First Special District Court. The first instance judgment sentenced He Lianpin to five years of imprisonment for robbery, and Weng Yongsheng and Zhou Guqing each to a fine of 300 yuan, and Zhang Zhiting to a fine of 200 yuan. Weng and others felt that this punishment was unjust and unfair, so they retained lawyer Qian Zheng to file an appeal to the Second Branch of the High Court. Judge Nie Chongyi once questioned the bandit He Lianpin, and his confession was completely inconsistent with the first instance, full of flaws. Witnesses Cai Wenyao and Yang Ganqing turned themselves in to prove that the coats retrieved by the police were theirs and had not been stolen. They were pawned because they were needed urgently at the time and pointed out in court that there were secret marks on the coats and that they fit perfectly, and that He Lianpin falsely accused them of being stolen goods. After defense lawyer Qian Zheng fully refuted He's false statements, Judge Nie announced the judgment: the original judgment was revoked, and Weng Yongsheng, Zhou Shunqing, and Zhang Zhiting were all declared not guilty.

### Large and Small Gambling Dens in Western Shanghai to Close by the End of the Month

According to the Social News Agency, gambling dens in western Shanghai were at their peak last year, with no fewer than forty or fifty of all sizes. Afterwards, the larger ones grew larger, so the smaller ones knew they couldn't compete and were gradually eliminated. By this spring, only twenty-four remained, large and small. After the "Japanese Entertainment Department Supervisory Office" was abolished on March 10th, all gambling dens were once ordered to close. However, due to the strong efforts of the gambling den owners, they still existed. Recently, Dasheng Gambling Den and others were again ordered to close, and Lianyi and others followed suit. Thus, the gambling dens in western Shanghai have fallen into decline. It is understood that all gambling dens in western Shanghai will be banned and ordered to close by the end of this month. Therefore, the gambling den owners have been panicking in recent days. However, it is not yet known whether this ban is permanent or a temporary order to close for a few days.

### Local News

Since the Shanghai Postal Administration increased postage rates from abroad, the amount of postage due has also increased accordingly. The original postage due stamps are no longer sufficient, so three new types of postage due stamps have been added from the Hong Kong Maritime Printing Office, with denominations of 50 cents, 1 yuan, and 2 yuan, colored yellowish-brown. They have now been printed, shipped to Shanghai, and put into use, and are being sold at the philatelic office on the third floor.

The "Shanghai Poor People's Clinic" provides free medical care for the poor and sick. The address is No. 79 Race Course Road. It will start sending out doctors today, from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM. It is reported that there are plans to add a surgical department in the future.

The Gold Bar brand cigarettes produced by the Hua'an Cigarette Company in this port were once very popular. Recently, due to soaring raw material prices, they have had to change the original packaging to a thinner paper. The selling price, free gifts, and cigarette quality will remain the same.

Dr. Li Wei, chief physician of the Weikang Dental Clinic on the second floor of HSBC Bank at No. 872 Beijing Road, Beinicheng Bridge, specializes in the treatment, filling, and extraction of teeth. His surgical skills are superb and his reputation is well-known. He is open as usual on Sunday mornings.

### Japanese and Puppet Forces Harass Yangzhong - Officials and Civilians Cooperate to Cope

According to people from Yangzhong, Yangzhong was once occupied and then quickly recovered. The provincial government sent Pan Bingying as the county magistrate, who made many innovations in administration and education, and actively carried out the work of educating the public, eradicating traitors and eliminating falsehoods without sparing any effort. The villains disappeared and hid, and local order was restored. This spring, the Japanese army launched another large-scale harassment, and the county seat fell. They used local ruffians such as Gu Xianchi to try to establish a puppet organization, but the people had been strictly trained, so Gu and others were thwarted everywhere. Now, County Magistrate Pan is still promoting county administration in the countryside and is consulting with local people on all relief measures.

### Citibank Establishes Fourth Office in Shanghai

The US Citibank in this port has built a new building at the corner of Mears Road and Rue Paul Henry, adjacent to the Cathay Mansions building, to establish a French Concession office, which opened on the 13th of this month. The general design of the new building was very thoughtful, because the foundation of the Cathay Mansions building on Rue Paul Henry is the most severely subsided in the city, and the depth of the subsidence has reached one meter, and it is still subsiding about one millimeter per month. Therefore, the foundation of the new building of the bank is separated from the Cathay Mansions building and is entirely made of cement and steel to avoid being dragged down. This project was undertaken by engineer Minidi Kaiwen and was completed in less than four months.

### China & Western Pharmacy Held Annual Shareholders Meeting Yesterday

The China & Western Pharmacy on Simar Road in this city held its 8th Annual Shareholders Meeting yesterday at 9:00 AM at the Emerald Theater on the fourth floor of the Sun Sun Department Store. More than 400 shareholder representatives attended, and Jin Zongcheng chaired the meeting. After reporting on the general business situation, the allocation of the 28th-year surplus and the company's capital increase were discussed. It was generally believed that it was necessary to increase capital in order to adapt to business operations. It was decided that all shareholders' official dividends for the 27th and 28th years would be used to subscribe for additional shares. On average, each old share could subscribe for one new share, and the remainder would be subscribed by directors, supervisors, and all employees. The amount of the capital increase was limited to 700,000 yuan, combined with the original capital of 500,000 yuan, for a total of 1,200,000 yuan.

### Weather Report

The Xujiahui Observatory's meteorological forecast at 4:30 PM yesterday stated that the weather around Shandong was clear, with strong and sandy winds but no specific direction. The weather here was cloudy and will turn clear, with westerly to southeasterly winds. The East China Sea will have northeasterly to southeasterly winds. Also, within the 24 hours before 3:00 PM yesterday, the highest temperature in this port was 82.9 and the lowest was 60.3. On the same day last year, the highest was 77.0 and the lowest was 61.5.

### How About the Future of Foreign Exchange (3)

— Xia Zhi

This article mainly speculates on the future of foreign exchange based on the current situation. It uses the article "How About the Future of Legal Tender" in issues 244-5 of this publication, and looks forward to its future based on the legal tender itself, which has continuity; although the latter was written two years ago, the points discussed have never changed and will never change, so it can be consulted.

This article is divided into twelve sections, which will be published in this publication one after another. The outline is hereby presented as follows:

1. Now We Should Laugh Silently (Previous Issue) 2. Treasury Bills and Stabilization Funds (Previous Issue)

3. "Restrictions on Withdrawals" and Frequent Thefts (Previous Issue) 4. "Not Maintaining" Is More Difficult Than Maintaining (Last Issue)

4. Possibility of Sino-US Cooperation on Shanghai Exchange Rate (Last Issue) 6. Trade Deficit and Stabilization Fund (This Issue)

5. Legal Tender Gold Reserves and Overseas Funds (This Issue) 8. The Truth About the Bankruptcy of the Ruble and the Mark (This Issue)

6. "Natural Level" and Artificial Level (This Issue) 10. Foreign Currency Value and Speculative Profits (To Be Continued)

7. Expansion of the European War and the Future of the US Dollar (Last Issue) 12. The Maximum Extent of Japanese and Puppet Sabotage (To Be Continued)

Throughout history, everyone knows that the fluctuations in the black market are due to people's "lack of confidence", so they are easily incited by various rumors and slanders; but why are they lacking confidence? First, they do not understand the reality and have illusions; second, they lack the ability to judge and are easily surrounded by confusing words; third, they cherish their private property but do not know how to maintain it reasonably; fourth, speculators all think that others are doing it, so why not me. Therefore, although historical facts have always shattered rumors, everyone's psychology cannot help but be swayed when rumors arise again. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to provide various basic facts about the future of the exchange market, so as to help readers enhance their judgment ability, so that everyone is psychologically prepared. It should have been published in order according to the procedures of each section, but because the expansion of the European War and the changes in the future of the US dollar have a particularly deep relationship with the black market in this city, this section will be published earlier in the previous issue, and the rest will still be published in order.

Some parts of this article were mentioned in the speech at the banquet of the Youth Association on Ba Xian Qiao on May 8. Because the signature is different, it may cause misunderstandings, so I make a special note here.

Due to the de facto large trade deficit, many people believe that "it is always pessimistic to use a limited exchange stabilization fund of 10 million pounds to maintain an unlimited huge trade deficit." Many people have discussed its crisis in articles; like a certain gentleman in the Finance & Commerce weekly even pointed out that the step-by-step decline in the black market price this year was caused by the large trade deficit of the Shanghai Jianghai Customs; he even expressed that he felt that the decline in the black market caused by the trade deficit was more dangerous than the decline caused by speculators. We are very grateful for this gentleman's enthusiasm for Chinese foreign exchange; at the same time, we hope that he will withdraw his view based on all the facts related to exchange. The author has always admired this gentleman's insight and foresight, and even more admires him as one of the foreign nationals in China who has the most research on the Chinese economy. The author has read many of his great works, and most admires him for the fact that the key to the balance of China's international balance of payments is not in trade, but in the income and expenditure outside of trade; such as remittances from overseas Chinese, expenses of foreigners (including businessmen, travelers, officials, troops, etc.) in China, and investment income from foreign securities, etc. Relying on this kind of income to offset the trade deficit is indeed a major morbidity in China's international balance of payments, and efforts should be made to increase production to find ways to correct it, but it is too objective to judge the future of the black market exchange rate based on the trade deficit alone, and to ignore the other factors that are beneficial to the black market exchange rate.

Second: The import value on the customs booklet is calculated according to the legal exchange rate, which should be corrected; but we feel that it is not very practical to simply correct the import trade value according to the black market price. From the perspective of international balance of payments: the accurate import expenditure value should be calculated according to the exchange rate at the time of settlement; in the period of stable exchange rates, the import values in the two periods of settlement price and receipt of goods are indeed almost the same, but that is not the case today. Although it is impossible to use this method to correct customs figures, the figures corrected by the black market price of the current month cannot be trusted too much. However: the trade deficit in the occupied areas, especially in places like Shanghai, is indeed a fact; the impact of the trade deficit on the black market exchange market is also undeniable. But it is not as big as generally imagined.

Third: The source of drafts in the black market exchange market is not purely the stabilization fund; perhaps most of them are transformed from Shanghai hot money. The foreign exchange sold by HSBC is not all from Hong Kong, and the foreign exchange dumped by Hong Kong is not all from the Sino-British stabilization fund; this is something everyone can imagine. Since the entry and exit of speculators are always replacing the entry and exit of the stabilization fund, then the conclusion that the consumption of the stabilization fund is measured by the amount of the trade deficit is of course absolutely inconsistent with the facts. Moreover, the operation of the stabilization fund is definitely not just out but not in. As long as they are not Japanese businessmen or other scumbags, the stabilization fund can find representatives outside of HSBC to absorb from the market for the preparation for future lending. May I ask if you followed Sassoon, Citibank, etc. in the past, weren't you definitely digging graves for your own speculative purposes?

Because of the increase in the amount of legal tender issued, because local currency is being implemented again in some areas, because of the long-term trade deficit, because the black market price of foreign exchange always shrinks quickly and loosens slowly, because of the continuous need for materials for the war of resistance, etc., people almost regard the government's income and expenditure as the family income and expenditure of a couple, thinking that they will inevitably "eat up everything" and inevitably "issue blank checks" and implement inflation. Looking at legal tender and foreign exchange with this pessimistic glasses, the more you look, the more pessimistic you become.

Everyone knows that with the development of the interior and the replenishment of those broken and burned legal tender, the increase in the issuance of legal tender is inevitable. And everyone knows that today's interest rates in various places are higher than usual; in Shanghai, in addition to the high interbank lending rates, there are also high exchange discount rates; these are exactly the phenomena of tight money supply rather than inflation. But when it comes to the fact that the amount of legal tender issued has exceeded 3 billion yuan, everyone feels that it is too much. However, if it is divided equally among 450 million people, each person will not even get 6.7 yuan. Compared with foreign countries, it is simply a small witch compared to a big one.

Currency Issuance and Population of Various Countries

Currency Issuance Number of People Average Per Capita

Japan 3,818 69 55.2

United States 4,956 123 40.4

United Kingdom 555 45 12.3

France 151,322 42 3,603

Germany 11,798 80 147.5

China 3,082 450 6.7

(Note) The unit of currency issuance is 1 million of the local currency of each country; the unit of population is 1 million people; the average per capita is 1 school of the local currency of each country.

As for the issuance of local currency, the number is not large, and they are all prepared with legal tender as issuance. Therefore, it is obvious that a part of the amount of legal tender issued is not in circulation. Not only that; this kind of non-circulating legal tender is not only the issuance preparation for local currency, but also the payment preparation for financial institutions in various places, which must be even greater. According to general estimates: 3 billion yuan of legal tender is concentrated in Shanghai, about 400 million yuan is left in North China, and 400 million yuan has flowed to foreign countries such as Hong Kong and Annam. Therefore, in the vast and accumulated country, there are actually only 1.2 billion yuan of legal tender in circulation. Therefore, even if local currency is added, it has to be said that it is still "more monks than gruel".

It is true that what everyone fears is "inflation", perhaps it is not the increase in the issuance of legal tender, but the concern that the reserve fund for the issuance of legal tender is not enough. To estimate the value of currency with reserve funds, in modern currency thinking, it can only be said that he is "reading old books with old glasses."

Strictly speaking: legal tender is a kind of managed currency. On the day when its legal basis continues to exist, even if there is no reserve fund at all, its value will not be reduced in the slightest. This is not the arbitrariness of the law, because the law has the country as its backing. And the country has a large number of manpower, material resources, financial resources, and the national spirit of eagerly demanding freedom and survival as its backing. Manpower, material resources, and financial resources constitute the material basis for the true value of legal tender; the great national spirit guarantees that these manpower, material resources, and financial resources do belong to legal tender. Everyone firmly believes that on the day when the final victory comes, the black market price will definitely loosen greatly immediately. At this time of great relaxation, the reserve fund will certainly not increase greatly immediately. Then the true value of legal tender is not in the amount of gold reserves; and it is conceivable that today's black market price cannot represent the true value of legal tender.

Theoretically, whether or not legal tender has gold reserves is not a problem; in fact, the gold reserves of legal tender still maintain as much as 48.9% to 58.0%. This is much larger than the UK's gold reserve rate of 38.2% in August last year and Germany's 0.7% in January this year. It can be compared with France's 59.4% in November last year.

If you suspect that the government's figures may be too high, then use Japan's intentionally underestimated figures to illustrate. The Japanese do everything they can to slander legal tender; but they still have to admit that legal tender does have huge gold reserves. Looking at their change from "destroying legal tender" to today's "using legal tender", it can be seen that they have to admit the fact that legal tender is strong and deeply rooted. Looking at their publishing industry, articles that "study" Chinese legal tender are often seen, but none of them dare to arbitrarily assert that the reserves of legal tender have been emptied. For example, the Oriental Magazine published in April of this year contains an article by Isamu Imura; this author is an expert in slandering legal tender. He began by fabricating that "the right to issue legal tender has been jointly managed by the United Kingdom and the United States". With this attitude of his, it can be imagined that he must have underestimated the reserve fund of legal tender very arbitrarily. However, what is the result of his arbitrary underestimation?

(1) 300,000,000 Hong Kong dollars of the Chinese government's deposit in HSBC in Hong Kong at the end of last year as a reserve fund for legal tender

(2) 550,000,000 yuan of private deposits in the same period, with the private property of important Chinese government officials being the largest

(3) 763,950,000 ounces of the total amount of silver deposited in China in the same period (calculated at 0.77 ounces per yuan)

(4) 171,000,000 ounces of silver deposited in the US Federal Reserve Bank as a legal tender foreign exchange stabilization fund

There are more than these four types that can be used as legal tender funds. The issuance preparation of legal tender is actually not within these four types, but has its own independent accounting. Imura's confusion of facts is originally necessary for his motive of slandering legal tender. Even if these four types are added together, it reaches 1.7 billion yuan, which is about 60% of the amount of legal tender issued at the same time, which is even higher than the official report. Assuming that half of them are private properties that the government cannot control, then the controllable still accounts for about 30% of the amount issued. Although Imura listed the above two or three types as private properties, and believed that the issuance preparation of legal tender was only 522 million yuan. But it is much better than Japan. Because at the end of last year, Japan's exchange fund was reduced to 300 million yen according to his official report. Adding his official number of 200 million yen for new gold mining each year, and about 200 million yen looted in China each year, then his exchange fund that can be used last year is 700 million yen in total; but his trade deficit with third countries last year reached 460 million yen. It can be seen that his remaining exchange fund at the end of last year was at most 294 million yen. It is less than 10% of his currency issuance of 3.82 billion yen at that time. Moreover, his official numbers are even more questionable.

The Truth About the Bankruptcy of the Mark and the Ruble

On that day in the storm and rain on May 2, because the Ministry of Finance remained silent, rumors in the market were confused, the degree of violent shrinkage was fierce, and the purchase of goods was universal, etc., people who did not know the situation clearly were almost psychologically as panicked as the era of the bankruptcy of the Mark and the Ruble at the beginning and end of the last European War. Even in peacetime, people often ask ridiculous questions such as "Will legal tender become the Mark or the Ruble" because of the daily shrinkage of the black market exchange rate, the annual increase in the number of legal tender issued, and the ever-increasing war.

This panic, this question, is really caused by not understanding historical facts, but only remembering historical phenomena. Everyone knows that the bankruptcy of the Mark and the Ruble at the beginning and end of the European War were both intentionally caused by the German government and the Soviet Russian government. Otherwise, it would never have been such a mess.

The German government had no way to resist the Allied powers by force, and the Allied powers demanded more than 3 million marks in reparations, which could not be borne by the German government and the public. Because accepting this demand would also bankrupt the German economy; so they used the means of burning their boats to destroy the Mark and destroy the Allied powers' extravagant hope of demanding huge reparations from Germany. As a result, the issuance of the Mark expanded unreasonably, continuously and infinitely, and finally the value of the Mark fell to hundreds of millions of times below zero.

As for the Soviet Russian government's promotion of the bankruptcy of the Ruble. It was even more due to their strategic policy. Although the Red Army had disarmed the bourgeoisie, the value of the Ruble still guaranteed the power of the bourgeoisie in society. Especially since the power of confiscation cannot reach the hidden part, in order to completely eliminate the hidden part, the Soviet Russian government decided to adopt the means of sacrificing the Ruble. From 1918, the amount of Ruble issued completed its means of destruction under the planned expansion of the Soviet Russian government. It is shown in the following table.

Ruble Currency Issuance in Soviet Russia from 1918 to 1924

January 1, 1918 27.3000

January 1, 1919 63.800

January 1, 1920 225.000

January 1, 1921 1.100.000

January 1, 1922 17.500.000

January 1, 1923 2.600.000.000

January 1, 1924 178.500.000.000

March 1, 1925 865.500.000.000

(Note) According to Ynugoff Economic Trends in Sovlet Russia, in millions of Rubles.

With this planned destruction, the value of the Ruble naturally fell sharply uncontrollably. During the October Revolution, one Ruble was nominally worth 52 cents in US dollars; in 1923, every US dollar was nominally worth 5 million Rubles. The Soviet Russian government issued gold Ruble notes on February 8, 1924. These gold Ruble notes also did not have any preparation, only a legal price. According to this legal price, every 50,000 Rubles issued in 1923 could be exchanged for one gold Ruble; and the Rubles issued in 1923 were equal to 1 million old Rubles issued before 1923. From this, it can be seen that when the Soviet Russian government recovered the old Rubles in 1924, the value of the old Rubles had fallen below 50 million times (according to Lawton, An Economic History of Soviet Russia). However, this phenomenon of being worthless does not truly reflect his external exchange rate. The exchange rate for US dollars is even more expensive than the parity price. It was not until the old Rubles began to be recovered at the official price set on March 10, 1924 that it fell a little, but it was still above the parity price, and it has remained unchanged ever since. Although the exchange rate for British pounds once shrunk below the parity price, it immediately rebounded. It is shown in the following table

Ruble Exchange Rate from 1924 to 1925

Date Exchange Rate for British Pounds Exchange Rate for US Dollars

Parity Price 9.458 Rubles per Pound 1.94 Rubles per US Dollar

January 1, 1924 9.40 2.20

April 1, 1924 8.36 1.945

July 1, 1924 8. 1 1.945

October 1, 1924 8.67 1.945

January 1, 1925 9.17 1.945

April 1, 1925 9.25 1.945

July 1, 1925 9.435 1.945

(Note) According to Narodny bank Monthly Review Nay.1931. The unit is Ruble.

The domestic value of the Ruble has fallen sharply, but the international value has not changed much; and once it is rectified, its domestic value will immediately rebound and quickly return to normal. If the prices of 1913 are used as 100 points, then his wholesale price on October 1, 1924 was only 164.3 points; the retail price was only 203 points. In other words; the former is only 64.3% more expensive than before the war, and the latter is only 103% more expensive than before the war. This is probably unexpected for people who only know historical phenomena but do not understand historical facts!

This is certainly not a miracle, nor a natural phenomenon, but the result of human intervention by the Soviet Russian government. In other words: this is also the development of the spiritual power of the Soviet Russian people. All classical monetary theories, all gold-worshiping monetary theories, they simply do not understand the determining relationship of today's international exchange rates. Therefore, although the nominal value of the Ruble fell sharply with the evil expansion of issuance, their actual international balance of payments still adhered to the legal parity price. Therefore, the "purchasing power parity theory" was produced in the international exchange study after the war, believing that the main factor determining international exchange rates lies in the balance of international trade, not in whether the currency material and the currency value are balanced? Then there is no reason for the current decline in the black market price of foreign exchange in our country, where wartime trade is improving.

"Natural Level" and "Artificial Level"

Perhaps there are now many people studying: "Is the current 3.5 pence for the British pound and 4.6875 yuan for the US dollar the new natural level"? Some may even be studying: "How long will this level be stable"?

According to their speculative experience, speculators imagine that the so-called "natural level" must be an exchange rate that is lower than before. Therefore, every time the black market exchange rate experiences a trend, a new so-called "natural level" is produced; and each new "natural level" always shrinks the black market price by 10% to 20%. I think this is an insult to the "natural level". The spokesperson of the Ministry of Finance hopes that the black market exchange rate will produce a "natural level" in free fluctuations. If he also regards the lower exchange rate as the "natural level", it is really an incomparable mistake!

According to the above-mentioned key to determining international exchange rates, the main factor determining international exchange rates is not whether the currency material and the currency value are balanced, but whether the commodity trade is balanced. And if you want to study the trend of commodity trade balance, you should measure the trend of wartime trade according to the statutory exchange rate of one shilling and two and a half pence. If you calculate according to the black market price, the result you get is only a currency phenomenon, only a price phenomenon, not the truth of commodity trade. Only from the truth of commodity trade can we discover how the main factors determining the exchange rate are changing, so we can judge whether the current black market exchange rate is reasonable? Whether it conforms to the meaning of the so-called "natural level"?

If this theory is correct, then the trend of our country's wartime trade balance is not worse than before the war, but even has great progress compared with before the war. This progress is definitely not a blind blow, because the new construction during the war is enough to offset part of the destruction under the artillery fire, and high prices naturally save part of the consumption. If the situation in the inland is not enough to represent the situation in the whole country, then we might as well take a step back and take Shanghai's foreign trade in the occupied areas as an example. Shanghai's trade has always accounted for more than half of the total trade in the country. Then the actual performance of Shanghai's trade balance should have a powerful impact on the trend of international exchange rates. (This section is also not finished)

### Coal Market with Big Rise and Small Fall

The local climate is hot, and since the war, the communist coal mines have been located in the occupied areas, and transportation has been blocked. They have had to reduce their supply and give priority to imported foreign coal for supply. Therefore, the rise and fall of the market depends on the contraction of the exchange market. The orders change in the morning and evening, and the rise and fall are unpredictable. When the shilling shrank sharply on the second of this month, the coal market even closed for a day that day, and overnight orders were implicitly cancelled (so there were countless disputes caused by repentance on that day). The next day, various goods such as smoke and white coal were all demolished in the collective market, and each ton rose by 50 to 60 yuan (equivalent to 30% to 40% of the board). Considering the situation, the daily inventory in this city is no less than 100,000 tons, all of which are low-cost. The price should not rise as soon as it gets wind, but the owners insist that the cost is important and the supply of goods will be cut off in the future. They insist on their own way and implement the means of taking advantage of the fire to rob and take the opportunity to raise prices.

Until recently, the finance has gradually become stable, and the foreign exchange has gradually loosened. The US dollar has risen from 4.125 yuan to 5.53125 yuan. Various foreign goods have invisibly reduced the cost of goods by 30%, and will return to the original state of the previous month. It should rise if it has risen, and it should be reduced if it should be reduced. Moreover, according to the current exchange rate calculation, at a minimum, it must also be reduced by two-thirds of the previous rise to be reasonable. However, the owners do not plan to do this. When they hear that the shilling is shrinking, they change the orders in the morning and evening, fearing that the price increase will not be fast. Recently, the foreign exchange has gradually loosened, and the cost has been reduced, but they turn a deaf ear to it, intending to wait and see, and stick to the original board without cutting the code. Therefore, is it "limited by cost"? Or "is there a risk of supply interruption"? According to this week, the foreign coal from Kolkata, India, Indochina, and French Annam. Each cargo of Hongji. Smoke and white coal is no less than 30,000 tons, and the supply is normal, and the shipping is unimpeded. × Coal is not even included. The so-called "source cutoff" is only said that among them, one or two coal merchants are slightly sensible and automatically reduce the board, but it is also a big rise and a small fall, which is not thorough (that is, taking Hongji white coal as an example, the price rose from 170 yuan to 230 yuan last week, an increase of 60 yuan per ton, about 60%. Although 14 yuan of the board has been created recently, it is still less than one-fourth. Other coals such as Indian smoke coal are still planning to maintain a high board of 300 yuan, but the market is weak, and people are looking down. The secret board is reduced by 20 yuan, but there is still no receiver. The coal market situation is already visible). After all, the end of the strong crossbow is difficult to continue, so it is hoped that the coal industry can make plans as soon as possible, reduce it automatically, and do not delay and miss the opportunity, resulting in "losing the wife and losing the army".

As for the coal ball industry, because it is a common fuel for civilians, it is even more attention-grabbing. In one ten-day period, it has fallen by four boards in a row, reducing the board by 24 yuan. The retail price of each dan in the door and village has also been reduced by 1.2 yuan. With increases and decreases, it is also a legitimate procedure for merchants. (Pei)

### Weak Market for Foreign Coal ——People Look Down——

Although the shilling for various foreign coal goods has been loosening recently, one or two traders hold on to their prejudices, hoping to profit from it, and still stick to the original board for the discount, unwilling to cut the code. Indian smoke coal is still making a top board of 300 yuan, but the market is weak, and people are looking down. The secret board is reduced by more than 20 yuan, urgently seeking to be released, but there is still no receiver. Other coals such as Borneo coal have fallen to 270 yuan, and there are no major transactions. The real reason is that street customers intend to wait and see, measure their income and expenditure, and are unwilling to enter more, and the traders intend to hold on, which further promotes the sluggishness of the stomach.

### Red Sugar Falls the Most

Yesterday, the sugar market continued to trend downward. The association drew the board. The spot price of No. 24 coarse sand white at the outer warehouse was 71.5 yuan, a small 7 cents. The new goods of Taikoo Chebai B mark were 84.5 yuan, a small 5 cents. The old goods of Cambodian warehouse were 83 yuan. The H mark red sugar was 61.6 yuan to 60.5 yuan, a small 2.5 yuan. The Dutch red sugar was 65 yuan to 64.5 yuan, a small 1.5 yuan.

### Indian Silver Futures and Spot Rise

Mumbai Electric on the 18th, the spot price of silver in the Indian silver market rose by 4 annas, and the futures price rose by 3 annas. The market was stable and firm, and a total of 100 orders were transacted. The British and American silver markets were closed for holidays and there was no telegram.

### Sluggish Sales of Lead and Tin

Pig Lead: Sales have always been most extensive through tea merchant guilds. Additionally, local paint companies, litharge factories, type foundries, tin foil factories, printing houses, newspapers, etc., also constitute significant outlets. However, recently, transactions through tea merchant guilds have become increasingly rare, and local consumption has also stagnated. Although actual sales in the market are clear, prices are exceptionally firm due to cost factors. Currently, the market price is estimated at around 135 yuan per picul. It is noted that only about a hundred piculs were traded on the market yesterday.

Tin: Yesterday, only shipyards, machine factories, and other entities scavenged for over ten piculs in the market. Merchants from Shaoxing also purchased about thirty to forty piculs. Actual transactions were not particularly enthusiastic, so the market sentiment remains sluggish. However, market sentiment remains firm as sources are scarce and inventories in Shanghai are not abundant. Small refined tin is quoted at 1,200 yuan, and Dutch tin at 1,300 yuan.

### The Wuxi Rice and Flour Market is Dim

Rice Market: Market fluctuations have been erratic in recent days, making it difficult even for experienced professionals to predict market changes. Due to the sharp rise in foreign exchange rates in Shanghai, general hoarding households in Wuxi have been actively selling samples, but buyers are scarce, leading to price reductions to expedite sales. Rice prices have fallen by more than two yuan, paddy rice by six or seven jiao, and high-quality powdered indica rice is at 31.5 yuan per stone. High-quality indica paddy is at 14.7 or 14.8 yuan per dan. On the 17th, market prices tightened, buyers became more active, and prices rebounded by half a yuan. High-quality powdered white indica rice is at 32 yuan per stone, medium-quality powdered white rice at 31.6 yuan, high-quality brown indica rice at 30 yuan, high-quality indica paddy at 15.2 yuan per dan, and standard paddy at 14.2 or 14.3 yuan.

Flour: Sales have been sluggish due to the significant easing of foreign exchange rates in Shanghai. Current market prices for flour are at 12.7 yuan per bag. With the imminent arrival of new wheat, flour prices are expected to decline. (Liang)

### Old Newspaper Re-copied: Sixty-seven Years Ago (389) (See the Tongzhi 12th Year Edition of the Qing Dynasty)

Martyr

There is a woman named Ning in a farming family in Baitangkou, near Tianjin, betrothed to a son of the Zhang family in Shuangjing. According to the system that an unmarried woman cannot be considered Zhang's wife, it can be said that she is a Zhang's wife. This spring, Zhang died. When the woman heard the bad news, she almost wanted to die. She asked her mother in front of her to go through the door to observe chastity, but her mother loved her daughter very much and did not allow it. Later, the woman asked more vigorously, and the aunts and sisters persuaded her, but the woman's words became more severe and her determination became stronger. The Zhang family was poor, and some people mediated for her, allowing the woman to go through the door to mourn, and then return to her mother's knees, so that she could see Zhang's desolation and cool her initial heart. The woman followed her ceremony, with a bundle of fresh grass, and her appearance was like jade, and she actually went to mourn, and the sadness of her tears almost moved passers-by. Although she wore plain white clothes when she left, after she arrived, she suddenly rushed to the filial piety curtain, changed into the clothes of a widow, and was willing to observe chastity to the end. Zhang's mother politely refused, saying why she was so bitter to herself. The woman begged to stay on the ground, and Ning's mother knew that her daughter would not turn back, so she let her go back to Zhang's, so that she could fulfill her wish. However, Zhang was eventually burdened by poverty, and one more mouth to feed was a waste of hesitation. She didn't want a widow in her family, which would increase the daily supply. The woman slightly peeked at her privacy, saying that her aunt wanted a daughter-in-law, why not follow her husband, vowed to cut off food and die for her husband. Her mother urged her to eat more, but the woman ignored her. There was a Fanjun in the township who heard about it, and accompanied the gentry to persuade her to advance. She only took a sip of water and died after a few counts. Shuangjing is only five miles away from Baitangkou, and relatives from both families came to mourn, all praising the woman's chastity. Those who have not yet warmed their bones and separated their quilts, what should they do!

### Mr. Chen Xuyuan's Impression on Me

— Cheng Xiaoqing

——Written for Today’s Ningbo Hometown Association Memorial Service——

Mr. Xuyuan has passed away. I don't want to make any systematic account of his life's words, deeds, and career here, or to exaggerate it. I just want to briefly gather some of the impressions he has given me for more than 20 years, in order to express my admiration for him:

(1) Fighting Spirit: Mr. Xuyuan was engaged in business in his early years as a young master, such as printing houses and bookstores, but all ended in failure. But he was not discouraged. Although his alias "Tianxu Wo Sheng" seems to have some meaning of "indignation" because he was not used by the world, he only used it to encourage himself, and did not become passive because of this. Later, he used the path of "writing" as a transition, and finally indirectly achieved his grand wish of "aspiring to industry." With bare hands, he established a small fortress for the motherland to recover its rights - the Family Industry Society.

(2) Tireless Learning: He is a person who has a deep research on Chinese studies, and can be said to be a complete layman in Western science. But he is tireless and not afraid of "learning boxing at the age of eighty." He is willing to study and explore all the sciences and principles related to industrial manufacturing - not limited to cosmetics - until he can understand and apply them. Once, I saw an Yi Jing spread out on his desk, and he was diligently annotating it in the midst of his busy schedule.

(3) Answer Every Question: His love of learning and knowledge seems not only to satisfy his personal desire for knowledge, nor is it to use learning as a stepping stone to achieve his personal goal of "getting rich." He has an attitude of "already achieved people, reaching others" as Confucius said. His learning is "for others," "for society," and "for the country." Therefore, no matter whether he is familiar or unfamiliar, as long as he sincerely asks him for advice, he always "knows everything and says everything." I think his articles on "teaching people tirelessly" and "inducing people step by step," published in the Shen Bao "Food, Clothing, Housing and Transportation Weekly" and other magazines, have long been appreciated by everyone, and I don't want to say more here.

I believe that the three points mentioned above have a "worth considering" value for the general youth. Because the three points are the basic conditions for being a "person". Otherwise, no matter how high a person's social status or how great his reputation is during his lifetime, if he is only for himself or his family, then he is just a "walking corpse," and I am unwilling to waste meaningless ink.

### Discussing Socks

— Shen Fu

Every time I see the phrase "clothing, food, housing, and transportation," I always see a "discuss" character. Either "discussing shoes," or "discussing cloth," even discussing "buttons." Therefore, I might as well discuss "socks"!

Socks are an indispensable clothing accessory in daily life. Nowadays, most people like to wear silk stockings. Just think, what are the benefits of wearing silk stockings? They are neither economical nor durable, merely wasting money and gaining a bit of beauty. Recently, prices have soared, and silk stockings cannot be bought for one or two yuan. I think it is better to wear cotton socks. They are not only durable but also simple. Isn't that also practicing the new lifestyle? But machine-knitted cotton socks also cost seven or eight jiao a pair, how can we not cherish wearing them! Therefore, we must take good care of them. It is best to change and wash them every day, or change and wash them every other day, because frequent washing and changing can keep the feet clean and prevent the occurrence of dampness-related diseases. It can also prevent the socks from being corroded by foot sweat. If there is a small hole, it should be mended that night, otherwise, "a small hole not mended will lead to great suffering," to the point where they can no longer be worn, which would be a pity. Now, as spring and summer are transitioning and the weather is gradually getting hotter, many people (especially women) are going bare-legged without wearing socks. This method is not only in line with the trend of the times but can also save on sock expenses, truly killing two birds with one stone.

### A Penetrating Insight

— A Jin

No one values you for wearing luxurious clothes except for fools. (Lord Avebury)

Those who love delicacies may soon become beggars. (Benjamin Franklin)

Excessive drinking is merely voluntary madness. (Seneca)

Health is the greatest of all possessions; a pale-faced cobbler is better than a sick king. (Begsdeth)

He who feasts every day, feasts no day. (Simms)

The drunkard is fit for any wickedness. (Quarles)

He that destroys his constitution by irregular living, is manifestly a felo de se. (Sherlock)

### Yuanbao Basket

— Wang Yongtao

The term "Yuanbao Basket," I'm sure few of you know it. Now let me explain it! It is an ancient transportation tool in Ningbo; woven from bamboo strips, its form is like a cradle. There are two bamboo poles on both sides, which are for the porters to carry.

There is no top on the basket. Passengers need to hold their own parasols to shield themselves from the sun. There are cotton cushions in the basket, so passengers sit inside very comfortably.

Every scenic spot in Ningbo has these facilities. Before the war, the Jade Emperor Temple, Tiantong Temple, and Fenghua's Xueshi Temple, the bus stations, were lined up one after another. As soon as the bus arrived, they would come up to solicit business. Although it is not as lively as before the war, the business is still doing quite well!

Yuanbao baskets also have other uses, because in remote rural areas, once someone is ill, if they want to seek medical treatment, there is no car to hire, nor a rickshaw to ride. Although a sedan chair can be used, it is not suitable for patients to ride in. Therefore, the only alternative is the Yuanbao basket. Because people can lie down inside!

### Avoiding Fire Disasters

— Shaonong

According to the Fire Brigade's report, there were 1,100 fires in Shanghai last year, which shows how serious the problem of fire is in Shanghai today. This article is an original work by Howard Copeland Hill in "Social Life and Public Issues." Hill is the head of the Sociology Department at the University of Chicago in the United States. The fire prevention methods he described, although for the United States, are essentially the same for any country. Now, I will translate it as follows:

When the US government decided to build sixteen new cities in 1918 to house the new National Guard, fire insurance companies immediately felt that this plan was very dangerous. In order to defeat the enemy, they volunteered to serve in the camps to reduce the chance of fire. Therefore, hundreds of yards of open space were left between each building, and large water supply devices were built. Each building was equipped with fire buckets and other fire extinguishing equipment. Firefighters were meticulously trained. Wires and heaters were constructed according to scientific methods. As a result, no fire losses were suffered in each camp.

If ordinary people were also so attentive, the loss from fires would be greatly reduced. The punishment of the negligent by law is indeed effective. In European countries, if his property is destroyed by fire due to negligence, then he is regarded as a criminal. If his negligence causes damage to his neighbors, then he must do his best to pay for the loss, and sometimes he must be imprisoned. Therefore, the number of negligent incidents has indeed decreased a lot. Of course, the law is very effective for society.

Using matches, fireworks, kerosene, and volatile oil carefully, and removing debris and various flammable materials can also help reduce a large part of the loss. If a fire breaks out, the most important thing is not to panic, but to adhere to a few small points; such as closing windows tightly to prevent flames from entering, staying close to the floor to avoid smoke, and covering your head with a damp cloth when passing through a smoke-filled room.

The National Fire Protection Association also prints fire prevention regulations: 1. There must be coverings over exposed fires (such as wall stoves, etc.). 2. Do not put dry clothes too close to the stove. 3. Bundle up old newspapers and sell them at any time. 4. Never put burning ashes into wooden containers. 5. Put oily substances into metal cans. 6. Do not accumulate loose debris.

### Utilizing Summer Time for Exercise

— Xin Meng

Recently, foreigners in Shanghai are promoting a movement to save daylight time in summer. The so-called "utilizing" and "saving" daylight time in summer is because the days are long in summer, dawn breaks very early, and the afternoons are long and tiring. Therefore, it is advocated to increase office hours by one hour in the morning and reduce them by one hour in the afternoon.

This principle has been approved by the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession. Many companies and foreign firms throughout Shanghai will implement it from June 1 to the end of September. In this way, you can get up early in the first half of the day, and have enough rest time in the second half of the day to recover from work fatigue and improve health. This plan has been tried in the United States for many years and has achieved considerable results.

Perhaps smaller retail stores believe that their business will be hit after this plan is implemented. But according to the results of experiments in England, this is completely incorrect; on the contrary, due to the promotion of the summer time exercise movement, some retail stores have even better business. Because it allows office workers to have more time to browse the windows, instead of rushing home for dinner. However, on the other hand, we must know that reducing office hours by one hour in the afternoon is intended to allow you to find appropriate rest, such as going to the park; visiting the library, etc. If you go to dance halls and singing halls, it will violate the original intention of promoting the use of summer daylight time.

### "Travel" Safety (Continued)

According to another sailor who took this ship to the Netherlands, when the "Bei" ship was bombed, the author happened to be taking a bath and took off his shirt. He escaped in a hurry upon hearing the alarm, and did not have time to retrieve the money he was carrying with him. At the same time, small valuables such as watches and fountain pens were looted in an instant. And the safe on the ship had also been pried open by someone, and valuables were easily taken. At this critical moment, someone took the opportunity to loot, and among these looters, it was completely unexpected that this ship, although bombed, did not sink after all.

It has been found that this ship was bombed on the ocean, but was spared the sacrifice of most lives, which is several times safer than traveling in China, in addition to the crew's calm cultivation, but also relies on the following equipment. (1) Motorized lifeboats that are easy to resist wind and waves. The number is large and all are ready, and inside are stored emergency rations and other items. (2) Each ship is equipped with two heavy life-saving floats that can hold up to sixteen people to avoid drowning. The edge of the disc is raised, shaped like a rubber wheel, but made of canvas, and filled with Kapok, obtained from the fruit shells of the Java silk-cotton tree. The Kapok is rough in color, and Westerners use it to fill pillows. It is very light and not easily damp, which is conducive to floating. (3) Non-tilting floating apparatus. Each ship has one, which is made by nailing countless empty oil barrels that are easy to float around the top and bottom of the wooden board, and connecting the board edges outside the oil barrels with strong ropes, so that those who fall into the water can drag the ropes and climb the board surface surrounding the oil barrels. (4) Life jackets that are half the number of people on the whole ship plus half. (Also called life vests.) (5) Wireless telegraph alarm equipment. (6) Anti-aircraft masks. As the saying goes, raising soldiers for a thousand days is for use in one day. It is impossible to sail a ship without tools to prevent danger, just as it is impossible to establish a country in the world without national defense, and it is impossible to ensure the safety of a city without police. In an autumn of numerous difficulties, it is different from a peaceful day. Chinese sailors cross thousands of miles of ocean and penetrate minefields, bravely and calmly, becoming the "glory of maritime service." How can the degree of safety be better than the "thousand-gold sons" in China? The gains and losses in this are not entirely related to the depth of knowledge of the shipping authorities. All new things in China learn from the West, and it is absolutely not allowed to miss one or two, so that those who mislead others turn to mislead themselves. From ancient times to the present, whoever seeks greater convenience must consider the disadvantages in the benefits, and plan for preventing the disadvantages. Therefore, the above-mentioned various "weapons" for ensuring the safety of the public in China will surely follow all new facilities and prosper together, and will surely become a kind of industry with good prospects in the future world. The enlightened people in the world should not urgently plan for it. (End)

### One Week Economic Menu

— Hua Ying Ms.

Pomfret has been on the market for a month, and the price has gradually decreased in the past few days: the large ones are about eight cents per tael, which is comparable to pork. Although pomfret is said to be aristocratic, it is now the same price as pork. Since meat already has its place in my economic menu, then pomfret can certainly participate as well. I don't like pomfret very much, but the master of my house loves to eat it very much. With pomfret, he can eat half a bowl more rice, so I always have to spend forty cents a day to buy five taels, divide it into two pieces, and put them in two bowls for steaming, adding some diced lard. Fortunately, the children are gentle with their chopsticks, and everyone has tasted the new ones. The beauty of pomfret lies entirely in the scales, so other fish must have their scales removed, but only pomfret cannot have its scales removed. There are two ways to cook it: steaming and braising, but if you want to eat it fresh and tender, steaming is better.

Spring and Autumn

### Where are you going (2)

"Where are you going?" The main point of this question is not referring to the fact that you have finished your life's work, the sun is about to set, and where you are going. This question of future destiny is indeed important, but if we currently encourage ourselves to be good people, this future question will naturally be solved accordingly. Therefore, this question essentially means, where are you going now? What habits do you have? What ideals and attitudes do you hold towards God and people? What ideals and attitudes do you hold towards yourself? If, from now on, you follow the current direction, where will you reach in ten or thirty years? In general, not many people change their behavior after graduating from university. A certain gentleman said it well, "What we are now, we will be in the future." Our habits and attitudes have all been formed. Now, please tell me, where is the path to life leading you? Are you acting according to ideals, or according to impulses? Are you following the path of greed, or the path of generosity? Are you using others, or sharing their joys and sorrows? Are you drifting with the wind, or climbing upwards? Are you a Christian, or a non-Christian? The way we live now will inevitably determine our future achievements. The scripture says, "What a man sows, that shall he also reap." Therefore, the key is not where you come from, but where you are going now. Many people who study psychology but lack a foundation in philosophy say that life is a machine. However, we believe otherwise. We maintain that people are responsible for their own actions. Those who intentionally break the law and kill are often punished according to the law. Naturally, we cannot underestimate the influence of the environment, but when the situation is set, the power to change the path of life rests with ourselves. We can make choices regarding various different lifestyles and methods of behavior. John Prickard of America once said a famous saying a hundred years ago, he said, "Whoever allows themselves to be hijacked by the world is equal to allowing themselves to be directed by the world." Many people's behaviors are like this. Conversely, those who refuse to do what the world does cannot be controlled by the world. The president of Harvard University once said, "The most important point in educating young people to be good citizens today is to teach them how to resist meaningless propaganda." If young people know where they are going and are determined to achieve that noble goal, then they must pick up their walking stick to oppose the push of the masses, or cunning propaganda, and cultivate the strength to go their own way.

### Future Relief Work

— Qian Che

The refugees in Shanghai's various shelters will be scattered before the end of this month. The future of these compatriots, old fathers, sisters, brothers and children whose fields are barren and families are broken, is something I dare not speculate about. The gentlemen of the Refugee Association have exhausted their minds and exerted their strength, running around and calling for help for them for so long, but finally, due to insufficient funding, they have come up with this last resort. Their heartfelt pain must be even greater than ours.

The creation of this tragic fact is, of course, due to the gradual decrease in donations. The so-called compassion that everyone has is now long gone with the sound of cannons, and it has intensified. Grasping economic authority, speculating and manipulating, this one advocates and that one echoes, creating an unprecedented tragedy on the "isolated island." The lives of ordinary citizens are precarious, who else will care about the lives of refugees! Fortunately, the relief gentlemen have used both soft and hard tactics, not only using entertainment to raise funds widely, but also collecting refugee donations to supplement it. It is already very difficult for the relief funds to be maintained until today.

However, in fact, relief work also has its shortcomings. For example, the "expanding refugee production movement" that was shouted for a while, although there were several exhibition of products, the result had to be considered a failure. Even more unfortunately, many refugees, because they sit and eat comfortably, have developed their inertia, which is inevitable to give people an excuse and create obstacles to relief work.

The past is gone, the future can be pursued. For the remaining disabled, old, weak, widows and orphans, we can no longer treat them the same as before. This is the hope that the relief gentlemen should make overall calculations as soon as possible, although this work is bound to be more difficult. At the same time, there is one more point that cannot be said, that is, the expenditure of the "Relief Association" itself must be frugal as much as possible, and no money can be wasted, because in the future, the relief funds will probably only come from the refugee donation income.

### Calling on Schools with Missed Classes to Strive for Remediation

— Liyan

Time flies like running water, and the summer vacation at the end of the academic year is coming soon. From the autumn semester to the summer vacation, among the 52 weeks in a year, excluding various statutory holidays and personal class suspensions (such as school anniversaries, and exhibitions, competitions, visits, etc.), the actual number of days for studying is very small, especially for students on isolated islands. Due to the special environment, the classrooms are economical, and when encountering teachers who take leave at will, the homework is further discounted, which is really very little.

Logically, schools should teach the progress of various subjects according to the procedures stipulated by the Ministry of Education. There is a certain standard for what level a certain subject should be taught each year. However, some schools have unsound organizations, do not carefully select teachers, and there are often changes in personnel. Teachers are often changed, and classes are often missed. In addition, the winter vacation starts earlier than other families and the school starts later than other families. During the winter vacation, students can still attribute the fact that the books have not been taught according to the planned progress to driving fast in the next semester to finish them. Now that the summer vacation is coming soon, if you do not quickly mend the fold after losing the sheep, and let it be missing all the time, the students will not have enough numbers. Then, whether it is upgrading, transferring schools, or taking exams, the level is too insufficient, and the students are too disadvantaged. It seems that the school authorities should take some responsibility.

Therefore, I feel that while there is still more than a month before the start of the summer vacation, for the sake of the students' studies in all levels of schools in Shanghai, I request the enlightened authorities of Shanghai schools to carefully estimate and count whether some major courses have been missed too much due to various personnel issues in the past, and have not met the legal schedule; if so, now we must quickly make overall plans and strive for remedial measures, using various holidays and extra time, and even slightly extending the school term and shortening the summer vacation, so that students can make up for the courses they should learn in a school year, so that there are no deficiencies. This is not only worthy of the students and their families, but also the responsibility that should be fulfilled in one's personal duties. I hope that the enlightened school authorities can accept and implement this humble opinion.

### Don't Be a Teacher

— Qiao

Mr. Li Ziru of the former generation once wrote a couplet to describe the life of a teacher:

In the sad night rain, under the plantain window, lighting half a lamp, correcting the particles of the students.

Looking back at the autumn wind and laurel courtyard, only a bald pen remains, planning for the family's firewood, rice, oil and salt.

Mr. Xia Gaizun also wrote a couplet himself:

It's better to die early than to suffer,

There's nothing I can do but be a teacher because I'm poor.

Now someone is writing the following couplet:

It's better to die early,

Don't be a teacher!

### After the Rain, the Sky Clears

— Bao Tianxiao

Chapter 24: The Lakes and Mountains are Washed, Each with Its Own Charm, Men and Women Cheer Together and Shout Long Live

They sat for a while in the Freedom Village Elementary School, and Zhu Airen said: "The old grandfather means to stay for dinner." Zhu Ai said again: "However, we are far from the countryside here, and there is nothing delicious to eat. It is really very simple. But the countryside also has its own flavor. It is not bad to eat a meal occasionally and change the taste. I want to invite everyone to appreciate the light." Mrs. Suriya listened and applauded her approval first. She is the most frank American wife. When people want to be polite a few more times, she has already agreed, and there is nothing to say. Zhu Airen then said: "Let's go and see the factory site together at this moment." Everyone still took the family travel car, at that time there was one more Mr. Zhu in the car. It is not far from going to the elementary school, a piece of land near the canal is only seven or eight acres in size. If you want to develop it, there are still twenty or thirty acres to expand into it. On the opposite side of the canal is Water Bamboo Village. If you want to go to the opposite Water Bamboo Village, there is a Xie Martyr Temple about a mile away from here, which was built to commemorate Xie Martyr who died in the Anti-Japanese War during the war. You have to go around this bridge to reach the neighboring village. Lin Jiancheng was very satisfied after looking at this Guan address, he said: "Although land transportation is very developed in China now, water transportation is even more convenient. There are seven or eight acres of land along the river here, which is probably enough. If it is not enough, you can also expand it at any time, there are still twenty or thirty miles, you have also ordered a priority right to lease the land." The factory building is planned to be built with three floors, including warehouses, workers' dormitories, offices, wharves, etc. In addition, isn't the father of the two Miss He, Mr. He, going to build a villa? This villa must not necessarily be along the river, because he just dislikes Shanghai being too noisy, so he wants to live in the village and take it a little quieter. Moreover, the area does not have to be too large, and there is no need to build any gardens. One or two acres of land is enough." Lin Jiancheng based on its address, used his notebook to draw a rough sketch first, to get a general idea, and then planned in detail. It turned out that Village Chief Zhu was indeed an old gentleman after all, and he wanted to preserve the rural style of this Freedom Village. But from Lin Jiancheng's point of view, judging from the environment of Freedom Village and its trend, it is obvious that Freedom Village will become a new industrial village. Because since China's post-war recovery, it has gradually changed from an agricultural country to a country that attaches equal importance to agriculture and industry, like the United States and Soviet Russia. Many inland areas are improving agriculture and promoting animal husbandry, while more open areas, such as Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, are experiencing a booming industry. They can't accommodate many factories in large metropolitan areas, and they naturally disperse to the nearby towns and villages. (Eight Two)
