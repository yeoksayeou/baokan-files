### French Troops Reorganize Their Lines; German Troops Enter Paris; German Troops Advance South in the Champagne Region; French Military Authorities Determined to Resist to the End

Washington - The State Department has just received a telegram from U.S. Ambassador to France, Bullitt, stating that German troops have already entered Paris. (Havas, 14th)

New York - It is learned that news of the entry of German troops into Paris was reported by U.S. Ambassador to France, Bullitt (who remains in Paris), by telephone at 6:00 AM this morning (Greenwich time, which is 3:00 PM Shanghai time) to the Polish Ambassador to France, Patek (currently in Tours, southern France), who then telegraphed the State Department six minutes later. (Havas, 14th)

Somewhere in France - The Commander-in-Chief issued a war bulletin this morning stating, "Enemy troops are advancing rapidly around the outskirts of Paris. Our defending forces have been ordered to withdraw, and Paris has been declared an undefended city. Defending it would only devastate the area and would be of no strategic benefit. As for the front lines in the Champagne region, enemy troops are advancing south. One advance unit appears to be moving towards Romilly (on the Seine River), while another is moving towards Saint-Thierry (on the Marne River). Our troops' operations and movements are orderly and unhurried." (Havas, 14th)
A French army spokesman announced this evening that Paris would be abandoned to avoid devastation, but that French troops would set up defenses south of the city and reorganize their lines to continue the war. Military observers say that German troops have been attacking continuously for ten days and ten nights. The French troops have suffered heavy losses and are extremely fatigued. Supply and replenishment are proving very difficult. Without reinforcements, the defensive positions south of the Seine River may be difficult to hold for long. (Havas, 13th)

Paris - It is reported that the French cabinet met last night and decided to continue resistance to the end. (Reuters, 14th)

Paris - The Supreme Military Council has decided that even if the Germans cross the Seine and advance towards Versailles with three times the number of French troops, the French army will still fight to the end. It is reported that British reinforcements will soon arrive at the front to join forces with the French army. (International News Service, 14th) The French General Headquarters issued a war bulletin this evening stating, "The fighting around Paris is becoming increasingly fierce. (1) To the west, fresh enemy troops are attacking south of Rouen. Their motorized troops have already reached the bridgeheads of Louviers and Vernon, and are advancing towards Pacy-sur-Eure and Évreux. Évreux and Dreux have been bombed by enemy aircraft. (2) To the north, at least twelve enemy divisions are attacking between Senlis and Betz. (3) To the east, enemy armored divisions have crossed the Marne River between Château-Thierry and Dormans, advancing towards Montmirail. Other enemy divisions are advancing east of Reims towards Châlons-sur-Marne. In all, the enemy has an estimated one hundred divisions from the coast to the Meuse River. Our troops, although fewer in number, are bravely resisting." (Havas, 13th)

London - Although the situation in the abandoned suburbs of Paris is serious, the general public is most concerned about the precarious situation of the French troops south of Reims. According to a Reuters correspondent, German troops in that area, reinforced by armored divisions, are trying to isolate the Maginot Line from General Weygand's mobile forces. Unfortunately, the terrain there is similar to undulating plains, suitable for tank warfare. If bombers cannot stop the German armored vehicles, the German forces in that area will become a serious threat. German troop movements elsewhere on the front are being severely disrupted by the constant activity of the Royal Air Force. German heavy artillery near Saint-Valery has fallen silent. A French communique acknowledged the abandonment of Paris, stating that due to increased German pressure, the troops covering Paris had withdrawn to both sides of the city as ordered. (Reuters, 14th)

Paris - A spokesman for the French Army announced that the French General Headquarters had no intention of fighting within Paris. If French troops were forced to continue retreating, they would engage in battle in the suburbs north of Paris and then reorganize continuous lines of defense immediately behind Paris. The French army is now resisting with the greatest determination, but they are facing an enemy that is superior in numbers, weapons, and aircraft. Many French divisions have been fighting for ten days without rest, while the Germans have reinforcements every two or three days. Physical fatigue is now having an impact, especially during combat. Most troops often have to defend distances of up to sixty miles. The spokesman added that French losses were quite heavy and that it was not possible to send reinforcements. (Reuters, 14th)

Berlin - Officials here announced this morning that German troops have now entered Paris. (Haitong, 14th)

Berlin - At 1:00 PM today, the German people joyfully listened to the broadcast announcing the German occupation of Paris. Everyone raised flags to celebrate. Führer Hitler issued an order for the entire country to fly flags for three days to show respect for German soldiers. Churches throughout Germany rang their bells for fifteen minutes, and people gathered in the streets, singing the national anthem and forgetting their fatigue. (Haitong News Agency, 14th)

Berlin - Le Havre has been occupied by German troops. (Haitong News Agency, 14th)

### Large Unit of Italian Troops Head to Germany for Reinforcement

London - A Reuters military correspondent reports that, according to unofficial sources, a large unit of Italian troops arrived in Germany some days ago, indicating that Italy is indeed participating in the war because the German side needs reinforcements. (Reuters, 14th)

### French Government Moves to Bordeaux

New York - British radio has just reported that the French government has moved from Tours to Bordeaux. (United Press, 14th)

Editorial

### Handling Food Shortages During the Lean Season

Recently, rice prices have once again shown an upward trend, with japonica rice being hoarded particularly severely, reaching over sixty yuan on the black market. Although foreign rice has arrived from time to time, it is also selling for fifty-five or fifty-six yuan. Flour is selling for thirteen yuan and eight jiao on this street, while sales to customers have already reached over sixteen yuan. This is the staple food of the people, and we have indeed re-entered a dangerous area. Some consider this to be a natural phenomenon, as we have already reached the lean season. The seasonal trend of the Shanghai rice market has been for prices to gradually rise in June and July, and then gradually decrease in October. Moreover, the situation this year cannot be compared with previous years. According to historical rice prices, although prices rise in this season in a timely manner, flour prices are adjusted invisibly because the wheat harvest has been completed. However, this year, although the new wheat has been harvested, flour mills cannot obtain new wheat, or the amount available is limited. This is because "control" has created a monopoly, making procurement difficult and transportation extremely uncertain. The mechanized flour industry yesterday appealed to the Public Works Department, attempting to increase the price of flour sold on this street. There are those who can find excuses for this. Since flour prices are not reduced with the arrival of new wheat, the actual severity of the situation is that it has lost its function of adjusting the people's food supply, which affects the rice market. This is not just about the price of rice in Shanghai rising steadily. It is said that rice prices in the Ningbo-Shaoxing area are as high as over one hundred yuan, because Ningbo-Shaoxing is a region with a dense population and scarce grain, relying on the rivers and seas for supply. Now, the river crossing between Hangzhou and Haining has been interrupted, and maritime transport between Shanghai and Ningbo is mostly obstructed. In addition, Xiaoshan has fallen, and Japanese troops are gathering, requisitioning grain on the spot, which is enough to deprive the people of food. It is appropriate for grain prices to rise. Rice prices in the Hangzhou-Jiaxing occupied area are as high as over sixty yuan. Recently, rice shops along the Pudong River have been forced to close down imperceptibly. The reason is that each rice shop in Pudong purchases rice from various Yu counties. When passing through the Huangpu River, they must compulsorily purchase half of it at a price of thirty-seven yuan per picul to be used as military rice. Rice merchants have suffered heavy losses as a result, and are unable to bear the burden. Their appeals have fallen on deaf ears, so although they remain open, they have no rice to sell. In addition, the Su-Xi-Chang area was originally a rice-producing region, but now prices are limited, and rice is purchased on a large scale, in batches of tens of thousands of piculs. During the period of the search, others are not allowed to purchase. As a result, the producing areas must also eat expensive rice. Not only is the price expensive, but the source is also exhausted. As a result, all rice for consumption in various places relies on foreign rice. In the current situation, there is no fear of interruption of foreign rice in Shanghai. However, rice merchants take advantage of the opportunity to treat this as a rare commodity. Furthermore, speculative profiteers agitate the people, often claiming that the weather has been dry for a long time and will affect the future rice harvest, creating opportunities for manipulation. They do not know that the season has just entered the mold. Yesterday, there was drizzling rain, a typical sign of the mold season. The end of the mold is on July 15th. There is a month of effort. Whether the amount of rainfall is large or small is still uncertain, so the recent complaints about the clear weather are not enough to be seen as hindering rice planting. There is no need to worry about a bad harvest. Shanghai has plenty of rice in storage, but rice prices continue to rise. This is an undeniable case of artificial manipulation and hoarding.

For many years, this newspaper has always believed that the treatment of the people's food supply should take into account the principles of both agriculture, commerce and the people's food supply, in order to seek appropriate handling. It is hoped that through continuous mutual benefit, a permanent mutual assistance can be formed. If one is concerned about one thing and loses sight of the others, then even if the temporary benefit is widespread, it cannot be sustained. As for the current handling of the people's food supply, it is limited by the environment and naturally unable to realize ideal adjustments. One can only abandon the fundamental and pursue the superficial. First, seek the stability of the market. Market stability may not be able to completely stabilize prices, but at least it can prevent instability caused by artificial manipulation. This is one. Food control is difficult in the current concession situation, but it cannot be allowed to be difficult and abandoned, putting the people's food problem out of mind. We should consider the difficulties faced by the public in obtaining food within the scope of our possible responsibilities and powers, and separately find ways to solve them appropriately. This is two. Merchants seek profit as their aim. They will move if there is profit, and retreat if there is no profit. Speaking of profiting and hoarding, disregarding the people's livelihood, the facts are all the same. It is not only the rice merchants who are unforgivable. Moreover, merchants transport goods. High prices can attract goods from afar. If those who transport goods are not given benefits, they will stop moving forward, which will cause concern for the people's food supply. Therefore, the legitimate interests of merchants should be protected, but excessive exploitation must be stopped to maintain the people's livelihood. This is three. Therefore, what can be done for the people's food supply today still lies in what this newspaper has always advocated, that is, centralized buying and selling, open evaluation, the abolition of price limits that exist in name only, and thoroughly handling the registration of food. In particular, we must be realistic and not just make statements that end up being empty words. Within the limit, allow free operation. Those who violate the prohibitions and hoard goods privately should be severely punished without leniency. It is necessary to ensure that there is no market outside the market, and to seek uniformity within the market. Buying and selling should be based on actual sales, with cash as the basis. If futures trading cannot be avoided, it should be limited to actual orders from foreign firms. Recently, the so-called "speculative hoarding" and "passing the buck" in the rice market are all evils of the rice market and must be strictly prohibited. In short, the market should return to normal and not be manipulated by speculation. However, this is only the preliminary method for stabilizing food prices and is not enough to discuss fundamental solutions. It is said that for the people's food supply to work well, first, the authorities must make up their minds and be determined. This is called policy. Second, a practical plan must be formulated and a sound organization constructed. This is called technique. Third, it must be entrusted to loyal and capable talents, because having a system of governance without the people to govern is simply to see that laws cannot operate on their own. Once these three are roughly prepared, then we can talk about further measures.

U.S. Ambassador Remains in Paris to Assist with the Transfer of City Affairs

Washington - The U.S. State Department issued the full text of a telegram from U.S. Ambassador to France, Bullitt, which was forwarded to Berlin at the request of the French authorities. The telegram notified the German army that Paris was an undefended city and that troops were withdrawing. Bullitt will remain in Paris to provide any possible assistance to ensure that the city government can function without loss of life. (Reuters, 14th)

Paris - The Paris Police Commissioner, Langeron, recently issued a notice to residents stating that the police authorities would continue to ensure their safety as before, and that they were confident that the personnel of all public utilities would also continue to perform their duties, "until the very last moment." (Havas, 13th) According to diplomatic sources in Geneva, the Governor of Paris, Herrin, after meeting with the city council, decided to declare Paris an undefended city, leaving only a small number of police to maintain order. This decision was made in view of the public's demand for surrender and the overwhelming public sentiment, which was difficult to resist. Therefore, despite Prime Minister Reynaud's opposition, Paris was declared an undefended city to avoid a German military attack on Paris. (Haitong, 14th)

Berlin - Regarding the French radio station's claim that Paris is an undefended city, Berlin officials have not yet commented. It is not yet known whether the French authorities have formally notified the German command. Berlin welcomes Paris to follow the example of Brussels and avoid repeating the tragedy of Warsaw, so as not to turn the capital into a battlefield. (Haitong, 14th)

Paris Armaments Factories Move to Southern Regions

Paris - The armaments factories in the Paris city area have already moved to the "more concealed" southern regions in accordance with the cabinet's orders. All kinds of large and small freight trucks, loaded with machinery, tools, and parts for airplanes and cannons, are departing from Paris day and night. The destination is not officially announced. It is reported that these armaments will be moved to a new "Maginot Line" to continue working, where they cannot be attacked by enemy planes. Observers say that once the various machines and tools are assembled, the factories can resume work, so that arms manufacturing will not be delayed. (Havas, 12th)

Britain Reaffirms Solidarity with France and Will Fight On

London - Just after 7:00 AM today, telephone communication between here and Paris was not completely cut off, but there was an "indefinite delay." Those who had scheduled calls were generally not being accepted. (Reuters, 14th)

London - The British government has sent a telegram to the French government stating that, in this critical time, for the sake of the freedom and democracy that both countries uphold, the British government wishes to express its admiration for the courage, endurance, and perseverance shown by the French army in its battle against overwhelming odds. Their efforts are worthy of France's most glorious traditions and have inflicted deep and lasting wounds on the enemy's strength. Britain is willing to continue to provide the greatest possible assistance. We now take this opportunity to declare the inseparable unity of the two nations and the two empires. We cannot measure the various hardships that will befall our peoples and nations in the near future, but we are determined that this fiery crucible will forge the two nations into an invincible entity. We now reaffirm our pledge to the French Republic and resolve to spare no sacrifice, to continue the fight in France, on the island, on the sea, and in the sky, wherever it may lead us, using all our resources to the utmost, and to jointly bear the burden of repairing the scars of war. We will never retreat from the war until France is able to stand tall in all its majesty, until the countries and nations that have been insulted and enslaved are liberated, and until civilization has escaped the scourge of Nazism. On this day of dawning light, we are even more assured that the dawn will come sooner than we have a right to hope for. (Reuters, 14th)

London - Officials announced that British troops recently sent to France have been engaged in combat with the enemy south of the Seine. (Havas, 13th)

### German War Bulletin

Berlin - German military experts yesterday issued a supplementary war bulletin report to Haitong Foxconn, stating that after eight days of fierce fighting in northern France, the German army has crossed the Marne River, crossed the battlefields of the World War, and pursued the defeated and retreating enemy troops, capturing countless military equipment and prisoners. (Haitong, 14th)

Berlin - The fighting on the Rhine River upstream near the Swiss border has become intense. The fighting was initiated by French artillery fire, which was met with a fierce German artillery response. (Haitong, 14th)

Berlin - Military leaders here said that Allied Commander-in-Chief General Weygand would be unable to continue maintaining the front line and making an orderly retreat from Paris, as the rapid German advance had encircled the city. They said that General Weygand's current predicament was different from that of the Republican army during the Spanish Civil War and that he was unable to make a safe retreat like the Spanish Republican army. It is reported that Führer Hitler has moved his headquarters closer to Paris in the past few days, but news of the Führer's whereabouts was not available here last night. According to German officials last night, 100,000 Allied soldiers have been captured since June 5th, and Allied equipment, especially tanks, has been destroyed or seized. The number far exceeds the Allied production. Although the German army's air force was hindered by the bad weather, many strongholds that had crossed the Marne River had been taken. After some resistance, the Allied forces hastily retreated from several strongholds. According to German sources, the war spoils captured by the German army cannot be counted at present. When 26,000 British and French troops surrendered at Saint-Valery, a large amount of military equipment was seized. Because of the cliffs along the English Channel, the Allied forces were unable to escape the German encirclement by boarding ships there. The German air force bombed the Allied transport ships, and military sources said that the ships were transporting troops at other strongholds along the coast. (United Press, 14th)

Hitler's Headquarters - This afternoon's German war bulletin stated that the entire French defense line between the English Channel and the Maginot Line has collapsed. The French attempt to defend Paris has been shattered. The German army has now won and entered Paris. (Haitong, 14th) Berlin - The second phase of the great Western War has ended victoriously for the German army. The resistance of the French Northern Army has been defeated. The German army has crossed the Seine, and Le Havre has been occupied. The French army from Paris to the Maginot Line near Sedan is retreating as a whole. German tanks and mechanized troops have charged through the defeated enemy troops and are moving beyond them. The enemy has abandoned a large amount of military equipment. The enemy troops defending Paris are no longer capable. German troops have entered Paris this morning. Last night, the German army attacked Dead Man's Hill northeast of Verdun and reoccupied Montmédy, which is also an important pillar of the Maginot Line. The German army has now begun the third phase of the war, which aims to clear out the remaining enemy troops to complete the final victory. This morning, the German army began a frontal attack on the Maginot Line along the Saar border. German fighter planes and low-flying bombers bombed enemy concentrations, railway stations, railways, and airfields all day long, causing heavy damage. German aircraft sank two French transport ships near Le Havre and damaged three others, one of which was 10,000 tons. North of Le Havre, German anti-aircraft guns sank an enemy military transport ship and damaged three others. Under pressure from German artillery fire, a British destroyer, which was sailing away, turned back. According to statistics, the Allies lost 19 planes yesterday, three of which were shot down in air combat and three by anti-aircraft fire. The rest were destroyed on the ground. Two German planes are missing. Yesterday, a German submarine sank a supporting cruiser (17,000 tons), and another submarine sank a 11,000-ton transport ship. (Haitong, 14th)

Berlin - Hitler met with American journalist Wiegand at the Western Front headquarters today and said that he had never intended to destroy the British Empire. On the contrary, before the outbreak of the war, he had proposed to the British government to provide assistance to maintain the position of the British Empire, but it was not accepted. Of course, the outcome of this war will inevitably lead to the destruction of some things. The capitalist group's pursuit of its own interests will destroy millions of lives, but I think this result will be created by its own people and not promoted by us. (Haitong, 14th)

### Japanese Offensive in Western Hubei Fails - Dangyang County Recaptured - Main Force of Japanese Troops Surrounded West of Yaque Ridge - Chinese Forces Hold Absolute Advantage on the Hanyi Road

Yichang - After recapturing Yuan'an, the brave Chinese troops continued to press south. At the same time, the large Chinese army advancing south from northern Hubei also crossed the Zhexi River, closely following the Japanese in Dangyang, and launched a fierce attack on the Japanese flank. They surrounded the main force of the Japanese army in the area west of Yaque Ridge. This time, the Japanese army rashly invaded westward and suffered heavy blows from the Chinese army. Over 6,000 Japanese troops have been annihilated in recent days. The Japanese troops trailing the Chinese forces are in great pain and unable to resist. Most of the Japanese are now retreating along the river. The Chinese army took advantage of the victory to recapture Dangyang County. At 2:00 PM, heavy rain began along the entire line, and Japanese aircraft lost their ability to operate, which greatly demoralized the Japanese. The Chinese army on the Hanyi Road now holds an absolute advantage. It will not be difficult to completely annihilate the Japanese troops on the west bank of the Xiang River. (Reported on the 14th)

Yichang - The Chinese army has taken the advantage in the fighting on the Hanyi Road. Yesterday, a large detachment of Japanese troops from Dangyang invaded westward and engaged in fierce fighting with the Chinese army in the Yaque Ridge area. After five hours of bloody battle, the Japanese gradually showed signs of collapse. The Chinese army intensified the pressure, and the Japanese retreated in defeat at noon on the 13th. As soon as the Chinese army arrived, they launched a fierce attack on the Japanese occupying Yuan'an, besieging them all day. The Japanese fled eastward. Yuan'an has now been recaptured by the Chinese army. (Reported on the 13th)

Hong Kong - According to Chinese sources here, a portion of the Japanese army that crossed the Han River to advance on Yichang has been counterattacked by the Chinese army in the Daba Mountains and suffered heavy losses.

Hong Kong - According to foreign sources here, fierce fighting occurred in the northeastern suburbs of Yichang yesterday and the day before. Japanese aircraft, in formations of three to five, continuously bombed the area in shifts. Large fires broke out in several places. Residents in the suburbs of the city had already evacuated to safe areas. As of late last night, the Chinese army was still fighting fiercely. The Japanese brigade of over 10,000 men that attacked the outskirts of Yichang has had its retreat cut off by the Chinese army. They are carrying very few military supplies, and their position is trapped in a Chinese encirclement. The battle situation is expected to develop anew within days. At the same time, the main force of the Japanese army on the Hanyi Highway has encountered strong resistance from the Chinese army and the thorough destruction of transportation, making it very difficult for the Japanese to march forward, so there has been little progress. (Express News Agency, 14th)

### Gospel for Poor Children in Chengdu: Completion of the Construction of the Child Welfare and Treatment Center

Chengdu - French doctor Bessan has been in Sichuan for eleven years and has a natural sympathy for China. Especially, he has friendship with all circles in Sichuan. Last year, he initiated the establishment of a Sino-French friendship-run child welfare and treatment center. The funds were raised by Bessan in France. He provides free medical care to poor children. It has been largely completed and is scheduled to open next month. The center is located in the northern suburbs of Chengdu. The nine buildings have been completed and can accommodate 120 beds. There is also an isolation ward. Dozens of sick children have been admitted for treatment. Poor adults in the vicinity can also seek outpatient medical treatment. This precious sympathy is deeply regrettable. (Reported on the 14th)

### Japanese Aircraft Tragically Bomb Chinese Civilians - U.S. Government Strongly Condemns - U.S. Property in Chongqing Suffers Losses - Ambassador Grew Lodges Protest with Japan

Washington - U.S. Secretary of State Hull issued a statement yesterday, "denouncing" the tragic bombing of Chinese civilians by Japanese aircraft. In response to questions about the Japanese bombing of Chongqing, Hull stated that according to official and unofficial information received by the State Department, Chongqing has been indiscriminately bombed by Japanese aircraft in the past few days. Yesterday, the city was again indiscriminately bombed by over 100 Japanese aircraft. Hundreds of Chinese civilians were killed and injured. Several American homes, including churches and schools, were destroyed by the explosions. Two formations of Japanese aircraft flew over the American Embassy, but did not drop bombs in the vicinity. Hull continued, the attitude and position of the American people and government regarding the indiscriminate bombing of civilians by Japanese aircraft have been repeatedly and clearly announced. We will denounce the indiscriminate bombing of civilians by Japanese aircraft anytime and anywhere. (United Press, 14th)

Tokyo - The U.S. government recently protested to the Japanese Foreign Ministry regarding the frequent bombing of Chongqing by Japanese aircraft, which has put part of American property in the city in a precarious situation, and part of it has even been destroyed. The protest was personally delivered to Japanese Foreign Minister Arita by U.S. Ambassador to Japan Grew. Ambassador Grew also informed the Japanese Foreign Minister of the remarks made to the American press by U.S. Secretary of State Hull yesterday, which strongly condemned the indiscriminate bombing of Chinese civilians by Japanese aircraft. (United Press, 14th)

Washington - The U.S. State Department made it clear yesterday that if Japan wants to improve its relations with the United States, its bombing of Chongqing is a misstep. U.S. Secretary of State Hull, when speaking to reporters yesterday about the U.S.'s long-held stance of condemning and opposing air strikes on civilians, spoke solemnly and with emotion. He also expressed the same sentiments when discussing the repeated air raids on Chongqing, emphasizing the indiscriminate and cruel nature of each air raid. Hull said that if anyone asked whether the United States intended to implement an embargo on machine tools and scrap iron to express its disgust, he did not want to say anything further at this time. He still believed that the embargo provisions in the May proposal did not conflict with the policy of mutual trade agreements, because the embargo provisions were to protect military-related national defense supplies. His previous remarks on this topic had paved the way for possible action when the proposal became law.

A diplomatic affairs writer for Scripps and Howard newspapers strongly opposed any "deal" between the United States and Japan yesterday. If Japan's wishes were accommodated, the Japanese would no longer pay attention to promises in new treaties, as was the case with Japan's entry into "Manchukuo" and its disregard for treaty obligations by fortifying the mandated islands. This "deal" would be a fatal blow to the United States, just as the Munich Agreement was to the Allied powers, because it would be tantamount to implying that the third major democracy was intimidated. (Reuters, 14th)

### U.S. Far East Policy Still Too Weak - Japan's Ambitions Unsatisfied - Allowing a Malignancy to Grow Will Cause Trouble

Salottesville - Walter Feele, Secretary of the American College of the Pacific International Relations Society, delivered a speech today, criticizing the weakness of U.S. Far East policy and warning in strong terms that Japan will take advantage of the difficulties in Europe to expand its influence in Southeast Asia. Mr. Feele said that while the U.S. is aiding China in the Sino-Japanese War, why is it also aiding Japan? This U.S. Far East policy is truly baffling. Today, the prolonging of the Sino-Japanese War is undoubtedly due to the U.S. Without the supply of U.S. military supplies, how could Japan engage in such large-scale aggression? If China did not have U.S. moral support and financial loans, whether China could continue its war would also be a question. Feele continued that U.S. public opinion is now demanding that the U.S. government adopt strong measures in the Far East. It must be understood that the exposure of weakness by Britain, France, the U.S., and the Soviet Union in the Far East will allow Japan to do as it pleases and expand the area of war. If the U.S. allows Germany's Far East opponent to control East Asia and the resource-rich colonies, will the position of the Western Hemisphere be even more dangerous? "Japan will take this opportunity to further expand its aggression in China and spread the war to the colonies of Southeast Asia. Japan dares to do whatever it wants only because of the weakness of Britain, the U.S., France, and the Soviet Union. If there were a strong enemy in front of it, Japan would never dare to act recklessly." (United Press, 14th)

### Japan Intends to Invade the Dutch East Indies - Nomura's Visit to Southeast Asia Draws Attention

Manila - Southeast Asia, which has become one of the world's raw material storehouses, is paying close attention to the attitude of the United States, because people in the area believe that if the U.S. joins the European War, it will have a significant impact on the Far East. People in the Dutch East Indies now hope that the U.S. fleet will be stationed in Hawaii to maintain the status quo of the Dutch East Indies. Many Dutch observers believe that once the U.S. enters the war, the U.S. fleet will inevitably be transferred to the Atlantic, which will allow Japan, the world's third-largest naval power, to dominate the Pacific. Dutch political observers pointed out that although Japanese personnel are greatly weakened by three years of war in China, the Japanese Navy has not participated in the Chinese war and remains intact. If the Japanese Navy believes there is an opportunity to take advantage, it will inevitably engage in military action in the Dutch East Indies in the hope of compensating for the losses of three years of war in China. Currently, general attention is being paid to the news spread by the Japanese side that British troops are landing in the Dutch East Indies and that Foreign Minister Nomura will visit the Dutch East Indies and the Philippines. Authorities in Manila do not believe that Japan can provoke the U.S. at this time, but they believe that Japan will adopt various peaceful means to expand trade in Southeast Asia. As for the Philippine officials, they remain silent on the Japanese reports that Foreign Minister Nomura will come to the former Philippines to discuss immigration laws. It is recalled that the Japanese side believed that the new immigration law, which limited the number of Japanese immigrants from 12,000 per year to 500 per year, was discriminatory against the Japanese.

### Japanese Ship Shot - Japan Prepare to Protest to the Netherlands

Tokyo - Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman Suma recently confirmed reports that a Dutch ship shot a Japanese fishing boat in Dutch East Indies waters and said that the Japanese government would protest to the Dutch government. Suma also said that it was not yet known whether the location of the incident was definitely in Dutch territorial waters. Regarding the news spread by Tokyo newspapers yesterday that Foreign Minister Nomura would visit the Dutch East Indies, Suma replied to reporters' inquiries that Nomura's visit to the Dutch East Indies and the Philippines was a private action and had nothing to do with the Japanese government (United Press, 16th)

### Japan's Invasion of China Depletes Financial Resources - Reserves Less Than 100 Million Yuan

Washington - Washington officials estimate that Japan's gold reserves have been reduced to less than 110 million yuan, but they are greatly puzzled by the fact that Japan continues to use gold to pay for goods. Although the Bank of Japan continues to list its reserve amount as 1,640,000,000 yuan (this amount has been listed in Japanese books since December 1938 and has never changed), officials here estimate that Japan's gold is less than 110 million yuan. In 1939, Japan paid the U.S. a total of 200 million yuan for goods, mostly in gold. Japan imported a total of 166,000,000 yuan worth of gold to the U.S. in 1939, and another 55 million yuan worth of gold in the first three months of 1940. U.S. officials, who had expected Japan's gold supply to be rapidly depleted, were baffled by the amount of gold that Japan continued to import to the U.S. One explanation is that Japan had secretly stored a large amount of gold long ago in preparation for a possible war with the Soviet Union, and is now using this reserve to pay for its war against China. It is estimated here that Japan produces no more than 62 million yuan worth of gold each year, and the ability of its foreign trade to obtain foreign exchange has also shown signs of decline.

### U.S. President Responds to Reynaud - Provides Extensive Aid to the Allied Forces - Congress Expedites Legislative Procedures - to Supply Surplus Military Supplies to Britain and France

Washington - In response to French Premier Reynaud's appeal for aid, President Roosevelt reiterated the U.S.'s promise of full assistance to the Allied forces in a message to the French Premier last night, saying that the U.S. would provide the Allied forces with material resources to the best of its ability. The White House announced last night that the original text of the French Premier's appeal to President Roosevelt had not yet been received, but the U.S. was already doing its best to transport military supplies to France. The White House also said that there would be no comment here on the French Premier's letter to President Roosevelt, as it was of a personal nature. Before French Premier Reynaud's appeal was released, President Roosevelt had already promised to provide extensive aid to the Allied forces. Although President Roosevelt's speech in Salottesville was pre-planned, it completely answered Reynaud's appeal. According to news from Paris, while President Roosevelt was responding to Reynaud, Premier Reynaud was also broadcasting to the U.S., repeating his appeal to Washington. (United Press, 14th)

Washington - As President Roosevelt responded to French Premier Reynaud's urgent appeal, promising to do his best to aid the Allied forces, the U.S. Congress also accelerated its legislative procedures to help the Allied forces defeat the German army in France. As a result of a joint meeting of the Senate and House of Representatives yesterday, they unanimously agreed to pass a bill authorizing the President to sell surplus military supplies to the Allied forces. The bill also removes the restrictions on the number of army aircraft that the President can supply to the Allied forces, and authorizes the President to exercise a blockade of military supplies and machinery to distinguish it from the prohibition of the export of munitions and machinery to Japan. (United Press, 14th)

### French Premier Appeals Again to America, Hoping the US Will Seize the Opportunity to Provide Effective Assistance

From a Certain Place in France: Premier Reynaud delivered a radio address last night, announcing that he had sent a second appeal to US President Roosevelt. A translation of his address is as follows:

"At this critical juncture, I wish to first inform the world of the bravery of our nation's troops and the valor of our soldiers and their officers. I have personally witnessed soldiers returning from the front lines of Qian [likely a typo, intended as 'front'] fighting as they retreated, constantly harassed by enemy aircraft, having not slept for five days. The enemy believes they can break the spirit of these men, but they still hold steadfast confidence in the ultimate outcome of the war, and have not the slightest doubt about the future of the nation. The heroic deeds of our army in the battle of Dunkirk earlier this month have already been praised by the world. However, the valor displayed in the recent battles from the coast to the Argonne area surpasses even that. This shows that the soul of France has not been conquered and that our nation will never yield under foreign aggression. For thousands of years, we have repelled or conquered aggressors countless times on the land where we live. Moreover, our country has made great contributions to humanity in the past, so everyone should know that they owe a great debt to France, and the time to repay that debt has come. The French army is now the vanguard of all democratic nations' armies. The French army is sacrificing itself. Even if we are defeated now, it will be enough to inflict a major blow on the common enemy of all nations. For example, countless enemy tanks have been destroyed, countless enemy aircraft have been shot down, their personnel losses have been heavy, and many of their gasoline tanks have been hit and set on fire. All of this is enough to affect the morale of the German people. Therefore, at this moment, a wounded France has the right to ask something of other democratic nations, and I firmly believe that no one with a sense of justice can refuse. However, agreeing is one thing, and taking action is another. The great American nation has always valued ideals, and we know this well. In this situation, should our great American friend hesitate any longer in declaring opposition to Nazi Germany? I asked President Roosevelt about this yesterday, and I now wish to make a second appeal, which is also the last appeal. In the past, every time I asked President Roosevelt to step up aid to us within the limits permitted by American law, the President has always been generous in doing so, and the American people have always approved of it. I am deeply grateful for your kindness and friendship. But the problem is no longer so simple at this moment. Today is a matter of the survival of France. If the current war becomes increasingly difficult, there is no point in carrying on unless the hope of mutual benefit becomes increasingly strong. For example, the quality of the British Air Force is excellent, which has already been proven by facts, but if we want to crush the evil forces that are oppressing Europe, we need a constant supply of military aircraft from across the Atlantic. In short, although the front lines of the democratic nations have suffered setbacks, they still possess infinite power. Therefore, we hope that the time for the democratic nations to use all their power to engage in a full-scale battle is approaching. This is why our hearts are full of hope. This is why we have decided that France must maintain a free government, and therefore must abandon Paris. Because Hitler's intention is to eliminate our legitimate government, so as to proclaim to the world that France no longer exists, and then organize a puppet government, just as he has done in other countries. In order to prevent this conspiracy, we must withdraw from Paris. According to historical records, our nation has never been moved by the words of defeatists when it has suffered major setbacks. This is the greatness of our nation. No matter what happens in the future, the French nation is determined to endure hardship and persevere to the end. In other words, we will never fail the glorious history of France. We must love each other like brothers and sisters, and fight with all our strength for the revival of our wounded motherland," (Havas News Agency, 14th).

### Two Coincidental Events

Washington: Today, the White House announced that President Roosevelt's recent speech in Charlottesville was generally regarded as a response to French Premier Reynaud's appeal for American assistance. In fact, the French Premier's telegram was only presented after Roosevelt returned from Charlottesville, so the fact that his speech was aimed at the French Premier was merely a coincidence. According to reports, President Roosevelt delivered a speech at the University of Virginia on June 10, saying that the United States should provide material resources to those who resist force. (Reuters, 13th)

### Struggle Between Old and New Systems

Stockholm, Sweden: The "Aftonbladet" newspaper reported that President Roosevelt has had a strong reaction to Italy, and the issue is no longer about American neutrality. What we are witnessing now is a struggle between two systems, the old and the new, in the world. Behind President Roosevelt's words lies the actual value of American material resources. Moreover, President Roosevelt has realized that the United States may, in the near future, abandon its non-belligerent status. The serious defeat of France or the attack on Britain will determine whether the United States will intervene. (Reuters, 14th)

### Sending Troops Unlikely

Washington: It is reported that Reynaud's appeal telegram will arrive tonight, and its content is expected to be a request for military assistance. However, President Roosevelt declared that "the United States has done all it can." Observers here believe that, judging from the tone of Reynaud's telegram, if the United States does not urgently send a large number of warplanes to help, France may succumb soon. Official opinion is that if the Allies do not disintegrate, even if France and Britain are conquered, a "no surrender" policy will make the entire Eastern Hemisphere a battlefield. However, there are no signs that President Roosevelt will send an expeditionary force, as he has repeatedly stated that the government does not want to send troops to Europe. (International News Service, 14th)

### Evacuation of Residents in Northern France: Refuge Like a Tide, Orderly Along the Way

London: A Reuters correspondent accompanying the British Air Force in France described in detail the large-scale evacuation of residents from Paris and other places in northern France, saying, "I drove through the crowd for over fifty miles and witnessed refugees fleeing like a tide. The patience of these refugees is admirable. I personally saw many people lining up in front of a gas station waiting to buy gas, with no one pushing or shoving. Although the gas was about to run out, everyone got a little. Damaged vehicles were also being repaired by someone. All the hotels had 'Full' signs hanging up, and those who arrived later had to leave with a look of disappointment, without complaining or demanding a place. The same was true for restaurants and shops. Those who arrived late and could not get food or goods also did not complain. Although the refugees all looked tired, there were few tears. Children sitting among the luggage showed smiles, as if indicating that they did not feel pain from the long journey. The elderly fell asleep due to exhaustion, and their wrinkled and resolute faces seemed to maintain their determination even in their sleep. Most of the vehicles driven by the refugees carried two things: a leather rug, to be used as a makeshift bed when there was nowhere to stay, and a bicycle, to be used as a temporary means of transportation in case the car broke down or the horses were overworked." (Reuters, 14th)

### Evacuation of Children Begins in England

Stockholm, Sweden: According to news received here, about 120,000 children in London began to be evacuated yesterday morning, and it seems that it will take five days to complete the evacuation. It is said that about 30 trains a day will transport children from London to places such as Leicester, Somerset, Devon, and Cornwall. According to recent statistics, the total number of children in London is 300,000, and officials are well aware that even after the implementation of the current large-scale evacuation plan, it will still be difficult to evacuate all the children. (Haitong News Agency, 14th)

London: The authorities have stipulated that if paratroopers or other troops parachute from the air, volunteers or local defense volunteers must go to the church to ring the bell to warn the public. In addition, all churches are prohibited from ringing the bells. (Reuters, 14th)

### US Ambassador to Britain Meets with British Foreign Secretary to Discuss the Need for Assistance to the Allies

London: US Ambassador to Britain, Kennedy, met with British Foreign Secretary Halifax yesterday. It is believed that both sides discussed the issue of further American assistance to the Allies. It is generally believed that the German occupation of Paris is only a matter of time, and the situation of France is therefore in danger. Britain's request for military materials from the United States to curb the German threat is even more urgent. It is believed that if the United States can transport military supplies to the Allies as soon as possible, the Allies will not only be able to stop the German advance, but also repel the German army. (United Press International, 14th)

### Japan's Treaty of Friendship with Thailand and Britain's Non-Aggression Pact with Thailand are Said to be Completely Different in Nature

Tokyo: Regarding the official news from Bangkok that Thailand (formerly Siam) has concluded a non-aggression pact with Britain and France, a British interviewer recently asked a spokesperson for the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs whether Japan opposes the British non-aggression pact with Thailand. The spokesperson replied, "No, Japan's treaty of friendship with Thailand has nothing to do with the British and French non-aggression pacts with Thailand and their negotiations. The Japanese-Thai treaty is completely different from the British and French non-aggression pacts with Thailand. The Japanese-Thai treaty aims to maintain and promote the peaceful and friendly relationship that already exists between the two countries, while non-aggression pacts, as initiated by the Soviet Union in 1926, are concluded because one party fears aggression from the other."

### British King's Special Envoy Arrives in US by Plane Carrying Important Documents

New York: Robinson, the special envoy sent by the British King, arrived here today. He traveled from Europe on the Pan American Clipper, carrying a small box of important documents, chained to his arm, never leaving his side, and could not remove the lead box until he arrived at the British Embassy in Washington and handed over the documents. It is said that the reason for placing the documents in the lead box is that it is heavy, and in case of an accident during the crossing of the ocean, the box will sink to the bottom of the sea and will not drift into the hands of others.

### Turkey Takes Precautions, Actively Strengthens Defense, New German-Turkish Trade Agreement Established

Ankara: It is believed that Turkey's position, due to the situation created by Italy's participation in the war, will soon be clarified. It is likely that Turkish Prime Minister Saydam will issue a formal statement today. Yesterday, the authorities considered all the disputes involved in any steps Turkey might take. The cabinet held two meetings, and the People's Party seemed to be continuing to hold plenary sessions. The British and French ambassadors resumed talks with the Turkish authorities yesterday, while the Italian and German diplomats stationed here were also very active. At the same time, under recent orders, the reserves who should enlist are now leaving their fields and joining the army. Horses and vehicles have been requisitioned where necessary. This activity does not mean that Turkey will immediately declare war, but it is a sign that the Turkish government attaches great importance to its national defense and obligations. (Reuters, 14th)

Ankara: According to news received here, the trade agreement signed yesterday between Germany and Turkey has been exchanged and approved. According to the agreement, the value of goods exchanged between the two parties each year will reach 21,000,000.

Berlin: Berlin is very pleased with Spain's declaration as a non-belligerent country and Turkey's decision to adopt a neutral policy. Germany believes that Spain's change from neutrality to non-belligerency is a sign of solidarity between Germany, Italy, and Spain, and that Turkey's continued neutrality and the conclusion of the German-Turkish trade treaty are regarded by political figures here as a sign that Turkey is truly following Kemal's legacy. (Haitong News Agency, 18th)

Istanbul: According to the "Tan Newspaper," the mutual assistance treaty between Britain, France, and Turkey stipulates that military assistance will be given to Turkey in the event of an Italian attack on the Eastern Mediterranean, but Italy has no intention of expanding the war to the Eastern Mediterranean. Although future developments are unknowable, it is expected that Italy will limit its military actions as much as possible. (Haitong News Agency, 14th)

### If Undefended Cities in Egypt are Bombed, They Will Immediately Declare War on Italy

Cairo: Egypt's current policy towards Italy is purely defensive. However, according to sources here, Egypt fully respects the British-Egyptian Treaty, and should therefore be governed by Britain itself, and cooperate with Britain in guaranteeing security, limited to providing naval, land, and air force bases. These bases should of course be regarded as military targets and will be attacked by the Italian side. However, if Italy attacks other territories of Egypt, or bombs purely Egyptian airfields, ports, towns, or civilians and soldiers, Egypt will be forced to declare war. (Reuters, 14th)

### Ireland Declares Strict Neutrality

Nice, France: An Italian wireless station recently issued a message saying that the Irish Republic's envoy to Italy had notified Italian Foreign Minister Ciano that the government of the Republic would continue to maintain strict neutrality towards Italy. (Havas News Agency, 13th)

### Results of the Norwegian Campaign: Hitler Issues Proclamation Praising Meritorious Generals

Hitler's Headquarters: Hitler today issued a letter to the German army, navy, and air force soldiers who conquered Norway, saying, "Soldiers, the Norwegian war is now over. The attempt by Britain to plunder territory vital to Germany's survival has now been shattered by our soldiers who conquered Norway. Your loyalty and bravery for the country should be inspired by the whole country and the people. General Falkenhorst's command of the land battle, Admiral Saalwachter's, Admiral Carls', and Rear Admiral Lütjens' command of the naval battle, Admiral Boehm's responsibility for coastal defense construction, General Milch's and Lieutenant General Nasse's command of the air battle, their effective operations and victory over the enemy, should be especially commended. The loyalty and bravery of the soldiers of the army, navy, and air force for the country, and their courage to sacrifice, should be especially commended. The Battle of Narvik will be admired by the people of the whole country. Lieutenant General Dietl's battle achievements have added to Germany's glorious history, and I am most inspired by them."

### A "Neutral" Voice at the Beginning of the European War (6)

— Uncle Di

Prophecy is naturally a very dangerous thing; however, according to the majority opinion of insightful observers at present, even so, it is still impossible. The simplest way to understand is to take a quick glance at the current map of Europe. The annihilation of Poland is probably only a matter of time. At that time, the geographical situation is: Italy and Sweden are allies, and she can also jointly expand her power in the Balkans with the Soviet Union and Germany; conversely, if she separates from Germany and joins the British and French sides, she will be immediately expelled from the Balkans and held by Germany and the Soviet Union. Now, the example of Italy's defection in the last war is constantly appearing in the minds of the British and French rulers, hoping that it can be repeated. However, we must know that Russia stood on the side of the Allied Powers during the last European War. Before the outbreak of the war, the best way for Britain and France to dismantle the German-Italian axis was to ally with the Soviet Union. Now, this has of course become the past. Under the current situation of the Soviet Union's benevolent neutrality towards Germany, it is impossible to separate Italy. In fact, talking about dismantling the German-Italian bloc at this time is really a matter of propaganda with no content. We all know that since the Munich Conference last year, the war preparations of Germany and Italy have long been placed on the same basis, and are being organized and distributed in practice. With the families of two highly industrialized and highly centralized dictators, in fact, they have long become a combat unit, which is absolutely difficult to easily dismantle! If I were to describe it in detail, I am afraid it would take up too much space here; here, I can only cite two of the most obvious examples to give you a glimpse. First, we know that since September 1938, Germany has constantly mobilized more than one million people, and coupled with political indiscriminate arrests and racial anti-Semitism, all kinds of things have created a serious side effect: a shortage of labor. For a country actively preparing for war, this is a very serious panic. So, how to remedy it? An unprecedented thing appeared; Italy supplied a large number of laborers—including workers and farmers—who were transported to Germany by the carload. This is not a simple individual action by workers and farmers, but part of the national policy of Germany and Italy. There is another thing that is also absolutely impossible between countries under other circumstances; that is, Germany massively supplied Italy with junior army officers to reorganize the Italian army. Therefore, it also caused resentment and protests from the Italian army against Mussolini, the seriousness of which can be imagined.

Putting each other's resources in one place and engaging in the organization and preparation for combat on the same basis, in this regard, the German-Italian bloc is earlier than the British-French bloc.

Then, the final question is: Why doesn't Italy join Germany's battle against Britain and France? The answer is still the same as I said before: she has actually participated, but the way is "not to participate." In other words, this is just a part of the overall strategy of the German-Italian bloc. I have mentioned Germany's entire strategy roughly before, so I won't repeat it here. (V) Spain's Opposition to "Expanding the War" (September 19)

In the days before the outbreak of the war, Spain's attitude was a noteworthy and meaningful issue. Its nature is quite subtle; not joining in the celebration? All international conditions and Spain's domestic conditions are denying this. Joining the German-Italian side? If this is the case, then the demobilization work that Franco has been actively carrying out for the past few months will become a bubble, and he will have to mobilize again; but where can he raise this money in the war-torn Spain? Then, take the opportunity to defect and join the British and French sides? This is even more impossible. Just to mention two things, all the fortresses and submarine bases built by Germany and Italy on the northwest and southern coasts of Spain are the shackles that make it difficult for Spain to break away from Germany and Italy; furthermore, the large number of German and Italian military personnel and technicians staying in the southern foothills of the Pyrenees Mountains bordering Spain and France is also a major obstacle to Spain's defection.

Now, the facts have finally answered all our questions. She followed in Italy's footsteps and participated in the battle against Britain and France in the form of "non-participation."

Here, therefore, we get a roughly correct insight: Spain's attitude is more or less dependent on Italy's attitude.

In terms of diplomacy, she has entered a state of suspension with Britain and France during these times. The most active period was the eve of the defeat of the government forces until the beginning of August this year. However, since the failure of the pull-in work under the command of French Foreign Minister Bonnet, and the failure of the friendly work of General Petain, the French ambassador to Spain, who had a teacher-student relationship with Franco, the only one who tried a third experiment was the British industrial delegation. Until the eve of the outbreak of the war, this delegation was still in the process of visiting Spain, and it did not receive any results. Therefore, when Britain and France decided to declare war on Germany before the outbreak of the war, they did not have any illusions about Spain, just like they did about Italy.

In terms of military affairs, what Britain and France are most worried about is the threat of the Spanish coast to Gibraltar, so earlier than any other measures, the first thing the British navy did after mobilization was to declare a blockade of the Strait of Gibraltar. As for the German and Italian submarine bases on the northwest coast of Spain, because Spain is still in a "neutral" position in the law, Britain and France can do nothing about it. The biggest reason for the recent activity of German submarines in the Atlantic is that it has a good base in this area.

Most importantly, of course, is the economic aspect. Since British naval officers announced the blockade of German imports, Germany's trade with South American countries has been completely cut off. Now Germany's remedy is to use the Spanish coast as a transshipment point for trade with South American countries. From here, it is transported to Italy or the Balkan countries. Because Spain and most South American countries are of the same race, Germany can escape the so-called "moral sanctions" of the South American countries under the influence of American propaganda and gain a great advantage in this regard.

Comparing Spain's attitude and position with Italy's, we can immediately discover that her attitude is actually an epitome of Italy's attitude. However, in form, there is also a small difference that is often overlooked by everyone: Italy announced only a temporary non-participation in the battle; Spain, however, clearly announced "neutrality." Because Italy and Germany's alliance was officially announced, in terms of treaty status, if Italy announced "neutrality," it would be equivalent to withdrawing from the alliance. Spain, although in fact it has a military alliance relationship with Germany and Italy, has not announced it, so in terms of treaty status, it can announce its natural "neutrality" when Germany is at war with foreign countries. Of course, these formal differences do not affect the fundamentals of the event. Spain's announcement of "neutrality," like Italy's announcement of "non-participation," can only be understood as a part of Germany and Italy's overall strategy.

### The Significance of the General Graduation Examination System for Schools Above Junior College Lies in Enabling Students to Have a Comprehensive and Systematic Understanding of the Major Subjects They Have Studied

(Chongqing News Agency) In order to improve the level of students and enhance the effectiveness of teaching, the Ministry of Education has issued a general order to all schools above junior college to implement the general graduation examination system starting from the summer vacation of this year. However, the detailed methods have not yet been announced. Our reporter specially visited the person in charge of the ministry to inquire about the details. It is said that most of the schools above junior college after the Anti-Japanese War have continued to offer classes as usual, except for a very small number that have been suspended due to the war. Moreover, many newly added and reorganized schools have also been established. In the future, in addition to schools that are extremely needed by the country and must be established, there seems to be no need to increase the number of schools. Instead, we should focus all our efforts on improving the quality, such as reorganizing the curriculum, adjusting departments, enriching equipment, focusing on academic research, and improving school examinations. The implementation of the general graduation examination system is only one aspect of the various measures. The Sixth Plenary Session of the Central Committee and the National Senate have also made resolutions on higher education, focusing on substance and strictly enforcing schools and various examinations. The general examination system held by the Ministry of Education this time was proposed very early. The First National Education Conference in the 17th year of the Republic of China made a resolution that "when universities handle graduation in the future, they should hold a general examination of students' courses over the years." The Second National Education Conference in the 19th year of the Republic of China and the Conference of Principals of Schools Above Junior College in the 11th year of the Republic of China had similar resolutions. The Third National Education Conference last year also discussed and passed this case. The examination and evaluation meeting convened by the Examination Yuan a few years ago and the recent personnel administration meeting also had resolutions to prepare for the university graduation joint examination. In order to implement the resolutions of the National Education Conference, the Ministry of Education promulgated a clear order this year to implement the general examination system. In addition to the subjects studied by students in the last semester, a general examination of more than three major specialized subjects in the second and third grades must be conducted. It is a mistake to spread the word that the general examination covers all courses over the years. This system is different from the high school graduation examination. The high school graduation examination requires examinations for all major subjects that have been studied. Those who fail one or two subjects must take a makeup examination and pass before they can graduate. The general examination only needs to select three major specialized subjects that have been studied in the second and third grades for examination. Since these subjects have already been studied, and they are the most needed subjects for students to engage in their careers after graduation, they should be reviewed and studied, and should not be forgotten. Otherwise, how can they be applied after graduation? The purpose of the general examination is to enable students to have a comprehensive and systematic understanding of the major specialized subjects they have studied, which is of great importance to students' research and employment. As for the holding of the general examination, it is still handled separately by each school, and does not adopt a unified joint examination format, so there is no difficulty in implementation. Therefore, the implementation of this system, on the one hand, does not increase the academic burden of students this year, and on the other hand, it actually improves the quality of students in the future. Universities in Europe and the United States attach great importance to various examinations, and especially the European countries are the strictest. British universities also have mid-term examinations, which are similar to the preliminary examinations of our medical schools. Our universities have semester examinations in addition to regular examinations, but no academic year examinations. The implementation of the weaving examination system in the future can also make appropriate compensation for this deficiency. The general graduation examination system is just beginning this year. During the implementation period, the methods should be further studied to obtain the greatest effect.

### Jiangsu-Anhui Political College to Enroll Students in Autumn

(Ji'an, 14th) A certain war zone, because the original universities in Jiangsu and Anhui provinces have been relocated inland and young people have no opportunity to further their studies, specially requested and obtained the approval of the Ministry of Education to establish Jiangsu-Anhui Political College. The college site is temporarily located in northern Fujian, with two departments: arts and law. It is scheduled to enroll students in Shanghai and southern Jiangsu, northern Anhui, and southern Anhui in the autumn.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Chinese Children's Middle School Scholarship Examination for Poor Students to Be Held on the 17th of This Month

In order to encourage poor students, the Shanghai Municipal Council has specially set up twelve scholarships for poor students in the four Chinese Children's Middle Schools and Girls' Middle School of the Shanghai Municipal Council, eight for boys and four for girls. In addition to four boys and two girls who are specially selected from graduates of the Shanghai Municipal Council Primary Schools, the remaining four boys and two girls are selected from graduates of other primary schools in the Shanghai Municipal Council. Recently, our reporter from the Great China News Agency learned that as of yesterday, there were 51 applicants from various primary schools of the Shanghai Municipal Council and 119 from private primary schools, with girls accounting for about one-third. Letters have been sent to the principals of each candidate's primary school, and the examination is scheduled to be held at the Shanghai Municipal Council Northern District Primary School at 119 Crenan Road on the 17th of this month (Monday). In addition to lunch being provided by the candidates themselves, they must also gather at the examination hall at 8:45 a.m., bringing their own pens and inkstones, and wait quietly for the examination. Each candidate will also be accompanied by a staff member from their school to take care of them. The chief examiner on that day will be Mr. Chen Xuanshan, Deputy Director of the Chinese Education Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council.

### Ministry of Education Plans to Increase Loan Funds for Students Above Junior College

(Chongqing News Agency) The Ministry of Education has previously increased the meal fee loan for schools above junior college to 10 to 16 yuan per student per month, taking into account the cost of living in various places. Recently, due to soaring prices and particularly high cost of living in some places, students still have difficulty obtaining the necessary nutrition. The Ministry of Education believes that insufficient nutrition for students has a great impact on their health, and recently sent telegrams to various schools above junior college to report on the recent status of student meals, the minimum amount of meal fees required, and the local value of food, in order to plan a reasonable increase in meal fee loans again, so that students in various places can obtain the necessary conditions for nutrition.

### Strengthening Defenses, No Worries About Security, Concession Status More Consolidated, False Propaganda Attacks Ineffective, Merchant Corps Supplementing Vacancies, Strength Sufficient

Since Italy implemented its participation in the war, the situation in Shanghai became somewhat tense due to concerns that the opposition between the British, French, and Italian troops stationed here would cause disputes. However, the firm attitude and actions of the stationed troops of various countries in maintaining the status quo of the concessions have become the most powerful stabilizing factor in Shanghai. The International Merchant Corps has recently replenished its members, increasing its strength, so there is no need to worry about security in the future. Therefore, people's hearts are settled, order is peaceful, and everything has returned to normal. However, the puppet regime has even put forward the demand to withdraw troops, advocating the "recovery" of the concessions. However, the diplomatic authorities of various countries stationed in Shanghai neither pay attention to it nor even seem to see it. It is also very obvious that it is not enough to cause damage to the order of the concessions. Now, a compilation of various situations is as follows:

Pointless Attacks, No Need to Pay Attention

The English-language *China Press* stated that since Italy's participation in the war, a certain newspaper published in Shanghai has relapsed to its old ways, like at the beginning of the European war on September 3rd of last year, and has begun to launch fierce propaganda attacks on foreign concessions in China. Its argument is that in order to guarantee the laws and order of the concessions, the powers should return the concessions to the so-called "Nanjing organization," and so on. There is absolutely no official comment here on this kind of speech, because the powers related to China have not recognized it. As for the opinions of the general public, they believe that the status of the concessions has nothing to do with a certain party. A certain authority pointed out, "We cannot stoop to comment and sully our mouths." It is believed that the constant babbling of a certain party's newspaper may not gain support, because Japan has decided not to intervene in the current situation in Europe and interfere with foreign concessions in China.

International Merchant Corps Strengthens Its Strength

The contribution of the Shanghai Municipal Council's International Merchant Corps to the defense of the Public Concession is very great. However, since the outbreak of the European war, most of the foreigners in Shanghai, in order to defend their motherland, have returned to the front line to join the army and serve on the battlefield, which has led to a sharp reduction in volunteer members. Among them, the British troops are particularly affected. The Commander of the Merchant Corps, Hamber, has repeatedly appealed to all parties to supplement the vacancies, and even hopes that employers will provide convenience to employees who join the volunteer corps. The British Consul-General's Office has also issued a notice to encourage British expatriates to participate enthusiastically. The Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Keswick, has made every effort to advocate for the enrichment of the International Merchant Corps, leading by example, and providing various conveniences to all British employees of Jardine Matheson, which he presides over, so that they can join. Recently, more than 20 employees of the company have officially joined and serve in the English Cavalry of the corps. In addition, Norwegian expatriates and Jewish refugees are also very enthusiastic about participating.

Air Force Personnel Returning to England for Service

Major Duke Cross, a member of the British Royal Air Force Association in Shanghai, will soon leave Shanghai and return to Canada to serve in the British army. The association held a banquet for Duke at the HSBC Building on the Bund at noon yesterday. At that time, the flags of various countries were hung in the room, and the Italian flag had been removed in advance, while the old flag of Austria was still inside. During the banquet, Duke gave a speech, saying that he was one of the reservists. This time, going to Canada will definitely be able to serve the British Air Force. There is no doubt about it. He has received many application letters from British expatriates here who are willing to enlist. After he arrives in Canada in the future, he will report this matter to the authorities and try to enable these people who are determined to serve the country to achieve their goals.

French Ambassador Bids Farewell to Enlisted Soldiers

The French Ex-Servicemen Association in Shanghai held a tea party yesterday evening (the 14th) at 6:30 pm at the French Police Headquarters to bid farewell to the French youths who were called up for military service. The French Ambassador to China, Cosme, and Consul-General Olin were invited to participate.

Italian Embassy Completed Relocation

Since Italy declared its participation in the war, the Italian Embassy at No. 118 Route Pere Robert and the Ambassador's residence, in order to avoid accidents, in addition to automatically suspending the hanging of the Italian flag, have also moved all documents and archives to the Italian Consulate on Chengdu Road for several days. All personnel have also moved out automatically. The relocation work was completed yesterday. The reporter went to inspect the place yesterday and saw that the iron gate of the embassy was ajar, and two French and Chinese police officers were stationed at the door. The interior of the embassy was empty and lonely, with few people. Only five or six French and Chinese police officers were walking back and forth, strictly guarding it. The scene was very deserted. The Italian Consulate on Chengdu Road is working as usual, and because the embassy staff has moved in, the number of people entering and leaving has increased, which is busier than before.

Route Amiral Courbet Street Sign Missing

The English-language *China Press* reported that Route Amiral Courbet in the French Concession, which is named after the Italian King Umberto III, the street sign at one end of the road near the corner of Route Pere Robert was suddenly missing this morning (the 14th). According to witnesses, they told the French Concession police that they had seen a foreigner and a Chinese person remove the street sign there between 9 and 10 o'clock last night (the 13th). French officials said that the name of Route Amiral Courbet will not be changed.

Tram Company Italian Resignations

According to foreign sources, two Italian employees of the French-owned Le Tramway Français de Shanghai have voluntarily resigned. In their resignation letters, they stated that they were very satisfied with everything about the company in the past, but because most of the employees in the company were French, they were willing to voluntarily retire to avoid friction in the future. It is also learned that two other Italian employees who have worked in the company for many years will also take the same approach and voluntarily submit their resignations to the company.

### New York Establishes Central Committee to Raise Funds for Chinese Disaster Relief

The *Continental Daily News* reported that the American Advisory Committee in this city, representing the American Committee for China Relief, is the central organization for distributing American relief funds. In the past year, it has allocated an average of 100,000 yuan per month to engage in relief work in various parts of China. Recently, a committee member of the association told reporters that although the United States is very concerned about the urgent needs of European war refugees, it is expected that the relief funds designated by the United States for use in China will not be reduced. This city has received news that the various church groups of the American Committee for China Relief have recently established a central committee in New York to raise funds for relief work in China and European countries. The committee members are all people who are particularly familiar with the situation in various parts of the world. After receiving appeals from various places, they are responsible for distributing relief funds. It is expected that the central committee will soon allocate a considerable amount of relief funds to China, because the situation in China, which has suffered from natural disasters and wars, is even worse than that in Europe. Relief workers in this city and the American Advisory Committee all believe that the relief funds that the central committee will allocate to China must be more than those allocated by the Church Committee, so relief work can be more effective than before. At the same time, the Shanghai American Advisory Committee continues to allocate funds to various uncommitted relief areas. The association held a meeting on Tuesday and approved the allocation of huge amounts of relief funds to Peiping and other districts. According to reports received by the association, there is a drought in Hebei and Shandong provinces in North China, and there is a risk of famine. For example, reports from Jinan stated that there was no harvest of wheat at all, and farmers could no longer cultivate the land, so there is no hope for the autumn harvest. During the meeting on Tuesday, the association approved other relief funds, including 22,000 yuan for Hangzhou, 25,000 yuan for the welfare program for children in North China, and 5,000 yuan for Huzhou.

### Legal Tender and US Dollar Called Strong, Already the Only Free Currency

The English-language *Finance & Commerce* published this Thursday stated that the currencies of all countries in the world are now subject to artificial control. Only the US dollar and legal tender are still free currencies and are not subject to control. Since Italy announced its participation in the war, speculation has been greatly reduced. Those who hold foreign exchange positions are rushing to get out, and those who tend to be bullish can be said to have completely disappeared. Recently, due to the world situation, the foreign exchange market has been volatile and the risk of speculation is very high. Speculators who sold British exchange and bought US exchange in the middle of last week have all lost money.

### British, Italian, and German Expatriate Merchants in Shanghai Mutually Prohibit Commercial Dealings, British Chamber of Commerce Lists German Company Names, Italian Merchants Have Begun to Wind Down Business

Since Italy participated in the war, the British Embassy in Shanghai issued a notice warning expatriate merchants not to trade with the enemy, and listed nine Italian commercial institutions in Shanghai, urging expatriate merchants to pay special attention to them. It is now learned that the United Kingdom had already taken this measure against Germany. No less than 200 German commercial institutions are listed as requiring special attention, and more than 80 of these institutions are located in Shanghai. Now, according to what was published by the British Chamber of Commerce on June 8, excerpts are listed as follows: China Electric Company Limited, 267 Jiangxi Road; Eklifa Yangxing, 261 Sichuan Road; Bayer Pharmaceutical Unlimited Company, 138 Jiangxi Road; Tianxiang Yangxing, 356 Beijing Road; Baidaoerfu Pharmaceutical Company, 346 Sichuan Road; Bairu Yangxing, 2 Beijing Road; Lihe Yangxing, 670 Sichuan Road; Qianxin Machinery Co., Ltd., 138 Jiangxi Road; Qianxin Yangxing, 236-138 Jiangxi Road; Kedinghe Hardware Company, 2 Beijing Road; Defu Yangxing, 261 Sichuan Road; Taimike Factory, 451 Jiangxi Road; Dehua Bank, 85 Jiujiang Road; German Gold and Silver Chemical Products Company, 133 Yuanmingyuan Road; Ailishi Yangxing, 261 Sichuan Road; German News Agency, 75 Guangdong Road; Yitai Company, 20 Guangdong Road; Fuluo Yangxing, 30 Fuzhou Road; German Railway Travel Agency, 97 Renji Road; Yali Yangxing, 410 Sichuan Road; Xiwang Company, 110 Sichuan Road; Yixin Yangxing, 133 Yuanmingyuan Road; Hengbao Shipping Company, 20 Guangdong Road; Jialinbao Hardware Machinery Factory, 133 Yuanmingyuan Road; Gaole Yangxing, 133 Yuanmingyuan Road; Kelaoxi Machinery United Company, 227 Hamilton House; Kongshi Yangxing, 110 Sichuan Road; and so on.

Italian Merchants Winding Down

Since the Italian merchants and foreign firms in Shanghai received the notice from the Italian Consul-General to stop business with British and French foreign firms, they began to wind down their business with foreign firms. Because the number of Italian merchants in Shanghai is not large, and the scope of business is not as extensive as that of other foreign firms, such as Kaili Yangxing, in the usual scope of business, in addition to various supplies to the Shanghai garrison, foreign trade is very small. Now it specializes in contracting military supplies, so after receiving the order, it mostly announced the clearing within two days.

### Japanese Aircraft Attack Chongqing, Indiscriminate Bombing of Civilians

Yesterday's *North-China Daily News* published a letter from Chongqing stating that when Japanese aircraft attacked Chongqing on May 28, they committed the most cruel massacre. At that time, countless civilians gathered at the entrance of an air-raid shelter in the Southern District, and before they could enter the shelter, Japanese aircraft saw them and threw bombs at them continuously, killing about 100 civilians. The letter stated, "I believe the Japanese military spokesman in Shanghai will again call this a military target." In this attack on Chongqing, Japanese aircraft also paid special attention to the factory area. A factory in the suburbs was hit by as many as 60 bombs. However, the Japanese even claimed that Japanese aircraft had destroyed China's emerging industry and Chinese airfield.

### Shanghai American Chamber of Commerce Advocates Expanding Shipping, New Ships Will Sail to the Far East, Related to Shanghai's Prosperity

The American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai believes that there are too few ships in the Far East and advocates increasing shipping to the Far East. It is heard that in the near future, the United States will have new ships joining the Far East shipping. The number of Japanese ships in China is only half of what it was before August 13. Since the European war, the Far East shipping has become more and more depressed, so the increase in American ships is of great importance to the market. All parties are paying attention to it.

### Gas Price to Increase Tomorrow, Surcharge Increased to 158%, Approved by the Shanghai Municipal Council's Public Utilities Committee

The Shanghai Gas Company recently submitted a budget for this year to the Shanghai Municipal Council, requesting permission to increase the gas surcharge from 80% to 158% due to the soaring prices of various goods and the sharp increase in the company's operating expenses, especially fuel. According to the company, the cost of fuel alone last year was only 2,356,388 yuan, while this year's estimate is about 6,617,000 yuan. In addition, employee salaries, subsidies, and various material resources have all increased due to soaring prices. As for the amount of gas sold, although it has increased compared to last year, the cost of the increased portion is significant due to coal prices. Based on the above, an increase in price is necessary to make up for the shortfall. The Public Utilities Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Council held two meetings on the 7th and 11th of this month to discuss the matter, and invited company representatives to attend and explain in order to show prudence. As a result, the committee members all believed that the company's statement was in line with the actual situation and should be approved, and will be implemented from the time when the gas use period ends on or after July 16. However, the Bureau may reconsider it within three months. The above proposal has been approved by the Board of Directors of the Bureau at its regular meeting on the 12th of this month.

### Attacking Yichang, Bombing Chongqing, Japanese Army Accomplishes Nothing, Peace Rumors Denied by the Chinese Side, Terrorist Policies Prolong the War

According to Mr. Han Ellis of the American *China Economic Review* in Shanghai, in recent weeks, rumors of peace between China and Japan have not been prevalent in the Shanghai stock market. Some people even believe that the Japanese army's fierce attack on Yichang and the bombing of Chongqing are enough to promote peace negotiations between China and Japan. However, in his opinion, the Japanese army's fierce attack on Yichang is just enough to prove the endlessness of the Sino-Japanese war. The National Government's firm denial of peace and its expression of its determination to continue the war are all powerful evidence. The cargo transportation between the Yangtze River and Shanghai will be cut off due to the war in Yichang. The goods transported from Shanghai to various parts of Western Sichuan through the war zone may not be sold smoothly, especially textiles. However, on the contrary, Japan's industry has not improved recently. Japan's largest mine has announced its suspension due to the bank's refusal to grant loans.

### Last Year's French Concession, Public Health Improved, Efforts Made to Rectify Various Facilities, Number of Jewish Doctors Increased

According to the French Municipal Council's Department of Health's annual report, the health situation improved greatly last year. The previous situation was extremely chaotic. The high mortality rate last year was the same as in 1938. It is particularly noteworthy that 72 out of every 100 registered deaths were children.

Smallpox Eradication Very Effective

The report investigates the main types of diseases and points out that in the first week of January 1940, smallpox was prevalent, with 69 cases, which then decreased and completely disappeared in May. The percentage of foreign deaths was 31.81, while the number of Chinese deaths was 37.72. The smallpox epidemic in the winter of 1938 proved the necessity of prevention. The number of people vaccinated exceeded 540,091. Vaccination of newborn babies was also strictly enforced.

Typhoid Prevention Good

The prevention of typhoid and paratyphoid fever in Shanghai is also very good. Last year's typhoid fever gradually declined from the fierce momentum that began the year before. After August, the number was lower than in the same month of the previous year. There were only 1,218 cases of typhoid fever and 508 deaths. The origin of this infectious disease does not come from tap water, because the drinking water supplied by the French Tap Water Company is of very good quality, and some well water is also managed.

Cholera Patients Mostly Not Injected

The first occurrence of cholera was in June last year. Later, there were a total of 77 cases recorded, with 13 deaths. Statistics show that 77.92% of those infected had not been vaccinated. The effectiveness of vaccination can be further proved by the soldiers in each camp. Due to the mandatory vaccination of soldiers, none of them developed the disease.

Disinfection Work Also Very Active

The reorganization of disinfection services this year also attempts to improve the health situation and hopes to achieve active disinfection services through education and cooperation with social figures. In its investigation, investigators issued announcements in four languages: French, English, Russian, and Chinese. The Chinese are also gradually understanding the need for patients to wear disinfected clothing.

Testing Milk, Filling Earth Wells

In the next year, the French Concession may not have any cases of rabies. Although 228 Chinese and foreigners went to treat rabies this year, the French Concession's milk disinfection began in 1939. The testing of unclean milk continues. Some new wells have been dug, and the deep wells have reached 55. Some Chinese wells have been proven to be unclean, and the South Mouth Chamber has been completely filled.

Factory Hygiene Gradually Improving

As of the end of last year, there were 1,600 licensed factories. The facilities in smaller factories are extremely poor, and most of them need to improve ventilation and lighting. Vaccination for smallpox and injection for cholera and typhoid fever must be followed by workers in these factories.

Clearing Garbage, Cremating Corpses

Garbage removal in the French Concession has encountered difficulties, but by the end of the year, it was no longer a problem. Charitable organizations have been entrusted with burial work, burying 2,315 unclaimed adults and cremating 13,671 children's corpses. Because the movement on the Huangpu River is restricted, the authorities have had to implement cremation work for unclaimed corpses throughout the year. Therefore, a total of 17,669 corpses were cremated.

More Than Two Thousand Chinese and Foreign Doctors

The number of foreign doctors registered last year was extremely high, due to the arrival of Jewish refugees in Shanghai. The number of Chinese doctors has decreased slightly. At the end of last year, there were a total of 2,256 doctors, both Chinese and foreign, registered with the French Municipal Council.

School Hygiene Very Satisfactory

The school hygiene situation of the Municipal Council was also investigated. There are 900 Chinese and foreign students in each school. The results of the investigation showed that there were no cases of smallpox or cholera. A small number of diphtheria cases occurred in the Russian schools and kindergartens established by the Municipal Council, but injections were added to prevent the spread.

### Indigo Cloth Transported to the Mainland, Detained in Vietnam, Local Government Suspects German Goods, Manufacturers Ask the French Consulate in Shanghai for Proof

Since the Anti-Japanese War, the transportation of various goods to the rear has mostly been transshipped through Vietnam and transported to the mainland via the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway. Because of the needs of the people in the mainland, freight transportation is very busy, especially for cloth. The reason is that the people in various occupied areas of the country have moved to the mainland, resulting in a population increase of several times more than in the past. Clothing is a non-expendable item, so it is even more popular. Recently, because Italy implemented its participation in the war, the three countries of Britain, France, and Italy each notified their national commercial firms to mutually prohibit the transaction of all goods from enemy countries, so the cloth transported from Shanghai to various parts of the mainland and transshipped through Vietnam will be detained if there is a suspicion of German trademarks. It is heard that the recently exported "indigo" has been detained in Vietnam because "indigo" is a German registered trademark. It is found that in addition to the trademark being registered by Germany, the raw materials for dyeing, weaving, and spinning on the cloth are all domestic products. The manufacturers in Shanghai were shocked after hearing about it, and have sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to ask the French Consulate in Shanghai to provide proof in order to facilitate commercial transportation and maintain the inherent good relations between China and France.

### Canadian Commercial Representative Returns Home for Instructions, Italian-Canadian Diplomatic Relations Should be Severed After the War

After Italy declared war on France, Canada followed suit and declared war on Italy. Canadian officials in Shanghai also prohibited contact with the Italian side and severed diplomatic relations. Major Sykes, the Canadian government's commercial representative in Shanghai, is scheduled to leave Shanghai and return home tomorrow for instructions.

### Japan Admits Two Chinese Army Divisions Approaching Hangzhou, Nearly 100,000 Crossing the Qiantang River

It is heard that nearly 100,000 regular Chinese troops have crossed the Qiantang River and are scattered in various important strongholds. Even the Japanese military spokesman admitted that the 108th Division and the 192nd Division of the Chinese army have approached Hangzhou, Huzhou, and other places.

### The Incident on Haig Road the Night Before: Both Sides Resolve Peacefully, Arising from a False Policeman's Traffic Violation, Chinese and Vietnamese Constables Detained and Then Released

The French Police Department dispatched Chinese and Vietnamese constables, along with female clerks, to inspect pedestrians in front of Jiaotong University on Haig Road in Xujiahui at approximately 5 PM on the 12th. A person posing as a policeman drove by in a car, violating traffic regulations and being rebuked by the patrol. The fake policeman refused to yield and retorted before leaving. He then entered Jiaotong University to report to the Japanese military police stationed there, who then rushed out in force and dragged the French police's Chinese and Vietnamese constables into the "Police Station" beside the Jiaotong University headquarters. Upon receiving the report, the French Police Department dispatched personnel to negotiate. It is now learned that the French Police Department sent personnel to negotiate with officials from the Japanese Military Police Headquarters in West Shanghai. As a result, the detained Chinese and Vietnamese constables were released at 8:30 PM that night and regained their freedom.

According to the North China Daily News:

At approximately 5:30 PM on the 12th of this month, a "Municipal Police" officer drove a car near Jiaotong University on Haig Road in the French Concession. The car did not display a permit, violating traffic regulations. A Chinese constable from the French Police Department stopped him and asked the "Municipal Police" officer to accompany him to the nearby police station. Unexpectedly, the "Municipal Police" officer refused, saying the matter could be resolved at the nearest "Municipal Police Station."

Confrontation Ensues

Several other "Municipal Police" officers and a Vietnamese constable from the French Concession arrived. To avoid causing trouble, the Chinese and Vietnamese constables accompanied the "Municipal Police" officer who violated traffic regulations to the nearest "police station," but were then detained. Senior officers from the French Police Department, officers from the Japanese Military Police, and "Municipal Government" personnel rushed to the "police station" to mediate. At 8:30 PM, the detained Chinese and Vietnamese constables were released. While mediation was underway inside the "police station,"

During Mediation

a car belonging to a high-ranking Chinese "official" suddenly became involved in a dispute with a pedestrian outside the "police station." Onlookers gathered, and the "Municipal Police," fearing a riot, rushed out of the "police station" and fired two shots into the air, dispersing the crowd. Yesterday morning (the 13th), a certain Japanese newspaper published this news, claiming that the "Municipal Police" and the French Concession patrol exchanged gunfire. However, French sources have emphatically denied this, refuting the claim that the French Concession patrol used firearms. Reportedly, the matter between the French Concession patrol and the "police station"

Involved No Gunfire

Furthermore, the English-language Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury reported that both the French Concession authorities and the "Municipal Government" announced this morning (the 14th) that the incident involving police officers from both sides on Haig Road on the evening of the 12th had been "amicably resolved." According to a French Concession police officer, the matter stemmed from a misunderstanding, and a "Municipal Police" officer fired two shots into the air to disperse a large crowd of onlookers.

### Sweet Rain after a Long Drought: Light Rain Fell Yesterday, but the Amount Was Minimal

Since the beginning of summer, the amount of rainfall in this city and surrounding areas has been scarce, especially in the past month. The land is parched, and farmers are anxious. According to a reporter from the Pingming News Agency who consulted the Xujiahui Observatory yesterday, the record of rainfall in this city since May 17th until yesterday is unprecedentedly low, totaling only 2.4 centimeters. In the same period last year, it reached 49.7 centimeters. However, the

Total Rainfall

from January 1st to yesterday is not less than last year. The total amount of rainfall from the beginning of the year to June 14th last year was 352.8 centimeters, while this year's total from the beginning of the year to yesterday is 374.3 centimeters. Therefore, the total rainfall this year is actually more than in previous years, but since May 17th, it has been unprecedentedly scarce. The rainfall from 5 AM to 3 PM yesterday was 3.5 centimeters. Due to the scarcity of past rainfall, river water has become shallow, and

Rice Paddies are Cracked

Counties around this city such as Songjiang, Qingpu, Kunshan, Taicang, and Jiading are rice-producing areas. The soil is dry and cracked, causing difficulties in transplanting seedlings, leading to early signs of drought. Villagers irrigate the land day and night, but the water dries up quickly. In higher areas, even the river water is gradually drying up. Therefore, farmers in the surrounding areas are very concerned about the drought. The western suburbs of this city, including Meilong, Xinzhuang, Qidou, and Pudong, are

Early Rice Regions

and are especially eager for rain. Some speculative rice merchants, knowing that Shanghai's rice reserves are still substantial, are using this as an excuse to raise rice prices. Vegetable prices have also been rising for days. At the same time, the dry climate has led to a prevalence of throat ailments, which is harmful to people's health. Therefore, people in this city and the surrounding areas have been eagerly hoping for sweet rain. Until 5 AM yesterday, dark clouds covered the sky and light rain fell intermittently until the evening. This is of great benefit to agriculture and is also beneficial to people's health.

### Law School Student Feng Ruiwei Sentenced to Four Months for Fraud, Xi Shaofen Acquitted

Chen Zongtao, a young man from Guangdong, and Feng Ruizhang, from Wujin, are both students at the Shanghai Law School. In December last year, Feng borrowed a check for 37,300 yuan from Chen and exchanged it for cash with Xi Shaofen, a female clerk at the former Lianglu Bureau, promising to cash it on a specific date. When Xi tried to cash it, it bounced. She reported it to the French police, who pursued the issuer of the check, Chen Zongtao, and sent him to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Special No. 2 Court, where he was sentenced to a fine of 600 yuan. Chen, feeling unjustly implicated, hired lawyers Xu Wufang and Lu Ronggan to represent him. They submitted a petition to the Criminal Court of the Special No. 2 Court, accusing Feng Ruizhang and Xi Shaofen of jointly committing fraud and deceiving him out of a large check. Judge Li 　shan tried the case. The defendant Feng hired lawyer Fang Junjie for defense, and Xi hired Jiang Yiping, Ge Bangren, and Shao Jingkang as lawyers for defense. The court ruled that Feng had provided a reliable surety of 15,000 yuan. The judgment was delivered yesterday morning: "Judgment" Feng Ruizhang is sentenced to four months of imprisonment for fraud, Xi Shaofen is acquitted.

### A Greedy Subletter Oppresses Tenants to Evict Them: British Wife Suffers Assault, Police Dispatch Detectives After Receiving Report

The corner house at No. 96 Rue Lupan and No. 2 Avenue Paul Beau in the French Concession was leased from the China Business Company by Gao Fengxi from Shandong, who opened the Defeng Western Restaurant there with a monthly rent of 146 yuan. Due to poor business, the restaurant closed in April this year. Gao then

Sublet the Entire House

to more than ten households, earning 400-500 yuan in rent each month, making a significant profit. Recently, Gao, because the house contract was about to expire at the end of this year, sublet the house to Ding Hongxiang, the owner of the Hongguang Company at No. 103 Rue du Consulat, for a large sum of money, and notified all tenants to contact Ding regarding housing matters in the future. At the same time, Ding stopped collecting rent from the first of this month and notified each tenant to

Vacate by a Deadline

When this had no effect, he issued a second notice a few days ago, setting a three-day deadline to vacate, threatening to cut off water and electricity. The tenants were planning a response when, unexpectedly, at around 9 AM yesterday, a dozen workers arrived at the house to intimidate the tenants. One of them broke into the room of Mr. Leet, a British customs official at No. 2, whose Chinese wife, Jin Ming, and her sister, Jin Yao, were

Still Asleep

After being awakened, they questioned him, leading to a conflict. A group of men rushed in from outside and resorted to violence, severely beating the Jin sisters. At that time, the Lujiawan Police Station suddenly received a phone report stating that a shooting had occurred on Rue Lupan. They immediately dispatched a large number of detectives and a police vehicle to investigate. Only then did they understand what was happening, but

The Assailants

had already fled. The watchman of the house, Zhou Changshou, the owner of the Changxinji Clothing Store, the subletter Gao Fengxi, and the victims, the Jin sisters, were all taken to the police station for questioning.

Zheng Renhe then married his wife's younger sister, Fang, as his second wife. In 1935, Renhe also died in Shanghai. His remaining children and property were managed by Fang, as the second wife and guardian. Later, Fang became unfaithful, resulting in her abdomen becoming gradually larger. Zheng Zhuangshi, the aunt, hired lawyer Yu Hualong to file a lawsuit in the Civil Court of the Special No. 2 Court against Zheng Fang, demanding the return of the children and property. The court ruled that the defendant should hand over the children and property to the original guardian, Zheng Zhuangshi. Recently, Zheng Zhuangshi, claiming that her daughter-in-law Fang had sold the Hua Wu Tailor Shop, which had a capital of tens of thousands of yuan, to her confidant Zhu Zhicheng for a low price of 3,750 yuan during the litigation period, which was clearly a conspiracy to harm her grandchildren's property, hired lawyer He Xiaoyuan in her capacity as legal representative to file another lawsuit in the Civil Court of the Special No. 2 Court against Zheng Fang and Zhu Zhicheng, seeking to confirm the invalidity of the sales contract. Judge Li Liang opened the trial yesterday and summoned both parties, who arrived with their lawyers. After arguments, the court declared that the case was clear and set a date for judgment.

The morning 　was 5,400 yuan, and 　the market outlook was still good. Due to the weakening and strengthening of the foreign exchange market, money changers 　immediately sold, falling 　to 5,320 yuan. This was because gold shops and securities firms 　were seen 　coming to absorb it, rising to 5,450 yuan. The noon close retreated to 5,400 yuan. The afternoon market was silent, with few transactions. After opening, due to continued purchases by gold shops, the price rose to 5,440 yuan. Money changers 　 sold, and gold shops returned, falling 　70-80 yuan. However, the closing 　recovered, reaching 5,395 yuan, which was 70 yuan higher than the previous day's close. The total daily transaction volume decreased, by about 4,000 taels. Jewelry shops raised their jewelry prices by 10 yuan. Customs gold remained the same.

Spot Gold Rises 70 Yuan

From the morning, each bar (ten taels), initially due to the 　contraction of the exchange rate and the tightening of the US Dollar, the market opened 75 yuan higher. Gold shops bought 50 taels from silver shops for 5,400 yuan. 　Silver shops helped to absorb it, but at this time, money changers and retail investors all intended to sell. 　The price was raised by 10 yuan again. Silver shops helped money changers to buy 10 taels for 5,410 yuan. Then, buyers decreased, and securities firms also came to sell, causing the price to fall back by 90 yuan. A certain silver shop bought 50 taels from fellow shops and 10 taels from gold shops, all for 5,320 yuan. After this, sellers disappeared, and the price then rose again. When the market reached the 5,4 　50 yuan mark, retail 　were short, rushed to cover, and securities firms, gold shops, and silver shops also competed to buy, and the price again broke through the 5,400 yuan mark. Silver shops made 20 taels with each other, reaching as high as 5,450 yuan. Later, buyers' appetites faded, and the price gradually fell. Money changers and securities firms sold each other, and before the close, the price fell back to the 5,400 yuan mark. Securities firms sold 10 taels to silver shops, losing 5,380 yuan, and then gold shops traded 20 taels with each other, rising back to 5,400 yuan as the noon closing price. After the close, securities firms suddenly came to drag in, once rising to 5,415 yuan. In the afternoon, there was a lack of buyers. Silver shops first sold 10 taels to other shops for 5,400 yuan. Then, gold shops suddenly came to search for purchases, raising the price by 40 yuan in scarce trading. Gold shops bought 20 taels from securities firms, rising to 5,440 yuan. Later, buyers hesitated to move forward, and the price fell slightly downward. In addition, money changers and gold shops tended to sell, and retail investors sold short, and money changers sold 10 taels to silver shops, losing 5,360 yuan. Later, other shops suddenly switched from selling to buying, and short-sellers also came to cover due to overnight considerations, raising the price by 35 yuan.

As a result, it rose 70 yuan compared to the previous day's close, with a total fluctuation of 130 yuan throughout the day.

The current standard gold was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed price, and there was little trading.

Jewelry Prices Raised by 10 Yuan

The exchange rate for jewelry gold was 　. Initially, Datong was still offering 550 yuan on the 5th. At 11:15, the price was raised by 10 yuan, and there were no changes after the close. It is estimated that Datong has changed to offering 560 yuan, and the new shops offer the same price. The buying price has been reduced by about 30 yuan.

### Foreign Currencies Increase in Value

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw spot gold fluctuate upwards. The demand for Sterling and US gold pounds was not weak, and market prices all rose by 2 yuan. There was no lack of demand for gold tickets, and market prices fell in the morning and rose in the afternoon. Because the price of Sterling was viewed as long-term and contracted, the public demand for US gold tickets was strong, and market prices rose by another 10 cents. Hong Kong tickets followed the Hong Kong-Shanghai exchange rate, rising by 2 cents. The supply of Japanese gold tickets was limited, and the evening market fell to 1.08 yuan. The supply of Korean tickets was abundant, and the evening market fell to 93 cents.

### Securities: Afternoon Trading of Domestic Debt More Frequent Due to Specific Reasons

In the unofficial securities market, yesterday's market conditions continued to show weakness in the morning and strength in the afternoon. Those taking long positions were burdened by high interest rates and took advantage of the market's rule that trades executed in the afternoon are settled the next morning. Within this single day, they could avoid taking delivery of the goods and thus avoid paying interest, allowing them to execute the scalping technique.

While rumors were still rampant in Shanghai, there was a subtle undercurrent of stability. Market sentiment has been tempered over time and is no longer easily stimulated by ordinary news. Yesterday, most buyers and sellers still settled transactions on a next-day basis, with scalping activity also quite lively. However, Tongji's selling of Class A shares attracted some attention. Lianyi and Lianhe also showed more selling than buying, while Jiufeng exchanged Class E and Class A shares for domestic varieties. The market prices showed some slight differences, and the final result was that, compared to the previous day, Class A shares fell by a slight five points, while Class D shares did not open at all throughout the day, and the remaining shares rose slightly by one or two jiao or so. The total transaction volume was approximately 800,000 to 900,000 yuan. A simplified table is provided below.

Furthermore, the sharp rise of [day] was almost ten [unclear characters]), and a drop of more than one yuan could only be seen as a normal reaction. Shanghai stock market operators did not pay attention to this, and trading was very quiet. Brokers, on this occasion, if there are no major international events, can explain this kind of increasingly narrow turnover, and how will the hidden worries about the future be? Most of the floaters in the market had cleared their positions in advance, so the "cutting long" scene was not seen yesterday. British Union shares and Jardine Matheson shares accounted for 40% of the total transaction volume throughout the day. The opening prices of various stocks were almost the same as the previous day and the initial morning prices. Rubber stocks were the same.

London, 13th (Thursday) Dispatch: Today's listed prices of British Far East companies' stocks saw mixed gains and losses. Mercantile Bank shares fell half a pound to seven and a half pounds. Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation shares rose two shillings and six pence to a price of twelve pounds, seven shillings, and six pence. The rest remained flat.

London, 13th (Thursday dispatch): Today's listed prices of Chinese foreign debt remained flat. There were no changes in the prices of various bonds.

### Cotton Yarn: Guangdong Merchants Purchasing Coarse Yarn, Shuangma Halted Before Falling

The yarn market is stable, and the downward trend has been curbed, thanks to the stable foreign exchange rate and the calming of sentiment. At the same time, sales in the South China region are particularly strong for 10-count coarse yarn, which helps to maintain the situation. However, general speculators buy low and sell high, so market transactions remain lively.

In the morning opening of spot yarn, it was heard that the US exchange rate was shrinking, and sentiment was good, with strong buying interest. 20-count Shuangma [unclear character] was 1,140 yuan. As soon as this price opened, sellers rushed to sell, and there were looser chips in the market. The market fell straight to 1,090 yuan. Soon, due to the eager purchase of coarse yarn by [unclear character] Guangdong merchants and the shrinking of foreign exchange, [unclear character] accounts became active, [unclear character] rose again to 1,114 yuan to close the session.

### Local Cotton Mills Need to Shut Down

The quietness of local cotton transactions is as rare as phoenix feathers. The factory's needs are dull due to the ordinary yarn market. In addition, the recent arrival of Indian and American cotton has been continuous, so sentiment is sluggish, and the market remains quiet. Only 100 pieces of Indian cotton, Sikedeng cotton, were traded among peers, with a price of 110 yuan for delivery at the pier.

Another report: The price of foreign cotton in New York, in the early morning yesterday, first rose by more than 20 pounds due to the news of Liverpool's opening [unclear character] and rising prices. Then, due to the weakness of stock prices on Wall Street, the market returned to weakness. As a result, closing prices rose by three to five pounds for the near-term contracts compared to the previous day, and fell by two or three pounds for the far-term contracts. The Liverpool cotton market has been closed since May 17th, and it has been almost a month now. Yesterday, the opening price rose by more than 30 to more than 70 pounds.

Shanghai's foreign cotton trade, the current price has been [unclear character] in a stable state, trade is also gradually [unclear character] dawn, but the number is not large. Due to the tension of the European war, the transport of cotton has become more difficult. At the same time, the steady rise of American cotton, so the industry thinks [unclear character] pro-American tendency.

### Piece Goods: Small Retailers Seeking to Sell, Cloth Prices Continue to Fall; Down by One-Third From Peak

Domestic cloth market continued to be weak yesterday, and small retailers were eager to sell, uniformly cutting prices. However, cloth [unclear character] has fallen by one-third from its peak, and the number of factories suspending work is increasing daily. As foreign cotton [unclear character] rises and yarn prices stabilize, large retailers seem calmer, so the downward trend has eased. Yesterday, loose white goods fell by 2.5 jiao, bleached and dyed cloth fell by 3.5 jiao. Large lots remained flat. The street traded several thousand pieces of bleached light-colored summer cloth and blue cloth, more than 200 [unclear character] of coarse cloth blanks, more than 100 pieces of Zhejiang and Anhui merchant-handled coarse cloth, colored cloth, and foreign yarn, and nearly 100 boxes of Guangdong and Yunnan merchant-handled Shilin cloth and colored twill.

East cloth first rose and then weakened. Longtou fine cloth opened at 35.8 yuan in the morning. Then, due to the release of funds by peers, it went downstream step by step. The closing price at noon was 35.2 yuan. The market sentiment continued to be weak, and the number of traders was sparse, falling to 35 yuan. The price of Four Gentlemen's Serge fell to 8.9 jiao.

### Grain: Rice Prices Ease Slightly, Recover in the Afternoon

After the rice market tightened the day before yesterday, the market opened yesterday morning, and suddenly, due to the cold and rainy weather, sentiment turned soft. Sales were stagnant, and with nearly 200,000 bags of newly traded foreign rice, sentiment could not help but turn flat. Therefore, the price of foreign rice once fell by half a yuan. If Huojiao only sold for 54.5 yuan, Xiaowen for 52.5 yuan, gradually driven by general sales from inland rural customers, the market turned [unclear character].

The arrival of glutinous rice is scarce, and the stock is not weak, but sales are meager, making it difficult to compete with other goods. Supply and demand are similar, and the market is not much up or down. Sales are open to all, and all abide by the previous [unclear character] disk.

Due to the relationship between Kang and Bi, the price of coarse rice in the mainland is [unclear character] expensive, attracting firm sentiment, resulting in continuous soaring prices in the black market outside the market, creating an unprecedented peak. Yesterday, although there was timely rain, it was rumored that it was still difficult to curb its sharpness in the black market. General cargo owners still held on, considering that their own capital and later goods were limited, and they were unwilling to sell easily, [unclear character] in support. Fortunately, on the customer side, except for those who needed to buy out of necessity, others were more relaxed than before. As a result, the selling price was still stable.

The flour market was quite firm yesterday. In terms of sales, in addition to retail transactions on this street, customer orders continued to be inquired by the Nanyang Gang, and the Beiyang Gang also intended to add to their purchases.

### The Hardships of Missionaries (II)

After the Western missionary A. Qiba encountered difficulties in spreading the gospel in Changsha, he continued in his letter to a friend, saying: "When people on the shore saw my boat, they shouted and threw bricks, stones, mud, and sand, like rain. Fortunately, a gunboat rushed over and took me into its boat. Another gunboat pulled my boat away. I was covered in mud, but there was no great harm. But several people who saved me on the gunboat were seriously injured. Later, two county magistrates came to the gunboat to watch, but they did not suppress the situation. They only said that they would never allow the people to kill me. Then the gunboat docked on the other side, and the official said to me again that the people of Hunan were inherently strong. I did not answer him, but secretly thought that the local officials in Changsha had first blocked me for several days, waited until the villagers had gathered, and then invited me to the dock, so that I could fully taste the bricks and stones. I have never heard a word of suppression. I don't know if there is such a clause in the peace treaty. So I asked the official to arrest several people for investigation, but the official replied that he could not. At that time, the crowd was surging, and they had already pulled the boat across the river, shouting to kill the devil. The boatman in my boat had already fled. It was really impossible to tolerate. So I went back to the boat to take a few things for use and went to the gunboat, and sailed to a bay in the middle of the river in Changsha. After careful consideration, it is better to run away. I heard that the scholars in Xiangtan also had plans to harm me. There were thorns everywhere. How could I be accommodated! It has been the fourth time that the people of Changsha Prefecture have had trouble with the people in the church."

### The Rise of National Women

— Jin Gang

The flames of the European War caused unprecedented turmoil in the peaceful and leisurely old England for more than ten years. In the atmosphere of general mobilization, batches of warriors marched to the front, and majestic military songs floated in every street. The grand evening party will no longer play intoxicating music, and gentlemen have abandoned their long and beautiful lives. Some are serving in the army, and some are participating in various wartime jobs, but countless women with comfortable occupations are losing their jobs in batches. Women with families have tearfully bid farewell to their beloved husbands, and even their own children have to be evacuated to the countryside. Even the Queen's daughter is no exception. Indeed, war is cruel, changing the content of everyone's life.

Naturally, in this war of national survival, every British citizen has his or her own responsibility. Women, like men, undertake many wartime service jobs in the rear. Now British women have several very important organizations. One is the "Women's Land Army," with more than 10,000 members. The captain is Lady Halldane, and the members are distributed in various army garrisons, cooking for the soldiers, washing clothes, and general comfort work. One is the "Women's Royal Naval Service," with 4,000 members. The captain is Lady Laurton Maud, and the members are distributed on various warships, responsible for washing, sweeping, cooking, and many miscellaneous tasks. One is the "Women's Auxiliary Air Force," with more than 12,000 members. The members are assigned to airfields to assist pilots in many tasks, as well as engineering duties. The women in each team serve the country as faithfully and bravely as men. In addition, the "Women's Voluntary Service" is the largest rear women's service organization, including women from all walks of life, with 500,000 members and branches all over the country. The "First Aid Nursing Yeomanry" and the "British Red Cross Society" are the women's organizations responsible for front and rear rescue work, which are full of thousands of strong, active, and brave British women!

Some of these women's team members are volunteers and also donate funds to the organization. Some are subsidized by the state. Many are women from aristocratic and wealthy families, who are usually surrounded by servants. But now they have become the servants of the soldiers. They endure endless hardships and consider it to be the supreme glory!

The commander-in-chief of these women's service teams is the Queen of England. She is responsible for the highest command. She extracts the most precious time day and night to work for the development and enrichment of these women's organizations. Naturally, the British resistance to Germany benefits greatly from these strong women's organizations!

### Striving for Work Efficiency

— Wang Tao

Many people only know how to work, but they don't pay attention to efficiency. If he works ten points and receives seven points of efficiency, that is a significant loss to him. However, this loss still exists universally, whether in you, in me... and in the vast strata.

Although we do not hope to immediately achieve the point of "doing half the work and getting twice the results," we should at least not lose money, not suffer losses, do ten points of work, and receive ten points of efficiency. Of course, we hope to receive twelve points or even fifteen points of efficiency, and strive for greater victory in our work.

At first glance, this seems to be a very boring and tedious thing, but the benefits it gives us are endless. Moreover, we are in a very turbulent era. The heavy responsibilities entrusted to us by the nation, the country, and society should be diligently completed. This endless work not only needs us to complete, but we must also strive for the greatest efficiency.

We can often see that a clerk in a cigarette paper shop works more than twelve hours a day, but he spends most of his time idly watching the scenery on the road and chatting idly. This is not only a waste of time, causing the work efficiency to be small, but also develops a terrible laziness towards work. This laziness not only exists in the clerk of the cigarette paper shop, but it exists in the office workers who put up their feet and chat idly in the office, the civil servants in the government agencies, the teachers and staff in the schools, the students... and everything else.

Regardless of industry, agriculture, military, education, or commerce, work and efficiency are inseparable. And this question needs us to reflect deeply, consider, and [unclear character]. We can see that in the factories of capitalist countries, the capitalists desperately squeeze the labor, increasing the working hours, even exceeding ten hours or more per day, but the efficiency received is not worth the price spent on the work. In the Soviet Union, because they wanted to strive for greater efficiency, they even reduced the working hours to six hours, and his efficiency often exceeded the work.

We also need this, just as the ancient saying says—"doing half the work and getting twice the results." First, we should deeply understand the nature of the work, and concentrate on the work; second, there should be appropriate adjustments. Working at the desk all day will not achieve the expected results. After work, we should have entertainment and exercise. So that our work is properly adjusted, and the efficiency is improved.

### Miscellany: Two Million Colors

— Lan Ping

According to the statistics of famous scientists, if a person's eyes are not colorblind or have other diseases, they can distinguish an average of two million different colors.

### Pulse and Life

The normal pulse rate is 72 beats per minute, which is the most regular. People with this number of pulse beats usually have a longer lifespan than others. People with short lives have an average pulse rate that is about three beats per minute higher than those with long lives. This does not mean that people with fast pulse rates are necessarily short-lived, but only that the average lifespan of people with fast pulse rates is shorter. However, there are many exceptions, so people with fast pulse rates do not need to worry.

### Cat's Eyes

Can cats see in the dark? I think many people will answer "yes." But this answer is actually wrong. Cat's eyes are just more sensitive than humans, so cats can find things in dim light while humans cannot. In absolute darkness, even cats cannot see. What we commonly think of as dark places actually have some light, so cats can see.

### Hawthorne Case: The Dancer's Fate

— By Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter 1: "A Very Pretty Miss!"

He murmured: It's really strange. Brother Jin Shou, how did you think of searching for bullets?

Ni replied: "The people in this house said that they heard gunshots after midnight last night, which led to the discovery of this murder case. I looked at the straight line of the fatal wound and found this bullet on the wall. I just pried it out when you arrived."

Hawthorne said: "How many people are in this house? Have you questioned them?"

"I've only talked a few words roughly and haven't asked in detail yet. There are not many people in the house. There is an old man named Li Zifan, who is the deceased's uncle. A maid named Jinmei, and an old nanny and a caretaker named Lao Mao."

"I think it's best to talk to that uncle first—oh, wait a minute. This cigarette holder on this desk seems a little out of place." As Hawthorne spoke, he stepped forward, wrapped his fingers in a white cloth, and picked up an imitation ivory cigarette holder from the side of the desk.

I took the opportunity to look at the desk. The things on the desk were very simple, but they were very delicate. A gilded engraved inkwell, with two inkwells in red and blue, both lids were covered, and there were two pen tubes between the two Mengs, both empty, showing that these things were only used as decorations on the desk, and not for other purposes. A silver vase was also a genuine imported product, and there were no [unclear character] flowers in the vase. There were several books on the right hand, all of which were picture publications such as "Dance Star Little Notes" and "Movie Monthly." In the center, there was a thick glass lined with green velvet, and several photos of male and female stars were arranged under the glass. (15)

### The Women's Dormitory at Fudan University

— Xiao

The Fudan Women's Association and the Fudan Drama Society performed Yu Ling's play "Women's Dormitory" at the Youth Association on the 12th. The play has already been made into a very popular film.

Among the actors, the grandmother who played Tian Tai Xuan's mother was the best. It is said that this old lady is already sixty-two years old, and she is still so enthusiastic. It's really not easy. The few words of Mandarin she spoke were quite good. Her movements were natural, and she didn't look like she was acting at all. At first, I thought she was the nanny of someone from the star circle, no wonder she was so experienced!

Pei's Mandarin is very good, and her acting skills have improved greatly. Her pronunciation is louder than before, and her makeup is also better than before. In the first act, her posture of smoking and walking is very similar to Lan Lan, perhaps she learned it by imitating. Shi Dina's Liu Lizhu was very successful when eating Zhenjiang specialty products in the second act. In this tense second act, Hao Chuan's (played by Luo Huasheng) display of power and Pei Pei's contempt were also performed very well.

Yi De played Zhao Songyun. Her Mandarin was slightly worse, but her dull expression and sad tone captured the audience below the stage, and immediately made the whole place quiet. I saw glittering tears rolling in Yi De's eyes. It was rare to make the fake seem real.

The calm Huang Huifang is an old hand. Her few words of "so-so" were particularly vivid. An Lan made her debut and played Sha Xia competently, but her Mandarin was not very good. Ling Zi's Zhao Guanying was quite sincere when she cried at the end.

As for the male characters, Chen Ziqiang seems to be from Fujian or Guangdong. Although he tried his best to learn Mandarin when playing Ru Shi, he still seemed to have a Fujian-Guangdong accent, but it was already not very obvious. He had several fluent passages. Chen Cang's Qi Weide was very good. Lao Zhang's Niu Dawang was a little lacking in composure when he recalled things in the second act, but he did a good job when the husband and wife reunited at the end. I saw that Luo Huasheng's face was really flushed when he showed his power, which was good in itself.

The lighting was sometimes completely dark due to inexperience, so it should be more accurate. The back of a chair facing the stage in the third act was very clever. Because general arrangements are designed to have the actors' faces facing the audience, so that the audience can see the actors' expressions clearly, which is good in principle. But in reality, it would never be so coincidental. Therefore, a chair facing the stage is possible in reality. At the same time, when there are too many characters, it can increase the attention of the main characters, and other actors can also get a chance to breathe and rest while sitting on the chair. The composition is also unique. Therefore, I say this method is clever.

### About the "Um" Girl, Ann Sheridan

— Yong

Ann Sheridan is a well-known "Um" girl on the screen. Speaking of her acting skills, she has already left a deep impression in everyone's minds, so there is no need for the writer to introduce her again. So, now let's talk about some of her private life behind the screen. All the fans must be happy to hear it.

Diet

Ann Sheridan loves coffee so much that she can drink as many as ten cups at a time. As for food, her favorite is ham and grilled steak. As for beans, she says they are the most tasteless things. She is also very experienced in cooking, so she often invites friends to dine together at home.

Clothing

In terms of clothing, Ann Sheridan, like other stars, strives for sophistication and beauty. She has twenty or thirty evening dresses that she has never worn after they were made. She likes to wear men's-style trousers.

Sleep

Before going to bed every night, Ann Sheridan always has to lie on the bed, read ten or twenty pages of a book, and smoke a cigarette. This has become her habit, otherwise, she cannot fall asleep. In addition, there is another habit, that is, she must have two or three pillows to use.

Entertainment

Ann Sheridan's relaxation behind the screen, in terms of sports, is skating and swimming. In addition, she also likes to collect various flowers and fruit trees. She often uses the money she saves to buy government bonds, or she uses it to buy jewelry and other things. After buying them, she never wears them. She says, "I just like to buy them!"

Wishes

She has a wish that she hopes to realize sooner or later: the first is that she hopes that she can become a great actress like Bette Davis in the future. The second is to have a large pasture.

Superstition

It may be laughable to say, Ann Sheridan is also a person who worships superstition. If she puts a hat on the bed, or whispers in the dressing room, she believes that these two things will bring bad luck. On weekdays, she always wears an agate ring on her hand. According to her, this is a charm that represents good luck!

Ann Sheridan speaks Spanish fluently, which is a source of pride for her among the stars in Hollywood.

Marriage

Not long ago, there were often rumors that she was going to marry someone. On this issue, she made the following remarks. She said: "The man who is most suitable in my ideal should have an extraordinary ambition, and his personality should be somewhat humorous. It doesn't matter whether he is rich or poor, and as for his appearance, as long as he is not ugly, there is no need to be too handsome. When it comes to age, if his spirit and energy are like a twenty-one-year-old youth, then his real age can be between twenty-five and forty-five, and it doesn't matter. Finally, he must dance very well."

### The African Circus to Perform in Suzhou

The African Circus came to Shanghai at the invitation of Shunli Company to perform. It has been more than a month now. Yesterday, the reporter met the person in charge of the circus. According to him, the African Circus may stop performing in the next few days, but before stopping, they will perform a charity show for several days. The proceeds from the sale of tickets will be given to charitable organizations to be used to help refugees. In addition, it is said that after this break, they may go to Suzhou to perform, because recently someone from Suzhou came to Shanghai to contact the African Circus. If there are no other obstacles, it can proceed. (Xinggu)
