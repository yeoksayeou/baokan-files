### German Troops Cross the Somme River, Fiercely Attacking French Positions but Repelled, Tank Units Penetrating the Champagne Region Destroyed, Germans Claim Breakthroughs at Several Points in the Weygand Line

Paris - Military sources here say that the situation this morning was even more intense than before. The German army is attacking in three directions (one in the Amiens area, one in the Péronne area, and one along the Arleux Canal between the Aisne and Oise rivers). Their artillery is also heavily bombarding French positions in the Champagne region from the lower Somme River, seemingly to cover the army's advance. However, our positions are well-defended with anti-tank fortifications, which are proving effective, so the positions remain unshaken. On the evening of the 5th, many German tanks briefly broke through our lines, but because infantry units failed to follow up in time, they were ultimately destroyed by our forces. (Havas, June 6)

Paris - The enemy has concentrated a large number of tanks along the lower Somme River, attacking our positions. Our outposts there briefly repelled the enemy yesterday, but for strategic reasons, they were withdrawn voluntarily last night. (Havas, June 6)

Paris - Military sources here say that the Germans fiercely attacked the “Avenue de la Dame” region in the Arleux Canal basin yesterday. This morning, they brought in many cannons of various calibers and immediately opened fire with great intensity, seemingly to cover an infantry advance. In addition, they released a large number of smoke screens, causing the front lines to be obscured by thick smoke, making visibility poor. Their intent is both to cover the army's advance and to prevent French aircraft from reconnaissance. As for the air forces of both sides, they are extremely active. British and French aircraft engaged German planes in aerial combat yesterday and bombed German infantry and tank formations on the front lines. (Havas, June 6)

Paris - General Headquarters issued a communiqué tonight stating, "Since 4:00 AM today, the enemy has launched a new offensive in the areas of Amiens, Péronne, and the Arleux Canal basin, using tank units as spearheads to attack our positions. However, all attacks have been repelled. Our forces are holding their positions firmly and unmoved. In addition, our air force has been extremely active. A squadron of bombers flew to Munich and Ludwigshafen in Germany last night, bombing important factories, airfields, and railway stations. All targets were hit, and fires broke out in several places. Our aircraft also took the opportunity to conduct reconnaissance flights, obtaining important intelligence." (Havas, June 5)

Paris - Military sources here say that the Germans have been fiercely attacking our positions continuously since 4:00 AM this morning, ceasing only towards evening. The offensive was launched in three directions: one in the Amiens area, one in the Péronne area, and one along the Arleux Canal basin between the Aisne and Oise rivers. Elsewhere, fighting was less intense. In the Amiens and Péronne sector, the Germans hold two bridgeheads on the left bank of the Somme River, and using these as a base, they are fiercely attacking French positions under the cover of artillery, aircraft, and tanks. The attacks are becoming increasingly intense, but the French positions are protected by natural defenses and have overlapping lines of defense. Therefore, the German tanks are encountering strong resistance and are hindered by rivers and forests. Even if they break through the French positions, the infantry and supply units cannot follow up, and the tank units are unable to obtain supplies. As a result, they become isolated and vulnerable to French counterattacks. The situation today is exactly like that. Although German tank units have broken through French positions in some places, the French line as a whole remains intact. The general situation can be considered satisfactory. (Havas, June 5)

Paris - Last night, French officials stated that the French army is currently firmly resisting extremely intense enemy attacks, and it may be necessary to abandon some unimportant positions. The Germans, with particularly strong forces, are attacking the French left flank on the Somme River, having built three bridges across the Somme to reach the south bank. (Reuters, June 6)

Paris - At dawn this morning, as the battle of the Somme River resumed, French forces, for strategic reasons, withdrew slightly from the line from the coast to Amiens, but continued to hold other unbreached positions. The Germans, in an attempt to turn towards Le Havre and the lower Seine River, are applying extremely heavy pressure on the extreme right of the Weygand line. (United Press, June 6)

### German War Report

Berlin - The German High Command announced last night that our army launched a battle inspection this morning, attacking French forces, crossing the Somme River, and breaking through the so-called "Weygand Line" at several points. (Haitong Press, June 6)

Berlin - Authoritative sources here say that German troops will enter Paris within a week. Two French counterattacks have been repelled by German forces. At 8:00 PM last night, German forces advanced on a "very broad front" between the English Channel and the Maginot Line, with two objectives: "First, to completely cut off communications between Britain and France. Second, to create a new base of operations for invading Britain." It is widely believed that the Germans will advance southwest along the coast from the Somme River to Le Havre, while another force near Soissons will advance directly towards Paris. This is a variation of the Schlieffen Plan. (United Press, June 6)

Berlin - German military experts, commenting to a reporter from the Haitong News Agency on the German High Command's war report, said, "One day after our troops occupied Dunkirk, the number of French soldiers captured was as high as 40,000, including three generals. However, no British soldiers were captured. Our army has established a defensive line there and begun to advance forward. In the four weeks after our army launched an offensive on the Western Front, it annihilated the British Expeditionary Force, driving the remnants off the continent. The French army has now fallen into a position of fighting alone. The previous day's war report stated that our Junkers bombers bombed troops concentrated south of Abbeville, which is another example of destroying enemy forces. The bombing of the port of Le Havre by German aircraft can be said to be a major blow to the French northern coast, as this port is extremely important to the French economy, and most of France's imported oil enters through this port." (Haitong Press, June 6)

Berlin - According to news received here, enemy tanks attacked near Abbeville yesterday. German anti-aircraft gun units and defending troops coordinated to repel the attack, with seven tanks destroyed by anti-aircraft shells. (Haitong Press, June 6)

Berlin - Judging from the situation here last night, the German plan is to defeat France first before launching a final major invasion of Britain. Nazi sources claim that if this offensive compels France to surrender, removing it from the war, then Germany can concentrate its forces to attack Britain, without having to worry about its rear. Otherwise, if Germany immediately attacks Britain, it will disperse its military strength and risk being attacked on two fronts. (United Press, June 6) ...waiting next to the direct-fire guns, waiting for the tanks to approach, and then opening fire fiercely at close range. The German troops were trapped in a web of fire, and French machine gunners forced German dispatch riders, motorized vehicle soldiers, and mechanized infantry to stop before their rain of bullets. Several tanks continued to move forward without assistance, and several even reached the French rear, where they were surrounded and destroyed by French forces. A spokesman firmly stated that this was only the beginning of the decisive battle that the German side hoped for, so more intense fighting would be seen on both flanks sooner or later. At dawn today, countless German tanks drove to the lower reaches of the Somme River, and major offensives would probably be launched there today. On the other flank, located to the right of Élet and the “Avenue de la Dame,” German artillery had been bombarding relentlessly, which was clearly a prelude to a new major offensive. When French aircraft raided last night, they shot down seven German aircraft in Normandy and approximately three more in the central region. According to responsible sources in London, the tactics of this German offensive are very similar to those used in Belgium and northern France previously. They are now trying to find a weak point in the French line, and once found, they will pour all their strength into the breach. The French side now admits that the Germans have made progress in several places, but it should be noted that the French defenses are very deep, and the German progress cannot be described as a breakthrough. However, there is still no definitive news about this major battle. The Germans are attacking in the Amiens area, especially near Péronne, and in the Soissons area, but the Germans have not yet reached Soissons. Armored vehicles have been reported to have appeared in the above areas. (Reuters, June 6)

French Army Establishes New Defense Line Along the Two Rivers Under Severe Circumstances

French Front - After the German army launched a powerful offensive yesterday with the intention of occupying Paris, the reporter went to inspect the Somme and Aisne fronts and found that the French army was doing its best to rally in a hurry to cope with this battle. The current French defense line is located in the area south of these two river basins, from the coast to the upper reaches of the Aisne River. The French army stationed on this defense line is the one that has been reorganized after withdrawing from Belgium.

French Army Adopts New Defense Strategy to Vigorously Block German Tank Offensives

Paris - Today, the authorities acknowledged that the German tank units advancing towards the French capital have broken through the Somme River line, but denied that the tank units have the effectiveness of an "axe." It is said that the German armored monsters have been surrounded by a new defense strategy and stopped on the Amiens to Laon line. It is also heard that the French army has abandoned the theory of fixed fortifications, such as building the Maginot Line, and is now concentrating its defensive forces to repel the German tank offensives. Well-informed sources said that the so-called new defense strategy is to deploy armored self-propelled direct-fire guns at many key points. According to military experts' estimates, the German offensive this time has mobilized 45 divisions, with 750,000 soldiers, 1,000 dive bombers, 2,250 tanks, and 15,000 motorized vehicles. According to eyewitnesses, dive bombers are equipped with sirens. When they descend rapidly from thousands of feet to drop bombs, the shrill whistling sound is accompanied by a rain of machine-gun bullets. They release powerful bombs when they are hundreds of feet above the ground and then ascend quickly. (International News Service, June 6)

London - A French military spokesman in Paris declared today that the battle has actually developed along the entire line from the coast to the Aisne River, ceasing only at nightfall. The support points held by the French army, after being hit by German tanks, remained unmoved. The enemy tanks were forced to stop, and many tank traps are waiting for them in front. The French army is holding villages and plains, obstacles planted in the fields, and low forests on both sides of ravines or woods. This defense line should be called the (1) Somme-Aisne Line. The army in the Aisne River section constitutes the right wing of the resistance army. Two weeks ago, there was no such thing as the Aisne Line. Therefore, the French army that had not entered Belgium originally garrisoned along the Belgian border. Because the Sedan-Charleville-Mezières line was captured by the combined forces of the German army and air force, it became necessary to build a new defense line at any cost. The solution to this problem was actually impossible for the French High Command, because the French army had to do its best to stop the German advance. The result of stopping the German advance, according to French Premier Reynaud, was that the 9th Army was completely disorganized. In his speech, Reynaud acknowledged that the disorganization of this army was an unfortunate fact. In order to contain the German army and rebuild the defense line, French tank units were immediately ordered to advance, regardless of any sacrifice, and to resist the German mechanized forces vigorously. With a small number of tanks (in some battles, the number of German tanks was ten times greater than that of French tanks), they engaged with the well-equipped German tanks. French mechanized units suffered considerable losses in some areas, but fortunately, the German [advance] was stopped at that time. While French tanks were fighting hard to resist the enemy, the French High Command ordered several French divisions to occupy the Aisne and Ardennes Canal Line. When the commanders of each division and regiment received the orders, they did not know how far the German [penetration] south of Sedan, Charleville, and Mezières was. French commanders occupied the line after receiving rapid orders, resisting the unknown enemy at great sacrifice. According to a certain officer who served in the American Expeditionary Force in the last European war, his troops arrived here four hours after receiving the deployment order. Although the French army has been subjected to fierce German attacks, its morale is still extremely high. The soldiers who spoke with the reporter all agreed that the German army would no longer be able to intimidate them with their tanks and aircraft. (United Press, June 6)

### Allied Forces in Norway Pursue German Troops

Stockholm, Sweden - Aftonbladet's report from the Lappland border states that the Allied forces have advanced about ten miles from Narvik along the railway transporting iron ore towards the Swedish border and reached Sildvik. The retreating German troops are holding the trenches there. The railway line is being bombarded by military installations and artillery units stationed in the highlands of Narvik, while the Allied forces are pressing towards Bjørnfjell. (Reuters)

Narvik - A Havas news agency reporter stationed on the northern front in Norway recently reported that after the Allied forces recaptured the port of Narvik the day before yesterday, French troops advanced eastwards along the railway in the Sildvik region, 17 kilometers east of the port, clearing out the remaining enemy forces. A total of more than one hundred German soldiers were captured today. (Havas, June 6)

Editorial

### The United States Bans Military Supplies to Japan

The United States has a firm policy towards the Far East, and it is able to maintain a dignified style in implementing its policy; it has never been harsh or threatening, nor has it ever drawn its sword or brandished its spear, but it acts in various ways without yielding. This is truly a characteristic of American diplomacy. Recently, there have been new developments that are said to be not directed at Japan, but judging from past events, the nature of the sanctions is clearly visible; they are especially moderate and strong, probably waiting for the aggressor to realize his mistakes and repent in a not too embarrassing manner. In the past, on December 31, 1938, the United States sent a note to Japan, expressing its determination to maintain the Nine-Power Treaty and the Open Door Policy in China, without initially saying that it would follow up with action. On July 26, 1939, it announced the abrogation of the U.S.-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation, citing changes in the times and environment as the reason, without explicitly stating that this was the beginning of sanctions. On October 19, Ambassador Grew, stationed in Japan, conveyed the sentiment of American public opinion towards Japan in Tokyo in the form of a speech, which was earnest and clear, gentle without showing anger or resentment, and avoided attacking and denouncing. In January of this year, it indicated its refusal to continue negotiations on renewing the commercial treaty, and on the 26th, it declared the expiration of the treaty as scheduled. In March and April, it mobilized a large naval and air force and conducted an unprecedented exercise in the central Pacific, and after the event, it explicitly ordered them to remain stationed in Hawaii; it said that it was for self-defense and vigilance, not for demonstration. Furthermore, it has repeatedly loaned large sums of money to China for more than two years. Although the Japanese also frankly admitted the seriousness of the meaning of all these measures, the United States handled them lightly, as if nothing had happened. Until yesterday, there were two more things: first, a complete ban on the export of national defense military supplies; second, the planning and establishment of a military base in Alaska. Alaska is a peninsula in northwestern North America, close to the Soviet Union and confronting Japan, and is the closest American territory to mainland Japan. According to the U.S. Army authorities' explanation: The Soviet Union has fortifications in the Far East, less than 100 miles from U.S. territory; the Soviet Union intends to prevent Japan's invasion of Siberia, but who knows if there will ever be a day when it will use it to deal with the United States, so the United States should have something to counter it. The statement is very clever, and those who are knowledgeable must be able to see whether the United States' sudden rush to catch up is really for defending against Russia in the future or for dealing with Japan today? Regarding the ban on the export of national defense military supplies, according to the U.S. State Department's explanation: This measure is not included in the scope of the moral embargo against Japan, and it is only because of the needs of the U.S. national defense that exports are prohibited. It is widely rumored that although the U.S. embargo measures are said to treat all countries equally, separate measures will be made for Britain, France, and China. Regardless of the truth of the rumors, no matter how much the degree of accommodation, it is obvious that the most affected in practice is Japan. Yesterday, the North China Daily News telegraphed from Tokyo: "The news that the United States is about to ban the export of various major items to other countries has greatly shocked Japan again. It is felt here that Japan is the one most seriously affected by this step; although the United States has stated that it is prohibiting exports for its own needs, Japan still suspects that the United States will give preferential treatment to countries it sympathizes with, while Japan will be adversely affected by these new regulations. Sources well-informed in the Japanese army say that if the Western countries are determined to cut off Japan's main necessities, then Japan will naturally be forced to advance south." In that case, we say that the United States has a firm policy towards the Far East, and it implements it in a dignified manner in various ways, and we confidently believe that we are not being untruthful.

Telegraphic news is vague and lacks details. What the United States has now prohibited from exporting is rumored to be machinery, military supplies, or certain major items. The details and scope of the ban are currently unknown. However, judging from the severity of the Japanese reaction today, and considering the great extent to which Japan has historically relied on American material resources, it is not difficult to imagine the impact of the American ban on Japan's aggression and what kind of meaning it will have. From a general trade perspective, from 1934 to 1938, a total of five years, Japan's total exports to the United States amounted to 2.6 billion yen, and imports from the United States amounted to about 4.5 billion yen, with Japan's import surplus reaching a huge 1.9 billion yen. On the one hand, Japan can be regarded as a major customer of the United States, but on the other hand, it can be seen that Japan's need for American goods is great, and the amount of material support that the United States provides to Japan is huge. Judging from the trade commodities between the United States and Japan: apart from raw silk, which is a major item in Japanese exports to the United States, there are also canned foods, pottery, porcelain, fabrics, toys, tea, and chrysanthemums. All of these are not indispensable to the lives of the American people, nor are they necessarily sourced from Japan; however, the vast majority of what Japan trades with the United States consists of military supplies. Taking the statistics for 1937 as an example, the import of American cotton into Japan was a strong 61 million U.S. dollars, which was the largest item; in addition, scrap iron was worth more than 37 million U.S. dollars, copper was slightly less than 18 million U.S. dollars, pig iron was slightly less than 10 million U.S. dollars, steel ingots were more than 8.7 million U.S. dollars, gasoline was more than 7 million U.S. dollars, and steel plates were more than 5.7 million U.S. dollars. Sheet steel was more than 4.4 million U.S. dollars, all of which are raw materials for the artillery fire used to bomb China. Comparing this amount with the total amount of military supplies imported by Japan from various countries, it accounts for 75% to 85% of the total. The proportion of American support to Japan can be seen. Only because of this proportion, it is understandable that Japan is "greatly shocked" upon hearing the American ban, it is reasonable, and the situation is inevitable. They then sullenly said, I will have no choice but to advance south. Japan intends to advance south, as this newspaper discussed yesterday, and it does not stem from the American ban; and the United States naturally adheres to its firm policy and will not abandon its ban because of Japan's threat of advancing south; what we want to wait and see is how other parties in the Pacific will follow the United States and collectively prohibit the export of military supplies, shortening the scourge of aggression, since the aggression and atrocities in the Far East have not only been suffered by China, but the resistance war has allowed other parties in the Pacific to gain temporary peace.

### Mediterranean Situation Increasingly Urgent: Italy Declares "Danger" Zone, Plants Mines in Territorial Waters of Mainland and Colonies, Prepares to Implement Blackouts to Prevent Air Raids

Rome – The Italian government announced last night that mines have been laid in the territorial waters of Italy, Albania, and its colonies, creating a "danger" zone within twelve nautical miles of the aforementioned areas. This declaration coincides with the escalating crisis in the Mediterranean. Italy has begun preparing its people for war. Italian newspapers continue to attack the Allied powers for persecuting Italians. Premier Mussolini, yesterday, during the celebration of the 126th anniversary of the Italian cavalry, received General Moro, commander of the cavalry, and senior generals, giving them orders concerning the possibility of Italy joining the European war. To implement blackouts, Italian authorities have ordered all residents, shop owners, and hotel owners to prepare everything to prevent light from escaping during air raids. All vehicles must install low-intensity headlights. Violators will be subject to three months imprisonment and a two thousand lira (Italian currency) fine. Meanwhile, the official Italian Stefani News Agency published news from Beijing, stating that it received a report from the Italian consulate in Charleroi that, before the German occupation of Belgium, French officers had executed seven Italians in Vieu and Cabanal for espionage. "Is this the only crime of France in persecuting Italians in Belgium?" (United Press, 6th)

Rome – The government has just issued a communiqué stating, "The sea within twelve miles of the coast of mainland Italy and its overseas territories will henceforth be a dangerous navigation area. All ships wishing to enter ports within this area must obtain permission and instructions from Italian consular or military authorities. Those already en route to these ports must promptly notify the port authorities of their location, the date, and time of entering the dangerous area so that pilots can be dispatched. Failure to comply with these measures will result in assuming all risks." In addition, the government issued a communiqué stating that, effective immediately, the sound of a siren will be used as an air raid warning. Factories are generally prohibited from using them at other times. (Havas, 6th)

Rome – It is reported that Mussolini will deliver a speech to the nation from the balcony of the Palazzo Venezia tonight. All evening newspapers featured news of the new German offensive on the front page with large headlines. The Rome Mail stated that the French army could not win, while the Fascist newspaper ridiculed the Maginot Line. (Reuters, 6th)

Rome – There are no political indications today regarding Italy's possible entry into the war. Rumors that Mussolini would deliver an important speech tonight could not be confirmed. According to political figures, Italian authorities may need to delay the final decision for several days. However, this afternoon, several squadrons of aircraft, each with eight or ten planes, flew low over the city, likely to stimulate the people and prepare them psychologically. By evening, blackout regulations were more strictly enforced, with most streets only lit by dim green lights. (Havas, 6th)

Paris – Observers here are still unclear about the date and manner of Italy's entry into the war. It is generally believed that Italy will join the war when the current German offensive reaches its peak. This is after France notified Italy that it was prepared to negotiate, but Italy has not yet responded. Therefore, if Italy does enter the war, it will have no valid excuse, regardless of what pretext it uses. Italian newspapers are currently making efforts to spread propaganda, pointing to difficulties between Turkey and Greece, but both Turkey and Greece have denied this. In addition, German propaganda has claimed that Swiss aircraft pursued German aircraft in French airspace, which is similar to the situation before Germany invaded Belgium and the Netherlands. (Havas, 5th)

Rome – Yesterday, well-informed Italian sources claimed that reports that former French Premier Laval is currently residing here were rumors. (Reuter, 6th)

### U.S. President and Italian Premier Continue to Exchange Views, Advising Against Entanglement in European War: Rumors of Italy Willing to Mediate European Situation with Conditions

Washington – The White House announced last night that President Roosevelt is continuing to exchange documents with Premier Mussolini, with the initial aim of avoiding the expansion of the European war. The White House and the State Department yesterday again refused to disclose any content of this exchange. No indication was given as to the extent to which the United States is considering Italy's demands on the Allies to help maintain peace in Southern Europe. The Italian government's lack of action regarding entering the war on Tuesday led some here to believe that there is a possibility of Italy not directly entering the war. Well-informed sources stated that Italy did not enter the war on Tuesday, which means that, at a minimum, Washington and Rome still have time to exchange views. It is understood that this exchange of documents has also extended to other capitals. There have been various reports published here about the documents between President Roosevelt and Premier Mussolini, but none have been officially confirmed. Well-informed circles stated that outside reports about the U.S.-Italy talks are clearly the result of unofficial observations by second-rate news outlets. The information in these reports did not come from the White House. (United Press, 6th)

Washington – Well-informed sources here generally believe that President Roosevelt is continuing to exchange views with the Italian government authorities, seeking to maintain the country's non-belligerent status. However, it is reported that Mussolini has expressed a willingness to mediate the current European war, but only on the condition that France cede certain territories in its mainland and African colonies to Italy. According to diplomatic figures, President Roosevelt has likely advised Mussolini that if Italy participates in the war, 250 million people living in countries along the Mediterranean coast will be drawn into the vortex, and American public opinion will react strongly. In the eyes of the American people, Mussolini's position will automatically become the same as Hitler's. In addition, although the President did not explicitly tell him that the United States would intervene after Italy entered the war, he stated that American anxiety is growing and public opinion is becoming increasingly hostile toward dictatorial countries, making it highly likely. Moreover, since Britain and France have recently reaffirmed their determination to fight to the end, President Roosevelt can rely on this determination to inform Mussolini that the war will definitely be protracted. Regarding this matter, sources close to the White House recently mentioned that the remarks made by Democratic Senator Pepper are worthy of attention. Pepper said, "I firmly believe that President Roosevelt will definitely express something clearly to Premier Mussolini, with no possibility of misunderstanding. I believe that if Premier Mussolini involves Italy in the war's vortex, he will suffer a whiplash from the United States, like a slave crawling into a dungeon, with eternal regret for the rest of his life." White House officials stated that President Roosevelt did not use such strong language when communicating with Premier Mussolini, but they said that Pepper's remarks were made after a visit to the President. In short, the President's efforts have delayed the date of Italy's entry into the war. If Italy does enter the war after all, the President can make Italy bear the responsibility for expanding the war, making this public to national and world opinion. (Havas, 6th)

### British and French Air Forces Penetrate Deep into German Territory, Bombing Military Targets

Paris – An Air Ministry communiqué stated that yesterday our air force was extremely active. French bomber squadrons flew to Mannheim, Ulm, Ludwigshafen, and Munich, bombing various military targets. A factory in Badische Anilin und Soda Fabrik was bombed, and a fire broke out, which was visible far from the French border. In the evening, French bombers again heavily bombed important targets in Saint-Quentin, Péronne, and Cambrai. Stations and roads were bombed, and transportation was completely disrupted. German troops resting in these areas were also bombed. French aircraft dropped six tons of bombs. Since the German offensive, intense air battles have broken out. French fighters have been very effective in assisting the army. French infantry and tanks advance together with air support. In addition to intercepting enemy transportation lines, French aircraft have also inflicted heavy damage on enemy motorized units. A large number of enemy aircraft were shot down by our forces. Detailed information cannot be released at this time. (Reuters, 6th)

London – The Air Ministry announced that British medium bombers heavily bombed enemy transportation lines to the Somme battlefield yesterday. British fighters operating from France maintained offensive patrols throughout the day, destroying six enemy aircraft. One British aircraft was lost. British bombers attacked enemy troop concentrations last night and disrupted enemy activities in the rear. Another group of British bombers bombed railway junctions and troop assembly areas west of the Ruhr and military targets inside Germany. Two British aircraft are missing. British aircraft also attacked oil depots in Belgium. This morning, when British aircraft bombed Ghent, they not only hit the oil depots with heavy bombs, but also descended from high altitudes using the light from the burning gasoline to spread the fire further with incendiary bombs. (Reuters, 6th)

### French Cabinet Reshuffle: Foreign Minister and Minister of National Defense Positions Concurrently Held by Premier Reynaud

Paris Urgent Dispatch – The cabinet held a meeting at 11:03 PM tonight. Afterwards, Premier Reynaud submitted his cabinet's resignation to President Lebrun. It is likely that the President will entrust Reynaud with forming a new cabinet. (Havas, 6th)

Paris – Reynaud's new cabinet has just been announced. The titles of all cabinet members are as follows:

The new cabinet member in charge of the Information Department, Prouvost, is the manager of the Paris Evening News. The Minister of Finance, Bouthillier, was previously the Secretary-General of the Ministry of Finance. The Undersecretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Baudouin, is the General Manager of Banque de l'Indochine. He previously served as the Director of the Cabinet's War Council Office. The remaining cabinet members have retained their positions. (Havas, 6th)

### Major Battle Imminent on West Bank of Han River: Japanese Troops Crossing River Attempt to Attack Yichang, China Has Thorough Preparations in Place

Chongqing – A Chinese military spokesman announced that a major battle is expected to occur on the west bank of the Han River soon. It is estimated that one-third of the Japanese troops attacking Yichang have crossed the Han River. 15,000 Japanese troops have crossed the river east of Shashi, and a total of 30,000 troops are currently crossing the river. Chinese commanders have made thorough preparations to deal with the Japanese attack on Yichang. (Reuters, 6th)

Chongqing – According to Chinese sources, the Japanese troops in Hankou clearly intend to seize Yichang. Japanese troops who arrived in Xiangyang on the west bank of the Han River on June 1 are reportedly moving southwest towards Nanzhang, forming the northern force attacking Yichang. Further south, Japanese troops gathered on the east bank of the Han River between Zhongxiang and Qianjiang are reportedly crossing the river in several places near Shayang, northeast of Shashi, yesterday under the cover of artillery fire and aircraft, in order to advance towards Yichang along the Hanyi Highway and the north bank of the Yangtze River. (Reuters, 6th)

Chongqing – By dusk on June 4, the major battle on the border of Henan and Hubei provinces had concluded with a glorious Chinese victory. To cover up their disastrous defeat, the Japanese are again crossing the river at various points upstream and downstream of the Xiang River. Currently, the Japanese crossing plan has encountered unexpected setbacks at various crossing points and is in a difficult situation. The evolution of the situation has gradually progressed to the eve of a major battle on the west bank of the Xiang River. Recently, a certain authoritative military observer discussed the future of the war, stating that the Japanese defeat on the east bank of the Xiang River is a foregone conclusion, and the fate of launching a major battle on the west bank of the Xiang River will inevitably be the same, because China has made full preparations in advance and can use agile and proactive strategies to control the situation. Regarding the general results of the major battle on the border of Henan and Hubei provinces and the recent situation of the battle on the west bank of the Xiang River, a certain military spokesperson told the Central News Agency reporter as follows: By June 1, most of the remaining Japanese troops were concentrated in Zhaoyang, and the Chinese troops from various directions also calmly and actively pressured and besieged Zhaoyang. By noon on the 2nd, the Chinese forces entered the city, and fierce street battles broke out immediately. The Japanese troops fled in several directions. The Chinese forces completely recovered Zhaoyang and fiercely intercepted and blocked the Japanese troops in the Wujiaji area of the Xianghua Road. On the 3rd, the Chinese forces launched a fierce battle against the retreating Japanese troops near Tangxian Town and Zhangjiaji, completely defeating the Japanese troops in one fell swoop. The remaining Japanese troops fled towards the Dahong Mountains. The Chinese elite forces in the Dahong Mountains carried out a large-scale mop-up operation against the Japanese troops. As a result, most of the Japanese troops were annihilated, and a small number fled towards Zhongxian, Jingshan, and Anlu. The major battle on the border of Henan and Hubei provinces has completely ended. The current situation is that, except for the key points on the highway north of Suixian, which have been recovered by the Chinese forces, other areas have completely returned to the state before April 30. The Japanese troops have suffered this disastrous defeat, and it is judged that they will soon launch another large-scale operation in an attempt to cover up their defeat. As expected, from the late night of May 31, the Japanese troops crossed the river at Wangjiaji and Oujiamiao between Xiangyang and Yicheng, with a number of about 12,000 people. After crossing the river, they attacked in three directions: one towards Yicheng, one towards Nanzhang, and the main force of the third towards Xiangyang in the north. On June 1, the Japanese troops once charged into Xiangyang. The Chinese troops fought bravely and counterattacked. By the morning of the 3rd, they defeated the Japanese troops and recovered Xiangyang. The Japanese troops attacking Yicheng had very weak combat power and made no progress. The Japanese troops near Nanzhang were defeated by the Chinese forces in one fell swoop and retreated towards Wu'an Weir. The Chinese forces fiercely pursued them, and the Japanese troops continued to flee southeast. In addition, there were Japanese troops crossing the river in the lower reaches of the Xiang River. From 11:00 PM on June 4, the Japanese troops on the front of the Hanyi Highway began to forcibly cross the Han River in several directions, one north of Luohan Temple (north of Shayang), one at Sigang, and one near Qianjiang. By dawn today, more than 10,000 Japanese troops had reached the west bank of the Xiang River. The Chinese troops along the river used intense firepower to inflict heavy damage on the Japanese troops while they were crossing the river. The Japanese troops suffered serious difficulties. As of now, there are still small groups continuing to cross the river. In summary, the number of Japanese troops who have crossed the river north of Yicheng and in this area is about 20,000. It is expected that a second major battle will unfold in a few days. The Chinese army has an early and clear judgement and full preparation. The result of this battle, the Japanese side will inevitably suffer another defeat, can be asserted. (6th Dispatch)

Chongqing – A Chinese military spokesman stated that one of the most important battles of the Sino-Japanese War will occur this week between Yichang and the west bank of the Han River in central Hubei. About 30,000 Japanese troops have crossed the Han River and are approaching Xiangyang. Another 15,000 Japanese troops have approached Shayang and Qianjiang in the lower reaches of the Han River. The Chinese army recaptured Xiangyang on June 3. Although the Japanese army is launching a fierce counterattack, the Chinese army is still firmly defending the city. The Japanese side has now dispatched more than 30,000 troops to fight in the area between Yichang and Xiangyang, and there are about 20,000 reserve troops in the Hanyi Highway area, preparing to supplement the attack on the west bank of the Han River. This move by the Japanese is clearly to obtain Yichang, but the defense of the city is very strong. It will be difficult for the Japanese to penetrate deeply. The Chinese army has been building fortresses in the area for two years. The city is now like an impenetrable wall of iron. It is feared that the main battle next week will not be in Xiangyang but near Yichang. (United Press, 6th)

### US Government Uses Huge Sums to Build Strong Navy - Daily Expenditure of 2 Million Gold Dollars - Another Battleship to be Launched This Summer

Washington. The U.S. government is spending approximately 26 million U.S. dollars daily to build the world's strongest navy. By 1941, the government's daily construction expenditure will reach 2 million U.S. dollars. According to the Navy Department's estimates, the average daily expenditure for machinery and construction is 20 million U.S. dollars, while armaments, armor, and munitions cost 6.5 million U.S. dollars monthly. This monthly expenditure will soon increase to 24.5 million U.S. dollars and 7.083 million U.S. dollars. This expenditure will increase further when the additional shipbuilding facilities approved by Congress are completed. By the end of 1939, the United States had eighty warships under construction in government and private shipyards, including eight battleships, two aircraft carriers, thirty-three destroyers, sixteen submarines, and numerous other small vessels. These expenses only cover the cost of new ship construction and do not include the expenses for naval bases and personnel. According to Navy Secretary Edison's recent announcement to Congress, government shipyards employ 67,000 civilians. Among the battleships under construction, the 35,000-ton "North Carolina," costing 65 million U.S. dollars per ship, will be launched this summer. Another 35,000-ton "Washington" was launched last week. Construction of battleships began in 1937. According to Edison, these battleships will equal or exceed the power of other warships of "the same type." Edison claimed that if these warships were planned today, their designs would undergo significant changes. Although shipbuilding expenses have increased sharply in recent years, future shipbuilding expenditures will not be relaxed. Naval officials feel that the United States can no longer rely on the assistance of other countries and must possess a fleet capable of resisting any enemy or coalition of enemies. Since the end of the Soviet-Finnish War and the weakened position of the Allied powers, "the naval community feels that the nation's self-reliance in defense is more necessary than before. They feel that Britain's great fleet, once regarded as America's guard dog and a supplement to American strength in the Atlantic, must now remain very close to Britain."

### United States Expands Monroe Doctrine - Foreign Affairs Committees of Both Houses Pass Important Declaration

Washington. The Foreign Affairs Committees of both the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives yesterday unanimously agreed to separately vote to pass a new and historic declaration of American foreign policy.

This declaration is, in effect, a restatement of the meaning of the Monroe Doctrine and expands the scope of the Monroe Doctrine. This declaration treats British-held Canada and the various Latin American republics equally, without distinction. All lands within the New World are included in this declaration. The Foreign Affairs Committees of both houses, in passing this declaration, stated that Congress agrees with President Roosevelt's recent statements regarding the Western Hemisphere, believing that President Roosevelt's previous views were an expansion of the Monroe Doctrine. This declaration will now be submitted to the Senate and House of Representatives separately for final passage. Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, predicted that the declaration would be passed by both houses within a few days, and stated that this decision is a liberation of American national policy, warning all powerful nations attempting to control the territories in the Western Hemisphere held by Britain, France, Denmark, and the Netherlands.

Dublin. The National Defense Forces Bill has passed its second reading in the South Irish Parliament. Fine Gael party deputy leader Dillon delivered a speech stating that if Ireland is invaded, it will resist to the end. If Ireland were to succumb to the invasion of a belligerent nation, it would inevitably provoke resistance from other powers, and the entire nation would inevitably be transformed into a battlefield of bloodshed.

### Churchill Reports on the War Situation (Conclusion) - National Defense Forces Strong and Robust

However, while we are gratified by the safe escape of the great army, and those who love them should feel comforted after this painful period, we cannot ignore the recent events in France and Belgium. The consequences of these events, in addition to the aforementioned, have also caused us to lose a large part of the fortified lines on which our confidence rested, and many valuable mining areas and factories have fallen into enemy hands. We often hear that Hitler has a plan to invade the British Isles. This plan has been considered frequently in the past. The current military strength of this island is stronger than at any time during this or the last war. Therefore, the issue of domestic defense against invasion has, of course, undergone a significant change. However, we must not be complacent because we are capable of defense. We still have obligations to the Allied powers. Therefore, we must reorganize the Central Expeditionary Force, and it will still be led by General Gort. All of this must be done in succession. However, in the meantime, we must place the defense of the British Isles in an extremely secure position, so that it can be defended with the fewest possible troops, and we can achieve the greatest possible potential offensive effort. We are currently working on this.

If the House wishes to discuss this issue (cheers), it is appropriate to hold a secret session to discuss it. This is not because the government must reveal the secrets of the army and navy, but because it wishes to allow our discussions to be free, without having to worry about the enemy reading them the next day, thus preventing us from expressing ourselves fully. The government can benefit from the opinions expressed by the various parties in the House.

### Strict Prevention of Espionage Activities

We now feel that we should implement an increasingly strict plan, not only to deal with enemy aliens and other foreigners whose actions are suspicious, but also to deal with British citizens who could be disruptive if the war extends to Britain. (Cheers) I know that many people will be affected by the government's orders. These people are ardent enemies of Nazi Germany, but I cannot express enough apologies to them, because in the current situation, we do not have time to make the detailed distinctions we would like to make. If the Germans attempt to land paratroopers in Britain, causing fierce fighting, then it is better for these unfortunate people, for their own sake and for the sake of others, to leave the war zone. There is another type of person for whom I have no sympathy. Parliament has given us powerful means to stop the activities of the "Fifth Column." We will use this power without hesitation. Everything will be supervised and corrected by the House until we are satisfied that we have eradicated the harmful elements mixed in among the masses, and even more than satisfied.

### Lesson from Napoleon's Failure

Returning to the issue of the invasion of Britain, I dare say that in all the long centuries, there has never been a time when we could boast of being able to resist invasion, nor has there ever been an absolute guarantee against serious air raids to the people as there is today. In the Napoleonic era, a great wind arose, seemingly about to blow his troop transports across the Channel. Today, the same wind, or even worse, is in the path of fleets tasked with maintaining a blockade. Opportunities arise frequently. This is an opportunity to create illusions that mislead many tyrants on the Continent.

Lately, hearsay has frequently reached our ears, asserting that the enemy will definitely use novel methods to attack. Having seen the source of the evil and the ingenuity of aggression displayed by the enemy, we must, of course, prepare to respond to various novel tactics and all kinds of barbaric and treacherous movements. I do not think it should be dismissed as fantasy, believing it should not be given consideration. We must not fix our eyes on it and pay close attention. However, we should never forget the firm protection of the sea, and the protection of air power, if used properly, is also very reliable.

### Hope Everyone Will Fulfill Their Duty

I firmly believe that if the people can fulfill their responsibilities, not relax in the slightest, and make the best arrangements they are currently making, then we can once again prove that we have the power to defend our island nation and escape the storms of war. Our existence can be forever free from the threat of tyranny, and if necessary, we will do so for years. If necessary, we will accomplish this alone. (Cheers) This is what we are striving to do today. This is the determination of the British government, and everyone in the government feels the same. This is the will of Parliament and the nation. After the Prime Minister finished speaking, Smith rose to speak on behalf of the Labour Party. He was very pleased to hear that the Prime Minister had informed the nation in the simplest of terms what efforts they would be asked to make. Following this, Labour MP Ellen Wilkinson asked the Prime Minister to guarantee an early opportunity to hold a secret debate. The Prime Minister replied, "I understand that next Tuesday may be convenient." (Reuters dispatch, 5th)

### A "Neutral" Voice at the Beginning of the European War (1)

— Uncle Di

Introduction

In early September of last year, Britain, France, and Poland officially went to war with Germany.

At the time, I was in London. Because I was thinking about the terrible destructiveness of modern warfare, I was worried all day long. On the other hand, because I had such a good opportunity to witness this major event in human history, I was excited all day long. The subject I was studying happened to be "International Relations." Even though I was suffering from quite severe asthma, I was still going everywhere from morning till night. I went to the university for research, to the British Museum for reference materials, to professors, classmates, and friends, to Parliament to listen to speeches and debates, to various research conferences, and I paid attention to the discussions of all kinds of people in the streets and alleys... I was reading, observing, listening, discussing, and thinking... In the evening—sometimes late at night—I returned wearily to my residence, brewed a pot of strong coffee, and facing a lonely electric light that seemed to be shining extraordinarily brightly, I took notes of what I had gained that day, piece by piece. Occasionally, I would stroke my slightly numb and swollen legs, but now, looking back, it seems that I didn't feel much emotion at the time, at most just a deep breath; then I would bury my head again and continue with my notes. However, now, when I turn over my notes from that time, what comes to mind are two other things I encountered several times.

One thing:

When I was concentrating on taking notes, I was startled many times by a gentle knock on the door.

"Who's there?"

"Excuse me, Mr. X, your 'Blinder'..." This was the voice of the landlady, or sometimes her daughter's voice.

"Ah! I'm very sorry!" I had forgotten to close the "Blinder," which had just been installed to prevent wartime air raids. I hurriedly ran over to close it, apologizing at the same time.

"Excuse my interruption. Good night!"

"Excuse my negligence. Good night!" Hearing the sound of footsteps going down the stairs, I realized that the landlady got up several times a night to inspect whether the lights in each room were properly covered. At times like these, I often felt a sense of unease, which made me stop writing and stare blankly for several minutes.

Another thing:

At the entrance of the graduate school, the museum, etc., because I was lost in thought, I didn't notice and was about to step inside when I suddenly felt a gentle tap on my shoulder.

"..." I turned my head in surprise.

"Excuse me, sir, I believe you are carrying your gas mask?" A policeman who was at least twice my height, bent over, looked down, and had the kind of smile on his face that we see in pictures of the old god of longevity.

"Of course!" I hurriedly opened my briefcase.

Glancing at the gas mask stuffed in the corner of the box, he immediately closed the box for me, nodded, and sometimes raised his hand in a salute. "Excuse our stopping you. Thank you!"

"Excuse me for not having it on my shoulder. Thank you!"

At times like these, I also felt a sense of solemnity engulf my heart, and it lingered for a long time, making it difficult for me to read for quite a while.

I don't know why, but I always felt as if there was some connection between these trivial matters and all of Britain's internal and external positions and measures. Therefore, when I open my notes from that time, I can't help but think of these two trivial matters.

I have been back in China for three months in the blink of an eye. Now, flipping through my notes from that time, some have lost their timeliness, and some need to be reorganized or supplemented. And of course, there are many places that need to be greatly revised. The evolution of the European situation in the past month or two seems a bit dazzling on the surface, but in fact, even if we study and infer from the various situations at that time, they are all inevitable developments. A part of my notes at that time was related to the issue of neutrality of various European countries at that time. Now I give it a title and publish it for everyone's reference, because I have preserved the true picture of the impressions at that time, and nothing has been changed. The dates attached to each article at that time have not been erased.

(I) "Neutrality"

When we recall the second act after the so-called official declaration of the European war, which was the successive declarations of war by various third countries against Germany, and then look at the successive declarations of "neutrality" by various third countries after Britain and France declared war on Germany, the differences between them are very obvious and can be understood at once.

Of course, hidden beneath the noisy voices of "neutrality" are the recent tense diplomatic activities in various areas; what is making the fundamental decisions, however, is the shift in the overall international situation.

In Europe, the basic attitude of Britain and France is this: their consistent fundamental policy is to compromise with Germany and Italy, using Eastern, Southern, and Northern Europe as a bargaining chip to obtain their guarantee not to threaten their overseas colonies. In this line, they also pull in the Western European countries of the Netherlands and Belgium, which also have vast overseas colonies, and add Switzerland. However, if Germany and Italy show signs of infringing on the territory and independence of these Eastern, Southern, or Northern European countries, what attitude should Britain and France take? This can be divided into two situations: first, if Britain and France do not agree in advance, they will of course express their opposition; second, if they obtain tacit consent from Britain and France in advance and offer considerable exchange conditions, then they can also support it. An example of the former is the invasion of Albania this spring; the most obvious example of the latter is Czechoslovakia. However, if Germany and Italy directly threaten Britain and France themselves, what do Britain and France hope from these small countries? There is no question that they hope that they will declare war on Germany and Italy! In this sense, you can understand that in this war, the so-called "Allies," the relationship between the three countries is like this: rather than saying that Britain and France were tough on Germany because of the threat to Poland, and thus the war broke out, it would be better to say that Poland, because the disputes between Britain and France and Germany and Italy could not be resolved, and at the same time, believed that Germany would not use force against itself no matter what, therefore, in order to use this situation to obtain the satisfaction of expanding outwards, it was tough on Germany on the Danzig issue to the end, and thus the war broke out. Therefore, when studying this issue, we must always keep in mind the situation at the time of the outbreak of the war, which was: (1) from beginning to end, the door to German-Polish compromise was not closed until Britain and France declared war; (2) the biggest and most sensational demand of Germany and Italy on Britain and France, although it has been rumored for a long time, has not had the opportunity to be put forward because they are busy cleaning up the small European countries; probably once the European matter is completed, and the navy has been expanded in three or two years, the demand that will be immediately put forward to Britain and France is: to divide the world's colonies equally!

Let's look at the German side. Its consistent contempt for other ethnic groups and countries, and its consistent belief that the submission of various small European countries to Germany is a natural conclusion, on this point, there is no difference between today's German rulers, the Nazis, and its ruler, Emperor Wilhelm, twenty-five years ago. However, the difference is that in terms of the weapons to achieve his ambitions, Hitler has two more weapons than Wilhelm II: one is economic control, and the other is propaganda. This time, when the eyes of the whole world were attracted by the fire and blood of Hitler's war of aggression against Poland, everyone silently overlooked that Germany was simultaneously carrying out economic control over some other countries: it monopolized the entire export of kerosene and oil from Romania, monopolized the sales of all agricultural products from Hungary and Spain, and monopolized most of the exports of livestock and poultry from Yugoslavia. What was even more overlooked than this, however, was the constant onslaught of German propaganda. To this day, the situation in various small European countries is: on the one hand, they are trembling with fear of Germany's military power; on the other hand, the forces of those pro-German and pro-Italian internal fascist parties are raising their heads day by day. What does this mean? This means that under it, the German propaganda weapon has been effective; on its upper level, the pro-British and pro-French arguments in the small countries are being shaken. Then, what does Germany hope for in their specific attitude towards this war? As long as Germany has not made a great determination to fight Britain and France, it hopes that they will maintain so-called "neutrality," which means to keep the door wide open for its own import of raw materials and export of manufactured goods, making the naval blockade of Britain and France ineffective; at the same time, it also hopes that they will resist the blockade of Britain and France, and use the name of "violating neutrality" to provoke the relationship between them and Britain and France. If one day Germany makes a great determination to fight Britain and France, then, in addition to Italy and Spain inevitably joining the war, Germany will of course still hope that the remaining countries will "maintain neutrality" and act as transshipment agencies for goods for Germany and Italy, but at that time, for the sake of military necessity, perhaps one or more of the three countries, the Netherlands, Belgium, or Switzerland, will eventually be dragged in. As for the present, the important people of Germany, openly and secretly, on the eve of the invasion of Poland and in the days after the outbreak of the war, have repeatedly expressed to them: "We hope you will be neutral"; and said, "As long as Britain and France respect your neutrality, Germany will absolutely respect it."

Comparing the attitudes of Britain and France on one side and Germany on the other, we can roughly come to a conclusion: the "neutrality" of various countries is unfavorable to Britain and France; to Germany, it is a fixed plan and an ideal result. – I must add one more sentence: here, the word "neutrality" that I use is absolutely abstract and is not affected by other conditions. For example, if any small country joins the war, even if the side it joins is on the German side and is against Britain and France, what will be the result? It is still beneficial to Britain and France, and unfavorable to Germany; conversely, it is beneficial to Germany and unfavorable to Britain and France. If we use an example, we can just cite a country at random: if Bulgaria (or Yugoslavia) joins the war to help Germany, what will the situation be? In that situation, first of all, there will not be a big change in the comparison of military strength on both sides; but secondly, first, Britain and France can immediately block all its imports and exports in the Black Sea (or the Adriatic Sea), and second, British and French troops can immediately land in its territory and go through Romania to assist Poland, uniting the eastern and western battlefields.

Therefore, the work done by Germany's diplomacy and propaganda in recent times is the so-called localization of a conflict. The work of Britain and France, however, is: "In the name of humanity," they are also "hoping that the area of conflict will be limited;" however, in the name of strategy – although they have not said it – they are in fact looking towards the direction of the expansion of the battlefield, and proceeding slowly.

However, the fact revealed is the voice of universal "strict neutrality" – (September 16, London)

### Teachers' Day and Confucius' Birthday Are Held at the Same Time

The Shanghai education community initiated the celebration of Teachers' Day on June 6th and held it for several sessions.

Therefore, since last year, Teachers' Day has been changed to be held on Confucius' birthday. However, some school teachers in this city still take today as Teachers' Day and take a holiday, which is actually due to a mistake in memory, according to the Dahua News Agency.

### Zhen Ri Cup Small Football Tournament Coming to a Close: Two Years of Achievements

The Second Zhen Dan Cup Small Football League and International Cup, sponsored by the Aurora University Sports Committee, has been underway since the middle of last month. The champions of each division in League A and B, as well as the finalists in the international competition, have already been determined. After the championship battles to be held tomorrow and the day after, and the charity competition at the end of next week, this grand event will come to a successful conclusion. The organizers specially hosted a banquet last night at the aforementioned location on Rue Luber to entertain Chinese and foreign newspaper reporters. The Zhen Dan Cup, over the past two years, has earned immense praise from society. The motivation behind its initiation is worth recounting, as follows:

The Zhen Dan Cup small football tournament was conceived around the spring and summer of [year]. At that time, countless refugees in Shanghai were facing hardships. Aurora University, in the spirit of Catholicism, provided a football field as a site and opened a refugee shelter. To raise funds, they initiated the small football tournament. Its founding purpose was to merge charitable work with the promotion of sports. The income accumulated has reached a considerable amount and has been entirely allocated to relief efforts, benefiting the refugees, which is no small feat. Last year, it was originally intended to continue the event, but it was abandoned due to the closure of the refugee shelter and the holding of the French-Chinese Er Cup competition by the Sino-French Institute of Technology. This spring, Ma Xiangbo, a senior member of the National Government, passed away in Liangshan, Vietnam. In commemoration of Ma's achievements, Aurora University decided to construct a Ma Xiangbo Memorial Hall in the northwest corner of the new campus. The scale is extremely grand, with facilities such as a gymnasium and swimming pool. The plans have been completed and construction is scheduled to begin soon. To raise funds for the project, the second Zhen Dan Cup small football tournament was initiated. All ticket revenue will be allocated to the construction of the Ma Xiangbo Memorial Hall. As for the ticket revenue from the two championship finals tomorrow and the day after, it will be donated to the French Red Cross. The ticket revenue from next week's match between the Chinese United and the Western United teams will be allocated to the Sacred Heart Hospital in Shanghai. Over the past two years, the Zhen Dan Cup small football tournament has not only promoted sports but has also used every bit of the audience's contributions to benefit humanity. This is truly admirable.

### Gold Market Wants to Fall But Stops, Once Entering the 6,000 Yuan Mark

Yesterday's cash gold black market, wanted to fall but couldn't, and the market was uncertain, especially in the afternoon session where the trend was undecided with high and low points alternating. The opening was only 6,030 yuan, due to the continued strengthening of the opening exchange rate. Then, retail investors and money changers continuously released and sold, and suddenly fell into the 6,000 yuan mark, miserably reaching 5,940 yuan. Suddenly, a certain securities firm's bulls aggressively bought on the cheap, and silver firms also pulled. At the same time, the exchange rate also slightly turned softer. With the support of buyers, it returned to the 6,000 yuan mark and reached a high price of 6,150 yuan. However, the aforementioned securities firm had an unstable intention and soon sold out, and money changers and others also came to sell, and it fell back to 6,010 yuan. The afternoon closing was 6,095 yuan. The market outlook was stable in the quiet. The initial opening was 6,200 yuan, and buying and selling were in stalemate. Because silver firms and money changers were willing to release short positions, it once fell by more than 20 yuan. However, a certain silver firm's buying intention was very strong, and it rose again to 6,120 yuan before closing. The result was a final 6,100 yuan, which was 20 yuan better than the previous day. The total transaction was about three thousand and several hundred taels. Jewelry gold in silver shops was listed 10 yuan higher, while customs gold and other items remained level.

Gold Increased by 20 Yuan

Since the morning, each bar (ten taels), initially due to the weakening of the exchange rate and the weakness of people's hearts, the public sold at the opening, so gold shops gave silver firms ten taels for 6,030 yuan, which was a small 50 yuan less than the previous closing. Then, because the selling trend was still strong, and there were very few buyers, it immediately broke into the 6,000 yuan mark. A certain household gave a gold shop twenty taels, which became 5,940 yuan. Later, because a certain securities firm saw it cheap and was absorbing, and at that time the exchange rate market had turned tight, silver firms also followed by pulling vigorously, and short sellers saw [the situation] and rushed to cover their positions, jumping by 210 yuan. A silver firm gave a fellow firm a total of fifty taels, for 6,150 yuan. [Because] a certain [securities] firm's bulls made a profit and came out, and a certain silver firm and money changers also vigorously released each other, the market situation recovered and weakened. Securities firms and gold shops each gave money changers ten taels, all for 6,050 yuan. After 11:00 AM, gold shop [firms] suddenly came to compete and absorb, and a certain money changer also tended to absorb, and it rebounded again by 70 yuan. A silver firm gave a securities firm [a number of] taels, for 6,120 yuan. At noon, there were gradually fewer buyers, and gold shops and silver firms released and then stepped down by 25 yuan. A gold shop gave money changers 50 taels, for 6,095 yuan as the noon closing price. The afternoon opening was slightly higher by five yuan. A silver firm bought ten taels from a money changer, for 6,100 yuan. An off-hand gold shop did ten taels, for 6,105 yuan. Later, money changers and silver firms sold, and it stepped down by 25 yuan. A gold shop gave a silver firm ten taels, for 6,080 yuan. Then, because another silver firm frequently absorbed, and securities firms also had buying, it soon rose by 40 yuan. A securities firm bought [] taels from a silver firm, for 6,120 yuan. After entering, a certain silver firm released back, and retail investors also sold, so it fell back by 20 yuan. Silver firms made ten taels with each other, for 6,100 yuan, as the evening closing price. As a result, it increased by 20 yuan compared to the previous day. The high and low trading for the whole day was around 210 yuan. The selling price of spot gold by cash shops was tens of yuan higher than [the price of] gold, and the purchase price was reduced by 30 yuan. The current margin gold was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and both were rarely traded. The exchange of gold jewelry in silver shops was initially

Jewelry Listed 10 Yuan Higher

The exchange of jewelry gold in silver shops, initially Da Tong Hang still suspended 620 yuan, and at 9:45 it listed 10 yuan higher, and at 10:30 it fell back 10 yuan, and at 11:20 it listed 10 yuan higher again. There were no changes after this. It is estimated that Da Tong Hang changed to suspend 630 yuan, and the new peers had the same price, and the purchase price was reduced by about 30 yuan.

### Coal: Hongji Slag Discounted

Since the price of Hongji white coal lumps increased yesterday, only the price of Hongji No. 2 white coal slag, because it is the raw material for manufacturing coal balls, has been repeatedly requested by various small coal ball factories. From today, Yitai Xing, Dalong Xing, and fellow firms will dismantle and appropriately reduce the price. It is estimated that the port handling is 120 yuan per ton, and the delivery charge is added, which is 14 yuan lower than the previous market price.

### Medicinal Materials: Yizhiren Opens as Soon as it Arrives, Up 50-60 Yuan from Before

Yizhiren has been out of stock for a long time, and the market feels quite scarce. It is heard that several pieces have recently arrived from Qiongzhou and are immediately opened for sale. The transaction price is 220 yuan, which is 50-60 yuan higher than the previous market price. If there are no more arrivals later, it may rise again.

### Grains: Foreign Rice Continues to Arrive in Shanghai

Due to the fatigue of the previous day, the rice market was still soft yesterday morning, retail sales were sluggish, and speculators were also selling off. The prices of various foreign rice fell by 30-50 cents. Xiaowen opened at around 50 yuan, and Tokyo [type] rice was 49.5 yuan. [The market] turned because the original brokers have been holding [prices] steady. However, Hangzhou, Shaoxing, and Ningbo gangs suddenly took advantage of the cheap prices, and rural customers and local shops are preparing for the upcoming Dragon Boat Festival. In order to prepare for the market closure, they are preparing in advance. Temporarily, demand increased. Under various requests, a good opportunity for sellers was created, and shouts rose one after another. As a result, the market turned from fatigue to tightness.

Foreign rice once softened yesterday morning, but was quickly replenished by Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and other inland gangs. The 2,000 tons of Siam rice contacted by Jianyuan were not settled due to quota issues, and the market was raised by more than one yuan in the customer hoarding revival. Then, Heyi Foreign Company sold 750 tons of June lower rice at 59.8 yuan, which was a small corner less than the previous price. There were also other contacts, and the market began to return to level. The ups and downs were mixed in the afternoon, and the evening closing was still 50-80 cents higher than the previous evening. However, nearly 100,000 bags of Siam rice have been recently traded, and contact has not stopped. If the exchange rate shrinks slightly, it will inevitably come from the source, and the market may not see another surge.

Also, a large amount of foreign rice has arrived in Shanghai. Yesterday, Taikoo Company's Yingzhou ship arrived, carrying 9,900 bags from Hong Kong. At the same time, Qiongzhou ship arrived in Shanghai, also loaded with 8,907 bags from Hong Kong. A total of 18,807 bags arrived yesterday. The two ships were docked at piers 1 and 2 of the company in the French Concession. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, the workers unloading cargo from the ship went on strike, so it could not be unloaded yesterday.

Although five or six cars of japonica rice and glutinous rice continued to arrive yesterday, the selling price in the production area of japonica rice has risen and it is difficult to meet the Shanghai market, so although there are few rumors of off-market transactions, the selling intentions are very strong and all keep to the original market. The glutinous rice market was also soft in the early morning, and then it turned tight with the rise of foreign rice. As a result, the prices before and after can be called a settlement. It is estimated that Jinli special rice is 46.8-46.5 yuan, Changdan white rice is 45.6 yuan, and Jiangbei white rice is 43.4 yuan.

### Flour Sales Decline Due to Difficult Shipping

The flour market still tended to be strong yesterday, but sales have decreased compared to the previous two days. Because shipping is very difficult, new transactions have gradually become sluggish. It is estimated that about 6,000 bags were traded in small batches in the street. In order to maintain their nature, each factory still used the original price of 13.8 yuan. Except for supplying daily needs, they are unwilling to supply a large amount. Inland flour is also in a state of dwindling, and supply and demand are both quiet. It is heard that the production price in the mainland must be above 14 yuan, so there is no hope of a source for a while. Therefore, the market is calm, and the market will expand, waiting for the autumn when the new wheat is on the market. Also, 50,000 yuan of flour was shipped to Quanzhou yesterday, and 1,362 bags were shipped to Yantai today.

### Securities: Domestic Bonds See Mixed Gains and Losses, Foreign Stocks Continue to Decline

Yesterday's securities black market entered a state of rotating ups and downs. Category C hovered around the 50 yuan mark. Buyers wanted to buy low and sellers wanted to sell high, and neither would give way, so the market price was increasingly stagnant. The Category E bonds will be drawn tomorrow, and then it will be the turn of the 10th draw for Category A bonds in August, so the Category A market is uniquely strong, rising by as much as 1.7-1.8 yuan in recent days. As interest rates approach, there are also fewer sellers in each bond. In yesterday's trading, Xie Da Yichang absorbed quite a bit in the morning, while Hongkang and Nos. 16 and 38 offered a bit. The market was balanced. In the afternoon, Yitai, Tongshun, Yichang, Datong, and others bought in, while Runli, Lianhe, and retail investors sold out. The market price rebounded slightly, but the result was still mixed gains and losses, with only one or two corners. The transaction volume was about 700,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below.

Stock Trading: 30 shares of Bank of Communications stock were traded at a price of 67.75 yuan.

The stock market has renewed hesitation. The expectation of news about the war is even greater than the stimulation of commercial interests. The total daily trading volume was only 144,000 shares, and prices uniformly went downstream. British Listening stock fell by 1.75 yuan compared to the previous closing, [Company] [Small] by 2 yuan, Reclamation by 80 cents, Yihe by 2.25 yuan, and the previous closing prices for International, Shanghai, and Yangzi were 13.3 yuan, 14.3 yuan, and Zan 9.3 yuan respectively, while yesterday's closing prices were only 11.1 yuan, 13.1 yuan, and 8.65 yuan.

Among real estate stocks, Zhongying stock had no changes, while Zhonghe stock retreated by several corners to 14.6 yuan, Yeguang also fell slightly to 10 yuan, and Huamao stock was sold at 2.5 yuan.

There were more inquiries about rubber stocks, but buyers could only be attracted after prices were reduced.

London, 5th (Wednesday) - The listed market prices of Chinese foreign debt remained stable today, and there were no changes in bonds across the board.

London, 5th (Wednesday) - The listed market prices of various British companies' stocks fell slightly today. Shanghai Waterworks A shares fell by 1 pound to 14 pounds, and Security Insurance shares fell by 3 pounds to 25 pounds. The rest remained unchanged.

### Yarn and Cotton: Delivery of Futures Yarn Becomes Problematic, Decline in Local Yarn Remains Fierce

The yarn market continued to be weak, and the decline remained fierce. This is because the exchange rate is stable, there is no hope of improvement in overseas cotton markets, and the delivery of certain yarns is still facing problems. The selling price of existing yarn is declining step by step. Therefore, Chinese yarn is indirectly threatened. As a result, bulls are discouraged and sell out, and the market is unstable.

Sentiment in the existing yarn market remained weak in the morning, and there were few buyers in the market. The price of 20s Double Horse yarn was 1,300 yuan. It was later heard that the opening exchange rate had not changed much, and selling sentiment suddenly increased, and the market price fell step by step to 1,260 yuan. The market suddenly rumored that the Soviet Union had joined the Allied Forces, and buying increased slightly, returning to 1,280 yuan. The closing was slightly weak. As a result, the price of 20s Double Horse yarn fell by 36 yuan. The statistics of transactions in half a day totaled 1,445 bags. Today, 120 pieces of yarn will be shipped to Yantai and 1,710 pieces will be shipped to Tianjin. Also, yesterday, 432 pieces were shipped to Quanzhou. The amounts purchased by each gang are listed as follows:

Peers: 1,030, Hong Kong: 415

Total: 1,445

### Unstable Yarn Prices, More Tired Cotton Market

Cotton transactions were exceptionally quiet. This is due to the ups and downs of the local Indian and American cotton markets, coupled with unstable yarn prices, so morale is scattered, and factories are at a loss. The market is even more tired. The details of current cotton transactions are listed below:

Dazhong Collection 242.00 - Peers bought 100 bags
Kangjiang Flower 202.00 - Peers bought 100 pieces
Mittelring 292.00 - Peers bought 100 pieces
Also 298.00 - Xinyu bought 100 pieces

Also, concerning the market price of foreign cotton, the New York cotton market has not improved in recent days. First, the market lacks major buyers, and then due to the decline in stock prices on Wall Street and the sale of a portion of spot goods, the closing prices were flat for the near term and fell by seven or eight pounds for the long term. The Indian market has stabilized. Yesterday's [price] predicted an increase of one rupee.

The foreign cotton transactions in Shanghai have not loosened recently. Although the Tianjin gang occasionally has some transactions, the number is not large, so it has not affected the market. The prices of term cotton sent to factories, converted at the US dollar exchange rate of 5.3125 yesterday, are as follows:

20s - American Mittelring - 316.95
Also - Also - Lower Grade - 307.00
32s - Also - 325.00
Also - Also - Lower Grade - 324.10
42s - Also - 338.90
Also - Also - Lower Grade - 329.80

### Piece Goods: Poplin, Foreign Yarn, and Bleached Cloth See Extreme Transactions

In the domestic cloth market, current sales in various directions have gradually developed recently. However, due to the large number of hoarded goods, sentiment was weak under the influence of the yarn price decline yesterday. Small floating hoards of selling orders are the loosest, so although the overall market is stable, a portion of scattered coarse and fine cloth and bleached and dyed cloth fell by 25-50 cents per piece. Customers are also taking a wait-and-see attitude, and transactions have sharply decreased. Approximately 100 pieces of woven cloth and greige were traded on the street. Wholesale and retail business for local and out-of-town [customers] traded more than 3,000 pieces, mainly poplin, foreign yarn, and bleached cloth. Guangdong sales of printed cloth and twill are relatively strong at approximately 100 pieces, and the Sichuan and Yunnan gangs sold forty to fifty boxes of blue cloth.

The Eastern cloth market remains sluggish, and selling orders continue to decline. Longtou fine cloth opened at only 39.5 yuan in the morning, and later rebounded to 40.025 yuan. Sizijun serge once fell to 1.025 yuan, and the closing price was 1.035 yuan. Mid-range miscellaneous fine cloth fell by another yuan per piece compared to the previous day, and the situation is particularly [].

### French-Western Lining Increases

The overall market for woolen fabrics remained strong yesterday, and all goods tended to be excellent. Both retail and wholesale transactions were strong. The French-Western lining market is currently seeing a squeeze. Both imported and domestic goods are mostly out of stock. Western goods, Love 277, have not been imported, and market inventory is limited. In addition to Hongsheng 288 and Yinfeng 1470, there is no production of domestic factory goods. The current supply does not meet the demand, and the standard will be immediately increased. Yesterday, the current wholesale price of Love 277 French-Western lining was traded in the marketplace, 2 [units] net, 288 sold for 1.4 yuan, and 1470 sold for 1.05 yuan.

### Palles Stripes are the Most Popular

Palles is at the peak of its sales season. Sales of clothing for both Chinese and Western styles are widespread. The sales are mainly for striped and other patterned goods, which are the most popular, and the market has seen an increase as a result. Plain colors seem to be more tired. Although their outlets are also prosperous, their supply is abundant, so they cannot rise. Currently, plain Palles are only sold in store clothing stores, while striped and patterned Palles are needed for both Chinese and Western styles. The shipment and local production of plain colors are more than stripes, and the market conditions have created popular stripes and plain colors. Recently, the average high and low difference in the current wholesale price of striped and plain Palles is one or two yuan per yard.

### Silk and Tea Overseas: Silk Prices Decline; Filature Cocoons Exceed 500 Yuan

Overseas silk prices have declined uniformly in Japan and the United States, stimulated by poor actual sales of raw silk in New York last month. Japanese silk has fallen by 4.75 points on the 83rd grade, Chinese silk has fallen by 3 points, New York's near and far futures have each fallen by 2.5 points, Yokohama spot prices have fallen by 40 yuan, and far futures have fallen by 23 yuan. The Shanghai silk market is quiet. The silk itself is already expensive, and foreign firms are further reducing prices. The price difference between domestic and foreign silk is significant, so no transactions are taking place.

In the Wuxi cocoon market, because small silk factories and the brokers are raising prices, improved fresh cocoons have exceeded 500 yuan per picul. Consequently, "Central China" is finding it difficult to purchase raw materials, so it issued an "order" to stop weighing cocoons the day before yesterday, in order to lower the price of low-grade cocoons.

Twenty bales of rayon, shipped from Hong Kong by the Taikoo Company's Yingzhou轮 [steamer], arrived the day before yesterday. Today, more than 450 bales of rayon originally in this city are being loaded onto the Taikoo Company's Hunan轮 [steamer] to be transported to Tianjin. Due to a strike by dockworkers on the ship, it is feared that they will not be able to be shipped out today. (Zu)

### Green Tea: European Sales Remain Sluggish

Yesterday, the green tea market situation for foreign firms was as follows: European firms are very pessimistic about importing due to the worsening international situation. The market for Chun Mei green tea has seen almost no transactions in the past week because overseas dispatches do not urgently need it. Yesterday, only Xiehe, Jianfudede, and other firms purchased ordinary Zhen Mei and Fine Needle teas, totaling just over 160 boxes. Zhen Mei sold for 365 yuan, and Fine Needle tea sold from 95 to 105 yuan, unchanged from before.

In addition, 770 pieces of tea arrived from Hong Kong yesterday, another 36 pieces from Ningbo, and 2,322 pieces from Wuzhou. Today, 80 pieces will be transported to Yantai, and another 605 pieces will be transported to Tianjin.

### Sugar Market: Foreign Sugar Continues to Loosen

Yesterday, the sugar market continued to loosen. The guild’s price assessment for spot No. 24 coarse white sugar was 71 yuan at the local warehouses in the morning and 71.5 yuan in the afternoon. Prices for goods at outside warehouses fluctuated, initially at 70 yuan, then falling by half a yuan, before returning to 71 yuan, and finally settling at 70.8 yuan in the afternoon, a drop of 0.4 yuan. Transshipment goods were priced at 57.2 to 57.5 yuan, also 57.5 yuan in the afternoon. Taikoo granulated B mark was 82.5 yuan, down 0.7 yuan, and H mark raw was 58.5 yuan, and Dutch raw was 60.5 yuan, both down 0.5 yuan. Locally produced white sugar was 71 yuan, Xiaoyuan second grade, and locally produced rock sugar was 92.5 yuan, and Jingming rock sugar was 94 yuan, all trending downwards. In addition, 2,937 bags of sugar arrived from Hong Kong yesterday.

### North-South Goods: Daylily Now Sold for Cash

Daylily was previously traded with drafts, but recently, because the discount rate fluctuates unpredictably, sellers in various regions feel quite inconvenienced. Yesterday, the Zhenjiang gang sold a batch of daylily, with the deal being 37.5 jiao in cash.

### Seafood: Western Sea Cucumber Arrivals and Sales are Equal

Recently, the arrival and sales of Western sea cucumber have been equal, and the situation is stable. Another batch was sold yesterday, with selected red sea cucumber strips at 220 yuan, special grade at 204 yuan, No. 1 red at 186 yuan, No. 2 at 176 yuan, No. 3 at 152 yuan, and No. 4 at 126 yuan.

### French Ambassador Issues Official Statement: No Negotiations with U.S. Authorities; "Trusteeship of Concessions" is Groundless; Japanese Again Spread Rumors of German Envoy Seeking Peace; Sincere Company Denies News of Sale to Japanese

Havas News Agency, local dispatch: The French Embassy in China has recently issued the following statement: For some time, rumors have been circulating within China that the French authorities in Shanghai are conducting secret negotiations with the U.S. authorities, planning to temporarily transfer the administrative and police powers of the French Concession to the U.S. authorities. The French Embassy in China hereby resolutely denies this rumor. United Press, Shanghai, June 6: U.S. and French authorities in Shanghai today again denied Japanese rumors that France plans to transfer the French Concession in Shanghai to the United States. U.S. authorities stated that they had heard nothing about this proposal. A French spokesperson stated, "This rumor is completely groundless."

Tokyo Acts Earnestly

United Press, Tokyo, June 6: Japanese newspapers today report that the Japanese government "attaches importance" to news carried by Japanese sources in Shanghai regarding France's plan to transfer the rights of the French Concession in Shanghai to the United States. Japanese newspapers hinted that, given Japan's role as a "stabilizing force in East Asia," the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs plans to lodge a protest with both France and the United States. It is reported that the Asia Bureau has taken note of news coming from Shanghai, but Japanese newspapers did not carry denials from U.S. and French officials in Shanghai. According to an official statement issued by the Asia Bureau, France must contact the "Wang regime" and transfer the French Concession to the "Nanjing government." Japanese Navy Spokesperson Rear Admiral Kanatake stated today at a press conference, "If France truly intends to transfer the French Concession in Shanghai to the United States, the Japanese government cannot ignore this."

Rumors Resurface: German Envoy to Return Home

Since the war situation has turned unfavorable for the Japanese, with repeated defeats, they have shifted their focus to deploying a so-called "rumor offensive." The story of the ambassadors of Britain, France, and the United States conducting peace talks was spread previously, followed by news of "peace" being transmitted from Rome, but rumors are groundless and self-defeating, and often clarified by facts in short order. Recently, after fabricating rumors such as "U.S. troops withdrawing" and "police power of the French Concession being transferred to the United States" in Japanese newspapers in Shanghai, the Japanese *Continental New Report* even published a message the previous day (May 5th) stating that German Ambassador to China, Dr. Trautmann, would return to Germany in the near future, and claiming that "this trip is related to the Sino-Japanese peace negotiations." A reporter from the *Great China News Agency* specifically inquired about this matter at the

German Embassy

The person in charge of the Shanghai office confirmed that this news was also completely unfounded. According to the person in charge of the office, "German Ambassador to China, Dr. Trautmann, has absolutely no plans to leave Shanghai and return to Germany. Japanese newspapers may have mistakenly transmitted the recent return to Germany of Mr. Bidde of the German Embassy in China." This proves the exhaustion of their rumor-mongering skills.

Dutch Ship Not Escorted by U.S. Warship

Yesterday, the Japanese Domei News Agency also claimed that a Dutch ship had arrived in Shanghai escorted by a U.S. warship on Tuesday of this week. This was denied by an officer of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet here, who pointed out that no U.S. Navy ships had arrived in Shanghai on Tuesday. Observers say that the Japanese are repeatedly fabricating facts and spreading all kinds of unfounded rumors, which is obviously a planned and purposeful effort.

Sincere Company Denies Transfer

The Japanese side yesterday also reported that the local Sincere Company would be purchased by the Japanese side for 30 million yuan, and said that the two sides are currently negotiating. However, yesterday the authorities of the Sincere Company officially denied the rumors. According to the company authorities, speaking to the *Great China News Agency*, this news is completely unfounded. The Sincere Company has never offered the company for sale, and the Japanese and other parties have never requested to purchase the company.

Also, this news was seen in the Japanese *Daily News* on April 2nd, and the company published a statement in the Chinese newspapers of this city on April 4th, claiming that the matter was absolutely incorrect. Unexpectedly, after a month, they fabricated the same news again. The company's total capital is 3 million yuan, and current business is even better than before. The Japanese

fabrication of rumors

The motives are difficult to fathom, and the company authorities also said they could not explain it. However, the company's business department said that this move by the Japanese side is because Japanese merchants are eager to seek a base in Shanghai for dumping their goods. It is also learned that after the Japanese first announced the news of purchasing the Sincere Company two months ago, the Japanese newspapers repeatedly

revealed

and hyped up this news. Yesterday, the Japanese side also claimed, "The negotiations for the Japanese purchase of the Sincere Company have made significant progress. According to reliable sources, the Japanese side has now offered 25 million yen to purchase all the buildings and equipment, while the company insists on 30 million Japanese yen."

### Grand Opening of Great Wall Insurance Company

Great Wall Insurance Company was established by leaders of the financial and industrial circles in this city, with the approval of the Ministry of Economic Affairs. Insurance experts have been hired to manage the company. The grand opening was yesterday, and people from all walks of life came to offer congratulations in an endless stream. In one day, the company accepted a large amount of insurance from major domestic goods manufacturers and banks. The company's business policy is to fully underwrite the assets of local Chinese people, and, given the large number of overseas Chinese in Nanyang islands and the Dutch East Indies, the company will also establish branches there.

### U.S. Implements Embargo; Japanese Authorities Feel Unease; U.S. Aims to Eliminate War; Japan Threatens with Southern Advance Plan

According to foreign sources, the U.S. government notified the Japanese authorities on the 3rd of this month that it had issued an order prohibiting the shipment of all raw materials needed to realize the country's military expansion plan to foreign countries. Tokyo was extremely shocked upon receiving the news, as the scope of this embargo is wider than before. Japan will bear the brunt of it, and the impact will be significant. Many believe that the U.S. authorities took this action because they were extremely dissatisfied with the recent

air raids on Chongqing by Japanese aircraft, which echoed the activities of Nazi Germany in Belgium and northern France. The United States decided to take this action to warn Japan. Also, a private message from Washington stated that the U.S. authorities will no longer send any warnings or diplomatic documents to Japan, but have decided to bring Japan to heel, and its purpose is not to start a war but to eliminate war. U.S. public opinion unanimously believes that the time has come to impose economic sanctions on Japan. If Japan continues to act recklessly, it will undoubtedly suffer the most unfavorable consequences. However, a senior Japanese military officer in Tokyo told foreign reporters that if Western countries refuse to supply raw materials to Japan, Japan will inevitably implement its southern advance plan. Japan, unrepentant, continues to threaten the great powers, with malicious intent that is truly unpredictable.

### The Latent Financial Trend Is Not Optimistic

Year-End Loans: Special Prudence

The Dragon Boat Festival settlement for Shanghai's industry and commerce is approaching. Each industry has separately sent personnel to collect outstanding debts. The banking industry is busy collecting and settling accounts. The Shanghai branch of the Four Banks Joint Office is working hard to regulate the finances of its peers, ensuring the continued stability of the financial system. Banks have decided to take a day off for the Dragon Boat Festival (June 10th) as usual. They are also aware that while Shanghai's financial situation appears very stable on the surface, the latent trend is not optimistic. The ratio of current to fixed-term deposits is high, with current deposits accounting for as much as 20%, and the trend is increasing. Nowadays, those with funds in Shanghai are competing to speculate and manipulate the market. The use of funds lies in being able to cope with any situation at any time, so that windfall profits can be sought. Meager fixed-term deposit interest rates are not considered, so everyone is flocking to current accounts, waiting for an opportunity to move and use funds. Therefore, banks must be prudent with all loans to prevent speculation and manipulation.

### Stamp Tax in Shanghai Concession Areas Transferred to Direct Tax Office

In order to collect inheritance tax and other direct taxes, the Ministry of Finance has specially established a Direct Tax Office, with Gao Bingfang as the director. The responsibilities of the office are: (1) Collecting national income tax, inheritance tax, and other direct taxes, and also handling stamp tax collection; (2) Studying and improving the systems and tax rates of the various taxes under its jurisdiction, and reviewing tax rates; (3) Handling cases of tax reduction, tax exemption, and tax refunds for the various taxes under its jurisdiction; (4) Calculating, auditing, registering, and reporting tax revenues for the various taxes under its jurisdiction; (5) Drafting, reviewing, interpreting tax laws and regulations for the various taxes under its jurisdiction, and handling disputes with the Ministry; (6) Appointing, dismissing, transferring, and evaluating tax personnel for the various taxes under its jurisdiction; (7) Other matters related to the tax affairs of the various taxes under its jurisdiction. It is heard that the stamp tax in the Shanghai concession areas, which was previously handled by the Tax Affairs Bureau, has now been transferred to the Direct Tax Office. Before the establishment of the Direct Tax Office, it will be temporarily handled by the Shanghai branch of the Income Tax Office.

### Municipal Government Documents in the Custody of the Public Works Department

The puppet "Mayor" Fu Xiaoan recently "requested" the Public Works Department to return the documents of the former Shanghai Municipal Government Land Bureau that were deposited with the Public Works Department. The Public Works Department resolutely refused, as it was its duty to do so. In the previous year, the puppet "government" had once attempted to seize these documents by illegal means. The Bureau specially mobilized a large number of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps to guard day and night to prevent accidents. Later, in order to make it permanent, the Bureau built extremely thick walls around the room where the documents were stored, and all doors and windows were dismantled and replaced with walls. It is not only extremely sturdy, but also has no gaps. Armed volunteer corps are still stationed around to guard the area.

### The Puppet "Shanghai Market" Commodity Tax Collection Issues

In addition to the "Central Market" at the Xizang Road bridge and the "Food Market" on Wusong Road, which are Japanese puppet organizations controlling vegetable and local product prices in this city, a "Shanghai Market" has recently emerged. Competition among them has become increasingly fierce, and vegetable and local product merchants are in dire straits, caught in the net. The control methods of the "Shanghai Market" are the same as those of the "Food Market" on Wusong Road. A "donation tax" of 3% is levied on the price of goods, and then merchants are allowed to "operate freely." However, according to a letter from lawyer Hu Fenglian, there is no matter of donating 3% at "Shanghai Market".

### Summary of Important News

Postal Notice: (1) Due to the special local situation, all parcels and bulk small package mail items to the Tanghu Town, Xishan Beizhen, and Baibao Town agency offices under the Yixian Bureau in the Beiping District should be temporarily suspended for acceptance. (2) Insured parcels to the Xiuwu Bureau (temporarily transferred from the Henan District to the jurisdiction of the Beiping District) can now be accepted again.

The puppet "Shanghai Municipal Government Finance Bureau" has "established a so-called Collection Office for Paper Money and Paper Products," occupying the site of the China Morality Oil Factory on Wusong Road in Hongkou as its location. It was declared "established" on the 1st of this month, and all tin foil paper will be subject to a heavy tax.

The Nanshi "Local Court" is planning to take over the Pudong and Huxi "Sub-Courts." Because the Japanese special affairs agency firmly opposed cooperation in Pudong, the attempt to take over on the previous day did not succeed.

### Shaoxing Rice Allows Free Exchange; Rice Bound for Ningbo Arrives Today; Ningbo Fellow Association Holds General Meeting Today

A rice shortage has occurred in seven counties of Shaoxing, and the situation is severe. The Shanghai Shaoxing Fellow Association is actively raising funds to purchase rice and transport it to their hometowns for relief, in order to serve their homeland. They also telegraphed the Ministry of Finance, earnestly requesting free exchange of foreign currency. Yesterday, the Shaoxing Fellow Association revealed that it had received a reply telegram from Shanghai gentry Wang Xiaolai regarding the matter of telegraphed request for free exchange of foreign currency for disaster relief, as follows: "Telegram received. Deeply concerned about the rice shortage in our hometown. I visited Kong, and it has been approved as requested, totaling two million yuan in total. Wang Detian (5th)"

Second Batch of Foreign Rice

The association began relief work last winter after Xiaoshan fell. When Shangyu was ravaged by Japanese aircraft on March 28th and 29th, they organized the Shangyu Emergency Relief Association and the Shangyu People's Food Regulation Association to plan relief methods. They also commissioned Association member Lu Zhinan to take 154,000 yuan to return to his hometown for emergency relief. Furthermore, they ordered 4,000 bags of貢 [tribute] rice from Hong Kong. In addition to the 2,000 bags already shipped, the remaining 2,000 bags, added to the rice shipment on the Glen Line [steamer], are being shipped from Hong Kong to Ningbo and then to Shaoxing, and are expected to arrive today. The association has commissioned four people to go to Shaoxing to handle price stabilization, with a stabilized price of 40 yuan per stone. The total loss is about 100,000 yuan.

Shangyu People's Food Association Appeals for Donations

The Shangyu People's Food Regulation Association wrote to Shangyu compatriots, calling for donations for disaster relief. The original letter said, "We are writing to you to report that, according to Commissioner Zhao's report in Shanghai, the rice shortage in the interior has reached its extreme. Eating bran and gnawing grass is common. In addition, the weather is arid, rivers are drying up, and 30-40% of the rice paddies have not been planted. If it does not rain in another five days, the seedlings that have already been planted will also crack and die. The arrival of rice from Shanghai this time was a great joy for the town. At the same time, a letter from Mr. Yu Yixuan also stated that the rice shortage and early drought have come one after another. Women cry in the kitchen, and farmers sigh in the fields. The sad words are unbearable to read. We think of the Shangyu compatriots in Shanghai, most of whom are enlightened and generous. In this time of hardship in our hometown, with the people's lives hanging by a thread, we dare to ask you to give generously, widely appealing to everyone, to continue the survival of our community. Donations should be delivered to the Tongrun Qianzhuang at No. 13 Ji Yi Lane, Tianjin Road, or the Zi Ze Qianzhuang on Ningbo Road, and a receipt should be obtained."

Ningbo Fundraising Association Holds General Meeting Today

The Ningbo Price Stabilization Fundraising Association will hold a general meeting at the Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Association at 4:00 PM today. Association Chairman Yu Qiaqing has personally donated 100,000 yuan in national currency, and Vice Chairmen Qin Runqing and Zhang Jiguang have each pledged to raise 100,000 yuan to promote the cause. Various industries, such as the new medicine industry, the coal industry, the jewelry industry, and the sugar industry, have already collected significant amounts. The association's fundraising goal is a total of 1.5 million yuan. With the support of various sectors, it should not be difficult to exceed the original target. Today's general meeting will be attended by the Fenghua Shanghai Fellow Association. It is reported that the association has recently raised more than 200,000 yuan, and has sent commissioners Le Zhenbao, Mu Zixiang, and others to Ningbo to handle price stabilization. It is heard that the 20,000 bags of foreign rice loaded on the Glen Line are expected to arrive in Ningbo today and will be used for price stabilization immediately.

Dire Rice Shortage in Dinghai Shiqi

According to visitors from Dinghai, the county is isolated overseas, consisting of a group of islands. The entire territory is mostly mountainous with little farmland, and rice production is very low. The food needed by the people has always depended on supplies from other counties. Since the county seat fell, rice prices within the city have soared due to the disruption of transportation. In the rural areas, the county government has coordinated adjustments to stabilize prices. However, recently, due to the impact of soaring grain prices everywhere, the price of rice in the city has reached a record high of 73 yuan per picul. In the eastern township and various islands, it has also reached around 50 yuan. The food panic is becoming more serious.

Chen Xiaolu, the town head of Shiqi, came to Shanghai to raise funds to transport rice for disaster relief, as detailed in this newspaper. We now know that the town government sent an urgent telegram to Shanghai yesterday, saying that all the rice in the villages has run out, and the villagers are filling their stomachs with grass roots. Please quickly raise funds to purchase rice for relief. After receiving the telegram, Chen immediately asked the local tycoons Yuan Ludeng, Zhang Shenzhi, and Fang Jiaobo to assist, and they are actively soliciting donations from local villagers in Shanghai and enthusiastic people from all walks of life. Starting today, they have entrusted the Ningbo Gazette on Guizhou Road to collect donations on their behalf. Last night, Yang Zhishui donated 100 yuan and Li Shenru donated 50 yuan after hearing the news, and both were sent to the newspaper for collection.

### Labor Unrest at British Tram Company Branch Resolved

The labor strike by 300 workers at the Kerr Road branch of the Shanghai British Tram Company last week has been resolved. The patrol officers stationed at each branch of the company have also been withdrawn.

### Schools and Entertainment Industry Mobilize to Support Road Safety Campaign; Cooperate to Intensify Publicity; 1 Million Leaflets for Each Group

The Public Safety Week, initiated by the police authorities of both the Public and French Concessions this year, is scheduled to be held from the 17th to the 23rd of this month. The details of the strong support received from all walks of life have already been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday, Chen Xuanshan of the Education Department and Yao Jiakun of the General Traffic Department of the Public Works Department convened the principals of various middle schools at the Public Works Department School on Ximo Road to discuss everything. It was decided to send about 20 students from each of the "Safety Week" patrols to various designated locations to advise pedestrians and distribute leaflets. It is heard that armbands will be issued to the students by the General Traffic Department, and they can ride buses and trams free of charge during Safety Week. As for the radio stations, they have already been broadcasting the three safety records daily. The entertainment industry, such as Liu Ziyun, Zhang Yezhi, Li Zhuan, Huang Zhaolin, Dong Tianmin, and others, are also said to have been contacted by Yao to step up their publicity efforts during the period to reduce road accidents. A million leaflets are said to be needed for each group of pedestrians, car drivers, rickshaw pullers, rickshaw pullers, and small car drivers.

### French Concession Chinese Ratepayers Association's Warning Against Speculation and Monopoly: Shanghai Merchants and Citizens Should Uphold Native Land Salvation; Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Indeed Robust

The French Concession Chinese Ratepayers Association issued a warning to merchants and citizens within the concession, stating: Since early May, the city's financial situation suddenly became turbulent, foreign exchange shrank drastically, and the market situation was chaotic. Many shops, using this as an excuse, competed to raise prices, with multiple increases a day, without end. However, upon investigation, the goods with raised prices were all acquired beforehand, bearing no relation to the drastic shrinkage of foreign exchange. This is very obvious. Now that foreign exchange has eased and the market has stabilized, there are hardly any cases of goods with past price increases returning to their original state. Therefore, raising prices is clearly speculative in nature, seeking undue profit, which is known to all. Merchants seeking profit is not something to be criticized, but only prioritizing profit, sucking the marrow of the bones, only seeking self-enrichment while placing the public in danger, and disregarding social safety is absurd and infuriating. In this extraordinary time, everything is difficult. All Chinese people should recognize their respective goals and at least create a position of native land salvation. What is the merchant's native land salvation? Not monopolizing, not hoarding, not speculating, and not raising prices. Not monopolizing, hoarding, speculating, or raising prices means not being a treacherous merchant, not being a social criminal, and being worthy of being a descendant of the Yellow Emperor. It is understood that the concession authorities in this city have established strict sanctions against those who monopolize, hoard, and speculate, and will implement them soon. Therefore, we dare to sincerely advise all merchants and citizens within the concession to immediately awaken, encourage each other, and restore the raised prices to their original state before May. Do not test the law and disregard it, which is deeply anticipated.

Stabilization Fund

According to the French-language Shanghai Daily, as generally known, the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee does indeed hold foreign exchange of £2 million or £2.5 million or more, sufficient to suppress speculators from causing too much trouble in June. According to market estimates, there are still 12 million US dollars of hot money circulating in the local market. It is now heard that of this amount, 5 million US dollars are in the hands of the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund, 3 million US dollars are in the hands of various banks, and only 4 million US dollars are in the hands of speculators. Based on this speculation, if the banks do not assist speculators, then the momentum of speculators has weakened, and the fund of the Stabilization Fund is extremely robust. If there are no unexpected rumors, then in June, the local foreign exchange market should be stable, as speculators will inevitably restrain themselves in this environment and dare not act arbitrarily.

Strict Inspection of Rice Weevils

The entire rice market in this city, after various rice industry groups devised methods for rectification, buying and selling by the same industry has gradually entered the right track. Regarding the stock of rice warehouses alone, according to the Bean and Rice Industry Association, there are now more than one million bags. Although this is a time of year when the old harvest is exhausted and the new one is not yet in, the rice price in Shanghai may turn to loosen. The reason is nothing more than the weather turning hot, and warehouse goods are prone to change, so major households have no intention of further hoarding. Currently, relevant rice industry groups are determined to strictly crack down on those who buy and sell repeatedly, seeking profit from the middle, in order to alleviate the burden on each firm. This is currently under discussion, and once it is ready, it will be announced to the market and implemented.

Impressions of Stopping Foreign Exchange Swaps

A recent issue of the English-language Financial and Commercial News reported that since the Sino-Foreign banks announced the suspension of foreign exchange swaps last week, the market has experienced chaos. According to the methods announced by the Sino-Foreign banks, after that, except for interbank lending or legitimate commercial transactions, foreign exchange swaps for speculators will be unanimously rejected. The majority opinion on this measure is that the banks are acting at the request of the Stabilization Committee, with the aim of

Cracking Down on Speculation

Stabilizing the exchange market. In principle, it should be supported by the public. The establishment of the Stabilization Fund, on the contrary, allows people to attack the exchange market, minimizing the opportunity for speculators to lose and maximizing the hope of profit, which is actually equivalent to encouraging speculation. In normal times, speculation is a two-sided approach (there is both buying and selling), so there is no need to force correction. However, at present, speculative actions tend to be one-sided, so it is necessary to correct them. However, whether the currently adopted method of refusing foreign exchange swaps can achieve the expected purpose,

Seems Uncertain

Foreign exchange swaps also have their needs in commerce, but compared with the needs in speculation, it is just a drop in the ocean. For swap transactions, some banks will accommodate those who can provide the name of the firm and indicate that it is for legitimate commercial purposes, which is contrary to the original purpose of refusing swap transactions. Even if all banks strictly comply with the refusal of swaps, it is not difficult to transfer swaps for customers by simultaneously buying and selling futures, as long as the exchange rate difference is not lower than one thirty-second of an English pound or one sixteenth of a US dollar. The result is just for brokers to

Increase Transactions

That's all. A banker once expressed the opinion that why can't the general depositors of banks use their deposits in the bank for foreign exchange arbitrage, which often has a weekly interest rate of around five or six points and has very little risk. Why can depositors only deposit cash into the bank, allowing the bank to use the deposits to engage in arbitrage? The new method can only attack speculators with weak financial resources and has little effect on large households. This kind of argument misunderstands the original intention of the Stabilization Committee. However, we cannot forget that there are many banks in Shanghai and

Operating Scope

Is also inconsistent. Those who operate normal deposit and loan businesses are naturally willing to see the elimination of speculation, but there are also banks that specialize in speculation. Once they cannot implement speculative tricks, they themselves will inevitably collapse. We have heard that although the principle of swap transactions has been abolished, market changes have been very small, and swaps are still convenient, but without this name. Selling and buying are only three minutes apart. There are those in the market who express absolute compliance with the rules, and their buying and selling are handled by separate banks, so people in the market are satisfied. The actual situation remains the same.

### Norwegian Merchant Wilhelm's Ships: Shipping Operations Concentrated in Shanghai: Over Sixty Ships are Extremely Large: The Last Ship Leaving Norway Arrives in Shanghai Today

The British firm Butterfield & Swire in this city has been operating the Daiping, Taiping, Taiyang, and Taiyi ships on the Pacific route for many years. After the outbreak of the Second European War, it happened that the Norwegian shipowner of the Pacific Line, Wilh Wilesen (transliteration), had many new ships completed. They originally planned to send the four Tai ships to Europe and the new ships to the Far East. Recently, due to the expansion of the European war, navigation to Europe is difficult. All of Wilhelm's ships have come and concentrated in Shanghai. The Pacific and other ships will also come to Shanghai soon. It is heard that Wilhelm's ships are

Solely Owned

There are over sixty ships, and the ship bodies are huge, with the largest tonnage being 11,334 tons and the smallest being 6,608 tons. They operate on global routes, and the Far East is entrusted to the British firm Butterfield & Swire as the general agent. It is heard that after the fall of Norway, Norwegian ships all operate in their own country. Wilhelm's last

Norwegian

Ship, the Talieyrand, is expected to arrive in Shanghai this morning and is scheduled to dock at the Huashun Pier in Hongkou. The ship is carrying a large amount of steel materials and foreign paper, which can also be considered the last batch of Norwegian goods to arrive in Shanghai. Before the cessation of the European war, Norwegian ships can only take the Far East as their starting point. Also, the regular fast mail ship of the Swedish Postal Company,

The Kantiefotian, entered the port of Shanghai and docked at the Gonghexiang Pier at 2:30 PM yesterday. This is the last ship to come to Shanghai

One. The ship is carrying a total of 586 passengers, most of whom are Jewish refugees seeking refuge in Shanghai and overseas Chinese affected by the European war. In addition, due to the war, there are few goods, only 160 pieces, and a piece of mail sent from Europe on May 10. After the ship unloads passengers and goods,

Afterwards, it is scheduled to depart from Shanghai and return to Europe on the 9th (Sunday) at 10:00 AM, following the

Original Route, also calling at ports such as Hong Kong, Singapore, Manila, Mumbai, and Colombo, and returning to Genoa via the Suez Canal, with no changes. Upon arrival in Shanghai, it will enter

Stop and anchor, and will be slightly repaired, waiting for changes in the war situation to determine its future actions. If Italy joins the whirlpool of the European war, it may be requisitioned by the government. If news of Italy's participation in the war arrives while the ship is sailing from Shanghai to Europe, it will temporarily stay on the coast of a neutral country. However, this time, due to the intense European war and the tense situation in the Mediterranean, both passengers and goods are extremely light. Furthermore, according to news from foreign merchants in the shipping industry, the Hong Kong government

Recently issued a notice prohibiting the import of automobiles, wireless electrical equipment, and other parts. If they need to be transported, they must obtain a special permit from the Hong Kong government in advance and be given a passport before they can be transported in.

According to those in charge of the Shanghai Postal Administration, regardless of domestic and foreign mail delivery, the bureau handles it according to bureau

Regulations. Before receiving orders, it will still be sealed, sent, and transported on ships on time. European mail delivery currently has no problems and will still be transported via the Pacific and Suez lines. Currently, mail from Shanghai to European countries is all forwarded through Hong Kong, and all kinds of large and small postal parcels are also being collected and sent. In short, the post office will try to deliver within its capacity so that people in Shanghai can inquire about family news at any time. Although the bureau has temporarily suspended receiving parcels to Germany, if the sender indicates "Transferred through domestic postal routes" on the cover, and the domestic postal route is indeed passable, it can still be collected and sent, and sample postal parcels transported via Vietnam, containing German goods and sent from or consigned to German people, will be handled in the same way.

Although the European war is in full swing, postal delivery between Shanghai and Europe can still be carried out as usual.

### Butterfield & Swire Steamboat Company: Stevedores' Strike: Workers Demand Wage Increase from Foremen: Import and Export of All Ships Stalled

The British firm Butterfield & Swire Steamboat Company has 46 oceangoing vessels and 18 river steamers, with routes covering various ports along the Yangtze River, the coast of China, and various ports in Southeast Asia. Before the founding of the Republic of China, it once sent ships to operate on the China-Japan route. After the Japanese established Nippon Yusen Kaisha (i.e., Toyo Kisen Kaisha), the company's China-Japan route was excluded. The company can be called the largest organization among British shipping companies in China. Since the outbreak of the August 13th Sino-Japanese War, the Yangtze River steamers have been forced to suspend sailing. They have relied on the prosperous business of the Southeast Asia route, and have not actually suffered losses. Because freight rates have repeatedly increased, and since the change to collecting Hong Kong dollars last year, the surplus is even more abundant than before the incident. The company provides Chinese employees with allowances in addition to their salaries. As for the import and export of various ships,

Cargo Loading and Unloading

Crane workers on the ships, in the hold, and on deck are contracted by Wang Asong of Changshun Warehouse and Guo Jiaji of Lianxin Warehouse to hire workers. Yesterday afternoon, around 1:00 PM, a labor dispute suddenly occurred. The workers demanded a wage increase from the contractors but were unsuccessful, so they immediately stopped work and went on strike. The workers gathered in Pudong for a meeting, and the situation was tense. According to the contractors, the workers' representatives verbally demanded an increase of 30% per worker, plus 80 cents for meals. The demanded amount was too far apart, and they were unable to bear it. Moreover, on February 10 of this year, both parties signed an agreement to increase wages by 440 cash, plus 150 cash for night meals, totaling a wage of one yuan and nine cents per worker.

Agreement Contents

Article 2 states that from the date of the treaty, the labor side may not demand a price increase again within six months, no matter how high prices rise. Considering that prices are rising and life is indeed difficult, wages are still paid at the highest price of other wharves in the city, but work must also be done according to the methods of other wharves. It is learned that there is a big difference in the work aspect, and the workers cannot accept it, so they went on strike abruptly. Therefore, from 2:00 PM yesterday, work at the Butterfield & Swire Wharf was completely suspended. The Hunan ship was originally scheduled to leave for Yantai and Tianjin this afternoon, but because no one was loading goods, it is

Feared that it will be difficult to export today

The Yingzhou and Qiongzhou ships, which arrived in Shanghai from South China yesterday afternoon, docked at the company's wharves No. 1 and 2 in the French Concession, but were also unable to unload their cargo. It is heard that the two ships also brought in a large batch of foreign rice. According to general speculation, the above-mentioned disputes may be difficult to resolve for a while. It is heard that after the workers met in Pudong yesterday, they will probably submit a written request to the two contractors, Wang Asong and Guo Jiaji, again today. There are more than 500 workers, but if this is prolonged, ships will not be able to load or unload cargo, delaying the schedule, and the company will suffer huge losses. For the sake of both parties, the company and the contractors should consider it.

Police Protection

Also, it is reported that there are a total of 400 to 500 stevedores at the British firm Butterfield & Swire Wharf in the French Concession. They originally belonged to a contracting system, and the contractors are Wang Asong and Li Shibai. The daily wage for these workers is one yuan and eight cents. Recently, due to the high cost of living, they are unable to maintain their livelihoods. At 12:00 PM yesterday, they went on strike together and elected eight representatives, Zhu Dingxiang, Zhou Guangcai, Sun Kehua, Geng San, Hu Zhaoyang, Yu Jianian, Ding Duzhen, and Lao Wei, to demand a 50% wage increase from the contractors, as well as a daily meal allowance of 80 cents and a night meal allowance of 40 cents, to maintain their livelihoods. The customs water patrol police and the French police were dispatched to protect them separately. The workers are waiting for a reply, while the contractors need to negotiate with the factory again, so it was delayed until the evening and has not been resolved. There are also more than 500 coolies carrying bags, who are also unable to work because there is no one to load or unload. The work of loading and unloading cargo on the three ships Hunan, Qiongzhou, and Yingzhou, which were docked at the wharf, was completely at a standstill yesterday afternoon.

### Member of the Puppet Military Committee, Wen Yingbiao, Shot: Bullet Hit a Vital Point and His Injury is Very Critical: The Two Shooters Escaped Without a Trace

At around 6:00 AM yesterday morning, a shooting incident suddenly occurred at No. 47 Daodeli, Beile Road, in the French Concession. The person shot was Wen Yingbiao, a member of the puppet military committee, who was shot once on the spot, hitting a vital point, and his life is in great danger. The details are recorded as follows:

Holding a Puppet Position: Actually a New Noble

Wen Yingbiao, a native of Guangdong, is 38 years old this year. In his youth, he studied in Austria. He is the nephew of Wen Zongyao, the current president of the puppet legislative yuan of the puppet organization in Jiangning. He is a large man, resembling a brawny man. When Cai Jingjun was the director of the municipal public security bureau, Wen served as an inspector in the inspection department and later rose to the position of director of the foreign affairs section of the department. In the 26th year of the Republic of China, he was transferred to the police station on Wenmiao Road in Nanshi. After the outbreak of the Shanghai War, his attitude suddenly changed. He once held a position in the puppet police station in Pudong. He is currently a member of the puppet military committee. Recently, he was sent to Guangzhou by the puppet regime to serve as the "Principal of the Military Branch School," but has not yet taken office.

Awakened from a Dream: Bullets Suddenly Came

His family resides at No. 47 Daodeli, the intersection of Beile Road and Kaizier Road, in the French Concession, living with his concubine, Ms. Li (22 years old). The night before, Wen and Ms. Li were sleeping together in a small room behind the living room of the house. At around 6:00 AM yesterday morning, two men wearing Western suits suddenly came and knocked on the door, claiming to "visit Mr. Wen Yingbiao." At that time, the maid, Ms. Xu Liu (a native of Jiangbei, 30 years old), opened the door. The men said, "Mr. Wen is not here." Just as the two young men were about to leave, Wen woke up in his sleep, put on his clothes, and went out to check. Unexpectedly, the young men saw him and, without asking any questions, drew their pistols and fired. Wen was caught off guard, and the bullet hit Wen's chest, penetrating his back. Wen fell to the ground after being injured. The maid, Ms. Xu, stood at the door in shock, as if turned to wood. The shooters, seeing that their goal had been achieved, fled out the door and disappeared. When his concubine, Ms. Li, heard the alarm and got up, the shooters had already disappeared.

Sent to the Hospital for Treatment: Life is in Great Danger

She then reported to the French police, who urgently ordered a large number of detectives to rush to the scene. They found Wen lying in a pool of blood at the doorway, barely breathing. Because the Nanyang Hospital was nearby, they borrowed its ambulance and rushed him to Ward No. 214 of the Baolong Hospital for treatment. Because the injury was very serious, his life was in danger. Afterwards, the Daodeli police constable, Zhu Denglu, arrested a suspect in the alley and seized a live ammunition pistol. According to the suspect, Wang Keren (23 years old, a native of Wuxi), the French police are currently investigating.

### Abortion Caused Death: Midwife Arrested Pending Investigation

A Ningbo woman, Gui Xu, residing at No. 324 Jiaxiyi Road in the French Concession, is 24 years old. Her husband works on an ocean-going ship and they have a seven-month-old child. Recently, she suddenly became pregnant again, so at 4:00 PM on the 1st of this month, she went to Gao Amao (also known as Little Old Lady), a Changshu midwife who has a flat in Fangjiazhai, Chengdu Road, to request an abortion. Gao performed the surgery, using a grass root to induce the abortion. Ms. Gui then temporarily resided in a room in the Qinghe Hostel in Qinghefang, Zhejiang Road. On the 2nd, the male fetus in her womb was aborted, but it was already dead, so she discarded it in the chamber pot. Unexpectedly, although the fetus was aborted, Ms. Gui suffered from blood poisoning, causing a serious illness. She then went to the Guangren Hospital for treatment. The doctor confirmed the abortion and reported it to the Chengdu Road police station. Detective Wang Bingtan was dispatched to arrest Gao Amao and take her to the police station. Yesterday morning, she was escorted to the Second Criminal Division of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated the case and requested a postponement. After questioning by Judge Xiao, he ordered her to be detained for seven days pending further investigation.

### Kidnapping of Leather Factory Owner: Two Criminals Arrested: Zhou Xilian and Ni Wenhuan Detained Pending Investigation: Nine Suspects Found Not Guilty and Released

Gu Huanzhang, the owner of the Gongyi Leather Factory at No. 1097 Connaught Road and a native of Nanxiang, was kidnapped by bandits at 10:30 PM on April 8 and hidden somewhere in western Shanghai. They sent a letter demanding a ransom of 35,000 yuan, otherwise his life would be in danger. The words were very intense. Afterwards, Gu's family paid the ransom. They then reported the situation to the Gordon Road police station, which had jurisdiction over the area. After investigation by Chinese detective Wang Chengying and detectives Sun Jianwen and Xu Decheng, the criminals, Zhou Xilian, a local, and Ni Wenhuan, a native of Jiangbei, were arrested along with nine suspects, Qu Liangcai, Qin Zurong, Pan Hongshou, Huang Weichuan, Wang Jiayun, Li Linsen, Huang Yougan, Xiang Guirong, and Sun Wenzhang, at Room No. 1 of the Lao Jinlong Hotel at No. 400 Yuqiaxiang Road. They were taken to the police station and sent to the First Special Court, requesting detention. Qu Liangcai and the other nine hired lawyers Wang Yaotang, Fan Gang, and Yu Enliang to defend them. The court adjourned the hearing for further investigation. During the adjournment, the police found that Qu Liangcai and the others were not actually involved. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Third Criminal Division. Police lawyer Jiang Baolian stated that Zhou Xilian and Ni Wenhuan were being prosecuted for kidnapping and extortion, while the others were found not guilty and requested to be released. Judge Jiang Shuzi briefly questioned the defendants and ordered Zhou and Ni to be remanded in custody. The other nine, Qu Liangcai and the others, were released after the police withdrew the prosecution.

### Comprador of Old Cathay Insurance Department, Chen Shangda, Kidnapped: Gangsters Previously Seized a Yunfei Taxi: Drove Off Towards Western Shanghai After the Kidnapping

A kidnapping case suddenly occurred at Zhangjiazhaikou, Avenyue Edward VII, at around 8:30 AM yesterday. The person kidnapped was Chen Shangda, the comprador of the Old Cathay (康記) Insurance Department in this city. He was forcibly put into a Yunfei taxi and driven off to the west. The details are recorded as follows:

Going to the Office

Chen Shangda, a native of Cixi, Ningbo, is 52 years old. He resides at No. 60, Lane 73, Zhangjiazhaikou, Avenyue Edward VII. He has been working as a comprador for the British firm Old Cathay (康記) Insurance Department at No. 17 Guangdong Road for more than ten years. When Chen was young, he was a trainee in the firm. Because of his diligent work, he was promoted to employee and then to comprador. He currently goes in and out in taxi No. 1799, driven by Pei Shisong (37 years old, a native of Jiangbei). Yesterday morning, around 8:30 AM,

Set off to the office. He was pulled out of Zhangjiazhaikou to the entrance of the Youhua Taxi Company, when a Yunfei taxi No. 12344, which had been seized by bandits, was parked on the side of the road. Seeing Chen's taxi approaching, the gangsters in the car also started the engine and moved slowly. The two cars were side by side.

Forcibly Boarded the Car

Unexpectedly, when the car reached the intersection of Avenyue Edward VII, two gangsters suddenly flashed out from the right side of the road and used their hands to block the taxi's bumper. Another person wearing a long robe on the left side showed a pistol, slapped the taxi driver Pei Shisong, and threatened him to stop. Pei, intimidated by the threat, put down the bumper and stood aside in a daze. One of the bandits kicked him and told him to leave quickly. Then, Chen was dragged out of the taxi, forcibly put into taxi No. 12344, and driven off to the west.

Bandits Disappeared

After the incident, taxi driver Pei Shisong rushed back to his home and reported the information to his family, who then reported it to the Xinzha Police Station, which dispatched a large number of Chinese and Western detectives to rush to the scene. However, the bandits had disappeared without a trace. The police are currently investigating. It is learned that before the January 28th Incident, Chen lived near the early bridge in Zhabei. He then moved to that place. He has seven children, and the youngest is still in swaddling clothes. Because he has a large family to feed, he has no savings. It is heard that Chen earns a salary of 300 yuan a month, which is just a nominal amount, with no real substance.

Robbery of the Car

It is also learned that at around 6:30 AM yesterday morning, a customer suddenly came to the Yunfei Taxi Branch on Jing'an Temple Road. The taxi driver, Tan Maodi (48 years old, local), drove taxi No. 12344 to the entrance of the Qingnian Primary School Alley in Fanwangdu. The customer ordered the car to turn around and stop, and told him to go into the alley with him to retrieve a box. Tan did not suspect anything and followed him inside. Unexpectedly, before he had gone far, four men in short clothes suddenly emerged from the alley. Two of them were holding weapons and forbade him to shout. They then stripped off his uniform and another bandit put it on.

Returned Afterwards

Coincidentally, behind that place was the Zhaofeng Garden. Three people were monitoring him and escorted him around the garden. The other two drove the car away. More than two and a half hours later, the car returned to its original location. After meeting the three bandits in the garden, they said to the taxi driver that the car was on Dunxin Road, and he could go and drive it back. At this time, Tan broke free and rushed to that place. He indeed saw the original car parked there, so he drove it back to the taxi company and immediately reported the situation to the police station. It has been confirmed that the car was used by the bandits to kidnap Chen Shangda.

### Hidden Opium Within Soap

Central Police Narcotics Department detective Liu Zhaonian received a tip from an informant stating that a drug trafficker would be passing by the intersection of Machen Road and Wuding Road around 7:30 AM yesterday, carrying a large quantity of opium. He, along with detective chief Ye Yusi, detectives Guo Shouxin, and Wang Shusen, went to the location on time to stake out the area. They saw Yao Baoxing, a man from Qingpu, carrying two large bars of soap, approaching. His demeanor seemed suspicious, so they arrested him. Inside the specially made soap, they found twenty-eight taels of opium, worth over a thousand yuan. He was taken to the Xinzha precinct for detention, pending transfer to the First Special Court for interrogation.

### Old Copper and Tin Industry Guild Requests the Abolition of Illegal Fees

The Old Copper and Tin Industry Guild of this city recently noted that its members are facing extreme difficulties in making a living. Therefore, the standing committee members Lü Deyou, Chen Wenmai, and Wang Hanqing convened a meeting of supervisors and directors. They decided to abolish all "illegal fees," in order to rectify industry practices and ease the burden on members. They submitted a document to the authorities of the two concessions yesterday, requesting approval for the record and formally abolishing the illegal fees. At the same time, all members were notified to comply with the implementation.

### Lost Savings Passbook

A ten-year fixed savings passbook from the Four Banks Joint Savings Society was found yesterday afternoon on Nanjing Road, without any specimen signature. Payment can be made upon presentation of the passbook. The loser, if they can state the account holder's name, the amount, and the maturity date, can claim the passbook from Mr. Bo Shude of the towel department at the China National Goods Company.

### Letter to the Editor

To the Editor:

With utmost respect, we read in your newspaper's local news column of June 5th the statement that "The company's workers demanded a 30% wage increase, which was rejected by the factory, and the factory gates were closed, preventing workers from entering to work," which greatly surprised us. Upon investigation, we found that at noon on the 5th, three workers, Chen Wenyuan, Xu Dinggao, and Wang Yizhen, coerced all the workers into going on strike. After investigation by the factory, the three workers were dismissed. At the same time, the remaining workers resumed normal work. The three workers then resorted to violence, intimidating other workers and preventing them from working, and coercing the factory manager to increase wages by 30%. Such unreasonable behavior disrupted work, and we reported this to the Chengdu Road Police Station, requesting protection. The three workers then left. In summary, the facts are significantly different from what was reported. Accordingly, we request a correction. Respectfully, The Editorial Department of Shen Bao, China Yilin Color Printing Co., Ltd., June 6th.

### Weather Report

The Xujiahui Observatory issued a weather forecast at 4:30 PM yesterday, stating that Shandong and surrounding areas are clear with fog, and strong southwest to northwest winds. Here and in the East China Sea, it is cloudy with morning fog and no prevailing wind direction. There is rainfall in South China. Also, in the 24 hours before 3:00 PM yesterday, the highest temperature in this city was 80.1 degrees, and the lowest was 65.7 degrees. There are no records for the same day last year.

### Recent Events at West Lake

West Lake in Hangzhou, also known as Xizi Lake and Golden Ox Lake, is renowned both domestically and internationally for its beautiful scenery. The Three Pools Mirroring the Moon is one of the ten scenic spots, with its pavilions and waterside gazebos, green railings and red balustrades, surrounded by lotus ponds and connected by small bridges, making it a prime location for escaping the summer heat. After the ravages of war, the former Governor of Hunan, Lord Xiangxiang, Jiang, oversaw its reconstruction, making it even grander than before. To the east of this location, leading in through a small bridge, is the Tuixing Hermitage, which is the villa of Grand Tutor Peng Xueqin. During breaks from inspecting the river and reviewing military affairs, the Grand Tutor would always spend a month or so here. He had previously requested permission from the court to use it as a place to recuperate, like He Jizhen's Jian Lake. At that time, Yu Yinfu of Deqing, the former Education Commissioner of Henan, was in charge of the Bo Gu Jing 精舍 Academy. The students of the academy pooled money and hired workers to build the Yu Building to the east of the academy, as a place for the commissioner to rest when he came to the province. It was completed last winter. The commissioner went to Hangzhou last month to start teaching and, at the request of his disciples, set up his bed there. The building is located with its back to the mountain and facing the water, with the entire lake in view, fully showcasing the beauty of the lake. The Grand Tutor, who was recuperating at the Tuixing Hermitage, was delighted to hear of the commissioner's arrival and happily rowed over. The commissioner also visited the Grand Tutor from time to time. The two locations are only separated by the Su Causeway, making it easy to travel back and forth. Those who admire them say that the Gods of Literature and Talent are gazing at each other across the water, truly like the Northern and Southern Peaks standing side by side. The Grand Tutor departed on the 23rd of last month, and the commissioner also returned to Suzhou on the same day.

### Saving Life (2)

However, we must understand that Christ never said that all worldly things are inherently bad. He did not condemn people for having families, love, happiness, art, beauty, science, knowledge, and all other activities related to life. Nor did he command people to reject all these activities. Instead, he told us that if people make these things the greatest purpose of their lives, they will lose them all. Conversely, if people are not enslaved by these things, but are willing to lose them all for the sake of Christ and his blessings, they can save them. This is truly an unbreakable truth. Someone once said, "I am a Christian because being a Christian is very interesting." This is true. Ordinary irreligious people see life as boring, but it is not life that is so, but rather that they are indulging in alcohol, sex, movies, and dancing, losing their lives, so they see life as boring. Christians are not like that. They see life as very interesting because they believe that the results of their actions will not end with their own lives, but will affect future generations. They see their own lives as a drama, with God and angels as the audience. When they perform well, God is pleased for them, and when they perform poorly, God is sad for them. They see all their activities as having a noble meaning. They offer art and beauty to God for praise and worship. They see knowledge and science as proof of God's great wisdom and power. They see God as the source of love, light, truth, power, and life, so their outlook on life is full of interest. In short, what Christ said has an unbreakable truth. If we seek entertainment etc. for our own sake, we will not only fail to obtain the true happiness of entertainment, but will also suffer mental pain and lose our original life. If we sacrifice our happiness for the sake of righteousness, we will not only save all that we originally had, but also gain new interests, new happiness, new hope—new life. (The End)

### Telephone Shortage

— Previous Experience

Because the demand for telephones exceeds the supply, a new business of "selling telephone subscriptions" has emerged, with each subscription costing as much as two or three thousand yuan. Although the telephone company authorities have published advertisements, to strictly prohibit this practice, it is all done privately, making it impossible to prevent, and leading to even worse malpractices. Because after the buyer and seller have reached a deal, the "relocation" of the telephone still has to go through the company's procedures, even the original subscriber is extorted for huge sums of money when moving and having the telephone removed. Yesterday's local news column in this newspaper contained a report on a case of extortion that was cracked, in which most of the defendants were employees of the company.

Privately selling telephone subscriptions violates the telephone company's regulations, and the telephone company's employees are taking advantage of this weakness to extort money. This is not only "deception and extortion" but also "aiding and abetting the wicked," because the telephone company's inability to prohibit "selling telephone subscriptions" is probably due to problems with the "relocation" procedure. In the future, the company authorities only need to pay attention to investigate when someone requests to move or remove a telephone, to determine whether it is the "original subscriber's telephone" or a "telephone subscription that has been sold," which would be much more effective than publishing advertisements.

At the same time, the author also thought of another problem, which is that new telephone equipment will soon arrive in Shanghai. It is said that once the telephone lines are fully equipped, new telephones can be installed within the year. However, according to a friend who requested to have a telephone installed and went to register, the number of registered users may exceed the number of new telephones, so the company should investigate the order of registration in advance (the receipt has a number) and proceed accordingly. Otherwise, the "first installation" and "later installation" will still give unscrupulous people the opportunity to profit from it.

### Protect Library Books

— New Dream

A few days ago, I read a notice from the New Asia Library in this newspaper, which stated in essence that the books borrowed from the library recently have often been found to be damaged, such as having pages torn out or having arbitrary comments written on them, making it impossible to prevent. This is indeed a heartbreaking thing.

Not only the New Asia Library, we know that similar things happen in general libraries, especially in school libraries. As soon as the newspapers arrive, the reviews are cut out, and a hole is cut out of the supplement. In less than half a day, a newspaper is torn to pieces, with little left. Although this is for personal preferences and the need to clip and store them, do not forget that the library is public and cannot be cut off for your own private use, making it impossible for others to read it. Other things, such as borrowing books and not returning them, and writing words and sentences on books, are also often discovered.

Public property should be cherished by everyone, especially the books and newspapers in the library, and should not be arbitrarily damaged in the slightest, so that everyone can see them. Therefore, the author hopes that everyone who goes to the library or borrows books from the library can cherish the books and newspapers even more than their own books and newspapers. Because if your own books and newspapers are damaged, only you will be affected and harmed, but if the books and newspapers in the library are damaged, countless people will be affected and harmed. Everyone should get rid of this bad habit!

### Scolding "Dai" and Teaching Theft

— Chen Lin

Dear Sir:

At around nine o'clock this morning, I had an important matter to attend to in the Eight Immortals Bridge area. While passing through the intersection of Mintiniyin Road and Ningbo Road, I saw a woman wearing a silk Indian cheongsam, with her hair permed and wearing high-heeled leather shoes. She was holding the hand of a boy of eight or nine years old, and behind them were two men in their twenties. One was wearing a Mandarin gown, and the other was wearing a beige suit. Both were wearing felt hats and leather shoes. As the woman approached the turning point, I suddenly saw the two men pounce on her, one holding down her throat and right hand, and the other snatching the diamond ring and watch from her left hand. Then they pushed the woman to the ground and fled westward. The woman got up from the ground and shouted to catch the thieves, but the thieves had already disappeared. The boy stood there crying blankly. The onlookers crowded around to watch the excitement, and I left amidst the noise.

I would like to advise the ladies and gentlemen of Shanghai that there are many thieves in the city now, and people are being robbed even on the streets during the day. We can only be frugal and simple, and not lose our belongings for the sake of beauty and showing off, and also be frightened. Do you think it's worth it?

Hawthorne's Case

### The Ballerina's Ending

— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter One: "A Very Pretty Lady!"

Anna also said, "Mr. Hawthorne, if you can catch the murderer, I am willing to reward you handsomely. I heard that you are an omnipotent detective!"

Hawthorne hurriedly returned his head to a normal state. "What are you talking about!—Omnipotent? Who is omnipotent? Sorry, I can't stand it." Hawthorne shook his head repeatedly, an uncomfortable look on his face, still exhaling from his cigarette.

Hawthorne never liked unreasonable flattery, let alone the word "omnipotent," which exceeded the limit of flattery.

Anna said in a trembling voice, "Mr. Hawthorne, Lilan died miserably and very strangely. Even if you don't do it for the reward, you must put some effort into finding out the truth of this case for the tragic death of a poor woman."

Her voice was almost begging. Moreover, the word "strange" also touched Hawthorne's curiosity.

Hawthorne said seriously, "Okay, I'll take a look. Where is she?"

"She died at her home at No. 27 Qingpu Road. She originally had no relatives at home... There is currently an uncle-in-law, named Li Zhiban."

"Did this uncle-in-law tell you?"

"No, Jinmei called me—Jinmei is Lilan's maid. As soon as I received her call, I rushed over. She died so tragically!"

Hawthorne sat up straight, held the cigarette between two fingers, and looked at me, as if hinting that if I intended to go with him, I had to change my clothes immediately. I felt that there was no need to say goodbye to this Jiang Anna, so I walked out of the office door to the upstairs. As I was going up the stairs, I heard Anna speaking again. (7)

### General Review of the Five Classes of Talent at Fuliancheng (1)

— Only Me

Preamble: The Ke Ban Opera School in Beiping is the only Peking Opera actor training institute in China. Almost all of today's famous performers were trained by Fuliancheng. However, in the past two or three decades, among the performers who have come out of Fuliancheng and become leading actors, from the Xi generation to the Shi generation, there has only been one person in each class: Xi generation: Tan Xinxi; Lian generation: Ma Lianliang; Fu generation: Tan Fuying; Sheng generation: Li Shenghao; and Shi generation: Mao Shilai. Coincidentally, four out of these five people sing Lao Sheng roles (old male roles), and only Mao Shilai, the Shi generation, is a Dan role (female role).

According to current surveys, only Xu Xifu, Hou Xi , and Chen Xixing, remain active among the first Xi generation of Fuliancheng graduates. The number of Lian and Dang generation graduates is also declining. The Sheng and Shi generations are the most widely dispersed. The Sheng generation, led by Li Shenghao, performed in Shanghai after graduation, leaving a deep impression on Shanghai audiences. The Shi generation graduated recently, and few have come to Shanghai. Therefore, Shanghai residents may not be familiar with them. Here is a summary of the talent produced by this class:

Sheng Role (Male Role): The Shi generation produced the most talent in Xusheng (bearded male) roles. Li Shilin is the oldest and earliest to emerge among them. Li Shilin switched to Yinglizi (clown) roles soon after learning opera. (This person came to Shanghai last year with Wang Yurong.) Later, Liu Shixun, Yu Shilong, and Wang Shixu performed formal Laosheng opera at Hehelou (a theater where Fuliancheng performers played). These three were all skilled during their training, and people predicted that they would become the next Ma (Lianliang) and Tan (Fuying). In particular, Shixun and Shilong were skilled in singing, reciting, acting, and performance. However, unexpectedly, these three suddenly had voice problems before graduating, which resulted in failing before success and never becoming famous. To this day, their voices have not recovered, so they all stay at home in Beiping. After Liu Shixun and others had voice problems, Sha Shixin, Ye Shichang, and Chi Shigong replaced them. Although these three seemed to replace Liu, Yu, and Wang at the time, only Sha Shixin was actually popular. Ye Shichang and Chi Shigong were both very reluctant. After graduation, Shixin first joined a major troupe and came south to cooperate with Mao Shilai. Unexpectedly, he failed to make a name for himself in Shanghai. As a result of the circumstances, Chi Shigong and Ye Shichang surpassed Shixin. In terms of art, Shigong is currently the best (he is currently working with Song Dezhu and Gou Lingxiang). Shichang learns from Ma Lianliang and excels in acting and body movements. His voice is not very loud. However, as Shichang is a junior figure in Fuliancheng, his future may be better than that of Shigong. Li Shiqi, who is currently performing on stage, originally studied martial Laosheng roles but later switched to Yinglizi roles and is a promising talent. In addition, there is also Li Shizhang, who is also a Yinglizi Laosheng. All the Yinglizi Laosheng produced by the Shi generation are named Li (Shilin, Shiqi, Shizhang), which often confuses people. It is also a coincidence. As for Wusheng (martial male) roles in the Shi generation, there is a great lack of talent. During their training, there were only Jiang Shisheng and Gao Shishou. Gao Shishou is the son of Gao Qingkui and was also a promising talent, but unfortunately, he did not strive to improve, so he gave up halfway. Now he has been reduced to a second-rate Wusheng. (Shishou is currently with his elder brother Shenglin and has come south with Shenglin several times.) Jiang Shisheng is quite skilled and excels in short-fighting plays. Although he has graduated, he has not yet joined a troupe. Because there is a lack of Wusheng talent in Fuliancheng's Shi generation, Shisheng is regarded as a rare gem. As for Xiaosheng (young male) roles, Jiang Shiyu is one of the best. Although his skill is difficult to compare with that of Ye Shengzhu, he is also a rare talent. There is also Zhang Shixiao (who came to Shanghai with Xu Yingwen before but failed to attract attention). He originally played Dan roles but later switched to Xiaosheng roles. After Jiang Shiyu graduated, Shixiao replaced Shiyu in performing Xiaosheng operas. His skill is acceptable. In addition, there is Zhu Shifen, who is only mediocre.

### Peking Opera at the Hualian Tongle Society

— Planned Success

The Hualian Tongle Society aims to connect feelings, study art, cultivate the mind and body, improve life, and promote proper entertainment. Yesterday, the society held its fourth membership drive, with hundreds of people attending. After Mr. Yuan Ludeng reported the purpose of the meeting, members of the society's Peking Opera group performed three Peking Opera excerpts to add to the enjoyment. On the stage, there were two black-letter banners on red satin, one saying "Music Plays Jun Tian," and the other saying "Music Corrects Righteousness and Values Weight." There were also couplets that read, "Depicting the past, hoping to use joy and sorrow to encourage loyalty and filial piety"; "Singing heroically, daring to say that entertainment forgets worries and danger!" They were donated by Mr. Chen Lianzhang. The first excerpt was *Hong Bi Xi*. It started with the scene where she begged in the snow and ended with the beating in the bridal chamber. Ms. Cheng Zizhen played Jin Yu Nu. Her appearance was beautiful, and her voice was sweet and smooth. When she opened the door and saw her father lying in the snow, she felt pity for his suffering and asked him to enter the house and gave him leftover food. Soon, she heard him talk about his life. She admired his talent and hoped to marry him, but she was too shy to say so. She perfectly depicted the mentality of a young girl and can be said to have acted with great expression. Later, in the second bridal chamber scene, she recounted her husband's past misdeeds. She was righteous and strict. When she spoke of where his conscience was, she gritted her teeth and was extremely resentful. The audience was moved by her performance and thought that it was too cheap to only punish him with a beating. Shi Guangyu's Mo Ji was excellent in both singing and acting, which enhanced the performance. The second excerpt was *Begging for Fishing Tax and Killing the Family*. Ying Wenyuan's Xiao En was skilled and experienced. Li Yaozu's Guiying was innocent and lively. Shen Juemin's teacher was ridiculous and funny. All of them were equally skilled and wonderful. The third excerpt was *The Drunken Concubine*. Zhai Zhibi played the Concubine Yang. She was dignified and gorgeous. Her body movements were like a willow in the wind, floating like a fairy, making people dizzy. When she teased the eunuch, her eyes were blurred with drunkenness, which was also acted appropriately. It is rare to find such talent among amateur performers. Therefore, the applause was thunderous, and the gongs stopped at midnight.

### Theater News

— Xia

Since its establishment, the Lido Drama Society, under the leadership of President Gao Hang, has been actively preparing for its trial performance. The society's actors are mostly basic actors from the Guohua and Minhua film companies, and the lineup is quite strong. It is rumored that they will perform in a major theater in this city in mid-July.

### New Four Thousand Golds

— Xing

Guohua's new work

After completing *Black Paradise*, Wu Cun intends to continue developing fashion films. It is rumored that he has decided that his next new work will be *New Four Thousand Golds*. Zhou Xuan and Zhou Manhua have been tentatively selected as the main actors. Wu Cun had previously directed the film *Four Thousand Golds* before the war, starring Bai Yang, Gong Qiuxia, Shu Xiuwen, and Huang Naishuang. The tone was light and cheerful, reminiscent of Hollywood works.

### Shanghai Theater Arts Society: Searching for Scripts, Cao Yu Sent One

After *Thunderstorm*, *Sunrise*, and *Wilderness*, Cao Yu's new work *Metamorphosis* has been sent to Shanghai. This new work will undoubtedly be enthusiastically supported by Shanghai audiences. In addition, Zhang Junxiang, who recently returned from studying drama in the United States, also sent a script called *The Story of a Small City*, which is his friend's masterpiece and a very excellent script. In addition, playwrights from the mainland have all sent letters to the Shanghai Theater Arts Society, promising to submit scripts within a short period of time. On the other hand, to encourage new writers, the society is establishing a script prize to welcome external submissions (the society's basic and special playwrights are not allowed to participate). The prizes are set at 500 yuan, 300 yuan, and 200 yuan. There will definitely be a lot of submissions in this area. In addition, technical personnel and actors are being sought from all over.

### Gone with the Wind (Part 2)

— Yao Senyuan

"Gone With the Wind" by Margaret Mitchell

One day, Scarlett's father came home and said that Ashley and Melanie would announce their engagement tomorrow at Twelve Oaks Plantation. Upon hearing this, she felt deeply distressed. She hadn't expected this news to actually become a reality. She thought there must be a reason, surely because she hadn't expressed her love for him. Moreover, she often treated him with a "touch-me-not" attitude. Naturally, he would marry Melanie out of disappointment. So, she planned to come up with a way to prevent them from getting engaged tomorrow, and thus didn't sleep all night. The next day, she went with her parents and two younger sisters to Twelve Oaks, where she met Melanie's brother Charles Hamilton's fiancée, Frank, and Rhett Butler, among others. These were many of the people she didn't want to associate with, because she was eagerly looking for Ashley. She searched for a long time, but couldn't find him. Later, she met Charles, who told her that the Civil War was about to break out and Lincoln was recruiting soldiers. He spoke excitedly, but he didn't know that Scarlett wasn't interested in the slightest. Suddenly, Charles proposed to Scarlett. This sudden proposal left her speechless for a moment. Later, she met Ashley and expressed her love for him, wanting to marry him. But by this time, Ashley had already decided to marry Melanie. Disappointed, Scarlett decided to marry Charles, partly because he was Melanie's brother, so she could directly take revenge on Melanie, and partly because Melanie's cousin, Honey, was also in love with Charles, so marrying him would also disappoint Honey.

Scarlett married Charles in two weeks. Two months later, Scarlett became a widow, because after they got married, the Civil War immediately broke out, and many young men were drafted into the war. Charles and Ashley were naturally no exception, but Charles unfortunately died in battle, while Ashley was still fighting. Soon after, Scarlett gave birth to a son named Wade. She lived with Melanie at Twelve Oaks and gradually became very good sisters, because Melanie treated Scarlett even more warmly after Charles's death.

One day, at a dance to raise funds for the hospital, Scarlett met Rhett Butler. They had met when Ashley and Melanie were engaged, and Rhett had fallen in love with Scarlett at first sight, but he had never expressed it. Now, by chance, they met here, and he thought he would definitely be able to achieve his goal. Therefore, he immediately donated one hundred and fifty dollars in Scarlett's name to win her favor. Now, Rhett was very successful and relied on his courage to carry out commercial speculation in the blockade area, thus raising prices and making huge profits. Since he met Scarlett this time, he often came to see her and brought many gifts. He proposed to her several times, but Scarlett rejected him, because the only person she truly loved in the world was Ashley.
