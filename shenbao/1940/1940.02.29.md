### Great Victory for the Eastern Henan Army in Xinyang; Japanese Army Suffers Crushing Defeat Attempting to Invade Luoshan Along the Highway; Battle Situation on Yongbin Road in Southern Guangxi Calms Down Yesterday

Nanyang: The Japanese army in Dongwulidian, Xinyang, successively reinforced their troops on the 24th and 25th, committing arson and murder everywhere. Taking advantage of the mass escape of civilians, they advanced towards the county seat of Luoshan along the highway. After fierce resistance by the Chinese army, the Japanese suffered heavy casualties but continued to reinforce and advance south. On the night of the 25th, the Chinese army heavily surrounded the Japanese army in the vicinity of Luoshan, inflicting a crushing blow and launching a fierce attack on the Japanese flanks. The Japanese army retreated step by step, and the Chinese army pursued and annihilated them at every turn. That night, the Japanese army near Luoshan was completely cleared. At the same time, a unit of the Chinese army suddenly attacked Zhongshanpu, destroying the Xin-Luo Highway to prevent the Japanese army from retreating, and closely coordinated with the Chinese army advancing from the west of Luoshan, launching a pincer attack to annihilate the Japanese.

Editorial

### An Analysis of the Recent Japanese Economy

Yesterday's editorial in this newspaper discussed the material foundation of modern warfare, emphasizing three key elements: weaponry, manpower, and the economy. It also generally discussed the issue of manpower in Japan's war of aggression against China. Now, we will further examine Japan's combat capabilities from an economic perspective.

Recently, the press in various European and American countries has written extensively analyzing the socio-economic situation in Japan, and they have almost unanimously concluded that Japanese society is in a state of unrest, and that the economic situation is deteriorating. This widespread view should not be regarded as containing any political agenda or as malicious propaganda, as each must have its own sources of information as the basis for its arguments. A few days ago, Sir Victor Sassoon, a British expatriate, made similar remarks to reporters in New York, which were immediately met with displeasure from Japanese officials. Could it be that Sir Victor Sassoon's words struck a nerve with Japan? Otherwise, why would they be so resentful?

Facts speak louder than words. Japan's predicament cannot be hidden by empty words, nor can it be glossed over by fabricating any grand figures. First, let's look at the financial aspect: Japan's budget for this year (from April 1st of last year to the end of March this year) is 9.4 billion yen, and it will increase to 10.3 billion yen next year. How can such a large budget be balanced? The sources of revenue are no more than three methods: increasing taxes, issuing public bonds, and inflating the currency. According to a survey by the Mitsubishi Economic Research Institute, under these three methods, the Japanese government's deficit reached 970 million yen by the end of last year. The situation is the same this year, and the budget for next year is even larger, so the difficulty will be even greater, and the deficit will inevitably be even larger. Will taxes be increased? The current situation is already like draining a pond to catch all the fish, and increasing taxes may not even increase revenue. Will public bonds continue to be issued? The amount set for this year is 5.6 billion yen, and for next year it is 5.7 billion yen. In terms of the actual amount issued, a total of 4.1 billion yen was issued from April to December of last year, an average of 460 million yen per month, which is nine times more than in the previous three years. If we add up the amount of public bonds issued by Japan over the years, plus the budgeted amount for next year, it will exceed 30 billion yen. With a population of 70 million, each person must bear 400 yen. What kind of phenomenon is this?

Although these public bonds are said to be issued, they are mostly hoarded in bank vaults. Recently, Japan even plans to issue small-denomination public bonds in the form of lotteries, which shows the weakness of the public's ability to absorb public bonds. Then, will the currency be inflated further? Japanese economists have long issued warnings about malignant inflation. The total amount of banknotes issued by the Bank of Japan at the end of last year reached 3 billion yen, which is more than double what it was three years ago. In addition, there are other banknotes and small-denomination banknotes issued by other banks outside the Japanese mainland, which are not included in the calculation. It is not only that inflation is malignant and that malignancy is a problem, but also that the value of the currency has actually fallen sharply. Although the value of the yen in foreign exchange has fallen only slightly on the surface in the past two years, it is actually very different from what it used to be. Just look at how it uses political and military power to support its currency war against China in the occupied areas, where it can do whatever it wants. However, the exchange rate of the yen on the black market fully exposes the fact that the Japanese government can no longer maintain its legal standard. According to reliable information obtained from the United States, Japan's gold reserves are about to run out, and the international value of the yen may inevitably undergo drastic changes in the near future. This unprecedentedly large budget proposal in Japan was actually approved in the House of Representatives without a word. Is it because Japanese authorities and legislators have a firm grasp of the implementation of the budget and are confident that there will be no problems? Or is there some unfathomable profundity in the ambiguous answers and explanations made by the finance officials? It is because everyone has a deep understanding and knows that opposing and not opposing are equally ineffective in practice, so they are perfunctorily going through the process of deliberation.

Furthermore, in terms of the general economic situation, there are those in Japan who have issued warnings to the government. At the same time, there are also self-deceiving and optimistic views, saying that the improvement in foreign trade is a sign of hope. Indeed, last year Japan's exports were worth 3.5 billion yen and imports were worth 2.8 billion yen, resulting in a trade surplus of 600 million yen in terms of value. But analyzing its contents, last year's large Japanese trade surplus was actually obtained from trade within the so-called "Yen Bloc," as for trade with European and American countries, not only was there no trade surplus, but there was a trade deficit of 400 million yen. The cost of secret imports of military supplies is not even included in this figure. According to the analysis of Japanese economic researchers, the trade surplus with the so-called "Yen Bloc" last year was due to the so-called reconstruction of North and South China and the construction of Manchukuo, which required a large amount of machinery and raw materials. The matters within that scope, rather than being considered trade, can be regarded as moving things around, and fundamentally do not have the value of general trade. It may be said that it is not only useless to the current Japanese national economy, but also harmful. Looking at the recent sudden announcement by the Japanese government that industry in China can no longer rely solely on Japanese raw materials, one can get a glimpse of the advantages and disadvantages of the situation.

As for the activities of industry, commerce, and agriculture in Japan, it is naturally not easy to find any changes and flaws under the strong control of the government, but it is not without clues to be found. For example, industrial production is estimated to have decreased by 6.4% in September of last year compared to the same period of the previous year. Mining increased by about 5%, while manufacturing decreased by 8%. In manufacturing, heavy industry increased by 15%, electricity and gas increased by 8%, while other industries such as textiles and chemicals decreased. In fact, this is not entirely the case. The coal and electricity shortages in recent months have caused major panic in the industrial sector, which will inevitably directly affect various types of production. While the military industry, which is trending towards development, can superficially support a part of the national livelihood, it is fundamentally only a target for the war of attrition in China and is not a productive industry. Regarding commerce, the government announced that bank deposits have increased to 25 billion yen last year, and that prices have not changed much, increasing by only 15% compared to the previous year. However, the reason for the increase in deposits is half due to forced absorption and half due to currency inflation. As for the small increase in prices, it is based on the official prices set by the government. Various important items all have their black market prices. The Japanese government announced that the number of illegal transactions discovered last year increased sevenfold compared to the previous year, which shows how chaotic the internal affairs of Japanese commerce are. As for agriculture, according to agricultural statistics, production increased significantly last year. The Japanese Minister of Agriculture previously publicly reported that the rice harvest last year was 69 million dan, which was larger than the budgeted number and increased by 4.6% compared to the previous year. Is this credible? Why does the opposite of the historical phenomenon actually occur, and riots occur due to the rice shortage? Why did the Abe Cabinet collapse due to the rice problem? Can paper numbers eliminate the seriousness of the facts? In short, observing from any aspect, the cracks in the Japanese economy are all visible.

Modern nations, whether in peacetime or wartime, cannot be completely self-sufficient. In peacetime, international economic exchanges can promote the economic prosperity of both countries. In wartime, international economic assistance is an important factor in determining victory. Japan cannot support itself domestically, and there is no international assistance. Therefore, we can predict the future of the Sino-Japanese War!

### Japanese Army in Jiangmen and Xinhui Repeatedly Ambushed by Chinese Army; Japanese Reinforcements Ambushed, Suffering Heavy Casualties; Remnants Retreat Along Xinhe Highway

Zhaoqing: The Japanese troops trapped in Jiangmen and Xinhui have been repeatedly ambushed by the Chinese army recently, causing extreme panic. On the night of the 24th, several hundred Japanese troops were dispatched from Jiujiang to reinforce them but were ambushed by the Chinese army on Gangzhou Road, suffering heavy casualties. Their remnants fled along the Xinhe Road, only to be ambushed again by the Chinese army near Maowu. They then retreated back along their original route. (27th dispatch)

Wengyuan: On the night of the 23rd, taking advantage of the dim moonlight, the Chinese army launched a surprise attack on Xihu Chashan, Dongguan County. The Japanese army did not dare to engage in battle and immediately fled.

### American Ambassador to Arrive in Chongqing Today

Chongqing: American Ambassador Johnson will arrive here tomorrow, which is attracting widespread attention. This is not only because the ambassador is undertaking a special mission, but more importantly because the ambassador recently traveled to Beijing, Tianjin, Hankou, Shanghai, and Guangzhou, and traveled along the Yangtze River to and from Hankou on an American gunboat. He also traveled by car along the newly built Yunnan-Sichuan Highway. According to American highway experts, this highway is the best in southwestern China. People from all walks of life here are eager to learn about the American ambassador's impressions of his travels. However, the ambassador is known for his discretion and does not easily speak out when interviewed by reporters. Therefore, it is expected that the ambassador will not say much when meeting guests in order to satisfy public expectations. When the ambassador left Chongqing, the US government terminated the US-Japan commercial treaty, which gave the United States a new and important position in the future development of the situation in the Far East. Therefore, there is special concern here about the ambassador's arrival in Chongqing this time. After the ambassador arrives, the number of foreign ambassadors in Chongqing will increase to four, making it the largest gathering of foreign diplomats in China's wartime capital. In addition to the US ambassador, the current ambassadors stationed here include British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, French Ambassador Cosme, and Soviet Ambassador Pan Youxin. The Soviet ambassador has never left Chongqing since presenting his credentials last year, and the British and French ambassadors have also been in Chongqing for nearly two months. Other foreign diplomats in Chongqing include representatives from the Italian, Belgian, Dutch legations. The staff of the British Embassy in Chongqing include the leader of the British diplomatic mission, Mr. Broadmead, and Air Attaché Captain Aitken. In addition, Deputy Military Attaché Captain Miller is also coming to Chongqing from Shanghai and will likely be stationed here for a long time. (Reuters, 28th dispatch)

### Tianjin Concession Authorities Restrict Flour Prices

Tianjin: The flour shortage in Tianjin is becoming increasingly acute. The authorities recently imported over one million bags of flour from Australia and Japan, but the average monthly consumption in Tianjin is one million bags for every 300,000 households, so it is still a drop in the bucket. At the same time, flour prices are rising endlessly. Although the US government has increased the subsidy for flour exports from 15 cents (US dollars) per barrel to 1.40 dollars (US dollars), the price of flour in Tianjin has not decreased. The reasons for this are nothing more than two: one is the fall in the local currency's value, and the other is the continuous rise in flour prices on the world market after the outbreak of the European war. In addition, since the "Provisional Government" in Beijing implemented exchange controls, the export of goods from North China to countries outside the Yen Bloc has decreased daily, and the source of goods from the interior has been cut off due to transportation difficulties. As a result, foreign currencies are becoming increasingly scarce, which is also related to the rise in flour prices. The British and French concession authorities, in view of the increasingly severe "flour shortage," which has now risen to a peak of 20 yuan per bag, have taken various measures to crack down on speculators. The French concession authorities have ordered all grain merchants in the concession to sell flour at a limited price of 15 yuan per bag. The British concession's Public Works Department has ordered all merchants to register their flour stocks and implement various emergency control measures. As a result, flour prices in the concession have fallen to 15.50 yuan. Although flour robberies have recently occurred in the Chinese area, there have been no such incidents in the British and French concessions, which must be attributed to the concession authorities' effective handling of the situation.

### Gao Tao Also Discloses: The Contents of the Liang-Japan Secret Agreements; Previously Acknowledged One by One by Wang Jingwei; Japanese Side Exclusively Occupies Central China Resources

Chongqing. Gao Zongwu and Tao Xisheng yesterday continued to mail to this newspaper the full text of various secret agreements and contracts successively signed by Liang Hongzhi and others of the Nanjing puppet organization with the Japanese side. They also stated that before Wang Jingwei signed the (Japan-Wang Secret Agreement), the original text of each of these agreements and contracts was sent to Wang by the Japanese special affairs organs, and after he acknowledged them one by one, the second item of the so-called (Essentials for the Adjustment of New Japan-China Relations) stipulated, (Acknowledging the existing facts before the restoration of new national relations during the Incident.) The third item of the (Principles for Adjusting the New Japan-China Relations) stipulated that an (economically strong Japan-China combined zone) should be established in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River region. The various secret agreements and contracts signed by Liang were regarded by Japan as (existing facts). The various secret agreements and contracts were specific plans to promote the (economically strong combined zone in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River region). These included the resources, mining, railways, aviation, telegraph, telephone, water and electricity, and urban construction of Central China. According to their methods, they not only had exclusivity but also profound xenophobia; they not only had deceptive characteristics but also obvious plundering characteristics; they not only had economic characteristics but also full military characteristics. Wang betrayed his motherland and received a more concrete and subtle ironclad proof. Herewith, the various secret agreements and contracts sent by Gao and Tao are specifically disclosed in eight categories.

First, regarding the exclusive occupation of national defense resources, although the outline signed only has three articles, it has exhaustively covered all secondary sources in Central China. The provisions of the third article clearly refuse the participation of third countries. This undertaking not only adopts a policy of non-permission for the present and the future, but also quickly finds ways to cancel those that have already been permitted or have been engaged in development for a long time in the past. The original text of the secret agreement is as follows: Essentials for Handling the Development of Important National Defense Mineral Resources in Central China (Policy): In order to cope with the long-term resistance of the National Government and to start long-term construction, the important national defense mineral resources stored in the Central China region should be quickly planned and developed. (Essentials): (1) Among the important national defense mineral resources, the following items will be investigated first. Therefore, the authorities of the Reorganized Government and the local authorities of the Japanese side should quickly establish a concrete investigation plan and implement it immediately. (Items) Iron, copper, lead, zinc, tin, antimony, manganese, nickel, aluminum, fluorite, coal, kerosene. (2) The existing important national defense resources and the newly discovered important mineral resources from the investigation in the previous article will be currently controlled and developed by the Central China Iron and Mining Joint Stock Company. (3) In order to prevent the dispersion of mining rights, the Reorganized Government shall expedite the revision of relevant laws and take other necessary measures for the national defense mineral resources in the first article. (Remarks): (1) The authorities of the Reorganized Government and the local authorities of the Japanese side shall cooperate with each other in accordance with the spirit of this outline to achieve its realization. (2) Concrete and detailed matters shall be separately stipulated by the parties concerned in China and Japan. November 30, Showa 13, that is, November 30, the 27th year of the Republic of China. This document consists of five copies, which are permanently kept separately by the Army Special Service Department, the Navy Special Service Department, the Shanghai Consulate General, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Industry. Imprint of Liang Hongzhi, President of the Executive Yuan; Imprint of Harada Kumakichi, Minister of the Army Special Service Department; Imprint of Wang Zihui, Minister of Industry; Imprint of Nomura Naokuni, Minister of the Navy Special Service Department; Imprint of Shen Nengyi, Vice Minister of Industry; Imprint of Hidaka Shinsaburo, Consul General. Second, regarding the development and control of iron and steel, a special company will be established to operate it. Not only will it seize existing mines, but also undiscovered mines. The original text is as follows: Outline for the Establishment of Central China Iron and Mining Joint Stock Company: (1) To develop and control iron mines in the Central China area. (2) First, establish a company in accordance with the following methods: (1) Established in accordance with the rules for the establishment of initiators. (2) In accordance with the current method of capital contribution, but after the mine is quickly investigated and the price is determined, it can be used as capital in kind, that is, the capital increase of the company, so that the Chinese shareholders can participate in the majority and become a truly Sino-Japanese joint venture company. (3) The initial capital of 10 million yuan will be paid in one-quarter, of which 275,000 yuan is hoped to be contributed by the Chinese side (61,250 yuan will be temporarily paid by the Japanese side). (4) The inaugural general meeting is scheduled for April 8. (3) The mines that should be controlled and operated by the company initially are as follows: (1) Fulimin Company, Nanshan, Xiaogushan, and other mines. (1) Guanxin Company, Da'aoshan and other iron mines. (3) Yihua Company, Huangmeishan, Hukoushan, and others. (4) Juye Company, Zhongshan and others. (5) Various iron mines in Gaozi. (6) Changcheng Company, Jingniushan and others. (7) Moling Company, Fenghuangshan and others. (8) Various iron mines in the Sanshanzhen area and other iron mines in the occupied area. (4) Business plan: The first year is set to mine 1 million tons, and then increase by 1 million tons each year. The fifth year will mine 5 million tons. (Remarks) The chairman and vice chairman (president and vice president) will not be elected for the time being. The executive director will be the head, and directors in charge of technology will be gradually added. Yuan Naikuan, the president of the Sino-Japanese Industry Association, will serve as a director, and another person will be recommended to serve as a supervisor. When the mine is used as capital in kind, the Chinese side can recommend the vice chairman and other staff. August 9, Showa 13, Republic of China 27th year, August 9, Imprint of the Special Service Department, Imprint of the Construction Section Chief, Imprint of the Minister of Industry, Imprint of the Vice Minister of Industry.

The third article concerns two types of secret agreements regarding railways, which are the most important. One is (Agreement on Central China Railway Co., Ltd.,) and the other is (Outline for the Establishment of Central China Railway Co., Ltd.). The former stipulates the principles, and the latter stipulates the methods.

### Navy Budget Passed by the House of Representatives; Britain Determined to Use All Its Strength to Maintain Maritime Hegemony and Cope with Submarine and Mine Warfare Against Germany; Churchill Claims Absolute Confidence; Torpedoing of HMS Nelson Confirmed

London - The next fiscal year's naval budget proposed by First Lord of the Admiralty Churchill was recently passed by the House of Commons. According to the government, due to the desire to maintain secrecy regarding the budgets of various national defense departments, only symbolic figures were presented, with each department accounting for £100. (Havas dispatch, 27th)

London - When introducing the naval budget to the House of Commons yesterday, First Lord of the Admiralty Churchill spoke amidst cheers, saying, "I represent the Navy in requesting the construction of more ships and the allocation of more funds so that the Navy can carry out its work. The duties of the Navy and the Admiralty, the circumstances they encounter while performing their duties, and the inevitable, albeit regrettable, losses we suffer despite our best efforts are now gradually becoming more widely understood. In this regard, we can only strive even harder to fulfill our responsibilities and satisfy the nation with good results. My only regret is that I cannot accurately reveal the facts and figures regarding the proposed naval strength and budget to the House."

"By the end of 1939, Germany had lost half of its submarines for various reasons. In the last two days, the loss of one German submarine has been confirmed, and the loss of two more is largely confirmed. The Navy is at the forefront of the current war. If there were no other considerations, I would first propose reviewing the Navy's strength and needs. However, the time is not yet right. We constantly anticipate that the enemy will launch even greater attacks on our lifeline of supplies. A few months ago, I estimated Germany's submarine production rate at two per week. I now know this was incorrect. Even if Germany is capable of this in the future, it had not managed to build two submarines per week by the end of 1939. At the end of 1939, Germany had about 45 submarines, 20 of which required training, leaving approximately 25 seaworthy. These 25 would have to be divided into two or three groups for rotation, so the number deployed at any one time would not be very large, perhaps no more than ten. The number of German submarines lost is increasing daily, but we do not release news of submarine sinkings until we are certain they have sunk. Although the number of submarines appearing at sea is small, we have not been without significant losses."

"From this, the House can see how thorough and extensive our preparations must be. We are now making these preparations to cope with any major attacks that may occur in the future. We anticipate that new German submarines will gradually become active after the summer, and we will respond with new types of large aircraft best suited to destroying submarines. This summer, we will build these new aircraft at maximum speed. At the same time, the production rate of new merchant ships is now being increased to compensate for inevitable losses. German submarines are now forced to avoid using cannons or torpedoes, and instead lay magnetic or non-magnetic mines in our ports. Although magnetic mines are mechanically ingenious, they are not particularly novel. I can now say that we have discovered a method to defeat these magnetic mines and similar devices. We are not inferior to the Germans in science." (Cheers)

"The procedure for dealing with magnetic mines has two stages: first, to determine how to defeat them; second, having learned how to defeat them, to actively use this knowledge. We have now reached the second stage. Although we must anticipate that the enemy will use this method in the future to inflict even greater blows upon us, we believe we will be able to cope with them. To deal with mine attacks, we must utilize fishing boats and fishermen. Although we still need 250,000 sailors for deployment this year, we recruited tens of thousands of volunteers to undertake mine-sweeping operations at the end of last November. The volunteers' service was initially set for three months, but this period must be extended, as is now evident. Three-quarters of the volunteers in many seaports who were originally serving for three months have now expressed their willingness to continue serving for the duration of the war. The Admiralty is now preparing to fulfill their wishes." (Cheers)

"Some German aviators have attacked unarmed vessels and strafed crew members taking refuge in lifeboats. Such cruel behavior is indefensible. We have had to find ways to equip our fishing boats and small vessels with self-defense tools. We now know that some German aircraft, upon seeing that fishing boats are armed with cannons, quickly retreat. We have recently issued thousands of cannons of various sizes for use on passenger ships and fishing boats. Germany cites this as justification for its own violations of conventions. Germany will certainly use its methods more aggressively. The cruelty of Hitler and his party surpasses that of Germany in the last war. The violent and barbaric actions taken by Germany are now gradually being accepted as if they were everyday occurrences. This is truly one of the strangest events I have ever experienced. When I make statements informing neutral countries of their responsibilities, they vehemently object, but they do not protest as loudly when ships are sunk. Why is that?" (Laughter) "In fact, the number of their sailors who have drowned or been killed on the high seas exceeds a thousand."

"The doctrine currently embraced by neutral countries is almost endorsed by Germany. According to this doctrine, Germany can gain a certain advantage by using all kinds of atrocities that violate all rules, and then, when it deems appropriate, demand that other countries apply the international rules it has already torn up with extreme strictness to gain another advantage. It is no wonder that the British government rejects this, and so do I." (Laughter) "I can say without hesitation that in the interpretation of international rules involving neutral countries, our primary guidance must be humanity, not legal quibbles. As the 'Altmark' incident shows, this seems to be the opinion not only of Britain but of the civilized world."

"We currently have an unquestionable advantage in terms of battleships. Otherwise, German heavy cruisers would appear in the Atlantic and roam unchecked, halting, or at least hindering, our entire trade, without which we cannot live. They could also establish temporary bases throughout the globe and hold positions that Britain could not attack. If that were the case, would we not quickly decline? Fortunately, our battleships are far stronger than the enemy's. If enemy ships dare to appear, we are ready at any time to engage them with greater force and reduce them like the 'Graf Spee.' If we did not have a superior battle fleet, how could we seize naval power, and how could we maintain our livelihood? In the last war, Britain had to constantly prepare three to four dozen battleships and their accompanying fleets in order to fight a decisive battle against Germany at any time. But today, this kind of arrangement has been greatly reduced because the enemy now has only two real capital ships and cannot hope to form a line of battle. Britain can form at least three lines of battle, none of which Germany can withstand. Therefore, we can now deploy warships more widely than before, while still maintaining a sufficient number of warships at sea, ready to strike a heavy blow when enemy ships appear. Our entire naval power depends on this."

"The new ships currently being built by Britain are able to withstand aerial bombardment and are more resistant to underwater explosions, far surpassing today's warships. There is no need to worry excessively about British naval power. HMS Barham, an old ship, was not greatly damaged despite being hit by a torpedo and will soon be repaired and returned to service. HMS Nelson, built 15 years ago, was damaged by a magnetic mine and will also rejoin the fleet soon. This is confidential information, of course, known to tens of thousands of people, but kept secret until it is no longer of great importance, and then allowed to leak to Germany." (Laughter) "Apart from HMS Royal Oak and HMS Courageous, no other capital ships have been damaged or sunk since the start of the war. Since the invention of the steam engine, never in the history of warfare have warships of all sizes patrolled the sea as continuously and frequently as this time. In the first 119 days after the start of the war, warships, even with aging machinery, were on the waves for 90 days. This demonstrates the capabilities of the British naval engineering team. In the future, as more warships are added, the nights will be shorter, and aircraft reconnaissance will be more extensive, so the entire contraband control system will certainly become more effective. From the naval observation point, it is not difficult to make the blockade more stringent, but the importance of political decisions based on foreign relations cannot be ignored, so a balance between these two must be maintained. In the past six months, we have lost 63,000 tons of warships, about half of the losses in the first six months of the last war. After offsetting gains and losses in merchant ships, we have lost less than 200,000 tons out of 21 million tons. In April 1917 alone, ship losses totaled 450,000 tons, which is incomparable to this. We have intercepted more goods destined for enemy countries, by tonnage, than we have lost." (Reuters dispatch, 28th)

London - Yesterday, First Lord of the Admiralty Churchill announced for the first time that the battleship HMS Nelson, which struck a mine in December of last year, had its hull pierced, and it was believed that some crew members were injured. HMS Nelson, with a displacement of 35,000 tons and built 15 years ago, is still one of the most powerful warships in the British fleet, armed with nine 16-inch main guns and twelve 6-inch guns. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)

Amsterdam - Yesterday, Churchill admitted in a report to the House of Commons that the British warship HMS Nelson had been severely damaged and also admitted that the warship HMS Barham had been hit by a torpedo. HMS Nelson is one of the two most powerful battleships in the world, launched in 1925, with a displacement of 33,950 tons, a speed of 23.5 knots, a crew of 1,320, and armed with nine 16-inch guns, twelve 6-inch guns, six 4.7-inch anti-aircraft guns, twenty-two other anti-aircraft guns, and eight machine guns, as well as two torpedo tubes.

### A Shrew Can Transform into a Meek Lamb!

"The daughter of the congee family marries into the rice family." Since ancient times, in marriages, the man's family should always be slightly better than the woman's. This is the proper way, and there is a profound reason for it. It would take too long to explain in detail. The same is true for the sexual life of a married couple. If the man's sexual ability is not slightly superior, it will inevitably affect the establishment of the husband's authority and weaken his control. This will diminish the wife's admiration and respect. As a result, jealousy arises, and the wife becomes domineering. The once proud man has no choice but to yield and submit because of his inner shame. However, over time, there is no joy in conjugal harmony, and the husband's authority is completely lost. What is the point of life? To seek happiness, why not immediately purchase the "Polemin fanlels" mystical elixir for enhancing sexual vitality from the Western Music Department of Wing On Company? Currently, it is on special offer, with each bottle of French currency costing one yuan, and you get one free when you buy one. This medicine can strengthen your body, fortify your kidneys, and consolidate your essence. Soon after taking it, it can change your style, transforming weakness into strength and making you physically robust. At that time, the other party will be surprised and delighted. From then on, her psychology will shift, and her shrewish roars will cease. In the bedroom, she will cling to her husband like a little bird, docile and submissive, just like a pair of meek lambs.

### British Aircraft Repeatedly Reconnoiter German Naval Bases and Scatter Leaflets over Berlin; Germany Claims One British Aircraft Shot Down; Germany Also Loses Two Aircraft in Britain

London - The Air Ministry has announced that multiple British aircraft have repeatedly conducted reconnaissance flights over the German naval base at Heligoland Bight in the past two days, with considerable success. They also flew to various locations along the German North Sea and Baltic Sea coasts, as well as Berlin and Hamburg, before returning. One aircraft has not returned to base and is presumed lost. In addition, we shot down two enemy aircraft off our coast today. Since the start of the war, a total of 43 German aircraft have been shot down over or off the coast of our country, and another nine aircraft, after being attacked by our aircraft, are believed not to have returned to base. Air Force sources also said that British aircraft, while conducting reconnaissance over Berlin this morning, scattered leaflets in the city and its suburbs. They encountered one German aircraft but did not engage. (Havas dispatch, 27th)

### One German Warship Sunk by a French Warship

Paris - The Navy Ministry has announced that the French destroyer "Simon" has sunk a German submarine off Cape Finisterre in northwestern Spain. When the "Simon" spotted the submarine's periscope, it immediately steamed towards it and dropped several depth charges. The submarine submerged for a while and then resurfaced. The "Simon" rammed it head-on and dropped another batch of depth charges. Soon after, a slick of oil, stretching for eight nautical miles, appeared on the surface, indicating that the submarine had undoubtedly sunk. The "Simon" sustained minor damage in the collision. (Note: The ship has a displacement of 1,319 tons and belongs to the same class as the "Sirocco," which has sunk three German submarines.) (Havas dispatch, 7th)

### US House of Representatives Reduces Naval Budget

Washington - When President Roosevelt submitted his budget message to Congress in early January, he requested an appropriation of $15 million to build a third lock at the Panama Canal.

### Soviet Union Expands Far East Navy, Causing Concern in Japan; Outstanding Issues Between the Two Countries Become More Difficult to Resolve Satisfactorily

Tokyo - The Japanese "Yomiuri Shimbun" argued that reports of the Soviet Union's increasing naval strength in the Far East are of "extreme concern" to Japan. The newspaper quoted the Deputy Chairman of the Soviet People's Commissariat for the Navy as saying that the Soviet Union has 100 submarines, 12 torpedo boats, and other auxiliary ships based in Vladivostok in the Far East. "From the Soviet Union's point of view, the Soviet Union has the right to implement the above policies, but it is doubtful whether these policies are in line with current Japan-Soviet relations." The newspaper indicated that the commercial negotiations held in Moscow and the agreement by the opposing parties to organize a demarcation committee could indicate an improvement in Japan-Soviet relations, but warned that Japan-Soviet naval competition would hinder the satisfactory resolution of outstanding issues between the two countries. "If the Soviet Union's goal is to increase the strength of its Pacific Fleet, then Japan must, in addition to adjusting diplomatic relations, seriously consider countermeasures."

According to the Finnish side, the Soviet offensive began with a large number of aircraft bombing, followed by tank assaults and infantry advances. The recent increase in Soviet air force activity is due to Finnish acquisition of foreign aircraft assistance, which prompted the Soviet Union to take preemptive action. Several new divisions of Soviet troops have also been added in the Petsamo area of northern Finland, putting great pressure on Finnish troops, aiming to drive them inland to prevent them from making contact with the British Navy. (Associated Press dispatch, 28th)

Stockholm, Sweden - The Soviet army, having occupied the Koivisto fortress, opened the way for advance. When Soviet troops reach the tip of the Koivisto Peninsula, they will be only five miles from the main Finnish coast near the civilian-evacuated Sakijärvi.

Senator La Follette said that the United States should find ways to deal with agreements made by belligerent and neutral countries that are detrimental to US trade, such as the Anglo-Turkish tobacco agreement. Senator Barkley said that if the United States forced Britain and France to buy tobacco from the United States, rather than providing them with US aircraft and other war materials, what would the result be? Agriculture Secretary Wallace replied that this would undoubtedly cause deep resentment and distrust towards us. If the United States attempts to force belligerent countries to buy agricultural products from the United States as if purchasing their needed munitions, then belligerent countries may retaliate economically after the war. Congress should continue its reciprocal trade program to create a valuable foundation for the future reconstruction of world trade. Senator La Follette then said that he heard the Anglo-Turkish agreement lasted for 25 years. Wallace replied that British Ambassador Lothian had told him that news reports about the agreement were inaccurate and that the British Ambassador hoped to discuss the matter with us another day.

New York - Republican Senator Vandenberg recently sent a letter to Mr. Lippmann, a reporter for the New York Herald Tribune, opposing the imposition of an embargo on Japan. He said, "If the United States imposes an embargo on Japan, it will be taking a step towards war. When I introduced a bill in the Senate on July 18 of last year, requesting the government to declare the abolition of the US-Japan commercial treaty, it was not intended as a prelude to a unilateral embargo. Although I oppose the embargo now, if Japan still does not respect our legitimate rights in the Far East, then this measure is not without the possibility of implementation. I hope the Japanese authorities will pay attention to this." (Havas dispatch, 27th)

### Japanese Airplane "Dragon Wind" Arrives in Bangkok

Tokyo: The Japanese authorities plan to inaugurate an airmail route between Tokyo and Bangkok. The Japanese airplane "Dragon Wind" departed on the 26th of this month for a trial flight and arrived in Bangkok yesterday. It is noted that the French authorities announced in December of last year that, due to the European war, they had to revoke the right for Japanese airplanes to fly over French Indochina. If Japanese airplanes do not take the route through Vietnam, the total distance will increase by 540 miles, and the route will be less safe. Therefore, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and airlines are eager to reach a compromise with the French authorities to establish a landing station in Hanoi, Vietnam, which would not only shorten the journey but also increase safety. It is rumored that France's refusal to allow Japanese airplanes to fly over French Indochina is a retaliatory act for the Japanese bombing of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway. According to news from Paris, French officials deny this claim but also acknowledge that the Japanese bombing of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway only makes all issues more difficult to resolve. In terms of climate, the most suitable time to fly from Tokyo to Bangkok is from January to May. However, between May and September, strong southwest winds are common, and in November, strong northeast winds prevail, both of which are unfavorable. In addition, the air route between the capitals of Japan and Thailand can be divided into three sections: (1) From Tokyo to Taiwan, a distance of 1,300 miles; (2) From Taiwan to Guangzhou, a distance of 520 miles; (3) From Guangzhou to Bangkok, a distance of 1,700 miles, totaling 3,520 miles. The journey can be completed in three days. (Havas, 27th)

### England and Chile Sign a Commercial Agreement

New York: According to Dow Jones News Agency, the Chilean Consulate General in New York announced today that the Chilean Exchange Control Commission and representatives of the British government have signed an agreement stipulating that Britain will purchase wool worth £800,000 from Chile, and Chile will use this foreign exchange to purchase British goods. (Reuters, 27th)

### US Loan to China Expected to Pass Congress; Opinions of Members of Congress Still Highly Divided on the Capital Increase Bill for the Export-Import Bank

Washington: According to news from here today, officials from the Export-Import Bank stated that the $20 million loan to China and the loan to Finland will be implemented as soon as the Congressional deliberations are completed and President Roosevelt signs the bills. They stated that China has a very good credit rating, so Congress may approve the loan to China. It is said that China aims to obtain a loan of $75 million, but this amount is beyond the capacity of the Export-Import Bank. (United Press, 28th)

Washington: The Senate has already voted to pass the bill to increase the capital of the Federal Export-Import Bank by $100 million. The House of Representatives was originally scheduled to discuss the matter quickly and put it to a vote today. However, after five hours of debate, the opinions of the members of Congress are still highly divided, and it has been decided to postpone the vote until tomorrow. Some members believe that since the bill does not specifically mention providing credit to Finland, it is clearly not intended to benefit that country. Other members argue that the bill would only benefit Finland, and if it is enacted, it would set a precedent that would eventually draw the United States into the whirlpool of war, which is not advisable. In general, those members of Congress who spoke expressed sympathy for the heroic resistance of the Finnish people but have not been able to reach a conclusion, that is, whether the United States should provide loans to Finland without restricting their use. This policy has not yet been established in the House of Representatives. (Havas, 27th)

New York Air Dispatch: A reporter from the New York People's Forum observing the issue of Finland's application for a loan from the United States believes that it has failed. The reason is that President Roosevelt is unwilling to promote an understanding between the Soviet Union and Japan. "The White House and the State Department have always had many concerns about Finland's application for a loan to purchase military supplies and have ultimately refused the request. If we want to find an explanation, we must carefully examine the true nature of the relationship between the United States and Japan. According to responsible officials, the tension between the United States and Japan is more severe than the American public imagines." (Havas)

### American Newspaper Comments on US-Japan Trade

New York: The New York Daily Mirror recently published an editorial on the commercial relationship between the United States and Japan, stating that the commercial relationship between the United States and Japan, which has now expired, was originally maintained by silk and cotton. However, the United States has a surplus of cotton, and warehouses everywhere are full. The raw silk it needs accounts for 70 percent of Japan's total production. "Japan can obtain the cotton it needs from India and Brazil, and the kerosene it needs from Mexico and Venezuela. However, the United States relies mainly on Japan for the raw silk it needs, and there is no other country that can replace it. The American silk industry, centered in New York City, employs 500,000 workers. The consumption of raw silk was 21,128 bales in December of last year, and it increased to 40,816 bales in January of this year. In January of this year, a total of 33,121 bales of raw silk were imported, of which Japan accounted for 27,020 bales, China accounted for 5,665 bales, and European countries accounted for 436 bales."

### Panama Canal Defense Equipment Needs to Be Doubled

New York: Yesterday, President Roosevelt inspected the defenses of the Panama Canal.

### Welles Consults Zhou to Gauge European Political Tides; Brief Stopover in Switzerland En Route to Germany; Generally Expected to Achieve Concrete Results

Rome: US Undersecretary of State Welles, representing President Roosevelt to tour Europe and review the overall situation, departed from Rome after midnight to Berlin. Mussolini sent a letter to Welles, warmly inviting him to visit Rome again on his return trip to the United States. Welles told reporters that his mission was to "gauge the depth and currents of the European political sea." He expressed his pleasure at the warm welcome in Rome but denied that he was carrying any proposals from President Roosevelt to any European government. Welles also remained silent on the results of his talks in Rome. Diplomatic and political figures believe that "unless Welles does miraculous work in London, Berlin, and Paris," he will not have any actions to end the war when he returns to Washington. However, it is believed that the general hope that Welles' trip will produce valuable concrete results is well-founded, so public interest in Welles' mission remains high. It is said that the letter President Roosevelt carried to Mussolini was a personal letter introducing Welles. (Reuters, 28th)

Rome: US Undersecretary of State Welles left here last night for Zurich, Switzerland, to go to Berlin to study the war situation and hopes for peace. He was accompanied by his private secretary. Officials from the American Embassy here escorted Welles to the train station. Before departing, Welles told reporters that he could not announce the content of his talks with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini. He said, "Regarding my talks with Mussolini, I always refer to President Roosevelt's statements that my responsibility is to report to the President on the European situation during my travels in Italy, Germany, and England. My report will be strictly confidential. I do not represent the United States in making any suggestions or promises. I am naturally in contact with the State Department. I am very grateful for the kindness of the Italian government, and I feel that the talks were very beneficial." (United Press, 28th)

Rome: US Secretary of State Welles left for Zurich, Switzerland, at 12:15 AM this morning, so that he may go to Berlin tomorrow. The secretary of the US Embassy in Germany, Rahlmanson, came here from Berlin yesterday to greet him and also went to Germany with him today. When departing, Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Chief of Protocol Celesia and many American dignitaries were at the station to see him off. (Havas, 28th)

### President Roosevelt Sends Letter to the Pope, Willing to Jointly Strive for Peace from a Religious and Humanitarian Perspective

Vatican: President Roosevelt sent a letter to the Pope, mentioning Myron Taylor's appointment as his personal representative to the Vatican, stating that he hoped that Taylor would be a link for both parties to exchange views in order to seek harmony among the people of the world. He has instructed Taylor to pay his respects to the Holy See, and he hopes that the common views on religion and humanity can be expressed in a common path to establish a more lasting peace based on freedom and safety of life and the integrity of all countries under God's protection. (Reuters, 28th)

### Rumor of Hitler's Proposed Peace Plan; Germany Rejects British Newspaper's False Claims

Berlin: Hamburg's "Foreign Review" has a good relationship with Goering. Because the "Daily Telegraph," the mouthpiece of the British military, published slanderous remarks yesterday, the newspaper's editorial today made the following defense: It is claimed that the "Daily Telegraph" stated that Hitler would give Welles a draft peace plan when Welles was hired in Berlin, and it was stated that the plan included three main points: (1) Germany is prepared to establish a new Polish state; (2) Grant administrative autonomy to the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia; (3) Germany will participate in a disarmament conference, etc. All of which are inaccurate. We understand the meaning of this kind of slander. In short, the fact that Britain and France have been at war with Germany for six months, and military actions and blockade measures on the sea, land, and air have failed to win, is a fact known to the people of Britain and France. As public sentiment declines, the opportunity of Welles' visit is used to spread rumors to boost the morale of Britain and France. (Haitong News Agency, 28th)

### Shanghai West District Police Affairs Negotiation Raised for Discussion in British House of Commons; Butler Reports on Progress

London: Undersecretary Butler stated in the House of Commons today during a discussion of the Shanghai extraterritorial roads issue that, according to recent reports, the criminal situation in the Shanghai West District extraterritorial road area is still very bad. However, the Japanese authorities have expressed their intention to eliminate some gambling dens and sources of crime. Such gambling dens, etc., are the main causes of disorder in the area. Since the signing of the temporary agreement on police affairs on extraterritorial roads, the Japanese Consul General has issued a public statement stating that the Japanese authorities are prepared to continue negotiations on police affairs in Hongkou and other areas north of the Suzhou Creek. In fact, both sides have already started these talks, and it is hoped that other outstanding issues regarding the jurisdiction of the Municipal Council in the aforementioned areas can be resolved. Conservative Party member Milner asked Butler whether he would express his gratitude to the Japanese side for the practical actions they planned and promote the implementation of this work to the extent possible. Butler replied that he would very much like to see this action. (Reuters, 28th)

### Britain Considers Establishing a Contraband Control Zone in Vladivostok to Prevent German-Soviet Freight

London: British Minister of Economic Warfare Cross made a shocking announcement to the House of Commons yesterday, stating that Britain is considering establishing a contraband control zone in the Vladivostok area to prevent the Soviet Union from importing goods to Germany. This document can be interpreted as an increase in British-Soviet friction. This plan will increase the work of the British Navy in the North Pacific. The British Navy will manage the shipment of tin, rubber and other raw materials to the Soviet Union. (United Press, 28th)

### Japanese Warships Again Detain British Ships Outside Wenzhou; Two Ships Released, Two Still Detained; Japanese Warships Fire on British Ship Outside Yantai

Since Japanese warships hindered foreign ships from sailing to Wenzhou, shipping on the Shanghai-Wenzhou route has been greatly affected. However, in order to facilitate the transportation of goods, shipping companies continue to operate. According to information from the New Voice News Agency, the British ships "Joseph," "Tongshun," and "Daxin" recently sailed from Wenzhou to Shanghai and were again intercepted by a Japanese destroyer outside Wenzhou.

Three Motorboats Prevented Progress

At that time, the warship was anchored at the mouth of the Yanpan River. When it saw three ships sailing from the Oujiang River, it launched three motorboats and approached the ships to prevent them from proceeding. At the same time, the Japanese warship used signal flags to order them to anchor. The shipowners stopped sailing to avoid accidents. The Japanese army then boarded the ships and demanded inspection. The shipowners refused without success.

Repeated Negotiations Result in Release of Two Ships

Unexpectedly, the Japanese army lingered under the guise of inspection, effectively placing the foreign ships under house arrest for a day and night. After repeated negotiations by the shipowners, the "Joseph" and "Tongshun" were released the night before and arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon. The "Daxin" has not yet been released.

No News of the Yongtai Ship

It is also learned that there is still one ship, the "Yongtai," which telegraphed the night before that it would be able to come to Shanghai soon, but it has not arrived yet yesterday. It is feared that it was intercepted by a Japanese warship en route. The British ship "Mary Moller" sailed from Shanghai to Wenzhou last Friday, taking six days to arrive. It was not until yesterday that it telegraphed to Shanghai, saying that it had arrived in Wenzhou on the evening of the 27th. The other ships, "Xinan Na," "Yonghua," "Xinan Tong," and "Xinan Li," have not continued to sail since returning to Shanghai last week due to the difficulty of sailing on the route. Whether they will sail to Wenzhou again will depend on the situation.

Japanese Warship Fires on Hunan

The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury" reported that yesterday (the 27th) at 5:00 PM, news broadcast from London said that the Swire Company's "Hunan" was intercepted by a Japanese warship outside Yantai. However, the interception procedure was unusual: the Japanese warship fired a solid small cannonball, which mistakenly hit the British ship. The Japanese government quickly apologized for the error and promised compensation. It is now believed that the matter has been resolved.

### Fessenden Not Resigning; Yesterday's News Reports Inaccurate

Yesterday, some newspapers reported that Fessenden, the Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, had expressed his intention to resign, which aroused great concern from all parties, both Chinese and foreign. Because Mr. Fessenden has been well-received since taking office, all sectors of society deeply hope that he will shoulder the arduous task. Yesterday, foreign reporters specially interviewed Mr. Fessenden on this matter. According to Mr. Fessenden's reply, "I have not submitted my resignation, nor do I intend to resign," confirming that the rumor was inaccurate.

### General Electric Strike Quickly Settled

Resumed Normal Work Yesterday

The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury" reported that workers at the General Electric Company on Route Robert Sivel (sic) went on strike last night, locking the gates and preventing anyone from entering or leaving. Marine Corps personnel arrived after receiving the news and issued a notice. Five minutes later, they threw smoke bombs outside the gate to disperse the strikers inside the gate. The time was 8:30 PM. A person climbed over the gate to unlock it. In less than an hour, the police had resolved the strike. The factory resumed normal work today (the 28th).

### Municipal Council Public Works Department Strike Not Yet Resolved

2,500 Strikers; Disturbances Occurred in Several Places Yesterday

Several hundred workers in the Public Works Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council joined the 2,000 workers who had already gone on strike last week and went on strike together. The police department received reports of disturbances in several places. Some workers pushing manure carts, who were not on strike, were attacked by strikers yesterday, causing great annoyance and inconvenience to the public.

One of the disturbances occurred on Gansu Road near Suzhou Creek, when a manure cart was pushed into the river by rioters. Another incident occurred on Muirhead Road, where the manure in the cart was

Dumped on the ground by the strikers. The police department did not make any arrests. The total number of strikers has now reached 2,500, most of whom are road repair workers. The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury" also reported that thousands of workers in the Public Works Department of the Municipal Council

Went on strike demanding rice subsidies. Although the Municipal Council agreed to increase their wages appropriately, the strikers demanded higher wages and rejected the new subsidies offered by the Municipal Council, resulting in disturbances such as dumping manure on the ground this morning (the 28th). However, there were no major riots, because the strikers dispersed as soon as they saw the police arriving. The incidents caused by the strikers today include (1) dismantling two wheels of a manure cart on Muirhead Road, causing manure to flow all over the road; (2) throwing a manure cart into the river at the manure station on Gansu Road in the West Hongkou District; (3) and throwing several manure carts into the river at the manure station in the Zhabei District. Other incidents of breaking cleaning brushes also occurred in several other places.

### Postal Workers' Request; General Post Office Replied

Approved Rice Subsidy as per Kunming Precedent

Three months after the outbreak of the Shanghai War, the Shanghai Post Office implemented salary cuts, initially paying 60% of salaries. Although it has since improved, salaries are still paid at 80% to this day. The employees of the post office are deeply aware of the difficulty of maintaining their livelihoods under the pressure of the skyrocketing prices in the city and have repeatedly requested the authorities to restore full salaries, which has not been approved. All employees then submitted two requests to the authorities in December of last year: (1) When the price of rice exceeds 30 yuan, the excess amount will be subsidized by the authorities; (2) Relief subsidies will be issued according to 10% of salaries. The above two requests were submitted to the authorities by the association, and Director Cha urgently forwarded them to the General Post Office. It is now learned that a reply has been received from the General Post Office, approving the issuance of rice subsidies according to the Kunming precedent. Employees of post offices in the Shanghai area will also receive appropriate subsidies. However, the request to issue a 10% relief subsidy has not been approved. It is heard that Director Cha has promised to continue to strive for it on behalf of the employees, so that the employees' livelihoods can be maintained.

### French Ambassador Sympathetic to China; Japanese Side Pays Great Attention; Even Mentions Franco-Japanese Friendship; Miura Once Sent a Letter Inquiring of Mr. Baudic

French Ambassador to China Cossé gave a speech at the China-France-Belgium-Switzerland Cultural Association in Chongqing on the 25th. According to reports, his speech stated that "China and France are currently in the same position, that is, both are fighting against aggressors, so they must help each other." Yesterday, a spokesperson for the Japanese Embassy told foreign reporters that if this news is true, it will affect Franco-Japanese friendship. It is learned that Japanese Consul General Miura sent a letter to French Consul General in Shanghai Baudic for this purpose, but no reply has been received so far. It is also heard that the Japanese side is paying close attention to the French Ambassador's speech at the National Diplomacy Association on January 4, in which he praised China's war of resistance.

### Taxes in the French Concession Will Not Increase Temporarily; Increased by 20% Since January This Year; Expected Not to Continue to Increase in July

The Shanghai Times reported that the Public Concession is about to increase taxes. Yesterday (the 27th), a reporter asked an official of the French Municipal Council whether the French Concession plans to increase taxes in July. The reply was that, as far as is known at present, the French Concession is not expected to continue to increase taxes in July. It is noted that taxes in the French Concession were 13% in 1937 and increased to 15% from January 1, 1939. However, on December 29 of the same year, the Municipal Council, in view of the outbreak of war in Europe, decided to add an additional 20% surcharge from January 1 of this year, totaling 17%. This additional 20% defense surcharge is remitted to France.

### Japanese Fruits Dumped in Shanghai

Exports to Europe and the United States Sharply Reduced; Efforts to Import to Shanghai Increased

The "Central Market" organized by the Japanese side originally intended to control vegetables, local products, fruits, and other goods. However, due to opposition from various industries concerned, the opening date has now been postponed. However, before the "Market" starts, the Japanese side is still extremely meticulous about fruits, suppressing imports while trying to sell Japanese products as much as possible. It has been learned that because of the difficulty of exporting Japanese fruits to Europe and the sharp decline in trade with the South Seas and the Americas, they have had no choice but to increase their efforts to import and dump them in Shanghai, China, hoping to make up for the decline in fruit trade with various countries around the world. The Japanese fruit industry has jointly formed the "Fresh Fruit Export Association," specializing in managing fruit trade with China. Recently, Japanese transport ships sailing from Japan to Shanghai have been fully loaded with large quantities of Japanese "apples" and "pears" arriving in port. Their cost is lower than that of Chinese fruits, so their selling price is slightly lower, attracting various fruit merchants to sell them on their behalf. However, buyers can distinguish them by the color of the fruit skin.

### Chinese and Foreign Leaders Give Farewell Dinner for American Consul General

Gauss About to Go to Australia

The Continental Times reported that American Consul General in Shanghai Gauss has recently been appointed as the American Minister to Australia.

Noodle Businesses Resumed Operations Yesterday

There were originally over 300 noodle businesses in the city, mostly run by people from Hubei, operating on a small scale. Due to the unavailability of flour, the businesses collectively decided to suspend operations from the 26th. Now, the Noodle Business Association, urgently in need of assistance, had Chairman Luo Haitao submit a special petition to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, outlining their difficulties and requesting solutions. The Chamber then sent a letter of introduction to the Shanghai Municipal Council, requesting assistance similar to that provided to the noodle-cutting industry. Deputy Secretary Ho of the Shanghai Municipal Council has agreed to the request, and 184 registered businesses will each receive two bags of flour directly from the flour mills daily. The distribution began yesterday, the 28th, with collection at the Yuang Feng Flour Mill on Nanyang Bridge. These businesses resumed operations yesterday. As for businesses operating on roads beyond the settlement limits that have not yet registered, they have begun the process of registering for the second round of flour distribution.

### Restoration and Construction Public Bonds - Principal and Interest Repayment

The eighth repayment of principal and interest on the 25th Year of the Republic Restoration Public Bonds. After the National Debt Fund Committee and the four banks (Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Farmers Bank of China) agreed on a method for discounting and paying, the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank of China has been ordered to begin payments today jointly with the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications. Those holding winning bonds and matured coupons should first fill out a discount application. In Shanghai, payments will be made in six installments, each lasting one month, with applicable drafts issued. As for the fourth principal and interest repayment of the first issuance of the third-period Railway Construction Public Bonds, and the third principal and interest repayment of the second issuance, the Ministry of Finance has allocated subsidies, and the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank of China will make full payments starting today. However, these bonds are mostly in the hands of banks, with few circulating in the market. Furthermore, the ninth principal repayment of the Category B bonds of the 25th Year of the Republic Unified Public Bonds, and the twenty-second principal repayment of the 17th Year of the Republic Long-Term Financial Public Bonds, are scheduled for a lottery at 10 AM on March 9th.

The British Election Committee issued a notice to all British taxpayers yesterday, urging them to work hard in the upcoming Shanghai Municipal Council elections. Americans are also taking similar actions, making every effort to ensure that American expatriates in Shanghai can register and participate in the elections, emphasizing the importance of American participation in the elections as much as the British.

### British Shanghai Public Omnibus Company - Coppersmiths Request Pay Raise - Submitted Eight Demands to Company Authorities - No Response as of 10 PM Last Night

In the Shanghai Public Omnibus Company's Shanghai West Kangding Road depot, besides the drivers and conductors on the buses, there are also 450 coppersmiths employed. Their duties include not only repairing bus parts but also cleaning the bus bodies, glass windows, and adding oil daily, so the work is quite heavy. Since the sharp increase in prices last year, the company authorities had granted some subsidies at the request of the employees, but the amount was limited, and prices continued to rise sharply, doubling in the past three months. As a result, the additional subsidies received by the general employees were still insufficient to make ends meet. Therefore, all the coppersmiths in the factory jointly submitted a petition on the 14th of this month, requesting the company authorities to provide further assistance and demanding a public response by 10 AM yesterday, the 28th. However, the company authorities believed that no further increases could be made, so they did not accept it. The employees, on the other hand, believed that the company's business was booming and that granting their requests would not only not harm the company's interests but would also be reasonable. Therefore, after 10 AM yesterday morning, they elected representatives to request the company authorities to provide a formal written response by 4 PM yesterday, to meet public expectations. However, no news came at that time. Therefore, all the coppersmiths first went on strike and demanded that the company consider their difficult situation, accept their requests, and respond by 10 PM that night. Unfortunately, no results were achieved by then. Therefore, the coppersmiths went on strike and formally proposed eight demands, including a 40% wage increase, increased rice subsidies, and no dismissal of employees, requesting the company authorities to adopt them. According to reporters, the company authorities are said to respond to the coppersmiths' requests at 10 AM today, the 29th.

The eight demands are reportedly: (1) Increase wages by 40%; (2) Increase rice subsidies to 15 yuan per month; (3) Restore the same treatment for new and old employees in terms of annual bonuses (i.e., an additional 24 days' wages per person per year); (4) Require the company authorities to formally recognize the Coppersmiths' Union; (5) In the event of an employee's work-related death, the company will allocate a compensation fee of 1,000 yuan; (6) Restore rest on Sundays and holidays, otherwise, double wages should be paid; (7) Company employees ride company vehicles for free, and no fees should be charged; (8) No dismissal of employees without cause.

### Extension of Coal Briquette Voucher Delivery - Mass Sale to Start Tomorrow - Fair Price Committee Established - Investigation for Delayed Voucher Delivery

The entire fuel problem in Shanghai is being monopolized and manipulated, resulting in a shortage of spot goods and soaring market prices, which poses a serious threat to ordinary people. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and Mr. Yu Qiaqing, a prominent figure in the business community, have repeatedly sent letters to various fuel industry associations, strongly urging them to find ways to suppress market prices, crack down on illegal transactions in the market, and separately wrote to the authorities of the two concessions, requesting them to plan to dredge the source. Now, the fair-price sale of coal briquettes will begin tomorrow for a period of 20 days, with a limit of 2 jiao (1 jiao equals 1/10 yuan), or 4 catties (1 catty equals 1.1 pounds), per person. A fair-price coal briquette committee was established yesterday. The cooked-water industry has received more than 300 tons of fair-price coal, and the selling price of cooked water is being planned. The detailed information is recorded as follows:

Joint Meeting: The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, in view of the soaring coal prices that affect the livelihood of ordinary people, although the market prices of coal blocks, coal briquettes, firewood, and charcoal have gradually trended downstream, the fundamental solution remains to be resolved. In order to address the root cause, a joint meeting of representatives from the three associations of coal, coal briquette, and firewood and charcoal industries was convened yesterday at the Hong Kong Road Bank Club, with Yu Qiaqing elected as chairman. The chairman first reported the purpose of the meeting, the soaring coal prices, the livelihood of ordinary people, and the relationship to security within the boundaries. The representatives of the two parties stated the key issues of soaring coal prices and contributed to suppressing the methods. The discussion then began, and the meeting adjourned until about 4 pm.

The results of the fuel industry joint meeting yesterday are as follows: (1) Extension of voucher delivery for 15 days, from March 1 to March 15, passed by resolution; (2) Organization of the Fair Price Coal Briquette Committee, passed unanimously by resolution, and the following members were appointed: (A) Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce representatives: Yu Qiaqing, Lin Kanghou, Xu Jilong, Yan Esheng; (B) Coal Industry Association representatives: Wei Zida, Bao Zhexing, Lu Qisheng; (C) Coal Briquette Industry Association representatives: Chen Cuifang, Qian Yaonan, You Chunxin, He Ziguo, Han Pihao; (D) Firewood and Charcoal Industry Association representatives: Ni Baizhai, Wang Zhusheng, Zhou Changchun, totaling 15 people; (3) No new vouchers will be issued, and it has been resolved by the Coal Industry Association and unanimously approved. The Fair Price Coal Briquette Committee is scheduled to convene its first committee meeting at the Bank Club at 4 PM this afternoon to determine the location of the fair price and all procedures.

Investigation of Vouchers: The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce received letters yesterday from 16 coal companies, including Xie Taixing, Yongda, Kunyuanxing, Qinda, Zhang Kunhe, Ruitai, and Shengda, stating that the failure of voucher holders to deliver the stored goods was caused by the factories, so the holders should not only not bear the storage rent, but the factories should also bear the compensation for the losses of the voucher holders, and specially requested to investigate the facts and forward them to the Coal Briquette Association to inform the factories to increase production as soon as possible, hand over the voucher stock, and provide as much as possible for separate sales. The Chamber of Commerce replied, "It has been repeatedly ordered by the Chamber of Commerce to the Coal Briquette Association to supervise the industry to increase production as much as possible in order to achieve supply and demand balance. As for whether the voucher holders are currently delivering the goods on time, and the failure of the factories to deliver the goods, no reports have been received from the voucher holders. There are only three days left until the deadline. If this is the case, please list the voucher numbers, account names, quantities, and factory names one by one for investigation. It is extremely important. However, it is rumored that many new vouchers have been secretly filled in since the deadline for delivery. It seems that it is too late to stop it now."

### Anti-Smoking and Drinking Campaign - City Federation Responds

The Shanghai Savings and Disaster Relief Committee believes that smoking and drinking not only waste money but also harm health. At a time when prices are high and life is difficult, it is essential to eliminate them. It is advocating an anti-smoking and drinking campaign. The Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation responded to this campaign yesterday and notified the district branches to implement it unanimously. The notice stated briefly that smoking and drinking stimulate nerves and harm health the most. At this time of high prices, everyone should resolutely abstain from this unnecessary consumption. The Savings and Disaster Relief Committee launched the anti-smoking and drinking campaign, which is extremely important. Therefore, a special notice is issued, hoping to widely persuade citizens to implement it unanimously, which is what is hoped for.

### British Public Bus Company - New Substitute Vouchers Issued Again

February Vouchers - Discontinued from Today

The British-owned China General Omnibus Company's February substitute vouchers will be discontinued from today. A new type of yellow hard-quality substitute voucher was specially issued yesterday, printed with the words "In order to facilitate passengers, this voucher is specially issued, priced at 20 cents, and can only be used as a fare on the company's vehicles, valid until June 30, 1940." Each conductor is given 200 sheets per shift (totaling 4 yuan) as change. However, since the circulation of 20 cent denomination notes is quite extensive, the substitute vouchers have not entered the market.

### Tea Server Accidentally Discharges Firearm

Shen Arong, a tea server at the Lianyi Gambling Den Entertainment Club at the intersection of Kangding Road and Yanping Road in Shanghai's West District, accidentally discharged a firearm while playing with a handgun at the foot of the stage around 10 PM the night before. The bullet hit his lower abdomen, and his life is said to be in critical condition.

### Income Tax Office Interpretation - Problem of Supplementary Dividends from Previous Year - Should Be Included in This Year's Income

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce notified the various industry associations yesterday, stating, "Dear Sirs, We have recently received a letter from the Income Tax Office of the Ministry of Finance stating that your association's letter regarding whether a company's lack of profits in the 27th year of the Republic but profits in the 28th year, in addition to paying official interest for that year, still has surplus to pay the unpaid official interest of the 27th year, violates item 17 of the Category 1 Profit Income Tax Collection Notice, which states that the loss of business in the previous year may not be included in the calculation of this year, and requested your office to investigate and reply. The Office approved this. According to item 14 of the Category 1 Income Tax Collection Notice, the following items cannot be considered necessary and reasonable expenses and losses in business. If the taxpayer lists them as expenses, they should be removed when calculating net profit. (1) Interest on capital, etc. When calculating the amount of income, business enterprises are not allowed to deduct dividends in advance. Therefore, if the surplus of this year is used to pay the dividends of the previous year, it will not actually have any impact on the calculation of income tax. However, for profit enterprises organized as companies, since Article 171 of the Company Law stipulates that companies may not distribute dividends without making up for losses, they must have made up for losses before paying supplementary dividends, which is inconsistent with item 17 of the Category 1 Income Tax Collection Notice. The amount of this supplementary dividend and the amount of losses made up should still be included in this year's

calculation of income. We hereby reply accordingly, hoping that you will check this matter and forward it to your affiliated industries for reference and implementation. We look forward to your cooperation."

### Indeed a "Paper Tiger" - Gambling Dens Still Allowed to Operate - Gambling Den Owners Agree to Increase Substantial Donations and Taxes - Japanese Authorities Actually Protect in Every Possible Way

The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reported that the Japanese side ordered the gambling dens in Shanghai's West District to close within a month, which has now become a "paper tiger" situation. The villainous gambling den owner, Shi Gongwei, used both threats and bribes to indefinitely postpone the closure order. According to reliable sources, the gambling den owner has convinced the Japanese authorities in charge of these evil places that there is no "goose that lays the golden eggs" until the agreement on roads beyond the settlement limits is implemented. Some sources even say that the gambling den owner's methods are very effective, causing the negotiations on the agreement on roads beyond the settlement limits to be suspended again. The "Entertainment Salt Supervisory Office" collects donations from each gambling den every month, which originally amounted to a huge sum of one million yuan. However, it is said that in order to postpone the closure order, the gambling den owner has agreed to increase this donation. On the other hand, he condoned his armed thugs to commit crimes in the Shanghai's West District, using this to warn the authorities that if they cut off their "lifeline," the situation in the Shanghai's West District will become even worse. It is said that in the past two weeks, robberies on buses and roads in the Shanghai's West District have also been committed by these thugs. It is also said that the Japanese authorities have allowed the gambling dens to continue operating, and the new conditions implemented are as follows: (1) The gambling dens should do their best to prevent shootings and conflicts from happening, so as not to cause public outcry; (2) The gambling dens should use dance halls, hotels, theaters, or bars as a cover to conceal the truth; (3) The gambling dens must avoid using electric torch signs to attract attention. In short, unless unexpected events such as a direct order from Tokyo occur, the gambling dens will continue to exist.

### Rampant Gambling Disasters in Shanghai's South District

In addition to the prevalence of Huahui gambling in various places in Shanghai's South District, various gambling dens are springing up like mushrooms after rain. The Japanese puppet regime seems to have tacitly approved and openly called for them. There are already as many as six gambling dens that have opened, including Heng'an Company on Nanyang Bridge, Xingfa Company on Wengjia Lane in the Old West Gate, Xieli Company, Shengsheng Company in Pinhua Lane on Anren Street inside the New North Gate, Shixing Company on Fuyou Road, and Xieji Company on Qingyun Street, Niumudi. At the same time, there are two huge gambling dens that are being prepared and will be opened soon, one is Erxin Company at No. 501 Mingguo Road, hosted by Fan, and the other is Dafu Company at No. 725 Zhaojia Road inside Kaoxi Gate, hosted by Gao. There are also Dali Company at No. 31 Xima Street inside Fangbang Bridge, Huasen Company at No. 89 Baoren Lane on Anren Street inside the New North Gate, Fadaer Company on Gaodun Lane, Niumudi, Erlai Company at No. 196 Luxiangyuan Road, Liyuan Club in Jihe Lane, No. 27 Wengjia Lane, and Rongsheng Company in Xiangzheng Lane, No. 141 Jufang Lane, Old West Gate, which are being decorated and will be opened on a selected day. It is difficult to investigate those preparing to open. The future disasters are unimaginable. However, if all citizens restrain themselves and do not move forward, they will inevitably reduce themselves in a short time.

### Late Spring Cold

Spring Snow Falling in Shanghai - Low Pressure System Has Passed Shanghai

In the past two days, the spring cold has been severe in Shanghai. Yesterday afternoon, starting at 1:00 PM, spring snow was falling, and it had not stopped by the evening. It melted as it fell, and there was no accumulation. It has been found that spring snow is particularly unfavorable to agricultural work and will show farmland pests, affecting spring plowing.

Due to the movement of the low-pressure system to the northeast-east, the weather in Shanghai was quite bad. Since the afternoon of the 27th, strong gusts of wind have swept through Shanghai, and the temperature has dropped sharply to about 5 degrees Celsius. Since yesterday morning, the low-pressure system has crossed the Shanghai border and entered the East China Sea, and the wind has subsided. However, the minimum temperature is still only 4 degrees Celsius. Although the rain has stopped, the sky is still very gloomy.

### Liu Zhongying Shot and Killed - Suspect Escorted to Court Yesterday - After a Brief Trial, Ordered to Be Detained for Another Week for Further Investigation

Liu Zhongying, a native of Ningbo, has served as a member of the executive committee of the Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation, a staff member of the citizens' group of the Shanghai Refugee Association, and a member of the Chinese Taxpayers' Association. The Daya Radio Station at No. 545 Huayao Lane, Jiujiang Road, was also run by Liu. At 9:00 AM the day before yesterday, Liu left the Daya Radio Station, intending to go to the Yudechi Bathhouse on Nanjing Road. As he was walking out of Huawan Lane, two men suddenly stepped forward, each with a handgun, blocking Liu's path. One of them fired two shots at Liu, both of which hit him. One bullet hit Liu's throat, and the other hit his chest. He immediately fell to the ground injured. Nearby constables who heard the alarm rushed to the scene and arrested Xiao Yongming (22 years old, resident of No. 25, Lane 80, Beidiqian Road), another man who was acting as a lookout. They also seized a new-style "lotus root" handgun loaded with five bullets and found 34 bullets in Xiao's pocket. He was taken back to the police station along with the handgun and bullets. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the First Criminal Tribunal of the First Special District Court. The police authorities requested that the defendant be temporarily detained pending further investigation. After review by the American judge, Xiao Yongming was ordered to be detained for one week. After Liu was injured, he died due to the severity of his injuries. The body was inspected by the prosecutor of the First Special District Court and ordered to be coffined. The reason for Liu's murder is rumored to be diverse, but according to general observation, it was a vendetta.

Funeral Today: After Liu Zhongying, a member of the Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the Public Concession and a member of the Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation, was tragically assassinated, his remains were moved to the Continental Funeral Home on Haige Road yesterday. The funeral is scheduled for 2:00 PM today.

### Woman Cao Zhao Sues for Support - Wins Case

Cao Zhao, a woman from Ningbo, 31 years old this year, married Cao Sizhong, the young master of Yida Paper Shop on Lao Yong'an Street, through a matchmaker in the 21st year of the Republic. Since their marriage, they have had a son named Haixiang, who is now seven years old. The love between the couple was still considered harmonious. Unexpectedly, good times did not last long. Four years ago, Cao Sizhong suddenly went to his ancestral home in Huizhou and changed his original intention from then on. He actually found a new lover outside, ignoring his original wife. Her living expenses were paid monthly by Cao's father, Weiheng. Recently, Cao Weiheng also stopped paying her living expenses, so she hired lawyer Zhu Hefu to file a lawsuit with the Civil Division of the Second Special Court against Cao Weiheng and Cao Sizhong for support and education expenses. After receiving the complaint, the court, with Judge Li Liang presiding, opened Civil Court 7 for trial. The plaintiff requested the court to award her 20,000 yuan for support and 10,000 yuan for education expenses, for a total of 30,000 yuan. The court said that the defendants could not be located, so they completed the debate by appointing a proxy. The verdict was announced yesterday morning: The defendants should pay the plaintiff 60 yuan per month for living expenses and 25 yuan for education expenses. The litigation costs will be borne by the defendants.

### Frequent Kidnappings in Shanghai's West District - Young Son of Wealthy Merchant Kidnapped - Still Missing

Recently, kidnappings have occurred frequently in Shanghai's West District. The day before yesterday, a kidnapping occurred again in Yongle Village near Caojiabo on Route de Zikawei. The victim was a three-year-old child, so the nature of the case is believed to be extortion. The wealthy Ying family, residing at No. 6 Yongle Village, was getting up to wash around 8:00 AM the day before yesterday. Their three-year-old son was being breastfed by a nanny when several men broke into the house. They were all armed and silenced the family. They snatched the child from the nanny's arms, rushed out of the door, and ran into a car parked at the entrance of Yongle Village Lane, speeding away. Mr. Ying reported to the nearby "puppet police station," and the "puppet police" were sent to investigate the case, but the child's whereabouts are still unknown.

### Fraternal Strife - Zhu Xiaonan Acquitted - Plaintiff's Incidental Civil Suit Also Dismissed

The late traditional Chinese medicine practitioner Zhu Nanshan had two sons, Xiaonan (the elder) and He Gao (the younger). Both inherited their father's profession and practiced medicine at their self-built residence at No. 96 Ai Youyi Road and Changsha Road intersection. Their daily earnings from consultations were distributed and recorded equally according to the contract. However, recently, a rift suddenly developed between the Zhu brothers, leading to fraternal strife.

Fraternal strife: Zhu He Gao first filed a lawsuit against his elder brother, Xiaonan, in the Civil Division of the First Special Court for clearing accounts. Then, he reported his accountant Shen Wendou and Zhu Xiaonan to the police for criminal breach of trust and embezzlement of 201 yuan and 5 jiao in consultation fees. This case has been repeatedly tried by Judge Xiao Peishen of the First Special Court. The defendant Zhu Xiaonan hired lawyer Hong Shihao to appear in court. In addition to making every effort to defend himself, he also submitted

supplemental reasons. His words were thousands of words long. In addition to thoroughly analyzing the details of the case, his conclusion focused on human relations and the world, stating that the defendant Zhu Xiaonan and the plaintiff's father Zhu Nanshan had been bedridden for many years before his death. As the eldest son, the defendant was in charge of the family, and all matters inside and outside the family were handled by the defendant. He was responsible for financial income and expenditure. The bones of the deceased father were not yet cold, and as a fellow compatriot, he did not hesitate to file this unannounced lawsuit. Who has no family in the world? Who has no siblings? If this trend continues, what etiquette and morals will our Chinese descendants have? What families in the country will not be chaotic? At a time when the world is declining and getting worse, it is necessary for the law to correct this. He should be declared innocent. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao ascended the criminal

court and announced the verdict: Shen Wendou and Zhu Xiaonan were innocent. The incidental civil suit, the plaintiff's lawsuit, was dismissed.

### Lu Dacheng Sues Aunt

For Embezzling More Than 600 Mu of Sand Land - Defendant Claims It Was a Gift from Biological Mother

Shi Lu Jingyun, the wife of Chongming's wealthy gentleman Lu Weicheng (resident of No. 215 Fuli Road, French Concession), was recently sued in the Second Special Court by her nephew Lu Dacheng (26 years old, Guanghua University student, resident of No. 4 Xuehua Lane, Xuehuali Road), represented by lawyer Ge Zhiqin,

for embezzlement. The reason for the case is that the defendant Shi Lu Jingyun is applying evidence of immovable property possession and jewelry. In addition to requesting punishment in accordance with the law, she is also submitting a civil suit requesting the return of the evidence and clothing. It has been found that the plaintiff inherited all the assets of his deceased father, Jianchang, and discovered that some key documents were missing, including Chongming Ping'an Sand Land, two qing one mu and three hao, and the seal of Qidong Yongfeng Sand Land, four qing 97 mu and six fen. The household registration books

were searched everywhere but could not be found. After detailed investigation with the grain counters of each county, it was found that the fields in Chongming, Qidong, and other places had been changed to the name of Shi Lu Jingyun. It has been found that the defendant Shi Lu Jingyun is the plaintiff's aunt, namely the daughter of Lu Sunshi, the concubine of the plaintiff's grandfather Nianqiao. Lu Sunshi was the plaintiff's step-grandmother. When the plaintiff's step-grandmother was alive, she often lived in the defendant's house, so she took the valuable jewelry and

business documents to the defendant's house and handed them over to the defendant for safekeeping. After the death of the plaintiff's step-grandmother, the defendant held the documents in his possession and claimed that the plaintiff's step-grandmother had debts before her death, and the plaintiff had to pay off the debts before the items could be returned. The plaintiff had no choice but to pay, but the defendant still embezzled the above-mentioned fields. The court should summon the defendant to the court and punish him for embezzlement. The court approved the complaint. Yesterday, Judge Wu summoned the parties for trial. The defendant commissioned a

lawyer to appear and claimed that the two sand lands in Chongming and Qidong were given to the defendant by Lu Sunshi and there is evidence to prove it. He asked the court to allow a postponement. Today, the defendant is sick and did not attend, so the evidence could not be collected. After reviewing the situation, the court instructed to wait for a postponement of the trial.

Judge Xiao Peishen presided over the trial, which concluded with the order for Wu to be detained and a judgment scheduled for March 4.

### A Sick Man's Sorrow in Spring

Spring arrives, and flowers are about to bloom, how should a loving couple arrange their affairs?

Only because of impotence and weakness, precious youth is wasted!

Wasting youth, this is the saddest thing! Because how much youth does a person have in life? We barely have time to cherish it, how can we allow it to be wasted? Therefore, it is said, "Pluck the flower when it is time to pluck, don't wait until there are no flowers and break the branch in vain." Adult men and women, when they have the opportunity and vitality to talk about love, they must enjoy the happiness of love, which is what life should be about. But true love must be based on health. Vitality is what I mean. If a man has committed self-pollution and nocturnal emission in his early years, or has indulged in sex in early marriage, or has suffered from excessive worry and labor, depleting the endocrine fluid in his reproductive glands, or has damaged his sexual nerves, then impotence, incomplete development, kidney deficiency and infertility, back pain, neurasthenia, premature aging, and other symptoms will be endless. Such a sick man, even with a flower-like lover, will not have a fulfilling marital life on a beautiful spring night, or it will be like a flash in the pan, or even a failure, unable to perform his conjugal duty. How can this not arouse the hatred of his wife? In this world, many couples have their love broken because of this, leading to tragedies such as turning against each other, elopement, and divorce! The number is truly countless!

Sick men who want to cure their symptoms, enhance their love with their wives, and regain the happiness they should enjoy in life, it is not a difficult task in today's era of medical advancement. However, one must never乱服用春药与杂药. For taking aphrodisiacs is like whipping a tired horse, and it will eventually collapse and become irreparable. Taking miscellaneous drugs will only lead to wasted money, little effect, or even delay the opportunity for treatment! According to world-renowned doctors and our experience, taking the gonadotropic hormone preparation "Shengzhi Su" is the most effective treatment, because this agent is based on the most effective supplementation therapy principle in new medicine, taking the endocrine essence of gonads from robust animals such as monkeys, apes, gorillas, lions, tigers, bears, deer, sea dogs, etc., and refined by scientific cloning, so the quality is precious, the tonic power is great, and it is beyond any similar preparation. After a man takes "Shengzhi Su", he can produce sperm and nourish the kidneys, strengthen the brain and invigorate the blood, nourish the nerves, and promote development in one day and night. Continuing to take it continuously will surely cure all symptoms in a short period of time, making energy doubled. Middle-aged and elderly people often take it to prolong life, delay aging, and rejuvenate. Only those with nocturnal emission need to take the special medicine for treating nocturnal emission, "Hope Detachable Solid Essence Tablets" (available at major pharmacies such as Zhongxi Wuzhou and the Western Medicine Department of Wing On Company, priced at 2 yuan per box).

Patient Zheng Liangjun suffered from severe kidney deficiency and impotence after marriage, and also had nocturnal emission. This caused his appearance to wither and his relationship with his wife to worsen. A month ago, he was introduced by a friend to our clinic for treatment. We immediately instructed him to buy a dozen bottles of "Shengzhi Su" and three boxes of "Hope Detachable Solid Essence Tablets" and take them together. In less than a month, he has recovered completely, his energy is abundant, and the love between him and his wife is better than when they were newly married.

Beauty and Health

### What Could Be More Shameful! Suffering Annoyance Because of Withered and Shrunken Breasts!

— Dr. Yao Chongpei, American Medical Doctor

Since the call for women to have healthy beauty spread to every city, the sickly Xi Shi who only cared about脂粉衣饰装点 have been abandoned by society, and there is no room for them to插足 in social scenes. Not only that, but also because of their various physical defects, such as withered breasts, thin buttocks, withered muscles,憔悴容颜, etc., even in the family, they cannot avoid all kinds of刺戟. Now, let’s give one example of a recent letter of inquiry. Smart girls should have some悟悟了, the original text is as follows: "... to say my environment, there are many servants at home, cars come and go, and the exquisite clothing and enjoyment can be said to be the ultimate in human wealth. In theory, I should know how to be satisfied. What is there to be annoyed about? But in fact, because I have been病病多痛痛since I was a child, I am now suffering from irregular menstruation, leucorrhea, dizziness, abdominal pain, and神倦. There are very few healthy days throughout the year, and what I especially regret is that due to the constant invasion of the病厂, my appearance has become憔悴, my muscles withered, my buttocks thin, and my breasts are especially withered and pitiful. No matter how I dress up, when people see me, I don’t know why, they always竊竊私議. A quick-mouthed relative even called me "老枪寡老" behind my back, and "椒盐排骨" and "乾癟老太婆" seem to have become proper terms in the mouths of the servants. I am really發昏 when I hear this kind of譏訥, but what is the use of發昏? Alas! At the age of花信, I still have no ideal partner, and my youth is wasted, can I not... " In Miss Mou's environment, her encounters are like this, so the tragic fate of others who are not as well off as her can be imagined. However, in this day and age, science is omnipotent, and this kind of defect is also very easy to make up for. The main reason for乳瘍颜衰 is entirely due to the dysfunction of the ovaries, which affects metabolism. At this time, if you take the ovary preparation for women, "Shengzhi Su," which is a good medicine for the right symptom, it will not be difficult to eliminate the above symptoms in a short period of time, so that the body becomes stronger day by day, then the breasts will naturally be high and the cheeks will naturally be rosy. If you continue to take it, you can also prolong life and驻驻青春.

### The Plan for the Year Lies in Spring; The Youth of Nocturnal Emission Should Wake Up Quickly

— Dr. Zhan Nianceng, Specialist in Venereal Diseases

At this time of spring, when all things are sprouting, it is time for us to work hard in time. If you continue to be confused, you will waste a year, or even miss your life! Therefore, we must鍛练着身体 and make it strong, so as to lay the foundation for the happiness of our future. However, young people are most likely to commit self-pollution and纵欲等行为 during this spring, when春情發動, thus,斵伤了性神经, causing精关松弛,爆发着遗精症. If young people suffering from遗精症 do not cure it quickly in this spring, it is even more dangerous! Because after the spring warms up, the精关 will become more and more松弛, and it is very easy to change from light symptoms of night emission to dangerous symptoms of滑精漏精症, or because of the lack of精液 in the body, the脑, 性, 春髓 and other nerves will show a high degree of衰弱, the developmental function will stagnate, and the metabolic function will decrease. Thus, symptoms such as脑衰健忘, 失眠心悸, 腰痠背痛, 早洩阳痿, 发育不全, 未老先衰 will occur. How can this kind of病态靑年 study his academics, develop his career, and create his great future! Moreover, how can he be loved by women and欢悦 by his wives and concubines, thus losing love, losing歡悅, and falling into a tragic situation in life!

If young people can wake up early,遗精症 is not an incurable disease. The method of treatment is to清心寡欲,戒绝自凟, and at the same time take the special medicine for treating遗, "Hope Detachable Solid Essence Tablets" (sold at major pharmacies such as Zhongxi Zhongying, priced at 2 yuan per box) to固精关 and镇静神经. Patients can receive the special effects of sleeping and stopping遗 when they take it that night. If there are already the above symptoms due to遗精, you must also take gonadotropic hormone preparation "Shengzhi Su" to培补脑肾, 增益精血, and take it for a month to必可收却病强身之功. If patients can come to our clinic for diagnosis and treatment in person, we can guarantee a cure.

### Academia Sinica Benefits Various University Science and Chemistry Experiments by Manufacturing Instruments and Selling Them to Schools at Reduced Prices; Sino-American and Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Funds Assist in Its Success

(Kunming Special Dispatch) In order to promote the advancement of scientific research, the National Academia Sinica, recognizing that various schools have relocated to the interior after the war and that it is not easy to purchase foreign exchange, making it difficult to obtain physical and chemical instruments and supplies, has manufactured physical and chemical instruments for middle schools and has received financial assistance from the Sino-American and Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Fund Boards. Therefore, it is able to manufacture a complete set of physical and chemical instruments for middle schools and sell them to schools at half the cost.

### Current Situation of Jinling University After Moving West

Jinling Women's College of Arts and Sciences Holds 24th Anniversary Celebration

(Chengdu Correspondent) Since Jinling University moved here from Nanjing, everything has been progressing step by step and developing day by day. From the autumn of the 27th year to the summer of the 28th year, a total of 506 students were registered, including 323 in the university department, 89 in the agricultural specialty, and a total of 94 in other auditing students and special students. A total of 514 students were registered in the spring, including 365 in the university department, 66 in the agricultural search, 12 in the electrical specialty, and a total of 10 students in auditing students and remedial students. There were 51 substitute teachers from Huada, Jin Nuda, and Qida. There are a total of 196 faculty and staff members, including 12 who remained in Nanjing to guard the school. The funds are 83% of the highest annual amount in Nanjing. In terms of business, in addition to the normal operation of various professional courses in the two colleges, new businesses include the Anti-Japanese War History of the College of Liberal Arts, slide cataloging, and the Survey of Handicrafts in Sichuan Province. The College of Science added two specialized courses in electrification and automobiles, focusing on the use of copper, soda, sulfuric acid, and insecticides in Sichuan Province to study the nutritional composition of agricultural products in Sichuan Province, and to study lightning chemical reactions. There are also new directions and new efforts in film education, wireless machine parts, and slides. The College of Agriculture has added 51 new research projects and promoted them separately in the three designated promotion areas. The affiliated middle school of the school is located in Wanxian with 512 students. The Chinese and Western professors who remained at the Nanjing school's office have been engaged in refugee relief work since the winter before, and in the autumn, they successively opened Yuling Remedial School and Work-Study School. The refugee treatment and emergency work of Gulou Hospital have not stopped since the school moved in the year before last. The school opened in the autumn of the 18th year and enrolled a total of 206 new students. There were 578 new and old students, and the three colleges of liberal arts, science, and agriculture offered a total of 196 courses. There were 273 faculty and staff members. In terms of funding, it is now possible to restore the highest annual budget in Nanjing. Yuling Women's College of Arts and Sciences celebrated its 24th anniversary in Chengdu in November last year. The school is now revising the organization outline of the college's administration in accordance with the resolution of the first National Education Conference to standardize the national administrative organization methods of colleges and universities above junior college level. The college has always attached importance to home economics courses, and now it is jointly running the home economics department with the Women's College of Huada. The goals are two: (1) to focus on family management and family economics; (2) to focus on food nutrition and hygiene. Among the various departments of the school, the Department of Sociology is the most developed. The Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Fund Board has subsidized a professorship with a salary of 3,000 yuan to help the department develop. The original school in Nanjing retained some faculty and staff in Nanjing to maintain it. Initially, a women's shelter was set up to accommodate more than 10,000 women and children who had suffered. It ended at the end of May last year. After the end, a vocational training class was set up for women who had difficulty in life, and technicians were hired to teach them skills so that they could be self-reliant. The class has been very effective, and all the products are welcomed by all parties. The society has this need, so the vocational department was continued in the autumn to create a great cause. In addition, because there are not a few young women who cannot have a place to study, an experimental department was added to teach junior high school students to help them. Both departments are quite developed and are still continuing to run.

### Grains: Rice Merchants' Speculative Hearts Die Hard; Although Imported Rice Arrivals Are Strong, Rice Prices Still Rise

Recently, rice prices have been declining all the way. The price of No. 1 Saigon rice sold for 43.5 yuan, a difference of only 0.5 yuan compared to the closing price of 43 yuan last year.  The huge price increase of 9 yuan within the "red zone" was completely erased, a fortunate occurrence for the people's food supply.  However, at noon, due to steady gold prices and tighter exchange rates, sentiment rebounded.  General floating speculative accounts once again accumulated stocks, causing a reversal.  Yesterday, there were still lingering effects at the opening, although the outflow was normal.  However, traders holding goods believed that pricing based on the origin had become difficult to align.  Regardless of the quantity of goods in transit or the availability of funds, they suppressed their desire to profit from scarcity. Unanimously, they held onto their goods, unwilling to easily release them. Floating speculative clients, deeply understanding the situation, refrained from selling, resulting in very limited turnover in the market.  Therefore, those wishing to buy had to rely on their decisions.  At noon, local stores, seeing the market rebound after a sharp fall, seized the opportunity to purchase, immediately driving up market prices.  Closing prices for all types of imported rice were about 0.5 yuan higher than the previous market.  No. 1 Saigon rice, after hearing of 44.5 yuan in the morning, was directly sold at 45.5 yuan, with fluctuations reaching 1 yuan.  No. 2 rice was sold from 42.3 yuan to 43 yuan.  Fire-grained pointed rice closed at 44 yuan.  March futures original package was 51.5 yuan, spot price was 40.06 to 42.5 yuan per dan.  Tokyo pointed rice was as high as 41.5 yuan, followed by 40.05 yuan, with the lowest grade like brown rice at only 39 yuan.  Mixed broken rice ranged from 34.5 yuan to 33 yuan.  As for domestic glutinous rice, with a lower base price, it attracted attention as soon as the market turned, and prices were easily raised.  Therefore, the price of domestic glutinous rice rose by about 1.5 yuan, but Hong Kong imported glutinous rice only followed imported rice with an increase of about 0.5 yuan.  Early and late season japonica rice and other domestic rice varieties were rumored to have secretly risen by more than one yuan in off-market transactions, and Kunshan Zhen specialty japonica rice, due to scarcity, was particularly popular, selling for as much as 53 yuan, while medium grades were still only 47-48 yuan, special thin indica rice was 48 yuan, and early and late season indica rice was 46 yuan. Only 400-500 bags of early and late season Nan Gang rice arrived from the interior, transferred from Hongkou into the concession.

Imported rice, under the pressure of congested arrivals and large amounts of capital, rebounded once after being absorbed by speculative accounts the day before yesterday. Yesterday morning, it fell again due to the competitive blocking by floating accounts, especially with abundant arrivals of both current and forward rice. The situation was softest. In the early market, all rice varieties fell by about 0.5 yuan, but then were taken in by speculative accounts on the opportunity of the small price, and the current and forward rice were raised by nearly a yuan. The digestion of February and March futures was more greedy, and in the afternoon continued to rise. Xiaowen rose from 51 yuan to 51.5 yuan, No. 2 Siam rice rose from 52 yuan to 52.35 yuan, No. 2 Saigon rice rose from 52 yuan to 52.8 yuan, and the turnover of futures hedging transactions also increased to 1,535 tons.

Imported rice is arriving in succession. Danish-owned Jiecheng Shipping Line's Meihe wheel, transported more than 30,000 bags directly from Saigon, arrived in port at around 8 AM the day before yesterday (the 27th), docked at Qichang Pier in Pudong to unload. Also, the Zhizhibisha, a ship specially dispatched by the Java Post Shipping Company to Saigon to load rice, was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai today, but we now know that it entered port at around 3 PM yesterday, docking at the Blue Funnel Wharf in Pudong. In addition to more than 20,000 bags of imported rice loaded from Saigon, the ship also carried 1,500 tons of pearl rice (i.e., corn), also loaded from Saigon, and unloading began today. (Zu)

After the Wuxi rice market established a public sales office, disorder occurred due to chaotic order, and rice snatching incidents occurred. Most markets were closed. Later, they continued to handle the sale of white rice at a flat price of 25 yuan per shi (unit of volume). The rice market tea party started on the morning of the day before yesterday, and normal trading resumed. The supply of rice boats and the sample packages issued by the warehouses also increased, but buyers were very scarce, resulting in oversupply. The market price of rice immediately plummeted by 1 yuan to 0.5 or 0.6 yuan. The opening price for high-grade brown japonica rice was 26 yuan to 25.7-8 yuan per shi, while the market price for brown japonica rice was 25.35 yuan, a drop of 1.3-5 yuan compared to before the market closure. Japonica rice per dan fell from 14 yuan to as low as 13.2-3 yuan, a drop of nearly 1 yuan compared to the highest price. Many opportunistic factories purchased as much as possible. The opening of the forward market was aided by the news that several hundred bags of white rice were opened in the afternoon of the day before yesterday, together with the settlement reached by the former Rice Federation, immediately shifting sentiment. In addition, apportionment led factories with only Xian Yuan indica rice and miscellaneous grains to replenish japonica rice and brown japonica rice in the market. Retail stores also slightly replenished rice for sale to meet demand. As a result, the rice market turned strong again, trending upward by several jiao (tenths of a yuan) at any time. On the 26th, the market opened with several hundred shi of high-grade white japonica rice priced at 29 yuan, high-grade brown japonica rice at 27.35 yuan, market high-grade brown japonica rice at 27 yuan, japonica rice at 13.735 yuan per dan, and Yuan indica rice at 14 yuan. The Rice Federation has been very busy recently with the apportionment, remittance, and settlement of white rice purchased from Japanese merchants and various flat-price sales. (Zhi)

### Flour Tends to Slacken

The flour market tended to slacken yesterday. It has been confirmed that Flour Factory No. 1 has been selling at a fixed price of 10 yuan for a long time without any changes. Because rice prices have fallen recently and demand is still comparable, the real sales in this area are temporarily quiet, and customers are even less active. Therefore, sentiment is weak and the market is inevitably affected by the returned goods. It is heard that the initial opening price for the Lao Che Pai warehouse was 14.5-6 yuan, but then fell to 14.4 yuan, 0.2 yuan lower than the previous day. Green Cannon and Warship brands were also lacking in regular market activity due to the quietness of the customer base.

Wheat: Yesterday's trading was acceptable. Both Suzhou and Bengbu wheat were traded for a total of ten carts, still bought by Japanese factories. Due to the recent fall in flour prices, a few shops are willing to sell, but the current stock is limited, making it difficult to cross, so the opening price is still around 25 yuan, a slight drop from the previous day.

Goldsmiths' Gold Prices Stay Fixed

The selling price of gold jewelry in gold shops remained fixed throughout the day. Da Tong Heng still posted 485 yuan per tael, and the new shops had the same price. The buying price was reduced by about 10 yuan.

### Foreign Currencies Firm and Steady

Yesterday, the British and American gold pounds were soft due to limited demand. British gold notes were still stable at first, with a morning price of 55 yuan. In the afternoon, demand rebounded, and the market was strong, with an evening price of 55.3 yuan. The supply and demand for US dollar notes was balanced, and the whole day's process was stable, with an evening price still at 14.53 yuan. Hong Kong dollars and Singapore dollars were very quiet and stable, with no price fluctuations. The market price for travelers' needs for French francs and Annam dollars was slightly firm. The Philippines peso market was weak and slightly loose. The Japanese gold note was slightly higher, with an evening price of 1.295 yuan. The Korean dollar, on the other hand, was loose and cheap, with an evening price of 1.025 yuan. Yesterday's market prices: British and American gold pounds both fell by 0.05 yuan, British gold notes rose by 0.03 yuan, French francs rose by 0.001 yuan, Annam dollars rose by 0.005 yuan, Philippines dollars fell by 0.05 yuan, Philippines dollars fell by 0.03 yuan, and other currencies were unchanged.

### Discount Rate Rises Sharply: Total Increase of 18 Yuan in Three Days

Yesterday, the discount rate for drafts continued to rise. The discount rate per 1,000 yuan once approached 80 yuan, really due to the tightness of funds, leading to speculation. In the morning, 68 yuan rose to 79 yuan, and in the afternoon it slightly returned to 74.5 yuan, in the afternoon it was 75 yuan, 7 yuan higher than the previous day. The increase has been 18 yuan in total for three consecutive days. The rate of interbank lending by the Money Trade Association has not changed, and was 0.12 yuan in both the morning and afternoon markets.

### Money Shops Raise Lending Rates

Due to recent market conditions and tighter funds, money shops in this city have reportedly decided to increase the interest rate on loans from 10.5 yuan per 1,000 yuan per month to 12 yuan.

### Foreign Exchange Buyers Waiting and Watching

Yesterday's dark market situation for real gold ingots was soft again, returning to the 4,800 yuan mark. Sentiment was unable to recover, partly due to reports of Germany's renewed mediation in the Sino-Japanese War, and partly due to difficult liquidity conditions. As a result, it fell by more than 10 yuan. The ordinary trading at the opening was slow, falling by 15 yuan to 4,790 yuan, due to gold shops and securities firms selling. Later, with some support from Hong Kong firms, it slightly rebounded. However, the foreign exchange suddenly reported weakness, and money changers resisted, coupled with continued selling by securities firms, and a certain bank also sold, immediately falling to a low of 4,772 yuan. Subsequently, a certain bank suddenly bought on behalf of another client, and cash houses frequently purchased, and also the exchange rate soon reported to return to normal, gradually pulling up more than 20 yuan, once reaching 4,798 yuan. Later, as gold shops continued to sell, it closed at 4,790 yuan. The foreign exchange market was closed in the afternoon, and the situation was more stable, closing early. However, the result was a further small drop of 2 yuan due to retail sales, to 4,788 yuan, a decrease of 17 yuan from the previous day. The total transaction was over 1,000 taels. The price of gold jewelry in gold shops was fixed, and customs gold was still stable.

The fall in gold ingots was still small.

From the opening in the morning, due to negative news reports, the gold shops took the lead in shouting to sell, and then the securities firms also competed to sell, and the opening price was down 15 yuan. The gold shops sold 50 taels to a certain bank for 4,790 yuan. After a while, a certain gold shop suddenly bought more than 100 taels on behalf of a Hong Kong firm, and then it rebounded by 5 yuan, buying 20 taels from a peer for 4,795 yuan. Later, because the foreign exchange reported weakness, the securities firms and money changers resumed selling, and at the same time, a certain bank also sold on behalf of customers, and the Hong Kong firms had stopped buying, and fell another 23 yuan. The securities firms sold 30 taels of gold for 4,772 yuan. Later, a certain bank suddenly dragged in retail investors, and a certain cash house frequently purchased, and also the exchange rate soon reported to return to normal, and the rise was seen again. A certain gold shop bought 10 taels from a money changer, as high as 4,798 yuan. At noon, the buying wind gradually subsided, and the gold shops continued to sell, and then fell by a small 8 yuan, with the gold shops doing 30 taels with each other, and a midday closing price of 4,790 yuan. In the afternoon, the gold house first sold 10 taels to the bank for 4,790 yuan. Later, a certain bank sold on behalf of retail investors, and the steps pressed 6 yuan. A certain bank sold 10 taels to a money changer, retreating to 4,784 yuan. After entering, the money changer made a slight buy-in, and recovered 4 yuan, and the money changer did 30 taels with each other, for a late closing price of 4,788 yuan. As a result, it fell by 17 yuan compared with the previous day, and the up and down of the whole day was only 26 yuan. The selling price of the cash house's own brand gold was several yuan higher than that of the gold ingots, and the purchase was reduced by 20 yuan, and the current bid gold was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and all were seldom done.

Foreign Exchange Buyers Waiting and Watching

Yesterday's foreign exchange market conditions, HSBC's listing price, had no up and down. The situation in the dark market for British and American exchange was slightly relaxed at first, and then returned to a normal level. It was reported that Germany intends to try again to mediate in the Sino-Japanese war, which caused speculators to stop buying and turn to wait and see. By half-day, the morning opening was still 4 office 140625 and 6.8125, and the later market was once silent. It was not until about 10 o'clock that the Hong Kong telegram suddenly came to sell, and the buyers had a weak appetite, and the situation was slightly hardened, and grew to 4 office 15625 and 6.84375. Afterwards, it was still for a long time until after 11 o'clock, when Jin Bang suddenly came to pull in the three-month U.S. exchange, and Jia Qian changed industries also had to settle the U.S. dollar bill, the market was flat, and the noon market was scarce, and the state was calm. Until the noon closing, it was still 4 office 14065 and 6.8125, the same as the evening closing yesterday. The futures trend is the same as the spot.

After Jin Bang Settled, It Returned to Level

In the early morning, the London Big Bar was flat and far shrunk by 0.0625. The price of silver in New York was still flat. The London Gold Exchange was stable.

The bank's morning opening spot selling price was 4 office 140625 for British gold and 6.8125 for American exchange. Compared with the previous collection, there was no honor or disgrace. After opening, the state was stable and lacked vitality. When HSBC's listing was announced without moving, the announcement of the white silver balance tax also did not rise or fall. Since then, a Chinese firm suddenly sold on behalf of Hong Kong, so the potential has been slightly hardened. It is estimated that the Hong Kong telegram sold a certain line of spot U.S. exchange 6.84375 to the profitable. At the same time, foreign firms did spot British gold 4 office 156 25 with each other. Afterwards, there was a period of stability, and when Jin Bang suddenly absorbed around 11 o'clock, the market was flat. It is estimated that Jin Bang absorbed 3-month U.S. exchanges 6.75 and 71875 from Huabi and other foreign firms.

French Oriental Bank of Commerce, for the convenience of Chongqing's frightened people to exchange, has established a branch in Chongqing. With the special approval of the Ministry of Finance, it was established on February 10. The manager is the legal person Dumen.

### Securities, Domestic Debt Brewing

The black market for securities was even more chaotic yesterday. Although there were messages from Germany planning to try again to mediate the Sino-Japanese war, it was no longer valued by the market. The crux of the problem is simply that funds are too tight and capitalists have no power, so it is even more deserted. However, the potential power of brewing to change still exists and should not be ignored, because the big players are supporting each other, and have not been shaken. Yesterday's two markets, the price was extremely stable, the up and down to the micro, but the table repeatedly in and out, only Yuan Kang and No. 16 slightly bought in, Zhongyi Runli and Jiu Feng and other slightly sold out, and the rest are sporadic embellishments. As a result, it slightly recovered by 0.05 yuan to 0.1 to 0.2 yuan, and the number of transactions was about 400,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below.

Stock trading, the number of transactions reached 20 shares of Dafeng Yarn Factory, the price was 100 yuan. It was also heard that 20 shares of the Bank of China were traded, and the price was 65 yuan.

The potential of the stock market of the Public Works Bureau is slightly weaker, and the buyer's orders are easy to complete, but there is no real pressure from the sellers. The shares of Hui Defeng are still strong, standing firm at 109.5 yuan. The shares of Yihua Yarn Factory have good demand at a price of 42 yuan. Rubber stocks are still dim, except for the Griez Rubber Trust and the land list, there is little interest in other stocks.

Baoan Insurance shares rose 1.5 pounds to 28 pounds. Kaiping Coal Mine bearer shares rose 6 pence to 18 shillings, and the rest were flat.

### Yarn and Flowers, March Futures Yarn, Approaching the 900 Yuan Mark

The yarn continues to rise, and the situation is still stable. This is because raw cotton and various opening fees are expensive, which has led to an increase in the cost of the factory, so the yarn factory has no intention of selling yarn, so the sentiment is excited, and the March futures yarn is bought in one after another. At the same time, the sales of yarn from various gangs in South China have gradually improved, and the market has become more prominent. The highest price in March was 895 yuan.

The morning market for the current yarn is slightly flat, because there is no major change in foreign cotton and gold prices. The opening price of 20-count double horse yarn is 865 yuan, and the March futures price is 885 yuan. As soon as this price opened, the buyers slightly increased, the table wind tightened, and slowly reached 8734 yuan, and the March futures price was 895 yuan. Although there were those who made a profit in the middle, the momentum was still strong. It is estimated that the half-day turnover was 2,145 bags, and the price of 20-count double horse yarn rose by 6 yuan to 10 yuan. The amount of each gang's purchase is listed on the left, peers 1, 900 Hong Kong 245 Statistics 1, 145.

### Although the Factory Office Is Silent, the Price of Cotton Is Still Fixed

The trading of this cotton is still considered not thin, but the factory is still less purchasing, but the peer-to-peer transactions are particularly lively, the sentiment is firm, and the market price is stable. However, foreign cotton is also in a swirl, but the exchange market is not loose, so it is still difficult to count. 1,218 bags of Tonghua arrived in Subei in the afternoon. The situation of the current cotton is listed on the left.

Another message The price of foreign cotton, the New York cotton market first rose yesterday due to good Liverpool calls, and then returned to a small level due to mass sales and the sale of a part of the reverse limit price. As a result, the closing price was slightly lower than the previous day 3-5 pounds. The Indian cotton market has been very prosperous recently. Yesterday, together with the forecast, it rose by another 4 rupees. Egypt fell more than 10 pounds.

The trading of foreign cotton in Shanghai has been very stable recently. Various industries are very enthusiastic, but due to the tight capital, the amount of transactions has been greatly reduced, and the factory's purchase intention is very weak. A large number of previously ordered goods have also arrived, and 40,000 bags of American cotton will arrive this week. The factory price converted to US exchange 6.8125 in yesterday's cotton market is as follows.

### Piece Goods, March Futures Have Opened, Local Customer Sales Are Active, Selling Prices Are Mostly Higher

Domestic Cloth The February futures market for cotton cloth was full yesterday, and the price in March was 0.5 yuan to 1 yuan higher per piece than in the month, so the local street is quite interested in the current pad. The selling price of white goods has risen by about 0.05 yuan per piece. Dyed and printed yarn money cloth has risen by 0.5 yuan to 0.75 yuan per piece. The local street has traded more than 500 bags of white goods, coarse and fine twill gray cloth, and more than 300 pieces of dyed and printed cloth.

Cloth The prices of white goods and colored goods continued to rise uniformly. The morning market for Longtou fine cloth was flat, but the market rose again, and the current price was 26.95 yuan per piece. Other middle and lower grades also jumped up by about 0.25 yuan per piece. Sijunzi poplin is especially smart, and the current price is already selling for 0.815 yuan per yard, and 0.84 yuan next month.

### Oil Market, Soybean Oil Returned to 1 Yuan in the Afternoon

Recently, the oil market has been restricted by various environmental factors, and the lack of real sales has led to a lack of sentiment. The market has been trimmed, and soybean oil has fallen by 3 yuan again, and peanut oil has continued to fall by 0.2 yuan. Suddenly, in the afternoon, the mainland office came to ask, and the price rose by about 1 yuan again. As a result, a total of 60 barrels of Dalian crude oil were traded, the price was 111 yuan to 112 yuan, 20 barrels of Jiangbei oil, the price was 108.5 yuan, 10 barrels of Hankou oil, the price was 110.05 yuan, and 80 barrels of green and peanut oil, the price was 114 yuan to 113 yuan.

### Coal, White Coal Clearly Fixed and Secretly Cheap

The selling party in the white coal market has a firm mind, but once the spring order is handed over, the sales market is inevitably sluggish, and the hands of the stilt-up are gradually released, which is a fierce kill for the local street, so the door price is also loose. Kaihongji lift block is 190 yuan per ton, sieve block is 180 yuan, and Tong is 175 yuan. Haifeng white coal is still prosperous due to the need for shop liquidation, so it still supports the original market.

### Terminally Ill

— Huang Jiayin

The obvious signs of social illness, the complexity of the condition, and the severity of the situation no longer allow us to avoid seeking medical attention.

The corpses lying east and west, the starving people in the streets and alleys, and the endless cases of rice snatching all prove that treating social diseases is urgent.

In today's era of soaring prices, the phenomenon of social contradictions has reached its peak. On the one hand, we see starving people and bandits, and on the other hand, we see speculators hoarding rice, flour, and coal, leaving them unused.

The greatest purpose of producing rice, flour, and coal is to increase the happiness of the masses and to be utilized by everyone. But that's not the case now. The current social system has embarked on a dead end like a bull's horn, making these daily necessities tools for merchants to profit, commodities for speculative manipulation; making most of the food and fuel hoarded waste, while at the same time making most of the people live on the line between hunger and cold.

Is a social system that traps the majority of innocent people in a life of poverty reasonable? Is it reasonable to allow a few people to lead excessively luxurious lives, while at the same time holding the power to control the fate of the majority, hoarding essential items and letting the majority of the unfortunate struggle under a tragic destiny? Can such a society be said to have no problems?

Let me tell you, our society is terminally ill!

Psychology

### Only Child

— Wen He

Parents' love for their children is innate; however, only children are often especially spoiled. This phenomenon is particularly prominent in China because the Chinese traditionally believe in carrying on the family line. Since the responsibility of an only child is exceptionally significant, parents tend to cherish them even more. These only children receive abnormally indulgent education during their youth, and their personality development is bound to differ from that of ordinary children. After they reach adulthood, they no longer have parents to pamper them, and their lives may also differ from others. The Chinese have generally overlooked these issues. Here, we introduce a report researched by an American psychologist, Mr. Burleigh.

Mr. Burleigh studied four hundred only children or spoiled children who had already reached adulthood. The youngest was eighteen years old, and the oldest was sixty-eight years old. Among them, 172 were male and 228 were female. He discovered a common phenomenon among these individuals: they all found it difficult to compete with others in the struggle for survival. They were all cared for and nurtured by their mothers, so they all lacked independence and self-confidence.

Only children mingle with adults from a young age, often maturing early. As they grow older, they are not accustomed to socializing with people of similar age. They can be said to have few friends and cannot adapt to their society.

When only children have any requests, their parents always grant them. When they make mistakes, their parents do not discipline them. As a result, after they grow up, even a slight disregard from others can make them feel sad for days or even weeks. One only daughter, who attended a gathering with a close friend, attempted suicide out of anger because her friend received more attention than she did at the event.

Only children do not experience competition from siblings, and it seems as if they are in charge of everything in the family. They are accustomed to hearing praise from others from a young age, leading them to feel that they are the most important person in the world. Not only are they conceited, but they are also extremely jealous. They are envious of the happiness of their relatives and friends, so people find them annoying. No wonder they are depressed.

Because only children are spoiled by their parents, their emotional energy is difficult to transfer to the opposite sex, resulting in abnormal love lives. In Mr. Burleigh's statistics of four hundred people, 36 percent had unusual love lives. Some were homosexuals, voyeurs, exhibitionists, sadists, masochists, etc. Eighteen percent suffered from various types of "early decline syndrome," meaning they were not far from being insane.

An example of a historically spoiled and overindulged only child is the Roman tyrant Nero. However, only children who are not spoiled can develop like ordinary children and are likely to excel. For example, China's great sage Confucius was an only child and can serve as a representative of well-educated only children.

Anecdotes

### Mr. Wells's Verbal Battle with Lord Haw-Haw

— Hua Zhi

Recently, two Mr. Wellses have gained international prominence. One is the US Secretary of State, who was sent to Europe to investigate the four countries of Britain, France, Germany, and Italy and make recommendations, serving as a peace envoy. However, the other, a British historical writer famous for his book "The Shape of Things to Come," is a god of war.

The writer Wells recently engaged in a verbal battle with the German speaker Lord Haw-Haw, which attracted much attention. The facts are as follows: Wells recently published an article in the authoritative American magazine "Free World," echoing George Bernard Shaw's proposal that the stalemate on the front lines is depressing, and that the British Air Force should bomb Berlin on a large scale. He wrote, "I am a pacifist, but a true one. Germany's actions not only disrupt the world but also hinder the wheel of evolution, so we must bomb them. Bombing is a method that Germany used to inflict suffering on other nations, and now we want them to taste the fruits of their actions."

Wells's remarks immediately garnered attention and aroused the indignation of the German commentator Lord Haw-Haw. Lord Haw-Haw is the only eloquent speaker on German radio, fluent in English. Every evening, he uses radio waves to lecture the British public, discussing the merits and demerits of British politics. Upon hearing Wells's remarks, he threatened the British public, saying, "If a bomb falls on Berlin, we will retaliate with ten bombs on London. I advise the British not to be reckless, because the cruelty of our retaliatory measures is beyond the imagination of a historian like Wells."

Someone asked Wells for his thoughts on Lord Haw-Haw's provocation. He did not care, saying that it was a sign of Germany's weakness and a frightened cry. If the Germans had courage, they would have dared to bomb England when they bombed Warsaw last September. "In short, I think it is better to bomb them to death than to starve them to death by naval blockade. This method is direct and allows them to clear their minds sooner."

Wells's passionate remarks were indeed welcomed and excited by the general public; however, as of now, those in political circles who are cautious have not yet agreed to send planes to bomb Berlin. In fact, it is just a verbal battle between Wells and the German propagandist.

Science

### The Foresight of Inventors

— Mo Ming

Since ancient times, the great contributions of many scientists and inventors have promoted human civilization and led to a more fulfilling and meaningful life. However, on the other hand, they have also "helped the wicked" and fostered the development of humanity's worst traits, making the world more tragic and restless. Is it a merit or a crime? Is it a blessing or a curse? It is not easy to distinguish clearly. However, inventors are not without foresight, and they have long considered this point! The inventor of the airship, Francesco Lana, in 1670, had already anticipated that his invention would bring disaster to future generations. Although his invention was successful, he considered it most regrettable that he had created a tool for unscrupulous people to commit inhumane and irrational atrocities.

Leonardo da Vinci, the great Italian artist and scientist of the fifteenth century, should be considered the earliest inventor of the submarine. From his notes, we can discover why he did not make his submarine invention public: "Because humans have a deeply ingrained love of killing, they will inevitably use this method to secretly attack ships underwater, killing and plundering without restraint."

It is heartbreaking that these ancient predictions have all come true in the twentieth century. Airplanes and submarines have demonstrated the power to massacre the innocent in several wars, and now it is even worse. If these inventors knew in the afterlife, they would probably feel guilty and uneasy.

Reflections

### Not "Fate"!

— Qian Changnian

"In the past," Chinese people often liked to attribute disasters they encountered to "fate," such as losing their job being attributed to "fate," their wife running away with someone else being attributed to "fate," and even a sore on their back or a mosquito bite on their thigh being attributed to "fate." Some even believed that fate was irresistible and unavoidable, so they did not bother to investigate the causes of disasters.

Believing in fate is "not trusting oneself," and the result is burying oneself alive in fate.

The above refers to "the past," and things should be different now. However, some people still do not understand. For example, when the price of rice rises from eight yuan per dan (unit of weight) to fifty yuan, some people sigh about their "bitter fate" without deeply considering whether it is really "fate" or whether there are "more obvious" reasons. Even if it rises to one hundred yuan per dan, some people still believe it is "predestined"!

The greed of hoarders is endless. It is hoped that everyone will think of a proper way to sanction them. At the same time, it is necessary to recognize that the reason for high prices is not due to "fate"!

### Axe Handle

— Hong Fei

——A Modern Fairy Tale——

A long, long time ago, when no one dreamed of Hitler, a woodcutter went into the forest and begged the trees to let his axe have a handle.

The trees saw that this was such a small request, so they generously agreed and decided that the simple and unadorned poplar tree would provide the woodcutter with an axe handle. The woodcutter fitted the axe handle and immediately began to chop and cut down all the large trees in the forest.

The oak tree saw that things were terrible and knew it was too late for regret. It whispered to the cedar tree, "I never imagined that the first concession would lead to our mutual destruction. If we had not been generous with others and sacrificed our lowly neighbors, then we might have been able to survive forever."

Entertainment World

### Kunming's Cinemas Use Local Dialect to Translate Western Films' Main Points; New-Style Cinema Has Been Completed

— Tai Long

Kunming is now the most prosperous area in the southwest, and various entertainment venues are flourishing. The film industry is also gradually developing, and the cinemas have excellent box office sales. It is also rumored that "China Film Studio," originally in Chongqing, may move to Yunnan.

Kunming originally had only two cinemas, Yile and Dazhong. The films shown were mostly Western films, with very few domestic films. However, the Western films were quite old, like those shown in the Sanlun Cinemas in Shanghai.

Recently, a new-style cinema, the "Nanping" Grand Theatre, has been completed. Its architecture, both exterior and interior, is extremely luxurious and the facilities are perfect, comparable to the top-tier cinemas in Shanghai. During the holidays, each cinema is full. Therefore, some people pre-purchase tickets and then raise the price before the screening to sell them to others. There are children at the ticket office who specialize in buying tickets for customers, taking a small fee. At the start of the screening, the Chinese national anthem is played on the loudspeaker, and the audience stands up to pay respects when photos of Sun Yat-sen, Chairman Lin Sen, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, and Provincial Chairman Long Yun are displayed on the screen. There are dozens of advertising slides, which are said to be due to the low cost. The slides are changed very quickly, and then the feature film begins. In order to make the plot clear to the audience who do not understand English, the cinema has a translator on the balcony who loudly translates the main points of the dialogue in the film into the Yunnan dialect. However, there are not many local viewers in the province now, so whether the foreign viewers who do not understand English but also do not understand the Yunnan dialect can thoroughly understand the dialogue in the film is still questionable.

### New Lineup of Shanghai Storytelling Venues

— Yu Xiu

The Lunar New Year is the season for each storytelling venue to adjust its lineup, so for the "New Year lineup," each venue has a new lineup. However, in Shanghai storytelling venues, under the situation of being monopolized by "Da Xiang Dang," although it is said to be adjusting the lineup, it is ultimately the same old tune, with the same faces that have been seen to death. Moreover, the number of storytelling venues is limited, and there is a surplus of talent, so even "Da Xiang Dang" inevitably has the risk of being left out. Now, Jiang Zhu and Xia Hesheng cannot get a spot, which is one example.

During the daytime, the strength of Dongfang is the most powerful. Zhu Zhao, Shen Xue, and Yang's lineup are all authorities in storytelling. Even Wu Jun'an and Xu Jixiang each have the power to attract an audience. Tang Feng's "Guobao Lu," although relatively inferior, is well-suited and popular in Dongfang, so it has been renewed. The next one is Lake. In the daytime small storytelling, in addition to Zhu Zhao, there are Yan Xueting and Zhou Jiang's lineup. Zhang Hongsheng's "Yinglie" is also very popular. The nighttime is the world of Qing Yueshe, but only Huang Yi'an's lineup is barely satisfactory.

Ya Lu's daytime lineup is inferior. Although Chen Ruilin is performing the new story "Nine Silk Threads," it rarely attracts an audience. Even Cao Ren'an's "Wu Yue Chunqiu" and Tang Kangbo's "Shuibo Liangshan" are making people sick of listening. In addition to Zhou Jiang, Zhu Zhao, and Zhang Hongsheng, the nighttime lineup includes Gu Hongbo's "Civet Cat Exchanging Prince," which is also popular everywhere. In fact, Gu's strength lies only in his quickness. In terms of storytelling skills, support, and roles, he is still far behind his teacher Yang Lianqing. Li Zhongkang of Nanyuan Daytime, the younger brother of storytelling king Li Bokang, has the style of his brother in his storytelling. Unfortunately, his energy is insufficient, and his throat is sandy, but the charm is still very elegant and moving.

Huiquanlou is the oldest storytelling venue, but this year it lacks special brilliance. However, the fact that it has chosen to use two new talents is a good thing. One lineup is Pang Xueting and Xie Hanting in the daytime, performing "Luo Jin Shan." They are disciples of Jiang Ruting, so their storytelling is similar to their teacher. The pipa is particularly well played. The other lineup is Yan Xiaoxiang's "Western Han" in the nighttime. I have not had the opportunity to hear his art, so I dare not comment rashly. The early morning storytelling is still Cao Ren'an's "Lie You." In addition, Longquan and Fuchun are evenly matched, with each having its own strengths and weaknesses. As for the female storytelling of Puyushe, due to limited manpower, there is no way to develop, so it is still confined to a corner of the Nanjing storytelling venue. Since Xie Xiaotian's marriage, the power to attract an audience for the three-day lineup has also been greatly reduced. Therefore, unless Puyushe can have strong reinforcements, it will be difficult to reverse this decline in a short time.

### A Record of the Six-Year-Old Prodigy Shu Duoyun's Escort

— Cao Cao

The two amateur opera troupes, Haishang and Gubo, performed enthusiastically during the Lunar New Year, with each amateur showing their best works to entertain the audience. More than twenty operas were performed in total. I wanted to comment on them one by one, but due to limited space, it was impossible. However, the most eye-catching was Miss Shu Duoyun, the daughter of Mr. Shu Sheyu (now a second-grade student at Jian Shu Elementary School). At only six years old, her performance of "Su San Escorted" was surprisingly experienced. Her gestures and expressions were in harmony with the锣鼓 (percussion instruments) , and she was calm, unhurried, and not pretentious. Her singing was stable, and her rhythm was accurate. That day, famous young actor Yu Zhenfei also stood on the stage, applauding non-stop throughout the performance. He especially praised her expression of pursing her lips when she threw down her cane at the line "There are no good people in Hongdong County." This opera was personally taught by Mrs. Osen, and it is true that a famous teacher produces a brilliant student. The costumes are also excellent.

### "China Film News"

— Traveling Reporter

Launching on March 15th

There will be a huge publication appearing in this year's publishing world, which is the weekly "China Film News" dedicated to Chinese film news. Due to the success of "Asian Film News," the Chinese film industry has encountered some difficulties, that is, the success of Western film promotion and audiences. For this reason, and not only to promote film culture, several people enthusiastic about domestic films decided to found a weekly "China Film News," which is scheduled to be published on March 15th.

As far as I know, they have sufficient capital, and they are maintained by advertising under the organization of a limited company. They are printed on glossy paper, eight open pages, the same as "Asian Film News," with equal emphasis on pictures and text, with specially invited experts writing articles, and various film companies and theaters also helping to sponsor.

For the large-scale plan, the selling price is temporarily set at five cents per copy, and the annual subscription price is two yuan including postage, and each issue has movie tickets and movie star photos as prizes to encourage the interest of subscribers. This is of course also news that movie fans are happy to know, right?

### Listening to Huangjin Erjinkong (Part 1)

— Su Shaoqing

Xi Xiaobo ascended to the stage of Huangjin on the first day of the Lunar New Year of Gengchen, jumping from second-tier old male role to first-tier. This is a happy event. I should have rushed to listen to the wonderful performance some days ago, but for half a month, it was difficult to buy tickets, and I missed listening to "Empty City Stratagem" and "Bumping Monument." Until the 21st, "Erjinkong" was performed, and I was invited by a singing friend, Mr. Zhang, who had reserved seats. I first watched "Su Huantao Bai Shan Dao Jun." Gao Shenglin played Tianba, imitating Yang Xiaolou in singing, acting, and recitation, with a concise and clear representation. There were several bursts of laughter. Further study is needed. He is young now, and in the future, he can be expected to achieve great things. Qiu Shengrong played Dou Erdun. I did not see the horse theft scene before. There was too much nasal sound in the "Bai Shan" singing. The acting and dialogue were sometimes overdone and sometimes too restrained, probably to save energy to sing "Erjinkong." I think Qiu should learn from his father, Qiu Guixian, and not from Jin Shaoshan. Li Kechang's replacement in the "Hook Theft" scene was quite competent. His singing imitating Huang San was also quite tasteful.

"Erjinkong" began, and Hou Yulan, playing Li Yanfei, came on stage, singing a segment of the "Ehuang Zhengban," which was old-fashioned and fairly stable. Xi Xiaobo sang a segment of "Qian Sui Ye," which was perfect and flawless, but lacked excitement. His voice can handle the proper main key, with some reserve at the high notes, but slightly lacking in the wide range. In each theater, during the half-month before the Lantern Festival, with double daytime and nighttime performances, the voices of the actors were inevitably affected. Even the best voices would be 10% off, and their spirits were like those of soldiers who had fought for a long time, with their courage exhausted. Therefore, veteran opera fans who are particular about the details of the performance rarely enter the theater before the Lantern Festival. That Xi and the other three still have this achievement can be considered a remarkable talent.
