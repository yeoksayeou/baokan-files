### U.S. Building Far East Patrol Fleet; Preparing to Take Extraordinary Action; Knox Says U.S. Will Continue to Aid China and Britain; Requisitioning Merchant Ships to Transport Troops and Increase Defense of Hawaii

New York – Secretary of the Navy Knox declared today that Americans will continue to aid Britain and China, and that Americans will accumulate weapons and will not appease anyone. (Reuters, 13th)

Washington – The United States Navy is now urgently preparing everything in the Pacific Ocean to be able to take action in times of emergency. Coincidentally, the authorities recently announced that two powerful U.S. Navy fleets will be established in the Far East, with the principle of being able to operate independently in that area. The Navy Department announced last night that it has requisitioned five merchant ships from the Panama Pacific Line, each with a displacement of 8,378 tons. It is widely believed that these ships will be assigned as transport vessels to carry reinforcements to Hawaii, and will later be converted into aircraft carriers. The government has also requisitioned the giant ship "President Roosevelt," with a displacement of 13,869 tons. The ship’s route from New York to Bermuda will be immediately suspended. According to officials in Washington, the government may purchase the "President Roosevelt," but this matter is still in progress and has not reached a final decision. Officials also refused to announce the Navy Department's intentions for the "President Roosevelt," but it is widely believed that the ship will be sent to the Pacific. The government's requisition of additional auxiliary ships coincides with the urgent reinforcement of troops in Hawaii. According to reliable sources in naval circles, the authorities may reorganize the country's fleet in the Pacific and establish two large fleets in the Far East capable of fighting independently. It is also understood that this plan has been under consideration by the authorities here for several months. It is believed that this plan will be expedited due to Japan's joining the German-Italian axis. It is said that although this plan will not be implemented until the garrison in Hawaii has been fully strengthened, the time for its implementation is not far off. It is said that this plan is intended to establish another Asian fleet in the southern part of the Far East, in opposition to the patrol fleets of the Yangtze River and North China. It is understood that this southern fleet will be equipped with all patrol military equipment, using Manila as its base, for reconnaissance and patrol purposes. It is also believed that the Singapore naval base may also be adopted at any time. (United Press, 23rd)

### U.S. to Obtain More Bases in the Pacific; Powerful Army Actively Under Construction

New York – The New York Tribune Assembly Hall opened today. Secretary of the Navy Knox attended the opening ceremony and delivered a speech, stating that in the near future, the United States will obtain more naval bases in the Pacific. When discussing the progress of the United States' rearmament, he said that the United States needs more naval bases in the Pacific, and said, "The United States will obtain these bases." He also said that the location of the bases in the Pacific will depend on the evolution of the situation. At present, the United States has the most powerful fleet, its speed, armament, combat effectiveness, and form are unmatched. Once an order is received, the entire fleet can be deployed to various key points to control sea routes. However, this defense strategy may not be strong enough. The United States has waited too long to strengthen its navy. The United States did not recognize early enough how important the navy is to the security of the United States. There is no excuse for this. Now, because the United States may have to fight the totalitarian countries alone, the United States has been awakened." He also said that the speed of shipbuilding has exceeded the planned schedule. Undersecretary of the Army Patterson also attended the ceremony. He warned the American people that the United States is not yet able to defend its country on land, and that it will take a year and a half before the United States can enter the battlefield with "an army sufficient to deal with any provocation." He continued, "The world situation is very critical. I have never shaken my command. It must be known that the question is not whether the United States will participate in the war. Many countries overseas that did not want the war to come have already been plunged into war. Therefore, the war may extend to the United States." (International Telegraph, 23rd)

New York – Undersecretary of the Army Petersen yesterday warned the American people not to be impatient with the progress of armaments, and said that the military equipment that can be delivered and used next March may not be much more than today, but by next September, the situation will be much better.

By March 1942, we should be able to cope with any challenge. (Reuters, 23rd)

### Mexico Decides to Prohibit Scrap Iron Exports to Japan; Cancels Gasoline Contract with Japan; Hull Pays Attention to This Move

Newspaper Threatens Dutch East Indies; Actually Advocates Use of Force

Tokyo – Japanese newspapers today warned the Dutch East Indies that unless the Dutch East Indies authorities accept Japan's economic demands, Japan may take military action to achieve its goals. The Asahi Shimbun, the most influential newspaper here, said that in order to make the East Indies join the Japanese side, "We should choose one of the following two paths: either clearly declare to them that relying on the United States is useless, or simply use force to make them submit." The newspaper severely attacked the Dutch East Indies' "traditional policy of relying on Britain and the United States." It is said that Japan recalled Chief Kobayashi of the delegation to listen to his detailed report. The newspaper also said that normally, Kobayashi should not have been summoned back before completing his mission. Therefore, his sudden return to Japan indicates that Japan's basic policy towards the Dutch East Indies has changed. The Asahi Shimbun and Yomiuri Shimbun commented on this matter, saying that Britain's "monopoly" in the Dutch East Indies is another clear evidence of Britain's repeated undermining of U.S.-Japan relations. The Yomiuri Shimbun said, "Britain's recent series of unfriendly actions towards Japan, such as reopening the Burma Road and arresting Japanese residents in Singapore, have deeply angered Japanese officials and non-officials." The newspaper continued, "It is inevitable that Japan should adopt a stronger line against Britain." The Yomiuri Shimbun also said that although the gasoline negotiations currently being held between Japan and the Dutch East Indies authorities are "very smooth," Japan must still pay attention to the sabotage of Britain and the United States. (United Press, 23rd)

Tokyo – Suma, a spokesman for the Japanese Foreign Ministry, today denied that Japan had reached a gasoline agreement with the Dutch East Indies. Suma said that the government's recall of Kobayashi, the chief of the delegation to the Dutch East Indies, was unrelated to the negotiations in Batavia. Suma also refused to comment on Japanese newspaper reports that Britain and the United States were currently placing "various obstacles" in the way of the Batavia negotiations. (United Press, 23rd)

British Ships Dutch East Indies Oil; Sufficient to Embarrass Japan

Washington – Experts here now believe that Britain's large-scale purchase of oil from the Dutch East Indies may put Japan's war in China in a difficult position. Japan, in view of the U.S. restrictions on the export of certain oils, will have a special feeling about Britain's purchase of oil. According to expert estimates, Japan consumed nearly 25.5 million barrels of various gasoline and kerosene last year. Experts believe that although there is no reliable information about Japan's indirect acquisition of oil from various places, it is believed that a large amount of oil transported from the Dutch East Indies to Singapore, Malacca, and some small islands near the Straits Settlements must have been transshipped to Japan. These islands were the largest importers of oil produced by the Dutch East Indies last year, amounting to nearly one million barrels. In the first nine months of last year, Japan directly purchased 1,336,000 barrels of oil from the Dutch East Indies. (United Press, 23rd)

### Admiral Yarnell Advocates Aiding Chinese Industry; Writes to American Celebrities Urging Them to Donate Funds; A Strong China is Extremely Important to the U.S.

Washington – Former Commander-in-Chief of the Asian Fleet, Admiral Yarnell, yesterday wrote to American celebrities, urging them to donate funds to aid China's industrial cooperatives. Admiral Yarnell himself is the chairman of the American Industrial Aid to China Committee. The admiral said in his letter, "The act of aiding Chinese industry is the best way to show that Americans strongly support the courage of the Chinese people. This not only helps the Chinese people build industry, but also indirectly helps them fight the war." The cooperative system adopted in the interior of China has established countless factories in coastal towns. The letter also said, "The Chinese people are using their own strength to improve crude tools with the raw materials and crafts that can be obtained, and expanding China's new industry, which is to build a stronger China, which is extremely important to the American people."

Editorial

### The Brewing of the Japanese Cabinet Reorganization

Yesterday's Tokyo news from Reuters and United Press; The Japanese Kokumin Shimbun stated on the 22nd that because Britain and the United States are cooperating in the Pacific to deal with the Tripartite Pact, it is necessary to reorganize the Japanese cabinet. Konoe will transfer several cabinet members in early November to form a strong wartime cabinet. Kokumin Shimbun is the mouthpiece of the military. Now it is the first to reveal the saying of reorganizing the cabinet, which should be regarded as reflecting the military's proposition. Originally, the establishment of the current Konoe Cabinet was based on the military's operation; and the military's foreign policy was also fully supported by Konoe; now, after only three months, the military has issued the call for reorganization again, which is of course due to the various internal and external difficulties in Japan at present, and at the same time, it can be seen that the historical chronic disease of political instability in Japan has not been improved by Konoe's reform movement.

According to Kokumin Shimbun, the purpose of reorganizing the government is to form a strong wartime cabinet to cope with the tense situation in the Pacific, which shows that in the eyes of the military, the current cabinet is not strong enough. Analyzing the essence of the Konoe Cabinet, it is a mixture of military cliques, bureaucrats, and a small part of the financial clique, and recently added three political party figures for decoration; judging from its lineup, it is quite weak, but this is precisely to adapt to the military's requirements; because only in this way is it convenient for the military to boss around. Therefore, the so-called strengthening the cabinet at this time, its original intention is definitely not like Konoe's reorganization of the cabinet in May 1938, citing giants such as Ikeda and Ugaki; on the other hand, the military's intention is not necessarily focused on those cabinet members who came from bureaucrats or political parties, because they cannot form a major obstacle to the military's attempts. Moreover, the principle of the Tripartite Pact should have been determined at the beginning of Konoe's cabinet formation, and was not a temporary motion after Stahmer arrived in Tokyo; then the so-called situation caused by the Tripartite Pact should have been considered in the process of cabinet formation, and it will not wait until today to form a problem. Comprehensive observations from all aspects show that if there is a crack in the Japanese government this time, this crack does not exist in the branches and leaves, but in its trunk, and what is debated is not general political views but the difference in the concept of basic national policy.

Konoe's New Order Movement was originally a reform to promote Japan's national unity, but in the early stage of the movement, the contradiction between Konoe and the military was exposed; Konoe flaunted his view of unifying the supreme command of legislation and politics, which was obviously not supported by the military. Around the time when the cadre candidates of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association were decided, the military's mouthpiece newspaper's attack on Konoe's conservative compromise tendency reached a fever pitch, but Konoe did not pay much attention to this, so in the selection of the directors of the Assistance Association and the supplement of the ministers of the three provinces of Takushoku, he made the decision regardless of the military's opposition, and thus the crack between them became more profound. After the conclusion of the Tripartite Pact, the attitude of Britain and the United States suddenly turned strong, and Japan did not receive the benefit of the alliance, but instead encountered unprecedented major difficulties; this situation undoubtedly further affected the differences in opinions within Japan; the military and right-wing elements clamored sharply, while the conservative class was apprehensive, and although Konoe and Matsuoka personally signed the alliance, their attitudes were not entirely consistent with the military. Even Matsuoka, who was known for being pro-military and right-leaning, his statements in the past half month were obviously different from the public opinion reflecting the military's views in recent times; his diplomatic operations and the reshuffle of the diplomatic corps, as well as the statements made by the spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Suma, and the recent ambassador to Chile, Ishii, were all inseparable from the consistent old habits of Kasumigaseki diplomacy, and the words were very different from the innovative diplomacy advocated by Shiro Tori and Hiroshi Oshima. Of course, these can all be regarded as external postures, not real softening, and there is no essential difference between Konoe, Matsuoka and the military and extreme elements; but they have more compromising elements in their aggressive internal and external policies, and from time to time reflect the views of the so-called conservative camp; this situation cannot be tolerated by the military for a long time.

In the past half month, the military has not directly criticized the moderate face of the current cabinet's foreign policy, which is not a tacit understanding, but an expectation of the success of the ongoing economic negotiations with French Indochina and the Dutch East Indies; those negotiations are not enough to offset the huge pressure from Britain and the United States, but are the only things that the Japanese side can take comfort in at present, along with the negotiations with the Soviet Union. If these negotiations cannot have any definite gains, Japan must reconsider its internal and external policies and make a final choice between thorough adventure and a change of course. Thus, it can be seen that the reason why the so-called recall of Kobayashi from the Dutch East Indies is related to the change of the cabinet. Recently, the progress of the Japanese negotiations with the Dutch East Indies has not been very smooth, which has invisibly increased the political instability in Japan.

Kokumin Shimbun once warned the Japanese people: "The situation in the Far East is gradually becoming serious. In order to achieve the goal and maintain dignity, we should make full preparations so that we can choose one of the two paths of fighting or making peace with Britain"; from the military's point of view, what it chooses will be nothing more than expanding the war, but this is not necessarily the common view of the vast majority of Japanese people. If the above analysis is not far from the facts, then the military's advocacy of reorganizing the cabinet is mainly to liquidate the conservative and compromising trends in the policies of Konoe and Matsuoka, and to make Japan form a political organization that is more suitable for foreign war; it is not possible to predict at present how this prospect will evolve, but it is not difficult to see Japan's future trends by observing whether Konoe will eventually comply with the military's request and reorganize the cabinet, and how to reorganize it.

### Changes in Leadership at Ta Kung Pao: A Diplomatic Lineup

Chongqing: Today's Ta Kung Pao carried an editorial advocating for changes in China's diplomatic lineup, proposing: (1) the complete abolishment of embassies in all Nordic countries, including those in Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, and Belgium; (2) the abolishment of embassies in Cuba and Panama, with their duties to be concurrently managed by the embassy in Mexico, and the abolishment of embassies in Peru and Chile, with their duties concurrently managed by the embassy in Brazil; (3) the funds saved should be used to establish new embassies in Australia and Central Asia; (4) the appointment of roving ambassadors without fixed posts. The newspaper also advocated for abolishing the embassy in Vichy and replacing it with a minister, as well as abolishing the commission to the League of Nations. It suggested appointing Wellington Koo as a roving ambassador to oversee China's interests in Europe. Regarding Siam and the Nanyang region, it proposed establishing a roving minister, and the same for Egypt, Africa, and the Near East. Foreign diplomatic representatives should be summoned back to the country periodically to gain insight into the recent situation of the nation. Furthermore, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs itself should be reorganized to strengthen the intelligence department. (Reuters, 23rd)

Chongqing: Today's Ta Kung Pao published an article strongly advocating for the reorganization of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the adjustment of diplomatic envoys, and the enhancement of diplomatic effectiveness. In the strongly worded article, the newspaper forcefully argued that the "alarming" expenses of foreign embassies should be abolished. It stated that the European War had caused many changes and that many foreign embassies were no longer needed. Therefore, the dispatch of representatives in the future should be determined by the current situation in order to adapt to the Pacific region, which requires more attention from China. As for Germany, it has now formed the Tripartite Pact, which is tantamount to abandoning China and befriending Japan, assisting its invasion of China. Therefore, the German issue should also be given serious consideration. The newspaper further questioned the necessity of China dispatching an ambassador to Germany and advocated for reducing the staff of the embassy in France, with the current ambassador to France, the highly skilled diplomat Dr. Wellington Koo, concurrently serving as ambassador to various European countries. The newspaper also advocated for recalling envoys to countries occupied by Germany, such as Poland and Norway. As for the newspaper's advocacy for the internal reorganization of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, its main reason was that personnel in the General Affairs Department and the Intelligence Department were ineffective and emphasized personal relationships rather than talent.

### France to Grant Customs Autonomy to the Vietnamese Government to Allow Japanese Goods to Enjoy Preferential Import Tariffs

Clermont-Ferrand: The famous political commentator Gana Vallejo recently published an article in "Paris Soir" stating that the government will soon grant customs autonomy to Vietnam to freely adjust its business relations with Japan. The French delegation will go to Tokyo in a short period of time, and at least two important officials will be among them. The Japanese economic delegation has already arrived in Hanoi and will collect various information to prepare for the negotiation of economic agreements and immediately establish a purchase method with the Vietnamese authorities to purchase rice and rubber. They will also determine the supply methods for the Japanese troops stationed in Tonkin. France also hopes that Vietnam can reach an agreement with Japan, so it has decided to grant customs autonomy to Vietnam so that it can grant preferential import tariffs to certain Japanese goods under substantial exchange conditions. Considering the economic position of Vietnam, it should agree. On the other hand, if Vietnam still belongs to the same customs group as France, then the French headquarters must also reduce tariffs on Japanese goods. If so, Japanese goods will inevitably flood the French market, which is not beneficial to the French economy. (Havas, 22nd)

### Rice Shortage in Hankou Becomes Increasingly Severe

Hankou: The rice shortage in Hankou is becoming increasingly severe. If the current situation does not change drastically this winter or no one organizes disaster relief, it is feared that there will be widespread starvation. It is heard that in rice-producing areas, the price of rice is only 10 yuan per dan, which is the price at which the Japanese army purchases it. Although the price of rice here is reported to be 40 yuan per shi, it can only be purchased for 60 yuan. The high price of rice is reportedly due to heavy taxes along the way and the fact that rice merchants must pay a large fee to obtain a pass to transport rice here. Another reason is hoarding by the rich and manipulation by unscrupulous merchants. (Reuters, 23rd)

### Nazi Oppression of France, Participation in the Anti-British War: Hitler Receives Laval in France, Contents of Talks Refused to be Disclosed

Berlin: According to official sources here last night, German Führer Hitler yesterday met with French Deputy Prime Minister Laval in a certain occupied area of France. The news of the meeting between Hitler and Laval, along with rumors that France might declare war on Britain, spread simultaneously (this rumor has been denied by the Vichy side). It is also said that German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop was also present at the meeting between Hitler and Laval. (United Press dispatch, 23rd)

Vichy: Regarding the meeting between Deputy Premier Laval and German Führer Hitler, responsible officials here refused to disclose the content of the talks, only saying that it concerned the future of France and was the most important event since the establishment of the armistice agreement between France and Germany. (Havas dispatch, 23rd)

Berlin: According to the German News Agency, French Deputy Prime Minister Laval has traveled from Paris to Vichy. Upon arrival today, he immediately reported to General Pétain. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)

Berlin: The German official news agency declared that political figures here have not made any comments on the nature of the meeting between Hitler and French Deputy Prime Minister Laval. German newspapers only published this fact with large headlines. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)

New York: According to Berlin news reported by various newspapers here, it is implied that Hitler is now attempting to gather the remaining French warships with the German and Italian fleets for a final battle against the British fleet. Several radio commentators have strongly stated that Hitler is most concerned about the willingness of the French fleet to cooperate. Suggestions regarding this matter occupied an important part of the discussions between Hitler and French Deputy Prime Minister Laval. Most commentators believe that France joining the German side in the war is unlikely, and they emphasize that the French people are unwilling and are different from their government. Many believe that British Prime Minister Churchill's broadcast to France anticipated the meeting between Hitler and Laval and recognize this as proof of Britain's well-informed sources in Europe. (Reuters dispatch, 25th)

Berlin: Because Hitler, Ribbentrop, and French Deputy Prime Minister Laval held a sensational secret meeting in Paris, political observers here today suggested that as a result of the meeting, France might join the Axis powers in the war against Britain. It is also expected that Belgium and the Netherlands will immediately obtain the opportunity to unite with Germany and Italy, so that they can receive more lenient peace terms along with France when the European war ends in the future. People in Berlin firmly believe that the state of war between Germany and France can be said to have ended due to recent diplomatic negotiations between the two countries. Many believe that the French government will soon move back to Paris from Vichy. (International News Service dispatch, 23rd)

Berlin: Today, it was officially declared here that the meeting between German Führer Hitler, German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, and French Deputy Prime Minister Laval has been held in "a certain place in France." Many believe that the purpose of the meeting is to create closer cooperation between France and the Axis powers in the European war. It is reported that France will be given lenient peace terms, and if France can assist in defeating Britain, it may also be able to share a portion of the spoils of the British Empire. The official announcement did not mention holding a meeting in Vichy, which is generally regarded as extremely important. News circulated this morning that Marshal Pétain had refused the demand for France to share its fate with the Axis powers. If that is the case, many believe that Hitler may form a new French government under Laval. Many believe that ending the existing formal war between France and Germany is also one of the initial proposals of the meeting. If France is willing to assist the Axis powers, it is believed that Hitler may immediately approve a peaceful resolution, and France may therefore retain its pre-war territory within the country and throughout its entire empire, with the exception of Alsace-Lorraine and Savoy, as well as former German colonies before Djibouti. Informed sources say that if Britain is defeated, a portion of the British Empire, promising a portion of North Africa, may be granted to France as compensation. (International News Service dispatch, 23rd)

France Needs Peace, Eager to Cooperate with Germany

New York: A "New York Times" correspondent stationed in Vichy claimed that French Foreign Minister Baudouin, when receiving American newspaper reporters, strongly emphasized the need for peace and allowed cooperation between France and Germany. He said that if France is prepared to cooperate with continental Europe, it is because France has been invaded three times in the last century and has suffered greatly in each war because it did not eagerly seek a just peace. We in the new French regime will provide unlimited assistance to the genuine organization of Europe. France intends to cooperate with all countries in this spirit to prepare for the reconstruction of its own economy. Baudouin also said that the new restrictions on Jews are a security measure and have no racial significance. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)

Vichy Government Denies Preparing to Declare War on Britain

Vichy: Last night, the French government denied rumors that France was preparing to declare war on Britain. According to an official spokesperson, "The French government officially denies overseas rumors that Deputy Prime Minister Laval has negotiated a French declaration of war on Britain in Paris. The spokesperson said that this rumor is absurd, because Laval went to Paris yesterday to meet with Führer Hitler only to discuss general issues related to French-German relations." Subsequently, French Foreign Minister Baudouin also denied that France would fight any country. He said that France is only seeking peace and is willing to cooperate with Germany to rebuild Europe. He also said that the post-war disposition of Alsace-Lorraine will be extremely important in French-German relations. According to well-informed sources here, Laval has brought a draft of an extension to the French-German armistice agreement, which expires on September 25, to Paris. It is also said that Laval is seeking to obtain the French government's approval to return to Paris, but it is heard that the terms proposed by Germany for allowing this request have not been accepted by the Vichy government. (United Press dispatch, 23rd)

Harsh Peace Terms, Pétain Resolutely Rejects

Washington: Last night, diplomatic circles here declared that Germany, two weeks ago, submitted a final peace proposal to the Vichy government on the condition that France participate in the anti-British war. It is said that Marshal Pétain and most cabinet members advocated rejecting the peace treaty, but Deputy Prime Minister Laval supported acceptance. Laval is currently visiting Paris to make efforts to accept the peace treaty. It is rumored that the terms proposed by Germany include the following: (1) France allows participation in the Axis powers to establish a new European order, but only participates as an allied country of the Axis powers. (2) Cede Alsace-Lorraine to Germany, and cede Nice to Italy. (3) The French naval, land, and air forces stationed in Africa participate in the Axis attack on Egypt and Palestine. (4) Germany and Italy take over French naval and air bases in the Mediterranean and Africa. (5) Redistribute French colonies. France can still possess Algeria, but must share French Morocco with Italy and return former German colonies. (6) Other French colonies will be jointly managed by Germany, Italy, and France. According to diplomatic circles, the peace treaty has caused heated debate in the Vichy cabinet. Foreign Minister Baudouin supports Laval's suggestion to accept the peace treaty. Laval believes that Germany's proposal of a peace treaty to France shows that Germany is extremely willing to quickly end the war for the "interests of Europe." Marshal Pétain disagrees with Laval's proposal. It is said that he will never sign this peace treaty with Germany. Defense Minister Weygand supports Pétain's proposal. All other cabinet members, except Navy Minister Darlan, support Marshal Pétain. It is heard that the French minister's opposition to Laval's plan is due to the fear that once the peace treaty proposed by Germany is accepted, the French colonies will be separated from the Vichy government and thrown into the arms of the Free French leader, de Gaulle. It is also heard that this peace treaty was proposed to France immediately after Hitler and Prime Minister Mussolini met at the Brenner Pass. (United Press dispatch, 23rd)

Zurich: According to the "Völkischer Beobachter," Axis powers recently proposed the following conditions to the Vichy government: (1) France will cede Alsace and Lorraine to Germany, and cede Nice to Italy. (2) Tunis will be divided between France and Italy, and Algiers will remain French. (3) France will cede northern Morocco to Spain. (4) The remaining French African colonies will be jointly ruled and developed by France, Germany, and Italy. (5) France will cede Vietnam to Japan. (6) France will hand over its Mediterranean fleet and the air force stationed in North Africa to the Axis powers for deployment for the purpose of attacking Britain. (7) If the above conditions are accepted by France, Germany will withdraw most of the occupied areas of France, with the exception of the Straits ports and the so-called blockade zone from the southwestern border through Burgundy to the Belgian border and the Saône River. The newspaper also said that after the above conditions were submitted to a special meeting of the Vichy government for review, they were rejected by the majority. General Pétain, General Weygand, and several other cabinet members spoke out against acceptance, while Deputy Prime Minister Laval, Foreign Minister Baudouin, and Navy Minister Darlan supported acceptance. Since the above request was rejected, Laval has gone to Paris again and is still continuing negotiations. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)

The Hearts of the French People Have Not Died, Deeply Fearing Revolution

This morning's "Daily Express" in London published a message from Geneva stating that French leader Marshal Pétain fears that if he joins Hitler in fighting against Britain, a revolution will break out in France. The message also stated, "The Vichy government has issued a statement saying that France does not intend to fight anyone, only to resist aggression." The "Daily Express" commented, "Rumors that Marshal Pétain will declare war on Britain can be refuted without attacking them." Many believe that if Pétain joins Hitler, Pétain fears that a revolution will break out in France, and large-scale obstructive organizations have already been secretly established in France.

### Germany to Use Spanish Islands as Bases for Attacking Britain, Important Diplomatic Developments in the Next Forty-Eight Hours

Berlin: German sources declared here yesterday that there will be important diplomatic developments between Spain and the Axis countries within these forty-eight hours. This news coincides with the news from neutral countries that German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop has gone to Madrid. A Nazi source claimed that Spain may take a position sympathetic to the Axis countries, and Spain may allow the Axis countries to use the Canary Islands and Madeira as submarine bases for the war against Britain, while also allowing Axis troops to pass through Spain and attack Gibraltar by land.

### Britain Actively Engaged in Diplomacy in the Balkans, Axis Powers Observe Eden's Whereabouts, Moscow Authorities Watch Developments Calmly

Ankara: British Ambassador to Turkey, Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, and Minister to Yugoslavia, Campbell, will arrive here together today. Diplomatic circles in the Turkish capital believe that this is a symbol of Britain's attempt to form a battle line in the Near East. Whether it will succeed depends on the attitude of Turkey. (Haitong dispatch, 23rd)

Sofia: According to a report by Haitong News Agency's special correspondent, Baron Sassmann, regarding British diplomatic activities in Turkey and Greece, and British Secretary of War Eden's tour of Egypt and Palestine, all circles in Bulgaria are paying close attention. Since Romania established a new order, the hope of Britain causing disputes in that country has been dashed. There is now evidence that British propaganda agencies have chosen Sofia as the center of their Balkan propaganda activities. Recent startling news published in newspapers, such as the conflict between German and Soviet troops on the Romanian border, the entry of German troops into Bulgaria, and the construction of pontoon bridges by German troops on the Danube, were all issued from Sofia. Although the Bulgarian people pay great attention to this news, they all know that it is British propaganda, because there is no doubt that the Bulgarian people are now leaning towards the Axis powers. The Soviet Union will not interfere in the Balkans, and Turkey is also skeptical of the Soviet Union. As for the Soviet Union's policy, it is based entirely on national interests, so there will be no changes. (Haitong dispatch, 23rd)

Stockholm: According to news from London, semi-official sources in London admitted last night that British Secretary of War Eden will travel from Cairo to Istanbul. (Haitong dispatch, 23rd)

The arrival of British Minister to Yugoslavia, Campbell, in Istanbul seems to confirm this statement. Regarding Eden's second step, Cairo has not published any official reports, but well-informed sources say that Eden is likely to go to Ankara and Jeddah, but given the recent fierce anti-British movement in Jeddah, Eden will not go there. It is expected that Eden will not visit Greece either. (Haitong dispatch, 23rd)

### Greek-Turkish Alliance Denied by Greek Side

Athens: Officials here yesterday solemnly denied rumors circulating outside that Greece and Turkey have established a military alliance. Political figures here pointed out that since Turkey signed an agreement with Western countries, the close relationship and feelings between Greece and Turkey have gradually become indifferent. Furthermore, Greece had the intention of establishing a close relationship with Turkey in August, but Turkey expressed a negative attitude. The Greek-Turkish Friendship Treaty of 1929 has not been supplemented by any other agreements to date, except for the signing of a military agreement in 1939. (Haitong dispatch, 23rd)

### London's Air Defenses Are Strong, German Attacks Have Failed, Heavy Bombing in the Midlands, British Aircraft Successfully Raid German Docks at Night

London: This morning, German bombers changed course to the Midlands. The main offensive seems to have abandoned its attempt to break London's will with night raids. The British military believes that this change in German air strategy is a victory for British fighter jets and anti-aircraft guns. Since Hitler launched his "total air war" forty-seven days ago, London residents had their first few moments of rest last night. Last night and this morning, London's air raid sirens sounded twice. The first time was just after nightfall, as usual. The alert was lifted near midnight, at which time the German planes had already bid farewell to London after dropping a few bombs on suburban residences. The second alert was issued shortly after midnight, but it was lifted at 1:30 this morning. During both air raids, German planes did not reach the center of London. While London enjoyed an unusual silence last night, several cities in the Midlands were heavily bombed by German planes. It is reported that several people in a certain town were buried in the air-raid shelter of a certain hotel, and in another town, a large number of incendiary bombs were dropped, causing a large fire.

According to reports received so far, although several bombs fell on a certain town on the southeast coast, the damage was minimal. A total of three enemy aircraft were shot down yesterday, and the British side also lost six fighter jets, but the pilots of two were unharmed. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)

London: The Air Ministry's intelligence office said that on Monday night, British Air Force bombers heavily attacked the Blohm+Voss shipyards in Hamburg, which are building German warships. The air raid began at 8:00 p.m. and continued for more than an hour, dropping many tons of explosives and over a thousand incendiary bombs on the shipyards, docks, and their surroundings. At that time, the ground was covered in smoke, the searchlights were active, and the anti-aircraft fire was intense. British aircrews had difficulty carrying out bombing, but British planes attacked individually from all sides, which made it possible to avoid ground defenses and drop bombs that hit the shipyards and surrounding docks in many places, causing fires and becoming a large fire pit. On the same night, at 6:30, British heavy bombers

### German Planes Use Concrete Bombs

Moscow: The local radio station said yesterday that when German planes attacked London, they were now using bombs wrapped in concrete. This type of concrete bomb has the power to penetrate the floors of ordinary houses. Germany's war expenses are huge and they have to seek substitutes. The German petroleum incendiary bomb is also a substitute. The burning material is more expensive, so petroleum is used instead. However, its firepower is weaker. (Reuters dispatch, 20th) launched a lightning-fast attack on the Reichswald oil refinery near Düsseldorf. Bombs fell like rain for ten minutes, and ten fires were seen in the target area. The Düsseldorf railway yard was bombed, and explosions and fires occurred in many places. The Düsseldorf southwest railway main line and the Stante aircraft field were also bombed. Also, yesterday afternoon, a British Air Force bomber flew to three miles off the coast of the Netherlands and spotted a heavily loaded 2,000-ton enemy merchant ship, so it dove through the clouds and dropped a batch of explosive bombs from a height of 900 feet and hit its bow.

### British and Italian Navies in Fierce Battle in the Red Sea; One Italian Destroyer Sunk; Egyptian Capital Attacked from the Air for the First Time

London – The British destroyer HMS Kimberley, which six months ago joined allied ships in the Arctic waters off Narvik, Norway, to defeat a German destroyer flotilla, has now triumphed in the sweltering heat of the Red Sea in an engagement with an Italian destroyer and shore batteries. Last night's naval communique stated that the Italian destroyer "Nullo" was forced aground and destroyed by torpedoes from the Kimberley. This is in stark contrast to reports from Rome. According to the British communique, on the night of October 20, two Italian destroyers in the Red Sea shelled a British convoy. The escort vessels immediately returned fire and gave chase, but contact was temporarily lost. The following day, at daybreak, HMS Kimberley, under the command of Lieutenant Commander Lee-chuson, re-engaged with an enemy vessel, identified as the destroyer "Nullo". In the 40-minute engagement, the Italian ship was severely damaged and ran aground near the shore. As the "Kimberley" fired torpedoes to destroy it, the "Kimberley" itself was hit by a shell from three enemy shore batteries, causing slight damage to a steam pipe and reducing speed. However, it continued to return fire, and as a result, two of the three shore batteries were destroyed and silenced. Three members of the Kimberley's crew were injured, but no other British ships or merchant vessels were damaged.

Furthermore, according to the Air Ministry, an Italian destroyer in the Red Sea was attacked by British aircraft on Sunday, with a hit on the stern. This was part of a broader operation by the British Air Force in the Middle East on Sunday. Enemy engineering teams and motor transport vehicles between Solum and Buq Buq were attacked by low-flying British aircraft. Several enemy naval vessels were bombed, either catching fire or sustaining heavy damage. In addition, the British Air Force repeatedly attacked Asmara and Gura in Eritrea. Bombs hit oil tanks near factories, and buildings caught fire. An airfield in Bahrdar, Italian East Africa, was bombed twice, with buildings hit in the area of Tessenei. A British aircraft engaged an Italian aircraft over the Red Sea, pursuing it for thirty miles, witnessing it descending with heavy smoke billowing from its fuselage. Furthermore, a South African Air Force fighter, operating near the Kenya-Abyssinia border, shot down an Italian Caproni bomber, and the crew was captured. Several enemy aircraft flew over Malta on Sunday, where they were intercepted by British aircraft and fled in panic before dropping any bombs. (Reuter, 23rd)

These have now been attacked by Italian forces. South of Helwan, the British have constructed a state-of-the-art airfield. The air raid alarm in the Egyptian capital lasted for ninety minutes. (Haitong Telegraph, 23rd)

Istanbul – The Stefani news agency issued a message yesterday stating that the British semi-official report that Italian aircraft had bombed Cairo was entirely untrue. According to the Italian military report, the target bombed by Italian aircraft was the British air force base at Helwan, south of Cairo, and not Cairo itself. (Haitong Telegraph, 23rd)

### United China Relief Fund; Fundraising Publicity Campaign; Tremendous Aid Provided to China in the Past Three Years; This Year's Rice Bowl Rally to Be Held Early Next Month

The United China Relief Fund is the largest and most powerful organization in the United States providing medical assistance to China. It announced its establishment shortly after the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, motivated by a desire to express sympathy for China and provide effective assistance. However, due to the U.S. government's neutral stance on the diplomatic front, its mode of operation was limited to medical assistance. From the perspective of the war of resistance, medical aid to China may seem to have no direct relationship to military affairs. In reality, it alleviates the suffering of the wounded and refugees, lowers the mortality rate of soldiers and civilians, and, most importantly, curbs the spread of infectious diseases. Therefore, medical aid to China, from the perspective of the overall war of resistance and the revival of China, not only indirectly provides tremendous assistance to the military but also has an immeasurable impact on the overall strength of the entire nation. The importance of the Fund's role in China's revival and war of resistance should be introduced and given special attention. (Last year, the Director of the National Health Administration broadcast from Chongqing that the cholera epidemic was extremely serious in 1938, but thanks to the assistance of the United China Relief Fund, it was much less prevalent this year. These few words testify to the Fund's contribution to our compatriots.)

For the past three years, the Fund has been constantly engaged in fundraising. It has reportedly dispatched medicines, hospital equipment, ambulances, and is currently constructing a vaccine laboratory in China (once completed, the laboratory will be able to produce vaccines domestically), totaling over one million U.S. dollars, an astonishing sum when converted to Chinese currency. The sources of the Fund's donations include direct solicitations from individuals, as well as a continuous stream of variety shows, concerts, lectures, dinners, street fundraising, and other ad hoc methods that can be devised. Each year, it also holds a major "Rice Bowl" fundraising drive. Because its activities cover a wide range and reach a large number of people, the result is not only the collection of huge sums of money but also a very effective publicity campaign to the American public, truly achieving two goals with one stone. The Fund has 75 branches in various cities across the United States and is still actively promoting and expanding. The headquarters is located in New York due to its strategic importance. Madame Chiang Kai-shek, Soong Mei-ling, is the honorary president of the Fund. Colonel Theodore Roosevelt Jr., former U.S. President's son, who has a strong reputation in the United States, serves as the president, thus wielding significant influence. The members of the headquarters and various branches are all well-known figures from all walks of life, so every activity of the Fund proceeds smoothly. In addition, local officials also provide assistance, resulting in excellent outcomes. The New York World's Fair is a great location for publicity. Due to the war, the Chinese government was unable to participate in the fair last year, which was deeply regretted. This year, the Fund contacted the World's Fair authorities and was granted the former site of the Siamese pavilion free of charge. It was cleaned and renovated by the Fund and displayed jointly with Chinese merchants in the United States, promoting China and achieving significant results. In addition to the above, the Fund often invites American movie stars, famous playwrights, and other well-known figures to make radio broadcasts for publicity. For prominent figures from the Chinese political circles, painters, theater troupes, musicians, and other artistic talents coming to the United States, the Fund always tries every possible means to gather them together, deliver public lectures, hold exhibitions, or provide venues for performances. In short, the Fund exerts all its efforts and empties its brains, not letting any opportunity pass by. It can truly be called extremely hardworking and enthusiastic. Recently, Colonel Weiss, the president of the Fund, realizing that the American public's attention is focused on the European war, particularly the bombing of London, and fearing that China may be forgotten over time, has intensified its efforts to promote China in major newspapers and magazines, trying to reverse the trend. The results are said to be very good. The following is an excerpt from his recent statement:

"Currently, American attention is mostly focused on the European war, particularly the bombing of London. However, they are unaware that the devastation China has endured over the past three years is similar to that in Europe, and even worse than London. Moreover, China's war of resistance is not only for China's own survival but is fundamentally a struggle for democracy, for the preservation of culture, for the freedom of humanity, and for world peace. Therefore, its goals are highly consistent with the American people's psychology and ideals, and the significance of its sacrifices is the same as that of Britain today. Thus, the success or failure of China's war of resistance affects the United States as much as the success or failure of Britain. Fortunately, Americans are gradually understanding this interconnected relationship. Therefore, I firmly believe that from now on, Americans will continue to increase their enthusiasm for assisting China and will not be overly focused on Europe and Britain. As for the displacement, lack of clothing and food, and the spread of diseases among the Chinese people, the various sufferings are heartbreaking and have long been understood by the world. There is truly no need for me to elaborate further."

The "Rice Bowl" movement organized by the Fund, which caused a sensation throughout the United States, was held in major cities across America in the past two years, with the meaning and purpose of raising donations and promoting the cause. It has achieved remarkable results in the past, with the two "Rice Bowl" movements raising more than 370,000 U.S. dollars. The need for relief for Chinese wounded soldiers and refugees is now even greater than before. The Fund hopes for even better results from this year's movement and has already begun preparations. On September 16 of this year, the Fund announced the official launch of the movement, appointing New York City Mayor La Guardia as the chairman of the nationwide mayoral donation group, Huang Liushuang (Anna May Wong), a highly regarded actress and Chinese American, as the chairman of the nationwide film industry donation group, Carol Bruce, a famous young New York theater actress, as the chairman of the young theater industry donation group, and Niles Trammell, general manager of the N.B.C. radio station, as the chairman of the broadcast industry donation group. The chairmen of other industry donation groups are currently being contacted. The annual "Rice Bowl" rally is scheduled to be held within the first week of November. Major cities will be organized by local branches of the Fund, with events including "Rice Bowl" banquets and variety shows. Detailed programs have not yet been formally announced. New York has already scheduled a dinner and dance at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel on November 1, and an "Open-Air Rally" will be held in Chinatown. At that time, there will surely be a lively and boisterous atmosphere.

### Random Chat about the European War (22); The Duke of Windsor's New Position

The Duke of Windsor is forty-six years old, and he looks younger than his age. Especially when viewed from a distance, he looks particularly young. He himself said, "I am neither old nor young," which is absolutely true. His eyes, which used to be chubby and the subject of jokes, are now different. When he talks or laughs, the wrinkles at the corners of his eyes are visible. It would be a joke to say that he is still a child.

At the same time, his brisk and agile steps, thick and lustrous hair that gently brushes over his eyebrows when a breeze blows, his enthusiasm, and informality all make him seem very young, appearing to be only forty-one or forty-two years old.

The Duke of Windsor also has the nature of an athlete. Five minutes after the "Somerset" ship sailed, he removed his tie, and on deck, he always wore a short-sleeved cream or light yellow sports shirt, blue shorts, and sometimes a printed handkerchief around his neck, with blue soft-soled shoes on his feet. He bought these shoes in Hamilton for thirteen shillings (equivalent to two dollars and sixty cents in U.S. currency), and occasionally wore them barefoot. His arms are not muscular but still shapely, and the section below the bend of his arm is tanned dark by the sun. When he doesn't wear socks, his ankles are visible, smooth and very white.

The former king speaks quickly and forcefully, making it difficult to understand. When talking to people, she calls him "Duke," and he calls her "Duchess," which is very formal. But in front of journalists and photographers, the Duke of Windsor repeatedly calls his wife "darling," in a very natural manner. She, on the other hand, has never called her husband that way in public. Both the Duke and Duchess laugh freely and unreservedly, the Duke of Windsor's laughter being "ha-ha-ha," which fully expresses his open heart. Her laughter is slow and natural, and her blue eyes are very charming and touching. The Duke of Windsor has an extremely strong memory for people's names and faces, which is incredibly useful. When he was on the throne, he reviewed countless army and navy troops, and as a rule, during the review, he would always stop and casually ask a few questions to those being reviewed. When hosting a large number of journalists, he always had a few considerate words for each person, which moved the listeners. For example, when he saw the New York Times reporter, he asked about Mr. Philip. He had always been the New York Times correspondent in Paris, covering the news about Edward's abdication and marriage. The Duchess of Windsor did not have this ability as much as her husband. When meeting guests, she would always pat her mouth with a handkerchief, smile, and say, "Hello."

The Duke of Windsor smokes both pipe tobacco and cigarettes—often smoking a pipe and then immediately lighting a cigarette. His wife joked with him, imitating his various poses when lighting his pipe. She said she had memorized four styles.

The Duchess is very particular about dressing. She is meticulous and attentive to her attire. Recently, because the couple had to travel from France by boat across the sea, it was not easy, and the clothes she wore were not as beautiful as before. She wore the same outfit when she landed in Hamilton and when she arrived in the Bahamas. In the past, she would never have done this. The outfit consisted of a pink and blue shirt and a light blue jacket. A beaded "Julia" style hat, with the brim in front. On the ship, she often wore a printed silk shirt, covered with a blue jacket, decorated with yellow, which is the couple's favorite color.

The Duchess looks like she is about thirty-six or thirty-seven years old. She speaks slowly, with both British and Southern American accents. Generally speaking, she does not trust politics, but she is very interested in the U.S. November election. Both she and the Duke laughed, saying that they had never seen a photo of Wilkie (the Republican candidate for president of the United States) with his feet on the ground, meaning that all the photos of Wilkie they had seen had his feet resting on his desk.

They both love photography very much and are themselves the best subjects for photographers. The Duke of Windsor spent twenty minutes on the ship checking everything prepared by the photographer DuPont. Finally, the couple decided that after arriving in Nassau, they would set up a photographic darkroom in the Governor's Mansion.

Anyone who has seen the Duke and Duchess of Windsor in person knows that their photos in many newsreels are nothing like them, especially the ones taken at the time of their marriage. The Duchess even frankly said that she has a mole on her right cheek, but it was carelessly captured by the camera, and in several newsreels, it looked extremely ugly. What she meant was that neither she nor the Duke of Windsor wanted to "show off" on the screen like movie stars, but on the other hand, they also had the right not to have their unsightly aspects captured by the camera. Therefore, she was very pleased to see the photographer on the ship checking the light and measuring the angles. At least this way, any blemishes on her face could be maintained as they were, and not be exacerbated, causing the entire face to suffer.

The Duke and Duchess of Windsor had informal conversations with us reporters on the ship, covering many topics and speaking frankly. They talked about various methods of military censorship, the political connections of American newspapers and publishers, the management of the London Times, the question of whether the British Archbishop also participated, American food, cars, and so on. When the Duke spoke to people, he often turned to his wife, as if to say, "What do you think?" The Duke and Duchess show great affection for each other, often unconsciously revealing it.

The Duke of Windsor and his wife are extremely fond of their three small hunting dogs. Wherever they go, these three dogs often follow. The Duke affectionately calls them "masters," while his adjutant really dislikes them, calling them "bandits."

The Duke of Windsor is five feet six inches tall, and his body is very proportionate. According to his tailor, his measurements are chest 36 inches, waist 29 inches, hips 36 inches, and pants 29 inches. The Duchess is slightly shorter than him, slender and graceful. The two standing together are truly a beautiful couple. (To be continued)

### American and French Consuls General Arrived in Shanghai Together Yesterday Morning; American Consul General Scheduled to Officially Take Office Today; Efforts Will Be Made to Expedite the Realization of Evacuation of Nationals

The President Coolidge of the American President Lines arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning from the United States. The newly appointed American Consul General to Shanghai, Lockhead, and the newly appointed French Consul General, Mageley, as well as the Counselor of the French Embassy, ​​Pengu, all arrived in Shanghai on the ship. The details are recorded below:

### U.S. Consul General

Arrived Ashore in the Rain, Greeted Extensively

Lockhart, who was returning to Shanghai from the United States, was originally scheduled to come with his wife. However, en route, he received an order from the U.S. government to evacuate American citizens, so upon reaching Hawaii, he waited for the ship to turn back. Mr. Lockhart then traveled alone on the President Coolidge liner, arriving at the port at seven o'clock yesterday morning. He transferred to the small tugboat "Manila Maru" and disembarked at the New Customs Wharf at nine o'clock in the morning. U.S. military and government officials stationed in Shanghai, as well as Mr. Lockhart's friends, braved the rain to welcome him. Mr. Lockhart disembarked amidst cheers and shook hands with the welcomers one by one. At that time, some American expatriates inquired about Mr. Lockhart's opinion on the U.S. government's withdrawal of expatriates from the Far East. Mr. Lockhart stated that the U.S. government's order must be implemented as fully as possible. He then took his consulate car to the U.S. Consulate on Jiangxi Road to rest.

Will Take Office This Morning

After arriving at the consulate, Mr. Lockhart met with newspaper reporters and stated that he would be taking office soon. According to this newspaper's investigation, Mr. Lockhart and acting Consul General Patrick had already agreed yesterday afternoon to handle the handover this morning and officially take office. Mr. Lockhart first served as a counselor at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing. When the previous U.S. Consul General Gauss was promoted to Minister to Australia, he also served as acting Consul General in Shanghai. Therefore, he is very familiar with the situation in China and is indeed a friend of China. Those who arrived in port on the same ship as Mr. Lockhart also included Mr. Caldwell, the U.S. Consul General in Tianjin, and Mr. Dunbar, the U.S. Vice Consul in Shanghai.

Acting Consul General Will Return Home Next Month

Acting Consul General Patrick has been serving as acting Consul General in Shanghai since the previous Consul General Gauss returned to his country, for almost four months, with remarkable achievements. He has put even more effort into the work of evacuating American citizens. Now that the new Consul General has arrived in Shanghai, someone is available to take over his responsibilities, and he is scheduled to return to his country with his wife on the U.S. mail ship President Pierce on the first of next month.

### French Consul General

Landed on the Bund in the French Concession

The previous French Consul General, Oki, resigned after the establishment of the Petain government. Mr. Majella, who was in the United States, was appointed by the Vichy government to take over as the French Consul General in Shanghai. Mr. Majella arrived on the President Coolidge liner yesterday morning around four o'clock and landed at the French Bund wharf amidst military music. At that time, the French Concession defense forces and the French Concession police sent a large number of soldiers and police to guard the area.

Took Office Immediately After Arriving at the Consulate

After landing, Mr. Majella shook hands with the welcomers with a smile and went directly by car to the consulate at No. - 公館馬路. Those who came with the French Consul General this time also included Mr. Peng Gu, Counselor of the French Embassy in China, and his wife. After the new French Consul General arrived at the consulate, he rested briefly and then took office, meeting with his subordinates one by one.

Mr. and Mrs. Majella Are Well-Known Figures in Diplomatic Circles

According to a Havas News Agency report from Shanghai, the new Consul General Majella is 40 years old. He was first assigned as an embassy attaché on June 2, 1921, and then assigned to the embassy in Belgium at the end of that year. In December of the following year, he was promoted to Secretary of the Embassy in Germany. In August 1933, he was promoted to First Secretary of the Embassy in the United Kingdom. At that time, the French Ambassador to the United Kingdom and the embassy counselor were both unmarried, so Mrs. Majella hosted the guests at every banquet. Mrs. Majella was graceful and luxurious, and was well-known in London diplomatic circles. In 1939, he was promoted to Counselor of the Embassy in the United Kingdom and participated in all the important negotiations between the United Kingdom and France, making many contributions. In September of that year, when the European war broke out, Mr. Majella asked the government to join the army, but the then Foreign Minister Reynaud not only did not approve it, but instead recalled Mr. Majella to serve as the Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It was not until the end of June of this year that he was appointed as the Consul General in Shanghai. In addition to his wife, Mr. Majella also brought three children with him.

Counselor Peng Gu Has Held Important Positions

Mr. Peng Gu, Counselor of the French Embassy, who came to Shanghai on the same ship as the French Consul General Majella, has long been renowned in diplomatic circles. According to a Havas News Agency report from Shanghai, the new Embassy Counselor Peng Gu is the nephew of Mr. Peng Gu, the former Prime Minister of the French Cabinet. He is 42 years old. On August 18, 1922, he was assigned as an embassy attaché. The following year, he served as Secretary of the Embassy in the United States. During the ten years from 1923 to 1930, he was repeatedly assigned to attend meetings of the League of Nations, achieving remarkable results in diplomatic negotiations. For example, when the Disarmament Conference was held in January 1932, Mr. Peng Gu served as the Secretary-General of the French delegation. After returning to his country, he twice served as the Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In August 1930, when the League of Nations held its 15th General Assembly, he was again assigned as the Secretary-General of the French delegation. In 1935, he served as the First Secretary of the Embassy in Romania. Later, he served as the Commissioner of Intelligence at the Embassy in the United States. After the outbreak of the war, he made unique contributions to the establishment of the Propaganda Department. It was not until June of this year that he was entrusted with his current position.

### Nanshi: Precautions Remain Strict, Residents Do Not Leave the City, Market Conditions are Desolate

Since the military police tightened their inspection of all iron gates along Minguo Road on the 21st, the strict measures regarding those without "citizen certificates" have not yet been cancelled after many days. The civilians living in Nanshi are also taking precautions themselves and staying at home to avoid the patrols and inspections by the Japanese military police and "municipal police." The Nine Acres area, which was originally the commercial center of Nanshi, is now experiencing a sudden economic slump due to restrictions on entering and leaving Nanshi and the concessions. All gambling dens have a feeling of "deserted doors and few carriages."

### Deadline for Winter Clothing Allowance Approaching, All Sectors Enthusiastically Contributing, Expected to Exceed Double the Target by the End of the Month

Since the movement to raise funds for winter clothing allowances was launched in all sectors of Shanghai, it has been actively carried out with all efforts. This movement is of profound significance, and it is not only about the thin clothes of the soldiers at the front and the cries of hunger and cold of the people in the rear. Therefore, those who have been persuaded to donate and contribute are very enthusiastic. It is said that the funds raised have now exceeded the expected target (500,000 yuan). The 31st of this month is the deadline for this movement. In this short distance of one week, it is also the last opportunity for all sectors of Shanghai to make efforts. It is expected that the fundraising results will be doubled.

### The Situation in the Japanese Blockade Zone in West Shanghai is Extremely Serious, Thousands of People Have No Supplies and Will Become Starving Corpses, Residents Send Letters Describing the Tragic Situation, Urgently Hoping That People with a Sense of Justice Will Pay Attention

The English-language "Da Mei Daily" reported that after Sergeant Saito Seiichi of the Japanese military police was shot and killed by three assassins near No. 608 Jisi Fei Road (i.e., Qianjia Lane, leading to Yuyuan Road) last week, the Japanese side immediately implemented a "counter-lockdown" on the lane, and then declared that the blockade had been lifted on the morning of Sunday. In fact, the connection between the 4,000 Chinese residents of the lane and the outside world is still being cut off by the Japanese side today (the 23rd).

All Kinds of Food Have Been Sold Out, Food is Extremely Scarce. Although Several Bags of Rice Have Been Seen Transported into the Lane, It is Not Yet Known for Sure Whether This Rice Will Be Used to Help the Residents. It is Said That There is a Chinese Food Store Near the Entrance of Xujia Lane to Jisi Feier Road. In the First Two Days, It Was Still Able to Supply the Residents of the Lane with its Stock, but It Was All Sold Out by Sunday. At the Beginning of This Week, the Residents of the Area Were Forced to Buy Flags for Five Yuan and Eight Corners, with Black Borders Around the Flags to Show "Mourning" for the Killed Japanese Military Police.

Want to Implement the Baojia System. It is Said That the Japanese Authorities in West Shanghai, i.e., the Japanese Military Police Team Transferred from Wuxi, Now Plan to Implement the "Baojia" System, Forcing Ten Households to Elect a Jia Head and One Hundred Households to Elect a Bao Head. If an Incident Occurs, the Baojia Head Closest to the Scene of the Incident Must Be Responsible and Punished. It is Believed That Nanshi is Also Planning to Implement This System. In the Past Few Days, Nanshi Has Been Heavily Guarded, and Chinese Residents Must Replace Their Passes. The Curfew, Which Has Been Suspended for Five Months, Has Also Been Reinstated. In Addition to Inspecting the New Passes of Chinese Residents, the Japanese Military Police in Nanshi Also Search Pedestrians and Vehicles on the Main Roads.

Residents' Letters Describe the Tragic Situation. Yesterday, a resident of Lane 668, Yuyuan Road, sent a letter to this newspaper, saying, "Editor, I have read today's report in your newspaper on the news that a part of the northern district of Yuyuan Road in West Shanghai was blockaded due to the assassination of a Japanese military policeman. It vaguely stated that it had been opened at 5:30 p.m. yesterday. This is not very consistent with the facts. The blockaded area is 'all areas north to Kainar Road, south to Yuyuan Road, west to Yidingpan Road, and east to Jisi Fei Road (except for the alleys along the road that have no back door).' This area covers more than 300 acres. In addition to the alleys along the road, there are a total of

More Than 7,000 Residents. Qianjia Lane, which is mentioned in the newspaper, is the more lively street in the area. There are countless other roads, from independent houses to smaller alleys and old-style rural bungalows. There are also about 20 factories, with 2,000 to 3,000 people per month. Since the assassination occurred on the afternoon of last Friday, all the entrances to the surrounding roads in the entire area have been blockaded. In the first two days, residents were occasionally allowed to go out to buy vegetables. Recently, it has become increasingly strict, and no one is allowed to enter or leave. Occasionally, relatives and friends of residents buy food outside and want to deliver it across the alley

Bamboo Fence. They Are Also Prevented. It Has Been Four Days Now. Except for the Telephone, There Is Absolutely No Contact With the Outside World. There Was Originally a Small Vegetable Market and Several Food Stores in Qianjia Lane. They Have All Been Sold Out in the Past Two or Three Days. Moreover, Most of the Residents There Are Poor and Have No Food to Last Overnight. Once Blockaded, They Are Afraid That They Will All Become Starving Corpses. Some of the Residents Are Outside (Of Course, They Cannot Return Home). I Have

Blockade Date and Opening Method. I Don't Know What to Do. In Short, the Current Situation There is Very Tense, and it is a Matter of the Lives of More Than 7,000 People, Which is Quite Serious. In the Current Environment, Of Course, Public Opinion Has Lost Its Power, But Justice is in the Hearts of the People. Through the Truthful Propaganda of Your Newspaper, Perhaps in a Helpless Situation, I Can Get One or Two

Slightly Just People to Pay Attention and Achieve Practical Results. I Am Also a Person Whose Home is in That Area. Recently, I Have Temporarily Been Sheltered at a Friend's Place and Have Been Separated From My Family for Four Days. I Have Experienced it Personally and Know More Details. Therefore, I Do Not Hesitate to Spend Words and Dare to Express My Opinion. I Hope You Will Consider it. Sincerely Yours, A Resident of Lane 668, Yuyuan Road, October 22.

### Trade Negotiations Between the UK and France Begin in Hong Kong and Vietnam, Heard That An Agreement Has Been Reached, Waiting for Concrete Decisions, British Ships Sailing to Gong Prefecture Quietly Waiting for the Lifting of the Ban

British merchant ships sailing to various ports in French-owned Vietnam, since the signing of the transit agreement between France and Japan, the British naval authorities stationed in the Far East, in view of maritime safety, ordered the suspension of sailing pending further orders. British merchant ships Taikoo and Jardine here have changed their routes to Hong Kong, Siam, Singapore and other places.

Territorial Ports. The British naval authorities ordered each British shipping company to decide to suspend sailing to Vietnam. Following the rise of British merchant ships, four ships of the French Mail Ship Company, Los, Yaro, Jindia, and Datainan, have sailed. In addition to the Los ship, which departed from Shanghai to Haiphong and Saigon on the 20th, the Yaro ship was originally scheduled to leave Shanghai this morning to sail south, but because it was fumigating the ship in Shanghai and loading cargo today, it was changed to sail to Defence Gong tomorrow. The Jindia ship arrived in Shanghai early today, carrying more than 13,000 bags of foreign rice, and is scheduled to go to Defense Gong on the 26th. The Datainan ship is expected to arrive here at the end of the month. As for British ships sailing to French-owned territories, they have disappeared, but

British Ships Resuming Sailing to Various Ports in Vietnam Has a Good Chance of Resuming. According to information obtained by the shipping industry, the British authorities in Hong Kong have already begun trade negotiations between Hong Kong and Vietnam with the French authorities, including British ships sailing to Guangzhou Bay, Haiphong, Saigon, and various French-owned ports. Although it has not yet reached a concrete stage, the restoration of British goods trade and ships is only a matter of time. It is heard that an agreement has been reached in the negotiations, and a concrete plan will be sought in subsequent negotiations. Therefore, once Hong Kong and Vietnam resume shipping, there will be no problem for Taikoo and Jardine ships in Shanghai to resume sailing. The authorities of the two companies are quietly waiting for the lifting order from the Hong Kong head office.

### After the News of the Evacuation Spread, British Expatriates Remained Calm, Believing That There Would Be No Changes in the Situation for the Time Being, A Few Children Have Already Left Shanghai

Since the British side announced the day before yesterday that British expatriates who do not need to stay in Shanghai should consider evacuating, British expatriates in Shanghai discussed this issue yesterday, but they were all extremely calm and still could not change their wait-and-see attitude, believing that there would be no drastic changes in the situation for the time being. This statement has been circulating for a week, but all parties believe that it is more difficult than the evacuation of American expatriates, because most of the British merchant ships are assisting the British government in carrying out other wartime necessities, so there is a great lack of shipping equipment for evacuating expatriates. However, in the past week, a few children of British expatriates have been led by their mothers to Canada and Australia.

The UK Hopes Expatriates Will Leave

Reuters, London, 23rd. A Reuters diplomatic correspondent said that reliable sources in London believed that although British Ambassador to Japan Clark had not implemented emergency measures to recall British expatriates traveling in Japan, British people who did not have important matters to stay in Japan should take advantage of this travel convenience to leave the country.

The Number of American Expatriates Evacuating Continues to Increase

As for the issue of American expatriates evacuating, according to yesterday's news, the number of people applying to book cabins has continued to increase compared to a few days ago. They are not hesitant to pay twice as much for travel expenses as ordinary mail ships. However, American expatriates are pleased that Secretary of State Hull has paid close attention to their complaints about the high cost of shipping and has stated that the government will find ways to prevent shipping companies from taking advantage of the current situation to profit. It is also heard that in addition to sending telegrams to Washington requesting economic assistance for American expatriates who are unable to evacuate, some American expatriate groups have suggested leasing Dutch ships for evacuation.

### Traffic in the French Concession Resumes, All Roads Open to Traffic This Morning, Took Time to Organize, Some Roads Opened to Traffic Yesterday, Temporary Workers of Chinese and Russian Nationality Have Been Dismissed

After the French Tramway Company strike, representatives from both labor and management signed a resumption of work agreement at the Luban Road Main Factory the day before yesterday (22nd). All employees of the company's machinery department, vehicle department, and engine room, more than 1,000 people in total, resumed work yesterday. However, because the agreement was not completed until 6 p.m. the day before yesterday, most of the workers did not have time to notify them that night, and the workers detained in the police station were not released until 9 p.m. Therefore, the workers who resumed work did not arrive at the factory until noon. The company sent pressure cars to inspect the tracks and electric wires everywhere. The workers in the machinery department also began repairing the vehicles. It was not until about 1 p.m. that the inspection of the tracks and electric wires everywhere was completed.

Cars Driven in the Afternoon. At 1 p.m., the organization work was completed in part. More than 10 trams on Route 2, more than 10 trolleybuses on Route 17, and 20 buses on Route 22 were dispatched from the factory to resume operation. By 3 p.m., trams on Routes 1, 7, and 10 had also resumed operation. Other trolleybuses on Routes 18 and 24, buses on Route 21, and all vehicles connected to the Public Concession were scheduled to resume operation completely this morning.

Short-Term Workers Dismissed. During this strike, the factory hired more than 100 temporary Chinese workers and more than 50 Russian workers, so the tap water engine room and coppersmith room were able to operate as usual. Until yesterday, in order to fulfill the signed conditions, the factory issued dismissal fees to these temporary workers and dismissed them.

Universal Allowance. There are a total of more than 200 staff members in the French Tap Water and Electricity Company on Luban Road. They were not involved in the strike this time. However, after the workers and the management signed the conditions, the company's staff members also benefited in the same way. For example, after the workers were given wage increases and rice allowances, the staff members were also treated the same. Therefore, this time the workers' allowance was increased by six yuan, and the company's staff members were also given an additional six yuan without exception.

### India Donates to Support the British War Effort, No Explicit Announcement, Indians Donate Voluntarily

According to a foreign reporter in Shanghai, people from all walks of life in India have voluntarily donated more than 1,500 rupees to the Governor-General's wartime donation and the St. Dunstan's donation, which shows that India is extremely sympathetic to the UK. Since the outbreak of the European war, the Governor-General of India has advocated for wartime donations. Although there is no explicit announcement, people from all walks of life have donated very enthusiastically, either donating 100,000 rupees or donating a few Annas, or deducting a certain amount from the donor's salary every month. Although the amount is not very large, it accumulates gradually and gradually forms a huge amount.

### Coolidge Liner Passengers Experienced Dangers En Route, A Major Case of Robbery and Murder Occurred on Board, And a Hurricane Broke a Priest's Leg, All Passengers Were Refreshed After Arriving in Shanghai

The English-language "Da Mei Evening News" reported that the President Coolidge, a transpacific mail ship of the American President Lines, departed from the Old Gold Mountain and arrived in Shanghai this morning (13th). The ship had experienced dangerous events such as assassinations and hurricanes during this voyage, but the passengers who arrived in Shanghai all looked happy and full of energy, and were eager to ask about the current situation in Shanghai.

Murder for Money, Chinese Died Miserably

The President Coolidge left San Francisco 19 days ago. That night, a middle-aged Chinese passenger in third class was found hanging in the washroom, but there was a deep wound on the back of his head, which was obviously caused by someone hitting him and then deliberately creating the suspicion of hanging. Moreover, when he boarded the ship, he was carrying 10,000 Hong Kong dollars, worth 5,000 US dollars, which was also missing. Therefore, when the ship arrived in Honolulu, US detectives boarded the ship to investigate, but it was never found out who the victim was.

After Receiving the News of the Evacuation, Many People Turned Back

The news of the State Department's order to evacuate American expatriates from the Far East shocked the passengers who were planning to come to Shanghai and did not know what to do, especially women and children, because they did not know whether they would be allowed to disembark in Shanghai. Many women and children who were planning to come to Shanghai immediately disembarked in Honolulu and stopped their journey to the East.

Met a Storm En Route, Passengers Were Injured

Six days ago, when the President Coolidge was 600 miles from Yokohama, it suddenly encountered a hurricane, which lasted for three hours. The wind speed was 111 miles per hour, causing many portholes on the side of the ship to break and many passengers to be slightly injured. Four missionaries were seriously injured, one of whom was Dr. Thomas, a doctor from the American Northern Baptist Church in Shanghai. He was shocked on the side of the ship, jumped up, and fell on the other side, causing a hip injury and a broken leg. The injury was quite serious, and it was suggested that he disembark in Yokohama for treatment, but Mr. Thomas preferred to come to Shanghai for treatment. The other three missionaries left the ship in Yokohama and were sent to the hospital.

### Carrying Copper Coins for Export: Limit of 200 Coins

Order from the Ministry of Finance: Investigations have revealed that the clandestine export of copper coins must be strictly prohibited. Travel to areas under enemy occupation should be considered the same as export. If such clandestine exports are discovered, they will be dealt with according to the revised Provisional Regulations for the Punishment of Offenses Against the National Currency. Those who carry new subsidiary coins will also be handled according to the aforementioned regulations. Furthermore, as subsidiary coin notes and new subsidiary coins are now widely circulating in various regions and are sufficient for small transactions, from now on, passengers and ship employees carrying single copper coins for export should have the limit revised to no more than 200 coins per person per trip, to show restriction and prevent smuggling.

### Bodyguard Fired: Claims Promise Fulfillment, Blood Transfusion for Xu Maotang's Father's Illness, Seeks 12,240 Yuan in Living Expenses

Hu Chengdong, 43 years old, from Hua County, Henan, residing at 525 Henan Road, recently filed a petition through lawyer Zhou Yongquan to the Civil Division of the Special No. 2 Court against Xu Maotang, manager of the China Remittance Bank (41 years old, from Ningbo, residing at 65 Zhengjia Lane, West Aihans Road),

seeking mediation for payment of 12,240 yuan in living expenses. The petition stated that the plaintiff was introduced to the Xu residence as a bodyguard in 1927, with a monthly salary of 26 yuan. Subsequently, due to his loyalty and diligence, he was favored by the master and his salary was increased to 38 yuan. In 1931, the old master, Qingyun Gong, fell seriously ill. After medical diagnosis, it was determined that a blood transfusion was necessary before surgery could be performed to support the patient's body. Therefore, the

entire household's servants were tested, and only the tea server Yu Along and the plaintiff had the same blood type as the old master. At that time, the defendant, Xu Maotang, stated that if someone could donate blood for his father, they would be an "Xu family benefactor" and would be supported by him forever. At the time, anxious to save the old master's life, the plaintiff readily agreed. After the doctor performed the blood transfusion, although Qingyun Gong could not extend his life, the plaintiff suffered from excessive blood loss, resulting in muscle aches and bone pain whenever it was windy or rainy,

resembling a cripple. He thought that since he would be supported by the master for the rest of his life, there was no need to worry about unemployment, and his mind was at ease. Unexpectedly, last year, the defendant used the excuse of cutting expenses and went back on his word, dismissing the plaintiff, clearly "killing the dog after the rabbit is dead," violating his promise. It is impermissible to buy people's blood with money. Now, the defendant, a prominent figure in society, has broken his promise, causing someone to donate blood for his relative,

violating contractual obligations, which is unacceptable both legally and morally. Therefore, he filed a petition requesting the defendant to appear in court for mediation, fulfill his contractual obligations, and pay the living expenses of 12,240 yuan in one lump sum, calculated at 60 yuan per month until the age of 60. Yesterday, Judge Shen Youqi heard the case. The defendant's lawyer, Yu Xilou, appeared in court and stated that he did not agree with the plaintiff's request. After questioning, the court ordered the plaintiff to formally file a lawsuit.

### Two Russian Robbers Attempt to Snatch Handgun: Constable Courageously Resists, Russian Robbers Ultimately Fail

Around 8 PM the previous evening, a Chinese constable, No. 42, stationed by the Shanzhong Road police station of the French Concession at the intersection of Yaozhujiao Road and Avenue Petain, was suddenly approached by two Russian robbers. One of them immediately threw a bag of yellow sand at his head. The constable, seeing the situation, knew they were not good people and punched him to the ground. At that time, another White Russian bravely rushed forward, attempting to snatch his official handgun. Fortunately, the constable was exceptionally alert, quickly dodged and drew his firearm, firing four shots. The White Russian who had fallen also jumped up and returned two shots, none of which hit. Subsequently, the two Russians fled headlong and disappeared without a trace. As a result, the constable's hat brim was pierced with a hole.

### Maid Forges Documents, Fraudulently Impersonates, Sentenced to Four Months Imprisonment

Li Jiping, a Cantonese dentist residing at No. 40 Jing'an Villa, Jing'an Temple Road, had his stepmother, Feng Jinghui, living in Suzhou. He employed a Suzhou woman, Mao Peiying, as a maid for several years. From the 5th to the 16th of this month, Mao Peiying suddenly presented letters from Feng Jinghui and went to Li Jiping's office four times, taking a total of half a dollar's worth of dental gold. After Li Jiping discovered that Mao had actually forged Feng's letters and fraudulently impersonated her, he reported the matter to the Jing'an Temple police station.

### "Slot Machine King" Continued Trial in American Court: Attorney Announces Public Prosecution Established, Possible Sentence of 85 Years

Jack Lallie, an American Jewish man known as the "Slot Machine King," was previously arrested and sent to the American Court in China by Li Quesheng, executor and acting local lawyer of the American Court, for 17 counts of gambling. Judge Hillmic interrogated him. At that time, Lallie claimed that he had acquired "Chinese" nationality and was not a US citizen, requesting to be found not guilty. Subsequently, the judge ordered him to be released on bail of $11,000 US dollars pending trial. At the same time, the American court immediately investigated his nationality. Yesterday morning, the case was continued in the American court. Because the local lawyer, Li Quesheng, had reported to the judge's office that Lallie was indeed a US citizen, Judge Hillmic briefly questioned him and then declared that the public prosecution of the case had been established. Lallie's crimes totaled 17 counts, and if convicted on all counts, he could face a sentence of 85 years in prison. It has been investigated that Lallie has lived in Shanghai for nearly 18 years.

### Extortion by Submission Case, Judgment After Trial, Both Defendants Confess Everything

The Poor Children's School Relief Center, Room 519, Pudong Fellow Association, Edward Road, was founded by Zhang Guoquan, a local resident. He hired prominent figures to serve as directors and established 42 free schools with the aim of providing education to poor children. The initial source of funding was a grant of 10,000 yuan from the National Relief Committee. Later, due to insufficient funds, he publicly broadcast three times, appealing to

all sectors of society for donations, raising more than 20,000 yuan. On the 17th and 28th, two days, a local newspaper suddenly published two chapters of a novel entitled "Philanthropist" under the name of Gao Fei, which implicitly revealed the inside story of the Poor Children's School Relief Center. The so-called Gao Fei's real name was Luo Jiahua, a teacher at the Huanan Middle School on Nanjing Road. Since his

manuscript was published, his friend Xue Hequn (a collection clerk in the insurance department of the Lihuo Foreign Firm on Sichuan Road) colluded with Luo, writing a letter to Zhang, with lines containing extortion and coercion. After several contacts, they met at the MeiHua Restaurant in Xieqiao Lane, handed over 1,000 yuan. At that time, Zhang Guoquan reported it to the Chengdu Road Police Station, dispatching detective Ni Runsheng to arrest Luo and Xue

and send them to the Special No. 1 Court for questioning and detention. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhong Qing continued the trial in the Second Criminal Division. Police lawyer Li Zhishan filed charges according to the law, and stated that no new evidence has been found in the retrial, and both defendants have confessed everything, and there are confession forms, please investigate. Questioned the defendants, who hired lawyers Gu Hanli and Li Yiming to defend them. The court declared the debate in this case concluded and set the sentencing date for the 30th. Both defendants were sent back into custody.

### Zhu Xiuting Sues Bailiff: Sues to Confirm Handwriting

Zhu Xiuting, residing at No. 8 Yuanli, Limei Road, French Concession, owed the Zhejiang Industrial Bank 3,000 yuan in current account funds, which he delayed in repaying. The bank entrusted a lawyer to act as an agent to sue in the Civil Division of the Special No. 2 Court. Zhu also entrusted a lawyer to act as an agent for the defense, but the result was a failure, and the judgment was to pay back the principal and interest in full. The judgment was delivered to Zhu Xiuting by bailiff Chen Luzhen in person. Later, Zhu refused to accept the judgment and appealed to the Third Branch of the High Court, but because the time had exceeded the statutory appeal period, it was dismissed. Now Zhu claims that the judgment was delayed by the bailiff, and that he did not legally receive it, believing that the handwriting on the receipt was inconsistent with his signature. Therefore, he entrusted lawyer Gu Jirong to file a lawsuit in the Civil Division of the Special Court against bailiff Chen Luzhen, seeking to confirm the handwriting. After Judge Liao Yuan opened the court, it was deemed inappropriate for the plaintiff to pay litigation fees in accordance with a case without value. The court ordered him to pay an additional 92 yuan in litigation fees according to the value of the subject matter of the previous case and rescheduled the trial. Now that Zhu has paid the litigation fees in full, the court continued

the trial yesterday afternoon. The result was a discussion to reschedule the investigation.

### Automobile Transporting Opium Case: Ding Guohua Also Arrested, Qian Yangyuan's Mother Lured Him Out to Report to Police, Using the Alias Ding Shaotang, Interrogated and Ordered to be Detained

Qian Yangyuan and Liu Mingsheng, the accountants previously assigned to "The Sino-Japanese Economic Research Society" at No. 82 Tongfu Road, drove Li Hongzhang's grandson Li Ruijiu's No. 9118 automobile, driven by driver Cao Musheng, to transport 128 taels of opium to a buyer at a certain number on Shandong Road. It was investigated and seized by the Narcotics Division of the Public Concession Police. The three, Qian, Liu and Cao, were arrested and sent to the Special No. 1 Court. They confessed that the opium was delivered on the instructions of the host of the association,

Ding Guohua.

The court concluded the trial and sentenced Qian and Liu to five years imprisonment and a fine of 1,000 yuan each, and Cao Musheng to two years and six months imprisonment on file. Qian Yangyuan's mother, Qian Huang, felt that her son's conviction was entirely due to Ding Guohua, while Ding himself was still at large, which was difficult to accept. Later, she learned that Ding was hiding in Room 323 of the Cangzhou Hotel on Jing'an Temple Road. Therefore, after the court's decision, she

rushed to the Cangzhou Hotel,

luring Ding to come out. Ding initially thought it was a negotiation about his son's living expenses after his conviction, so he followed her out. Unexpectedly, when they reached the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Seymour Road, she reported to the police and arrested Ding, bringing him back to the Jing'an Temple Police Station. Because this case was handled by the Narcotics Division, it was transferred to the capital. Ding reported his name to the police station as Ding Shaotang, 33 years old, from Wuxing, Zhejiang. However, in order to evade guilt, he denied being named Ding Guohua. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Criminal Division of the Special No. 1 Court. Ding was tall and sturdy,

wearing an expensive suit.

Police lawyer Ru Baoyi requested temporary detention because the case required urgent investigation and requested a retrial. Judge Chuan Lin questioned Ding, asking whether he knew Qian Yangyuan. He answered that he did. He hired lawyers Fan Gang and Yu Enliang to defend him. After Judge Chuan questioned him, he ordered Ding Shaotang to be detained and rescheduled the trial for next Thursday.

### Letter

To the Editor: I have just read the Shanghai news column in your newspaper on the 23rd of this month, which contains a news item about the lawsuit involving the transfer of the Chinese Medical College. It mentions that "Ma, etc. transferred the college to the Zhu He Zhu Xiaonan brothers, and the Zhu brothers then competed with each other for the position of dean, resulting in repeated lawsuits." This is not consistent with the facts. Xiaonan is the dean of the New Chinese Medical College, located on Wangjiasha Huayuan Road, which has no relationship with the Chinese Medical College on Chongqing Road, nor has there been any lawsuit with my brother Zhu He Gao to compete for the position of dean. The above record is obviously a misunderstanding. I hereby send this letter, hoping that your newspaper will correct it as soon as possible. Sincerely, Zhu Xiaonan, Dean of the New Chinese Medical College, October 23rd.

Football, equestrian, pentathlon, and Greco-Roman wrestling, which are included in the current World Games, are not included in the Pan American Games.

### The Kong Sheng Cup Final Six: American Team Defeats Gong Hua Team, 5-2; Gong Hua's Performance Especially Good

The eighth match of the Kong Sheng Cup Table Tennis Tournament's final six, was held at the Jingwu Association gymnasium the night before last at 8:00 PM, with the Holy Group champion, the Gong Hua team, playing against the runner-up, the American team. In the group finals previously, the American team had narrowly lost to the other by one point, and this rematch was like enemies meeting on a narrow path, filled with animosity. Seeing the formidable opponent approaching, the Gong Hua team also strove to improve. Immediately after the start, the tension was palpable. In the first match, Yang Zhaoxiang of the American team defeated Chen Ruilong of the Gong Hua team, who played a short blocking style, with quick top-spin shots. In the second match, Ouyang Wei of the American team, an all-rounder, played against Zai Junquan, the captain of the Gong Hua team. Ouyang was the runner-up in the Shanghai individual tournament, with superior skills, while Zai was a rising star. Because Zai had been eliminated in the Jingwu Cup, everyone expected Ouyang to win easily. However, Zai became more courageous as the match progressed, his left-handed top-spin shots were incredibly accurate. After a dramatic five-game match, Zai unexpectedly came from behind to defeat Ouyang Wei, which was commendable. In the third match, Gu Wenxiang of the Gong Hua team lost in a counter-attack to Wang Changhou of the American team. In the fourth match, Rong Deneng of the American team, a skilled chopper, was defeated by Pan Yuexi of the Gong Hua team. After that, Zhang Liansheng, Ye Ziqing, and Huang Zhijun of the American team fought bravely and defeated their opponents in three consecutive matches. As a result, the American team defeated the Gong Hua team 5-2, wiping away their previous shame. Although the Gong Hua team lost, their performance was especially good. The scores are as follows:

### Silver Coin Cup Table Tennis Tournament: Citibank Defeats Communications Bank; Tonight's Matches Should Be Evenly Matched

In the Silver Coin Cup Table Tennis Tournament, Citibank played against Communications Bank the night before last at the Silver Union Club gymnasium. Only three of Citibank's five top players were present, with two substitutes attending, their lineup incomplete. Communications Bank, taking advantage of their victory over the strong Jin Cheng team, performed with extra effort. Therefore, the match between the two sides was very intense. Communications Bank had previously taken the lead at 5-3 and 7-5, but unexpectedly, Ruan Shaorong and Zheng Jiakun of Citibank delivered a stunning performance, winning several points in a row, turning a 7-8 score into a 6-6 tie. At this point, Communications Bank suffered a complete collapse and was overtaken by Citibank. As a result, Communications Bank was defeated by Citibank 8-13, losing a winning opportunity, which was a pity. Main player Liu Jihan won five consecutive matches, which was remarkable. There will be four matches tonight. Apart from the first match where Citibank is likely to easily defeat the China National team, the strength of the remaining teams is quite balanced, making it difficult to predict the winners. The results from the night before last and tonight's schedule are recorded below:

Results from the Night Before Last

Citibank defeated Communications Bank: 13-8

Si Ming defeated Yu Cheng: 13-8

Tonight's Schedule

Citibank vs. China National: 7:00 PM, China

Zhe Xing vs. North America: 7:00 PM, Zhe Xing

Shanghai vs. Communications Bank: 7:00 PM, Shanghai

Zi Kang vs. Jin Cheng: 7:00 PM, Si Ming

### The Zong Jing Cup Table Tennis Finals: Proceeds to Be Used for Charity, Donated to Orphanage

The Zong Jing Cup Team Table Tennis Championship, commissioned by the Shen Xin Textile Company and organized by the Liang Xi Table Tennis Team, is scheduled to hold its finals on the 2nd of next month. On the suggestion of the competition's consultant, Chen Linsheng, the proceeds from ticket sales will be used for charity. According to Rong Deqi, Rong Xiaofan, and Xue Jinsheng of the New Company, they expressed their strong agreement with this matter, willing to donate all the ticket proceeds, without deducting expenses, to the Nanyi Orphanage. Furthermore, if the income is less than 1,000 yuan, the organizers will make up the difference and donate the full amount to the orphanage.

### Letter to the Editor

To the Editor,

Shanghai Orphanage, after the charity basketball game, will launch a charity table tennis competition. However, the method has not been practical. (It involves gathering famous table tennis players from the city based on offensive and defensive styles to hold a match). I would like to offer my humble opinion as follows:

Upon investigation, charity table tennis has been held several times last year, but its popularity was not as enthusiastic as this charity basketball game. The reason lies in the fact that the competition method does not use team names. If the old method is still used this time, it may affect ticket sales. (For example, in this charity basketball game, a certain team against the Paramount sold almost half of the tickets, and those who came to support at the time). If individuals are used as the unit, the ticket sales performance can be predicted. In the past two years, the "Qing Yun" and "American" teams have been the strongest in table tennis. In this summer's Kong Sheng Cup, there were also four rising forces: Huayi A, Jiufeng, Gonghua, and Wanhua A. If teams are used as the unit and the "Charity Basketball Method" is followed to hold multiple matches, on the one hand, each team will definitely work hard for the team's victory, fighting each other and seeking out outstanding talents to adjust their lineups. On the other hand, they will also compete for ticket sales, and the proceeds from ticket sales will definitely be more than the competition with individuals as the unit. The competition schedule can be arranged in the following days:

First Match (1) American vs. Gonghua (2) Qingyun vs. Jiufeng

Second Match (1) American vs. Wanhua A (2) Qingyun

Third Match (1) Qingyun vs. Gonghua (2) American vs. Huayi A

Fourth Match (1) Qingyun vs. Wanhua A (2) American vs. Jiufeng

Fifth Match Table Tennis Championship, Qingyun vs. American

(Note: Before the fifth match, a women's table tennis exhibition match will be arranged to make the atmosphere of the stadium more enthusiastic.

Ticket prices should be reduced as much as possible and can be set at 5 jiao, 1 yuan, and 3 yuan. (The last match can be increased to 5 yuan)

The above method is only a suggestion. If it can be realized, I am willing to donate all the balls used for the competition. I hope everyone will correct me.

Sincerely, Yu Yuanlin, Editor of the Shen Bao Sports Column, October 21st.

### Puddle Splashes; Car Speeds By: British Driver Fined; Pedestrians Suffer; Police Testify and Appeal to the British Consulate

According to the Zi Lin Daily, on October 3rd, the city was flooded due to heavy rain, and there were deep puddles on the streets. A British expatriate named White Locke, who works for the Xintong Automobile Company, drove his car very fast on Jingan Temple Road, causing water to splash everywhere. A rickshaw passenger on the side of the road was splashed with water and suffered greatly. Angered, they asked Coudin, a western police officer from the Xinzha Police Station who witnessed the incident, to testify and appeal to the British Consulate General. Yesterday (the 22nd), Haynes, the inspector of the British Consulate General, summoned White Locke for questioning. Haynes expressed his gratitude to the Public Works Bureau's police department for paying attention to such incidents and appealing to the law. He also stated that drivers should not disregard pedestrians. He had personally witnessed several cars passing by, causing water to splash high, which angered pedestrians. White Locke replied that the car he was driving had a problem and had to continue driving to avoid stopping and blocking traffic. Haynes rebuked him, saying that if the car needed repairs, it should not have been driven out. The defendant disregarded other pedestrians, which was a fact. As a result of the trial, White Locke was fined three shillings, equivalent to 9.75 yuan.

### Britain's Wartime Trade Controls

— Ying Jun

Since the outbreak of the war, Britain has established restrictions on import and export trade and introduced a credit guarantee system to develop foreign trade and consolidate wartime foreign exchange funds. Historically, the greater part of Britain’s peacetime income has come from manufacturing and trade, so maintaining this income in wartime is paramount. However, as a number of European markets fell into German hands, Britain has been unable to obtain the necessary goods and has suffered considerable losses. So, after the outbreak of war, the British government published a list of goods, the export of which from Britain itself was generally prohibited, which caused no small amount of misunderstanding at the time. The public at large thought that the listed goods were to be absolutely prohibited from export, but subsequent events indicated that they could still be freely exported under reasonable conditions, provided that an export license was obtained. This was to prevent a shortage of war goods, because in wartime, the stock of a particular commodity may be abundant one week and suddenly inadequate the following week, so that considerable control becomes necessary.

The British government, understanding the importance of maintaining export trade, has organised an export association to maximise the development of export trade in wartime conditions. To achieve perfect export trade, the Export Association has brought together many industrialists to form an export group and a committee. Special issues such as raw materials, prices, distribution and markets for each industry can be submitted to such committees for complete solutions. Since the formation of these associations by each industry, there has been a good and consistent approach to obtaining the raw materials necessary for export and to determining export prices, and the application for export permits from factories has also been made easier with the help of this body, while the manufacturing industry for export products has also been able to obtain a relatively advantageous position over the manufacturing industry for domestic consumption products. To support domestic manufacturing and to develop export trade, the British government has also introduced and widely implemented a warrant system, whereby the government guarantees to indemnify the seller against all losses where a contract of sale entered into between a British seller and a legitimate foreign customer cannot be fulfilled due to obstruction or if the customer fails to pay the price. Regarding the import of foreign goods into Britain in wartime, the restrictions are very strict. With the exception of goods considered necessary or welcome by the British government, the import of any kind of foreign goods is subject to strict restrictions and any person wishing to import them must first obtain the permission of the government at any time. This is because the import of foreign goods must be settled in foreign currency, which is a precious commodity in wartime and is needed to purchase essential basic goods for the war. At the same time, shipping capacity is only used for the transport of important goods, and if ordinary foreign goods were allowed to be freely imported, this useful capacity would be occupied, which would be detrimental to the war effort.

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no changes in HSBC's listed rates. The unofficial market for GBP/USD was tight after a sharp drop. In the morning, the USD reached 5.90625 yuan due to speculative selling. Hong Kong Telecom sold shillings, and the price also firmed up. Later, due to the need for foreign firms to settle accounts, and the appetite of Mercantile Bank, the supply and demand gradually shifted, and the price returned to level.

The banks' morning spot selling rates were GBP 3 pence 796875, and USD 5.84375, which was unchanged for GBP and 0.03125 tighter for USD compared to the previous day's close, due to the continued decline of the Lira. After opening, the market hardened due to competition among Chinese speculative traders. The USD for this month was bid up by speculators from 5.875 to 5.90625. In addition, Hong Kong Telecom came to sell, selling shillings for this month at 3 pence 8125 and 828125 to foreign firms. HSBC's listed rates remained unchanged.

### Outside Gold Market Continues to Weaken

Yesterday's unofficial market for spot gold continued to weaken. There were reports of transactions at 5,740 yuan, later rebounding slightly by several tens of yuan, and closing at 5,760 yuan, due to the foreign exchange market turning from loose to soft. Jewelry gold prices remained unchanged. Datong Bank still quoted 600 yuan.

### Demand for USD Notes Decreases

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw no opening in the unofficial market for spot gold. However, transactions outside the market had already retreated to around 5,750 yuan, so the prices of GBP and USD notes also fell by 1 yuan each. Demand for GBP notes decreased, and the market price continued to fall by 1 yuan. The USD note price once fell to 16.50 yuan in the morning. The market turned tighter in the afternoon, rising to 16.63 yuan at one point, and finally closing at 16.60 yuan, up 5 fen from the previous day's close.

### Damaged Banknotes (Continued from the 19th)

— Shen Yun

(8) If a strip or more is missing from a note and replaced with another paper to make it a complete sheet, if one of the two serial numbers is damaged, even if more than three-quarters of the note body remains, it will only be exchanged for half the value.

(Explanation) This type of banknote is deliberately created by counterfeiters, who intentionally remove a strip. After removing more than ten strips, they can be pieced together into a complete sheet. The removal method is also a specialized technique, such as removing the front or the back. The removed part is replaced with another piece of paper, while the removed back remains intact. Therefore, those who are unaware are easily misled. When they go to the bank to exchange it, it is only worth half the value. The method of identification is that whenever you encounter a patched banknote, one side is intact without any tears. When you pick it up and look at it, if you see a blank strip, it is a stripped note. However, there are also those that are completely stripped, and there are also those that have one side stripped and replaced with a counterfeit note. There are also those that have one side as a genuine note and one side as a counterfeit note. There are various tricks, so those who receive banknotes must carefully identify them.

(9) Banknotes that have been intentionally damaged will not be exchanged.

(Explanation) If a complete banknote is intentionally torn into several pieces or cut into several strips, even if it is patched completely and intact, it will be deemed invalid and worthless when exchanged at the bank. This is a warning to those who do not abide by public morals and intentionally damage currency. However, this type of loss often affects third parties. Therefore, if a formal business sends a letter to the bank explaining the reason for the mistaken receipt, it may be possible to exchange it for the full amount.

Correction: In item 2 of "Damaged Banknotes" published on the 19th, the phrase "one-quarter" in the sentence "If a note is broken and more than 'one-quarter' remains, it will be exchanged for half the value" should be "one-quarter and one," hereby corrected.

### Yarn and Cotton: Cotton Yarn Bulls Eagerly Anticipate Price Increases; Indian Cotton Eagerly Sought in the Market

The yarn market continued to weaken. In fact, the continuous sharp increases in prices have led to profit-taking and new short selling activities. At the same time, Hong Kong merchants, because prices have reached high levels and recent import volumes have been considerable, are currently less enthusiastic about expensive yarn. Therefore, transactions have tended towards a quieter path. However, the morale of general speculative traders remains high. They absorb Shuang Ma factory orders firmly and do not give up. However, factories and large firms are selling off forward contracts across the board. In this regard, the current situation is certainly strong, but once the reaction comes, it is unknown what will happen.

The opening of the spot yarn market in the morning, because the buyers on the table were all holding several packages of Shuang Ma, would all suffer a loss if the price dropped, and would make a profit if it rose. Therefore, they all shouted and bought 20-count Shuang Ma yarn. The opening price was 1,280 yuan, slightly lower than the previous day. However, there was no shortage of buyers. However, securities firms and large profit-takers came out across the board, and the market turned out to be soft in the midst of strength. After a slight increase by the bulls, it rose slightly to 1,287 yuan. Then it was heard that the market price of a certain exchange was not only unable to advance, but also had a backward trend. At the same time, customer sales were not as strong as the previous day. Although all parties wanted to support it, the environment did not allow it, so it gradually fell to 1,265 yuan. The closing price was 1,268 yuan. According to the statistics of transactions in the half-day, 6,535 bales were traded. Hongzhang Factory launched 1,000 bales of 10-count Xinbao Yi at a price of 900 yuan. It was found that 2,565 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong today. The amounts bought by each group are listed on the left:

Same Industry 5,900 Hong Kong 575 Wenzhou 60 Statistics 6,535

The situation in the cotton market was slightly calmer, because after the sharp increase in the yarn market, there was a change in the wind, so the momentum was slightly calmer. However, the industry's thinking is still firm. However, a batch of Indian cotton will soon arrive to regulate the market.

Foreign cotton market prices: The New York cotton market was slightly more active again. The firm prices of industry purchases and Wall Street stocks resulted in the closing price rising by 4 pounds compared to the previous day. India's price fell by more than 2 rupees yesterday, including forecasts.

The trading of foreign cotton in Shanghai has been very lively in recent days, with spot goods being the most popular. However, because they are scarce in the market, factories have found it difficult to purchase them. Long staple fibers were bought up long ago. Yesterday, short staple fibers also became popular. The price of Indian cotton "pingguoer" jumped by a huge 5-6 yuan yesterday. Generally, it is expected that the price of cotton will rise sharply.

### Grain: Foreign Rice Floods In

Yesterday, foreign rice suddenly turned to a declining trend. At first, the hoarders were still hoping for a good price and demanded firm prices. At that time, the market had not changed. However, the actual sales prices increased, and it was privately estimated that the source of foreign rice arriving continuously. The 250,000 bags previously ordered have all been loaded. In addition to those that have already arrived, the others are also arriving one after another. In addition, retail shipments are even more endless. Therefore, the morale in the market suddenly turned weak and soft. Moreover, foreign orders are still in progress. It is said that the increased special war risk insurance has already been implemented, and it is not a new rule, but a pretext for hoarding goods to cause trouble. Seeing the situation is not good, they take advantage of the high prices to release their holdings, and for a time, everyone echoed each other, and the decline started suddenly. According to the closing market report, the entire city rose and fell together, with the prices depreciating by 1 yuan compared to the previous market. No. 2 Saigon was 63 yuan, No. 2 Siam was 61.78 yuan to 60.05 yuan, Xiaojiao was 61 yuan, Haiphong red tip was 57 yuan, Tokyo tip was 56-57 yuan, and Wuhu tip was also a small yuan, opening at 60.05 yuan to 59.5 yuan. Yesterday, Jianyuan ordered 500 tons of No. 2 Saigon at a price of 73.5 yuan, which was the same as a few days ago. Therefore, no one accepted the return of the original bags.

New Jingjian Yaozhong Baige, etc. continued to arrive in small quantities due to the rain, totaling 1-2,000 bags, so the new Jing continued to be popular in store sales, rising another 1-2 yuan. Yaozhong Baige was only so-so. It was estimated that Kunshan new Jing opened at 75 yuan to 72.5 yuan, original bags at 77 yuan to 76.5 yuan, Qingjiao Yaozhong at 77 yuan, Fengjing Baige at 73.8 yuan, and 73.5 yuan. There was a lack of goods in the wild rice market. Duyangjian remained empty, with all original bags at 70 yuan. Zaopo did not open. Su Changpo fell from 83 yuan to 77 yuan.

The market for glutinous rice wine continued to be lackluster, so although the market supply was not abundant, the market presented a soft-in-the-air appearance. Yi Li Puyuan opened at 77 yuan, Chang Dan goods at 75-76 yuan, Hong Kong glutinous rice at 75 yuan, down to 72-73 yuan, and glutinous tea at 65 yuan, down to 53-54 yuan.

### Flour Sales Often Hindered

The flour market is not very smooth, because customer sales have been flat recently, and transportation in various places is often hindered, so the customer appetite is not strong. The total market only includes nearly 10,000 bags of retail sales from the Chinese factory to this street. Other transactions are only a few hundred to 1-2,000 bags. The price of foreign flour has increased due to increased war risk insurance and shipping costs. Therefore, sellers are more reluctant to sell. Fushou brand flour is priced at 20 yuan, followed by 19.6-7 yuan. It is heard that several hundred bags were purchased on this street, and the old car return flour still requires 19 yuan, but there is no formal agreement.

The wheat market remained quiet, because arrivals and sales have been slow in recent days. Occasionally, small amounts of wheat from nearby areas are transported, and they are all designated to be sent to Japanese factories, with prices still around 21 yuan. The price of goods transported into the concession is high and cannot be collected, so the market has become tight again.

### Securities: Domestic Debt Flickering; Sometimes Falling Sharply, Sometimes Rising High

The securities unofficial market fluctuated quite rapidly yesterday, rising and falling suddenly, flickering uncertainly. Category C securities were traded in and out around 60 yuan, and the bulls gradually shifted, with obvious signs to be found. Most of them shifted from the hands of large firms to general retail investors, so sometimes they fell sharply, and sometimes they struggled to rise. Prices are too high, and a slight shake can easily lead to a decline. For the time being, the new bulls should be slightly cautious. Yesterday morning, Tungsunhong and Taiyou released large quantities, and the market price suddenly broke through the 60-yuan mark. Then, Lianhe and Lianyi greatly replenished their holdings, and Category C securities were again raised to 60 yuan. After entering the market, Yitai sold out, but Shun Chang and Wuyuan still had an appetite. Retail demand was strong, so the noon closing of Category C securities was stable. In the afternoon, Dingkang and Tongkang bought more than 670,000, and the price increased by two or three jiao. However, Hongda, Tungsun, Xinfu, and Defu sold out in large quantities. Although Yongkang and Yichang and general retail investors bought in, Seventh and Lianhe Hengfu sold more. Therefore, the market price could not be fixed, but it was still above 60 yuan. The closing market price resulted in a slight rebound of 5 fen to 2.5 jiao across the board. The number of transactions was still more than 1.8-9 million yuan. A brief table is listed below:

Category High Low Close Compared to Previous Day

National A 68.70 67.60 68.40 Fell 0.15

National B 65.20 62.50 62.85 Down 0.25

National C 60.65 59.80 60.25 Down 0.25

National D 59.55 59.25 59.45 Down 0.15

National E 60.20 59.60 60.00 Down 0.05

Stock transactions: 45 shares of Zhonghua Book Company were traded, with a price of 33 yuan, slightly higher than the previous price of 1-2 yuan.

The stock market of the Public Industry Association was weak in the morning due to rumors of the withdrawal of British expatriates. Later, due to the eagerness of short covering and new purchases, the rebound was quite rapid. The closing trend was stable again. Not many people were taking profits, and the trading was scarce and the interest was narrow.

London, 22nd (Wednesday report): Today's market prices for Chinese foreign debt and Far East British business companies' stocks are still flat. Although bank stocks showed a slight improvement, HSBC British-registered shares rose by 2 pounds, with a price of 62 pounds. Hong Kong-registered shares were unchanged, and the Bank of Indochina also rose by 2 shillings and 2 pence, with a price of 10 pounds, 7 shillings, and 6 pence. The rest were unchanged.

### Textiles: Cotton Cloth Saw Mixed Price Movements; Hong Kong and Guangdong Agencies Continued to Actively Purchase

Yesterday, the cloth market saw mixed price movements due to the decline in raw yarn and the slight stagnation in actual sales. Prices for each type of goods saw both increases and decreases. For example, among white goods, fine cloth and fine twill fell slightly by 1-2 jiao per bolt, while fine yarn fabrics such as poplin also rose and were very sharp, because the industry's thinking was firm and high, and the street was actively hoarding. Furthermore, Hong Kong and Guangdong agencies continued to purchase colored cloth and colored twill for Zhuma and Shayu Chung without ceasing, and another 500+ pieces were traded yesterday. Dongpi Longtou fine cloth and serge were slightly weak, while mid-range fine cloth and fine twill were still strong. Fine cloth rose again by 5-6 jiao per bolt. 12-pound Flying Fish Trumpet Yanghe and other brands were all sold for 32.2-3 yuan per bolt. The market prices for fine cloth from this factory are as follows:

12-pound Dapeng 35.25

12-pound Baogui 33.00

12-pound Duobin 32.50

On the 23rd, 100 pieces of textiles were shipped to Weihaiwei and 300 pieces were shipped to Yantai. On the 24th, 675 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong.

### Oil Market: Oil Storage Companies Hope for Movement

Yesterday in the oil market, initially in the morning, there was some market support because it was rumored that an agreement had been reached regarding the removal of stored oil, with a fee of four yuan per piece, and that a batch could be released yesterday morning. However, there was no actual confirmation of this. Although some hoarders manipulated futures, the overall situation remained mediocre. Transactions included: 50 pieces of Jiaozhou raw oil, priced at 70 yuan, 7 jiao and 5 fen; 400 pieces for delivery in three to four weeks, priced at 72 yuan, 5 jiao to 7 jiao 5 fen, then falling to 72 yuan 5 jiao; 50 barrels of Qingdao raw oil, priced at 100 yuan and 5 jiao; 100 barrels for delivery in the first ten days of November, priced at 102 yuan to 2 yuan 5 jiao; 400 barrels for delivery in the last ten days of November, priced at 103 yuan to 4 yuan 5 jiao.

### North and South Goods: Assorted New Longans Offered

The first batches of new dried longans, such as those from Quanzhou, Tong'an, and Zhangzhou in Fujian, have arrived in small quantities, totaling three to four hundred dan. These are all goods from established merchants, and the quantity is still not large. Therefore, although there is hope for a price relaxation, it has not been excessive. It is expected to open today.

Yesterday, 1,185 bags of black dates and 500 bags of walnuts arrived from Qingdao.

### Sugar Market: Sugar Trading Quiet

Yesterday in the sugar market, coarse white sugar was relatively soft, while refined white sugar rose slightly, and Dutch red sugar remained flat.

### Assorted Woolen Fabrics

— Fusheng Student

The woolen fabric business is expanding daily. Shanghai, now called an isolated island, is experiencing booming business, better than before the war. The patterns and colors sold change yearly, and some have increased. I will list the seasonal patterns and colors below (details of various pullover woolens are mostly determined individually by each business, establishing their own names, unlike ordinary goods, so they are not widely traded and therefore not recorded).

Serge comes in many varieties, generally named raw and cooked fine plain serge, medium-thick serge, white serge, striped serge, sesame serge, checkered serge, herringbone serge, etc. Broadcloth is available in double-sided and single-sided, in black and two other colors, and there are also white broadcloth and striped patterned broadcloth. Fancy suiting is more complex than serge, including large checks, small checks, medium checks, wide stripes, narrow stripes, large herringbone, fine herringbone, diagonal patterns, box patterns, plain colors, crepe textures, mesh, iridescent colors, and mixed colors. However, they are mostly generally called spring thin fancy suiting, medium-thick fancy suiting, and wool fancy suiting. Water-resistant cloth comes in iridescent, mixed, plain, assorted colors, striped, and checkered varieties. Raincoat fabrics include boiled water, gauze surface, wool surface, elephant hide lining, thin goods, baubelline, patent leather, silk surface, brushed suede, and suede. Twill is also known as crocodile top. Long-haired plush is also known as caramotex or sea dragon. There are also silk-mixed suiting, speckled suiting, bird droppings suiting, corduroy, bamboo joint suiting, durable suiting, wide-fitting suiting, uniform suiting, economic suiting, box pattern suiting, feather yarn suiting, crepe texture suiting, horizontal broadcloth, barre suiting, snowflake suiting, mandarin jacket suiting, trouser material suiting, Xuan Palace suiting, rose suiting, plain thick suiting, embossed suiting, cloud pattern suiting, beaded suiting, silver-mixed suiting, riding breeches suiting, hair suiting, five-color suiting, Polish suiting, overcoat suiting, herringbone suiting, hat suiting, shoe felt, shoe material, flavor suiting, rotten paste suiting, mirror surface suiting, women's color suiting, yellow camel down, sea tiger down, ruler six down, camel down, screw down, mohair down, wool down, rabbit down, purple lamb down, flannel down, short-haired down, fat pickup, concreting, tulle gauze, Han Limeng, Hayes, parry cloth, gabardine, chocolate ding, straight top, satin, Saigon cloth, white mesh, hemp glue cloth, white canvas, white twill, yellow twill, Wan Liding, Melton, Verona, horsehair lining, charcoal lining, French lining, gray soft lining, gray pocket cloth, printed cloth, lining wool, plain light feather yarn, diagonal feather yarn, mercerized feather yarn, horse palm sleeve lining, single-sided fancy suiting, high-striped fancy suiting, white sea order pergola, women's color fancy suiting, women's overcoat suiting, assorted color enterprise suiting, Yuanzhuang fine suiting, Hox root, true camel four scarf, dice tribute suiting, Firehome fourth edition, military uniform yellow suiting, riding pants suiting, all-wool thick suiting, suit fancy suiting, true and false Master Bubble Textiles, etc.

Those that were once popular and sold well but are now outdated and extinct include printed suiting, yellow-green mixed suiting, sun suiting, mercerized striped raincoat fabric, yellow-mixed velvet, long-haired velvet, black-mixed velvet, silver-mixed velvet, leopard skin velvet, sable velvet, and various otter velvets.

### Snail Dwelling Rough Sketches

— Donglin

A snail is born inside its shell, grows inside its shell, and also dies inside its shell. Throughout the process of being born, growing, and dying, it perhaps never comprehends the world outside its shell, because it has its own world, its own space for survival. Can you classify it as being outside the realm of living things? It is born, grows, and dies in the same way as those who are of the "chicken-length" kind. It's just that the space they occupy differs in size.

Due to this almost grotesque thought, I gained a little comfort, because I am currently living inside a snail shell, living almost like a snail. Seeing those towering mansions and foreign-style villas outside, I sometimes can't help but feel a pang of frustration, but when I think of snails, I feel relieved. If snails can survive, how can I not?

I don't intend to write a "Snail Shell Travelogue" or a "Snail Shell Living Report" at this moment, because the noble people must believe in the theory of evolution, and they would definitely not be interested in this snail shell life that has regressed ninety-eight thousand years, let alone take a casual tour. Therefore, I will only write some rough sketches, both as a way to amuse myself, and naturally also as a reference for other snails.

In order to avoid the embarrassing stares from the upper-class gentlemen, and to avoid being too vulgar and hurting their dignity (no, their noble eyes), I think it's better to change it to "snail dwelling." Changing it to "dwelling" should make it more elegant. Aren't there also "dwellings" with such-and-such names inscribed in front of many foreign-style villas? I am not Ah Q, but I would rather be a bit like Ah Q, just this once, with no future repetitions, it's okay.

I had already bought my paper, ink, and writing brush long ago, preparing to write two large characters "Snail Dwelling" in the style of the Cao Quan Stele and hang them on the lintel, but I have been busy making a living all day long, and haven't had time to write them well and hang them up, so there is a blank space in front of the door. As for inside the door, it is an irregularly shaped parallelogram cuboid, extending a large step and a quarter from left to right, and a large step and a sixth from the threshold to the back wall. Because the back wall was short of a few inches of space, the landlord had to make it slanted to avoid violating the "encroachment" laws, so my snail dwelling became an unequal-sided (or rather, forced, the box is stuffed into the gap just enough for the head of the bed, two baskets sleep under the cloth bed, and a pile of books is squeezed onto the self-made wooden bookshelf on the wall, under which is my desk and chair, slightly off-center from the window.

This is what the snail dwelling is like during the day. When I enter the door, my wife has to sit in the chair, and only after I sit on the cloth bed can my wife go out; when my wife comes in, I do the same. What about the little snail? Besides being placed on the bed to sit or lie down, it is taken to the alley. If the three snails are all in the "dwelling," the little snail curls up on the bed, and my wife and I sit separately on the chair and at the table. When the three snails move, either your head touches his chest, or his hand is at an unequal angle) quadrilateral frame. This is the general outline of the surroundings of the snail dwelling, as for under my feet, it is a good ocher-red floor, above my head is someone else's floor, and if my arms were a foot longer, I could reach up and climb.

I have two cloth beds, a box, two baskets, a writing desk, a chair, and a large pile of books. I am the male snail, my wife is the female snail, and there is also a little snail. Counting three snails of various sizes.

A cloth bed (along the bed) leans diagonally against the back wall, already occupying one-third of the snail dwelling, touching your arm.

At night, my wife and the little snail sleep on this bed against the back wall, where do I sleep? I must stretch my head or feet under the table on the floor, which is a bit stuffy, and the folding bed and chair are in the way. After thinking back and forth, I nailed a nail into the back wall and hung the chair on it, so the chair legs dragged down, more than a foot away from my wife and the little snail's bed. My wife's head often bumps into the chair legs when she sits up, but the space freed up by the chair is enough for me to set up another cloth bed. Before setting up the cloth bed, I must close the door of the snail dwelling tightly, because the cloth bed has to be placed across the back of the door. At this time, there is only a gap for one leg between my bed and my wife's bed, enough to grab the chamber pot or stand and fold and unfold the bed. So when I lie down, the snail dwelling is completely formed, because the entire room, except for a thin crack between the two beds, my head is against the table, my feet are against the wall, my wife's head is against the box, her feet are also against the wall, and the chair and wall bookshelf are hanging above. If I could also place something in the air, I would not only be the complete owner of the snail dwelling, but I am afraid I would also be the inventor of "saving space."

The opening and closing of the snail dwelling's door completely depends on my getting up and going to bed, so when friends come to me in the morning and evening, they can never enter.

In this way, hanging chairs, folding beds, and setting up beds, I have spent a year. Just like the people in those high-rise buildings and foreign-style villas, I have spent a year. Due to this snail-dwelling habit, I may have become a bit snail-like. I think it is an unforgivable sin for people to waste space and occupy other people's space.

I don't know if the "living space" in the mouths of Hitler and Mussolini is different from my living space, but I firmly believe that people who waste space must also be people who invade other people's space. I believe that no matter how greedy the invaders are, those who can survive will always have their due space. The invaders will certainly not occupy all the space, and the invaded will never be without a foothold for survival, just like the snail and I have always lived in this world. The only difference between my world and the snail's world is that I firmly believe that space should not be privately owned by anyone, and that there will inevitably be a day when space will still be public. But at that time, it will belong to the world of my and the snail's descendants. I happily look forward to it, yearning for it.

### Transitional Life in a Transitional Era

— Chen Peiying

The biggest difficulty for married women participating in social work is whether their husbands can cooperate, help, and encourage them. If we go to participate in social work, and after the work is completed, they cannot stay at home and go out to do evil, we would rather stay in the kitchen for the rest of our lives, and also ask our husbands to share or help with the household work. Now I am here to report on my half-social, half-family work situation. It can also be said to be a transitional life in a transitional era.

I am a commercial school graduate from a certain girls' school, and I have been married for many years. My husband is a clerk in a foreign firm and also an amateur painter. We have a daughter who is now studying in elementary school. In the morning, my husband and I cooperate on household chores. Sometimes he is very busy with painting, so I am responsible for everything alone. After eight o'clock, the three of us lock the door and leave at the same time, each going to our own office or classroom. We all return for lunch at half past noon, and lunch is cooked by my mother. After five o'clock in the afternoon, we return home one after another. My husband is always the first to arrive home. When he returns home, he brings back groceries to prepare for the big feast of dinner. Our breakfast and lunch are very casual, only dinner is more elaborate. We happily divide the work and cooperate, washing vegetables, rinsing rice, and washing bowls! We are busy and happy. But if he is very busy, then he does not participate in the kitchen work, but this is very rare. Although this life makes us extremely busy, we are very happy in spirit.

In short, for married women to participate in social work, the cooperation of their husbands is necessary. I myself am capable of enduring hardship and hard work, and I also need a reliable person to guard the house and deal with other miscellaneous tasks, otherwise it would just be pie in the sky.

### The Dancer's Destiny

— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter 10 The Shoe Problem

When I asked Jinmei to tell the facts about Li Shouqi, Jinmei still had a small, roundabout performance. She walked to the desk, bent over, and gently pulled up a corner of the perforated curtain with her hand, looking outside, as if this conversation was very secret, fearing that Li Zifan would return and overhear it, causing trouble. Then she returned to the round table, and her face also showed a cautious expression. I pointed to the other leather-cushioned chair, and she slowly sat down.

She said in a low voice: "Sir, this young master Li is indeed a bit suspicious, but I really dare not say. Now that Miss Wang is dead, Mr. Li seems to be the master here. If he knows that I am talking about his son, then I definitely won't be able to handle it. Sir, this matter is too important. If you cannot guarantee me, I still dare not say."

I immediately replied: "Don't worry, just say it. As long as your words are completely true, no one can make things difficult for you. Tell me, what happened with Li Shouqi?"

Jinmei's gaze was fixed on me, paused for a moment, and suddenly said: "He wanted to rape Miss Wang!" After she said this, she hurriedly averted her gaze and moved it to the window, as if very frightened.

This sentence certainly couldn't help but surprise me, but I still maintained a calm demeanor. I replied: "Don't be afraid, even if Li Zifan comes back, it doesn't matter. Tell me in more detail. He came on the seventeenth, what happened after he came?"

Jinmei calmed herself down and said, "As soon as he arrived here, Miss Wang saw him, and everyone's faces looked bad. After he had lunch, Miss Wang talked with him here. The voice of the conversation was very low, and the time was very long. I once brought tea in, and Miss Wang immediately told me to go out and locked the door. So I didn't hear anything about what they talked about. Later, that person surnamed Zhao came, and Miss Wang hurriedly rushed out to stop him, not letting the person surnamed Zhao come in.

"They talked for a full two hours, and everyone's throats were hoarse. Fortunately, Mr. Li knocked on the door and came in to persuade them. Mr. Li also joined the conversation, and they talked for a long time before Miss Wang angrily opened the door and went upstairs." (145)

### Precious Fragments of the Chrysanthemum Stage

(18)

Since Mei Lanfang retired to Hong Kong, Shang Xiaoyun's fame and fortune in the Liyuan world of the old capital have almost surpassed those of Cheng Yanqiu and Xun Huisheng. Both Mei and Cheng had organized troupes to conquer overseas lands. Before the war, Xiaoyun had repeatedly and earnestly requested a certain important figure in the old capital to find a way to follow in the footsteps of Mei and Cheng to travel abroad. Not long after, the war broke out, and it was abandoned. Therefore, Xiaoyun privately talked to people, often citing the failure of this event as a regret. Now, the news has come that Xiaoyun has decided to travel to the East to perform next month! "Where there is a will, there is a way!" For Shang, his wish has been fulfilled, but an old clown, upon learning of this, said with sigh: "It's not the right time, it's not the right time!"

(19)

Xun Lingxiang, one of the five famous young dan performers, is very diligent. In addition to seeking advice from the old master Wang Yaoqing, he has also learned a good hand at flower painting, and he is also quite well-known in the art world of the old capital. The painting teacher is the famous painter Liu Xiyong from the old capital. People say, "Huisheng has a successor."

(20)

Yan Jupeng is full of complaints. A few years ago, someone said to him: "Now it's popular to do things recklessly. If you perform a few operas tomorrow, you might catch up with Xi Cailian"? At that time, Xi Cailian had just arrived in Peking and was singing very popularly. Jupeng smiled silently after hearing this and said, "I will change my name to Yan Cailian tomorrow." Then, he jokingly quipped: "People spin cotton, I pick up waste paper, and then I will change it to picking up light bulbs. Actually, when I perform female roles, how small you look at the beginning, but it becomes pleasing to the eye when you look closely!"

(21)

Zhu Qinxin is good at spending money. One year in Tianjin, during the sweltering summer heat, a certain fruit store had just transported several American cantaloupes by plane from the sea. Zhu bought one for more than twelve yuan, and while eating, she said, "The taste is not much different from the ones here." Before she could eat even half of it, she threw it away casually.

Before Hao Shouchang retired, he often liked to cross-dress, and the roles he played were always graceful female characters. In 1924, Xu Biyun and Tan Fuying cross-dressed in Wax Temple in the old capital's Huale. Hao Shouchang and Ma Liankun, two Jing actors, simultaneously played Xiao Zhang Ma and Zhang Guilan. When Xiao Zhang Ma removed Zhang Guilan's veil, Hao said in a Sanhe dialect: "Oh! I thought it was who? Turns out it's also a painted face." The audience burst into thunderous applause.

### "Princess Iron Fan" to Be Completed Soon

— A Han

Will Film "Locusts and Ants" Again

Since Walt Disney's "Snow White" was introduced to our country, the general audience who love cartoon films have undoubtedly expressed a deeper appreciation. Indeed, if we believe that movies can educate society, then cartoon films are indeed very effective in this regard, especially among women and children.

Our country has paid little attention to cartoon films due to insufficient equipment, so the Wan brothers (Laiming and Guchan) have worked hard on cartoon work for more than ten years, but they have still failed to attract the interest of the general public. Until the spring of this year, the Guolian Film Company established a cartoon department. The authorities had long admired their reputation, so they hired them to preside over the direction of the project. Therefore, China's first full-length cartoon "Princess Iron Fan" began filming under their plan.

Now, after working for more than four months, it is almost entirely successful. After two months of dubbing, editing, and various necessary processes, it can begin to be presented to the audience. Of course, it will definitely be warmly supported by thousands of people.

In "Princess Iron Fan," although the title seems to contain elements of gods and monsters, the content is very much aimed at the great era, explaining that before the pursuit of light, one must go through untold hardships. Therefore, in the second film, the theme will be greatly enriched. At present, the working title is "Locusts and Ants," including the survival dynamics of all animals in the universe, but the problem to be considered is how to incorporate the meaning of the times.

### Shirley Temple Stars in "The Blue Bird"

— Ana

"The Blue Bird" is the lifelong immortal masterpiece of the Belgian literary giant Maurice Maeterlinck. The translation has spread all over the world, recited by hundreds of millions of people. Its rich interest, rich imagination, profound meaning, and tight structure make it worthy of being the most moving fairy tale in the world. Before Shirley Temple left the screen, Fox Company specially spent a huge sum of money to solemnly film it, with Temple playing the protagonist Mytyl in the film, and with famous actors such as Schell Bercuson co-starring. The huge scenes in the film are extremely magical and gorgeous, and the entire film is filmed in five colors, which is truly dazzling. No wonder, when it was screened in the United States, general public opinion held that its artistic achievements far surpassed "Snow White." It is indeed a good film worthy of appreciation this week. The attached picture is a scene from the film, which will be shown at the Great Light Theater starting Thursday.

### Liu Qiong to Play Zheng Chenggong Again

— Ling Bai

In Lafayette's "Mother Goner"

Liu Qiong is undoubtedly the leading young actor in the film industry today. At the same time, he is also a strong general in the stage drama world. I remember last winter, the Shanghai Drama Society performed "Remnants of the Late Ming Dynasty" (which is Wei Ruhui's "Flowers of Loyalty" in this newspaper's Spring and Autumn section). He was the lead actor Zheng Chenggong, because the character in the play is full of慷慨激昂 and impassioned spirit, which formally matches his personality, so he immediately won the unanimous praise of thousands of audiences.

Under the principle of disaster relief, the New Arts Society's drama performance of "Zheng Chenggong, Hero of the Seas" was for one week, and the lead role in the play was still invited to him. Of course, under his rough style, the acting was also very successful.

October is called the historical drama season. Therefore, after "The Biography of the Righteous Martyrs of the Great Ming Dynasty", the Drama Society plans to perform last year's great work "Remnants of the Late Ming Dynasty". The lineup is quite strong. Among them, because Liu Qiong's Zheng Chenggong had made a deep impression on people in last year's performance, the society still welcomed his participation. Of course, under the condition of taking art as the premise, he did not feel tired because he had already performed "Hero of the Seas" for a week, but was very excited and resolutely took on the role. Yes, after the military performance of "Remnants of the Late Ming Dynasty", the entire drama world will once again cause a sensation.

### Twenty Kinds of Yue Opera

— Dongyun Writes, Xiuyan Illustrates

(7) Great Tang Recognizes Wife

There is a play in Peking Opera called "The Three Courts Joint Trial", in which the female prisoner below the steps is the judge's lover from many years ago. Now this play, "Great Tang Recognizes Wife", is equally coincidental; the female prisoner below the steps is the judge's bedfellow.

What is truly a coincidence is that both of these judges who made a joke in the hall share the same surname, Wang, and their given names also happen to have the character "Long"; one is called Wang Jinlong, and the other is called Wang Wenlong. No wonder the two confused gentlemen mistook Wang Wenlong for Wang Jinlong's older brother (Wang Wenlong is performed by an old man, while Wang Jinlong is a young man), and said that they were "brothers in distress", a laugh. (See picture)

(8) Book of Mutual Scolding

"Book of Mutual Scolding" is performed purely in a comedic form, with two "scolding street" "shrews" competing with each other on stage. "Mutual scolding" is a woman's masterpiece. The characters appearing in the play are "Girl Nine Pounds" and "Aunt Three Pounds." The art of "mutual scolding" is very advanced, with sharp words and no one yielding. "Mutual scolding" seems to be a very annoying thing; however, the charming women of Yue occasionally perform it, not only is it not annoying, but it turns out to be a clever and moving tongue.
