### Rumor of Secret Agreement Between China and Britain Officially Denied by Both Countries; Britain Adopts Parallel Policy with the United States to Secure the Far East; Guo Taiqi Makes Smooth Progress in Negotiations in London

Chongqing - Today, the National Government and the British Embassy have strongly denied the rumor spread by the Japanese side that British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr is currently negotiating a secret military agreement with the Chinese government. According to the British Embassy, there is no such development under consideration. The spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated after confirming that this news was groundless that no such negotiations had been conducted between the Chinese authorities and the diplomatic representatives of the British government. (Reuters dispatch, 9th)

Chongqing - A certain Japanese news agency has issued a message stating that China and Britain are currently negotiating a secret military agreement, which informed sources in China believe to be absurd. The British Embassy here has firmly denied it, and the Chinese government will also issue a formal statement denying it. (Havas dispatch, 9th)

London - There are now various indications that Britain is adopting a parallel policy with the United States to secure the Far East. Recently, an understanding has been reached in principle on the issue of British aid to China, but the amount of this substantial loan is still under negotiation. However, it is rumored that the total amount is roughly the same as the US loan to China. In recent days, Chinese Ambassador to Britain Guo Taiqi has been in frequent contact with British Foreign Secretary Halifax, Under-Secretary of State Butler, and Lord Privy Seal Attlee, all of whom are discussing the general situation in the Far East and how Britain can provide financial and material assistance to China to the greatest extent possible. The scope of the discussion can be roughly divided into several points: (1) Allocating special funds as a reserve fund for Chinese legal tender; (2) Following the precedent of the Anglo-Turkish and Anglo-Portuguese agreements, increasing credit loans for China to purchase goods in the UK, British dominions, and the Sterling bloc countries. The relevant parties have systematically studied the above two points and made smooth progress. People in London are satisfied with the progress of the negotiations, because the treaty indicates that Japan is prepared to assist the Axis powers and strike against Britain. Under the fierce air raids and the threat of aggression by German aircraft, Britain cannot be deceived by Japan again, saying that Japan's membership is not directed against Britain, and ignoring the importance of Japan's membership. Now that China has obtained substantial assistance from the United States and the Soviet Union will never change its policy towards China, the situation in the Sino-Japanese war will soon change. Conversely, the European countries allied with the United States are too far from the Far East and cannot provide financial or military assistance to each other. After three years of attrition warfare, China's strength has been increasing, and assistance to China has been increasing. In contrast, it is not difficult to predict the future of the Sino-Japanese war. (Dispatch, 8th)

### Central Memorial Week; He Yingqin Reports; Recent Military Victory in Northern Hubei of Great Significance; Japanese Attempt Has Been Crushed

Chongqing - At the Central Memorial Week this morning, He Yingqin reported on the recent military situation in Northern Hubei, stating that the Japanese army's war of aggression against China has now become bogged down and has no spare capacity to launch any offensive. However, the so-called Japan-Thailand treaty is nothing more than a piece of waste paper, and it is attempting to seek a decisive victory militarily. Troops were drawn from various places to launch an offensive in the Xiang River basin. From the 23rd of last month, the Japanese army on both sides of the Xiang River began to act. One unit of the Japanese army on the east bank advanced from Jingxi River and other places towards Lishan, while another unit advanced from Zhongxiang towards Changshoudian and other places on the western foothills of Dahong Mountain. The Japanese army on the west bank joined with the Japanese army from Zhongxiang and other places on the east bank and advanced northwards from the line of Dangyang Yuxi River Jingmen. With land and air coordination, the momentum was very fierce. The Chinese army waited at ease and dealt them a heavy blow. On the 28th, all routes were reported to have collapsed. The Chinese army took advantage of the victory to pursue the enemy, recapturing cities, towns, and villages such as Shidian, Jingmingpu, Chuohualing, Shushan, Jinjiling, Anju, Junchuan, Hejiadian, Tangjiawan Jiulishan, Taerwan, Huantan, Zhangjiaji, Majiaji, and Changxundian on the east bank, directly approaching the vicinity of Zhongxiang County; and recapturing Kuaihuopu, Lijiadang, Xianju, Zengjiawan, Lixi, and Chi Miao and other places on the west bank, advancing to the outskirts of Jingmen. By the 1st of this month, all the Japanese forces in various places had been cleared. In total, more than 20,000 Japanese soldiers, including the Japanese Kawasaka Brigade Commander, were killed in this campaign, creating the largest recent victory in that area. The Japanese army's so-called winter offensive has been completely crushed. Analyzing the Japanese army's attempt to launch this offensive, there are no more than the following three intentions: (1) To echo the recognition of the puppet regime organization, indicating that it still has the ability to continue its offensive; (2) To侥倖 defeat the field army of the [unclear] group, thereby taking Xiangfan and threatening [unclear]; (3) If it cannot defeat the Chinese field army, but can make slight advances, it can also claim victory and reduce the side threat to Yisha. However, the result was the opposite. Not only did the Japanese fail to achieve all their goals, but they suffered great losses. On the one hand, the Chinese army took only seven days to completely repel the invading Japanese army in this battle. Its significance is extremely important. First, it keeps the Japanese army that broke into Yisha still under the side control of China, with no room for development, and not only cannot threaten [unclear], but the Chinese army can also take advantage of the situation at any time. Second, the Chinese army's victory this time can not only make the international community understand that Japan is powerless, but also directly affect the psychology of the Japanese military and civilians. In short, since the victory of this battle, the fact that the Japanese army is getting weaker and weaker and the Chinese army is getting stronger and stronger has become an unbreakable truth. Our whole country should follow the instructions of the President, obey the national policy, and work together to fight hard. I believe that the ultimate victory will certainly come as the President expects (earlier). (Dispatch, 9th)

### Fierce Fighting Reported on the Thai-Vietnamese Border; Thai Planes Bomb Savannakhet; Five Divisions of Chinese Troops Concentrated on the Guangxi Border

Hanoi - Today, it is reported that fierce fighting has broken out in the northern part of Laos Province. French and Thai troops have been exchanging heavy fire with machine guns and aircraft on their respective border outposts. French officials strongly stated that they are very willing to negotiate and that this conflict will not affect the peaceful resolution of the dispute, but also stated that they cannot tolerate any attacks and will retaliate. The Thais, on the other hand, are increasingly complacent. Official reports state that on Sunday morning, the Thai army unjustifiably fired machine guns at our army on the banks of the Mekong River, and our army returned fire. There were no casualties on our side. Shooting broke out again at 10:00 am. In the afternoon, Thai planes flew into Vietnamese territory without dropping bombs. At 5:00 pm, one fighter plane and three light bombers dropped ten bombs on Vietnam, injuring one civilian, burning down one house, and destroying two thatched huts. The French authorities have been patient and willing to negotiate for the past three months, but they cannot tolerate this matter, so this morning French planes also dropped twelve bombs on Lakon in Thai territory. Furthermore, authoritative sources said tonight that Thai planes dropped seven bombs on Savannakhet at 10:40 am this morning, causing only material damage and no casualties. In addition, authoritative Chinese sources stated that five Chinese divisions, equipped with heavy artillery, have been concentrated on the Guangxi border. Travelers confirmed this information, saying that the number of Chinese troops is increasing daily. Chinese sources also mocked that the concentration of Chinese troops is the result of the recent Sino-British agreement, designed to prevent the Japanese from advancing south again.

New York - Thai Foreign Ministry Special Advisor Duller Bar recently stated that if the Thai-Vietnamese situation continues to be tense and leads to war, then there is a danger that Japan will profit from it. If Thailand attacks Vietnam, the Vietnamese natives will inevitably rise up in revolution and resist the French. Under this circumstance, Japan will inevitably use the excuse of maintaining order and occupy Vietnam. Then the real danger will arrive. (United Press dispatch, 9th)

Bangkok - Thai Prime Minister Songgram spoke at the closing of the National Assembly yesterday, saying that the situation in Thailand and Vietnam is quite tense, but not serious. Thailand's financial and economic situation is quite satisfactory, and its relations with other countries are also good. However, France does not yet understand Thailand's intentions. The Prime Minister asked the delegates to convey to their respective districts that the situation in the country is not serious, but the government will never allow France to infringe upon the sovereignty of the country.

Editorial

### Society's View of the Municipal Council and Chinese Police

"If the public wants to obtain full and effective police protection, then it should be prepared to pay those who risk their lives to maintain peace and order," it is said that this was the explanation given by the responsible official of the Police Department after the Shanghai Public Concession Municipal Council approved a 150% increase in the treatment of Chinese police officers in the concession, fearing that the taxpayers' burden would increase dramatically. Therefore, the public should not misunderstand this, thinking that the police officers regard the so-called protection as a commodity and sell it to the public at a price, and that better protection will be regarded as a higher commodity, demanding a greater price from the public; nor should there be any doubt, thinking that the protection received in the past has already been commensurate with the price paid in the past, and that the perceived lack of protection is due to the excessively low price. The public must distinguish three points: first, paying a certain price to get a certain amount of protection is a general principle between the public and the administration, which is fair and unassailable; if it is heard in the political classroom, it will also be happily accepted by the students; justice is where it is, regardless of who says it. Second, taking Shanghai as an example, the taxpayers are the ones who pay the price, and the Municipal Council is the one who is responsible; whether the taxpayers are satisfied or not with the protection they receive, whether the price they pay is too high or not, whether the price and the protection are commensurate or not, this must be resolved between the taxpayers and the Municipal Council, the problem is not with the police authorities. Third, the police authorities, in their capacity as public servants and in the spirit of public service, must not care about the price paid by the public and must strive to exert their highest and best abilities; the public can only judge based on their actual performance, proving that they have the power to achieve full and effective results. As for increasing the treatment of Chinese police officers, one reason is that prices have soared and the original salary is absolutely insufficient to maintain a living; another reason is that within the same organization, the treatment of Chinese police officers is uniquely meager, sharing the same dangers but not sharing the same joys and sorrows, which violates justice and administrative principles; increasing the treatment of Chinese police officers is based on these two extremely serious reasons, but has nothing to do with the so-called "if you want a certain amount of protection, you must pay a certain price." Recognizing these limits and boundaries, we can begin to discuss the matter on its own merits. Let us say a few more words.

The current issue: After the Chinese police officers' treatment has been increased, it is said that the Municipal Council's monthly expenditure has increased by 700,000 yuan, which is a very large amount and has become a problem in itself. Considering that the Municipal Council increased various tax rates starting in the autumn of this year, i.e., July, taking the house tax as an example, the autumn receipts totaled 5.92 million yuan, an increase of 2.9 million yuan compared to the 3.02 million yuan in the autumn of last year, i.e., a monthly increase of 967,000 yuan; other tax receipts are not included. We cannot simply say that this is enough to cover the increased salaries of the Chinese police officers. However, it must be said that the burden on the citizens is already heavy. It is the inescapable duty of the citizens to bear the municipal expenses, but it is necessary to review the achievements of the Municipal Council at the same time. Let us take one example: within the concession, i.e., under the jurisdiction of the Municipal Council, how many residents are there, how much food is stored, how much is imported each month, what is the cost price each time, and what percentage of the stock is held by rice merchants and hoarders? The high price of rice is now the main reason for the high price of everything, and the high price of everything is also the main reason for threatening the security of the concession; what measures has the Municipal Council taken to address this situation, and what results have been achieved? If you say that there is manipulation and monopoly, why allow manipulation and monopoly? If you say that is not the case, why is rice so expensive? We believe that whether it is indulging rice weevils and rice villains, or watching legitimate merchants being falsely accused of being weevils and villains, or even the high price of rice or the lack of grain, the Municipal Council has been too inactive! What do the citizens feel? They only feel that petty offenses are not allowed, but open extortion is allowed, binding the citizens' mouths and stomachs, and forcing them to redeem them in small amounts! The burden on the citizens is already heavy, and what they encounter and feel is like this, how can we not hope that the Municipal Council will do better?

Another current issue: After improving the treatment of Chinese police officers, the overall goal is to launch a welfare campaign for Chinese police officers. Undoubtedly, this campaign is worth advocating, and we hope that all [unclear] will work together to make it a success. The scope of welfare for police officers is quite broad, and we have not yet had the opportunity to learn what is planned to be launched. But generally speaking, in addition to the various necessary equipment and measures that the police authorities must provide for their personnel, society, for the welfare of Chinese police officers and also for the welfare of the citizens, should focus on Shanghai's situation and make great efforts from the sidelines: first, regarding the organization of consumer cooperatives, it is still difficult to expect Chinese police officers to adopt cooperative methods consciously and spontaneously; how should all parties in society provide assistance in terms of material resources and intelligence; and various industries related to Chinese police officers' consumption should each provide convenience to the Chinese police officers' cooperative organizations. Second, regarding spiritual assistance; this does not mean recruiting Chinese police officers to attend lectures in addition to receiving training from the police department and working hard, but focusing on their spare time, choosing what is necessary, and providing opportunities for them to automatically absorb the spirit of progress under various relaxed and reasonable methods, in order to directly relieve their depression and confusion. Indirectly emphasize their service functions. Third, regarding the promotion of social awards: the police department has its own reward and punishment regulations, which outsiders do not want to hear about; however, there are also those who sacrifice or are injured for public service, and the compensation received from the police department is not enough to compensate for their losses; how should society establish methods, give preferential awards, and ensure that Chinese police officers who work hard to serve the public will receive superior comfort in terms of reputation and full protection in terms of economy in case of any accident; this is to extend social justice, express social sympathy, and also to improve their belief in serving the public. The realization of these three points, I believe, will enable the Chinese police officers to truly enjoy their welfare, and what they create for society will be considerable!

### Matsuoka Delivers a Speech: Hopes for Understanding Between the US and Japan; Japan Will Not Participate If Germany Attacks the US; Refuses to Discuss Relations with the Soviet Union

Tokyo: Foreign Minister Matsuoka, since taking office in July, received foreign press reporters today for the first time. He stated that war between the US and Japan would be extremely foolish. Even if both the US and Germany were simultaneously involved in a war, the question of who the aggressor is and whether Japan has obligations under Article 3 of the Tripartite Pact would arise. Japan has no territorial ambitions anywhere in East Asia. Japan's ultimate goal for the Dutch East Indies is genuine understanding. Regarding Japanese-Soviet negotiations, he hopes to persuade Moscow to acknowledge that recognizing the Nanjing regime will not harm Japanese-Soviet relations. If Germany attacks the US, Article 3 of the Tripartite Pact will not be implemented. If the situation falls within the scope of the treaty, each signatory should make independent judgments and then discuss the matter together. He hopes this situation will not occur. A reporter asked for his opinion on the future relations between the US and Japan. Matsuoka replied that although they may have different opinions, as everyone knows, there is no reason for war if they do not infringe upon each other. He hopes that the US and Japan will have the best possible understanding in the near future. Matsuoka refused to discuss the progress of negotiations between Japanese Ambassador Tatekawa and the Soviet authorities in Moscow, but stated that the Tripartite Pact is completely unrelated to the Soviet Union. Japan's ultimate goal is to establish genuine understanding with the Dutch East Indies, Thailand, Burma, Malaya, etc. Someone asked if Mr. Arita's current state of Pacific defense remains unchanged. Matsuoka replied that maintaining the status quo is almost impossible in today's rapidly changing world. Japan has no intention of hindering change. Matsuoka also said that the possibility of US warships using Singapore as a base would be an immediate concern for Japan, but there is no evidence of this happening at present. The Nanjing treaty does not close the door to reconciliation with Chongqing, but this peace is already somewhat distant. Any contact with Chongqing has been left to Nanjing to handle. US loans to Chongqing prolong the conflict and are regrettable, but Japan has no reason to change its China policy to please the US because it believes that what it is doing is right. Matsuoka reiterated that Japan's war is not to oppress China, and that if it were, he himself would oppose it. Although there may still be misunderstandings overseas, he believes that the legitimacy of Japan's war will soon be proven. Currently, there is an effort in Japan to oppose the West's conquest, greed, oppression, and exploitation of weak nations. If the US understands that Japan opposes such tactics, all disputes will naturally be resolved. Matsuoka finally asked if anyone could tell him whether the US would participate in the war, saying that it was a major question because the fate of humanity depended on it. (Reuters, 9th)

Tokyo: Today, the Japan National Newspaper stated that the US is the only country hindering Japan from building a new order in Asia. The US's anti-Japanese attitude is becoming increasingly apparent. A strong public opinion is gradually emerging in Japan, demanding a firm attitude towards the US. It also stated that US public opinion has failed to value Japan's dispatch of Nomura as ambassador to improve US-Japan relations. Furthermore, the Hochi Shimbun advocated for the rapid adjustment of Soviet-Japanese relations to offset the anti-Japanese tactics of Britain and the US. (Associated Press, 9th)

### German Freighter Sunk Off the Southern Coast of Cuba; The German Ship "Kannenberg" Said To Have Been Attacked and Destroyed by British Ship

Havana: According to news arriving here this morning, a German freighter, the "Idarwald," attempted to break through the British blockade line yesterday and was unfortunately sunk by a British warship with torpedoes and shells within the Pan-American neutrality zone off the southern coast of Cuba. The "Idarwald" and another German freighter, the "Rhein," left Tampico together ten days ago. Both ships attempted to pass through the Caribbean Sea between Cuba and Jamaica and were overtaken by a British warship at that time, seemingly a cruiser. Cuban warships searched the sea last night, attempting to find the British warship and any survivors. Only fragmented information is available regarding this matter, and details are not yet known. Two Cuban warships, departing from the Cuban naval base, seemed to have witnessed part of the naval battle. The two ships received a distress signal from the German freighter, stating that its sailors were abandoning the ship. (International News Agency, 9th)

Washington: A US neutrality patrol destroyer, after patrolling, informed the Navy Department that a German freighter, the "Idarwald," was intercepted by a British cruiser off the southern coast of Cuba this morning. It is reported that the German ship's sailors intended to scuttle the ship, but the plan was not completed. Sailors from the British cruiser boarded the German ship. It is said that the British cruiser requested the assistance of the US patrol destroyer. It was not revealed whether the "Idarwald" was bombarded or hit by a torpedo. (International News Agency, 9th)

Buenos Aires: According to an unconfirmed report from the Crítica's correspondent in Montevideo, a German cruiser, which reportedly destroyed the British auxiliary cruiser "Carnarvon Castle" in a naval battle off the coast of Brazil on Saturday, was chased by the British cruiser "Enterprise" yesterday. The same report stated that the "Enterprise" engaged the German ship in the Atlantic and destroyed it. Further details are unknown. The news of this alleged naval battle has not been confirmed as of today. (International News Agency, 9th)

Montevideo: The British auxiliary cruiser "Carnarvon Castle" has had its stay here extended to 72 hours. The Uruguayan government's decision to extend the deadline was based on the report of the technical committee, which proved that the ship had been hit by 22 shells, the engine room was partially destroyed, and the kitchen was completely destroyed. The ship carries sailors from the auxiliary cruiser "Queen of Bermuda," who will likely fill the ship's vacancies. Hundreds of workers are currently repairing the ship, preparing it to be stationed in the Falkland Islands. A full inspection will be carried out. (Haitong News Agency, 9th)

Montevideo: Locals speculate that the German envoy will visit the Uruguayan Foreign Minister to state that, according to the convention of international law, prisoners on warships of belligerent countries are expected to regain their freedom when they arrive at neutral ports. Therefore, since the British auxiliary cruiser "Carnarvon Castle" is now berthed in a neutral port, the Uruguayan government may negotiate with the British warship to release the 22 German prisoners on board. (Haitong News Agency, 9th)

### Ships Attacked in the Atlantic; US Receives Distress Signals

### Japanese Government Decides to Improve Harbors; Tokyo as a Commercial Port

Tokyo: It has been learned today that after a meeting of officials from the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Home Affairs, Ministry of Railways, and Ministry of Communications, the government has tentatively decided to use Tokyo as a commercial port based on the harbor improvement plan passed by the Ministry of Home Affairs' harbor engineers on November 18. If there are no obstacles, the cabinet will formally decide on the details of this plan within this week. It is heard that the government is handling this matter very cautiously to ensure that Yokohama's prosperity is not hindered as a result, as the people of Yokohama strongly oppose it. The government has indicated its approach as follows: (1) Tokyo is not an independent port but an extension of the Yokohama port to Tokyo; (2) Foreign ships can sail into Yokohama; (3) Japanese ships can enter both Yokohama and Tokyo. It is also heard that foreign trade will use Yokohama as a port, while Tokyo will serve the trade of Japan's affiliated countries. At the same time, the Yokohama City Council convened a meeting on December 7 and passed a resolution opposing the opening of Tokyo as a commercial port. Yesterday, a citizens' meeting was convened, attended by 2,000 representatives from various groups, passing a resolution denouncing the government's plan, pointing out that the government's move will make it impossible for Yokohama's million people to make a living. The issue of Tokyo's commercial port has been delayed since 1932 due to Yokohama's opposition. (Reuters, 9th)

### Hungary and Yugoslavia to Conclude a Treaty of Friendship; Hungarian Foreign Minister to Visit Belgrade

Belgrade: Regarding the relations between Hungary and Yugoslavia, official sources here have recently commented that Hungarian Foreign Minister Csáky is scheduled to visit here on the 11th and 12th of this month to meet with Yugoslav authorities. It is expected that a treaty of friendship between the two countries will be signed at that time, the content of which will be no different from that signed by Yugoslavia with Bulgaria in 1937. Responsible figures say that Hungary's accession to the Tripartite Pact with Germany, Italy, and Japan last month, coupled with its treaty with Yugoslavia, has implications that extend beyond the current relationship between the two countries. In short, Yugoslavia seems to be indirectly approaching the Axis powers. For this reason, the restoration of friendship between Hungary and Yugoslavia is nothing less than the beginning of a new diplomatic initiative by Germany in Southeast Europe, the ultimate goal of which remains to promote the accession of all Balkan countries to the "New European Order." Once Yugoslavia recognizes the status quo in Europe created by the current European war, Germany will presumably offer a promise to guarantee Yugoslavia's territorial integrity in order to conclude the first step of this new diplomatic initiative. As for Yugoslavia, it seems to have a clear plan for joining the "New European Order," as can be seen from the speech delivered by Yugoslav Prime Minister Cvetković yesterday. (Havas, 8th)

### German Aircraft in Batches Attack England Overnight; London Suffers Unprecedented Devastation; Various Bombs Dropped, Fires Rage Everywhere; Heavy Material Damage, Deaths, and Injuries

London: Last night and this morning, London was shaken by the most intense air raid since the start of the war. German aircraft flying at low altitude dropped large numbers of incendiary and explosive bombs in batches towards the center of London and its four suburbs, like a rushing torrent. This offensive, comparable to the Coventry air raid, was apparently intended to retaliate for the British Air Force's attacks on Düsseldorf, Brest, and other German cities on Saturday night. As dusk approached, German Air Force giant aircraft, after ending their 44-hour silence, continuously and fiercely pounced on London in batches. At the same time, British anti-aircraft guns roared non-stop, and British Air Force fighters also assisted the anti-aircraft gun teams in the skies over London, engaging the invaders. German aircraft blindly bombed the entire city, and buildings and houses were destroyed. London citizens, having fallen into a false sense of security due to the long period without air raids, were suddenly attacked by the German Air Force in the streets. It is feared that there will be many deaths and injuries. Many large hotels and apartments were directly hit by bombs and destroyed, and most of the construction work already in progress was also damaged. With the help of flares and a bright half-moon, the German Air Force dropped various types of bombs, including new "Molotov breadbasket" explosives, which scattered bombs upon impact, like Chinese firecrackers. This weapon was first used by the Soviet army in the Soviet-Finnish War. International News Agency reporters Smith and Mueller almost lost their lives on the way to the agency. They tried to dodge in street corners all the way, when a violent explosion came, knocking them to the ground. A bomb landed next to them (in the place where they had taken shelter a few minutes ago). Many newspaper buildings and their equipment on Fleet Street were destroyed by bombs. The German Air Force's offensive seemed to slacken slightly at midnight because fierce anti-aircraft fire had driven the invaders away from their targets. German giant cannons on the French coast also bombarded the Dover coastal area. (International News Agency, 9th)

Berlin: This afternoon, the German military communique stated that German aircraft bombed London continuously from dusk to dawn the previous night. London's main warehouses were heavily bombed. Many of the most important bombs were dropped, causing large fires in several places. Gasoline pools caught fire, and a gas plant exploded. Last night, British aircraft invaded German territory. Houses in Düsseldorf, Mönchengladbach, and other places were hit by bombs and caught fire. Nine civilians were killed, seventeen were seriously injured, and twenty-four were slightly injured, but military facilities were undamaged. German anti-aircraft guns shot down two British aircraft, and one German aircraft went missing. (Haitong News Agency, 9th)

Berlin: A Haitong News Agency reporter learned from responsible sources that German aircraft dropped no less than 700 tons of bombs and 80,000-90,000 incendiary bombs while bombing London last night and this morning, setting an unprecedented record. The previous night with the most bombs dropped was 503 tons. (Haitong News Agency, 9th)

London: Last night, the German Air Force again concentrated its efforts on air raids on London. Anti-aircraft guns fired fiercely, and two German aircraft were reportedly hit and destroyed. Fires broke out in many places, and buildings were damaged considerably. There were some casualties among residents. Bombs also landed in many places between London and the southeast coast, causing some damage to houses and other property. (Reuters, 9th)

London: The day and night before and yesterday, no enemy aircraft were seen in London. This was the longest period of tranquility that London citizens had experienced since the German side launched its aerial blitzkrieg on August 7. The alert was only issued again when dusk fell last night. The Ministry of Aviation issued the simplest communique, stating that a German fighter-bomber was shot down in the English Channel yesterday afternoon, and there was nothing else to report. According to midnight news, German aircraft were rampaging again last night, concentrating their attacks on London. Enemy bombers sometimes came individually and sometimes in teams of three or four, flying to various districts of London. High-explosive bombs were dropped. Enemy aircraft first released flares in circles in a certain area and then dropped bombs inside the circles. So far, there have been no reports of significant casualties. (Reuters, 9th)

### British Air Force Night Raids Western Germany; Bombs Dropped in the Rhine Area; Also Bombs Coastal Ports in France

Berlin: This morning, Haitong News Agency learned from responsible authorities that many British aircraft attempted to intrude into western Germany last night, but were driven back by the fierce German anti-aircraft fire. British aircraft dropped many bombs on the west bank of the Rhine, but most of them missed the target. German anti-aircraft guns shot down one British aircraft. (Haitong News Agency, 9th)

London: Officials announced last night the circumstances of the British aircraft's attack on the French Atlantic coast ports of Brest and Lorient when the German Air Force rested on Saturday night.

A British aircraft spotter said that Brest looked like a furnace when it was attacked, with thick smoke and rubble flying everywhere, and the infantry and naval barracks and the buildings between the two barracks were hit by incendiary and high-explosive bombs. (Reuters, 9th)

### British and German Air Force Losses in a Week; Ratio is One to Three

During this period, the scope of German air raids has decreased slightly, but 26 aircraft were still shot down, while only eight British aircraft were destroyed. (Reuters, 9th)

### French Colonial Soldiers Should Rise Up and Defeat the Italian Army; The Opportunity to Win in the Mediterranean is Ripe; General de Gaulle Broadcasts from London

London: General de Gaulle, the leader of the Free French Forces, broadcasted last night to the French forces in Syria and North Africa, urging the French army and navy in North Africa and Syria not to lose the opportunity to strike the exhausted Italian army and completely defeat them, so as to win the opportunity for France to win in the Mediterranean. He said that all generals, soldiers, and officers of the army, navy, and air force in French colonies should unite with the Free French Forces and continue to fight together with the Allies to seek the liberation of France. The current situation has given the French army an excellent opportunity to rejoin the war and win the final victory. France is now secretly plotting to unite again to resist the enemy and refuses to cooperate with Germany. Soon several more French warships will enter the service of the Free French Navy. General de Gaulle recently inspected these French warships, destroyers, submarines, mine-laying ships, and patrol boats at a naval base in the UK. General de Gaulle also inspected a training ship, which is now serving as a Free French Navy Academy to train naval officers. Mr. de Gaulle expressed satisfaction with the work that the Free French Navy is currently engaged in and the morale of its officers and soldiers, and congratulated Vice Admiral Muselier, the commander of the Free French Navy.

### Greek Forces Continue to Achieve Significant Victories, Occupy Argyrokastron, Pursue and Attack Routed Italian Troops, and Expect to Capture Argirokastro Soon

Athens: The Greek High Command officially announced yesterday the complete capture of Argyrokastron, a major stronghold in Albania. The town was the main target of the Greek forces after the fall of Korçë. It is said that the lower part of Albania is now entirely under the control of the Greek forces. On the northern front, the Greek mountain warriors are reportedly advancing in two directions, less than eighteen miles from Argirokastro. Argirokastro is the gateway to the Albanian capital, Tirana. On the southern front, the Greek forces are said to have seized a large quantity of military supplies and captured hundreds of prisoners from the Italian forces. It is also reported that the majority of the 11,000 residents of Argyrokastron welcomed the Greek forces with loud cheers. Greek sources say that the fires set by the retreating Italian troops were extinguished by the Greek fire brigade. At the same time, it is reported that the Greek left wing, currently near Sarandë, is pursuing and pressing the Italian forces retreating towards Himarë. It is reported that the Italian forces are attempting to establish a defensive position at Palermo, six miles south of Himarë, but other Greek columns on the right wing are advancing towards Tepelenë and Përmet, threatening to encircle several thousand Italian troops attempting to establish a new defensive line in this area. (International, 9th)

Argyrokastron: The battle of Argyrokastron ended at noon yesterday when the last position of the Italian forces in the area was taken. The Italian forces used heavy tanks to block the narrow streets of the city, but eventually retreated to their final position in the city center. Greek troops captured one position after another, attacking the Italian tanks with what seemed like madness, aiming rifles at the drivers of the tanks and firing rapidly. Some Greek soldiers also threw hand grenades into the tank openings. The Italian tanks between the buildings were heavily attacked by Greek artillery. The final assault began at dawn, with Greek artillery teams in the surrounding mountains fiercely bombarding the Italian forces holding the main roads. A reporter witnessed a roof being destroyed by Greek artillery fire and the Italian troops fleeing. (United Press, Argyrokastron Correspondent, 9th)

Athens: After the official announcement of the Greek capture of Argyrokastron and its surrounding lands, the people here held enthusiastic celebrations. They also learned that the Greek soldiers had advanced northward from this important city in southern Albania. It is reported that the Greek forces are currently pursuing the routed Italian troops, and their advance is so rapid that it is difficult for their supply lines to keep up. In the northern area, despite the obstacles of terrain and climate, the Greek forces have crossed the mountain ranges and are approaching Argirokastro, cutting off the enemy's retreat. It is also reported that a Greek unit has entered a village only eight miles from Argirokastro. Argirokastro is an extremely important central city in Albania, located south of Tirana, only twenty-four miles from the capital. (United Press, 9th)

London: According to a Reuters correspondent at the Yugoslav-Albanian border, the main force of the Italian army in Albania is currently retreating towards Argirokastro. Greek troops have occupied the village of Radomickë, the last stronghold of Italian resistance in front of Lian, and one of the important strongholds in the northern area. The Italian forces are desperately trying to prevent the Greek forces from breaking through to the road west of Lian and Argirokastro, so fierce hand-to-hand combat has broken out between the two sides, resulting in heavy casualties on both sides. Fierce battles are also taking place on the high ground from Lian to Leshnicë. If the Greek forces can capture Leshnicë, they can reach Kukës and Argirokastro. The Greek forces have begun a fierce attack on these two areas of high ground. (Reuters, 9th)

Athens: Last night, the whole of Greece celebrated throughout the night, recognizing the occupation of Argyrokastron as the greatest Greek victory since the start of the Greek-Italian conflict. The Greek High Command announced that the Greek forces now hold one-seventh of Albanian territory and have liberated one-quarter of the Albanian population, freeing them from Italian rule. Recent Greek communiqués stated that the Greek forces had achieved new victories in attacks on all fronts last night, seizing new strategic positions. It is said that the road from Pogradec to Argyrokastron, a vital supply line for the Italian forces, is now partially in Greek hands. On the northern front, two Greek columns are advancing west and north of Pogradec to encircle the defeated Italian forces. According to reports, the lead elements of the Greek forces have already crossed the river near the source of the Shkumbin River and are advancing westward along the riverbank, threatening the left flank and rear of the Italian line. The roads to Tirana and Durrës converge at Argirokastro, making the position of Argirokastro extremely important. It is reported that the elite Italian Alpini troops are fiercely resisting the Greek forces, and Italian reinforcements are rushing to the area. It is also reported that another Greek column is advancing west of Korçë along a road parallel to the Devoll River, which runs from south to Argirokastro. The objective of these multiple Greek advances is to threaten the Albanian oil fields between the Devoll and Shkumbin rivers, which are the only natural petroleum resources owned by the Italian Fascist Party. It is also reported that on the road to Argyrokastron, after two hours of fierce fighting, the Greek forces defeated the last Italian rearguard. The Greek forces immediately used the large quantities of weapons and ammunition captured in Argyrokastron and advanced further north, occupying new high ground and villages. (International News Service, 9th)

A Glorious Page in Greek Military History: Athens Celebrates Triumphantly

Athens: The official announcement of the capture of the important Albanian stronghold of Argyrokastron has sparked the most fervent celebrations among the Greek people. Greek flags are flying throughout the city of Athens. On every street, British and Scottish soldiers are holding hands with Greeks, jumping and dancing. The national anthems of Greece and Britain are being played, shaking the whole city. King George II of Greece appeared on the balcony of the General Headquarters, waving to the crowds to celebrate the third victory in two weeks. Reports from Argyrokastron state that the most famous Greek troops stormed the narrow streets of the city, fighting hand-to-hand with bayonets. After a long street battle in front of the city hall with the Italian "Suicide Squad", the city was finally occupied. When the news arrived, church bells rang loudly, and people gathered in the streets in the moonlight, tearing down the glorious Greek flag on the Acropolis hill and raising it in the streets.

Rapid Progress on All Fronts: Greek Prime Minister Commends the Three Armed Forces

Athens: Today, Greece is enthusiastically celebrating the capture of Argyrokastron. The Greek forces are now continuing their work of driving the Italian troops into the sea. According to recent communiqués, the Greek forces have won victories on all fronts, resulting in the occupation of several important positions in Albanian territory. It is widely rumored that the Greek forces have crossed the Drin River and are advancing. The Italian forces continue to retreat along the entire line. It is heard that the Greek forces on the northern coast have occupied a village of great military importance. The Italian forces put up fierce resistance in heavy rain. After receiving news of the capture of Argyrokastron, Greek Prime Minister Metaxas sent telegrams to commend the entire army. (Reuters, 9th)

Greek Generals Issue Commands from High in the Mountains

Albanian Battlefield: From this small fortress on the mountain ridge, resembling an eagle's nest, the command of the Greek division directed the glorious battle of the attack on Argyrokastron. Looking down the mountain, the main road meandered through the valley, surrounded by snow-capped mountains that reached into the clouds. This humble cottage, constructed of several stone rooms on the rocky mountainside, was almost invisible from the air. Inside, officers used high-powered telescopes to observe small battles on the opposite mountain. Greek soldiers were seen waving flags to report on the situation below. Large logs burned in the room, the fire blazing. Telephones were arranged like a battle line, with wires like nets. Another inner room contained a wireless radio, constantly transmitting new orders. This reporter waited six hours before sending this dispatch because Italian forces had blown up a stone bridge, and Greek forces had to build a wooden bridge across the flooded river before transportation could pass. The mountain road was filled with horses and mule trains, with mud deep enough to reach the ankles. Newly painted Greek insignias on captured Italian vehicles rumbled past us, forcing us to step off the road and wait. The reporter passed numerous Greek mountain artillery teams accurately firing, pursuing the remnants of the Italian forces in Argyrokastron from high up. The reporter also saw soldiers on the mountainside heading towards the Argyrokastron area, where hand-to-hand combat would be required, and artillery would be useless. The reporter was no more than six hundred yards from the Greek vanguard. The sound of machine guns was very dense, but details of the front line were still unclear. The main force of the Italian troops had clearly withdrawn from Argyrokastron, leaving only a rearguard to resist the pursuers. (United Press, 9th)

Heavy Fighting on the Northern Front as Armies Contest the Gates of Argirokastro

Capital of Southern Country: According to news from the Albanian front, the Italian and Greek armies are engaged in extremely fierce fighting north of Pogradec, contesting the village of Radomickë. The village is the gateway to the Argirokastro highway. The Italian forces have established strong defenses. The Greek forces actively advanced yesterday and reached the outskirts of the village, but suffered heavy losses. The Greek forces launched a heavy attack on the high ground west of Pogradec yesterday, attempting to link up the northern and southern Greek forces. According to news from Athens, the Greek forces have not yet occupied Argyrokastron because the city is currently in flames, but the Greek forces have encircled it. The Greek Minister of Economy, Klimbas, visited Korçë on the 7th and allocated one million Greek drachmas (equivalent to one franc) to aid civilians. The city lacks food. Greek Prime Minister General Metaxas has ordered food to be transported to Korçë. (Haitong, 9th)

Milan: According to this morning's "Popolo d'Italia", fierce fighting is taking place on the left wing of the Italian positions in the Pogradec mountain area. The Greek forces have brought up a large number of reinforcements and have gained some local victories. The Italian forces are putting up strong resistance. The Italian air force has also participated in the battle. Although the weather is terrible, and fighting in the snow and ice is extremely difficult, the Italian forces have sent planes to bomb various Greek positions. Greek ammunition depots near Esaki have been hit by Italian bombs. (Haitong, 9th)

Rome Communiqué Acknowledges Defeat: Italian Troops on the Front Retreat to New Positions

Although the weather is terrible, our air force is still active, bombing military targets in Mara and Ada Bay. In North Africa, our artillery fired on enemy motorized units southeast of Rabia. Enemy aircraft bombed Chochalesi and Dachna, killing one civilian and injuring five, with minor material damage. (Haitong, 9th)

All bombs hit the target area, but the results are unknown. (Reuters, 9th)

British and Greek Troops Fighting Side by Side: A Sketch of Battlefield Life

Greek Front: The Greek army is continuing to advance across this vast battlefield of 125 miles, now 50 miles deep into the Morava Mountains near Lake Ohrid. The area seized by the Greek army from the Italian army is nearly a quarter of Albanian territory. The total area of Albania is 17,500 square miles, and 4,000 square miles have been captured by the Greek army. As the reporter followed the army to the Pogradec highland area, the northeastern side of the Greek line, he heard Greek and British soldiers singing the "Tipperary" war song. Although this is an old march, it has been given a new look, because they are singing not about going to "Tipperary", but about going to "Tirana". One of the singing soldiers told the reporter that he served in the British army during the previous World War, so he sang the "Tipperary" song to prove it. In addition to carrying rifles, the Greek soldiers also carry hay for the mules and horses to eat, and a blanket to wrap around their heads to ward off the cold. However, they do not carry gas masks. The Greek soldiers' diet usually consists of black bread and rice cooked with mutton fat. They cherish every good meal and consider themselves lucky. The Greek soldiers eat Aleboudi, while the British soldiers eat chocolate and jam. Beef, wine, and cigarettes are extremely scarce. Between Korçë and the front line, the reporter only occasionally encountered some ragged old women amidst the sound of artillery fire. Many young women had fled into the mountains when their husbands took up arms to attack the Italians. The cafes in the villages near the front line often have a radio. Greek soldiers often listen to the BBC's Greek language broadcasts to learn about the war news. The Greek soldiers are very enthusiastic about everything. (United Press, 9th)

### Italian Army, Navy, and Air Force Chiefs of Staff Take Office; Fascist Military Leadership Completely Reorganized; Commander-in-Chief of the Invasion of Ethiopia Resigns, Request Not Granted

Rome: When General Cavallero, the Chief of Staff of the Italian Army, Navy, and Air Force, took office yesterday, he addressed the staff officers of the three armed forces, saying that he had taken office by order of the King and the Prime Minister and that he hoped everyone would do their best to achieve final victory. At the same time, Cavallero replied to Prime Minister Mussolini, vowing to do his utmost to achieve final victory. (Haitong, 9th)

Cairo: According to news arriving here today, Italian Commander-in-Chief of the Invasion of Ethiopia, General Graziani, has submitted his resignation, but this news could not be confirmed. It is heard that Mussolini has refused to accept Graziani's resignation request. It is rumored that Graziani's resignation was submitted after the demotion of Italian Chief of Staff Badoglio. (International News Service, 9th) Rome: Italian Prime Minister Mussolini yesterday continued to reorganize the highest generals of the Fascist military leadership with vigorous steps. The major changes in the past three days aim to instill new-style blitzkrieg tactics into the commanders, so that they can take the offensive in Albania and Africa. The new Navy Commander, Riccardi, after taking over the vacancy left by former Commander Cavagnari yesterday, will intensify cooperation between the Italian Navy and Air Force to deal with the Greek forces. (According to London, Mussolini is sweeping away all the highest generals to cultivate Fascist ideas in the army and navy.) A special communiqué from the Italian government stated that Navy Commander Cavagnari's "voluntary resignation" was due to a sincere letter from Mussolini, which stated, "I am extremely pleased with Your Excellency's hard work in developing the Italian Navy over the past seven years," and so on. Cavagnari had participated in the Boxer Rebellion and the invasion of Beijing. During the Shanghai conflict in 1932, he also came to Shanghai on the "Salerno" warship. He returned to Italy the following year. Also, there were two minor changes in the Italian Navy command yesterday. One was the promotion of Commander Campioni to Deputy Chief of Naval Staff, and the other was the appointment of Commander Iachino as Commander of Italian warships at sea. This change in naval personnel, following the removal of Army Chief of Staff Badoglio and Dodecanese Governor De Vecchi, is of great significance. (United Press, 9th)

Rome: There were also transfers of Italian naval personnel yesterday. This may be a prelude to the Italian fleet engaging in a contest with the British fleet. The conservative Italian Chief of Naval Staff, General Cavagnari, has been replaced by the activist Admiral Riccardi, who is known for advocating joint operations between aircraft and warships. (International, 9th)

Rome: The new Italian Chief of Naval Staff, Admiral Riccardi, is 62 years old and was born in Pavia, near Milan. He was appointed a senator in 1939. After becoming Chief of Staff, he will also serve concurrently as Undersecretary of the Navy. (Haitong, 9th)

The report that Bologna had been bombed by British aircraft is also inaccurate. (Haitong, 9th)

### The United States Quickly Aides Greece, Agrees to Sell Thirty Destroyers; Recognizes That the Greek-Italian War Has Reached a Decisive Stage

Washington: The United States has agreed to sell the first thirty Curtiss destroyers to Greece. Informed sources believe that this move is the United States quickly implementing its policy of aiding countries at war who have been invaded. It is revealed that some of these thirty Curtiss aircraft originally belonged to the United States itself, while others were intended to be transported to Britain, but if London agrees, these aircraft will be transported to Greece. After the Greek government requested the United States to supply aircraft and other aid, the United States immediately followed up with aid to Greece. U.S. government officials revealed that the Greek requests would be given sympathetic consideration. Observers here believe that U.S. aid to Greece will not be limited to thirty Curtiss aircraft. Military experts say that the Italian-Greek war has reached a decisive stage, and express their opinion that if Britain and Greece launch a fierce attack on Albania, followed by an attack on Italy, the southern end of the Axis powers will be cut off. Observers believe that the battles on the mountains and plains of Albania are no less important than the battles on the banks of the Thames. The future of Europe and the world rests on this.

### Happiness Knowledge After Marriage by American Medical Doctor

— Huang Zhongchang

Secrets to Maintaining Health During Youth

Seventeen and eighteen-year-old youths, because of their physiological maturity, begin to leave behind the innocence of childhood and enter the beginning of life. If they contract common illnesses during this period, or engage in behaviors that harm their body and mind, the consequences can affect their happiness for life. Moreover, a youth's most precious virginity is often lost to sexual urges at this time, leading to immense troubles. The most common of these is indulging in masturbation, depleting their essence and exhausting their brain, casting a dark shadow on the bright path of life. This is extremely dangerous.

Masturbation is almost unavoidable for boys during adolescence because their sexual urges are at their strongest at this time. Therefore, they focus on the opposite sex, indulging in fantasies, which in turn triggers the urge to masturbate.

After excessive masturbation, the first symptom to appear is frequent seminal emission. This condition can be considered a sign of neurasthenia. The only way to treat it is to first completely stop masturbating, then strictly adhere to health maintenance, taking a warm water sitz bath for half an hour every day, and massaging the area with cold water. These methods are quite effective, but they only serve as an auxiliary treatment. It is also necessary to take three "Nels Seminal Emission Tablets" before bed every day to strengthen the seminal gate and eliminate the hypersensitivity of the ejaculation mechanism. The effect is indeed better than any other sperm-strengthening pills. If a person suffering from frequent nocturnal emissions is left untreated, it often leads to sexual dysfunction, such as impotence, premature ejaculation, and penile atrophy. Treatment then becomes more difficult, requiring active administration of testicular endocrine therapy to restore energy and enhance sexual power.

Speaking of which, I must use my thirty years of clinical experience to explain the efficacy of the truly high-quality testicular essence preparation for men, "Butaikang," which is unanimously praised by modern medical scientists for treating this condition.

The reason why "Butaikang" is so effective in treating premature ejaculation and penile atrophy is solely due to its lasting vigor. This is attributed to the meticulous and comprehensive extraction process, which preserves the precious elements. Although patients with mild symptoms experience miraculous effects after taking just one bottle, according to my experience as a doctor, it is necessary to take three bottles consecutively and strictly adhere to health maintenance to completely cure the chronic disease without any problems. I sincerely advise masturbation sufferers that if they feel a decline in brainpower, sexual power, or physical strength, then "Butaikang" for men is definitely worth a try.

### Case of Cured Limb Coldness

— Zheng Ting, German Medical Doctor

Patient Yu Chengda, 37 years old, from Ningbo, Zhejiang Province, residing at No. 2, Yong'an Lane, Sanban Factory, this city (self-report): "I was born with congenital deficiency. I also had seminal emissions before marriage. After marriage, I felt kidney deficiency. After the age of 30, I became increasingly spiritless. I felt lower back pain and backache even after sitting for a short time. From the age of 35, I would tremble all over and my limbs would be ice-cold whenever the seasons changed, making it impossible to get out of bed. The signs of aging are disheartening. I beg for treatment, etc." (Symptoms upon examination): "Weight 95 pounds, pale complexion, chronically suffering from insomnia. Although sexual activity is not excessive, premature ejaculation is severe, indicating a deficiency in both blood and kidneys, resulting in premature aging." (Treatment process): "Instructed him to engage in exercise, refrain from smoking and drinking alcohol, and take three "Butaikang" testicular essence tablets for men three times a day during the day. After taking the medication, he immediately felt a great boost in spirit, and symptoms such as lower back pain, backache, and cold limbs were completely cured. This is because "Butaikang" functions to promote metabolism, eliminate neurasthenia, nourish the brain, nourish the kidneys, replenish blood, and promote the development of reproductive organs, making it quite suitable for the condition. Mr. Yu took the medication continuously for two months, and the aforementioned symptoms were completely cured. His weight has increased by seven pounds. He was examined for sexual function. He stopped taking the medication at the end of last month, and his weight reached 110 pounds, his complexion is rosy, and his appetite has increased. In the past, Mr. Yu would experience cold limbs every autumn and winter, but even in the harsh winter now, he does not feel cold."

The Painful History of the European War (5)

### A Chronicle of the Last Days of Warsaw

A woman sits on the ground, peeling sweet potatoes. A young girl, old enough to wear a hairpin, applies makeup in front of a mirror next to her bombed-out apartment. Two boys read a Mickey Mouse comic strip from a Polish newspaper. Fourteen dead horses lie scattered on the road, and members of the volunteer team are carrying lime to cover them. Twenty feet away, there are ten more corpses. These ten people had sought refuge in a cave but still could not escape death. Nearby, a boy wanders aimlessly, carrying a birdcage with a canary inside.

A certain area was completely devastated by bombing, with not a single building intact. Everywhere you look, you see crowds of residents, some walking, some riding bicycles, and some pushing carts and baby carriages, loaded with bedding and a small amount of food, having lost their homes and scattered to find shelter. Every night at 9:30 PM, German bombers fly over and wreak havoc, intensifying as time goes on. By dawn, another part of Warsaw has been destroyed. Citizens without homes flock to other parts of the city, seeking any place to stay. Rich and poor mingle, without regard to status, and money is useless.

Initially, Warsaw was only bombed. By September 13th, the city center was within range of the German artillery. German planes circled overhead, directing the artillery to bombard the streets. The shells exploded in the air, and those hit by the shrapnel were either killed or injured, without exception.

Around September 17th, the German army began a fierce artillery bombardment, with 10,000 to 30,000 shells falling on Warsaw every day, making it dangerous to walk in the open. Even the anti-aircraft teams could not abandon their work. Later, the air raid sirens stopped sounding, and warnings of impending bombardment could only be heard on the radio.

The shelling was most intense at night, and every morning hundreds of corpses were found in the streets, buried on the side of the road or in nearby parks. The number of German cannons increased daily, and the bombardment lasted for six brutal days. By the end of the bombardment, there was not a single intact glass window in Warsaw.

I stood in the garden of the American Embassy and saw a German bomber shot down by anti-aircraft fire. Fortunately, I had a camera with me and was able to photograph the scene of the German plane catching fire and crashing.

After the German plane crashed, I rushed to the scene and saw the wreckage of the plane still smoking. All four crew members were dead. As a human being, I should have felt sad about the plane crashing with its crew, as it is human nature to do so. However, I actually cheered and shouted with two other American expatriates. We had forgotten the families of the German pilots, and only recognized that these pilots represented the German government that had been massacring innocent people for the past three weeks. Therefore, we could not help but rejoice at the death of the pilots. This is how war affects people's hearts.

September 16th was the Jewish New Year. That night, German planes flew over and dropped many incendiary bombs on the Jewish quarter of Warsaw, causing fires, with flying embers stinging both eyes. Walls collapsed, a shocking sight. Within three hours, twenty square buildings had been reduced to rubble. That night, thousands were left homeless, the injured could not be rescued, and the corpses could not be removed.

When Warsaw was besieged, the front lines were at the edge of the city. Polish soldiers returned to the city from the front lines every day to collect food for their families, at least to see that their families had food and were safe, and then return to the front lines with peace of mind. More civilians died than soldiers, so husbands fighting on the front lines were less concerned about their own survival than about whether their families were still alive at home.

Day after day, the danger intensified, and it was not easy for me to remain a bystander to the tragedy. On September 15th, Polish officials asked me to broadcast in English on Warsaw Radio for ten minutes so that the outside world would know that all neutral American expatriates were suffering. I could not refuse this request.

The radio station had been bombed repeatedly for several days. After I finished broadcasting, I quickly left, and my mind was at ease. Afterwards, I was even more impressed by the bravery of those who stayed in the building day and night, and the telephone operators.

One day, I had the opportunity to photograph more than twenty captured young German soldiers and repeatedly asked them why they inflicted such terrible suffering on the Polish civilians. They all replied in unison, "We have to do this."

In the following days, rumors abounded, such as large squadrons of British and French planes would come to help, there was a rebellion in Germany, and the war was about to end, and so on. The most unrealistic was that the two armies would cease fire to allow neutral country expatriates to safely leave Warsaw. This rumor actually became a reality.

On September 21st, the radio station announced that there would be a three-hour ceasefire from 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM to allow all expatriates with neutral country passports to evacuate. We gathered at the Bristol Hotel and saw German planes flying over, dropping leaflets written in clumsy Polish that said, "Poles, you can rest now! If you do not surrender immediately, we will have to bomb you with planes and cannons." The Poles read it and burst out laughing.

Our group of 1,200 expatriates from thirty countries set off in several trucks at 4:30 PM, crossed the Vistula River, and passed through a residential area of rubble. Countless workers' homes had been burned to the ground. We continued forward to the front lines and got out of the vehicles to walk. We could not help but shed tears when we shook hands and said goodbye to the Polish soldiers on the front lines. Before long, we could faintly see German soldiers in the distance. As we got closer, we saw young German soldiers wearing new gray uniforms, welcoming us with joy. Some hugged babies, some kindly helped carry suitcases, and others took off their coats to lend to women to keep warm. They were all smiling and polite. They had been attacking us for weeks, and now they were carrying our suitcases and caressing our babies. German officers filmed the scene to show the German army's friendliness.

We then arrived in Königsberg, Germany, and stayed in hotels, all under surveillance. With a thoughtful look on my face, I went to a barbershop to get a haircut and could not help but ask the barber why Germany had invaded Poland. He replied, "Don't you know that we never attacked Poland? The barbaric Poles repeatedly attacked Germany, and we were forced to defend ourselves."

I also went to see a movie, and the newsreel showed the destruction in Poland. The Germans were clearly proud of conquering Poland. One thing worth noting was that even though the war film lasted for half an hour, there was no applause or cheering. Even when it showed Hitler mingling with soldiers on the front lines like brothers, there was no cheering. The audience certainly saw the German army victoriously marching into Poland, but they also saw the ruins left in the wake of the German army and the frightened faces of the Polish refugees. This was actually a powerful anti-war propaganda, but the German side obviously did not notice it.

Today, Warsaw is full of ruins, and those who crawl on the streets are suffering from hunger and disease, with no one to help. The Germans have stipulated that if one Pole carrying weapons is arrested, ten people will be executed. And if a Germanized Pole (whom the Poles call traitors) is "silently killed," one hundred Poles will be executed, and men and women will be driven to a broad area to watch the execution. A few Poles shouted "Poland will never die!" when they were executed by firing squad.

Typhus is rampant, and coal is scarce. German soldiers returning from Poland speak of "a graveyard-like atmosphere, the silent submission of the peasants, and the hatred in the eyes of the murdered dignitaries," and still seem fearful.

The German army has handed over the difficult task of ruling Poland to the secret police. Civilian criminals are flogged sixty to one hundred and twenty times every few days. Priests are not allowed to perform absolution rites for those being executed. Art treasures from Warsaw and Krakow have been transported to Germany. (The End)

Education News

### Education Commissioner Xu Summarizes Education in Zhejiang Province Over the Past Year (4)

(2) Regarding Township and Village Chiefs Concurrently Serving as Principals, or Principals Concurrently Serving as Township and Village Chiefs, this was originally an economical measure due to a lack of talent. It is stipulated in the outline of county-level organizations and the implementation guidelines for national education, namely the so-called "three-in-one system." Unfortunately, the qualifications for Township and Village Chiefs and the qualifications for Principals are different, resulting in Township and Village Chiefs not meeting the qualifications for Principals, making it difficult to serve concurrently. The various difficulties raised by the counties are indeed factual, but ways to remedy the situation should be sought. The difficulties are roughly as follows: (1) Township and Village Chiefs are not knowledgeable about education; (2) Principals are not knowledgeable about self-governance; (3) It is appropriate for Township and Village Chiefs to be filled by local people; (4) Principals may be from other places; (5) Township and Village Chiefs will be elected in the future; (6) Principals are appointed; (7) Both parties have heavy workloads and cannot handle both; (8) Limited time and energy, taking care of one thing and neglecting the other. The difficulties mentioned above can be resolved using the following methods: (1) Temporarily fill the positions with those who can serve concurrently; (2) Provide short-term training to each; (3) Establish a Director of Instruction to handle school affairs; (4) Principals must concurrently serve as Deputy Township and Village Chiefs to facilitate coordination; (5) Appointment after the election is also possible.

(3) Compulsory education is necessary for the implementation of national education. The implementation steps proposed by the counties mostly follow the guidelines, including investigation, persuasion, posting names, and fines. In addition, little attention has been paid to how to use the Baojia system, how to divide districts, and how to stipulate the age for admission in order of priority. In the future, attention should be paid to (1) defining the scope of school districts; (2) ascertaining the number and age of children and people who should be admitted; (3) stipulating the number and age of people who should be admitted; (4) using Baojia chiefs to persuade and supervise; (5) finally implementing compulsory measures.

(4) As for raising funds for national elementary schools, the circumstances of each school are different, so it is not possible to generalize. On the one hand, the fund-raising methods should be followed, and on the other hand, the local conditions should be considered. However, attention must be paid to (1) actively creating property as a permanent plan; (2) actively organizing existing educational funds and public property to prevent private control; (3) avoiding excessive taxation and disturbing the people to facilitate implementation; (4) focusing on raising large amounts of funds from properties such as ancestral property, cemetery property, and association property; as for temple property, which is the most common and most numerous type of property, it is restricted by the regulations on the supervision of temples, and it is necessary to request the central government to amend the percentage of funds allocated for subsidies before it can be handled.

(5) The issue of teachers is one of the major issues in the implementation of national education. The cultivation of teachers cannot be completed in the short term, so the methods proposed by the counties are mostly stopgap measures, such as registration, screening, testing, examination, workshops, and short-term training. Only five or six counties are able to establish simple normal schools. In the future, attention should be paid to (1) establishing simple normal schools and reducing the number of middle schools; (2) utilizing junior high school students to teach; (3) conducting planned short-term training; (4) conducting small teacher qualification examinations every semester; (5) transferring teachers for training; (6) rewarding advanced studies; (7) strengthening the guidance organization and implementing guidance work.

(6) Regarding the various laws and regulations on national education, there are still some that should be discussed and revised. The opinions raised by the counties will be collected, further studied, and then recommendations will be made to the Department of Education.

3. Regarding School Education

There are many problems that need to be improved in today's elementary school education. The provincial supervisors have repeatedly given instructions after their inspections, but the schools have rarely complied. Here are the major problems: school facilities, children's health, and the treatment, evaluation, rewards, and punishments of teachers. These are all critical issues.

(1) First, regarding school facilities, for example, (1) equipment is empty, with no newspapers, books, charts, or diagrams, making it impossible to teach even with good teachers; (2) the school grounds and farms lack equipment, making the so-called production labor training empty words; (3) the sports fields are not equipped, making it difficult to train children's physical fitness and difficult to hold public gatherings; (4) the wartime environment lacks arrangements on how to enhance children's and the public's anti-war sentiments and cultivate patriotic concepts; (5) sanitary facilities are completely absent, making it impossible to develop neat and clean habits, which has a great impact on children's health; (6) forms and registers are not available, making the statistics of the entire county, province, and country inaccurate; (7) the number of places is insufficient, and even though many schools are established, they do not make up for the reality and only waste public funds; (8) teaching in dialects limits children to one area and treats compatriots from other places as foreigners (to be continued)

### Chengdu's Three Institutions Unite to Promote Rural Vocational Education

(Chengdu Correspondence) The Sichuan Provincial Department of Education, the Agricultural Production Promotion Committee of the Executive Yuan, and the China Vocational Education Society have recently jointly launched rural vocational education and have designated eight acres of land south of Jinjiang River outside Xin Nanmen, east of Taiping Street, and west of Xincun as the first phase of the promotion area. The focus of education will be on farmers and small-scale factories in the area. In order to increase farmers' production, they are promoting the hand-weaving industry. A small workshop will be established in the area with 20 to 30 hand-spinning machines. Personnel from the hand-weaving training institute of the Agricultural Production Promotion Committee will be sent to guide and encourage local women farmers to come and learn. The goal is to complete the training in one month, and then loan out machines to each household. The area will supply the raw materials, let them spin them into cotton yarn, which will be purchased by the area, assembled, and sold centrally, gradually expanding the scale. The hope is to create a weaving area in the shortest possible time to achieve the goal of self-sufficiency. At the same time, it has also been decided to unite with the Sichuan University College of Agriculture and the Agricultural Improvement Institute to introduce improved vegetable seeds to the area, assist in pest control, and lend improved agricultural tools in order to reduce costs and increase production. Furthermore, during farmers' and workers' spare time, they will be encouraged to go to school to receive education, learn common knowledge and practical literacy, establish a medical room, promote public health, and consult with the National Bank to provide cash loans in the area to benefit the common people. Preparations are currently underway.

### Finance - Forward Foreign Exchange - Lacking Demand - Due to Long-Term Outlook

Yesterday's foreign exchange market conditions: HSBC's listed prices showed no changes. The British-American exchange market was stagnant. Initially, the spot market had softened due to speculators hedging, but the amount was minimal. However, forward exchange lacked demand and remained firm, indicating that operators are taking a long-term view. In the afternoon, Chinese banks became unwilling to sell, and buyers were nowhere to be found, causing prices to rebound and become firm. At closing, both spot and forward prices were the same: British gold at 3 pence 765625, American exchange at 5.96875 yuan. Forward prices were calculated to be 0.015625 and 0.03125 yuan looser.

Recent Tightening Seen

In the morning, private exchange rates for British to American, Shanghai, etc., were flat. American to British, Shanghai, etc., also showed no fluctuations. Central Bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. Banks opened with spot selling prices of 3 pence 78125 for Central Bank gold and 5.96875 yuan for American exchange, the same as Saturday's closing prices. After the opening, the market was calm. It was rumored that the Netherlands Trading Society had purchased spot American exchange, which Chinese banks sold at 5.96875 yuan. HSBC's listed prices were announced to be unchanged, and the silver equalization tax was also unchanged. Subsequently, the underlying trend tightened slightly, as there were few sellers, initially causing prices to soften simultaneously. Hong Kong Power sold this month's foreign exchange to foreign banks at 3 pence 1765625. Speculators then had demand and rushed to buy this month's American exchange at 5.9375 yuan from Youli Bank and foreign banks. At the noon close, spot British gold was at 3 pence 765625 and American exchange at 5.9375 yuan, a decrease of 0.015625 and 0.03125 yuan compared to the morning opening.

Result Close to Flat with Forwards Easier

The market then rebounded, partly due to reduced trading and partly because Chinese banks were unwilling to sell, lacking counterparts. Only Youli Bank absorbed a little, causing prices to rise slightly. This month's Shanghai branch of Chinese banks sold to Youli Bank at 5.96875 yuan, and the situation remained the same at the close. As a result, both spot and forward British gold closed at 3 pence 765625, and American exchange at 5.96875 yuan, with forward prices 0.015625 and 0.03125 yuan looser than Saturday's close. Near-term and spot prices were uniformly flat.

Hong Kong Market Fluctuated Slightly

Hong Kong, 9th (Monday) dispatch: The exchange market opened flat this morning. Spot prices for British, American, and Japanese exchange showed no changes. British forward exchange opened at 1 shilling 3 pence. Shanghai exchange spot fell 50 cents to 395.5 yuan. At 10:55 AM, it was stable. American exchange spot tightened 0.0625 to 23.6875 yuan. Shanghai exchange spot rebounded 5 yuan to 396 yuan. At 11:30 AM, it was stable. Shanghai exchange spot continued to rise 2.5 yuan to 398.5 yuan, with the rest unchanged. At 2:10 PM in the afternoon, it was flat. Shanghai exchange spot fell back 2 yuan to 396.5 yuan, with the rest unchanged.

Tianjin American Exchange Slightly Soft

Tianjin, (Monday) dispatch: The exchange market opened flat this morning. London telegraphic transfer was unchanged, still opening at 4 pence 25. New York telegraphic transfer softened 0.03125 to 6.6875 yuan. Shanghai exchange fell 25 cents, and "Joint Notes" on the black market also rose 25 cents, with both rates at 88.5 yuan. The market will be closed for one day tomorrow (Tuesday).

### Gold Market: Widespread Buying Interest - Once Breaking Through the 5,800 Yuan Barrier

Yesterday's black market for spot gold rose in the first half of the day and was flat and weak in the second half. The result was still a gain, and confidence remained firm. Initially, foreign exchange was reported to be soft, coupled with widespread buying interest, causing prices to rise sharply, once breaking through the 5,800 yuan barrier to reach 5,810 yuan. It was rumored that gold firms and their clients were increasing their long positions, and a certain bank was covering its short positions, resulting in strong upward pressure. Later, the exchange market turned flat, buying interest gradually dissipated, and selling to close positions before the close caused prices to retreat slightly. As a result, the closing price was 5,786 yuan, up 15 yuan from Saturday. Total trading volume was over 4,000 taels. No swaps were done. Premiums were around 10 yuan. Gold firms issued securities for 200 taels of spot gold at a price 10 yuan lower than the futures price. Silver shops did not change jewelry prices, and customs gold was flat.

Spot Gold Rose Very Little

Initially, sentiment was excited. At the opening, buyers pushed prices up slightly to 9,780 yuan. It was said that gold firms issued 20 taels to banks. Before long, banks sold 30 taels to gold firms, lowering the price by 10 yuan to 5,772 yuan. Shortly thereafter, buying interest was extremely high due to a certain client of a gold firm increasing their long position, reaching 5,800 yuan. Qian Dui Ye (money changers) had entered 20 taels into banks. Although scattered sellers appeared, the price increase was only about 10 yuan. It was said that gold firms issued securities for 20 taels, quoting 5,785 yuan. Ultimately, due to the softening exchange market, banks helped to cover short positions, and with low supply and high demand, prices broke through the 5,800 yuan barrier. Qian Dui Ye did 20 taels at 5,810 yuan. However, some people took the opportunity to sell at high prices. Soon, prices re-entered the 5,800 yuan range. It was said that banks did 20 taels at 5,785 yuan. Until the close, there was little fluctuation. The result was 5,789 yuan. In the afternoon, there was little gain or loss, with fluctuations of only 1-2 yuan. At the opening, gold firms entered 20 taels into banks at 5,790 yuan. Later, the securities firm entered 20 taels into banks at 5,792 yuan. Finally, due to Qian and gold firms selling to close positions, it was slightly weak before the close. It was said that banks did 30 taels at 5,775 yuan. The result was that banks did 30 taels at 5,786 yuan, up 15 yuan from Saturday. The high and low for the day differed by 35 yuan. Gold firms' listed price for spot gold was over 10 yuan higher than that of spot gold, and the purchase price was 30 yuan lower. Currently, jewelry gold is 50-60 yuan lower than listed gold, and little business is done.

Jewelry Gold Remained Unchanged

The exchange price for silver jewelry remained unchanged. Datongheng was listing 590 yuan, and Xintongheng's price was similar, with the purchase price about 30 yuan lower.

Foreign Currency Fluctuations Very Slight

Yesterday's foreign currency market situation: spot prices fluctuated very slightly, ultimately trending slightly higher. British and American gold pounds rose slightly by 50 cents. British gold notes were stagnant as before. The market price was flat. American gold notes once rose to 16 yuan 78 cents, ultimately retreating to 16 yuan 73 cents, a slight increase of 1 cent from Saturday. Hong Kong notes tended to soften slightly, with the market at 4 yuan 01 cent. Japanese gold notes again fell, with the evening market at 1 yuan 53 and a half cents. The upward trend of Korean notes had stopped, with the evening market still at 1 yuan 27 cents.

Discount and Call Rates Varied

Yesterday's discount rate for exchange drafts suddenly fell again. The discount rate for entering was 75 cents per thousand yuan, and for exiting, it was 1 yuan 25 cents, 25 cents smaller than Saturday. The money industry association's call rate rose 1 cent, with both morning and afternoon markets quoting 7 cents.

### Securities - Domestic Bonds Calm

Yesterday's black market for securities was still in a state of consolidation. Class E bonds were slightly lower in the afternoon due to the calculation of winning numbers. Other bonds fluctuated, still in a state of contention between bulls and bears. There was still an element of uncertainty, preventing the bond market from rallying after the establishment of the international loan. Yesterday morning, Yitai, Tongshun, and the newly listed Yizhong all saw buying, while Hongda, Tongkang, Chengkang, Lianyi, Shuntai, and Zhongyi all saw selling. Market prices still felt weak and unable to rise, retreating slightly by two or three jiao. In the afternoon, Tongshun, Qia Tai, and Yizhong continued to buy, and Lianyi and Yongkang also showed considerable interest, but Hongda, Tongkang, and Chengkang continued to sell. Shengda, Lianhe, and Dingkang all saw selling. Class E bonds had the calculation of winning numbers removed, and market prices mostly rebounded slightly. As a result, they uniformly retreated by about one jiao, with Class E bonds retreating by seven jiao after the removal of winning rights. The total transaction volume was 1.78 million yuan. A simplified table is listed below:

Stock Trading: 100 shares of China National Products Public Co. stock were traded at a price of 27.

The public stock market was initially very firm but then gradually turned weaker, with little trading and a lack of public interest. After the auction of new shares of the Public Wool Company, 15 shares were traded, with the price falling from 7 yuan 3 jiao at the opening to 7 yuan 1 jiao. Among rubber stocks, only Yingzha Hua saw significant trading, while the rest were bleak.

### Sanxin Real Estate Reduces Capital

The total capital of Sanxin Real Estate Co., Ltd., managed by the British Jardine Matheson & Co., is 20 million taels of standard silver, divided into 2 million shares, with a par value of 10 taels of standard silver per share. The paid-up capital is 8.05707 million taels of standard silver, divided into 805,007 shares, with each share worth 10 taels of standard silver. A special shareholders' meeting is scheduled for December 31st of this year to discuss the issue of capital reduction, reducing the total capital to 14 million yuan in national currency, still divided into 2 million shares, with a par value of 7 yuan in national currency per share. It is proposed that 6 yuan 9 jiao 8 fen in national currency be returned for each share already issued.

### Sugar Market - Dutch Red Initially Tight, Then Flat

Yesterday's sugar market trend improved, rebounding slightly. The association's listed prices: cargo in public warehouses called for 73.5 yuan for coarse white native stock, up 5 jiao; 73 yuan for foreign stock, up 1 jiao. Dutch red was initially tight but then flat, with spot prices at 56 yuan 3 jiao to 2 jiao 5 fen, ultimately reaching 2 jiao. Taikoo's Car White B mark Western stock was 73 yuan 2 jiao, 3 jiao less; CW mark was 72 yuan 8 jiao; DY mark was 6 - 9 yuan 4 jiao; HX mark was 69 yuan 2 jiao, all up 3 jiao. Native factory No. 1 ice was 93 yuan, and Jingming ice was 94.5 yuan, unchanged.

### Yarn and Cotton - Futures Double Horse - Shenxin Opens 4,000 Bales

The yarn market is rising, and the bullish sentiment is particularly strong. However, some who made profits sold, causing a slight pullback. However, the overall trend is still firm. As for actual sales, demand for 32-count single yarn from the Hong Kong contingent remains strong, so prices are rising daily. 20-count yarn is also being stimulated, but not as strong as 32-count. Shenxin Factory opened 20-count Double Horse yarn for 4,000 bales at a price of 1,260 yuan, with delivery in January and February of next year, with a deposit of 150 yuan per bale. In the afternoon, the price of Double Horse yarn went from 1,263 yuan to 1,268 yuan.

The morning opening for Double Horse yarn was still good, with the initial price at 1,255 yuan. However, there were those who sold to scalp, causing a slight drop to 1,252 yuan. Subsequently, the market turned tight, as many were very interested. Small banks continued to absorb, and the market suddenly tightened. Buying interest was strong, and foreign exchange was also calm, with little change. Market prices gradually advanced to 1,271 yuan. At this time, those with floating profits suddenly sold, causing the market to drop to 1,265 yuan. However, bulls were still strong, and this continued for a long time. The scalp trade was closed, and it fell to 1,254 yuan. The closing price was 1,260 yuan. Statistics for midday trading showed 6,200 bales traded. 20-count Double Horse yarn rose 10 yuan. The amounts bought by each contingent are listed as follows:

Hong Kong 470 Ningbo 5

Same Trade 5,700 Wenzhou 10

Inland 15 Statistics 6,200

### Cotton Mills' Appetite Turns Active - 1,000 Bales of Indian Cotton Arrive in Shanghai

The current cotton situation is stable, but trading has increased slightly. Because the yarn market is good, Shenxin has sold a large amount of cotton yarn, so there should be some compensation for raw materials. Therefore, sentiment is firm, and the market should be optimistic. 1,000 bales of Indian cotton, shipped from Calcutta by Jardine Matheson's Tai Sheng, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning and berthed at Roosevelt Wharf for unloading.

In other news, foreign cotton market prices: The New York cotton market was quieter yesterday. Initially, it was due to selling on Wall Street and the closing of some long positions. Later, it rebounded slightly due to buying by the same trade. As a result, closing prices fell 4-5 pound sounds compared to the previous day. Indian cotton, including forecasts, fell by a large 5-6 rupees yesterday.

Trading in foreign cotton in Shanghai has become more active again in recent days. Factories have opened up about ten bales of cotton yarn, with a strong intention to replenish raw cotton. However, the amount of spot goods circulating on the market is not large, and the same trade's sentiment has become more bullish.

### Piece Goods - Cloth Market Continues to Show Strength

Yesterday, the factory cloth market continued to show strength, due to bullish sentiment and strong buying interest. Factory prices were raised, and cloth market prices all trended upwards. White goods, coarse cloth, and twill increased by 1 jiao to 2.5 jiao; fine cloth, gray cloth, and dyed cloth increased by 2 jiao to 5 jiao. Velvet was in short supply, and prices also increased by about 5 jiao. Transactions in this street included gray cloth, dyed cloth, poplin, and other spot goods for this month, totaling over 1,500 pieces. The Yongwen contingent traded over 200 pieces of dyed cloth, colored twill, printed cloth, coarse and fine cloth, poplin, and foreign yarn. The Min contingent traded over 100 pieces of blue cloth and colored twill. The Guangdong-Hong Kong contingent traded over 300 pieces of coarse and fine cloth, colored cloth, and poplin. The North Road Yantai contingent traded hundreds of pieces of velvet and coarse cloth.

Due to continued strong actual sales of Eastern cloth, selling prices gradually rose. White fine cloth rose again by 5-6 jiao per bolt. The closing price for 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth was 36 yuan 5 jiao and a half. Among medium-grade brands, Flying Fish was the most scarce, rising repeatedly to 35 yuan 1 jiao and a half. Four Gentlemen serge at 1 yuan 1 jiao 1 fen also continued to rise by 1.5 fen per yard.

### Horsehair Interlining Skyrockets

The horsehair interlining market is tight, and selling prices are skyrocketing. Most of the traders, except for Yuanchangxing and others, who have a small number of shops to meet customer needs, are out of stock and hard to find. The asking price is 1 yuan 7-8 jiao per yard, and it is not easy to obtain even for those who want to purchase 100-200 yards. This is due to a shortage of goods in the market. Horsehair interlining is essential for reinforcing the chest of Western suits. It was invented and woven in Jiangshan Village, Ningbo, so it is also known as Jiangshan interlining. It is woven by hand by housewives, who can only produce 1-2 yards a day. The raw materials are horsehair and yarn, which are sourced from Pingjin and transported to Shanghai via Ningbo. In recent years, transportation has been difficult due to blockades, and prices have risen sharply. As a result, village women are not as diligent in weaving as before, and goods are scarce and prices are skyrocketing.

### Grains - Rice Prices Fall Slightly - Base Price Already High

Following the continuous surge in the rice market the week before, yesterday was the first day of trading after the holiday. Generally, people felt that it would be difficult to sell because the Mixed Grains Association was implementing a ban on afternoon rice market transactions, so they had all turned weak. Therefore, at the start of the morning market, both large traders and floating speculators sought to sell. However, distributors were observing and did not enter, and the market was temporarily crowded with goods. As they competed to sell, the price decline began. By midday, prices for various types of foreign rice had fallen by more than 1 yuan. As trading became scarcer, the price decline became more severe, falling all the way down until the close without any sign of rebound. As a result, the closing price was about 2 yuan lower than the previous week, with No. 1 Saigon at 88 yuan, falling to 86.5 yuan; No. 2 at 82 yuan to 81.2 jiao; Huojiao at 86 yuan 3 jiao to 86 yuan; No. 2 Siam at 81.5 yuan to 81 yuan; Xiaojiao at 79 yuan to 78 yuan 7 jiao; Micha at 76 yuan to 75.5 yuan; and Sui at 72 yuan to No. 3 at 60 yuan. It is said that contracts for over 100,000 bags of Xiaojiao rice were negotiated before and after, and large Ri Shang Mian An ships can be traded. In addition, it was confirmed yesterday that Dingtai Huahang contracted for 1,000 tons of No. 2 Saigon at a price of 91.5 yuan. It is possible that more contracts will be finalized today and tomorrow. The market is gradually trending downwards with both delivery and contract activity booming. December Xiaojiao was initially priced at 91 yuan, then gradually decreased from 90 yuan 7 jiao to 90 yuan; No. 2 Saigon for December was at 94.5 yuan and 90 yuan, about 2 yuan lower than the current period on Saturday. Total futures trading for the day was 400 tons, and spot trading was 5,000 bags.

A small amount of foreign rice arrived in Shanghai yesterday, totaling 834 bags, shipped from Hong Kong by Jardine Matheson's Tai Sheng, which berthed at Roosevelt Wharf for unloading yesterday morning.

Although the arrival of thick Japonica and other domestic rice was still scarce, the sales market was also sluggish, so prices were difficult to maintain and continued to fall by 1-2 yuan. Kunshan prices: Jianbai Japonica 98 yuan, Qingjiao rice husk 91 yuan, 90 yuan, original bag 94-5 yuan.

Glutinous rice and other goods weakened. Regardless of the wholesale destination, the channels were limited, and large traders continued to sell, so prices also depreciated by half to two yuan. Li Yuan opened at 98 yuan and 96 yuan; Hong Kong yuan was at 87 yuan to 80 yuan.

### Flour Buying Still Active - Wheat Selling Price at 30 Yuan

The flour market was quite active yesterday as it was the beginning of the week, but it was still dominated by foreign flour. It is expected that a ship carrying Australian foreign flour will arrive this week, totaling over 200,000 bags. A significant portion of these goods have already been sold in advance, and local traders are paying attention to absorbing them, so the market is still tight. It was heard that the Zhonglou brand was priced at 20 yuan 05 fen, and reached 10 yuan 02 jiao in the evening market. Hua Niao brand was priced at 20 yuan to 20 yuan 01 jiao, all of which were retracement trades, totaling 15,000-16,000 bags. As for the local factory flour market, there have been no changes. The wholesale price in this street is still 18 yuan, with 8,000+ bags of flat-priced flour being supplied by the two factories respectively. However, there is still less gruel than monks, and all eyes are on foreign flour. It was also heard that the Fufeng Factory may have to shut down due to the temporary inability to supply foreign wheat raw materials.

The wheat market is quite stable. It is still difficult for inland goods to arrive smoothly, and there are rumors that foreign wheat cannot be shipped to Shanghai, which is still under discussion, so sentiment is strong. The selling price of wheat stored in concession warehouses by Chinese factories has reached 30 yuan, and there are no whole batches available for purchase. Currently, Japanese stores are also pricing at 28 yuan. Chinese factories are waiting for the arrival of foreign wheat and are negotiating for continuous wheat supply, but the issue of ship space is still being worked out.

### Coal - Coal Balls Extend Term and Increase Price - Original Price Offered as Much as Possible During the Term

Recently, various newspapers have been reporting that coal balls will increase in price again, but after on-the-spot investigation by reporters, there is a reason for this, but it has not yet been implemented. Because the coal ball factory saw that the incoming price of Hongji coal powder has reached 155 yuan, the cost exceeds the output (the coal ball factory is currently selling at 152 yuan), requesting a price increase to compensate. After Mr. Yun, the representative of Yitaixing, strongly opposed, the extension was postponed to the 11th for another decision. During the term, the old price will still be offered as much as possible (limited to current vehicles, no warehouse receipts will be issued). However, one or two small factories have also mixed chimney ash, coal slag, and inferior powders into the output to reduce costs, causing the coal balls to ignite easily but not burn well. The public association will thoroughly investigate and warn against selling poor quality products under old brands.

### How to Distinguish Good and Bad Coal Balls

--By One

The author's family of four has a fixed quota for coal balls. In the past, one load of old-brand coal balls (100 catties) was enough for 9 days. A few days ago, in order to save money, they bought a load of new-brand goods for 7-8 jiao. When they weighed it at home, the weight was sufficient, but the quality was light. (The family has a wooden bucket, and a full bucket is exactly 100 catties, but this new brand of goods had more left over after filling, which shows that the quality is loose.) When burning, the fire also started quickly. The reporter was delighted that he had recognized a hero, that "the student surpassed the teacher," and that the new brand was better than the old brand. Unexpectedly, things did not go as planned. By the evening of the fifth day, the coal balls were exhausted, almost twice as fast as usual. He was shocked and inquired among the industry. It was said that the goods from small factories (new brands) had to use coal powder (such as Helin powder, Guba powder, and Fulin powder) to reduce costs because of the low market prices. In addition, there were also one or two bad guys who bought "chimney ash" and "coal slag" at low prices - only 20-30 yuan per load - and mixed them in, so that the coal balls were light and ignited easily, like straw fire, which burns quickly and is quickly exhausted. The raw materials for large factory goods (i.e., old-brand coal balls) mostly use Hongji coal powder, so the quality is hard, ignites slowly, and burns well. The method of distinguishing is to try burning 3.5 pounds (about 32-33 pieces) of old-brand coal balls in a stove, which takes 15 minutes to ignite and can burn continuously for more than 5 hours without adding balls, and can boil 5 pots of 10 pounds of water. This is the true old-brand coal ball. Mine extinguished in two or three hours. It's like "buying cheap, eating a hidden loss." There are also one or two stores that are greedy for profit, even though they hang signs saying "old-brand coal balls for sale," but in reality, they are putting up a sheep's head and selling dog meat. It depends on whether the user is wise, researches the facts, and clearly distinguishes between the two.

Editor's Note: What the author said is true, but why is it that the so-called old-brand coal balls purchased directly from a certain large factory are more difficult to light than in the past, and extinguish repeatedly? Firewood is very expensive now, and there are quite a few hidden losses. Is it the small sampan factories upstream and downstream of the New Bridge?

### Silk and Tea

Yesterday's New York silk market: Yokohama spot goods are still maintaining a price of 1350 yuan, futures 1367 yuan, slightly up two yuan from last week. Yesterday, foreign silk shops in this port only saw some success in Hui Jing and others, priced at 2700 yuan. As for dry Jing from Japanese factories, both foreign and domestic sales were quiet.

147 cartons of tea leaves were shipped from Tianjin yesterday.

### Oil Market - Cooking Oil Actually Squeezed

Yesterday, the oil market was completely dominated by bulls. Because Dalian soybean oil had been sold off by the Adjustment Association for more than 7,000 barrels, sentiment was not affected, so futures crude oil showed a squeeze because both spot and inventory were scarce, causing it to counter the short and be unusually lively. Although it was once pulled back due to the market report from Zhou Dao, distant water cannot quench the present thirst, and the market rose sharply again. As a result, the prices were all raised by two yuan. Trades included 50 barrels of Dalian soybean oil, 250 barrels of road goods, 300 loads of Dayou Factory soybean oil, 1200 cans of Jiangbei local workshop butter, 300 pieces of Jiaozhou crude oil, 400 pieces of new goods, 20 barrels of Qingdao crude oil, 1600 barrels for December delivery, and 900 barrels for 200 shares. Yesterday, 450 bags of soybeans came from Quan Jin.

### Dried and Fresh Goods - Hainan Longan Pulp - A Few Customers Release Goods

After Hainan Longan Pulp maintained a price, it eventually failed because of too many goods arriving, and there was no good sign. So, some of the customers couldn't hold on anymore, and yesterday a small number of customers released goods, which was over 10 yuan less than the market. However, most of them were still unwilling to sell.

### Medicinal Materials - Fennel Falls Frequently

Fennel prices have fallen frequently because there is a continued source, and the cost is more favorable. After breaking the 300 yuan barrier, it recently dropped another 20-30 yuan. Yesterday's market was already under 270 yuan, showing a sign of further loosening.

### Financial Review

— Saint-Kai Chiung

— December 7th — Sino-American Financial Cooperation (Continued)

Since 1935, Sino-American financial cooperation before the war consisted of two resolutions. During the war, the stabilization fund of this resolution was the first. The two pre-war resolutions were: the Silver Agreement of May 1936, which stipulated that the United States would purchase 50 million ounces of silver from China at a price of 54 cents per ounce; and the Gold and Silver Exchange Agreement of July 9, 1937. This resolution of cooperation was most critical since the reform of the Chinese monetary system. It not only ended the past Silver Agreement, but also established the foundation for the United States to provide China with economic assistance during the war. The announced content of this agreement includes two points: (1) The Chinese government, in order to increase its gold reserves, and the U.S. government, in accordance with the Silver Purchase Act of 1934, implemented the exchange of gold and silver. (2) The U.S. Treasury Department also plans to expand the previously agreed-upon methods, that is, the conditions under which the Central Bank of China can obtain U.S. exchange to stabilize its currency, while safeguarding the interests of both China and the United States. However, the specific methods of expansion were not announced at that time. It was not until December 19, 1938, when the U.S. Treasury Department officially announced that the Gold and Silver Agreement would continue to be effective after its expiration at the end of the year, that it was revealed that the Central Bank of China, under certain conditions that protect the interests of both China and the United States, could obtain credit loans from the United States by depositing gold in the United States as collateral, in order to facilitate exchange rate stability. The wartime credit loans for goods were all guaranteed by the Central Bank, which stemmed from the monetary agreement of July 1937. As for whether this 50 million stabilization fund came from this agreement, although the authorities have not explained it, it is highly likely in retrospect, because whether the credit loan is for currency or goods, there is no difference in essence in that China obtains U.S. dollar currency. Therefore, although this cooperation between China and the United States to jointly stabilize the legal tender is China's first financial union with the United States during the war, its roots still lie in the maintenance of the legal tender system by China and the United States after the currency reform. This resolution to stabilize the currency is an expansion and evolution of past maintenance measures.

As for the technique of this resolution to stabilize the currency, as stated by the Associated Press in its dispatch on the 2nd regarding the U.S. Treasury Secretary, it is nothing more than engaging in the buying and selling of U.S. dollars and legal tender at a fixed exchange rate. However, the specific exchange rate used as the standard is indeed worth careful consideration. Should it be based on the current price ratio between China and the United States? Or should it be based on the current commercial exchange rate in China? According to what Mr. Moore said: "The Chinese currency has previously fallen sharply, but has recently been quite stable, so in order to improve the internal situation in China, the legal tender should be stabilized." Therefore, using the current commercial exchange rate, which is higher than the black market rate, seems more likely to be adopted as the standard for stabilization. There have been rumors in the Shanghai foreign exchange market that the commercial exchange rate will be changed to 10 U.S. dollars and six pence, which is thought to be based on this view. However, if China and the United States do not have strict measures to manage the foreign exchange market, then maintaining the current higher commercial exchange rate is already unwise. If an excessively high commercial exchange rate is used as the standard for stabilization, the wise financial authorities of China and the United States would probably not do this, because the result would be tantamount to indirectly providing financial assistance to the common enemy of China and the United States, thereby prolonging its aggression. As for isolating the Shanghai exchange market and independently raising the foreign exchange level in free China, it is certainly not the original intention of this Sino-American financial cooperation. It should be known that the Shanghai exchange market and the economic situation of free China have a strong connection in essence, and it is impossible to achieve in reality! Therefore, weighing the gains and losses and calculating the advantages and disadvantages, I am afraid that a variable fixed rate will be set based on the international situation against aggression, and the value of the legal tender will be stabilized!

In short, since the three countries of China, the United States, and the United Kingdom formed an anti-aggression front, the future of the legal tender has long been in a favorable position. The evolution of the Shanghai exchange market since May has already proven this, without the need for me to elaborate. Since the United States assisted the United Kingdom in cracking down on the free British pound on July 18, the anti-aggression financial front has had a preliminary construction, but China has not yet participated. After the Sino-American cooperation to stabilize the legal tender on the 2nd of this month, China, the United States, and the United Kingdom not only formed an anti-aggression front in politics, but also built a solid anti-aggression fortress in finance. In the future, with the support of China's abundant resources and the United States' strong financial resources, the finances of the three countries can avoid the unstable phenomenon of rising and falling prices due to the impact of the war, thereby expanding the anti-aggression forces to combat the establishment of new orders in the Far East and Europe. Then, this new financial cooperation between China and the United States is not only the beginning of the decline of speculators in the Shanghai foreign exchange market and those who use the exchange market for other speculations!

### Price Evaluation of Five Types of Foreign Rice: New Price Limits Implemented Today; First-Grade Tribute Rice at 87 Yuan per Stone; All Rice Market Transactions Must First Pay a Fixed Deposit; Yesterday's Rice Market Stabilization Conference Unanimously Agreed to Establish Public Warehouses

The Public Concession's Bureau of Works and the French Concession's Municipal Council, in view of the recent soaring rice prices and their profound impact on the people's food supply, convened a meeting at the Bureau of Works meeting room yesterday (9th) afternoon at 2 PM. The meeting was jointly hosted by the Bureau of Works and the French Concession's Municipal Council. Yu Qiaqing and representatives from rice industry groups were invited to discuss ways to stabilize the rice market. Representatives from the rice industry groups included Chen Ziyi, Zhu Zixiang, Chen Shide, He Xianggu, Xing Zhigang, and eighteen others. Representatives from the French Concession's Municipal Council were Qi Bai from the Food Committee, Amirinoff from the French Police, and Klose, Ajunian, and Zhu Yigui, five people. Representatives from the Bureau of Works were Deputy Director-General He Kui, and Peterson and Bi Tulai from the Food Committee, three people. The chairman was Deputy Director-General He Kui.

Highest Prices of Five Types of Foreign Rice

The matters discussed included (1) public warehouse rice storage; (2) ordering foreign rice; and (3) stabilizing the rice market. After the meeting, the members of the Evaluation Committee held a meeting at the original venue and evaluated the highest prices for five types of foreign rice. (1) First-grade Saigon, 87 yuan per stone; (2) Second-grade Saigon, 81 yuan 5 jiao per stone; (3) Second-grade Siam, 80 yuan per stone; (4) High-Fire Texture, 86 yuan per stone; and (5) Small Grinding, 79 yuan per stone. The above price limits will be implemented from today (10th).

Public Warehouse Measures

The proceedings of yesterday's meeting included (1) the public warehouse rice storage case. Yu Qiaqing first explained the public warehouse plan and expressed the hope that the rice industry would prepare 60,000 bags of foreign rice, other industries 40,000 bags, the silver and money industry 50,000 bags, and enthusiastic people from society 50,000 bags, totaling 200,000 bags, as the standing reserve grain for the public warehouse. As a result of the discussion, the principles of the above plan were unanimously endorsed. As for the practical and feasible details, the Bean and Rice Industry Association and the Miscellaneous Grain and Oilseed Cake Industry Association will each appoint two representatives to work with Mr. Yu to formulate and implement them. (2) Regarding the ordering of foreign rice, it was resolved that the rice industry should order another 100,000 bags of foreign rice from abroad as soon as possible before the end of this year to increase the Shanghai inventory. Once all orders are placed, they should be reported to the two Bureaus of Works for review.

Rice Grain Transactions Must Pay a Fixed Deposit

(3) Regarding the stabilization of the rice market, according to past practice, rice grain transactions in the rice market have not required advance payment of a fixed deposit. The chairman expressed the opinion that this practice would certainly promote speculative transactions. In the future, rice grain transactions should require advance payment of a fixed deposit. As a result, it was unanimously resolved that from the 12th of this month, all those who purchase rice in the rice market must pay a fixed deposit of 5 yuan per bag on the same day and stipulate that payment and delivery must be made within five days. The rice market will implement this strictly. Furthermore, the current rice price is rising, and speculation should be curbed to stabilize the market. It was then resolved to urge the Food Evaluation Committee to resume work as soon as possible and re-determine the rice price. All rice prices assessed by the committee will be the highest prices and must not be exceeded. If any circumstances exceed the price limit, it will be severely punished according to the law once verified.

French Consul in Contact with Vietnamese Authorities

The English-language "Greater Shanghai Evening Post" reported that important rice merchants in the city consulted with Bureau of Works officials this afternoon (9th) regarding the food supply problem. At the same time, the French Consulate disclosed that French Consul General Magre had contacted the Vietnamese authorities to discuss the shipment of foreign rice to Shanghai. According to Magre, he had contacted the French authorities in Vietnam in the past week to inquire whether Saigon rice would be allowed to be shipped out of Vietnam, but had not yet received a formal reply. Furthermore, according to Bureau of Works officials, it is rumored that the Vietnamese side will not allow the export of first-grade Saigon rice ordered after December 26, but will continue to allow the transport of second-grade and lower rice. The big problem at hand is whether we can obtain ships to carry the rice.

70,000 Bags of Rice to Arrive Tomorrow

At the same time, it is heard that the French ship "Tatanam" carrying about 70,000 bags of Saigon rice will arrive here tomorrow (10th). It is widely believed that the arrival of this batch of rice will temporarily halt the rice price surge. Yesterday (8th), 20,000 bags of foreign rice were also transported here. Observers said that if the Japanese side allows the smooth transport of national rice to Shanghai, the city's rice supply will not be depleted, and there is no fear of a sharp rise in rice prices.

Profit Regulations, Rice Prices Fall

More than a thousand rice stores throughout the city are very uneasy about the failure to stabilize rice prices. After rice prices rise, the cost of procuring rice will also increase, making it difficult to turn over economically. In addition to petitioning the authorities to request that the city's huge rice reserves be sold to the public, they also informed their colleagues that they must abide by the profit of 1.5 yuan per stone according to the market price and must not raise prices. They are also prohibited from mixing in inferior goods to deceive customers. Yesterday, in the rice market, due to the large influx of foreign rice from Hong Kong and Vietnam recently, reaching more than 100,000 stones, and the authorities' determination to sanction speculators, people were generally bearish, and hoarders also dumped large quantities, causing the price of each stone of rice to fall in all grades. It is expected that under the joint sanctions of the authorities and rice industry groups, it will continue to fall.

Form a Subcommittee to Discuss at Length

In yesterday's meeting, there was a saying the night before that the price limit for each bag of Rangoon rice should be set below 96 yuan, and it was decided to investigate and concentrate the Shanghai inventory and order its sale. However, yesterday's meeting did not yield any results. When asked about it from a certain person who attended the meeting, he said that a proper method had not been obtained for the time being, so some suggestions had to be transferred to a subcommittee for discussion. When the committee will be established is still undecided, but it is determined to follow the eager hopes of all parties and establish it in the shortest possible time.

### Bureau of Works Police Detained: Strong Protest to Be Lodged; Major Bowen Has Submitted a Detailed Report; Wounded "Municipal Police" Died from Serious Injuries

On the night before last (8th), one "municipal police" officer in the Western District died in an accident. Five police officers from the Bureau of Works Police Department arrived to investigate and were detained by Japanese military police. The Chief Inspector, Mr. Changshi, was also assaulted and humiliated. Regarding this matter, Major Bowen, Chief of the Bureau of Works Police Department, submitted a formal report to the Bureau yesterday morning (9th). It is heard that the Bureau of Works will lodge a strong protest with the Japanese authorities.

Jumped onto a Truck and Suddenly Fell Off

According to a certain Chinese eyewitness, the incident occurred shortly after 9 PM on the night before last at the corner of Kinnear Road and Edinburgh Road. A "municipal police" officer jumped onto a truck that was moving and suddenly fell off. His brain was shocked. Not long after, an ambulance from the Public Concession Fire Department arrived and took the injured "police" officer away.

Assaulted and Detained the Police Chief

After a while, Public Concession Chief Inspector Changshi and Deputy Chief Inspector Deng Qulai arrived with three Chinese constables. While they were investigating, a team of Japanese military police also arrived, disarmed the Public Concession police officers, and one military police officer slapped Chief Inspector Changshi in the face several times before all of them were escorted to the Western District Japanese Military Police Department at 94 Jessfield Road. After the senior officials of the Bureau of Works Police Department negotiated with the Japanese authorities, they were released at 11:05 PM.

Japanese Side Claims It Was a Misunderstanding

According to what was reported by the Japanese side yesterday, the Japanese military police took this severe action because they heard that a Public Concession police officer had shot and killed a "municipal police" officer. However, official sources refused to comment, saying that they were awaiting a detailed report. As for the injured "police" officer, he was sent to Renji Hospital by ambulance and died from his serious injuries. After the five Public Concession police officers were detained last night, the Japanese authorities immediately blocked off Jessfield Road and did not allow passage until 11 PM, when it was reopened. At the same time, the situation around the Shanghai West blockade zone remained calm yesterday with little change. It has not been possible to obtain information from the Japanese authorities as to when the blockade will be lifted.

Residents of Shanghai West Detour

Since the Japanese side blockaded Shanghai West, it has been ten days. Although three places have been opened, the restrictions are very strict, and residents still feel inconvenienced. A reporter from Da Zhong News Agency toured the area around the blockade zone yesterday and saw that this semi-blockade state continued to exist without any changes. Most of the residents in the area are unwilling to purchase tickets under the bayonets at the entrance of YuYuan Road and Great Western Road to take the so-called "Shanghai West Citizens' Public Bus" and prefer to take a detour. Therefore, the largest number of people enter and exit from Lane 608 of YuYuan Road (namely Qianjia Lane). Furthermore, the business of the British Merchant No. 7 Public Bus is also very prosperous, as it can be taken from Jing'an Temple Road to the intersection of Haig Road and Edinburgh Road and then transferred into the blockade zone. In addition, many people take rickshaws to Kinnear Road and then transfer into Edinburgh Road and YuYuan Road.

### After Allied Nations Lend Large Sums to China, Foreign Exchange Fund Increases; Native Product Exports Double; Efforts Made to Obtain Foreign Exchange; Gold and Silver Exports Are Deposited in British and American Banks

For the sake of economic assistance to China, Britain, America, and the Soviet Union have, in addition to signing barter agreements with China, exchanged China's native products such as tea, tung oil, minerals, and bristles for military and industrial necessities. Despite the international transportation lines being hindered, China's barter agreements with Britain, America, and the Soviet Union have been fulfilled, earning high praise from various countries. Recently, the shipment of Chinese native products to Britain, America, and the Soviet Union via the China-Soviet highway and the Burma Road has increased sharply. In addition, various countries have lent large sums to China. The United States has newly provided US$100 million, Britain has lent £10 million, and the Soviet Union will also provide a large loan to China, which will make China's foreign exchange fund more abundant. The policy of maintaining the stability of the legal tender and foreign exchange will be sustainable and will not collapse. The source of foreign exchange is increasing daily, so why worry about it being exhausted?

Native Product Exports Double Last Year's

After the war, the total value of China's native product exports was 76,264,000 yuan the year before last, 100,272,400 yuan last year, and 162,279,000 yuan from January to October this year. The total value of these exports is equivalent to the same amount of foreign exchange funds, which can be purely obtained by the government. However, the government still needs to provide the exporters who settle foreign exchange with domestic currency as the price of the goods.

Overseas Remittances Comparable to Last Year

According to general estimates, the total amount of remittances from overseas Chinese to their motherland in 1939 exceeded 600 million yuan. As of the end of October this year, the remittances from overseas Chinese to their motherland were 550 million yuan. It is expected that the remittances from overseas Chinese this year will be above 600 million yuan. Moreover, the international exchange network of the Bank of China has been successfully deployed, and preferential measures have been established to reduce exchange rates and facilitate overseas Chinese.

Gold and Silver Concentrated and Deposited Overseas

In 1938, the exported gold and silver amounted to 7,463,165 taels of gold and 80,330,037 yuan of silver. In 1939, the exported gold and silver amounted to 1,393,200 taels of gold and 1,967,697 yuan of silver. As of the end of October this year, the exported gold amounted to 10,131,160 taels of gold and the exported silver amounted to 15,294,640 yuan of silver. These gold and silver are all controlled by the government and transported to countries such as Britain and the United States, or deposited in overseas banks, or exchanged for foreign exchange.

### Nine Japanese Warships Leave Zhenhai; Attempted Landing Unsuccessful; Local Area Heavily Bombed

Haixian County was once captured in July of this year, but was quickly recovered after a fierce counterattack by the Chinese army. However, the urban area suffered severe damage from this calamity. Although order has been restored, various agencies such as the county government have temporarily moved to another location to work. The urban business district is extremely desolate, and the roads are filled with refugees, awaiting widespread relief.

Japanese Planes Form Squadrons for Air Raids and Bombings

Unexpectedly, on the 6th of this month, eight Japanese planes suddenly arrived, divided into two teams. They first circled and scouted Chuanshan, a coastal area of Zhenhai, and then dropped bombs. Subsequently, they flew to places such as Chaiqiao and Daqitou in Zhenhai County, dropping bombs one after another. In total, more than 40 bombs were dropped in the above areas, destroying more than 200 houses and causing more than a dozen casualties. Local electrical equipment was destroyed, resulting in considerable damage.

Covering Fire Fails to Enable Landing

After the Japanese planes bombed, they flew out to sea towards Longshan. Not long after, a Japanese warship anchored off the coast of Chuanshan suddenly removed its gun covers and fired more than 40 shells at the shore. Under the cover of the artillery fire, the Japanese warship secretly launched three motorboats, carrying dozens of soldiers, attempting to land on the embankment of Shuangquangang. However, they were discovered by sentries on the shore, and the defending troops fiercely fired volleys and machine guns, forcing the Japanese warship to retreat.

Japanese Warships and Planes Still Not Gone

When the Japanese warship fired its guns, as many as fifteen Japanese warships were anchored from Dayoushan outside Zhenhai Port to Xiangshan Port, Shipu, and Dongmen Island. They left one after another that evening. According to news from the shipping industry this morning, in addition to the three Japanese warships still anchored at Shipu and Dongmen Island, one anchored at Ligang, and two anchored at Longshan, there were no other Japanese warships on the sea. Also, three Japanese planes scouted over Chuanshan yesterday, but did not drop any bombs.

### Rumor That Hangzhou Bay Blockade Lifted; Still Many Dangers En Route

According to news from the travel industry, the Japanese blockade line in Zhapu Hangzhou Bay has been effectively opened since the 3rd of this month. However, the inspection of passengers traveling to and from is very strict. Since the ports of Zhejiang were blockaded, most merchants traveling to and from have taken the route through Hangzhou Bay. After the area was blockaded by the Japanese, merchants rarely appeared. Although it has now been opened, there have been frequent reports of travelers being injured there several months ago, so it cannot be regarded as a safe route.

### U.S. Gunboat "Guam" Leaves Shanghai for Hankou

The U.S. gunboat "Guam" belonging to the U.S. Yangtze River Fleet, upon orders, left Shanghai at approximately 9:45 yesterday morning and headed for Hankou. The other U.S. gunboat "Oahu" currently stationed in Hankou will depart from Hankou for Shanghai after the gunboat "Guam" arrives there.

### French Consul-General Hosts Banquet for Senior Chinese Officers of the Police Force

French Consul-General M. Mager, in recognition of the diligent service of senior Chinese officers of the French police force, hosted a banquet yesterday at the Police General Association at 47 Avenue des Soeurs. The Chief of the French Police, M. Fabre, invited more than a dozen senior Chinese officers of the French police force, such as Xue Genhua and Zou Chengdong, to the banquet. The atmosphere was very convivial.

### Seventy-Six American Nationals Leave Shanghai by Ship to Return Home; Some Others Have Also Booked Tickets; New Liner of President Company Postponed Arrival in Shanghai

According to sources from the American President Lines, the company's President Cleveland is scheduled to carry seventy-six American nationals from Shanghai tonight (the 10th) and sail to the United States. Most of these seventy-six people are American nationals who are withdrawing from the Far East in accordance with the recommendations of the U.S. State Department, and the rest had already booked tickets. It is reported that the ship will be fully booked when it leaves Yokohama on its return voyage. The President Cleveland, carrying a large number of passengers, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning (the 9th) from Manila and Hong Kong and docked across from the First Water Plant in the Huangpu River. The last passenger ferry left the Customs Wharf at 6:45 p.m.

Jackson Ship Postponed Arrival

The first completed of the new Seven Seas class liners of the American President Lines, the President Jackson, originally scheduled to arrive tomorrow (the 11th), has now been changed to 7:00 a.m. on the 12th, docking at buoys 12 and 13 in the Huangpu River. The ship was launched on June 7th this year at the Newport News shipyard and is circumnavigating the world via Shanghai. Details have been reported previously. It will only stay in Shanghai for one night and leave for Hong Kong, Manila, and various ports in Southeast Asia the day after tomorrow (the 13th), returning to New York via the Cape of Good Hope. There are currently more than ninety passengers. This ship does not carry American nationals returning home from the Far East. The company originally planned to invite people from all walks of life in the city to visit, but later received an order from the head office that due to the extraordinary circumstances, it was inconvenient to hold the event, so it was cancelled.

### Pingmei Reduced Selling Price; Should Be Resolved Soon

The Shanghai Coal Industry Association resells coal at a flat price to cooked water shops. Previously, because the Kai Ao Mining Bureau was invited to increase the selling price from 55 yuan to 75 yuan per ton, the cooked water industry in this city, seeing that the price increase was too large and the responsibility was too heavy, refused to buy it and appealed to the coal industry to reduce the selling price. After Yu Qiaqing and others took on the role of mediators, the Kai Ao Mining Bureau has agreed to consider it. The selling price of Pingmei coal should be resolved in the near future. However, whether the coal industry association will continue to resell it or the cooked water industry will purchase it directly remains to be decided. But the reduction in the selling price of this Pingmei coal can be resolved soon.

### Winter Shelter Nearing Completion; Rushing to Make Winter Clothes

The charity organization Relief Association holds a winter shelter every year. This year, it is still being held as usual, building a straw shed. The location is still at the empty lot of Yan's residence on Difeng Road. More than 20 workers are working there every day, and Lu Deshen and others have been sent by the association to supervise the work. The shed construction will be completed in a few days. Once the internal treatment, bathing, and stall equipment are completed, it can begin to take in and benefit the poor. The association has recently raised more than 200 dan of cotton to be used for sewing winter clothes for the poor. More than a dozen refugees have been engaged in turning out the linings of cotton-padded jackets at the Ci Yuan Shelter on North Zhejiang Road, and more than 100 pieces have already been made, and they are still being rushed out. The association's good deeds of relieving the hidden poor and distributing rice and steamed buns can also be decided upon soon. However, as harsh winter has arrived, it is often seen on the streets and roads these days that people are freezing and starving to death. The funds for various emergency relief projects require quick donations from all sectors.

### Rental Regulations in the French Concession; Consuls Still Studying; Abuses Such as Subleasing Not Eliminated for the Time Being; Municipal Council Continues Discussions with the French Side

The English-language China Press reported that the French Concession Rent Investigation Committee, in order to abolish abuses such as subleasing and the eviction of tenants without cause within the concession, had drafted rental regulations for the French Consulate to approve and implement. The French authorities have sent these regulations to the consular authorities of various countries in Shanghai to inquire whether the governments of those countries believe that these regulations violate their national laws or whether they approve of their implementation by the French police. It is heard that the consular authorities of various countries are still studying them and have not yet replied, so it is expected that the French authorities will not take action to eliminate abuses such as subleasing for the time being. A spokesman for the Municipal Council also said that the council is continuing discussions with the French side, but there has been no indication that the Public Concession will draft similar rental regulations.

Chinese Law Also Has Many Conflicts

The chairman of the Rent Committee of the French Concession of this city drafted a draft of the Real Estate Leasing Regulations and sent it to the members of the committee for study, and then presented it to the French Consul-General for preparation for promulgation and implementation. The full text of the draft has been published in the newspaper. It was recently heard that Mr. Xu Jiashi, a famous lawyer in the city and a member of the committee, believes that the case conflicts with the agreement between the Shanghai French Concession and the Chinese Court established, and with Chinese law in many ways. It infringes on the court's jurisdiction and people's rights, and its meaning tends to protect landlords, allowing landlords to avoid court procedures and directly take back houses. In addition, the houses in the concession are all re-evaluated, and it is bound to increase rents as much as possible, which will only lead to disputes and will not alleviate the housing shortage. He has cited the French Covenant, the Civil Code, the Criminal Code, the Land Law, the regulations to be formulated by France, and the supplementary rules to the regulations for foreigners residing in Shanghai, and submitted a written opinion to the chairman of the committee and the French Consul-General to raise objections.

### Cargo Ship "Greek Merchant" Detained by Japanese; Xin Anli Released; Remaining Six Ships Still Detained

The cargo ship Greek Merchant of the Sino-Greek Shipping Company in this port, which is currently leased to a Hong Kong company to carry coal, sails between Hong Kong and Annam Hongji. Last week, it ran aground somewhere while sailing from Hong Kong. Later, because the tide rose and the ship floated, the bottom of the ship was slightly damaged, so it sailed to Qiongzhoukou on Hainan Island to prepare for repairs. Now, Japan refuses to issue a permit to Hong Kong on the grounds that the ship's nationality is unknown and has detained it. The ship is now operated by a Panamanian merchant, so the Panamanian Consul in Hong Kong is negotiating with the Japanese in the hope that the ship will be released. The Shanghai Sino-Greek Shipping Company has not received any news.

Foreign ships on the Shanghai-Zhejiang line have been blocked in the middle of the journey since the Japanese blockaded the ports. The British ship Xin Anli sailed from Shanghai to Wenzhou at the end of October. Because the Japanese warship prevented it from entering the port, it anchored outside the Oujiang Estuary for a long time. It was once forced to sail to Zhoushan. It is now learned that the ship returned to Shanghai yesterday. All passengers and cargo were returned to the original ship and unloaded at the Sixteenth Wharf.

### Speculative Merchants Risk Transporting Goods; Procuring from the Lower Reaches of the Yangtze River; Thick Profits Can Be Obtained After Arriving in Shanghai

According to the North China Daily News, after the Japanese naval authorities tightened restrictions on coastal shipping, coastal shipping continued to deteriorate, and the high profits of the shipping industry have become a thing of the past. However, in recent months, some Chinese who engage in speculation in this city have purchased large quantities of goods at very low prices in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, entrusting them to barges to transport them, risking the goods being seized or detained, and shipping them to Shanghai. In a single transaction, they can make profits of two or three times. People with inside knowledge of the shipping industry stated that most of the people transporting these goods to Shanghai are merchants from this city, because Chinese merchants in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River are unwilling to transport goods to Shanghai themselves, fearing that the situation in Shanghai will become even worse. They mistakenly believe in the true situation here. For this reason, speculative elements in this city who are greedy for thick profits can almost operate this industry exclusively. There is little demand for local products at the ports in Changdong, so the purchase price is low, but all sales in Shanghai must risk being seized by the Japanese navy, and face difficulties such as prices tending to fall when goods arrive in Shanghai and high freight rates.

### French Electric Company Labor-Management Dispute Completely Resolved; Both Parties Scheduled to Sign Tomorrow

The labor and management of the French Water and Electricity Company signed a labor-management agreement last month. After resuming work, there were still 14 incidental conditions that had not been resolved, so the dispute had not been eliminated. On the 23rd of last month, the workers in the mechanical department even staged a go-slow, which made the situation tense again. However, after both parties negotiated sincerely and repeatedly, most of the unresolved conditions have been agreed upon, with only four remaining unresolved. Yesterday afternoon, the labor and management met again for a final meeting at the Lu Ban Road headquarters. The labor side was attended by six representatives from the mechanical department and the transportation department, while the management side was personally attended by the manager, Fa Feilai.

The fully negotiated conditions have been decided to be signed at 5:00 p.m. tomorrow.

### Master Yinguang's Will; Declines Memorial Service

The Buddhist community in this city, believing that Master Yinguang was a great monk of his generation with profound knowledge, originally planned to initiate a memorial service to show their sorrow. However, in accordance with Master Yinguang's will, with the exception of this temple in Mudu, Suzhou, which will hold a Buddhist ceremony to express its grief, all Buddhist communities in various places will not hold memorial services. They respect the will. Checking the highest prestige in the Buddhist community, there are only Master Yinguang, Master Taixu, and Master Yuanying, but their ambitions are different. After Master Yinguang passed away, only Master Taixu and Master Yuanying were left, which also shows the decline of talent in the Buddhist community.

He also conspired with Tian Xiufeng, a driver of streetcar number 547 of the Yangshang Tram Company, who carried a handgun. Their plan was discovered by Chinese Detective Feng Baishun and Chinese Detective Kong Guangxiao of the Putuo Road police station, who arrested them all. Each was found to be carrying a .32 caliber Browning Spanish-style handgun. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Third Criminal Division of the First Special Court.

Nature

### Armaments of Nature

— Jian Nong

I always thought that among all the new inventions of mankind, there were already masterpieces of nature serving as their models; humans, being more intelligent than other animals, are simply good at imitating and conveniently copying them. Now, I will pick a few examples at random to substantiate my claim.

Paratroopers

In villages, roadsides, ridges, and meadows, almost everywhere, you can see a short, yellow flower with serrated leaves. Its name is dandelion, the same dandelion that scholars and men of letters speak of in "Blue skies, yellow earth" and "Yellow flowers on the outskirts like golden nails." This seemingly humble dandelion, which no one finds rare or admires, possesses an unusually large reproductive capacity because it can adopt the most effective method of colonizing territory, which is the aerial parachute method that people are now familiar with.

Originally, when its seeds mature, a cluster of white, fluffy down emerges from the flower receptacle. Look at how exquisite and orderly the geometric pattern of that down is! It is composed of many brown seeds arranged in order. If you approach and observe carefully, you can see that on top of each seed is tied a small umbrella made of white down. These are the whole team of paratroopers waiting to be dispatched to conquer neighboring lands! They only wait for the wind to blow, and then they rise straight into the air, drifting and swinging, invading everywhere. Wherever they land, they take root and sprout, settle down and establish a career. This territory is of course considered to be conquered by it. Strangely enough, the parachutes that these seeds carry also have the function of "seaplanes." Because if a paratrooper is blown into the water, the small umbrella will immediately curl into a ball, which can carry the paratrooper to land in a suitable place. We can now understand why there are traces of dandelions everywhere.

If the reader is interested, you may wish to find a dandelion down ball in the wilderness or garden: pluck it down, blow it with your mouth, and you can see hundreds of white parachutes dancing one after another. You can be regarded as seeing with your own eyes the battle of the Dutch soldiers a few days ago.

Time Bomb

In the tropical regions of South America, there is a tree called Sablier elastique. Its sap is like milk and is used as a raw material for rubber. Oil can be extracted from the seeds to treat diseases. However, the most strange thing is the way its fruit disseminates seeds: we can really call it a "time bomb." This fruit is larger than a human head, flattened and round in shape, and the outer shell is split into a dozen to twenty segments. We can imagine it being similar to a peeled pomelo. When it is fully ripe, the outer shell becomes dry and shriveled. Relying on a kind of uncontrollable latent force inside it, there is a loud boom, shaking the earth and moving the mountains. It really seems like a bomb has exploded, shooting the fruit segments and seeds to extremely far places. Isn't this a time bomb? Museums that collect it for preservation as a specimen, fearing that it will cause trouble, use iron wires to wrap it tightly. However, even so, it still cannot withstand its sometimes bad temper, blowing up the glass cabinet into powder—

Black Smoke Screen

The guy that makes the smoke screen is an animal that we are relatively familiar with: it is the cuttlefish that we sometimes use to serve with rice and wine! We know that it has an "ink sac" in its belly. When it is chased by enemies, such as when it is about to be swallowed by a large fish, it squirts ink at the eyes of the enemy. Due to the diffusion effect, the ink quickly turns into a cloud of black mist. When the enemy's eyes are blinded by this black mist, the cuttlefish takes the opportunity to escape. Isn't this a very wonderful smoke screen effect?

Tank Trap

There is an insect called Fourmi-lion, which we can translate as "antlion" because its larvae specialize in catching ants as food. The way the larvae catch ants is to dig a funnel-shaped cave in the sandy soil, and it squats at the bottom of the cave patiently waiting. If an ant is walking on the edge of the cave, the mass of this small tank itself will cause the sand on the edge of the cave to collapse, sliding it to the bottom of the cave all at once. The small antlion lying in ambush below can catch it for food. Sometimes, this small antlion sprays a rain of sand from its mouth, making sizzling and popping sounds, as if opening a machine gun and shooting the enemy down from above. This can also be called a flat-shooting gun to hit tanks.

Stinky Poison Gas

Among the animals that release poison gas, the one we are most familiar with is the weasel, whose tail hair can be used to make small regular script brushes, commonly known as the yellow weasel. When it is chased by people or larger animals, it releases an unbearable stench from a gland in its anal sac. Foreigners call this beast the "stink beast", and there is a proverb "the more you kick the stink beast, the stinkier it gets." In the Americas, there is an animal of the same kind called Monfette. The stinky juice in its anus can be shot more than ten feet away. The smell of this thing is so strong that if it is shot into a house, the house can no longer be lived in, and if it is沾to clothes, the clothes can no longer be worn! It is not yet known whether the animals shot by it will be stunk to death, but it would not be an exaggeration to call this thing poison gas.

Self-Cultivation

### The Interpretation of Success

— Zi Lai

No one doesn't want to succeed, but there are really few people who succeed. Because most people do not have firm resolve and lack courage. When they encounter difficulties, they lose heart and become discouraged, abandoning their efforts halfway and refusing to try again. Success is not an easy thing. It often requires several failures and struggles to reach the goal. A misunderstanding of the meaning of success, leading to going down the wrong path, making the goal of success further and further away, is also a reason.

The easiest things for people to associate with success are money and power, thinking that having money or power can be considered success. Therefore, they hoard, manipulate, speculate, gamble, sell their conscience, and compete for power and profit, doing everything to achieve the purpose of "success." In fact, are money and power the weights to measure success? Are high-ranking officials successful people? Einstein was a Jewish refugee expelled by Hitler; Gandhi's entire property was estimated to be worth only seven and a half jiao. But one is the inventor of the theory of relativity, and the other is the leader of the Indian independence movement. But don't misunderstand the relationship between fame and success. Successful people not only do not necessarily enjoy fame, but also suffer great humiliation. Wasn't Socrates sentenced to death? Wasn't Galileo considered rebellious? Columbus discovered the New World, but was insulted as a prisoner, brought back to Spain in chains, and died in disgrace. Even the continent he discovered is not commemorated by his name, but commemorates a cartographer named Amerigo. And fake philanthropists and fake educators with great reputations can be found everywhere. So there is no need to publicize oneself, let alone buy people to praise oneself, deceive the world and steal fame, thinking that it is success.

We understand that grabbing money, grabbing power, and selling fame are not methods to achieve success, because having money, power, and fame does not necessarily mean success, and success does not necessarily mean having money, power, and fame. Only those who increase human happiness are successful people, and only honest and earnest effort is the method to achieve success. Not afraid of difficulties, not afraid of failures, identify the goal, and work hard, there is no way not to succeed; even if you fail, being able to fight to the end is also a success!

### Zhangtai Willow

— Gu Mingdao

The people serving in the front cabin, upon hearing the sound of the cabin boss slapping the table, a fat woman in her fifties, with powder on her face and flowers in her hair, hurriedly stood up and peeked inside. Seeing that everyone's faces were still looking good and they were drinking with each other, she was relieved. The scholar, sitting facing outwards, saw her at a glance and said, "Aunt Xu, bring more wine." Aunt Xu quickly stepped forward, with a flattering smile, and said, "Master Zhang, Jingyuan is here. Do you want to go ashore? Drink less wine, I'm afraid Ying'er and Jiang'er will get drunk." The scholar nodded and said, "Jingyuan is here? We might as well go ashore for a walk." At this time, the boatman had already punted the boat closer to the shore. Suddenly, someone on the shore shouted loudly, "Distinguished guests on the boat, would you like to give us some wine and meat to eat and drink? My stomach is still empty today." The voice was as loud as a bell, deafening. The scholar and the beautiful women in the cabin looked out through the windows and saw a very burly man, wearing an open shirt and holding an iron bowl, standing upright on the river bank under a large willow tree. Although he was a beggar who played the flute and begged, his appearance was strange and different from ordinary beggars. He had a deep knife scar on his forehead, his eyes were bright and piercing, and his beard under his chin was like halberds, like Zhong Kui in those years, shooting out his electric gaze, staring intently at the boat window.

(II) Where did the Warrior Come From?

Jiangzi turned her face away in fear when she saw this burly man and said, "Oh! This man is so frightening?" The beautiful woman, however, paid close attention to him. The boatman on the bow shouted loudly, "You beggar, why are you making such a fuss? Our boat hasn't docked yet, and you're already begging from us. Get out of here quickly, don't annoy our Master Zhang." When the man heard the boatman scolding him, his face changed, his eyes widened, and he said, "I only ask to borrow some wine to drink, I don't beg for money. Whose power are you boatmen relying on to bully people who wander the world? What Master Zhang? I want to see him." Before he finished speaking, he jumped to the bow of the boat. The boat didn't even sway. Such a heavy and large body was as light as nothing. The boatman still didn't know the danger, reached out and pushed the man, trying to push him into the water. Who knew that the man's body was like Mount Tai, motionless. The boatman staggered back two steps, almost tumbling headfirst into the water. The man laughed loudly and said, "You don't know your limits, don't know how to advance or retreat, and are asking for trouble yourself." The scholar and the beautiful woman, watching, came out of the cabin together. The others on the boat, seeing a stubborn beggar coming, still wanted to scold him. The beautiful woman quickly waved her hands at everyone, telling them not to argue with the man. She gently moved her lotus steps, walked over and said, "Warrior, what are you doing on our boat?" When the man saw such a beautiful woman walking gracefully, his fierce aura immediately subsided, and he stood upright and said, "So it's Miss Liu. I haven't had any wine to drink today, and when I saw this painted boat, I knew there were wealthy people out enjoying the spring, so I begged for some leftovers to moisten my parched throat, and I didn't dare to do anything else." The beautiful woman was stunned when she heard the man call her Miss Liu and asked, "Warrior, you don't know me, how do you know my surname is Liu?" (V)

### Impressions of the Young Edison Film - Essay Contest on "Young Edison" - Youth Section

— Third Place Zheng Jiuxiao

Before the main feature "Waterloo Bridge," there was a short film "Servant of Mankind," which presented the great figures in American history: Washington, Lincoln, and the third should have been Edison. It succinctly narrated his life's inventions. The final scene showed four or five children looking up at the great man's portrait, a kind of innocent, bewildered gaze, which filled me with indescribable emotion!

This short film, seen shortly after the premiere of "Young Edison," was clearly meaningful. The impression "Young Edison" gave me, in recollection, is like a lonely sail braving the wind, sailing towards the boundless horizon on a bright sea.

The spirit of science is the spirit of seeking knowledge. Newton once said: "Truth is like the vast ocean spread out before us; all that we do not know. I am but a child picking up shells by the seashore." I believe this is by no means an ostentatious expression of humility, but a sincere confession from someone who studies. In the film, Edison also said something similar: "There are so many, many things I don't know, and these things all amaze me. Look at those grasses, why are they green? Why aren't they purple, or black, or yellow? And when a sound disappears beyond our hearing, where does it go?" "No one really knows." This was his sister's reply, and it's the answer most people would give. It's not only that no one knows, but also that no one even thinks to find out. Edison eventually learned many, many things from the many, many things he didn't know. In 1878, he captured the vanished sound, answering a question of "I don't know."

But the spirit of science is not only about seeking knowledge but also about continuous seeking. There are many people in the world who want to understand all natural phenomena, why should only a few find the answers? In 1879, when he invented the light bulb, he tested the filament nine thousand times before finally succeeding. This spirit of diligent pursuit of knowledge, dedicated and unremitting, provides us, the youth, with such a profound lesson! The meaning of life is continuous learning. In the film, seeing the more than one hundred dishes marked with toxic symbols in the basement laboratory, and the chemistry books bought with the money earned from their sale, it seems to be satirizing our youth's tendency to follow the beaten path, and indolence! It also directly shatters the illusions of those who are slightly clever and dream of being geniuses.

Edison's greatness lies in the fact that he always thought of others first, caring little about himself. In his eighty-five years of life, he invented hundreds of things, all of which were needed by mankind. There was no utilitarian concept mixed into his thinking. What can be seen in the film, and is also a fact, is that when he rescued the stationmaster's son from under a freight car, this courage of self-sacrifice was fully revealed. Also, when his mother had a back ailment and there was not enough light for the operation, he cleverly used the reflection of a mirror to save his mother from danger. At this time, the dimness under the world's stone lamps and the suffering of mothers had already inspired in his young mind the intention to shoulder the responsibilities of mankind. Isn't the brightness of the 20th-century world a result of the warmth in his starry heart?

Among the thousands of films, we are too tired of odes to the love of men and women. This outstanding biopic made me feel a kind of noblest emotion in the world. The reason why Sakyamuni became Buddha and Jesus became Savior, shining on decades of history, is because they both wanted to bear the sorrow of all mankind on their own. The pursuit of truth by scientists and the sacrifice of politicians for doctrines all have the same starting point. Although the times are different and the names are different, this is the noblest sentiment in the world, and there is no ambiguity about it. In two short hours, thanks to his invention of film, I, from a different country and a different era, was left with an impression of the beginning of his great life, to inspire myself.

### British Special Effects War Films

— Rong Tong

It is not surprising that movie theaters in wartime Britain are booming because, in addition to the main feature, there are also tense and exciting war newsreels to watch. For example, naval battles, the triumphs of air force soldiers, the sudden descent of bombs, and the roar of arsenals are all loved by every patriotic citizen. Recently, the British Ministry of Information has specially produced a set of five-minute war short films to encourage national unity against the enemy, and provided them to theaters for additional screenings. Among these many short films, the most wonderful one is "Miss Grant Goes to the Door to Delay the Enemy." The story is quite thrilling – two old maids live in a desolate corner of England. One night, when the air raid sirens blared in the church, they found a dead paratrooper in the garden. At this moment, a British-uniformed officer suddenly knocked on the door, saying that he had lost his way to the aircraft and asked to borrow a map of the city to view. Unexpectedly, Miss Grant had already carefully studied the wartime manual issued by the Intelligence Department. She closely watched the officer's speech, and as a result, she discovered a loophole, proving that he was actually a German. So she unceremoniously picked up the pistol from the dead paratrooper and held him at gunpoint, while the other rode a bicycle out to call for help. The German cunningly asked Miss Grant for a cigarette. Miss Grant granted this request, and he took advantage of her slight negligence and unexpectedly knocked her down. But just as he was about to rush out the door, the local police also arrived at full speed. The main point of the film is: be on guard against enemy paratroopers at all times and everywhere.

Undoubtedly, such films are extremely effective in alerting and training the public. Now the British Ministry of Information is mobilizing the country's outstanding film practitioners – including directors, actors, technicians, etc. – to continue producing such 500-foot-long short films. It is said that the cost of producing each film is only two thousand US dollars, which is almost only one-tenth of the cost of a Hollywood short film. (Translated from TIME)
