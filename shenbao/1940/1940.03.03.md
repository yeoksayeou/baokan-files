### Joint Office of the Four Banks Actively Handles Agricultural Loans; Outline of Measures Submitted to the Executive Yuan for Approval; Priority to Be Given to Provinces in the Rear Area

Chongqing: The Joint Office of the Four Banks recently convened various agricultural loan agencies to discuss unifying organizations, improving efficiency, expanding funds, and actively handling agricultural loans. The proposed measures have been approved by the board of directors of the office and named "(Central Trust Bureau, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Farmers Bank) Agricultural Loan Measures Outline for the 29th Year." It has been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. The content focuses on: (A) striving for universal loan coverage, (B) increasing the amount of loans, (C) simplifying procedures, (D) providing loans even in areas where farmers' organizations have not been established, (E) each bank should actively participate in production guidance, and (F) local party and government agencies should cooperate in investigation, publicity, and advocacy, and the loan projects should be expanded to eight categories: production, supply and marketing, storage and pledge, farmland water conservancy, transportation tools, farmland purchase, and sideline promotion. Priority will be given to the provinces in the rear area, with Sichuan and Kangding as the primary areas. Other provinces will be handled by the Joint Office of the Four Banks at its discretion. The cooperative treasuries originally established by the Agricultural Bank in various places will continue to operate. As for the future allocation of loan funds, the Central Trust Bureau will receive 15%, Bank of China 25%, Bank of Communications 15%, Farmers Bank 35%, and Agricultural Bank 10%. The total amount of loans has already exceeded 100 million yuan in the past, and it can be greatly increased in the future. With the cooperation and mutual assistance of each bank, focusing on rural construction, the benefits will naturally be great. However, how to universally penetrate into rural areas still requires the cooperation of party and government agencies in investigation, publicity, and advocacy. In addition to instructing the Ministry of Finance to approve the measures, the Executive Yuan has also issued orders to the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the governments of Sichuan, Kangding, Guizhou, Yunnan, Shaanxi, and Gansu to comply with and assist in the implementation.

Editorial

### American Diplomacy and European Peace

The two major continents of Europe and Asia are engaged in wars that are destroying culture and slaughtering humanity. Almost all major countries are directly involved in the war. Only Italy and the United States are able to remain neutral and stand outside the vortex of the war. However, Italy and the United States are inevitably affected by the war in all aspects, including politics, diplomacy, and military affairs. Being called neutral does not mean being isolated and able to take care of oneself!

The two sets of wars in Europe clearly have different developments. The war between Britain, France, and Germany has lasted for six months, but apart from naval submarine activities, encounters between aircraft and reconnaissance teams, and small-scale artillery battles, there has not been a single decent battle to date. The Soviet-Finnish war is more intense. The Red Army, relying on its sophisticated military equipment, is fiercely attacking. Although Finland has favorable weather and terrain and can mount a strong resistance, its national strength is limited. If it cannot obtain external assistance, it may be difficult to resist the Soviet Union's aggression and maintain national independence. So far, these two sets of wars seem to be fought separately and not conspiring with each other. In fact, their related relationships are closely connected. Especially after Germany and the Soviet Union signed a trade agreement recently, the actual cooperation between the two countries is close and subtle, and it cannot be explained by superficial appearances. Therefore, the evolution of the European war may lead to new dramatic changes and create new situations at any time. However, modern warfare is three-dimensional warfare. The complexity of various forces and conditions makes the space vast and the time prolonged. It is by no means possible to immediately determine who wins and who loses with three or five straightforward battles. Therefore, historical knowledge and lessons alone are not enough to predict the future of this European war. Not to mention the results of the war, not to mention martial arts, not to mention the impact of gains and losses, there is no way to estimate them in advance. Even in terms of the duration, there is no way to foresee how long it will last. What can be asserted is that if it is left to military evolution alone, it will not be resolved in a short time. In order to seize the opportunity to win in a long-term war, the belligerent countries are doing everything possible to seek abundant resources to the point of being inexhaustible. Therefore, in addition to intensifying their military actions, the current belligerent countries are also working hard to improve their economic structures and increase their general strength in order to adapt to the needs of a long-term war. At the same time, they are doing their best in diplomacy, wooing allied countries in the hope of protecting their operations and winning victories from the flanks, and even obtaining supplies of resources from other countries from the front. The United States is the actual leader among capitalist countries and possesses great economic power sufficient to influence the world situation. If the European belligerent countries obtain the support of the United States in terms of resources, they will almost have grasped the absolute advantage of winning, or at least have obtained more opportunities to win. The problem is that the United States is not a soulless tool. It has likes and dislikes towards both sides of the belligerent countries, and it is not a blind, religious-style partiality. It also has its own interests, which must be measured by extraordinarily complex conditions. Therefore, the future diplomatic trends of the United States will inevitably have a major impact on the evolution of the European situation, and may even have a final decisive impact!

The United States' enthusiasm for peace and its efforts to safeguard democracy are deeply understood and recognized by everyone except for madmen. Its steady, firm, and strong diplomatic actions are also seen and heard by everyone who is not crazy. We understand these two points. If we base it on historical knowledge and lessons, it seems easy to determine the attitude and ultimate trend of the United States towards the current European war. In the early stages of the last European war, the United States maintained a neutral position. Later, it eventually joined the Allied Powers, thus determining the fate of German militarism. Although the situation this time is different from the division of friends and enemies in 1914, and it is also different from the early stages of the last European war, the various basic tones, whether emotional, beliefs, or reason and interests, are generally not much different from the past. The difference that we cannot ignore the most is that although history seems to be cyclical, it is not a replay. The lessons of the past are painful, and human reason is progressing. This is true for the belligerent countries Britain, France, Germany, and the Soviet Union, and even more so for the neutral United States. Because of this difference, there is a vastly different performance now compared to the last European war. For example, recently, the United States, with its belief in peace, its neutral status, and the weight of its magnificent resources as an international voice, resolutely adopted active diplomatic actions towards the European war. There are two aspects to the action: first, U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles traveled to Europe on the 17th of last month and will visit the authorities of Britain, France, Germany, and Italy one after another. He has now left Mussolini and is going to meet Hitler. Second, Secretary of State Hull stated that he would hold talks with neutral countries to jointly discuss "the establishment of a sound international economic system" and "the reduction of armaments." It is now proceeding calmly and cautiously. These two actions have different directions and different targets. The content and scope are also different. However, their spirit and motivation are naturally the same as their embryos, and the plans and steps are naturally the same as their categories, and the desired effects are naturally the same as their destinations. It goes without saying that President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull are strategizing, issuing instructions, and making decisions. Special Envoy Welles is also one of the few talents in the United States with political acumen and diplomatic skills, and is known for his familiarity with the international situation and is highly valued by President Roosevelt. This mission to go abroad to Europe will surely obtain true insights into the overall world situation as a solid basis for the United States to mediate the European war. Roosevelt warned the American people not to expect too much from Welles' trip. This is the passion revealed by an experienced and prudent statesman, and it cannot diminish our perception of Welles' mission. Of course, we should not think that Welles' trip will be able to reverse the situation, but if the United States does not stay out of it, it will be a major factor in stabilizing the international situation no matter what!

### French Authorities Indicate No Intention to Renew Trade Agreement with Japan; Bombing of Yunnan-Vietnam Railway Arouses French Public Outrage; Industry Worries About Future of Trade with France

Tokyo: According to Japanese sources, although the Japanese Ambassador to France, Sawada, is continuing negotiations with the French Foreign Ministry, the French authorities have indicated that they have no intention of renewing the Franco-Japanese trade agreement. Japanese people here believe that this attitude of the French side is due to the following two factors: (1) Since the outbreak of the European war, France has felt the need to fundamentally adjust its overseas trade relations; (2) French public sentiment has been angered by Japan's bombing of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, and the French government has been swayed by this public opinion. Japanese business circles say that France is trying to get closer to Britain in economic relations and adjust the economic system of Britain and France on the basis of a group. It is reported that France is now working hard to jointly establish self-sufficiency between its country and its colonies with Britain in terms of trade relations. A license system is being implemented for goods imported into British Congo and French Morocco. Japanese cotton fabrics have actually been banned from being exported to all parts of Africa mentioned above. The railway government also plans to strengthen its restrictions on exports in order to reserve raw materials for its munitions industry. However, because the main goods that Japan exports to France and its colonies are canned salmon and textiles, both of which are important daily necessities for Japan, it is difficult for the French to implement severe restrictions. At the same time, the French side seems to be seeking to avoid preventing the export of various raw materials to Japan without reason, so as not to cause retaliatory measures from the Japanese side. (2nd Reuters Dispatch)

Tokyo: Japanese political circles are quite worried about the fate of the Franco-Japanese trade agreement in the future, and they are deeply afraid that it will fall into a state of nothingness like the relations between the United States and Japan. The Franco-Japanese trade agreement will expire on March 15. After the expiration, the French side may refuse to renew it. Since the outbreak of the European war, France has felt the need to readjust its foreign trade relations. Furthermore, since Japan has repeatedly bombed the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, French public opinion has also been quite indignant. (2nd United Press Dispatch)

Paris: According to hints from responsible parties, if Japan attempts to prevent goods from being transported into China via the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, the Allied Powers will protest against Japan's use of the Siberian Railway to transport goods into Germany. It is reported that the goods transported from Japan's Shanxi Siberia Railway to Germany include high-grade steel, cotton cloth, and food. (2nd Reuters Dispatch)

### Japan Plans to Send Hirota to China to Serve as Special Envoy to the "Puppet Regime"

Tokyo: According to the "Hochi Shimbun," former Japanese Prime Minister Hirota Koki is the most likely candidate for the Japanese ambassador when the Wang regime is established in Nanjing. The Japanese government originally planned to send a military man as the first ambassador to the Wang regime, but the plan was abandoned due to "obstacles." Konoe Fumimaro, Hiranuma Kiichiro, and Matsuoka Yosuke were also candidates for "Ambassador to China," but they "cannot accept this post." "The special envoy sent to China will not only carry the government's congratulations to the "Wang regime," but he will also be authorized with broad powers to adjust the main relations between the "new regime" and Japan. Sending a special envoy to the "new regime" is Japan's de facto recognition of the "new regime," which is the same as the dispatch of General Muto Nobuyoshi as a special envoy when "Manchukuo" was established.

### U.S. Export-Import Bank Allocates Huge Sums to Lend to Finland, Sweden, and Norway; Loans to China Will Also Be Implemented Soon

Washington: U.S. Construction Bank Chairman Jones announced yesterday that the Export-Import Bank's board of directors has issued 20 million U.S. dollars to Finland, 15 million U.S. dollars to Sweden, and 10 million U.S. dollars to Norway to purchase various goods other than military supplies within the United States. It is generally expected that the bank will allocate 20 million U.S. dollars to lend to China. Jones received a wireless telegraph from President Roosevelt on the cruiser "Tuscaloosa," guaranteeing that he would sign the bill passed by both houses of Congress to increase the Export-Import Bank's capital by 100 million U.S. dollars when he returned to the White House today.

### Chongqing Actively Evacuates Population

Chongqing: As the Spring Festival is approaching and visibility is clear, in order to avoid unnecessary loss of life and property due to Japanese air raids, the authorities are currently evacuating Chongqing residents on a large scale. The Chongqing Defense Command stipulates that the following must leave the city: a number of government offices, many entertainment venues, and all schools. With the closure of public entertainment venues, which has reduced the vitality of the city, the evacuation process is easier to implement. The evacuation of government agencies is divided into three phases. Those belonging to the first phase have already been moved out. Many other agencies will move out soon. The authorities are also urging shops to transport some of their goods to neighboring towns in order to reduce losses during bombing. Although the air raid shelters here can accommodate 200,000 people, the Defense Command still intends to reduce the population to between 80,000 and 100,000 as much as possible. Therefore, Chongqing is expected to become an uninteresting city in the short term, and the theaters, movie theaters, brothels, and Western-style restaurants that have been ordered to close will all be reduced. (2nd Chongqing Dispatch)

Chongqing: According to news here today, in order to facilitate the evacuation of Chongqing residents as soon as possible, the municipal government authorities here plan to close all theaters, movie theaters, teahouses, brothels, restaurants, and places that only provide unnecessary consumption and entertainment, believing that this is the only effective way to evacuate civilians. Currently, one of the three movie theaters in Chongqing has already been closed. (2nd United Press Dispatch)

### Secret Organizations in Sichuan Form "National Strength Association"

Chongqing: According to the Ta Kung Pao today, sixteen secret organizations in Sichuan have now united to become one organization, named the "National Strength Association," to openly engage in anti-Japanese activities. They held an inaugural meeting here yesterday. From now on, the secret organizations have abandoned their underground secret lives and become open民间团体. It is reported that all members of these sixteen secret organizations reach 7 million people. It is also reported that all secret organization members in China, including men and women, number no less than 20 million. They are roughly divided into three factions: the Red Gang, the Green Gang, and the Red Spear Society. They have a history of several centuries in China and have always engaged in anti-Manchu revolutionary activities during the Manchu Qing Dynasty. (2nd United Press Dispatch)

### The Four Nations of England, America, France, and the Soviet Union Will Certainly Continue to Assist China. The Gathering of the Four Ambassadors in Chongqing is Not Purely Coincidental. Is There Hope for Justice to Prevail? - Editorial from the Central Daily News

Chongqing - The Central Daily News editorial, titled "The Four Ambassadors in Chongqing," expressed confidence that the four nations of England, America, France, and the Soviet Union will undoubtedly continue to provide assistance and sympathy to China. It stated that during this period of resistance, China has only one enemy, with all others being friendly nations. Among these friendly nations, England, America, France, and the Soviet Union are providing the most profound sympathy and assistance to China, which is hardly questionable. British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, French Ambassador Cosme, and Soviet Ambassador Pan Youxin are already in Chongqing, and now American Ambassador Johnson has also arrived. This is the first time all four ambassadors have been in Chongqing simultaneously during China's resistance. England is an empire with interests spanning the globe. At this time of China's resistance, turmoil in Europe has significantly impacted British activities in the Far East. However, British policy, except for occasional excessive caution, consistently supports justice and the Nine-Power Treaty as a whole, which is commendable. Before and after the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, England provided China with valuable assistance. We firmly believe that were it not for the European conflicts, British assistance to China would undoubtedly be far greater than it is today. Eden once stated that British assistance to China could proceed in step with the United States. We firmly believe that this statement remains the policy of the current British government. France is also a signatory to the Nine-Power Treaty. Its strength and influence in the Far East may not match those of England, America, and the Soviet Union, but France's sympathy for China and its support for international justice and the Nine-Power Treaty are in no way inferior to other nations. France is committed to maintaining justice and peace in Europe and also to maintaining justice and peace in the Far East. The Soviet Union, as China's neighbor and also a strong Asian power, plays a crucial role in this Sino-Japanese war. Although the Soviet Union has strived to adhere to a policy of peace in recent years, it has not adopted a policy of indifference towards the Sino-Japanese War. It has shown sympathy for China and, for the sake of justice, has also provided assistance. The Soviet Union's sympathy for China and its opposition to those who seek dominance in the Far East will undoubtedly not change. As for the United States, it is the initiator of the Nine-Power Treaty. American public opinion, which supports justice, is strong and influential, and the relationship between the Chinese and American people has always been friendly. Although the United States does not wish to be drawn into the vortex of war, it will certainly not allow Japanese militarists to control Asia and destroy the policy that the United States has followed in the Far East for fifty years. The profound friendship and assistance of the United States are deeply appreciated by the Chinese people. We firmly believe that once the opportunity arises, the United States' policy of opposing aggression in the Far East will take another step forward. Today, after thirty-two months of resistance, the ambassadors of the four nations that provide China with the greatest assistance are all gathered in Chongqing. This may seem like a coincidence, but it should not be viewed as purely accidental. When the Sino-Japanese War broke out, Japanese militarists boasted that they would end the war within three to four months, but after thirty-two months of fighting, Japan is not only unable to conquer China but also lacks the strength to end the war. The Japanese insist on overthrowing the Chinese National Government, but they are unable to do so militarily or diplomatically. Therefore, the gathering of the four ambassadors in Chongqing today is no accident. Is there hope for justice to prevail? (Reuter's dispatch on the 2nd)

Chongqing - According to reliable sources, the press reports regarding the remarks made by French Ambassador Cosme when the China National Foreign Affairs Association hosted him on January 4th of this year, and the remarks made by the French Consul, who represented the French Ambassador at the opening of the second annual meeting of the Sino-French-Belgian-Swiss Cultural Association on February 25th of this year, both contain errors. Regarding the French Ambassador's remarks on January 4th, the press reported that the French Ambassador stated that China's position in this war between the two sides was the same as that of France. In reality, the French Ambassador only said that France, like China, has now experienced the horrors of war, and therefore hopes that 1940 will be a year of peace for both China and France, and hopes that China will soon realize the happiness and prosperity it deserves. Regarding the French Consul's remarks, the press reported that the Consul stated that China and France stood on an equal footing and that mutual cooperation was necessary for resisting aggression. The French Consul denied this, saying that he only expressed the wish that the cultural relations between China and France should be as close as possible within the realm of possibility.

### Military Affairs Commission Announces Weekly War Situation from February 24th to March 1st

Chongqing - The spokesperson for the Military Affairs Commission stated that since this week (February 24th to March 1st), the Chinese armies in various theaters have launched fierce attacks, inflicting heavy casualties on the Japanese army. Especially in southern Guangxi and the border region of Anhui and Jiangsu, large portions of the Japanese army have been dealt fatal blows by the Chinese army and have fallen into a state of disarray. The Chinese army is currently advancing smoothly. The important aspects of the combat operations are summarized as follows:

Southern Guangxi: The remaining Japanese troops at Gaofeng'ao on the Yongwu Road are still being besieged and annihilated by the Chinese. On the morning of the 24th, more than 3,000 Japanese infantry and cavalry, along with multiple tanks, reinforced from Santang towards the north on the Yongbin Road. Because the 4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th Tangs have been firmly held by the Chinese, the Japanese dare not attempt to bypass them on either side. The Chinese army used predetermined annihilation tactics to encircle them. After three days and nights of piecemeal annihilation and concerted attacks, the Japanese army completely collapsed. On the night of the 26th, they retreated southward in two routes, leaving behind over 1,500 bodies and more than ten tanks, as well as multiple artillery pieces. On the 27th, they retreated to the vicinity of Santang, where the Chinese army pursued them vigorously, annihilating the remaining Japanese troops. On the Yongqin line, the Chinese army took advantage of the situation to recapture Lu Min, Xianbi, Nayuan, Lu Yishiling, Jiujiangzhen, Naping, and other strongholds, and also defeated the Japanese troops that were wreaking havoc near Shangsi, cutting off their retreat route. The Japanese army is extremely panicked.

Border Region of Anhui and Jiangsu: In order to eliminate the threat posed by the Chinese army to Nanjing, the Japanese army gathered troops and advanced towards Fanchang, Langxi, and Aoyang in multiple routes. After the Chinese army maneuvered and launched attacks, they lured the Japanese into their encirclement and dealt them a heavy blow. Fanchang and Langxi were successively recovered, and the Chinese army continued to capture Songlinkou, Majiaba, Dongwan, Ren Village, and other strongholds. The Japanese troops that invaded Liyang were mostly annihilated by the Chinese defenders when they advanced to the vicinity of Nanduzhen. A small number of surviving Japanese troops retreated. At the same time, a Chinese elite force launched a surprise attack on the Japanese rear communication lines, and the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway has been unable to operate for several days. In total, several thousand Japanese troops were killed in this campaign, completely thwarting their attempt to launch an offensive. The Japanese troops besieged in Nanjing are now under the absolute control of the Chinese army.

Shanxi Province: The Japanese troops have become a spent force. In the past week, the Japanese army has not dared to launch any offensive actions. The Chinese army has launched extensive maneuvering tactics, attacking important strongholds such as Baodian, Zhangdianzhen, Xia County, Fushan, Quwo, and Pan County, inflicting heavy casualties. The Chinese army even broke into Changzi city once, leaving the Japanese army at a loss and utterly terrified.

Northern Henan: The Chinese army is pressing towards Qinyang and once recovered Jiaozuo. The Japanese army is struggling to cope. The Chinese army in southern Henan has repeatedly inflicted casualties on the Japanese army at Chushandian and Youhe, and also broke into the south gate of Xinyang, inflicting heavy casualties. On the 24th, the Japanese army gathered reinforcements and launched an offensive towards the vicinity of Luoshan. After being encircled and severely attacked by the Chinese army, the Japanese army was completely annihilated by noon on the 26th, leaving behind over 760 bodies. The Chinese army took advantage of the victory to advance and again approached the outskirts of Xinyang. The city has been in chaos for days, exposing its desperate and exhausted state.

Northern Hubei: Since the recovery of important strongholds such as Pingba, Luoyangdian, Yujiadian, and Dushan, the morale of the Japanese army has been in disarray. The Japanese army has been redeploying troops east and west, attempting to counterattack, but all attempts have been defeated. The Chinese armies in various routes advanced, thoroughly destroying the Japanese rear communication lines, and launched group attacks on the western suburbs of Maping, Youshan, and the southern suburbs of Suixian. The battle situation in northern Hubei is now completely under the control of the Chinese army.

Northern Hunan: The Chinese army has been extremely active in the Japanese rear, destroying the communication lines at Yanglousi, Zhongfang, and Taolin, and recovering various strongholds near Yueyang. The Japanese army has been rendered immobile.

Northern Jiangxi: The Chinese army recovered Gou Xingshan, pressed towards Xishan, besieged Wubucheng, and launched a fierce attack on Changshan, leaving the exhausted Japanese army unable to defend everywhere.

In addition, the Japanese troops besieged in Wuyuan, western Suiyuan, are still being severely attacked by the Chinese. The important stronghold of Bazibulong on the Wuzhai-Huawu Road has been captured, and the Chinese army continues to advance towards Baotou. In northern Chahar, the Chinese army launched a fierce attack on Kangbao, killing countless Japanese officers and soldiers. On the northern bank of the Daqing River in Hebei, there have been days of bloody battles, with the Japanese suffering extremely heavy casualties. The Japanese troops in Beijing and Tianjin feel greatly threatened. In Guangdong Province, the Chinese army recovered Chenghai, broke into Xinhui and Guanyao, and besieged Zengcheng, causing the Japanese army to collapse on all fronts. The Chinese army in Jilin has been active in the snowy terrain for the past month, achieving repeated victories, killing over 3,000 Japanese troops and seizing thirty to forty artillery pieces, and thousands of rifles and machine guns in Changchun and Shixian, causing unrest in the Japanese rear base. In the areas of Zhide, Tongling, and Digang in southern Anhui, over twenty Japanese warships have been sunk or damaged by the Chinese army in the past week. Japanese transportation on the Yangtze River has become impossible. These battles should be specifically reported. (Dispatch on the 2nd)

### Hitler Receives Welles, Engages in Lengthy Conversation, Germany Presents No Peace Plan

Berlin - At 11:15 this morning, Hitler received Welles, with the Italian Ambassador to Germany, Signor Attolico, accompanying Welles in his audience with the head of state. German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and government officials Goschnar and Brockner were also in attendance during Hitler's reception of Welles. (Haitong Telegraph on the 2nd)

Berlin - An official announcement this morning stated that Head of State Hitler received Welles and the American Chargé d'Affaires to Germany, Kirk, this morning, engaging in a lengthy conversation. Foreign Minister Ribbentrop was also present. When Welles arrived at and departed from the chancellery, honor guards presented arms. (Haitong Telegraph on the 2nd)

Berlin - U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles paid a courtesy visit yesterday to Weizsäcker, the Undersecretary of the German Foreign Office, and also held talks with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, lasting for one hour. Neither side has released the contents of the talks. Welles stated, "This conversation was quite interesting." The German side stated that, in accordance with President Roosevelt's wishes, the contents of the talks will not be released for the time being. It is known that Ribbentrop and Welles met and spoke in German, with Dr. Schmidt, a language expert from the Foreign Office, serving as the interpreter. Since the outbreak of the European war, Ribbentrop has only used German during this diplomatic meeting. Regarding President Roosevelt's letter, Welles declined to answer questions, only saying that the letter from Roosevelt to Mussolini "has given rise to various misconceptions." Political figures believe that if President Roosevelt also has a letter for Head of State Hitler, Welles will present it to Hitler in person at this afternoon's audience. Because Welles does not wish to hold ceremonies inappropriate for wartime, there will be no formal banquet. Ribbentrop will hold an informal banquet at his private residence in Dahlem to host Welles. U.S. Chargé d'Affaires to Germany, Kirk, will also host a banquet for Welles at his residence near Grunewald, inviting embassy staff to attend. Kirk is scheduled to hold a tea party at his residence today to give American expatriates the opportunity to meet Welles. General Göring may host Welles at a hunting lodge on the northern outskirts of Berlin, but this has not yet been confirmed. It is generally believed that Welles will leave Berlin on the morning of the 4th. (Haitong Telegraph on the 2nd)

Berlin - Responsible political figures here pointed out that U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles' arrival in Berlin yesterday coincided with the half-year anniversary of the German invasion of Poland. Welles is scheduled to leave Germany the day after tomorrow, his departure coinciding with the half-year anniversary of the declaration of war by England and France. The situation in the past six months is as follows: (1) Military Situation: German officials declare that Germany is currently only fighting on one front. The "blitzkrieg" against Poland did not result in any significant losses in manpower or material resources. On the contrary, Germany acquired a large amount of military spoils. The claim propagated by British and French newspapers that Germany lacks sufficient reserve forces has been proven inaccurate by the facts. The power of German weaponry has not only been demonstrated in the Polish war but also in the naval and air battles on the Western Front. The German Navy today not only controls the Baltic Sea but also a large part of the North Sea, and the superiority of the German Air Force is undeniable. The success of the German submarine warfare can be seen in the tonnage of enemy and neutral ships sunk. According to reliable reports, a total of 1.8 million tons of enemy and neutral ships have been sunk. (2) Political Situation: German officials point out that Germany's relations with the Soviet Union and Italy have been strengthened, and Romania's attitude is also reliable. Britain's policies in Southeastern and Northern Europe have failed because the Balkan and Scandinavian countries are unwilling to join the war. As for Turkey, although it has a mutual assistance pact with England and France, its reservations regarding Russia have greatly diminished the effectiveness of the pact. (3) Economic Situation: The impact of the Anglo-French blockade policy on Germany is not as severe as England and France had anticipated. Although Germany has lost some overseas trade, the large amount of food imported from Eastern Europe as a result of German-Russian cooperation has made up for it. Therefore, three important facts cannot be ignored: (1) Germany today has a population of 95 million; (2) The occupied territory of Poland has 14 million people who are under the rule of German Governor-General Frank and do not adopt a hostile attitude towards Germany; (3) German trade with Russia will reach 1.5 billion marks in value each year. In summary, the situation in the past six months has been very favorable to Germany and is believed that it will continue to be so. (Haitong Telegraph on the 2nd)

Berlin - Political observers here say that Hitler will likely propose Germany's "minimum conditions" for an armistice during his conversation with Welles. It is also rumored that after Welles reports the results of the meeting to Washington, Hitler may convene the Reichstag and deliver an important speech. In this speech, Hitler may reveal the content of his conversation with President Roosevelt's representative. It is also reported that German leaders seem to be doing their utmost to make Welles understand their sincerity in seeking peace, as they know that only by clearly presenting Germany's reasons for fighting this time can they restore diplomatic relations with the United States and possibly change America's attitude towards the current European war and future peace. (United Press on the 2nd)

Berlin - Someone hinted that Welles will meet with another important German figure, namely Hitler's party representative Hess, before leaving Germany. It is also heard that the meeting between Hitler and Welles lasted from 11:15 a.m. to 12:35 p.m. today. Welles returned to the embassy to rest after leaving. It is also learned that German Foreign Ministry Undersecretary Weizsäcker will host a banquet for Welles tonight, inviting External Intelligence Director Schmidt and Propaganda Department Intelligence Office Director Buchmer to attend. (United Press on the 2nd)

German Side Explains Its Stance

Berlin - According to U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles, who spoke to American reporters yesterday, his conversation with the German Foreign Minister was "extremely interesting." Welles also said, "The German government has treated me extremely well on this trip. I hope to visit Aviation Minister Göring as soon as possible and then go to Paris and London." Welles also sent a detailed report to Washington after his conversation with the German Foreign Minister. It is heard that Welles has obtained explanations on several issues. Although Welles' conversation with the German Foreign Minister was kept secret, the German Foreign Ministry has explained to Welles Germany's attitude towards war and peace. It is said that the two sides discussed the following points at the time: (1) Germany does not intend to end the war if it only restores the situation as it was in September of last year. Germany demands equality with Britain and a right to exist; (2) Germany believes that Britain has maintained its hegemonic position in the world for too long; (3) Germany believes that Germany should have the same influence in Europe as the United States has in the Americas; (4) Since England and France are attempting to maintain their advantage by force, Germany believes that there is no hope for peace. This peace must be based on the recognition that Germany has equal rights to enjoy raw materials and markets. (United Press on the 2nd)

Germany Spreads Peace Rumors Again

Berlin - According to the "German Political Report," political figures here claim that reports abroad of German peace plans are purely speculative. Germany has no intention of presenting a peace plan. Germany's diplomatic path is clear, reasonable, and without concealment. At the end of the Polish war, Head of State Hitler put forward a far-sighted and tolerant proposal to restore peace in Europe. At that time, Western European countries were still optimistic about the future of the war and rejected this proposal. Currently, Western European countries, due to the failure of the blockade policy and the refusal of neutral countries to participate in the war, are no longer as optimistic about the future of the war as before. The German government has no reason to make new proposals at this time. Head of State Hitler already raised the question of "War or Peace?" last October. Western European countries, violating the interests of their own people and the interests of all European countries, chose war. Germany has accepted the challenge. This situation has not changed. (Haitong Lightning on the 2nd)

Berlin - Regarding the British report that the German Minister to Ireland contacted the British Marquess of Tavistock and presented some tentative peace proposals to him, the German authorities have solemnly denied it, insisting that the rumor is completely fabricated. The "Hamburger Fremdenblatt" Berlin correspondent also stated that Head of State Hitler had already announced in a speech that Germany today has only one path, namely to continue the war by all means until victory is achieved. (Haitong Telegraph on the 2nd)

American Newspaper Criticizes German Viewpoint

New York - The New York Times today published a war article discussing Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's conversation with Welles. The article's key point was, "If Ribbentrop means that England seized the best things on earth during a time of peace and normalcy, to the detriment of other countries, then his words are absurd. In a time of peace, England's reserves are available for merchants of all countries to purchase, and the prices charged are the same as those paid by British merchants." The article also mentioned Germany's economic difficulties, saying, "Germans have shaken the confidence of foreign countries with endless threats of war, and have shaken the markets upon which their trade depends. Germans govern their own country, disregarding the standards of civilized behavior, and the feelings of foreign countries are turning against Germany, and Germany's markets are being lost." "Ribbentrop talks about England strangling the economic position of the world, but he should not forget that Hitler has strangled most of the world's goodwill." (Reuters dispatch on the 1st)

### Göring Returns to Berlin from the Front Lines

Berlin - German Aviation Minister General Göring left the capital a week ago to inspect the North Sea area and front-line air force bases. He has now completed his official duties and returned here today. General Göring had a very good impression on this trip. He represented Head of State Hitler in awarding the Iron Cross to several officers and non-commissioned officers. While General Göring was at the front, he summoned the generals, listened to reports, and discussed transportation issues with railway officials. (Haitong Telegraph on the 2nd)

London - According to Reuters, news has reached London that German planes have launched fierce attacks at sea. However, warships and escorted merchant ships sustained no damage. British fighter planes ascended to intercept, but did not make contact with the German planes. Fishermen arriving in Scarborough reported that two German planes approached them in the dim light this morning. Before the fishing boats could extinguish their lights, the planes opened fire with machine guns. This morning at 6:00 AM, loud cannon fire was heard in the Panwick area. Residents throughout the city were awakened from their sleep and looked towards the coast, believing a major naval battle was taking place. According to news from Dunbar, heavy cannon fire was heard throughout the night. Panwick officials claimed the cannon fire seemed to be exchanged between that location and the Firth of Forth for an hour. It is widely believed that ships were attacked. Air defense lookouts in the area reported seeing flashes of cannon fire at sea, but the darkness prevented them from determining the number of ships involved. This morning at 4:00 AM, explosions were also heard near the Northumberland coast, possibly from German planes attacking ships several miles offshore. British fighter planes were dispatched on patrol and returned around 9:00 AM. (Reuters, 2nd)

### Secrets of Magnetic Mines - Discovery Process

London - The story of how British naval experts discovered the secrets of German magnetic mines is one of bravery and luck. British authorities suspected the existence of a new type of mine early in the war. However, the secret was only discovered on September 9th, when German planes dropped two of these mines on a beach near Xu Bailinais. They were revealed when the tide receded. The British first photographed the mines and then brave experts set about removing the attached parachutes. The next day, the dangerous task of dismantling the mines began. First, Navy Major Olifritz explained his proposed method to those participating in the operation, so that if any danger arose, the others could begin studying the construction of another mine. After Olifritz finished speaking, he took one of the mines to a wide field and began working alone. He successfully removed the magnetic detonator, thinking it was safe. The others then gathered around and proceeded to dismantle the other parts together. Unexpectedly, another detonator was discovered inside the mine. After careful and skillful work, they managed to remove it safely as well. Dismantling the remaining parts was no problem for the experts. Thus, this new invention that threatened shipping was exposed by British authorities. (Reuters, 2nd)

### French Government Announces Orders - Implementing Purchase Restrictions - Prices to Return to Pre-War Levels - Some Occupations to Be Filled by Women

Paris - The government gazette published 17 miscellaneous decrees today, implementing purchase restrictions and other economic measures. The important ones are listed below: (1) All residents of France must obtain a registered purchase permit from the authorities, starting on April 1st of this year, in order to purchase various restricted goods based on the permit. (2) The baking of all types of fancy breads is prohibited, except for biscuits and similar breads. (3) Candy and pastry shops throughout the country should be closed for three days every week on Wednesday, Friday, and Sunday, but may operate as usual if they coincide with legal holidays. (4) Each restaurant meal must provide only two courses, with meat only accounting for one. Cold dishes and soups may still be provided as usual, but butter may not be provided separately. (5) The amount of gasoline that anyone can purchase each month should be limited to what is sufficient for one car. (6) The drinking and sale of all types of spirits and aperitifs are prohibited on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays. Since July 1st of last year, the retail quantity of these alcoholic beverages must be more than two liters per purchase, in order to restrict the purchase by the lower classes. (7) Farmers throughout the country may purchase seeds for this year at the legally prescribed price. (8) In all areas where residents have been ordered to evacuate, a portion of their land should be cultivated by the army on their behalf. (9) All price increases since September 1st of last year should be restored to their original state. (10) Certain occupations should be filled by women, in order to free up men for national defense work. (11) Audit committees should be established in all agencies to review the expenditures of those agencies. (12) Committees should be established in all departments to assess the prices of goods purchased by those departments. (13) Frugality committees should be established in all military agencies. (14) All foreign expenditures of departments must be determined in advance and submitted to the Cabinet for approval. (Havas, 1st)

Paris - Commerce Minister Shang Dan recently stated that the Cabinet has passed legal decrees hoping to reconcile the two needs of controlling imports and increasing exports as much as possible. From now on, foreign goods that are transshipped through France to other countries or are made into other products in France after being imported and then exported again, only require the importing merchant to submit an application to the authorities stating that the goods will not remain in France and that France will be able to exchange them for foreign currency. The goods will then be allowed to enter without having to go through complicated examination procedures, and there will be no restrictions on their quantity and value. However, the application must be reviewed by a committee composed of representatives from the relevant departments. (Havas, 1st)

### Neutral Vessels - Inspection Issues - Britain and Germany Accuse Each Other

London - The German Embassy in the Netherlands recently issued a document to Dutch newspapers, stating that any neutral country that requests a certificate from British authorities to facilitate maritime inspections is, in effect, acknowledging the blockade measures taken by Britain, and Germany will retaliate. The British Ministry of Economic Warfare issued a bulletin in response, stating that this German document is yet another threat to neutral countries. Well-informed sources also said that the German statement "completely distorts the facts." The purpose of the certificate method is only to facilitate the inspection of goods shipped from countries such as Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay to Europe. Its nature is voluntary and is not due to agreements between Britain, France, and the Americas or neutral European countries. (Havas, 1st)

Berlin - The German official news agency, when announcing the principles of the Hamburg Prize Court's litigation procedure, stated that if a ship sails into an enemy port, the so-called "enemy destination" is proven. This measure also applies to goods intended for neutral ports. (Reuters, 2nd)

### Bank of France - Transfers Large Gold Reserves to the Government - Ministry of Finance Signs Agreement with the Bank

Paris - The agreement signed between the Ministry of Finance and the Bank of France has been published in the government gazette. The main points are: (1) The Bank of France transfers 30 billion francs in gold reserves to the government, and the government will provide Treasury bonds of equal value. (2) After the Bank of France's gold reserves are revalued, the 20 billion francs that the Ministry of Finance borrowed from the Bank of France before the war should be repaid immediately, and the Bank of France will then lend the government an amount still limited to 20 billion francs. Of the above two points, the former is the most important. The government already has a large foreign exchange stabilization fund, and now it will add this 30 billion francs in gold, so its war funds will be extremely abundant. (Havas, 1st)

### Soviet Troops Approaching Suburbs of Vyborg - Finnish Troops Implement Scorched-Earth Tactics - Steady Stream of Fresh Soviet Troops Reinforcing, Attempting Three-Sided Encirclement - Both Sides Engage in Hand-to-Hand Combat, Paying a Heavy Price for Every Inch Gained

Moscow - The Soviet Union issued an official gazette this morning stating that Soviet troops have entered Vyborg, which is engulfed in flames due to the scorched-earth tactics implemented by the Finnish troops before their retreat. (Haitong, 2nd)

Helsinki - Soviet troops are attempting to encircle Vyborg from three points. A large number of fresh troops and mechanized units have joined the battle. On the main front line of the Karelian Isthmus, Soviet troops have advanced, forcing the Finnish troops to retreat. Every inch of land is given up only after hand-to-hand combat until exhaustion. Therefore, the Soviet losses are also very heavy. The Finnish troops are currently making superhuman efforts to hold the line, awaiting the arrival of spring, when weather conditions will make it more difficult for the Soviet troops to advance. It is now acknowledged here that Vyborg may fall, and attention is focused on the isthmus. According to news from other front lines, only artillery activity is reported. (Reuters, 2nd)

Moscow - According to news from here today, the three main roads leading to Vyborg were in the hands of Soviet troops yesterday. It is possible that Vyborg will be encircled from three sides today. The Finns are currently setting fire to Vyborg. Foreign military experts observe that after the fall of Vyborg, the Red Army will likely split into two routes. One route will turn north to outflank the Mannerheim Line, and the other route will continue to advance along the coast, aiming to directly attack Helsinki. (United Press, 2nd)

Helsinki - Officials here acknowledged today that Finnish troops have retreated from their forward positions yesterday due to Soviet pressure. However, they said that this retreat has no significant impact on the Finnish defense, and that the Soviet victory, whether in terms of manpower or material resources, is not worth the cost. Furthermore, according to news from northern Finland, the Finnish troops in the Jemo area have retreated south from Naozi and have now reached a new line of defense that was built earlier. They are currently strengthening their positions. It is reported that Soviet troops have also followed and advanced. (United Press, 2nd)

Moscow - According to a communiqué from the Leningrad Military District Headquarters, the offensive of the United Forces in the Karelian region continued to develop yesterday, occupying the Pskelenksky Falls area of the Visi River, and the Shuli Railway Station (southern suburbs of Vyborg) on the Vyborg-Satu Paul Railway, the town of Yuchyoki, the town of Meinikala, and Cape Kejansnimi on the west coast of Vyborg Bay. The enemy has set fire to Vyborg. From February 11th to March 1st, Soviet troops captured a total of 922 enemy fortresses, including 235 gun emplacements. The enemy also lost 506 cannons, 2,732 machine guns, 19 tanks, 22,000 artillery shells, 10,000 rifles, and 14 million bullets. There were no developments in other areas. The Soviet Air Force bombed enemy troops and military targets yesterday. It also shot down 11 enemy planes in aerial combat. From February 11th to March 1st, the Soviet Air Force shot down a total of 191 enemy planes. The Soviets also lost 21 planes. (TASS, 2nd)

### Germany and Sweden Plan to Mediate - Soviet-Finnish War - Soviet Conditions for Peace as Reported in London

London - The "Daily Express" recently published a dispatch from its correspondent in The Hague stating that after the fall of the port of Vyborg, Stalin is reportedly preparing to negotiate a peace treaty with Finland and has already drafted conditions, which are shown in the attached photographs. The main points are five: (1) The border between Finland and the Soviet Union in the Karelian Isthmus should be re-delimited so that all the main fortresses of the Finnish Mannerheim Line that were occupied by the Red Army last month should belong to the Soviet Union. (2) The coastal batteries of Kovistu and all land batteries between the port of Vyborg and the old border should be handed over to the Soviet Union. (3) The three islands of Hogland, Lavansaari, and Seiskari (all located in the Gulf of Finland) should be ceded to the Soviet Union. (4) The port of Petsamo in northern Finland should be controlled by the Soviet Union for at least ten years. The border between Finland and the Soviet Union in the north should be the city of Neuvottukki. (5) The current Finnish government should be reorganized so that Stalin can show the Soviet people that he is not negotiating a peace treaty with the Finnish plutocratic government. The noteworthy aspect of these points is that the Soviet Union does not intend to demand Hanko Island (located in the Gulf of Finland), the Gibraltar of Finland, nor does it intend to establish a government led by Kuusinen. German and Swedish diplomats are reportedly actively working in Moscow to achieve a successful mediation. (Havas, 2nd)

### Japan's Policy of Controlling Wartime Prices - Complete Failure - Shortage of Goods, Currency Inflation - Difficult Living, People Complain Bitterly

Tokyo - The Japanese government, in order to control the current situation, plans to form a price conference consisting of 15 people, chaired by the Prime Minister and assisted by the four ministers of agriculture, finance, commerce, and health, as well as eight or nine important leaders from the financial and industrial sectors. They will consider the extent to which various goods are affected by increased taxes and higher production costs and will formulate new price standards. (Reuters, 2nd)

Tokyo - The Japanese government, recognizing the importance of the price issue, is now urgently seeking to implement a price countermeasures deliberation council and has decided to discuss and decide on it at an extraordinary cabinet meeting tomorrow. In addition to the Prime Minister, Minister of Finance, Minister of Agriculture, Minister of Commerce, and Minister of Health, the government members of the deliberation council will also include the Minister of Communications. After the cabinet decision, the procedures for consultation with the Privy Council will be carried out next week, and it will be announced and implemented. (Domei News Agency, 2nd)

Tokyo - The "Yomiuri Shimbun" today published an article severely criticizing the Japanese government's wartime price policy, stating that the government's attempts to lower prices are a "descent into failure." The newspaper criticized the government's theory as "fundamentally contrary to economic facts" and stated that the price reduction policy "has now become an obstacle to the daily economic life of the people." The "Yomiuri Shimbun" mentioned that the government recently decided to reorganize the Central Price Policy Committee and merge it into a government advisory body under the supervision of the Minister of Commerce and Industry. The newspaper also criticized the Minister of Commerce and Industry's statement that the government wants to set "reasonable" prices to correct the rise of certain prices. The newspaper warned that there are two reasons for the rising price trend: one is the expansion of the currency system, and the other is the lack of material resources. "If the government attempts to prevent the expansion of the currency system, the huge financial procedures will be hindered. If the government attempts to improve the lack of material resources, the material mobilization procedures must be redrawn. We urgently need great politicians to deal with this situation." (United Press, 2nd)

Tokyo - According to observers here, the cost of living continues to rise as evidenced by the indices. In Tokyo, fuel and lighting costs rose 17 percent in February compared to January, food rose 7.1 percent, clothing rose 1.6 percent, utensils rose 5.1 percent, and general prices rose an average of 6.3 percent. When averaging 137 types of prices, 100 rose, 8 fell, and 29 remained unchanged. According to the "Nichi Nichi Shimbun," Tokyo coal merchants have decided to pre-purchase coal for the next winter and ship it in the summer, but the police department disapproves and is now trying to cancel these orders. Those responsible for fuel supply will soon go to the coal-producing areas to inspect the accounts of the coal mining companies and order them to cancel forward delivery orders. (Reuters, 2nd)

### Anti-War Movement in Japan - High Tide - The More Pressure, the Stronger the Reaction

Hong Kong - According to external news from Tokyo, the anti-war movement in Japan is becoming increasingly turbulent. Alarmed, the Japanese government is attempting to suppress it. For days, it has dispatched a large number of police to conduct investigations in the two locations of Shimoryo and Kyoto Prefecture, arresting 55 intellectuals who are the most active in the anti-war movement. After repeated trials by the Kyoto District Court, all admitted without hesitation and condemned the militarists for misleading the country and harming the people. In order to suppress the anti-war movement in various places and prevent it from becoming more intense, the Japanese government decided on the 29th to sentence Deguchi Onisaburo, aged 70, to life imprisonment, Takagi Tetsuo, aged 67, to 12 years' imprisonment, Deguchi Sumiko, aged 58, to 15 years' imprisonment, Higashio Yoshisaburo, aged 53, to 12 years' imprisonment, Deguchi Baisaburo, chairman of the Omotokyo headquarters, to five years' imprisonment, and Deguchi Isao to 15 years' imprisonment. However, anti-war incidents are still erupting everywhere, and the trend is about to spread like wildfire. (1st dispatch)

### Saito Takao - Disciplinary Issue - Hardliners and Softliners Clash

Tokyo - Regarding the issue of punishing Saito Takao for his inappropriate remarks, he has decided to resign from his position as a member of parliament voluntarily. However, at the time of his resignation, in order to explain his misunderstanding, he wanted to make a clarifying speech at the general assembly. Therefore, he applied to the Disciplinary Committee Chairman Nakai to cancel the decision to postpone the adoption of the punishment committee on the 2nd. The Minseito Party and the Kuhara faction of the Seiyukai Party largely approved of this. However, the Nakajima faction of the Seiyukai Party, the Situation Comrades Association, the Social Democratic Party, and other small factions all advocated expulsion. In the event of voluntary resignation, they would not especially give him an explanation and insisted that he read it out in the parliament. Since the 1st, various factions have made various compromises, but opinions are still divided and have not reached a consensus. The Disciplinary Committee of the 2nd met in the budget committee room in the afternoon, which was unprecedentedly tense. It adjourned at 3:00 PM. The hardliners such as the Kuhara faction of the Seiyukai Party and the Situation Comrades Association advocated careful consideration of Saito's application to Chairman Nakai to postpone the adoption, and did not directly meet with the chairman or convey it in writing, but only communicated it by telephone. The committee was able to approve of this and also advocated that the Minseito Party should clearly state whether it should be responsible for Saito's problem. Therefore, each faction is negotiating on how to deal with this. (Domei News Agency, date illegible)

### British Finance Minister Warns the Nation - Do Not Hold Optimistic Illusions - Germany's Strength Should Not Be Ignored - The Spirit of Resistance Cannot Be Relaxed for a Single Day

London - Chancellor of the Exchequer Sir Simon made a radio address tonight, warning the nation not to mistakenly think that we can now rest easy, that the full force of the war has not yet touched our lives, and that victory can ultimately be obtained cheaply, as this is a dangerous illusion. Simon continued, "We are confronted by a very strong and numerous nation, subjected to the most severe discipline and united by the most rigorous means. Even if the people want to resist, they dare not do so. If anyone asks me to distinguish between the leaders and the people of Germany, I answer that I am willing to do so when the German people show that they are different. I cannot absolve ordinary German citizens of responsibility for Germany's aggression. I now urge you not to heed or believe the various rumors of internal discord or division within Germany. The only wise policy we should adopt is to resolutely prepare to meet the united strength of Hitlerism. As long as this ideology is not eliminated, our efforts should not be relaxed for a single day, and the only possible way to end the war is the elimination of this ideology." Simon then mentioned the quiet period of the first six months of the war, saying that the Allies had been able to use this time. Unlike the enemy, the Allies are not good at being prepared for war. Although Britain and France have made great efforts to carry out the necessary work of rearmament in the past three or four years, there are still many gaps to be filled. Once the war breaks out, any serious shortcomings should be remedied. We have been able to greatly improve our armaments and all our equipment in the past six months. No matter what Germany has improved in these six months, the Allies have gained an advantage in comparison. In these six months, the major overseas dominions have issued credibility certificates, indicating that they are indeed our compatriots. We and the French have also been able to enhance our good understanding, and the legitimacy of Britain and France in all aspects has never been as close as it is today. Today, the two countries have unified command, unified policy, unified finances, and unified supply. This cooperation will continue after the war. The six months of silence has given neutral opinion in the world the opportunity to express its sympathy for the cause of the Allies. If the Soviet Union were not indeed Germany's friend, Germany would have no friends. The barbaric methods used by the Nazis to treat the Polish people, and the tyrannical methods they have taken to sink neutral ships and machine-gun fishing boats and lightships, have undoubtedly shown where the sympathy of recent onlookers lies. Although there are still several neutral countries that fear Germany, I ask, is there any neutral country that hopes Germany will win? (Reuters, 2nd)

### British Blockade: German Coal Exports to Italy Treated as Contraband

The Hague: The British government has decided to consider German coal exports to Italy as contraband. News of this decision has greatly shocked the shipowners of various Italian vessels anchored in Rotterdam, Netherlands. However, they stated that until they receive formal instructions from the Italian government, they will continue loading German coal and await further orders. (Havas, 2nd)

Rome: The Italian newspaper "Giornale d'Italia" commented on the British blockade of German coal exports, stating that the Italian government's timely plans have minimized the impact of the British decision, as one-third of Italy's coal supply comes from overland routes from Germany. (Reuters, 2nd)

Rome: Italian Ambassador to the UK, Bastianini, returned to Italy for consultations several days ago and swiftly returned to London last night. According to observers here, the economic negotiations between Britain and Italy were interrupted due to Italy's continued purchase of German coal. Ambassador Bastianini's return to his post may allow both sides to reopen negotiations as soon as possible. (Havas, 2nd)

### Bishop Walsh's Impressions of Traveling in Chongqing: China Is Indeed Capable of Prolonged Struggle; The Patriotic Sentiment of the People Is Exceptionally Strong; Foreigners Cannot Rule by Force

The "Continental Daily" reports that Bishop Walsh, who has lived in China for 30 years, recently traveled to Chongqing and western China, and is now returning to Shanghai. He is scheduled to depart for the United States on the President Pierce on the 28th. Yesterday (the 27th), according to Bishop Walsh, Chongqing is not only China's wartime capital but also a region of great strength in Asia, a starting point for spiritual, social, and economic rebirth. More than twenty years ago, I (Bishop Walsh referring to himself) first traveled to Sichuan Province, and I have returned to the area at the time when this crucial war in China is about to break out.

Knowledgeable Young Women Serving the Country

After the war began, I stayed in the area for over a year. After being away for many months, I recently had the opportunity to see western China again and have clearly seen the new spirit growing among the people. When I first traveled to Sichuan, I saw soldiers training in nearby small villages; I still see them now, and there are even more of them. Everywhere, there are young people called "Little Teachers" promoting education. The injured are given medical care. Factories, universities, and hospitals are being established one after another. In one of the military camps, I was introduced to a Chinese woman responsible for delousing. She did not mind the dirt and worked, causing her face and clothes to be covered in dust. I spoke with her in my broken Chinese, and soon learned that this woman was one of the best teachers at the Peking Union Medical College. She had abandoned her well-paid job and was working among the soldiers, earning only twenty yuan a month. I constantly encountered similar incidents along the way, which proves that intellectuals in western China are working as "yeast in a dough."

The Will of the People is Exceptionally Strong

The losses and suffering caused by the bombing of Chongqing are truly terrible, but at the same time, it is also an opportunity for improvement. The bombed-out areas are not being hastily rebuilt with houses but are beginning to build good roads to modernize the city. The crowded conditions in the old areas have now been improved, and businesses and residences have been dispersed. Schools and residential areas are being built in the suburbs, and factories and retail stores are located ten to twenty miles outside the old city. Chongqing, like New York, is built on hillsides, and hundreds of tunnels have been dug into the rocks to avoid future bombings. The situation in China's great western capital clearly shows that China can continue its struggle indefinitely. I say this not to judge the rights and wrongs of the war in China. People around the world are fundamentally the same. For example, the Japanese also hope for peace in the Pacific, just as we Americans do. But others should now understand that in this era of human history, foreigners cannot rule the Chinese people by force. When the minds and spirits of the Chinese people are as stimulated as they are today, it is absolutely impossible for foreign military forces to establish a stable Chinese government based on the support of a small number of Chinese. This can be seen from the past twenty-five years of Chinese history, let alone more distant history. The spirit, observation, and creativity that the Chinese people are now displaying are sufficient to prove this point.

There are Currently Seven Million Soldiers

What I have seen is now clearer than before. If China is going to have a war lasting thirty or forty years, then the Chinese people are stepping up preparations to meet it. There are now more than seven million armed people in China, and this number is constantly increasing. However, China's preparation is not focused on weapons and ammunition but on the vast land, the lower economic level of the people, the unwavering determination of the soldiers, the increasing number of leaders with modern education, and the widespread concern of the people in this crucial struggle. I call this the patriotism of the people.

### Chinese Army in Dinghai Achieves Victory

People Offer Flags to Show Respect

Dinghai Communication: The Chinese army in Dinghai launched a counter-offensive on the 11th and achieved victory. The people expressed their joy. On the 19th, representatives of women's groups in the city area crossed the Japanese army's defense line and presented four silk banners and woolen clothes to a certain unit of the Chinese army. A grand presentation ceremony was held in a certain temple at 9:00 AM on the 20th, and the determination of the people's will was reported.

### After the Promulgation of the Implementing Regulations: Inheritance Tax Will Be Collected; The Date and Area of Implementation Will Be Determined by Order; An Evaluation Committee Will Be Established to Evaluate Inheritance

Xin Sheng News Agency reports that inheritance tax is an important component of the direct tax system. The provisional regulations were only officially promulgated by the government on October 6, 1938. The Ministry of Finance drafted implementing regulations based on the provisions of the regulations, which were promulgated by the government on December 30, 1939. The date and area of implementation will be determined by order. All persons who leave property within the territory of the Republic of China at the time of their death must pay inheritance tax. Citizens of the Republic of China who have a domicile within the territory of the country and who have property abroad must also pay tax. The details are recorded as follows:

Establish an Evaluation Committee to Assess Inheritance

An inheritance evaluation committee shall be established at the local inheritance tax collection agency. The committee shall consist of five to seven members. In addition to one representative from the collection agency as an ex officio member, the Ministry of Finance shall appoint members from the following candidates in the local area: (1) One representative designated by the judicial authority; (2) One representative designated by the land administration or civil affairs authority; (3) One representative designated by the education or cultural authority; (4) One representative designated by the local self-government agency or organization; (5) One representative designated by the local financial authority; (6) One impartial local person.

Evaluation personnel shall be responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of the types, amounts, and related documents of the inheritance.

Evaluation of Mining and Fishing Rights Multiplied

The value of mining rights and fishing rights shall be evaluated based on the number of remaining years, multiplied by the following multiples: (1) If the remaining years are one year, the value shall be the amount of its extra profit; (2) If the remaining years are three years or less, the value shall be twice the amount of its extra profit; (3) If the remaining years are five years or less, the value shall be three times the amount of its extra profit; (4) If the remaining years are seven years or less, the value shall be four times the amount of its extra profit; (5) If the remaining years are twelve years or less, the value shall be six times the amount of its extra profit; (6) If the remaining years are sixteen years or less, the value shall be seven times the amount of its extra profit; (7) If the remaining years are more than sixteen years, the value shall be eight times the amount of its extra profit.

Assessment of Ground Rights

If the establishment of ground rights has a term limit and annual rent, the value shall be assessed according to the following standards based on the remaining period: (1) If the remaining period is five years or less, the value shall be the amount of one year's rent; (2) If the remaining period is ten years or less, the value shall be twice the amount of one year's rent; (3) If the remaining period is thirty years or less, the value shall be three times the amount of one year's rent; (4) If the remaining period is fifty years or less, the value shall be five times the amount of one year's rent; (5) If the remaining period is one hundred years or less, the value shall be seven times the amount of one year's rent; (6) If the remaining period exceeds one hundred years, the value shall be ten times the amount of one year's rent. If the establishment of ground rights does not have a fixed term limit, the value shall be seven times the amount of one year's rent. However, if there are local customs, the remaining term limit may be determined according to the customs.

Assessment Standards for Sole Proprietorships

When a business is operated by a sole proprietor, the value of the business rights at the time of the proprietor's death shall be estimated according to the following standards: (1) Scope of business; (2) Amount of assets; (3) Number of years of past operation; (4) Profit and loss situation in recent years; (5) Goodwill. The assessment of immovable properties such as land and buildings shall be based on the market price at the time of the inheritance. If it is not possible to assess it based on the market price, the value shall be calculated by restoring its rent at an annual interest rate of 12%. The value of a pawnshop right shall be its pawnshop right value. The amount of life insurance money agreed to be paid to the designated beneficiary or his heirs at the time of the insured's death shall be exempt from inheritance tax. The calculation of the value of perpetual tenancy rights shall be based on five times the annual rental price.

### History of High-Handedness: Lido Barely Avoids Mishap; Lido Wins Right to Final; Eliminates East Celes 2-1; Penalty Kick in Extra Time

In the semi-final replay of the History of High-Handedness Cup between Lido and Portugal to determine the championship, Lido defeated East Celes 2-1 in extra time, and Portugal eliminated West Phos 2-1. Lido's battle against East Celes in the Yiyuan was a victory against the odds in extremely difficult circumstances. Five thousand fans were overjoyed. The spring was cold and threatening rain. In the first half, East Celes took the lead with 1-0 at 25 minutes. Xu Wen-Kui missed a penalty kick at 12 yards. It was not until half of the second half had passed that Xu Wen-Kui leveled the score. At the end of regulation time, each side had one goal, resulting in a tie. In extra time, Li Yi-Chen scored a penalty kick at 12 yards, and Lido escaped danger by eliminating East Celes, which took a lot of effort.

Lido: Lu Zhong-En, Li Yi-Chen, Zhang Lin-Gen, Yan Shi-Xin, Meng Yi-Liang, Jiang Zhao-Xiang, Cao Qiu-Ting, Sun Jin-Shun, Huang Ke-Hou, Xu Wen-Kui, Zhang Ming-Sheng

East Celes: Ma Li-Si, Hai Lie-Xun, A Nuo-Te, Huo Hou, Jie Lai, Pan Jie-Tuo, Dan Ni-Si, Luo Bo-Zhi, Jin Sai-Lai, Mai Ke-La-De, Pai Er

British Troops Rampage to Take the Lead

Lido kicked off, but unfortunately, the headwind became a tailwind. Wen-Kui received Jin-Shun's pass to Ming-Sheng. Ming-Sheng flicked the ball in, but Hai Lie-Xun blocked it into a corner kick. Ke-Hou headed the ball, but Ma Li-Si parried it into another corner kick. Qiu-Ting took the corner kick, but it was not effective. The British troops attacked with the tailwind, and their momentum was fierce. At this time, the Lido camp was overrun by the enemy cavalry. Fortunately, they were able to defend effectively and suffered no losses. The British troops' arrogance did not diminish slightly. At 21 minutes, Yi-Liang took a goal kick, but it bounced back off Yi-Chen's body. Yi-Chen held the ball and dribbled around, but Pai Er came to snatch it and eventually stole it. Pai Er picked the ball up, and Jin-Zhai-Lai hit it hard, causing Lido to lose a goal. Lido counterattacked, single-handedly entering the goal area, but Wen-Kui was a step late and was saved by Mao Li-Si. Before long, Jin Sai-Lai and Pai Er were injured one after another, and each rested for a moment before returning to the game. The first half ended with the British troops leading by one to zero.

A Hair's Breadth Away From Tying the Score

As the second half began, Lido vowed to take revenge and attacked very eagerly. Three or four opportunities were missed. Ming-Sheng picked the ball up and headed it to Ke-Hou, but he did not get it. Jin-Shun shot in the penalty area and was blocked. Wen-Kui hit the goal, but it bounced back off Hai Lie-Xun's chest. At 20 minutes, Qiu-Ting passed the ball to Jin-Shun, and Hai Lie-Xun accidentally committed a handball. Wen-Kui took the penalty, shooting straight at the goal, but Ma Li-Si parried it. The audience sighed, and Wen-Kui also stomped his feet. Wen-Kui's anger rose from his heart, and he fiercely hooked the shot. The ball shaved over Ma Li-Si's head and flew into the empty goal. Everyone thought it was sure to score, but who knew that Hai Lie-Xun was quick-witted and quick-footed, and rushed back to save it into a corner kick. A ball of hope instantly vanished. At 27 minutes, Wen-Kui lived up to expectations and received a pass from Jin-Shun at the 15-yard mark, sweeping it into the net and redeeming his missed penalty kick. Until the end of regulation time, both sides were tied at one goal each.

Solve the Victory or Defeat in Extra Time

Since a draw was achieved, extra time was played for another 30 minutes. The Lido players were very inspired, and the military prestige was greatly boosted. They besieged the enemy's goal, firing shots like a string of pearls, but they were all saved by Ma Li-Si. Lido fought too bravely, and both Yi-Liang and Lin-Gen were injured. Lin-Gen withdrew to rest due to his poor performance, but since the outcome depended on this move, how could he stand by and watch? Before long, he rejoined the battle. At 12 minutes, Ming-Sheng picked the ball up, and Jin-Shun hit the goal. Jie-Lai, in a moment of desperation, accidentally committed a handball and was penalized again. Yi-Chen stepped forward, and the ball flew out like an arrow, straight into the corner of the net. Lido emerged victorious, and the overall situation was determined. The first 15 minutes ended, and the match continued on the other side of the field. The British troops burned their boats and launched a desperate counterattack, but to no avail. Lido finally eliminated East Celes by a score of 2-1.

### Finance: Speculators Settle US Dollar Positions; Rumors of European Peace Abound, Possibly Lengthening US Dollar Positions in Local Market

In yesterday's foreign exchange market, HSBC's listed prices showed no change. The unofficial British-American exchange market was quiet for half the day. However, some prudent speculators slightly released their US dollar holdings, because rumors of European peace were spreading in the market. If this materializes, the overseas US-British exchange rate may return to the four-dollar mark. In other words, the local US dollar exchange rate will also follow suit and lengthen. Moreover, HSBC continued to supply dollars today, and there were rumors that it was maintaining the rate on behalf of the Currency Stabilization Fund Committee. However, most foreign banks were happy to absorb dollars at a cheaper rate, so the spot US dollar only saw a slight increase of 0.03125. The British pound remained stagnant at the original price of 1/2d, with no change. The morning opening average was still 1/2d and 6.71875 yuan. Initially, although foreign firms were buying, HSBC was reluctant to sell, so there was no impact. Later, a small number of Chinese merchants sold off their positions for this month's settlement, so around 10 a.m., the US dollar slightly lengthened, reaching 6.75 yuan. Afterwards, although money exchange houses and some Chinese banks also followed suit and released their holdings, foreign banks such as Banque Belge and some others were quite willing to absorb them, so the position remained balanced, allowing it to stabilize. The situation remained quiet at noon. By closing, the British pound was still at 1/2d, and the US dollar was at 6.75 yuan. The potential for futures was no different from the spot market.

HSBC Still Supplies

Early in the morning, the London cable showed the near-term down 0.03125, and the far-term down 0.01875. New York silver prices remained stable, and London gold remained unchanged. Exchange rates for British pounds against US dollars, Shanghai yuan, and French francs were all stable. The US dollar against the British pound lengthened by 0.0125, against Shanghai yuan unchanged, and against French francs up 0.025. The Central Bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. The bank's morning opening spot selling price for British pounds was 1/2d, and the US dollar was 6.71875 yuan, with no change compared to the previous close. After opening, although the foreign firm sector came to buy spot sterling, HSBC was still willing to supply it, and at that time, MacKay & Co. also had selling intentions, so there was no impact. HSBC's listed prices were unchanged. The silver balance tax was down by a small margin of 0.015. Afterwards, speculators suddenly began to release their US dollar holdings for this month's settlement, but the amounts were all sporadic, so the loosening trend was minimal. It is estimated that the price sold to Banque Belge and some other banks was 6.6875 yuan. Then, a certain bank resold spot US dollars to foreign firms at 6.75 yuan. At the same time, Banque Sino-Italienne also sold spot US dollars to counterparts at 6.75 yuan. After 10:30 a.m., Chinese merchants made more profits and came to release some more holdings, and Chinese banks and overseas Chinese also settled their US dollar positions for April.

### Certain Atmosphere Intensifies Again; Gold Market Decline Expands

Yesterday's spot gold market situation expanded decline, almost breaking through the 4,800 yuan mark. This was due to HSBC's continuous sales, rumors of the Currency Stabilization Fund Committee's support, today's US dollar's strengthening, and certain negative domestic news, causing market sentiment to become anxious. The end of the week also contributed to the increasing number of retail investors selling, while large buyers from the Hong Kong syndicate were not buying. Although a certain securities firm was buying, its strength was insufficient and did not help. In the first half of the day, the situation was weak from the start. Although the foreign exchange market reported flat, it fell 7 yuan immediately after opening, to 4,842 yuan, which was the highest point of the day. Later, due to the strengthening of the US dollar in the foreign exchange market, sellers became more crowded. A certain gold firm and a certain bank competed to sell, retreating to 4,822 yuan. Later, a certain securities firm suddenly absorbed a large amount on behalf of the local syndicate, and gold firms also started buying, so it temporarily stabilized, recovering to 4,836 yuan. However, at that time, a certain atmosphere suddenly arose in the market, and another securities firm vigorously sold on behalf of a customer syndicate, coupled with cash gold firms and a certain bank selling again, the market situation became difficult again. By the time of the noon close, a low of 4,800 yuan appeared, but the noon close was 4,802 yuan. As a result, it fell sharply by 47 yuan compared to the previous day. In the afternoon, the off-market slightly rebounded. It is said that the final price was around 4,810 yuan. The trading volume for half a day was over 1,000 taels. Jewelry gold was listed down.

Spot Gold Plunged 47 Yuan, Sea Customs Gold Remained Stable

From the morning opening, although the foreign exchange rate was flat, the situation was slightly weak. A certain gold firm was the first to sell, coupled with very few buyers, so the opening price was immediately lowered by 7 yuan, selling 20 taels to a securities firm at 4,812 yuan. Shortly after, a certain bank also came to vigorously sell, and jewelry firms also sold, and the US dollar in the foreign exchange market strengthened, falling 20 yuan. Jewelry firms sold 40 taels to gold firms at 4,822 yuan. Later, due to the sudden rise in buying sentiment from the securities firm, coupled with the fact that a certain gold firm was also buying on behalf of customers at that time, and a certain bank also slightly re-entered, it recovered 14 yuan. Cash gold firms sold 30 taels to securities firms at 4,836 yuan. Then, a certain securities firm suddenly came to sell, and cash gold firms also had strong selling intentions. A certain bank and retail investors sold again. Although money exchange houses and another securities firm still had some buying appetite on dips, it was ultimately difficult to maintain. By the time of the noon close, it had fallen another 36 yuan, with securities firms selling 40 taels to money exchange houses, down to 4,800 yuan. Later, jewelry firms bought 50 taels from money exchange houses, slightly recovering 2 yuan, to 4,802 yuan, as the noon closing price. As a result, it fell sharply by 47 yuan compared to the previous day, with a fluctuation of 42 yuan in half a day. The cash gold firm's listed selling price of its own brand gold was several yuan higher than spot gold, and the buying price was reduced by 20 yuan. The current bid gold was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there was little trading.

Jewelry Gold Listed Down Five Yuan

The selling price of jewelry gold per tael in jewelry stores was initially still 490 yuan in major stores. By 11:30 a.m., it was listed down 5 yuan, and there were no changes after that. As a result, major stores changed their listings to 485 yuan. New stores had the same price as above, and the buying price was reduced by about 15 yuan.

### Australian Dollar Sees Sharp Rise; 8.9 Yuan

Yesterday, foreign currencies, including British pounds and US dollars, saw strong selling pressure, and the market was weak. Large British and US dollar bills were selling, and prices were loosening. In the evening market, British dollar bills fell to 55/2 yuan, and US dollar bills fell to 14.68 yuan. Demand for Hong Kong bills was stagnant, and Singapore and Dutch bills were weak. Philippine bills followed suit and fell. Australian dollar bills were rare, but demand suddenly increased, and prices rose sharply. Japanese dollar bills were slightly firm, and the evening market was 1.0302 yuan.

### Grains: Rice Merchants Cause Trouble; There is No Day Without Problems

Yesterday's rice market in the countryside was only average, and the store purchases continued, and the shouts of visiting merchants suddenly rose. Speculators and retail hoarders came to cause trouble again. By the middle of the market, the prices of various imported rice had all increased by about 0.5 yuan compared to the previous market. No. 1 Saigon opened at 47.5 yuan, Fire Pattern sold at 46 yuan, Small Twist at 43.5 yuan, Tokyo Sharp Special at 43.3 yuan, 42.3 yuan, City at 42.5/6 yuan, 42 yuan, Mixed Broken at 36.8 yuan, Special Green Rice at 41 yuan. As such, the numbers hesitated. Later, the actual sales stopped due to the higher prices, and the market seemed to soften again. Ordinary speculators not only did not sell their holdings, but took this opportunity to buy, and the market had a tight feel. As for glutinous rice, it did not show up with the rise in imported rice, because generally, customers do not have much hope for the market, so they all focused on it, and the sales were very rare, so although the market held to the original price, there was no rise or fall, and the trend was softening. Domestic rice, such as thick japonica rice, thin indica rice, and early and late rice, was expensive, and off-market prices were weak, so there were no changes. Only early and late rice from Nangang traded at 47 yuan, with more than 500 bags of early and late rice from Hongkou.

In other news, although the import rice market showed a softening trend when it opened in the morning, it was soon bought by speculators inside and outside the industry, and the goods party also did not loosen their pricing due to the shrinking exchange rate and rising gold price, and refused to sell lightly with the market. The market gradually raised its price, and as a result, all rice rose by 0.3 to 0.5 yuan. The afternoon situation continued to show a firm trend, with reclaimed small twist from 51.45 yuan to 51.6 yuan, No. 2 Saigon from 52.55 yuan to 52.7 yuan, and No. 2 Siam was called late at 52.5 yuan. Before the close of the afternoon market, the goods party was even more firm and called for a price increase of 0.1 to 0.2 yuan, but there was no further agreement. The spot import rice trading volume was 5,000 bags, with futures at 600 tons.

### Reclaimed Flour Rises 0.5 Yuan; Wheat Market Stalls

Flour: Yesterday's market improved. No. 2 flour mill's trading was flat, with no change. Only reclaimed goods decorated the market, because recently, the Hong Kong syndicate slightly enquired, and sales in the hinterland villages were also active. In general, those who held warehouse receipts all wanted to defend. Old car brand sales opened at 14.8 yuan to 14.9 yuan, a sharp increase of 0.5 yuan compared to the previous day. Green cannon car was also calling for 15.15 yuan, but there was no formal market.

Wheat: Yesterday's trading became more stalled. After the recent decline in wheat prices, the Japanese mills had been trying to buy at a bargain, but the goods party had little inventory and was unwilling to sell lightly. In addition, the price of reclaimed flour was high, and people's hearts were looking forward to good news, so the goods party called for a higher price, while buyers were still thinking of suppressing it. As a result, there was no formal transaction.

### Miscellaneous Grains: Soybean Market Changes

Recently, the soybean market situation has been difficult to revitalize after entering a decline. The enthusiastic attitude of all parties at the beginning of the year was mostly caused by manipulation and monopoly. Since the change in the market in the second half of last month, people's hearts have been downstream, and market prices have declined step by step. Central goods are almost unattended. Yesterday's market continued to fall, but sales were slightly active. A total of 300 bags of Dingjiazhou beans were traded at 26.5 yuan, 3 cars of Bengbu beans at 25 yuan, 1 car of Yuzhou beans at 23.5 yuan, 2 cars of Nanjing beans at 23 yuan to 20 yuan, and 50 bags of Pinghu Du beans at 25 yuan.

### Yarn and Cotton: Short Sellers Take Advantage; Cotton Yarn Falls; Double Horse Falls Below 900 Yuan

The yarn market, which had risen sharply in recent periods, turned to decline today, but the buying and selling in the market was extremely active, so the market changed rapidly. However, the current yarn business is gradually improving, and the Hong Kong syndicate in South China is buying more actively than before, so all parties' minds are still thick. However, there was news of a peaceful truce in Europe, so a part of the short sellers were active, and floating sellers sold off and became loose. However, there are quite a few people who bought up on low prices. The highest price for the March contract was 930 yuan, falling to 904 yuan, and after closing it reached 911 yuan again.

The current yarn market opened in the morning due to the decline in foreign cotton and unfavorable news. There was a lack of buyers in the market. The opening price for the 20-count Fengma January contract was 525 yuan. As soon as this trade opened, sellers appeared one after another, and the market was looser. Shortly after, it fell to 916 yuan. Although it circled midway, people's hearts were still not encouraged. A certain short seller increased its position in a big way, and the market fell straight to 904 yuan. However, as soon as the trade opened, new buying sentiment rose again, and it rebounded again. However, the spot price of Double Horse yarn fell from 915 yuan to 890 yuan. According to the half-day trading statistics, 2,650 bags were traded. The price of 20-count Double Horse yarn fell by 15 yuan. Today, 445 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong, 15 pieces to Guangzhou Bay, 40 pieces to Haikou, and 120 pieces to Haiphong. The amounts bought by each syndicate are listed below:

Hong Kong: 420, Counterparts: 2,205

Mainland: 25, Statistics: 2,650

### Yarn Prices Slightly Weak; Cotton Flower Rise Slightly Weakened

The trading of local cotton was slightly low, but the business of Indian cotton was booming again. Counterparts began to trade in large amounts, so the market was still good. However, both the factory and the Japanese side need cotton, so the market is still firm and expensive, but yarn prices are slightly weak, so it is also affected. The source of cotton from northern Jiangsu included 307 bags of Tongzhou flowers. The current cotton trading situation is listed below.

In other news, the New York cotton market opened this morning because speculators were selling, and later foreign cotton merchants listed for sale, and a part of the bulls settled. The market situation returned to weakness. As a result, the closing price fell more than 10 pounds compared to the previous day. There are rumors of a peaceful atmosphere in the Indian market of the European war, so the market is quite soft, and the forecast is for a sharp drop of 10 rupees. The Egyptian market is closed.

Shanghai's foreign cotton trading yesterday was less lively than a few days ago due to the decline in overseas cotton markets, and people's hearts turned to weakness. The factory side still held a wait-and-see attitude, and if the price was cheap, they would buy a little, but it was only a sporadic transaction. The price of American cotton at Meiteng 6.875 yuan is converted to the factory price as follows:

20 count American Medium Strict Good Ordinary: 266.90

20 count Same Inferior: 25.60

32 count Same: 279.40

42 count Same Inferior: 267.40

32 count Same: 282.40

42 count Same Inferior: 267.40

### Securities: Foreign Stocks Fall More Than Rise; Domestic Debt Rises Strongly

The securities gray market situation was strong and continued to rise yesterday, and buyers were quite active. The peaceful atmosphere also revived. Although it was pure imagination, many people in the market followed suit to fulfill their speculative wishes. The reasons for the rise were mostly due to tighter monetary conditions and the decline in gold and cotton yarn. This kind of rise is difficult to sustain. There were not many transactions in the morning, and the buying and selling parties still adhered to their consistent principles. Xinfu, Lemao, Lianyi and others bought, while the short side Hongkang, Jiufeng, Lianhe added positions. The market price rose slightly. In the afternoon, Xinfu, Shenkang, Lianyi, Tongkang, Datong and others collected. Class C shares rose to 48.65 yuan, but Jiufeng, Lianhe, Runli, Hongda, Xie Da and others sold, and the buying pressure was suppressed, and the trend was slightly weak. Although it was slightly weak after closing, the market was still tight, and there will be a competition next week. As a result, the market price continued to improve by two or three corners, and the turnover was over one million and ten thousand yuan. A more simplified table is shown below:

Stock Trading: Turnover 500 shares of Trust Company stock, at a price of 1 yuan each.

The overall stock market situation was more declines than rises. The public bus company's unresolved strike problem resulted in a sharp fall of more than 1 yuan. Kailping Coal Mine and British United Shipyards also fell. The former fell from 64 yuan to 62 yuan, and the latter fell to 40.025 yuan. Other stocks also fell by 1 yuan to several corners. However, Hutchison Whampoa, Telephone, Gas and other stocks were still quite firm. Rubber stocks mostly loosened due to rumors of European peace in the market, but low-priced stocks such as Chen's were still not lacking buyers, and the result was a slight rise.

London 1st (Friday) Telegram: The listing of Chinese foreign debt in London today was still stable, and there were no changes in the upper and lower debt strips.

London 1st (Friday): Today, the stocks of British Far East companies listed in London were generally stable. Only Curla rubber stock continued to rise by 3 pence, to 2/6 shillings. The rest were the same.

### Textiles: Cotton Cloth Rise Slightly Halted; Sales to Nanyang Most Smooth

Local Cloth: The rise in the cloth market slowed down yesterday. Blue has been rising very rapidly for the past few days, and the money supply is still tight. Speculators sold for profit, but actual sales were still good. Because the factory's current cloth prices are still not enough to cover the cost, the asking price is high, so people's hearts are stable, and the selling market is not moving. The goods are sold in small amounts, and the price is slightly lower by 0.25 yuan per piece. More than 500 pieces were traded in this street. The Zhejiang Wenzhou syndicate had the strongest demand, and continued to handle 300 pieces of coarse and fine cloth, bleached, dyed and printed cloth. Occasionally, the Guangdong syndicate also handled 150 pieces. The Henan and Shandong syndicates handled nearly 100 pieces of blue cloth, poplin, and printed cloth. The Tianjin syndicate handled more than 100 boxes of plain colored poplin, shilin cloth, and blue cloth. The Hong Kong Nanyang syndicate handled 5,500 pieces of bleached, dyed cloth, printed cloth, and twill.

Eastern Cloth: White goods, fine cloth, and fine twill, fell in the morning and recovered at noon. As a result, high-end Longtou fine cloth fell by 0.3 to 0.4 yuan per piece, while medium-end trumpets and colored balls were slightly weaker by 0.1 to 0.2 yuan due to the booming dyeing sales. Fine twill was relatively stable. The northern syndicate purchased 500 to 600 pieces of fine cloth for April delivery, so the Longtou forward price was still good, trading at 29.15 to 29.3 yuan per piece.

Export: 60 pieces of cloth were shipped to Hong Kong today, 87 pieces to Guangzhou Bay, 41 pieces to Haikou, and 170 pieces to Haiphong.

### Sugar Market: Foreign Sugar Unchanged

Yesterday's coarse white sugar was tight at first and then flat. As a result, it was similar to the previous day. The association's trading price was 62.5 yuan for 2/4 coarse white sugar in the local warehouse, and new arrivals in foreign warehouses were up 0.2 to 0.3 yuan, to 62.8 to 62.7 yuan, then to 62.5 yuan. Old goods were 62.2 yuan, transit goods were 49 yuan, Swire's B mark white sugar in the western warehouse was still 66 yuan, the eastern warehouse was 65.45 yuan, and the rest were discounted. The red and Dutch red sugar were unchanged. The local factory's snow white sugar was up 0.5 yuan, to 62.5 yuan. The local No. 1 rock sugar was 74.5 yuan, and Jingming rock sugar was 76 yuan. Local sugar was still firm. Yesterday, the Guangdong syndicate opened for sale 500 bags of Diao Qing sugar, at 47 yuan, up 0.5 yuan. The Chaozhou syndicate opened for sale 85 bags, at 46.8 yuan.

### Northern and Southern Goods: Black Fungus Stable

Although there has not been much black fungus arriving lately, the sales were also low, so the market could not rise excessively. Yesterday, the slightly higher Sichuan fungus opened, at a price of 335 yuan, the ordinary price was 300 yuan, Yichang fungus was 270 yuan, and the shipping package fungus was 300 to 295 yuan.

### Seaweed: Domestic Laver Sold

Due to the small production and rare sources of Ningbo laver, there have been several recent arrivals that have already been sold. The ordinary goods are 370 yuan, and the pulled vegetables are 400 yuan, which is quite profitable.

### Public Buses Resume Service This Morning: Due to Yu Qiaqing's Mediation, Work Resumes First; All Demands to be Further Negotiated Between Both Parties

Following the strike by the workers of the British-owned public bus company, and after mediation by Yu Qiaqing of the Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC), all workers have agreed to resume work first thing this morning. Regarding the thirteen demands made by the workers, direct negotiations will be conducted after work resumes. The company prepared everything last night, and all public bus routes will operate fully from this morning. Details are as follows:

Yu Qiaqing Appointed as Mediator

In order to maintain transportation, the Chinese Public Bus Company is making every effort to restore the operation of all bus routes. Yesterday, the company continued to employ White Russian and Western personnel to drive and sell tickets, operating thirty buses on Routes 1 and 9. The fare was uniformly two jiao, regardless of distance. Furthermore, in order to resolve the strike as soon as possible, the company's manager, Xiao Tuo, visited Yu Qiaqing of the SMC (also a Chinese director of the Public Bus Company) the day before yesterday, hoping that Yu would act as mediator. At the same time, the workers also sent representatives to meet with Yu Qiaqing, requesting him to mediate.

Putting the Overall Situation First, Agreement to Resume Work First

After Yu Qiaqing agreed to mediate, he immediately urged both labor and management to understand each other, restore transportation, and advised the workers to resume work first. Regarding the conditions, Yu Qiaqing guaranteed that the workers would not be disappointed when labor and management negotiate directly in the future. The striking workers were deeply grateful for Yu's mediation. To respect Yu's wishes, they agreed to resume work immediately. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, worker representatives were dispatched to the company on Connaught Road to discuss resuming work with the company's manager, Xiao Tuo, and others.

Preparing Everything to Resume Operations

A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency learned from the company yesterday that the company's Traffic Supervisor, Zhang Delan, had prepared everything last night, such as scheduling vehicles and arranging shifts. Starting this morning, all public bus routes will resume operations. As for fares, etc., everything will be handled as before. The temporary fare arrangements for Routes 1 and 9 during the strike period will be cancelled immediately.

The Union Issues a Notice

The union issued a notice yesterday, which read: "Notice: This matter is a decision made by all union members. Due to economic hardship, we unfortunately engaged in a work slowdown. Now, Mr. Yu Qiaqing has stepped forward to mediate and is responsible for handling the matter properly, and has advised us to resume work first and scheduled negotiations to begin next Monday. The union will certainly accept this. We urge all union members to resume work first thing tomorrow morning (Sunday) and await a resolution. This notice is hereby given. March 2nd, Republic of China, Year 29."

Expressing Gratitude for Assistance from All Sectors

The union issued a notice to thank Mr. Yu Qiaqing and thank all sectors for their assistance: "The union respectfully expresses its deepest gratitude to Mr. Yu Qiaqing for mediating this dispute on our behalf, running around for several days, mediating between labor and management, and providing absolute guarantees on behalf of the company that labor will receive satisfactory terms after resuming work (with letters and seals as proof). For the sake of social security, public transportation, and Mr. Yu's kindness, the union has decided to return to work at the factory this morning (March 3rd). After this unfortunate incident occurred, we received enthusiastic sympathy from all sectors, with expressions of concern and economic assistance. In addition to expressing our gratitude, we hope you will continue to offer your sympathy, assistance, and guidance. This notice."

The Company Accepts the Rice Subsidy Principle

Yesterday morning at 12:00 PM, Chinese Director Yu Qiaqing met with representatives of the striking workers at the Sanbei Company on Guangdong Road. Yu stated that the main purpose of the workers' demands was the issue of rice subsidies due to soaring rice prices. The company has already negotiated the rice subsidy principle and is currently calculating the details. Therefore, he advised the workers to resume work first for the sake of maintaining transportation. The worker representatives were satisfied at the time and agreed to return and advise the workers to resume work, carrying with them a handwritten letter from Yu Qiaqing (original text omitted).

### French Concession Price Evaluation Committee: Three Subgroups Established

In order to suppress prices within the French Concession, the French Concession authorities have organized a Price Evaluation Committee to handle this matter specifically. Its first meeting was held on the afternoon of the 29th of last month. It is now known that the committee has established three subcommittees: one for matters concerning rice and grain, one for matters concerning coal and other fuels, and one for matters concerning the retail of general necessities. Because the above three items are related to the lives of residents, specialized committees have been established to study and discuss solutions.

### Tens of Thousands Purchase Low-Priced Coal Briquettes: Purchasers are All Poor, a Pitiable Situation; Their Difficult Living Conditions are Clearly Evident

The sale of low-priced coal briquettes began at 2:00 PM yesterday. Each coal briquette factory delivered the number of briquettes to be sold at each low-price sales point in the morning. The 14th low-price sales point, Xieyuan Coal Shop at the intersection of Connaught Road and Hart Road, stated that there were no poor people in the area and refused to serve as an agent for the low-price sale. Therefore, the ten dan that it was supposed to sell were merged into the 22nd sales point, Dasenhao at 126 Saposai Road (bringing the total to be sold there to forty dan). Also, the 17th point, Songtaichang, was mistakenly written as Zhentaichang yesterday. Therefore, the actual low-price sale was only held at fifteen locations, with a thousand dan sold each day.

Crowds of Purchasers

This time, the low-price sale of coal briquettes was limited to two jiao per person, so the purchasers were all poor people. The number of people was a thousand times greater than the last low-price sale. Before 1:00 PM, each low-price sales point was already packed with people. The authorities of both concessions deployed three to four patrolmen at each low-price sales point to form a straight line and maintain order. However, due to the jostling of the purchasers, the quantity of coal briquettes at each location was sold out by around 4:00 PM. A total of 25,000 people were able to purchase them, with total cash revenue of 5,000 yuan. However, another 40,000 to 50,000 people were unable to purchase them. Although the method has been improved, the procedures are still very cumbersome because it is necessary to weigh the coal on the spot. It is hoped that there will be further improvements.

Thorough Solution

During the low-price sale of coal briquettes, the Low-Price Sales Committee, the Coal Briquette Industry Association, and each coal briquette factory sent representatives, Chen Cuifang, He Ziguo, Yun Chunsheng, Han Pihao, and others, at 2:30 PM, to inspect each location in cars to prevent the low-price sales points from creating difficulties. Seeing the crowds of poor people purchasing the coal, the representatives realized how difficult their lives were and discussed discontinuing the low-price sales program only after the market price fell below six yuan. Otherwise, it was decided to hold the program long-term in order to reduce the burden on the poor.

Letter from the Coal Briquette Industry

A letter from the Coal Briquette Industry Association states: "In reference to the meeting held by our association on February 22nd, representatives from the seventeen factories earnestly requested that we issue a letter requesting that the Tongcheng, Hancheng, and Damao companies release raw materials. A draft was prepared on the spot, read aloud, and passed. It was certainly not suggested by any one person or intended to shield anyone. We have read the article 'Appeal from Small Coal Briquette Factories' in the local news section of your newspaper on February 1st. The representatives from Huacheng Yuan, Huaxin Ping, and other Huichang factories who attended the meeting stated that they were unaware of the matter. It is clear that there is another purpose. We are truly afraid of confusing the public and therefore request a correction."

Given the extraordinary times, the women's community does not plan to hold extravagant celebrations for Women's Day, but will intensify their efforts in their respective fields to fulfill the responsibilities of women during wartime. At that time, they will also promote the refugee relief movement to benefit the disaster victims. Foreign women will also hold gatherings as usual to celebrate.

### The Japanese Side States that They Will Continue to Control the Northern District; Trolleys and Buses Cannot Resume Operations; Japanese Naval Sentry Posts Will Still be Maintained; This is What They Mean by Returning Police Power in the Northern District

The Yu Lin Newspaper reports that at a reception for reporters held by the Japanese side yesterday (the 1st), when asked about the restoration of trolley and bus services north of the Suzhou Creek, a spokesman claimed that the Japanese Public Bus Company is currently operating in the Northern District and that the company and the personnel of the British Public Bus Company will resolve the matter themselves. When a reporter asked about the issue of rickshaws with Shanghai Municipal Council licenses

Resuming Operations,

the spokesman replied that this matter requires further investigation. Another reporter asked, "The public bus and trolley companies have privileges granted by the SMC; is the SMC not concerned about this matter? The Japanese Public Bus Company has no municipal privileges, so how can the Japanese authorities reconcile the two parties?" A spokesman for the Japanese Navy replied that the Japanese Public Bus Company began operating under

Special Circumstances.

Restoring public bus and trolley services north of the Suzhou Creek would give undesirable elements an opportunity to resume their activities. The Japanese Navy opposes restoring these public services because this move would make it impossible for the Japanese side to maintain effective control. Therefore, this matter must be reconsidered. Asked whether the Japanese Navy intends to continue to

Deploy Sentry Posts

in the Northern District after establishing complete and sound police administration, the spokesman replied in the affirmative. Maintaining sentry posts is a defensive measure. A spokesman for the Japanese Embassy continued, "Returning police power is a step in the process of restoring normalcy, but a complete state of normalcy does not exist. Today, we must consider the actual situation carefully." Several points of

Difference

between the Japanese authorities and the SMC have been resolved peacefully, which is mutually satisfactory. Both sides and the "Shanghai Municipal Government" embrace a spirit of reconciliation. He is truly encouraged that these harmonious policies and resolutions will foster a better atmosphere. The Japanese authorities expect that relations between the Japanese, Chinese, and people of third countries will improve.

Exemption from Taxes Causes Significant Losses

The English-language *Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury* reports that, according to information revealed this morning (the 2nd), the exemption of special taxes in the Northern District of the International Settlement from August 15, 1937, to December 31 of the same year caused the SMC to lose 1,118,011 yuan. 1,017,600 yuan was from general municipal taxes, and 100,400 yuan was from house taxes. In addition, the SMC also lost 255,387 yuan in unpaid taxes from 1937. According to an SMC official, residents of the Northern District

Suffered Losses

during the 1937 war, so the SMC granted the tax exemption. The authorities took similar measures during the 1933 Shanghai war, but the lost tax revenue was not even half of this amount. This morning, the reporter asked Mr. Philip, Director General and Chairman of the Board of the SMC, about the privileged status of the Shanghai Electric Construction Company and the Shanghai General Omnibus Company to resume operations in the Northern District. Mr. Philip replied that he was unable to comment on the matter but would

Consult with the Japanese Authorities

regarding this and other cases in the near future. In addition, according to an official of the trolley company, the Shanghai Electric Construction Company has absolutely no intention of relinquishing its privileges in the Northern District. After Japanese Consul General Miura and SMC Chairman Fessenden signed an agreement yesterday (the 1st), the police department is currently busy making the necessary preparations to fully regain control of the Northern District.

Residents of the Northern District Repeatedly Arrested

The English-language *Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury* reports that, according to news from Chinese residents in the Northern District north of the Suzhou Creek, after the Japanese side abolished the通行證 (Tuōngxíngzhèng) [Pass/Permit] on February 14th and Chinese people flocked to the Northern District, the number of people arrested by the Japanese military authorities is unknown. It is said that several hundred people, mostly adults, have been arrested. Their fate is still unknown. Some have been released after being taken to Japanese military headquarters for questioning, while others, as rumored, have been

Taken to Taiwan

to work for the Japanese. Although the Japanese side denied the above claim in the *New Shenbao* this morning (the 2nd), it is heard from reliable sources that three or four nights ago, Chinese residents went to a theater in Hongkou to watch a play. When they left the theater after the show, the Japanese side checked their通行證 (Tuōngxíngzhèng) [Pass/Permit]. Those who did not have the permit or whose permit had been stolen were forced into

Trucks and Driven Away.

Their destination is believed to be Yangshupu. It is also heard that several dozen Chinese people were arrested in front of the barbed wire fence along North Jiangxi Road, with the most arrests occurring near Haining Road and Peng Road. There have been many instances of Chinese people showing their通行證 (Tuōngxíngzhèng) [Pass/Permit] only to have the sentry tear it up and forcibly shove them into vehicles. The Japanese military has conducted

Midnight Searches

in Dexing Lane at the intersection of Haining Road and Peng Road several times, awakening residents. Some of those who were taken away have not been heard from since. The rumor that Chinese people in Hongkou are being abducted has been circulating for several days, and today we have finally received reliable news.

### Today is Friendship Day

Today is the sixth anniversary of Friendship Day. In these times of national crisis, there will be no extravagant celebrations, but most groups, schools, and organizations will hold simple commemorations. It is commendable that all sectors sympathize with friendship. A certain movie theater is screening "A Tale of Chivalrous Friendship." The YMCA will add a performance of "Long Live Friendship." The Hualian Tongle Association will perform the Peking opera "High Mountains and Flowing Water Seek a Soulmate." Initiator Huang Jingwan will speak about "The Way of Friendship" at the Youth Self-Study Group.

### French Municipal Council Balances Budget: Hopes to Avoid Raising Taxes; Strictly Enforces Economy and Controls All Expenditures; This Year's Budget Should Achieve a Balance Between Income and Expenses

The *Continental Times* reports that Mr. Curtiss, an administrative director of the French Concession Municipal Council, stated to guests yesterday (the 1st) that, based on current observations, the French Municipal Council's financial situation for the end of the 1939 fiscal year did not have an imbalance between income and expenses. Since the budget has not yet been released, he cannot cite exact figures, but according to his observation, the Municipal Council's balanced budget is quite satisfactory. Although he cannot say for sure whether the Municipal Council will raise taxes, if no

Special Events Occur or the Value of the 法幣 (Fǎbì) [National Currency] Drops Sharply, then the French Concession can hopefully avoid raising taxes. The reason the Municipal Council did not have an imbalance between income and expenses last year was because it strictly enforced economy and controlled all expenditures. No funds can be allocated to any part of the Municipal Council without a vote by a special committee. Furthermore, if the Council discovers that certain departments have surplus funds, it does not immediately spend these surplus funds, because the Council knows that the situation may change and the funds may be needed. Therefore, it is

Extremely Cautious about Expenditures, and the Council always allocates funds according to the principle of what is most important and what is absolutely necessary. If it is necessary to economize on maintaining police services or parks, then the funds that are economized will be for the maintenance of parks. The French Municipal Council's ordinary budget revenue for 1940 is 16,799,480.86 yuan, and expenditures are 16,795,524.23 yuan. Therefore, the budget revenue exceeds the budget expenditures, but because prices continue to rise and the exchange rate is uncertain, the above cannot be considered

The Final Figures. The Municipal Council allocates approximately five million yuan to the police department and approximately three hundred thousand yuan to the health department each year. The Council purchased a large quantity of coal last summer, which can supply the city until the end of this year, so fuel costs have not increased significantly. However, the cost of providing heating to schools next year may increase sharply. Regardless of the price of coal, schools must have sufficient heating. As for purchasing a large quantity of coal for the residents of the French Concession, storing it, and adjusting the market price of coal, this is impossible. Because the French Concession has a

Dense Population, the Municipal Council cannot supply the coal needs, and this action would create panic in the market and give the public the impression that there is a shortage of coal, which would only worsen the current situation. Mr. Curtiss concluded by saying that he hopes that the Municipal Council's special committee investigating the market situation will lower prices. The committee will be more successful than any other group in this effort because its purpose is to solve this problem and to diligently study the reasons for the high prices of most necessities.

### The Minhe Steamer, Sailing from Wenzhou to Shanghai, Was Detained Again

Detained for Four Days Before Finally Released; Yongtai Arrives in Shanghai, Daxin Missing

The foreign ships operating on the Shanghai-Tangshan line are frequently disrupted due to Japanese warships blocking the waters outside Wenzhou, resulting in frequent disruptions to their voyages. The foreign ships detained by Japanese warships outside Wenzhou on their way from Wenzhou to Shanghai last week, excluding the Yue Se and Tongcheng, which were released and arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday, include the British ship Yongtai, which sailed back to Shanghai yesterday morning. According to company sources, this ship has no information, (it was sheltering from the wind in the Yueqing waters.) The Daxin ship is still missing. It is expected that it has been monitored by Japanese warships, so it has been unable to send a telegram even though it is en route. According to a reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency, the Minhe ship, owned by the Portuguese company Wanguo Shipping, has been operating on the Shanghai-Wenzhou route. Since the Wenzhou route was interrupted the year before last, the ship has been anchored in Wenzhou for more than a year. Recently, it obtained approval from the Wenzhou-Taizhou Garrison Command and loaded passengers and cargo on the 25th of last month to sail from Wenzhou to Shanghai. However, it was blocked by Japanese warships when it sailed outside Wenzhou and Japanese soldiers were sent on board to inspect it, causing it to be detained outside the port for four days. After repeated negotiations by the shipowner, it was finally released on the afternoon of the 1st. The ship immediately set sail for Shanghai that night. Due to encountering wind en route, it anchored in Ligang and will arrive in port within one or two days. It is reported that it is carrying over six hundred dan of local products from Wenzhou.

### Lawyers Gu Shouxi and Yao Zhaoer Awarded French Government Medals of Honor

According to French newspapers, lawyers Gu Shouxi and Yao Zhaoer of the French Concession Police Department have served for many years and have made outstanding contributions. The French government has specially awarded them the "翰林院 (Hànlín Yuàn)" [Hanlin Academy] Medal of Honor to show its appreciation. The order has already been issued. Also receiving the medal is Mr. Li Kater, Secretary-General of the Legal Department.

### A Large Number of Jews Are About to Go to the Philippines for Farming

The English-language *Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury* reports that, regarding the US government's approval of Jewish refugees settling on Mindanao Island in the Philippines, leaders of the Jewish Refugee Committee in the city recently stated that three to four hundred Jewish refugees currently living in Shanghai who are familiar with agricultural work will leave Shanghai to settle on Mindanao Island. However, the date of their departure has not been decided. It may be within a month, or even within a year.

### The Jinxing Steamer Capsizes at the Zhenhai Port; All Passengers on Board Perish; The Ship Was Carrying Passengers to the Moufu Steamer Yesterday Morning; Disaster Caused by Small Ship, Too Many People, and Careless Navigation; No Detailed Reports on Rescue Efforts Afterwards

Since the Shanghai-Ningbo shipping line was blocked by the Zhenhai Port blockade line, foreign ships have been anchoring at designated anchorages outside the port fortress. Passengers and cargo were loaded and unloaded using barges and tugboats, which caused many inconveniences and delayed ship schedules. Recently, in order to unload cargo and allow passengers to embark and disembark, the Ningbo side organized a Barge Transportation Management Office to handle cargo import and export and passenger transportation. Therefore, there are eighty to ninety barges of various sizes for transporting cargo, and several small steamers such as the Tianma, Tianbao, and Jinxing for transporting passengers. Recently, it has been going smoothly. Since the fall of Xiaoshan, people have been uneasy. Shipments from the city have decreased, while shipments arriving have surged. In order to facilitate passenger travel, the authorities have specially allowed smaller ships to enter the port. Therefore, the Gaodeng ship can now sail directly to the north bank of the Yangtze River. The Hana and Haikang ships are also considering traveling to Ningbo, but there is no news of their entry. Yesterday, the shipping industry in the city received a telegram from the Zhenhai branch company stating that this morning (yesterday), the Jinxing ship, carrying over three hundred passengers to the Moufu steamer, capsized due to its small size, too many people, and careless navigation, resulting in a tragic accident. All three hundred passengers perished. No detailed reports have been received regarding rescue efforts.

### Fierce Battle at Erzao Hong; Japanese and Puppet Troops Suffer Defeat

On February 25th, the Japanese and puppet troops in Pudong advanced in three directions towards Erzao Hong, the location of the Second District, led by District Chief Lian Baisheng. The first route consisted of seven or eight Japanese soldiers and over forty puppet soldiers, carrying two grenade launchers and five or six light machine guns. When they arrived about half a li southwest of Erzao Hong at around 7:00 AM, the First Company of the Second District Brigade unexpectedly attacked them with machine guns, killing several of the leading puppet soldiers immediately. A fierce battle then erupted, lasting until around 11:00 AM. A Japanese sergeant in command was killed, and many Japanese and puppet soldiers were killed or wounded. Three puppet soldiers then disguised themselves and swam to the Japanese in Nanhui County for help. The Japanese then sent reinforcements in two routes. One route, carrying a small cannon, a grenade launcher, and seven or eight light and heavy machine guns, arrived near Yaojiazhai. The other route, carrying two grenade launchers and four or five light and heavy machine guns, arrived at Situan Hong. Upon hearing the news, the Chinese side also sent reinforcements in two routes. At that time, the sound of cannons roared in all directions and machine guns fired intensively, and the battle was fierce. After fighting for over three hours, the Japanese and puppet troops in Situan Hong first retreated towards Situan Cang Zhuqiao Town. The southern route also retreated towards Nanhui County at around 4:00 PM, looting chickens, pigs, eggs, cloth, clothing, soybeans, rice, and other items from farmers' homes along the way, loading them onto five boats. In this battle, the First Company lost one soldier and one was seriously injured. On the Japanese and puppet side, according to reliable sources from the puppet troops, six Japanese soldiers were killed, two were seriously injured, thirteen puppet soldiers were killed, and over ten were seriously injured.

### Invention of Cosmic Rays: Coincides with Chinese Theories
### Astronomical Changes Indicate Major Upheaval on Earth
### Scientific Validation of Ancient Chinese Philosophies
### Professor Millikan and Wife Depart for America by Ship Yesterday

Professor Millikan, the inventor of cosmic rays, along with his wife and Professors Picard and Neher, concluded their cosmic ray measurement expedition from India.  During a stopover in Shanghai, they gave a brief lecture and departed Shanghai yesterday (29th) at 11:00 AM aboard the President Pierce. Before leaving, Professor Fan Fengyuan, representing the Chinese Institute of Engineers and Shanghai Great China University, boarded the ship to greet them and express welcome.

China's Future is Promising

Originally, Professor Millikan planned to lecture at Shanghai Jiaotong University. However, due to the ship's short, 24-hour stay in Shanghai, this plan was unfortunately not realized. He expressed optimism about China's future and sympathy for China in the Sino-Japanese war. He also lamented the plight of Jewish refugees in Shanghai.

Initial Discovery in India

Professor Millikan stated that the first measurements of cosmic rays were made in India in 1910. Subsequently, further experiments were conducted in North and South America, even in the ocean depths and the stratosphere. He found that cosmic rays are very rare.

Weak Magnetism Allows Easy Penetration

He later learned that the Earth's magnetism acts as a barrier to prevent cosmic rays from reaching the surface. Therefore, very few cosmic rays are measured near the Earth's north and south poles. At the equator, the center of the Earth's surface, the distance to the north and south poles is equal, resulting in the weakest magnetic field, allowing cosmic rays to easily penetrate. This is why he decided to go to India for measurements, which lasted three months and yielded very satisfactory results.

Method of Measuring Strength Differences

Professor Millikan also showed Professor Fan the instruments used to measure cosmic rays, including simplified versions. He explained how they are attached to balloons, how they ascend into the clouds, and how records are taken. Wireless instruments and precise automatic recorders are used, utilizing the ionization effect of cosmic rays on gases. The strength of the current indicated by the vacuum tube reveals the strength of the cosmic rays.

Chinese Theories Possess Profound Truths

Professor Millikan stated that cosmic rays have a very close relationship with human psychology and thought. Human evolution is entirely driven by cosmic rays. Ancient Chinese sages often said that astronomical changes portend major upheavals on Earth. This statement has considerable significance. Changes in sunspots, shifts in the Earth's magnetic field, all cause changes in the way cosmic rays penetrate to the surface.

Terrestrial Changes Caused by Evolution

Changes in human psychology, changes in thought, and changes in individual thought can all trigger wars. Truly, all human actions on Earth are shaped by evolution. The future changes in human life will be even more profoundly affected by the discovery of cosmic rays. The Bible and Buddhist scriptures both begin with the concept of light. The profound truths within them are only beginning to be understood with the discovery of cosmic rays.

Far-Reaching Impact of Future Changes

The world was once dark, and humans were like apes. Light, especially cosmic rays, arrived, and humanity began to evolve from apes into humans. Future changes in the world's written thought are deeply connected to today's research on cosmic rays. Finally, Professor Millikan presented several photographs and stated that his research findings would be published in New York in the shortest possible time, as all expenses are being funded by the Carnegie Institution of New York.

### Post Office Parcel Section to Relocate: Under Consideration

### Possible Transfer to Other Branches: Implementation Pending Confirmation

Since the Japanese side extended the barbed wire along Suzhou Road on North Jiangxi Road, access to the Shanghai Postal Administration Building has become extremely inconvenient for the public and postal workers alike. Although the postal authorities have sent representatives to negotiate, the Japanese side has yet to respond, affecting the postal service. According to a report from the Datong News Agency, parcel post used to be handled solely at the Administration Building. However, as the public is largely unwilling to travel through the restricted zone to mail parcels, the authorities are now considering relocating the parcel section to other branch offices. Once confirmed, the plan will be implemented to facilitate the public.

### Hydraulic Engineering Society Seeks Records of North China Floods

The Hydraulic Engineering Society of China believes that the floods in Hebei Province and Tianjin last year were more severe than those in 1917. The Society plans to collect the following information: (1) Causes of the floods; (2) Maximum inundated area and size; (3) Riverbank breaches, including date, location, width, depth, and number of diversions; (4) Damage to dikes; (5) Discharge situation, such as the path of the water and the time of drying up; (6) Changes in rivers and lakes; (7) Estimated losses; (8) Suggestions for post-disaster relief; (9) Other relevant information. Any survey reports or personal records pertaining to the above are welcome. Please send them to the Chinese Institute of Engineers, P.O. Box 184, Hong Kong Post Office. If you wish to be compensated, please indicate this, and a reasonable amount will be paid.

### Buddhist Fellowship Distributes 300,000 Congee Tickets

The Buddhist Fellowship is providing congee at eighteen congee shops in the two concessions, serving over six thousand people daily. Chairman Fan Cheng, a monk, stated that the congee distribution period has been extended to the beginning of summer. The number of congee tickets has increased to three hundred thousand. However, due to rising rice prices, each bowl, weighing fifteen taels, costs six fen at current prices. Congee tickets are sold in units of three yuan, which buys fifty tickets. He hopes that people from all walks of life will contribute generously. The Fellowship's address is inside the Dharma Treasure Hall at 418 Hart Road. Donation collection points: (1) National China Bank, Eight Immortals Bridge; (2) Southeast Trust Company, 134 Avenue Edward VII; (3) China Fiduciary Savings Bank, Jing'an Temple Road and Route Muri.

### Publication News

The Sino-American Weekly, published by the American Roosevelt Publishing Company, features refined content and maintains a correct stance. Since its publication, it has been well-received by readers. The twenty-third issue has now been published, retailing for one dime in national currency.

### Multiple Criminal Cases Found Involving Weapons Seized from British Soldiers
### In Addition to Firearms Confiscated by British Troops, the Police Department Has Also Seized Numerous Weapons
### At Least Eleven Criminal Cases in the Past Two Years

The "China Press" reports that British soldiers from the East Surrey Regiment seized firearms from "rogues" and thugs on Tuesday near the former Hua Bao Dang. It has now been confirmed that some of these weapons, after being investigated by the Public Security Bureau of the Public Concession, were used in major political shooting cases in Shanghai in the past. The groups to which these weapons belonged have repeatedly committed politically motivated acts of violence and resisted police and patrols in various parts of the city, especially in the lawless Western District. The details are as follows:

Details of the Firearms Seized by British Troops

On Tuesday, a British military patrol, consisting of one corporal and five soldiers, apprehended thirteen suspects near a lane off Omei Road, seizing one rifle, eight various pistols, and one fake pistol. The pistols included four Mauser pistols, and one each of the Marlowe, Astra, Typhoon, and Francis types. They were handed over to the Firearms Section for examination, leading to a startling discovery.

Attack on Newspaper Office Last July

Firearms experts confirmed that the Mauser pistol and Astra pistol were used by thugs on July 2nd of last year to attack a Sino-American joint venture newspaper office at 160 Avenue Edward VII. The thugs threw hand grenades and opened fire, killing an American named Mr. Wilson who bravely assisted the police, and an rickshaw puller who happened to be passing by. Twelve others were injured, including two policemen.

Eleven Cases Committed

Furthermore, after examining the weapons, it was discovered that a certain group to which these firearms belonged had carried out twenty terrible operations in the city between 1938 and 1939. According to sources yesterday, in addition to the weapons seized by British troops on Monday, the police had seized many other firearms. It has been discovered that thugs have used these firearms to commit assassinations, attempted assassinations, attacks on Public Concession police, and other crimes to intimidate the public, totaling eleven cases.

(1) On November 9th of the previous year, a large-scale attack was launched on a gambling den at 65 Gordon Road, known as the "Asia Club." The "Club" was hosting a banquet to celebrate the engagement of a certain foreigner and a Chinese woman. Suddenly, thugs threw hand grenades and opened fire. The weapons used by the thugs belonged to this criminal group.

(2) One of the pistols was used in an attempted robbery of a Chinese dry cleaning shop at 506 Great World Road in June of last year. The shop owner's son called the police, and the robbers opened fire and fled.

(3) On the morning of June 15th of last year, a detective from the police department was patrolling Jessfield Road when he was shot at by armed thugs. Fortunately, the detective was not hit and gave chase, but the thugs escaped.

(4) On the evening of June 17th of last year, thugs used a pistol to threaten employees of the China University Bookstore at 20 Ningbo Road, firing several shots. A hand grenade was placed outside the door, but it did not explode and was safely removed.

(5) On the night of June 20th, several thugs attempted to rob the residents of 436 and 438 Robertson Road. The residents called the police, and the thugs fired four shots and fled without carrying out the robbery.

(6) In late July, the police department's search team engaged in a shootout with armed thugs on Wuzhen Road near Xinza Road. The thugs killed two and wounded one.

(7) On August 18th, thugs robbed a cotton mill at 255 Singapore Road. After the robbery, the thugs fired shots to intimidate the workers. Two days prior, these thugs had gone to the cotton mill and extorted five hundred yuan, claiming they would "visit again."

(8) In August of last year, a man named Zhang Yucun (transliteration) was shot and killed by thugs while walking in front of the South Caojiazhai in the Western District. The pistol used in the murder has been seized.

(9) These firearms were used by thugs on October 20th to attack Public Concession police officers directing traffic outside the concession on Yuyuan Road at the intersection of Edinburgh Road. The thugs killed Chinese Constable No. 3378 who was directing traffic and attempted to assassinate an Indian Constable who was also directing traffic at the intersection, but failed. The motive for this case, other than to intimidate Public Concession police officers working in the area, is unclear.

(10) A Public Concession Indian Constable was shot at by thugs outside 1464 Jessfield Road, but was not injured.

(11) On the morning of October 19th, there was a prolonged shootout in the suburbs near the intersection of Edinburgh Road and Brenan Road. The reason for the shootout remains a mystery. The police department has been unable to determine the cause of the fighting, nor whether there were any casualties.

### Robbery on Maybach Road: Robbers Wound Victim, Flee
### Two Robbers Resist Arrest, Flee Scene

At approximately 7:15 PM last night, two robbers arrived at 393 Maybach Road, Public Concession. One of them pulled out a firearm and ordered everyone to be silent. They stole a significant amount of jewelry and cash. As they left with the loot, one of the victims followed them, shouting "Robbers!" A Chinese Constable, No. 569, from the Chengdu Road Police Station, happened to be passing by and gave chase. Realizing they were in trouble, one of the robbers with a gun turned around and fired two shots at the constable. One bullet hit the constable's left leg, causing him to bleed profusely and collapse. By the time nearby patrol officers arrived, the two robbers had fled into the crowd. The wounded Constable No. 569 was taken to the police hospital for treatment by ambulance.

### Cruel Thug Kills Rickshaw Puller: Laborer Also Stabbed

Rickshaw puller Feng Qingshan, approximately twenty years old, drove his rickshaw, No. 22101, to a repair shop on the bridge at Wuzhen Road and Xinza Road at approximately 6:00 PM yesterday. While the rickshaw was parked on the side of the road, a gangster demanded money from him. An argument ensued, and they began to fight. The gangster pulled out a knife and stabbed the rickshaw puller in the chest, piercing his back. Bleeding profusely, he collapsed. At that moment, the rickshaw puller's assistant, Li Deyu (34 years old, from Jiangbei), bravely stepped forward to apprehend the assailant. Unexpectedly, he was stabbed twice in the shoulder and once in the arm by the gangster. Covered in blood, the assailant eventually escaped. Nearby patrol officers arrived after hearing the commotion, but the assailant had vanished. Ambulance No. 83 was summoned to the scene and took the two injured men to Baolong Hospital. However, Feng Qingshan died en route due to his severe injuries. It was later learned that rickshaw No. 23101 belonged to the Deli Rickshaw Company and was rented to a Mr. Wang for business. The police are currently searching for the assailant.

### Pimping Thugs Lure Customers: Seize Opportunity to Rob
### Two Criminals Arrested, Awaiting Investigation

Recently, thugs in the Hongkou area have been using the guise of pimping to lure customers to brothels, taking advantage of intoxicated foreigners to steal their belongings. At 10:15 PM the day before yesterday, a Russian man named Shlankoenko was walking near the intersection of Avenue Edouard and Macleod Road. Due to excessive drinking, he intended to visit a brothel. While he was wandering around, a man from Jiangbei named Huang Xianchen (15 years old) approached him and said in English that he knew a good girl who could accompany him to a brothel. Mr. Shlankoenko was led into a dark alley, where he was surrounded by Hu Zhaolin, a Jiangbei man who ran a private brothel at 97 Macleod Road, and another man named Wang who is still at large. They pulled out knives and fake pistols, ordering him to be silent. They robbed him of a wallet containing American dollars, Japanese yen, and national currency worth 748 yuan and fled. After the incident, Chinese and foreign detectives from the Hongkou Police Station apprehended Hu Zhaolin and Huang Xianchen. The stolen goods were not recovered. The knives were seized, and the criminals were taken into custody. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police Attorney Qian Qiongjiu charged them with robbery and requested a postponement. Later, the Russian man, Shlankoenko, testified to the events, identifying the defendant Huang Xianchen as the person who lured him to the brothel. When questioned, the two defendants gave evasive answers. Judge Huang Risheng ordered them to remain in custody and adjourned the hearing.

### Pushan Village Appeals to All Sectors for Donations

### Soaring Wood Prices, Gasoline, and Labor Costs: Burial Services Urgently Need Funds

Pushan Village has been providing burial services for years, initially without reliable funding. It has been maintained only through the continuous donations of philanthropists from all walks of life. In 1939, the village buried over 41,000 bodies, large and small, and provided 12,878 coffins, large and small. With the rising prices of all goods, the cost of wood alone has more than tripled. Other expenses, such as gasoline and labor, have also continued to increase. The village is appealing to philanthropists from all sectors to make generous donations and extend their benevolence to the deceased. Donations can be sent directly to the General Office of the Village at 210 Six Malu.

### Fake Police About to Rob

The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury" reports that a taxi stand on a side street off the Great West Road in the Shanghai West area was robbed of 300 yuan by two armed men four days ago. The employees of the taxi stand decided to report the incident to the nearest police station the next day. However, they recognized two of the "police officers" as the same thugs who had committed the robbery the night before. As a result, they did not say a word after entering the station and quickly left.

### Gambling Dens in Nanshi Closed Yesterday

### It is Difficult to Know if They Have Been Banned

The French authorities recently sent a letter to Du Yuesheng, requesting that he order the so-called "Nanshi District Government" to ban existing and planned gambling dens in Nanshi to maintain public order. It is reported that Du Yuesheng has not yet given a formal reply. However, yesterday morning, all the gambling dens that had opened in Nanshi, such as Shengsheng Company and several others, suddenly sent people to tear down all the red paper signs posted at the entrances and closed the doors tightly. As a result, when people went to investigate yesterday afternoon, all the gambling dens were deserted. However, it is not yet known whether they have been formally banned.

(Additional News) Since the iron gates at the New Bridge and other areas in the French Concession near Shanghai City's Ji畝地 and Ximen were opened, a group of gangsters have rented large buildings and opened gambling dens. Five or six have already opened. However, for unknown reasons, three or four of the gambling dens that had opened have closed in recent days. The gambling table inside the former Daquanfu Hui Cuisine Restaurant next to the Guandi Temple in Ximen also closed yesterday morning.

### Tram Company Robbed Yesterday: Possibly Related to Carjacking

At approximately 0:30 AM yesterday, during the curfew, a car belonging to the Xiang Sheng Taxi Company, registered as No. 18516, was driving on Jiaozhou Road in the Shanghai West area. Suddenly, several thugs with guns blocked its path and threatened the driver. Under duress, the driver could not move. The thugs dragged him out of the car, held him at gunpoint, and another thug drove the car away. After more than twenty minutes, the car suddenly returned to the original location and was returned to the driver. At that moment, a gang of thugs armed with firearms arrived in a car at the tram company's ticket booth at the intersection of Hart Road and Fuxu Road. They swarmed inside, threatening the employees and searching the premises. A total of 3,500 yuan in national currency was stolen. They then rushed out, got back into the car, and fled. After the incident, the company reported it to the Jing'an Temple Police Station, which sent detectives to investigate. The police are still investigating whether the carjacking of the Xiang Sheng Taxi Company is related to this case.

### Robbers Commit Robbery: Victim Seizes Gun

### With Weapon Gone, They Could Not Act: Robbers Fled, Losing Everything

### A Strange and Fortuitous Encounter

In Yue County, there was a man named He from Sijia Mountain, whose family was impoverished and made a living by working as a hired laborer. Every year during the harvest season, people from Yue County often went to the Qiantang sandbars to work as short-term laborers for farming families. He also went with three companions to sit in a teahouse to wait for employers. He jokingly said to his companions, "This year, whoever hires us must have a daughter, only then will I agree to work, as I have a small matter to attend to." His companions all secretly laughed at him. It happened that a Mr. Jiang, who needed to hire short-term laborers, was in the teahouse looking for people. Hearing He's words, he felt quite resentful, so he hired his companions but refused to hire He. His companions said to He, "Tonight you have no place to stay, after dinner you can come to Jiang's house to ask for lodging." He nodded in agreement. After dinner, the companions told Jiang about the request for lodging, but Jiang firmly refused, and immediately ordered the door to be closed, leaving the companions helpless. Although Jiang was a farmer, he was wealthy. He had a daughter who was of marriageable age, and she had a secret affair with her cousin, and they were planning to elope that very night. Outside the back window of the bedroom was the main road. As the night deepened and people became quiet, the daughter leaned alone against the window and waited, but her cousin was unable to come due to important matters. He arrived at Jiang's house to seek lodging, but found the door already closed. He wandered outside the garden wall. The daughter heard footsteps below and thought her cousin had arrived, so she threw down two large cloth bundles from the window, and secretly opened the back door to leave. He was at a loss, when suddenly he saw the large bundles thrown down. He picked them up and found them quite heavy, and was delighted, thinking it was a gift from heaven. He carried them and walked away, and the daughter followed behind him. To avoid being discovered, they did not speak to each other. After walking two or three miles, they reached a cool pavilion. He was quite exhausted, so he entered the pavilion to rest. The daughter arrived in front of him, and they looked at each other in great surprise! She wanted to return but could not, so she explained the whole situation to He, and expressed her willingness to marry him. He was not yet married, so he rented a house in Linpu and lived there with her. He used the seven or eight hundred yuan he had obtained as capital for a small business, and they lived harmoniously and comfortably, gradually becoming well-off. Just this spring, Jiang found out and came to recognize his daughter. He acted as if he were a father-in-law and son-in-law who were afraid of each other, and he sent another three hundred thousand in dowry money. This was truly a strange and fortuitous encounter.

Children's Weekly

### On Making Friends

— Yiyi Guan Zhu

Everyone, regardless of gender or age, cannot avoid making friends while living in this world. Boys have male friends, girls have female friends, adults have adult friends, and even children have young friends.

However, if one is not careful in making friends, it is extremely dangerous. Because friends are like a blacksmith's furnace. If you befriend good people, it is like throwing iron into that furnace, which can be forged into useful steel. In other words, befriending good people can increase your knowledge, correct your mistakes, and make you a useful person. If you befriend bad people, then you are like a piece of iron thrown into a bad furnace, which will not only fail to forge useful steel, but will also ruin you! In other words, making bad friends will not only lead you down a path of depravity and destruction, but will also cause your original pure and kind character and behavior to be assimilated and transformed. As the saying goes, "Those who are near vermilion get stained red, and those who are near ink get stained black." From this perspective, isn't it dangerous and frightening to be careless in making friends? Therefore, the ancients said, "A gentleman is cautious in making friends."

In short, once a person lives in this world, whether male or female, young or old, they cannot live in isolation and must need to make friends. Boys have male friends, girls have female friends, adults have adult friends, and even children have young friends, as mentioned above. Therefore, I hope all of you dear children, you must be careful when making young friends now, and you must be even more careful when making adult friends when you grow up!

### Koxinga Bottle

— Gang

Young friends must be unfamiliar with the name "Koxinga Bottle." Here, I can tell you the origin of the Koxinga Bottle, because it is also worth knowing.

During the late Ming Dynasty, Koxinga resisted the Qing Dynasty. Seeing the importance of Quanzhou, he set up artillery platforms along the coast. He usually stored the gunpowder he used in long magnetic bottles. When the gunpowder was used up, he would throw the bottles into the sea. Because the Tang King bestowed the surname Zhu on Koxinga, people generally called him Lord Koxinga, and this type of bottle was named the Koxinga Bottle.

Koxinga Bottles are now regarded as珍品珍品, because they are in the sea, they are either caught by fishermen or washed up by the tide. The most valuable ones are those with shells attached to the outside of the bottle. The more shells, the longer the age. Now it is not easy to buy them in the Quanzhou area, and even if there are, they cost dozens of gold coins each. Especially because they are used to commemorate heroic figures who served the people, people are scrambling to buy them.

Although Koxinga Bottles seem unfamiliar to us, they are worthy of our commemoration and should be known.

### Bombing

— Xianming

Since the outbreak of the war, newspapers often contain news such as "Airplanes fiercely bombed cargo trucks, but according to the information obtained, the losses were minimal..." or "On a certain day, several airplanes bombed a certain airport, destroying several planes..." Yong'er doesn't bother to read such unfavorable news because it doesn't pique his interest. But if he sees our planes bombing enemy positions, he must read it and study it carefully, not wanting to miss anything, while also showing a joyful expression. Moreover, he also has a strong ambition, which is to become a pilot in the future and drop bombs to bomb other people's important locations, the "boom" sound is so exhilarating! This is his daydream, his brother - Zong'er often says about him. However, he is not very clear about the matter of airplane bombing, which is what he urgently needs to know.

"Brother, what exactly is bombing? Is it very interesting?" He asked in this way.

"I once read a book about airplanes, and it told us: Airplane bombing is not an easy task. We especially want to fly the plane to our destination, and then quickly dive down. When the distance between our plane and the destination becomes close, we aim the bomb at the destination and drop it, then we hear a "boom" sound, accurately destroying the destination. But the result is greatly contrary to your ideal. In reality, the bomb will never casually listen to you and fall to the destination you want to bomb. If you carefully examine the situation of dropping bombs from an airplane, you will find a very strange phenomenon. You know, the dropped bomb and the airplane seem to be connected by invisible lines, as if there is a suction force that keeps it under the airplane. By the time the bomb reaches the ground, it is very far away from the destination you want to bomb. Not only does it not achieve the effect of bombing, but it also wastes the value of a bomb. What is the reason for this? This phenomenon proves Newton's first principle - the law of inertia: Because when the bomb is on the airplane, it is being carried along with the airplane. When you drop it, it leaves the airplane and falls down. However, it will not lose its original speed in the air. At the same time as it falls, it must continue to complete the movement it just made in the air, resulting in two movements: vertical (falling) and horizontal (the airplane moving forward). As a result, the bomb has to fall in a curved arc, which is far away from the destination you aimed at. Therefore, to make bombing accurate, you must calculate the airplane's speed, the bomb's descent conditions, and the wind speed in advance. Being a pilot is not easy. I don't approve of you being a pilot who invades others. I only hope that you will be a pilot who serves the people properly in the future, that is glorious!"

### Friendly Animals

— Qing

There are many very strange friendly relationships between animals. For example, when a cat sees a bird, it inevitably has a big appetite and drools, which children know.

However, in Brownswood, Australia, there is a man named Weiss who keeps a cat and also raises a partridge. The cat and the bird live together daily and have become very good friends. They are very affectionate with each other. Not only does the cat not have the slightest intention of harming the partridge, but it also protects it everywhere. The little partridge often sleeps sweetly in the cat's arms, and the cat also uses its claws to hug the partridge tightly. This sincere spirit of mutual affection and love cannot be compared to those who are fierce inside and pretend to be friendly on the face. Although they are called humans, they are truly inferior to these animals!

### New Fable

— Gongchao

The snail crawled slowly on the ground, slower than the slowest tortoise. A long trail of mucus remained behind its body, reflecting the sunlight and emitting colorful radiance. The snail often looked back triumphantly, thinking, "This is the rainbow on the ground. No other animal in the world can create it!"

As it crawled, it suddenly saw something pale white and segmented, like a tall city wall, blocking its path and preventing it from moving forward. It looked closely and realized it was a snake skin. It said disdainfully,

"A snake skin, a dead thing! Once, I competed with a live snake in length, and I only stretched out half of my body, but it was still shorter than one of my antennae. We also competed in speed. I had already reached the destination, but it was still lagging behind in my rainbow, admiring its beauty. Even a live snake lost to me. Hmph, you dead thing, how dare you block my path!"

Before it finished speaking, the small green snake that had shed the skin, not having gone far, replied, "Mr. Snail, you have such a long body and such fast feet, I would like to learn from you. Come, let's compete! If you lose a little, I'll eat you!"

The snail was so frightened that it retracted its entire body into its shell and did not dare to stick its head out for a long time.

### Youth and Old Age

— Zhao Yilin

Mulaolin's Fable

A greedy young man said to his father, "My dear father! Please treat me better and tell me how to seek happiness." The old man said, "This is a glorious pursuit; to obtain happiness, one must work as usual, using their talents to serve their country day and night." "Alas! Living like this is too tiring! I want to do a job that requires less effort." "The most reliable method is to be a spy." "That is dishonorable. I want to obtain wealth, but I am unwilling to sin or work." The old man sighed and said, "Then it is difficult!"

### Black Brothers (8)

— Yimu

The pot made another sound, saying: "Come, Grell, my child! I am still beautiful, quickly pour me out." But Grell was extremely surprised and stood there motionless. The voice, with some impatience, shouted again: "I tell you, quickly pour me out." Grell was still motionless. The voice, with a pleading tone, said: "Can you pour me out? I am really too hot."

Grell steadied himself, and only then did his hands begin to move. He took the pot off the stove and slowly poured out the molten gold. But what was poured out was not liquid gold, but first two beautiful golden legs stretched out, followed by the lower hem of a robe, then a pair of small arms were seen, and finally the head of his old friend, the gold cup. These legs, robe hem, arms, and head rolled out of the pot one by one, and when they reached the ground, they mixed together and transformed into a golden dwarf, about one and a half feet tall.

The dwarf said happily, "This is good!" He first stretched out his legs, then his arms, and then shook his head up and down several times, for about five minutes, constantly stopping, as if testing whether all parts of his body were assembled correctly. Grell watched silently, extremely surprised. The dwarf wore a tight-fitting garment woven from gold thread, woven very finely, the triangular luster flashing as if it were the surface of a pearl. His hair and beard draped down from the garment, long and thin, intertwined, Grell simply could not see the end of it, seeming to blend with the air. However, his face was not as refined as his clothing and hair, but rather rough, and the color was somewhat like copper.

After examining himself, the dwarf fixed his sharp little eyes directly on Grell's face for a full minute or two before speaking, "Grell, my child, this is impossible." Grell was startled by these words and did not know what he meant. He followed his tone and said gently, "Sir, impossible?" The dwarf replied, "Yes, impossible." As he spoke, he pressed his hat over his eyebrows, made two spins in the room, lifting his legs high and landing heavily.

Grell looked at him for a while, felt that there was no reason to be afraid, and asked tentatively, "Sir, are you my gold cup?" The dwarf suddenly turned around, walked straight in front of Grell, straightened his body, and said loudly, "I am the King of the Golden River." After saying this, he made two big spins, returned to Grell, and stood still, as if waiting for Grell's response. Grell had to say softly, "I hope everything is well with you."

The dwarf ignored his polite greeting and said to himself, "Listen! I am what you mortals call the King of the Golden River. I was transformed into the shape you saw me in before by a spell of a more powerful king. Being melted by you in the pot has freed me. I have seen the actions of you and your two evil brothers, which has made me willing to help you; you should also listen to my words and do as I say."

### On Flags in Peking Opera

— Junmei

Peking Opera is based on singing, and every movement contains elements of dance, so the props used in the opera are those that are easy to manipulate. Flags are also one of the main props in Peking Opera, mainly used to represent the movement of troops, battles, and the direction of officials in the opera. Wind, clouds, rain, snow, yin and yang, and orientation are also often symbolized by flags. The audience can understand them at a glance. There are many types of flags that are commonly seen but not noticed, such as red gate flags, black gate flags, water flags, and chariot flags. A brief description is as follows:

Red Gate Flag: The red gate flag is made of red cloth without colorful paintings. It is widely used to represent auspicious occasions, such as the red phoenix star in "Red Phoenix Joy," and the parade of the top scholar and weddings. It is always used as a guide in front. When the god of fire appears, it is sometimes used because the color red contains the meaning of fire. Also, if a character in the opera is beheaded, this flag is used to wrap their gauze hat or chignon, also to represent dripping red blood.

Black Gate Flag: The black gate flag is also called the wind flag. It is square and black. If there is a strong wind in the opera scene, this flag is waved on the stage, hence the name. It is used to represent ghosts traveling by wind, such as when Tuo Zhao Peng Bei and Qi Lang appear, four people hold black flags in front. It also represents an ominous meaning, hence the name black gate flag.

Water Flag: The water flag is made of white cloth, with water patterns painted on it, representing water waves. When there is drowning, rescue, or naval battles, this flag is used.

Chariot Flag: The chariot flag has a wheel shape painted on the flag surface. One person holds two flags and walks in the middle, representing the arrival of a chariot. Those who ride in chariots in the opera are mostly female characters. Only Zhu Wanliang is a male character.

The above four flags are commonly seen in Peking Opera. In recent years, male warrior characters, in addition to being brave and fierce, have been waving colorful silk flags, which are colorful and dazzling. It is unknown what meaning is taken from using them in dangerous battles.

### Casting of "Dream of the Red Chamber" Confirmed: Chen Yunshang Cross-Dresses as Jia Baoyu, Yuan Meiyun and Chen Yanyan to Play Lin Daiyu and Xue Baochai Respectively

— Yinbing

The Xinhua Film Company's plan to produce the entire "Dream of the Red Chamber" dates back to three years ago. They had been considering it for a long time, but hesitated due to the scale of the project. It was not until recently that they put the original plan into practice. There are several major difficulties in the filming of this film. (1) Script - The plot of the book is complex and extremely trivial. Dividing and organizing it into segments while trying to avoid dullness and vulgarity makes the work of shot division very difficult. (2) Background - The Grand View Garden is full of layered pavilions, magnificent and luxurious, making the set construction extremely vast. (3) Actors - There are many characters in the book, and there are even more female roles below the Twelve Beauties. It is not easy to find actors who fit the personalities and allocate them appropriately. For these three issues, Xinhua has experts draft the script; the set uses the entire grounds of the Dingxiang Garden, which is fortunately full of flowers and trees, making it twice as effective with half the effort; and the allocation of important actors has been largely determined: the only central character, Jia Baoyu, will be cross-dressed by Chen Yunshang. Lin Daiyu will be played by Yuan Meiyun, who has a delicate physique, Xue Baochai will be played by Chen Yanyan, who has a plump and jade-like appearance, and the role of Wang Xifeng will still be played by Gu Lanjun, who played in "Havoc in Ningguo Mansion."

Having a female actor cross-dress as Jia Baoyu is indeed a better solution. Because there are very few talented young male actors suitable for playing the refined and romantic Jia Baoyu, it is absolutely impossible to find one. "Dream of the Red Chamber" focuses on depicting the love between brothers and sisters, and if Baoyu is played by a male actor, it is inevitable that it will be difficult to perform a more passionate and thorough performance. Chen Yunshang is charming, lively, and still has a bit of masculine energy; playing this role is very suitable, and it seems like a unique flavor of "Girl Incarnation," which is enough to make the "Dream of the Red Chamber" film a great success.

### Examination of "Chopping the Classics Hall" (7)

— Xiaotian

"Chopping the Classics Hall," also known as "Wu Han Kills His Wife," tells the story of the late Wang Mang period. The opera includes scenes such as Liu Xiu fleeing the country, being captured at Tongguan, lecturing his son on injustice, Wu Han killing his wife, the virtuous mother exhausting her virtue, and abandoning Mang to return to Han. Wu Han's wife is the daughter of Wang Mang, a member of the Xin Dynasty's royalty. The entire opera is sung in a minor key. It became quite popular after Qilin Tong played the lead role, and it was later made into a film. According to the "Book of the Later Han Dynasty, Biography of Wu Han": "Wu Han, courtesy name Ziyan, was a native of Wancheng in Nanyang. His family was poor, and he served the county as a pavilion chief. At the end of Wang Mang's reign, he violated the law as a guest, so he fled to Yuyang. Lacking funds, he made a living by selling horses, traveling between Yan and Ji. Everywhere he went, he made connections with heroes. When Gengshi was established, he sent an envoy, Han Hong, to inspect Hebei. Someone said to Hong, 'Wu Ziyan is a remarkable man who can be consulted. Hong summoned Wu Han and was very pleased with him, so he appointed him as the magistrate of Anle." It is said that Wu Han only served as an official under Gengshi. During Wang Mang's reign, he was a horse trader. How could he marry a princess and be called a prince consort? The biography also states, "When Wang Lang rose up, the northern states were disturbed. Wu Han had long heard that Guangwu was a virtuous man and wanted to return to him alone. So he persuaded the governor Peng Chong, saying, 'The cavalry of Yuyang and Shanggu are known throughout the world. Why don't you combine the elite troops of the two commanderies and attach them to Duke Liu to attack Handan? This is a great opportunity. (Omission) Chong agreed, so he sent Wu Han to lead troops and join forces with the generals of Shanggu to the south. Everywhere they went, they attacked and killed Wang Lang's leaders. Guangwu at Guang'a appointed Wu Han as a partial general and granted him the title of Marquis of Jian Ce." From this, it can be seen that Wu Han's return to Han and his uprising took place in Yuyang, and his audience took place in Guang'a. His meritorious deeds were persuading Peng Chong to attack Wang Lang. None of this can be borrowed or associated with the plot of "Chopping the Classics Hall." Some say that the compilation of this opera is likely from "Romance of the Eastern Han Dynasty" (I have not seen it and do not know if it is true). I don't know where "Romance of the Eastern Han Dynasty" is based on.

### Dynamics of Hua Guo Drama School

— Heyun

Recently, the liveliness of spoken drama seems to have become a special ornament on the isolated island. This phenomenon can be said to have broken historical records. In fact, drama - especially spoken drama - is a simple and powerful educational tool that can reflect life and society anytime and anywhere. So, in today's new era when the alarm bells are ringing all over the land, it is natural that it can be so vibrant. As a result, the emergence of drama clubs and drama troupes, the performance of famous plays, and the establishment of schools have given the people of the country great excitement.

At this time, the Hua Guo Drama School also met with the public. Hua Guo Drama School focuses on various academic subjects and skills within the scope of spoken drama. For example, directing, screenwriting, performance, makeup, dance, scenery, lighting, effects, etc., are still under training, hoping to cultivate specialized talents in a short period of time.

Now, Hua Guo has officially started classes, with more than 40 male and female students. It is said that currently, in addition to attending classes, they are also rehearsing a famous one-act play, which is said to be performed at the Xuan Palace Theater in the near future.

### Unofficial History of the Pear Garden

— Xu Muyun

Yang Xiaolou Admires Li Chunlai (Part 2)

When Li performed Bai Shui Tan, he played the role of the Eleventh Young Master. Wearing a straw hat ring, after reciting "Seeing death and not saving is not a true man," he stood at the edge of the stage and first bowed. When his head was raised, the straw hat ring had already flown to the top of the stage. At that time, there were two people above who were specifically responsible for catching the hat. The one who caught it would be rewarded with two yuan after the show. If both failed, they would be severely punished by Li. Also, when Li had no show during the day, he often personally supervised the acrobatic troupe's training, holding a cigar in one hand and a whip in the other. Whenever he ordered someone to do a somersault, he would call out "One more, one more" non-stop. The person performing the somersault had to continuously somersault according to his voice. If there was any delay, or if they were ordered to somersault but had no strength, they would be whipped by Li. Chunlai became famous in Shanghai during his prime with the play "Bai Shui Tan." Therefore, one day when Li was scheduled to perform the play, Xiaolou arrived at the backstage an hour early, constantly peeking out from behind the curtain. Chunlai was naturally extra enthusiastic. When he threw the straw hat ring, he still didn't use his hands, wanting to show off his skill with his head. Although he was old at that time and lowered it slightly, this unique skill was still something that others couldn't do. (The Tianchan Terrace was high, so he had to have someone catch it in front of the curtain) Also, when the male and net characters were fighting, each held one end of a stick (in fact, the stick represents the shoulder pole used by the Eleventh Young Master to carry meat, but it is used as a weapon during battle). The male and net characters simultaneously did a somersault in place, rising and falling together, extremely fast. After standing still, they were not out of breath or shaking, and you couldn't see that he was an old man over sixty. After he finished the scene, as soon as he stepped into the backstage, Boss Yang rushed to his side, took Chunlai's hand, then stretched out his thumb several times, and called out repeatedly, "Old hero, old hero." Chunlai certainly had a proud look on his face, and Ju Dekui (who played Qingmianhu), who was acting with the old man, also felt very honored.

### How to Relieve the Economic Hardship of Families: Focusing on the Big Picture and Addressing the Details

— Wind

Family problems have currently become the most serious general problem. This is a unique wartime phenomenon that cannot be addressed with conventional methods. In peacetime, every family has a normal income, and prices are at a certain level. When family finances run into trouble, it's usually due to poor management or unnecessary waste by family members. In that case, the most important solution is for individuals to adjust their spending habits. However, the current situation is different. Due to soaring prices, most families, even with maximum austerity measures, are unable to maintain their livelihood. The reason for this is not individual fault but the result of societal factors. Therefore, trying to solve the problem from an individual perspective is futile. It requires a collective solution from society.

Generally speaking, when war breaks out in any country, the government controls essential daily necessities such as food and fuel. They make advance estimates of stockpiles. If there is a surplus, they figure out how to handle it. If there is a shortage, they figure out how to allocate it. They also set maximum prices to prevent the price of essential daily necessities from rising and strictly prohibit speculation to avoid market chaos. Shanghai, in its unique situation, never took this step. Last year, local authorities imposed price limits on food, but this was merely a belated effort after the fact, not proactive planning. This year, market chaos has resumed, and the price limits on rice have long been broken. The soaring price of coal also cannot be stopped. Although warehouses are stocked with large quantities of coal, the warehouse receipts are in the hands of speculators who use them to manipulate and hoard. Each ton of coal costs over two hundred yuan, causing the price of coal to skyrocket, resulting in an unprecedented situation. Despite efforts by business leaders to suppress prices, the results have been limited.

Strictly punishing speculation is undoubtedly the most important measure right now. However, this passive approach alone cannot solve the current problem of soaring prices. It still requires the concession authorities and business leaders to raise substantial funds to investigate existing stockpiles of essential goods. If there is a shortage, they should purchase in large quantities to stabilize prices. The Shanghai People's Food Adjustment Committee's fundraising and group purchase of rice can be considered the most successful collective action in adjusting rice prices recently. However, this method is not widespread enough. Those who can afford to buy ten yuan's worth of rice are, by definition, not within the reach of the average middle-class person. The lines for subsidized rice stretching half a mile long are filled with people who can only afford to buy five or ten liters of rice at a time to make ends meet. They certainly cannot afford to buy a stone or two of rice to store at home for consumption. The group purchase of rice inevitably excludes these people. Subsidized rice sales are of great help to these people, but this measure needs to be sustained. Subsidized sales are implemented during peak price surges but are suspended when the situation calms down slightly. This is not a thorough solution. Therefore, this problem should be comprehensively planned to achieve widespread and significant results. This can be done in several ways: First, employers of major companies and factories in Shanghai can allocate funds from their surplus to purchase essential daily necessities and sell them to their employees at prices lower than the market rate, without the aim of profit. This is a simple effort for employers, while employees can purchase daily necessities at much lower prices than the market. Second, since the start of the war, Shanghai has been flooded with idle capital, which is not being used properly and is mostly used for manipulation and speculation. If this idle capital could be used for investment in consumer cooperatives, similar to past credit cooperatives, it would be many times more beneficial to social welfare. During this period, the organization of consumer cooperatives is essential to promote. However, cooperation should not be limited to consumer cooperatives. Other cooperative ventures, such as medical cooperatives to improve personal health, educational cooperatives to educate children and reduce personal burdens, and thrift cooperatives, can all help with family finances and should also be promoted. Furthermore, the basic spirit of cooperatives is so-called democracy. At a time when constitutionalism is being promoted, the organization of these cooperatives is also a good way to cultivate the spirit of democracy. This is also more worthy of our promotion and joint research to find a more reasonable solution to family finances in today's abnormal society.

### Adjusting Family Finances

— Yan Zheng

It is impossible to separate family and society completely. Similarly, family finances are constantly influenced by social economics. In the current extraordinary times and environment, the impact of social economics on family finances is particularly evident. Family budgets are constantly disrupted by soaring prices and skyrocketing rents. In order to survive, people must desperately seek adjustments to family finances. This situation is especially acute among those who live on meager salaries. They have no permanent assets, no guarantees. Those with weaker wills take their income and gamble it all, and the outcome is naturally failure. Therefore, in order to adjust family finances, the first step is to improve the social economy, such as curbing prices and stabilizing rents. In addition, the following points may be helpful for regulating family finances:

(1) Cooperatives: Joining a cooperative is very beneficial for family finances. Many organizations in this city have fraternities. Some of these organizations have affiliated cooperatives. Each person contributes one or two yuan to become a shareholder and regularly enjoys the benefits of group purchases of rice, coal, and daily necessities. At the end of the year, dividends can also be distributed, which can make up for the lack of individual financial resources. (If there are no such organizations in your unit, please establish them quickly, initiated by the leaders of your unit or organized by the employees themselves!)

(2) Exchanging Goods: I remember that a women's group in this city once had such an organization. They exchanged what they didn't need for what others didn't need, killing two birds with one stone and very convenient. This can also be achieved through industry fraternities, which can be very helpful for family finances.

(3) Production: Currently, if you only reduce spending without increasing income, family finances will only become tighter and life will only become more difficult. But increasing income is really not easy! The most legitimate ways are: writing articles, taking on extra copying work, becoming a night school teacher, etc. In addition to the above occupations (or if they are unable to take on the above occupations), women can weave some handmade products for others. Recently, a group of people, seeing the growing demand for Chinese handicrafts in the United States, advertised for skilled and unskilled female workers. The advantage is that they can take the weaving home to do, which does not interfere with routine housework. The wage for each pair is at least five or six jiao, and up to one or two yuan. Weaving one pair a day can be quite substantial in a month.

(4) Entertainment: Although, within possible limits, it is still necessary to seek physical and mental pleasure. To seek physical and mental pleasure, nothing is better than reading. It can cultivate the temperament and increase intelligence. The Xinya Library on the third floor of the Cishu Building allows you to borrow books for free for a long time by paying a security deposit of one or two yuan. (If you don't borrow, the security deposit can be requested to be returned at any time.) It is very suitable for saving money. As for the children, they can be taken to a nearby children's park on Sundays, which allows the adults to relieve the fatigue of the week without spending a penny!

### Suppressing Material Enjoyment

— Yu Chayun

The prosperity or decline of family finances is certainly based on the prosperity or decline of social economics and the balance of supply and demand of goods. However, the economic management of a family should have considerable autonomy because material enjoyment in life is compressible. However, in Shanghai today, especially among the lower and middle classes, the economic control of every family can be said to be entirely in the hands of a few wealthy people. In short, our lives are controlled by hoarders and market manipulators of daily necessities.

Under this social reality, we certainly cannot sit idly and wait for death. We must struggle and seek a livelihood. Although the methods vary from family to family, the main methods are nothing more than: in terms of spirit, sticking together through thick and thin (family members); in terms of enjoyment, cutting from the surplus and supplementing the deficit to balance the difference between income and expenditure. However, these two methods are easier said than done. The former requires understanding, and the latter requires considerable time to cultivate. If you only talk about saving when prices are high, then the anxiety and distress of "digging a well when thirsty" will be difficult to endure. Because I started saving two years ago, I don't feel much pain in the current difficult environment, even though I only have an income of fifty yuan to support a family of four. This is not because of my far-sightedness, but because of the stimulation of the objective environment. Many of my relatives and friends were unemployed or on leave of absence after August 13th. They still had to eat unnecessary food and wear unnecessary clothes in their daily lives, and at the same time, their hearts were filled with unnecessary worries! This is what is called "pretending to be fat by swelling your face." Therefore, I constantly asked myself: What if I lost my job?

Therefore, since then, I have been planning ahead and practicing "training my appetite," reducing the number of meat dishes from three to two and the number of vegetable dishes from three to two, and then reducing it to one meat dish and two vegetable dishes after three months. From last summer to now, it has been one vegetable dish. At first, it was very uncomfortable, but I gradually got used to it. Therefore, now that everything is expensive, the impact on me is indeed limited.

Now that rice, coal, oil, etc. are expensive, my income of fifty yuan (plus a temporary subsidy of eight yuan) is still enough to cope. Each month, in addition to the rent of ten yuan, the remaining forty-eight yuan is allocated as follows: half a dan of rice twenty yuan, coal briquettes about eighty city catties four yuan eight jiao (seal the furnace opening with coal dross and water when the midday meal is finished), four catties of oil four yuan, one vegetable dish a day one jiao, a total of three yuan, children's tuition five yuan, other expenses such as soap and matches another three yuan, leaving more than eight yuan for shoes, socks, and socializing.

This is still the actual situation of current price expenditures. Several months ago, when prices were not so expensive, I was living like this, and the savings I had accumulated have not been touched. From now on, I will certainly continue to practice eating hardships. In view of the results of past savings, I now want to save more to avoid future pain. I will not only not make new clothes, but in the future, I also want to mix some yams and taro into the rice to reduce the consumption of rice. As for movies, cigarettes, playing cards, hiring maids, eating snacks, perming hair, cosmetics, and all other unconscious consumption, I will certainly maintain the plan from two years ago and completely abstain.

### Can Save · Cannot Save

The nutrients in tofu and green vegetables are not inferior to fish and meat, but the price difference is very large.

Clothing material can be saved, sewing thread cannot be saved

With sewing thread, old clothes can be mended, no need to add new clothes

Watching plays can be saved, buying books cannot be saved

Reading can increase knowledge, which is more beneficial than watching plays, and a book can be read by many people, which is most economical

Cigarettes can be saved, newspapers cannot be saved

Cigarettes are harmful and useless, saving that money to buy a newspaper is more than enough, and old newspapers can also be sold, at least half of the newspaper fee can be recovered.

Taking a vehicle can be saved, shoes and socks cannot be saved

Taking a vehicle costs money, walking more may damage shoes and socks, but it is beneficial to the body.

Candy can be saved, toys cannot be saved

Children eat too much candy, which is wasteful and useless. If you save that money to buy toys, it can greatly increase children's interest.

Cosmetics can be saved, soap cannot be saved

Soap is necessary for bathing and cleaning, women only need to be clean, why need heavy makeup?

Drinking alcohol can be saved, tea cannot be saved

When friends come and go, a cup of tea is enough to talk, why need wine and meat?

### Common Sense of Family Economics: Waste Utilization

— Zhang Zhenshan

In recent months, social life in Shanghai has been elevated two or three times, or even seven or eight times beyond the standard, due to the endless rise in prices, causing the production and consumption of the majority of citizens to be very far apart. In this difficult environment, in order to balance the difference between income and expenditure, in addition to hoping that the authorities will curb the abnormally rising prices, we can only fully utilize time (that is, manpower) and waste to resist its threat and stabilize family finances.

Currently, the most threatening thing to us is rice and coal. Regarding coal, we can use garbage to reduce the consumption of coal briquettes. The method is to store the garbage swept up every day in an old jar. When there is a considerable amount, remove the soil from it, soak the combustible residue with water, mix in a little coal dross (which can be left over from the place where coal briquettes are piled), stir evenly, make it into a coal briquette shape, and expose it to sunlight. After it dries, it can be used. Each furnace of coal briquettes can be configured with four-tenths (that is, six real coal briquettes and four garbage coal briquettes) to burn together, and the firepower will not be weakened.

Secondly, the peels and roots peeled from vegetables can also be used, don't throw them away. After washing them with water, cut them into granules and cook them with rice. After becoming rice, eating it can not only reduce the consumption of rice, but also has a fragrant aroma, and often has sufficient life elements for the body to absorb. After using towels for a long time, the broken places must be in the center, while the four sides and both ends are intact. You can cut them open from the middle, divide them into two sections, sew the two ends together with warp threads, change the center to the two ends, and change the two ends to the center. Then trim the broken part, and it is another good towel, but it is only shortened in length. Even if it is not used to wash the face, it can also be used to wash dishes, wipe tables, and wipe glass. Toothbrushes and peach pits that are broken to the point where they cannot be used again can be used as tools for wiping leather shoes. Biscuit tins can be made into coal briquette stoves. When clothes are broken to the point where they cannot be worn, the intact parts can be disassembled, disinfected with boiling water, and made into face towels or children's bibs. In short, there is no waste in the family. Every item has two or three uses, it only depends on whether people are willing to use it and me. If we save everywhere and utilize everything, it will not only benefit family finances, but also have the effect of indirectly assisting the authorities in curbing prices.

### A Gain in Saving

— Chen

There are many ways to save money. The author has thought of two:

(1) According to economics, the measurement of the utility of things is divided into value and price. For example, porridge can relieve hunger, which is its permanent and unchanging value. If there are many monks and little porridge, its "price" will be expensive; conversely, if there is a lot of porridge and few monks, its "price" will be cheap. In other words, the price changes according to the law of supply and demand, but the value does not. Because we are concerned about price, we can take advantage of this point. To give an example: recently, yellow croakers have just come on the market, and the price is of course expensive. We will wait until yellow croakers come in large quantities before eating them. The nutrition is the same, but the price is much cheaper. When the yellow croakers gradually decrease later, the price will gradually increase again. We can use the pickled cheap yellow croakers to take care of them, although the taste is a little worse. This is the meaning of "pickling" in economics. Similarly, the most abundant Chinese mitten crabs in autumn can be made into drunken crabs in winter, the most abundant Chinese cabbage in winter can be made into pickled vegetables in spring, or it can be made into the dried mustard greens made by people in Shaoxing. It is a matter of lifting a hand and saving a lot of money.

(2) Don't throw away things that are still useful. These things are usually called "waste," but they still have some use, so we don't use the word "waste" here. For example, food cans can be sold to junk collectors if you don't want to keep them, which is also worth a few cents; or they can be used as containers for storing small foods. Also, garbage that is considered completely useless can be fermented to generate biogas for lighting, but this requires setting it up. Also, during the New Year, almost every family eats some peanuts and melon seeds. The shells of this kind of snack can be used as fuel. There is an old saying: "A doctor does not discard even cow urine and horse manure." You should always pay attention to the so-called "waste utilization."

### "Wartime Bread"

— Chuan

Looking with open eyes, the current difficult living conditions in Shanghai are actually common historical facts. The only difference is that in various countries, there is no rampant yellow-belly among manipulators and speculators like in Shanghai. During the last war, at the beginning of the war, the Allied countries rumored that Germany was about to experience a food panic. However, because of Germany's strict control of food, the people did not suffer from hunger in a short period of time as the Allied countries imagined. After the start of the war, Germany established price limits and bread regulations. Thus, there was the so-called "wartime bread" regulation, which restricted all bakers from adding rye flour below a certain percentage when making white flour bread, and from adding sweet potato flour below a certain percentage when making rye flour bread. This kind of bread was eaten by common people, the German Emperor and Empress at the time, and the Crown Prince at the front. Germany's food supply felt insufficient at the beginning of the war due to the Allied countries' naval blockade, but the reason why it was able to support for ten years was because the government had effective control and the people saved in terms of food. Under the current special circumstances in Shanghai, government control is of course beyond its power. Shanghai citizens should use collective strength to sanction speculators in order to improve personal economics. At the same time, those few writing classes should also save material resources and contribute them to the country.

### A Brief Discussion on Clothing Handling

— Ms. Jin Juqing

For housewives living in the city, there are many things to pay attention to in terms of daily measures, whether at home or out, in terms of economics and other rationalization. Regarding the item of clothing, the author has a few items based on personal experience, or what she usually gets from talking with relatives and friends:

1. Woolen clothes should not be worn close to the body, because woolen things are often washed and easily shrink, not washing is not hygienic, and the animal category of fiber is easy to make the skin itchy.

2. For clothes with linings, it is best to use real silk. If the lining of old clothes is real silk, do not discard it. If you use two layers of old lining, slightly nail them straight with thread and put them inside the new lining to form a three-layer lining garment, which can resist the warmth of thin cotton clothes, and is light and close-fitting.

3. Clothes and socks should be washed frequently. Underwear and socks are best changed every day. You don't need to use much force when washing, and you can also save soap. Night clothes should be made of cotton cloth and must be loose. Old clothes are also acceptable. Do not wear socks when sleeping. If so, the clothes and socks will always be new and durable, and hygienic.

4. After washing clothes and scarves, they should be dried in the sun and ironed with an iron. This is not only related to beauty, but also heat can kill bacteria. It is most inappropriate to stick a washed scarf on a glass window or tile. Cotton clothes and cotton quilts must also be often dried in the sun.

5. When laying the bed in winter, first lay five or six old newspapers on the reed bed (the Shen Bao paper is good and not easy to break), and then lay the mattress on top. The paper is a non-heat-transmitting and windproof material, and can protect the mattress from rubbing against the reed bed.

Conditions for Buying Light Bulbs

Light bulbs are something used in every household. But light bulbs are used to generate electricity, so whether the light bulb can save electricity is very worthy of our attention. Many people think that to save money, you only need to buy cheap light bulbs. In fact, each light bulb should emit full brightness. For example, a 25-watt light bulb should emit 25 watts of light. If it can only emit 20 watts of light, then the electricity bill for 5 watts is wasted. If a 15-watt light bulb uses 30 watts of electricity to emit 25 watts of light, it will cost 5 watts more in electricity bills. Therefore, many self-righteous people think that buying a few cheap light bulbs is saving a lot of money, but in fact they are losing a lot of money invisibly. Therefore, to seek true economy, when using light bulbs, you must not only calculate the price of the light bulb.

### Wartime Commodity Controls

— Huan

(1) Hong Kong's Price Controls

As the saying goes, "Even a clever woman cannot cook without rice." Therefore, at this time when rice is as precious as pearls and firewood as cinnamon, in addition to everyone and every family practicing thrift, there must also be a responsible authority to strictly implement control. Otherwise, no matter how economical, it is impossible to get through this difficult time.

Although there are so-called "price limits" in Shanghai, unscrupulous merchants are outwardly compliant but inwardly resistant, and there are no practical results. As for the organization of control agencies, there is none at all. Recently, I heard that the French Concession is organizing a committee to suppress prices, which is good news for the citizens. We are "on tiptoe hoping for it."

In Hong Kong, the ordinance on controlling commodity prices was promulgated after the outbreak of the European War, so the phenomenon of commodity prices soaring into the sky has not occurred to this day. For example, recently, White Pagoda oil is sold for one yuan and three jiao per pound, fourteen ounces of Condensed Milk five jiao per can, Lutu Fine Milk Powder one yuan one jiao and nine cents per pound, and California Shata fish three jiao and seven cents per can. Other rice and necessary items are even less likely to be hoarded for speculation. Therefore, we very much hope that the Shanghai authorities will quickly establish this kind of control agency.

(2) Food Restrictions in England During the Last European War

During World War I, England followed nutritional principles. Within the scope of not harming health, the weekly food for adults, in addition to eating 12 ounces of grains, 2 pounds of meat, 10 ounces of fatty substances such as butter, vegetable oil, and lard, and 8 ounces of sugar, the weight of bread was as follows:

Men doing heavy work: 8 pounds

Men doing ordinary industrial work: 7 pounds

Men doing desk work: 4 pounds and 8 ounces

Women doing heavy work: 5 pounds

Women doing ordinary work: 4 pounds

Women doing desk work: 3 pounds and 8 ounces

### A Budget Survey of a Salaried Worker

— Li Shi

The following table lists the results obtained by sorting out the household accounts of the author — a salaried worker — over the past five years. The figures in the table are the percentage distribution of the average monthly actual expenditures for various living expenses each year, and the actual numbers are not listed. Because the purpose of this article is to provide a budget distribution ratio for the family living expenses of a salaried worker, and then analyze the changes in their living standards. Since this report is investigative in nature, listing the actual numbers seems meaningless.

Percentage Distribution of Average Monthly Expenditures for Various Living Expenses

The living expenses listed in the above table are divided into five categories: food, clothing, rent, fuel, and miscellaneous items, according to the research practices of living expenses in various countries at the beginning of accounting. The rent includes lighting and water, which is mostly the case for those who rent houses in Shanghai. Fuel is used for heating and cooking. Miscellaneous items are further divided into subscriptions, books, adding furniture, medical and health care, socializing and entertainment, and other miscellaneous expenses such as maid's wages and special expenses such as travel expenses or loans. This item is determined according to the actual budget of the author's family, and there is no fixed standard. It should also be stated that there has been no increase or decrease in the author's salary during these five years.
