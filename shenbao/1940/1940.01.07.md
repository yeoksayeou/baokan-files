### British Bonds Market Price Firm, Reaching Wartime Peak

London: British government securities today almost reached their highest level since the start of the war. Various circles in the city are paying close attention to the tight prices of government bonds. Some now also point out that the strength of British bonds is an indication that the government will issue national defense bonds soon. However, when inquiring among important figures in banks and stock exchanges, only a few hold the above view. The factors that have created the firm market price of securities are now described as follows: (1) The new capital market has been closed since the start of the war, and investors have no other investment avenues, so there is no motivation to sell bonds. (2) Companies currently have a large amount of funds. As for the official raising of bond market prices in order to issue new bonds, there is currently no such indication. However, the authorities may issue short-term bonds to banks so that banks can circulate treasury bills and supply the funds needed until March 31, 1940. It is generally believed that banks have a large number of existing funds and treasury bills, so it is not difficult to absorb 300 million pounds of short-term bonds. (6th Reuters Dispatch)

Editorial

### The Current Problem of Local Self-Government

Last winter, the Sixth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang resolved to convene the National Assembly this year to formulate a constitution and implement constitutional government early. Thus, local self-government has once again become a pressing issue. Local self-government is the foundation for implementing constitutional government. As explained by Chairman Chiang in the previous session of the National Political Council, it must continue to be promoted even after the constitution is promulgated. How much more so now, when we are actively preparing for the constitutional process, should we focus on this fundamental work? Originally, local self-government in China was based on the county as the unit. Therefore, before the constitution was drafted, the "Outline of County-Level Organizations" was first established, and it was announced that local self-government would be implemented starting in March of this year. Not only that, but in Sichuan Province, where the wartime capital is located, it has also been decided to implement it as soon as possible to serve as a model for other provinces.

From a historical perspective, the origins of local self-government in China can be traced back to the 'division of land and establishment of wells' and the 'establishment of steps to measure mu' of the Yellow Emperor. This is too far back. In the late Qing Dynasty, local self-government was of course also a necessary element of the so-called "preparation for constitutional monarchy"; and among the political systems of the early Republic of China, there was even more of a prototype of local self-government; following the old ways and making superficial changes, everything vanished in an instant. In the three to five years after the eighteenth year of the Republic of China, the central and local governments once took the promotion of local self-government as their primary task, but in practice, they only managed to divide autonomous regions and prepare autonomous organizations. Precisely because local self-government is the preliminary work of constitutional government rather than the most basic work, it is the fundamental work rather than superficial work, it is very difficult to complete; especially during the difficult times of the nation, with repeated setbacks.

Recent local self-government that deserves comparison and consideration for the present: (1) In the twenty-first year of the Republic of China, the Nanchang Headquarters issued a directive to all provinces within the bandit suppression area to first implement Baojia as a temporary solution. Other provinces also followed suit one after another, so that the original work of promoting self-government gradually slowed down. As a result, self-government and Baojia formed a confrontational state. The Baojia system is to handle local security, and according to the county self-government law revised by the previous Legislative Yuan, county security matters are one of the main political affairs of county self-government; therefore, Baojia was originally a part of self-government, and Baojia should be accommodated within the self-government organization. Now, the "Outline of County-Level Organizations" stipulates that Baojia is attached to the township organization, which is what is meant by this. Some contemporary commentators believe that the Baojia system is conducive to managing people, but not necessarily conducive to managing affairs; that there are too many levels of self-government, and that handling affairs is inevitably hindered. They do not know that during the War of Resistance, wherever enemy cavalry arrived, villages were often reduced to ruins, and it was difficult for the small villagers in the countryside to cling to one corner as in peacetime. If the Baojia and self-government organizations are integrated into one, it will not only be easier for the state to conscript soldiers, but also people from Jia can drift to Yi and still organize at any time, without being limited by geographical area. This is a necessary condition for handling wartime local self-government and should not be taken lightly.

(2) The National Government previously organized the Central Local Self-Government Planning Committee, which formulated the procedure for the implementation of self-government as three stages: (A) fostering self-government, (B) starting self-government, and (C) completing self-government. In the first stage, the county mayors are appointed by the government according to law, and a county council is established. Township chiefs are elected by the people of their respective districts, and the county magistrate selects one for appointment. In the second stage, the county mayors are still appointed by the government, and the county councilors and township chiefs are elected by the people. In the third stage, all of the above personnel are elected by the people. But the situation varies from place to place, and the environment is very different, especially during military periods, there is a distinction between occupied areas, guerrilla areas and safe areas. The central government should only make flexible regulations so that they can be adapted to local conditions and times. The division of autonomous regions is most closely related to the promotion of self-government. Before the division, of course, an overall plan must be made based on geography, history, customs, transportation, products, and so on. These measures, in theory, seem impossible to be taken lightly during wartime, but in many places, precisely because of the impact of the war, traffic is obstructed, and people are displaced. If this kind of autonomous region remains the same as before, it will be no different from "building a car behind closed doors." Isn't it ridiculous to plan self-government for the people in the occupied areas? To remedy this, it seems that the administrative commissioner and the county magistrate should conduct investigations nearby and properly revise them. The election of township chiefs cannot but be approved by the higher authorities for the commissioner and county magistrate to send trained personnel as self-government instructors to go to various places to guide them separately.

(3) The County Organization Law of the 17th year of the Republic of China adopted a four-level system of districts, townships, villages, and neighborhoods. There were too many levels! It was difficult to implement, and the affairs of districts and townships were mostly duplicated, which was superfluous. The recent "Outline of County-Level Organizations" stipulates that it should be one level of township, which corrects this shortcoming. The fact that it attaches Baojia to the township organization is in line with the needs of wartime, as mentioned above. But these are still only regulations in principle. In addition to dividing autonomous regions, how to conduct household registration, handle personnel registration, how to reorganize land and approve land prices; how to consider both matters entrusted by the central government and local matters; how to raise self-government funds. All of these must be done in parallel and complement each other. It is not a simple matter in itself, and it is even more difficult to stabilize the local situation. I still remember in early February of last year, it was widely reported that the central government was planning to (1) restore the administrative institutions in the guerrilla war zones, (2) implement militarization of the organizations of the governments of provinces, cities, and counties, (3) select outstanding youth to participate in improving local administrative work, and (4) establish training centers for local administrative cadres in various provinces. These plans may have been implemented or not. We deeply feel that to implement local self-government, we still need to start with these necessary measures.

### U.S. Lawmakers Advocate Stricter Sanctions Against Japan; Propose Banning Arms and Raw Material Exports to Japan; Must Make Japan Stop Its Aggression Against China

Washington: Republican Congressman Alexander declared here yesterday that the United States must impose strong pressure on Japan to force Japan to stop its aggression against China, even if the imposition of strong pressure leads to war between Japan and the United States, it is still acceptable. Alexander and Democratic Senator Hugh Wiley Bach are well-known anti-Japanese figures in Congress. They stated that even if Japan agrees to guarantee U.S. interests in the Far East, the U.S. must still impose pressure on Japan to stop its aggression. The position they hold is that no matter how Japan treats U.S. interests in China, the U.S. must take retaliatory action against Japan because Japan is invading China. This concept is diametrically opposed to that announced by Senator Pittman, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who represents the official opinion. Pittman advocates punishing Japan to force Japan to recognize U.S. interests in the Far East. Alexander said that when he and the masses in the western and central states discussed the situation in Japan in the autumn, they found that they strongly supported punitive measures against Japan. The feelings of the American people are not based on commercial issues, but on the Japanese military's aggression against China. He said that we are currently facing two dangerous paths. We cannot adopt a "hands-off" policy towards the Far East. We cannot allow Japan to complete its aggression against China, Australia, New Zealand, India, and the Philippines in order to avoid direct conflict with Japan. The second path is to take a tough stance against Japan and impose a ban on arms and raw material exports to Japan, without considering the danger of war with Japan. Although this second path is more dangerous than the first "hands-off" policy in the near future, it is more appropriate in the long run. I believe that we will encounter a powerful enemy in terms of manpower and materials in the Pacific. Although Japan, the Soviet Union, and Germany are not allied, they have the same goals, so we must regard each of these countries as our enemy. As for Mr. Hugh Wiley Bach's statement that he will request Congress to immediately pass his proposed resolution to ban arms and raw material exports to Japan after the 1911 U.S.-Japan Treaty of Commerce expires on January 26. He said, "I do not agree with the generally held view that treaties can prevent the declaration of an embargo against Japan, but because the government feels that it is necessary to announce the abolition of the treaty, I agree to wait until June. I do not believe that an embargo should be considered to force Japan to make concessions to our country in China and the Far East. I mean, if Japan continues to violate the Nine-Power Treaty that our country has signed, our attitude should still be as before. My resolution is to punish any country that violates the Nine-Power Treaty and to prevent the American people from helping Japan to continue its aggression against China, whose territorial integrity our treaty must respect." The people of the western coast of the United States unanimously hope that the United States must condemn Japan's aggression against China and punish Japan. (6th United Press)

Tokyo: The Japanese government authorities do not hold a very pessimistic view of the anti-government movement of the Diet members from various factions in the House of Representatives. They believe that the mission of the current cabinet is to handle the China Incident, and the basic policy of the Japanese side to deal with the new regime in China has also been decided. The handling of the incident will soon have epoch-making progress, and the situation of the political parties is only that the Diet Members' Association is still taking a tough anti-government attitude. As for the leaders of the political parties, such as the leaders of the Minseitō Party, they have already stated their attitude, willing to maintain their original attitude, support the government, and cooperate with the government from outside the cabinet. Therefore, the current situation is not very pessimistic for the government. The government plans to ask cabinet members from political parties to make extra efforts to find out the exact situation of the political parties and break the deadlock, and plans to hold a meeting of the leaders of the five parties at an appropriate time to frankly express the government's true intentions and request understanding, in order to face the reopened parliament after the recess.

### Japanese Banker Talks About the Sino-Japanese War: Hopes for an Early End

London: Viscount Kanō, manager of the Yokohama Specie Bank's London branch, told a Reuters reporter here today that he believes that the Sino-Japanese conflict can be satisfactorily resolved in the short term. Japan has now reached a position where it can fairly claim that its economic demands on China have been satisfied. If economic readjustments are maintained, there is no reason why friendly relations between the two countries should not be restored. Japan has obtained a portion of the Chinese market it needs to sell its various goods and has been able to obtain raw materials produced in China. As for China's needs, especially steel products, Japan cannot supply them all. Therefore, China must continue to obtain supplies from Britain. The cessation of the war in China is beneficial to everyone. When asked whether a method of peaceful competition has been obtained between the Lancashire cloth industry and the Japanese cotton cloth industry, Kanō replied that, in his opinion, the two cotton cloth industries do not compete. The quality of the cotton cloth produced in Lancashire is far beyond that of the cotton cloth supplied by various Japanese export markets. Therefore, he believes that the two cotton cloth industries each have their own sales channels, and through mutual adjustment, both British and Japanese cotton cloth can find markets in China. The former is sold to classes with higher living standards, while the latter is sold to ordinary classes. Kanō later praised Britain's control of contraband and the authorities' confiscation of German exports, saying that Britain treats Japanese trade very fairly, and Japanese businesses are very grateful for it. The Japanese authorities have no intention of creating any situation that would disrupt the Allied control. It is reported that Kanō is scheduled to leave the UK for Japan on Saturday and is expected to return to London in March. (Reuters, 6th)

London: Mr. Purleigh, the former Shanghai correspondent for the Manchester Guardian, published an article in the newspaper today, commenting on the predictions of Viscount Kanō of Japan that the European War will reach a turning point favorable to the Allied countries at Easter and that the Sino-Japanese War will end within a month. He said that Kanō's optimism may not be without insight regarding Europe, but his estimate of the Sino-Japanese War is far from the mark. As Mr. Durdin, the New York Times correspondent in Chongqing, recently reported, China's manpower is still far above Japan's. Although transportation difficulties are increasing, a large number of supplies have been stored, and plans have been made for a large-scale counter-offensive in 1940. Unless China's independence and integrity are guaranteed, the Sino-Japanese War will continue. Mr. Tian also mentioned the issue of opening the Yangtze River, saying that economic cooperation to build a new order in East Asia is tantamount to agreeing to share the spoils, and he hopes that Britain will reject this proposal.

### Strike Wave Occurs on Farms in Pampanga Province, Philippines: 20,000 People Participate, Instigated by the Socialist Party; Government Authorities Are Now Engaged in Mediation

Manila: 20,000 farm laborers in Pampanga Province today launched a general strike under the direction of a socialist party, causing all agricultural activities in the province to come to a standstill. It is heard that the leader of the socialist party is a lawyer named Santos. The province has always been the region with the most labor disputes. However, according to the socialist party, the reason for the labor disputes in the region now is none other than the rivalry between the socialist party and the "Gawa" group organized by Provincial Governor Baluyut. There is a risk that the labor unrest will spread to Batangas Province, so Labor Minister Avelino has sent labor inspector Figueroa to Pampanga Province to mediate. At the same time, the government is also preparing to take high-handed measures against the strikers. It is heard that President Quezon met with the leaders of the socialist party, and Interior Minister Alunan also ordered the police to maintain order impartially. It is heard that in San Fernando, the police searched for weapons of those plotting riots. It is heard that three members of the socialist party were arrested for carrying weapons but were soon released. (Associated Press, 6th)

### Peace in India: German Propaganda Unreliable

London: The Times wrote today that recent German rumors of extreme disturbances on the northwestern border of India and serious riots in Waziristan are unreliable. In fact, the situation in Waziristan is now calmer than it was at the beginning of last year. Although there have been some kidnappings, robberies, and disturbances, they are not enough to cause concern to the Indian authorities. Recently, German newspapers have also reported that the Soviet Union is now planning to conquer the Middle East, and Muslims are deeply concerned about this. However, the Afghan government is well-informed about Central Asia and has not seen any special military action on the border. (Reuters, 6th)

### British Wartime Cabinet Reshuffle: Stanley Succeeds as Secretary of War; Dunglass as President of the Board of Trade; Reith as Minister of Information; Minor Positions Slightly Slower, More Changes Possible

London: Number 10 Downing Street officially announced this morning that Secretary of War Hore-Belisha and Minister of Information Macmillan have resigned. The King has approved the following new appointments: 1. Stanley as Secretary of War; 2. Dunglass as President of the Board of Trade; 3. Reith as Minister of Information.

Hore-Belisha wrote to Prime Minister Chamberlain, saying, "I am very sorry that I was unable to accept a certain important position in the cabinet reshuffle. However, I am willing to continue to support the firm operation to the best of my ability until victory is achieved. I am pleased that my views are the same as the Prime Minister's and there is no difference between us." Chamberlain replied, saying, "I am very sorry that the government reshuffle intends to entrust you with an important position, but you have not accepted it. We are always in agreement on our political views, and we agree that it is necessary to carry out the war with great determination to achieve victory. I am very pleased." The reply also praised Hore-Belisha's measures and important reforms during his tenure as Secretary of War.

Macmillan wrote to the Prime Minister, saying that he had difficulty handling affairs because he did not have a seat in the House of Commons. Therefore, he asked to resign to make way for the able and promote the efficiency of the department. The Prime Minister also replied to express his gratitude.

New cabinet members Dunglass and Reith are not members of parliament, but it is expected that they will soon obtain seats in the House of Commons. It is heard that the Prime Minister originally intended to ask Hore-Belisha to serve as President of the Board of Trade, but Hore-Belisha did not accept it. After this change, the redistribution of important positions in the government has now been completed, but minor positions may be slightly slower or there may be more changes. Stanley will succeed Hore-Belisha and join the War Cabinet, but the President of the Board of Trade and the Minister of Information are not in the War Cabinet. Stanley is currently suffering from the flu and has not been able to report to the department yet. (Reuters, 6th)

London: According to Reuters' parliamentary correspondent, the reason for Secretary of War Hore-Belisha's resignation is of course still widely speculated, but those in charge are unwilling to draw hasty conclusions and will wait for the overall situation to become clearer before expressing their opinions. As for the various suggestions published in the newspapers this morning, it should be known that all senior personnel in the War Office now have heavy responsibilities, so they have no time to comment on these suggestions. Prime Minister Chamberlain is scheduled to deliver a speech at the Lord Mayor of London's residence on Tuesday, in which he will mention the resignation of the Secretary of War, but it is questionable whether he will postpone it until Parliament reconvenes on January 16. At that time, Hore-Belisha himself will make a statement in the House of Commons, which is also uncertain, because Mr. Bei has clearly stated that he has no differences with the Prime Minister on policy. It should be noted that Mr. Bei's letter to the Prime Minister clearly expresses that there is no problem with working hard to carry out the war to achieve the goal of victory. (Reuters, 6th)

### Former Secretary of War Hore-Belisha Resolutely Retires: The Army's Innovation Plan Did Not Come True; Declares He Is Still Willing to Serve the Country

London: Regarding the resignation of Secretary of War Hore-Belisha, well-informed sources here recently declared that Prime Minister Chamberlain's cabinet reshuffle is the most important thing. Since Hore-Belisha took office as Secretary of War, he has implemented a policy of "civilizing" the British Army. His position in the British Empire's military affairs has become increasingly important. However, conservatives believe that the organization and needs of the British Army are different from those of other countries. Mr. Bei's innovation plan is only enough to strengthen the military's appearance and not enough to increase its strength, so resistance is very strong. In fact, Mr. Bei's policies, even in peacetime, are not without criticism, but the British Army is expanding greatly, and considering the situation after the outbreak of the war, there is nothing wrong with it. Moreover, the extent to which he personally can influence these policies is also exaggerated. Therefore, putting aside various technical issues, Mr. Bei's departure will inevitably cause regret in public opinion and in Parliament. His successor, President of the Board of Trade Stanley, is not as strong in color or prestige as Mr. Bei. Military experts in the War Office will be able to fully manipulate the situation in the future. Prime Minister Chamberlain also believes that military affairs should be the focus during wartime and politics should be the decision. The main reason for this decision to change the Secretary of War is probably here. However, it can be said that the combat goals and other general policies will not be changed as a result. (Havas, 6th)

London: At the beginning of his tenure as Secretary of War, Hore-Belisha's various reforms within the department and the employment of young and strong new people had already caused dissatisfaction among conservative military leaders before the war. Therefore, Mr. Bei had many enemies in the political world. At the end of 1939, someone had already incited him to resign, but it was unsuccessful. The greatest achievement of Mr. Bei during this period was the transportation of the British army to France without any damage. Mr. Bei insisted that the British Royal Air Force currently fighting in France should be under the command of the War Office instead of being directly commanded by the Aviation Department. This is probably the main reason for this decision to resign. The appointment of Stanley as Secretary of War has been met with surprise by all parties. It is believed that the General Staff Headquarters will take over the power in the future. Mr. Shi was proposed by the military personnel of the Army, so it is certain that he will cooperate with the Commander-in-Chief without a doubt. (Associated Press, 6th)

London: The new Secretary of War, Stanley, is currently suffering from a cold and was unable to take office today. Former Secretary of War Hore-Belisha issued a statement to the voters of Devonport this morning, saying, "After I was elected as a member of the House of Commons by you sixteen years ago, I have devoted myself to national affairs without interruption. You have always been my backing, and I am very grateful for your support. I have served in four departments and have always worked diligently. After taking office as Secretary of War, I know that I am duty-bound, so I thoroughly reorganized the Army and made various necessary reforms and expansions. I am honored to say that it has benefited the military's appearance and morale. In the future, no matter how difficult it is, I will always work hard and do my best. At this moment, there is no other thought but to win the war. I believe that this is understood by the people of the country. In short, since I am still a member of Devonport, I still have the opportunity to serve the country." (Havas, 6th)

Brief Biographies of the Newly Appointed Cabinet Members

Hore-Belisha was President of the Board of Trade in 1931, Minister of Finance in the same year, Minister of Transport in 1934, and transferred to Secretary of War in 1937. He had war merits in the last European War and was awarded the rank of Major. After serving as Secretary of War, he made many reforms, and the strength of the British Army was able to cope with the war situation, which was indeed due to his efforts.

Stanley was also a veteran in the last European War, serving as a major in the artillery and being wounded several times. In 1924, he served as the private secretary of the Minister of Education. In 1931, he served as an internal affairs official. Two years later, he was promoted to Minister of Transport. In 1935, he served as Minister of Labor. In 1937, he served as President of the Board of Trade. He is currently 44 years old and is one of the most promising cabinet members. It is not impossible for him to serve as Prime Minister in the future.

The new President of the Board of Trade, Dunglass, is a director of the Bank of England and a member of the Economic Advisory Council, and also serves as the chairman of the British Iron and Steel Federation. He has served in the industry, serving as the vice chairman of the Shipbuilding Employers' Federation, the chairman of the Coal Mines Bureau Advisory Committee, and the chairman of the British Sea Fisheries Commission. He entered the political world at the beginning of this year.

The new Minister of Information, Reith, is the chairman of Imperial Airways. He participated in the last European War and was wounded. In 1916, he led a delegation of key personnel to the United States to purchase military supplies. From 1922, he was the director-general of the British Broadcasting Corporation. (Reuters, 6th)

### Public Opinion Resentful of Change of Secretary of War

London: The British newspapers have unanimously expressed dissatisfaction with the departure of Secretary of War Hore-Belisha and the succession of Stanley. According to the Dundee Courier, "If the departure of Hore-Belisha is shocking, then the succession of Stanley is incomprehensible. Stanley served as the Minister of Trade, not only without any achievements, but the national industrial sector has no praise for him." The Times also believes that Hore-Belisha's achievements cannot be erased. The Daily Mail believes that the reason for Hore-Belisha's departure is the opposition from the military. The Daily Express is extremely resentful of Stanley's appointment as Secretary of War, believing that Stanley "is a member of the aristocracy, and it is not difficult to obtain high positions. Since he entered politics, he has been mediocre and has not shown anything. Now he is appointed as Secretary of War with heavy responsibility, which will inevitably disappoint people greatly." The Stockport Express stated, "The departure of Hore-Belisha is a loss to the British government." The Manchester Guardian and other newspapers stated, "Hore-Belisha removed the long-standing malpractices of the military and could not avoid being resented by others. His movement to reform the army organization and make it civilianized was also envied by other Secretaries of War." (Associated Press, 4th)

London: After Secretary of War Hore-Belisha resigned, various sectors expressed their sympathy by letters and telegrams. Hore-Belisha went to the War Office this morning to say goodbye to his subordinates. (Havas, 6th)

London: According to reliable sources, Prime Minister Chamberlain had automatically asked former Secretary of War Hore-Belisha to take the position of President of the Board of Trade before he resigned. At that time, no one knew about this except Finance Minister Simon, but Hore-Belisha finally declined. According to diplomatic sources, regarding the resignation of Secretary of War Hore-Belisha, some members of Parliament will demand that the government authorities provide an explanation when Parliament reconvenes on the 16th of this month. However, at this moment, no one will lightly blame the government, so as to increase the responsibilities of the military government. (Havas, 6th)

### Italian-Hungarian Talks Begin: Jointly Maintain Peace in Central Europe; Both Parties Agree Completely

Venice: Italian Foreign Minister Ciano and Hungarian Foreign Minister Csáky held their first talks this morning, which lasted for an hour and a half, and were scheduled to meet again in the evening. According to Foreign Minister Ciano's remarks to the press, "The talks this morning went very earnestly, and the close relationship between the two countries has been confirmed. The two sides also completely agree on the issue of maintaining the European order and peace." (Havas, 6th)

The Topics of the Talks Include Four Items

Rome: According to a semi-official Hungarian communiqué from Rome Radio, the talks between Italian Foreign Minister Ciano and Hungarian Foreign Minister Csáky in Venice today will discuss four main issues: (1) The consequences of Hungary and the Soviet Union establishing a common border; (2) The relationship between Hungary and Romania. Although it has not improved, both countries regard communism as a common enemy. This may promote the two countries to get closer; (3) The relationship between Hungary and Yugoslavia; (4) The common attitude of Italy and Hungary towards the European War. (Reuters, 6th)

Milan: According to the "Sera Newspaper," Hungarian Foreign Minister Csáky will extensively exchange various opinions with Italian Foreign Minister Ciano, for three reasons: (1) Italy is the only major European power that has not been involved in the war; (2) Rome continues to work hard to prevent other European countries, especially the Balkan countries, from being involved in the war; (3) Italy is determined to protect its interests everywhere. Therefore, maintaining peace in the Balkans will be the most important topic in the Venice talks. (Haitong, 6th)

Italy Seeks to Promote Hungarian-Yugoslav Relations

Rome: Hungarian Foreign Minister Csáky arrived in Venice this morning, and Italian Foreign Minister Ciano also went to the port this evening and is scheduled to meet and talk tomorrow. Political figures here are paying close attention to this matter. It is heard that when the foreign ministers of Hungary and Italy meet, they will discuss the new situation created by the joint invasion of Poland by Germany and the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union's ambitions for Southeastern Europe, and other issues related to the two countries. Diplomatic figures say that Italy's Central European policy is to maintain the status quo. For the sake of maintaining the interests of the Balkan Peninsula and the Danube River Basin, Italy naturally prioritizes maintaining peace in this corner. As for the current relationship between Italy and Hungary, it is extremely friendly and can decide on a common attitude to deal with all events. In addition, Italy urgently hopes that Hungary can adjust its relations with Romania and Yugoslavia. This issue will naturally be discussed in the talks. (Havas, 5th)

### American Ship Forced into War Zone, US Issues Warning to Britain, Britain to Bear Responsibility for Damages

Washington - The US government has warned Britain that if American ships are forced to enter British inspection ports, resulting in loss or damage, Britain will be held responsible for compensation. The State Department today published a lengthy document from the US to the British government, conveyed through the British Ambassador to the US, Lord Lothian, regarding this matter. The State Department announced that the American ship "Mormarkson," en route to Bergen, was forced into Kirkwall, one of the British inspection ports, an area where American neutrality laws prohibit entry. Forcing American ships into war zones is a violation of American neutrality laws. Therefore, the State Department has instructed the US Ambassador to Britain to immediately contact the captain of the "Mormarkson" to obtain a detailed report of the incident and prepare for possible action. The State Department's dispatch, dated December 14th and signed by Secretary of State Hull, stated that since American shipping companies are willing to cooperate with British authorities, the State Department anticipates that American ships will not need to enter the ports of belligerent nations. If the British authorities do not consider this and find it necessary to force American ships into war zones or any port of a belligerent nation that American neutrality laws prohibit entry into, the US government will find it necessary to carefully study all the facts and take actions deemed necessary or expedient after such study. The US government, in addition to reserving all rights in such events, expects that losses and damages arising from the violation of these rights will, of course, be compensated. Given the magnanimous spirit of American shipping, it is hoped that the British government will provide a corresponding degree of convenience and accommodation. It is noted that the British government issued a note to the US on November 9th, stating that although the US has declared a war zone, Britain reserves the right to order American ships to enter inspection ports. This dispatch from the US is, in effect, a response to that. State Department personnel stated today that the term "losses and damages" includes losses incurred by American ships due to delays caused by being diverted to British ports. (Reuters dispatch, 5th)

### Belligerent Nations Laying Mines in International Waters, Argentina Issues Protest, Demands Reservation of Right to Claim Compensation

### President Roosevelt Meets with Italian Ambassador, Related to Peace Movement

Washington - After meeting with President Roosevelt at the White House, the Italian Ambassador to the US, Mr. Calenna, told reporters that President Roosevelt expressed satisfaction with Italy's attitude towards the European war. Opinions were exchanged on the general international situation, and attention was given to relations between the US and Italy. (Haitong dispatch, 6th)

Washington - The Italian Ambassador to the US, Mr. Calenna, visited President Roosevelt at the White House yesterday, which has drawn significant attention from political circles here. It is said that this visit was initiated by Roosevelt. The content of the talks has not been officially released. American political figures believe that Italy's attitude towards the current European war was discussed, and that this meeting is part of President Roosevelt's new policy initiative. This policy was hinted at when Roosevelt and the Italian King exchanged telegrams and when a special envoy to the Vatican was appointed. They claim that President Roosevelt is still considering the possibility of launching a peace movement and is therefore first seeking to ascertain the attitudes of Italy and the Vatican towards an American peace movement through the Italian Ambassador.

### Soviet Army Adopts Long-Term Strategy Due to Strong Resistance in Finland, Continued Artillery Battles Between Two Armies in Karelian Isthmus, Soviet Aircraft Bomb Finnish Industrial Center Yesterday

Helsinki - The Soviet authorities seem hesitant about what new strategy to adopt in the face of extremely strong resistance to their recent offensive against Finland. The transfer of fresh troops from the Soviet interior has not been completed quickly due to transportation difficulties. At the same time, Soviet military leaders have now realized that Finland is difficult to conquer in the short term and have therefore adopted a long-term strategy. As a result, Soviet troops in the Karelian Isthmus are now beginning to build fortifications and barracks for long-term garrisoning. At the same time, aerial bombardment has been greatly reduced. Today, nine Soviet aircraft dropped 22 bombs on the town of Vokii (near the Kovala railway) between Helsinki and Viipuri, destroying ten houses and killing two civilians and injuring sixteen. Other places were also bombed, with unknown results. (United Press dispatch, 6th)

London - A spokesman for the Finnish Embassy in London stated that Finnish troops have penetrated 10 to 15 miles into Soviet territory in the Lappola area and have been fighting inside Soviet territory for several days. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)

Helsinki - The General Headquarters issued a battle report stating: (1) In the Karelian Isthmus, artillery fire was quite intense last night. The Red Army attacked Kivessilmä along the Zobe River but was repelled by our troops. 150 Red Army soldiers were killed. (2) On the eastern front, there was considerable activity by artillery and patrols north of Lake Ladoga. The Red Army's counterattack on the town of Itokijoki has been repelled. In the Suomussalmi district, our troops continued sweeping operations. A Red Army unit of 250 soldiers was annihilated. (3) Soviet aircraft flew to Abo, Hango Island, and various places in the north today, dropping bombs. Our losses were minimal. (Havas dispatch, 5th)

Moscow - According to a communiqué issued by the headquarters of the Leningrad Military District, there were no major developments on the front line five days ago. Reconnaissance units of both sides were active in the areas of Ukhtua, Petrozavodsk, and Repola. Soviet reconnaissance units killed 50 enemy soldiers in Petrozavodsk. There was also artillery fire and reconnaissance activity in the Karelian Isthmus. The Soviet Air Force bombed enemy storage depots and military targets with great success. (TASS dispatch, 6th)

Helsinki - The Leningrad Military District of the Soviet Union previously spread rumors that Finnish troops had begun a counteroffensive and were about to attack Leningrad, causing great panic among the residents there. Red Army patrols were stationed in the streets and alleys, and security lines were set up around various institutions. People are arrested daily for absenteeism. As for Kronstadt, which geographically serves as an outpost for the Leningrad Military District, civilians have begun to evacuate in preparation for any eventuality. In addition, the situation in Murmansk in northern Soviet Union is also extremely tense. Restrictions on travelers are even more severe than before. The railway there is entirely for military use, and passenger trains have been suspended. It is also reported that Soviet-made American-style aircraft require American fuel. Since the US morally prohibited the export of fuel to the Soviet Union, the source has been cut off. Since Soviet factories do not know the composition of this fuel and cannot manufacture it themselves, panic has arisen in the air force. Soviet aircraft have been less active recently, probably for this reason. (Havas dispatch, 5th)

Helsinki - According to reports received here, nine Soviet bombers attacked the Finnish industrial center of Voega yesterday, dropping 22 bombs, destroying ten houses, killing two civilians, and injuring sixteen. (Haitong News Agency, 6th)

Britain May Provide Loans to Aid Finland

(Haitong dispatch, 6th)

The commander's act of treason was soon exposed, and he committed suicide in fear of punishment. Several accomplices were shot. (Havas dispatch, 6th)

### Visit of the Burmese Delegation to China: China's Heroic Resistance to Japan Can Lead to Ultimate Victory and Become a Leader in the World Commonwealth Movement

Chongqing Air Dispatch: The Burmese delegation to China, led by U Ba Lwin and others, has been busy with visits and banquets since arriving in Chongqing, showering praise and gratitude, warming this winter mountain city. However, what are their concrete impressions of us? This is a question everyone needs to know. On the eve of the delegation's departure from Chongqing to Chengdu, the reporter made a farewell visit.

Two minutes after the white-clad attendant took the card upstairs, hurried and joyful footsteps echoed on the stairs. The footsteps stopped in front of the reporter, but the reporter was puzzled—the person standing in front of the reporter and shaking hands enthusiastically was no longer the Burmese friend wearing a floral silk turban and a Burmese-style jacket, but a man wearing a blue mandarin jacket and a black vest, and a woman (Ms. Daw Mya Sein) wearing a Chinese-made black velvet long cheongsam.

"What do you think? Don't you recognize me?" said U Ba Lwin, the head of the delegation, smiling, as if meeting an old friend after a long separation, shaking hands even tighter. "This was given to us by Chairman Chiang." At this moment, he, who was innocent and sincere, also seemed a little proud.

"You must be very busy, visiting here in the morning and there in the afternoon," the reporter turned the topic to the main subject.

"Yes, we are all very excited. We have only been in your country for eight or nine days, but what we have learned and experienced is at least more than in any previous eight or nine years." So everyone expressed their opinions to their heart's content.

First of all, they expressed their greatest joy and hope for China's solidarity. They said that this was due to the wise leadership of Chairman Chiang. Chairman Chiang united all the Chinese people around him, laying a solid foundation for China, and on that foundation, the whole country marched towards a bright and happy future.

Such a China, the powerful help she will be able to give to her fellow peace-loving neighbors, should be the common wish and belief of the people of both countries. The establishment of the China-Burma Cultural Association in Chongqing today is equivalent to laying a foundation for China and Burma. We must build houses well and promote and develop the ideas and culture of the two countries. They also said that the establishment of the China-Burma Cultural Association is the most valuable of their many valuable gains on this trip.

They also expressed their warm admiration for China's industry and commerce—industry and commerce that are becoming increasingly strong and powerful in the war of resistance: "Before we visited your country's shipbuilding industry, we simply couldn't imagine that all the machinery related to the war of resistance and national construction was made by your country."

As for China's education and culture—education and culture that have been wantonly destroyed by Japanese ambitions and aggression—they believe that it is enough to make people feel excited and even more to be used as a model. In particular, the Chinese press has also demonstrated its arduous and glorious mission in the war of resistance. Most of the newspaper offices in various places have been bombed by Japanese planes, but their answer is to continue to struggle in a more powerful way, without a moment of slackness, contributing their reporting duties. U Ba Lwin, who has been engaged in journalism in Burma for 20 years and has always spoken out for China's war of resistance, once again mentioned his cooperation method between the Chinese and Burmese press: frequent contact and mutual provision of information. At his request, the Joint Committee of Newspapers here wrote an open letter to the Burmese press. In addition to being willing to bring this "good news," U Ba Lwin is also willing to continue to expose Japan's false propaganda in Burma as his own responsibility.

The deputy head of the delegation, Ms. Daw Mya Sein, repeatedly expressed her admiration for the bravery of Chinese women. He said: This is indeed a very necessary fact. If women want to fight for independence, freedom, and equality, the nation must first be completely liberated, and half of the responsibility for the complete liberation of the nation lies with women, who account for half of humanity. Burmese and Chinese women should establish close ties in culture, art, and all aspects, and exchange their experiences and lessons in fighting for the independence and freedom of their motherland.

The number of overseas Chinese living in Burma exceeds 300,000, accounting for 40% of the total population of Burma. Due to their noble character and hard work, they have given the Burmese people a very good impression and influence. U Ba Lwin, the head of the delegation, told a joke to prove that this was the case: "Otherwise, why would most Burmese women be willing to marry Chinese men?"

The actions of overseas Chinese in Burma to resist Japan in the motherland were first to call on people throughout India and Burma to boycott Japanese goods, and then to establish the "China-Burma Buddhist Federation," which distributed news in both Chinese and Burmese. In addition, it also united 13 charitable organizations throughout Burma to establish a "Burma Disaster Relief Association," which specializes in donating medicine and money to China, and has remitted 6 million kyats in cash. Overseas Chinese women also established an "International Women's Association" to do various kinds of work related to the war of resistance. During the two years of the war of resistance, they held 360 "Chinese Meal" charity sales, that is, using Chinese cooking that foreigners like to eat to exchange for donations from friendly countries, and remitted them to China to resist Japan, which was very impressive.

In short, under the circumstances that China has been fighting for independence and freedom for three years and has already obtained the foundation for victory, the Burmese people have already given a ruthless response to all the political, economic, cultural, and even transportation conspiracies of the Japanese warlords in Burma, and of course, they will not have the slightest politeness or concession in the future. The ultimate goal of China's heroic resistance to Japan is to lay the cornerstone of world peace. Therefore, China's resolute and heroic resistance to Japan can not only achieve victory, not only establish a great and glorious strong country, but also become a leader in the world commonwealth movement.

The lights in the living room seemed particularly bright at this moment, exchanging brilliance with the faces of the excited people. However, it was getting late, and when we said goodbye reluctantly, U Ba Lwin also wrote a few words in Burmese for a colleague to use as the end:

"If a pair of flying crows are still not happy in a golden cage, then how can a country be happy under the rule of another country?"

### Japanese Soldiers Harass Zhumen Area of Nantian County Again

Nantian Dispatch: On the 19th of last month, a Japanese warship appeared off the coast of Hua'ao in this county and sent out a speedboat to attempt to land at Jin Gao Yi in this county, but was repelled by the Chinese army's self-defense force. Unexpectedly, the next morning, the Japanese warship continued to send out three small speedboats carrying more than 40 soldiers to spy on Jin Gao Yi again. The self-defense force, upon receiving the report, immediately divided up to meet the enemy. After a fierce battle for three hours, the Japanese soldiers failed. The Japanese warship then sailed into the inner harbor and fired more than ten shells, bombarding fiercely. Another 80 Japanese soldiers were secretly landed at Zhudou and other places, and they broke into Longquan Town to search house by house. At 3 pm, reinforcements from the self-defense force arrived and launched a brave counterattack. After a fierce battle for more than an hour, the Japanese soldiers fled back to the original warship in a panic. In this battle, three Chinese soldiers were killed or wounded, and two were missing. More than ten Japanese soldiers were killed or wounded, and their bodies were dragged back to the original warship. They raised anchor and sailed away.

What is particularly surprising is the case of the attempted attack on Mr. Phillips by thugs yesterday. Mr. Phillips usually abides by the law and has a gentle attitude. All parties have a good impression of him. It is really unclear why the thugs did this. The details are recorded as follows:

Narrow Escape in the Early Morning

At about 9:15 yesterday morning, Mr. Phillips was driven out by the chauffeur Wu Jin-gen in his own car No. 4160. At that time, two rickshaw pullers were wandering in front of No. 493. When they saw Mr. Phillips' car driving out, the two rickshaw pullers rushed out of the Zhujia Ku Lane across from the Bai Sai Zhong Road, pulling their rickshaws and pretending to run across the road when the car drove in front of them, and immediately shouted. Unexpectedly, the rickshaw pullers still ran forward, one of them stopped in front of Mr. Phillips' car and blocked the car body, and the other drove to the left side of the car. The vehicles they were pulling collided with Mr. Phillips' car, and the disguised rickshaw puller took advantage of the unpreparedness of Mr. Phillips' chauffeur and suddenly drew a pistol and fired a shot at Mr. Phillips. Mr. Phillips suddenly heard the gunshot and quickly dodged. Then the thug fired three shots in a row. Finally, because the thug's aiming skills were poor, although there were four bullets in total, Mr. Phillips was fortunately not injured.

The Murderer Removed his Disguise and Fled in Panic

After the thug fired four shots in a row, the chauffeur Wu Jin-gen of Mr. Phillips' car was safe and sound, and he had already turned the car out of the state of being surrounded by two rickshaws and drove forward quickly. Therefore, although Mr. Phillips' car was hit by bullets, Mr. Phillips and his chauffeur were unharmed. After the murderer saw the chauffeur driving away at full speed, there were more than ten gunshots, as dense as a string of beads. Then he ran into Zhujia Ku Lane, fled into a nearby thatched house, and removed his rickshaw puller's clothing in a panic. According to another source, the murderer was captured by Zhang, a bodyguard of the Xinxin Entertainment Ground nearby, and taken to the special service agency there. However, after investigations by all parties, the agency has always kept silent about this matter, so it has not been possible to obtain proof of where the detained thug is currently.

Eight Bullet Holes in Mr. Phillips' Car

After this incomprehensible and shocking major case occurred, Mr. Phillips escaped danger and went to the bureau to handle official business as usual. Immediately, Mr. Phillips and the detective of the police station went to the scene of the incident to investigate and found nine bullet casings. As for Mr. Phillips' car, it was found to have as many as eight bullet holes. It is heard that the concession permits installed on the two rickshaws were forged, which proves that the thugs had a conspiracy about this matter long ago. The police stations of the Public Concession and the French Concession attach great importance to this case and are working hard to investigate it, and clues should be obtained soon.

The Thugs' Target Remains to be Determined

It is reported that before the thugs attacked Mr. Phillips, they had been wandering around Mr. Phillips' residence at around 4 am on the 6th. Although there were only two thugs who fired the pistol yesterday morning, there were as many as six or seven people watching the wind nearby at the same time. Before firing the gun, the thugs looked at Mr. Phillips, so it can be known that their target of attack was a Westerner. However, although they looked at Mr. Phillips, it has not been determined whether their target of attack was Mr. Phillips. It is not known whether the thugs had actually identified Mr. Phillips himself before firing the gun and then attacked him.

Chinese and Foreign People Expressed Their Condolences

After the news of Mr. Phillips' sudden attack by thugs spread, Chinese and foreign leaders went to the Public Works Department to express their condolences one after another. Although Mr. Phillips was frightened, he still handled matters as usual and his attitude was very calm. Mrs. Phillips learned of her husband's escape at her residence until noon and expressed her joy to the visiting guests and thanked her friends for their enthusiasm and concern in visiting her. It is reported that Mr. Phillips does not know of any grievances. It is impossible to speculate on the motive for someone attacking him this time. According to Mr. Phillips' statement to the Associated Press reporter, he believes that he has no enemies, so he has no precautions against this matter.

Reports in Western Newspapers that the Thugs Were Arrested

The English-language Da Mei Evening Post reported that Mr. Phillips, the Director-General and CEO of the Public Works Department, was suddenly attacked by three thugs disguised as rickshaw pullers who fired no fewer than eight shots at him when he took a car from his residence at No. 633 Haige Road to the bureau this morning (the 6th). However, the chauffeur was very alert. Upon hearing two gunshots, he drove away at full speed, so Mr. Phillips and the chauffeur were not injured. It was later learned that the three thugs had been arrested in a lane on Haige Road after committing the crime. The Public Concession Police Department is trying to detain the three thugs. However, as of the afternoon, it is still a mystery where the arrested thugs are. Major General Simmons, the commander of the British army stationed in Shanghai, has protested to the Japanese military police authorities about the attempted assassination of British personnel in the British army defense zone. The process of this case is as follows: Mr. Phillips had just left his residence on Haige Road at 9:15 this morning when three thugs disguised as rickshaw pullers rushed out of the Zhujia Ku Lane across from the Bai Sai Zhong Road. The first thug tried to pull the rickshaw to the middle of the road to block the car's way. The second thug then fired a gun. When the chauffeur drove away at full speed, the two fired several more shots, and then ran into Zhujia Ku Lane, firing two more shots as a show of force, and fled into a nearby thatched house to change out of their rickshaw puller's clothing. The armed bodyguards of the nearby Xinxin Gambling Ground heard the gunshots and entered the thatched house to arrest them. After investigation by the police department, it was found that there were a total of six members of the gang. When the three thugs who participated in the shooting obtained the rickshaws, they sent the original rickshaw pullers to teahouses to drink tea. The three thugs set off to attack, and the other three guarded the side. According to previous reports that British Ambassador Sir Kerr had heard that someone was plotting to assassinate him, he asked the police department to provide special protection. The ambassador himself also wore a steel wire vest and had two policemen as bodyguards, accompanying the ambassador everywhere. He then obtained a bulletproof car equipped with thick glass and other equipment to ensure safety.

Mr. Phillips, Director-General of the Public Works Department

### More Than 500 Japanese Troops Marched in Hongkou Yesterday Morning, Rumored to Be Newly Transferred to China, Will Hold a Review Ceremony This Morning

Yesterday morning at around 7 o'clock, more than 500 Japanese naval and army troops, fully armed, gathered in a military camp in the eastern area of Shanghai, and set off for a march, turning into Huade Road via Yangshupu Road, following Broadway Road and turning into North Sichuan Road, directly to the Japanese military headquarters on Jiangwan Road before dispersing and returning to their headquarters. When the Japanese troops passed by, the traffic arteries and intersections were heavily guarded, and vehicles and pedestrians were prohibited from advancing. The troops participating in the march were led by a patrol of machine gun cars, followed by soldiers, and at the end were armored military vehicles and tanks. However, according to eyewitnesses, the team was quite disorganized, perhaps newly transferred from Japan to China. It is also reported that the Japanese naval and army and police units stationed in Shanghai will hold a review in Hongkou Park this morning.

### Shame and Honor Movement Encourages Shanghai Citizens to Value the Nation and Ethnicity, Hone Their Ambitions and Pledge to Be a Backing Force

The Shame and Honor Movement Committee of all circles in this city believes that the great victory of the Chinese army in northern Guangdong is enough to prove the national policy of sure victory in the war of resistance and sure success in national construction. Moreover, it can be firmly believed without any doubt. In addition to congratulating the supreme commander and the front-line soldiers, it also wrote to the citizens of Shanghai, encouraging everyone to value the nation and ethnicity and to be the backing force of the government. The article said: Since last year

(Great Victory in Northern Hunan) since then, there have been frequent reports of victories in the provinces of Jin, Yu, E, Wan, and Gan. We deeply believe that two and a half years of resistance have made the Japanese sink deeper and deeper into the quagmire, and will eventually be unable to extricate themselves. Now that the new curtain of the 29th year has been unveiled, the southern section of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway

(Another Great Victory) in this battle, tens of thousands of Japanese soldiers were killed or wounded, more than 100 armored vehicles were destroyed, and steel helmets, guns, ammunition, and other military supplies were captured, piled up like mountains. The Japanese army's rout was even worse than the defeat in northern Hunan. The Japanese army spent months preparing

(To Show off Their Elite Troops) originally intending to regain in Guangdong what they lost in Hunan, but unexpectedly their collapse was so violent, which shows that they have been exhausted again and again. Our army is getting stronger and stronger as it fights. Facts prove that this year can be transformed from the stalemate stage of the war of resistance to the decisive stage of final victory. Moreover, it can be firmly believed without any doubt. However, the closer victory

(Closer and Closer) the hardships we will encounter will inevitably be doubled compared to the past. Only by sacrificing everything and overcoming the greatest difficulties can we reach the realm of brightness and happiness. All our compatriots must value the nation and ethnicity, hone their ambitions,

(Promote Shame and Honor) abide by their posts, firmly believe, pledge to be the backing force of the government, not be intimidated by power, not be tempted by profit, and continue to work hard to eliminate the masses, so as to achieve the goal of final victory.

### British Gunboat Scorpion Departs Shanghai

The Zi Lin Daily reported that the British gunboat Scorpion, which served as the flagship of Lieutenant General Holt, commander of the British Navy in the Yangtze River in 1937, has recently left Shanghai. According to the British government's policy of reducing the number of ships stationed in the Yangtze River in order to transfer officers and soldiers to serve elsewhere for military needs, most of the gunboats in the Yangtze River Fleet have been withdrawn.

### Dredging Work, Date of Resumption, Expected to Officially Resume Next Month

According to the Datong News Agency reporter, since the Dredging Bureau was forced to reorganize, the original dredgers of the bureau have been detained by the Japanese. Except for some such as the Construction, which were returned last month, another part was returned yesterday, and there are also several survey vessels. However, all the above-mentioned ships need to be repaired, so it is difficult to start using them immediately.

Dredging Work to Resume Next Month

The survey department of the bureau is preparing to rush to survey the channel of the Huangpu River within this month, and plans to first survey the areas with the most severe siltation. At that time, the dredgers being repaired in the dock can be repaired and leave the dock. It is expected that dredging work can be officially resumed from the 1st of next month to facilitate navigation.

Notice of High Tide in the Huangpu River

According to the hydrology department of the bureau, the amount of high tide will be above 10 feet from the 8th to the 11th of this month, and the tide time will be in the afternoon, so the water flow will be particularly turbulent, reaching 3.2 nautical miles per hour. Attention should be paid to the sailing of sails.

### Shanghai Goods Transported to Wenzhou Must Submit Commercial Certificates for Inspection, Otherwise They Must Be Investigated

After the successful trial voyage of the Shanghai-Wenzhou route by foreign shipping companies, the freight volume has gradually increased. The Oujiang Import and Export Goods Inspection Office, in order to check whether merchants purchase imported goods, in addition to those that can be imported in accordance with Article 3 of the Zhejiang Provincial Provisional Restriction on the Import and Export of Blockaded Shipping Goods, all others should apply for registration in accordance with the procedures stipulated in Article 5 of the Registration Inspection Measures and transfer them to the provincial government for approval before they can be imported. However, since Shanghai fell, the original state-run factories have been seized or controlled by the Japanese, making it difficult to distinguish between domestic goods and non-domestic goods, and it is easy to cause misunderstandings. In order to facilitate inspection, it has recently been stipulated that in the future, merchants who purchase imported domestic or foreign goods, whether or not they have been approved by the provincial government, must obtain certificates from the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce and submit them together with the red declaration form for inspection and release. Otherwise, they must be approved after investigation. The Yongjia County Chamber of Commerce has been ordered to instruct merchants in various industries to strictly abide by this.

### The Bond Market is Thriving, Credit is Becoming More Solid, 80% of Customs Duties Were Intercepted Last Year, Relying on the National Government to Maintain Creditworthiness Unaffected

The brokerage firms and securities firms affiliated to the Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange were originally operating normally in the gray market of public bonds. Since the unprecedented victory in northern Hunan, the bond market has been thriving. Now that the entire line in northern Guangdong has been won, the prices of the unified public bonds issued by the country have also soared. People from all walks of life, with the frequent news of the victory in the war of resistance, are willing to buy and sell a large number of national public bonds. In order to facilitate customers' contact, securities firms have started to specialize in the business of unified public bonds, and the situation is extremely enthusiastic, showing that the future of our war of resistance has shown brightness.

According to statistics, in the past three days, the prices of unified bonds of various types have risen by two or three yuan, which is also due to the solid creditworthiness of the bonds. As for the Japanese interception of various customs duties guaranteeing national bonds, although the amount is huge, fortunately the national government has been prepared and has not been affected in the slightest.

A Huge Amount of Customs Duties Was Intercepted

Since the customs offices in the war zone fell, the tax revenue has been intercepted by the Japanese and has never been remitted to the General Taxation Department, Mr. Meierhe. According to last year's calculations, the taxes intercepted from the Jianghai Customs, the Donghai Customs, etc., amounted to more than 273.93 million yuan in national currency. The tax revenues have been intercepted by the Yokohama Specie Bank, a Japanese bank, and the original tax collectors of the Central Bank in the customs offices have been forced to withdraw. The national tax revenue last year was 331.32 million yuan, and the amount intercepted accounted for 80% of the total.

All Funds Forcibly Deposited in Japanese Banks

The government has always fulfilled its debt obligations on schedule, especially the various customs-guaranteed loans, which have never been delayed. Since the tax revenue of the customs offices in the war zone has been seized by the Japanese and all funds have been forcibly deposited in Japanese banks, the funds to be allocated to each customs office have never been remitted as scheduled. Therefore, a notice was issued in January last year on the measures for customs duty debt repayment, and the domestic debts guaranteed by customs surplus, (1) the 25th-year Unified Public Bonds, (2) the 25th-year Recovery Public Bonds, and (3) the 17th-year Gold Long Public Bonds, the principal and interest due last year were completely suspended and transferred to the National Debt Fund Management Committee for preparation.

Four Banks Discount to Maintain Creditworthiness

In order to maintain the creditworthiness of domestic debts, the four banks, including the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Agricultural Bank of China, allow discounting and payment of the principal and interest due on the three types of domestic debts guaranteed by customs surplus: Unified, Recovery, and Gold Long. The eighth principal and interest payment of the five types of unified public bonds A, B, C, D, and E have been scheduled to be discounted and paid from January 31. The eighth principal repayment of the Recovery Public Bonds will be held on the 10th of this month, and the discounting and payment will be made from February 29. The 23rd principal repayment of the Financial Long-Term Public Bonds will be held on the 10th of March, and the discounting and payment will be made from March 31. Detailed measures will be announced by the Ministry at that time.

### Local Russians Celebrate Festivals

The Shanghai Times reported that Shanghai Russians will celebrate Christmas Eve tonight (the 6th) and Christmas on the 7th, according to the old Russian calendar, and New Year's Day on January 14. Russians are very lively every time these festivals come, no less than other foreigners. Russian churches in Shanghai will hold special services tomorrow (the 7th).

### Internal Decision on Fair Price Rice Measures Date: From the 10th day of the 12th lunar month Location: 50 locations to be set up in the two concessions

After the establishment of the Shanghai Fair Price Rice Committee, it has been actively soliciting fair price rice funds from various industries, expanding its organization, and hiring enthusiastic individuals as committee members. Simultaneously, it has purchased 16,000 bags of Saigon broken rice from the market and telegraphed Saigon to order 15,000 bags of foreign rice. It has internally decided to commence fair price rice distribution starting from February 18th (i.e., the 10th day of the 12th lunar month), with a total of 50 fair price rice distribution points, including 30 in the International Settlement and 20 in the French Concession, entrusted to the Shanghai Rice Merchants Association for management.

Rice Merchants Association Discusses Measures

After deciding to entrust the Rice Merchants Association with the management of fair price rice distribution, the association held a temporary joint meeting of directors and supervisors at its office on Shanhai Pass Road at 3:00 PM yesterday. Attendees included Lu Wen Shao, Qu Zhen Hua, Shi Hong Dong, Pan Ji Bin, Chen Shao Lian, Zhang He Ming, and others. Zhang Nian Xuan, the chairman, reported the purpose of the meeting. Subsequently, the matter of managing fair price rice distribution was discussed. All committee members expressed their support in principle for the distribution, considering it related to the relief of the common people. Zhang Nian Xuan and Lu Wen Shao were appointed to liaise with the Fair Price Rice Committee on specific measures, and the meeting adjourned at 4:30 PM.

Fair Price Rice Committee to Meet Today

The Fair Price Rice Committee has scheduled a committee meeting for 1:00 PM today at the Shipping Club on Guangdong Road. It will elect 11 standing committee members and issue a declaration detailing the purpose of fair price rice distribution, hoping that various industries will actively donate to ensure the sustained operation of fair price rice distribution. In addition, specific measures for fair price rice distribution will be discussed. Committee members Chu Qia Qing, Chen Zi Shen, Wang Yu Qing, and Zhang Nian Xuan, among others, held an informal discussion at the Shipping Club at 4:00 PM yesterday, deciding to actively solicit fair price rice funds from various industries. It is reported that various commercial organizations have mobilized to solicit donations from their members.

People's Food Association Purchases Rice in Bulk

Yesterday, a reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned from relevant sources that regarding the regulation of food supply for Shanghai residents, (1) rice will be ordered in bulk by the People's Food Association, and (2) fair price rice distribution will be managed by the Fair Price Rice Committee. The progress of fair price rice distribution has been described above. Regarding bulk rice purchases, the People's Food Association has already registered rice orders. Numerous organizations, agencies, companies, firms, and factories are applying to order. The first batch of 600 tons has been telegraphed to Saigon for ordering and will arrive in Shanghai before the end of this month. The second batch will soon be telegraphed to Saigon for ordering. Banks and financial institutions have agreed to provide advances for bulk rice purchases.

Market Rice Prices Have Trended Stable

Since the People's Food Regulation Association and the Fair Price Rice Committee ordered foreign rice in bulk and raised funds for fair price rice distribution, public confidence in Shanghai's rice supply has stabilized. The rush to buy rice has disappeared. Rice prices in the bean, rice, and tea markets have trended stable. At the same time, the authorities of the two concessions have shown great determination to maintain the food supply and suppress speculation. As a result, the general public dares not manipulate or hoard rice. In addition, foreign rice is steadily arriving in Shanghai. In addition to the rice that has already arrived, there are still 80,000 bags that will arrive before January 15th. In recent days, due to the easing of foreign exchange rates, many have continued to order foreign rice. Therefore, there is no need to worry about Shanghai residents' food supply in the future.

### Jianghai Customs Patrol Ships Reiterate Demands for Return

After the Japanese released the Jianghai Customs patrol ship "Lianxing," more than ten other patrol ships, ranging from the cruiser flagship "Fuxing" downwards, were still requisitioned by the Japanese, and their whereabouts remain unclear. It is now learned that the Jianghai Customs Commissioner, Robert Bredon, has once again raised the issue of returning the ships with the Japanese in order to strengthen the force for suppressing smuggling. However, according to general observation, it is difficult to achieve a positive outcome.

### Two-Cent Auxiliary Currency Notes Found to Be Counterfeit

Recently, counterfeit two-cent auxiliary currency notes of the Central Bank have suddenly appeared on the market, deceiving the public and causing considerable losses. These counterfeit two-cent notes are of very poor paper quality, with blurred lines and a darker color. With a little attention, it is possible to distinguish the genuine from the fake. Fortunately, citizens are paying attention.

### Japanese Steel Panic Scouring for Iron Materials in China Iron Stored at Jiangnan Shipyard All Seized Commercial Iron Factory Machinery Also Looted

After two and a half years of intense fighting between China and Japan, the Japanese side's domestic steel has been almost completely depleted. Therefore, they are actively scouring for metals such as copper, iron, and steel in the occupied areas of China, sparing no effort. Recently, they have further established a so-called "Iron Manufacturing Joint Stock Company," specializing in the purchase of iron parts and machinery, using ruffians and other unsavory characters to carry out their activities everywhere. This shows that the Japanese steel panic has reached an extreme point. The details are as follows:

Iron Stored at Jiangnan All Seized

The state-run Jiangnan Shipyard in Gaochangmiao had a large quantity of iron parts stored during the war. Due to their bulkiness, they could not be moved out in time, and they fell into the hands of the Japanese. Initially, the factory was renamed Mitsubishi Shipyard, and it began repairing damaged Japanese ships. Later, due to the excessive amount of ammunition consumed by the Japanese army at the front line, domestic iron materials became increasingly scarce. As a result, the iron stored in the Jiangnan Shipyard was completely removed, including some iron parts that were hidden at the foot of Dama Mountain during the war. Therefore, the Jiangnan Shipyard suffered significant damage.

Commercial Hongchang Also Suffers Greatly

Unexpectedly, the Japanese have redoubled their efforts, establishing the so-called "Iron Manufacturing Joint Stock Company" last year, extensively collecting iron parts, and further coveting the iron parts in iron factories established by purely merchants in an attempt to make up for their iron shortage. According to investigations, a large number of machines and iron materials in the Hongchang Iron Factory, a commercial enterprise in the Nanshi area, were also collected by the "Iron Manufacturing Joint Stock Company." Subsequently, the factory discovered this and, through various means, reported it to the puppet authorities for investigation. The result was that only three ruffians, Hu Fu Hai, Wang Xing An, and Tang Jiao Zhou, were blamed, claiming that they had stolen and sold all the machines and iron materials of the factory to the "Iron Manufacturing Company," obtaining 3,600 yuan and escaping, making it impossible to pursue the matter.

Iron Storage Yard Also Established in Wusong

The iron materials obtained by the Japanese from various places in Jiangnan were originally piled up on wasteland next to the puppet "Fish Market" on Qiwupu Road in Yangshupu. Now, because that place is too conspicuous, it is inconvenient. Another piece of wasteland has been opened up at the northern end of Wenzaobang in Chengshong to store iron materials. Transport ships are then modified and moored in the Wusong River, and the iron parts are gradually transported back to their country for use. Therefore, in recent months, Japanese transport ships have no longer been seen loading iron materials in the Yangshupu area, and this is the reason.

### Kidnapping of the Owner of the Huacheng Printing House Arrest of the Chauffeur The Kidnapping Car Belongs to a Japanese Car Dealership The Driver, Jin Xing Cai, Arrested While Obtaining His License

Mao Shu Jun, the owner of the Huacheng Printing House at 1228 Avenue Foch, was suddenly approached at 9:50 AM on December 29th of last year by three foreigners and one Chinese person in a patrol car numbered 18143. They accused Mao of printing anti-Japanese books, forced him into the car, and sped away. After the Jing'an Temple Police Station learned of the incident, Chief Detective Ni Jia Feng and Detective Weeks arrested Jin Xing Cai (resident of No. 14 Yuxiang Lane, Rue Albert), the driver at the time. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District and requested for detention.

### Impersonating Police Officers Defrauding People of Money One Culprit Arrested on the Spot

Yuan Cheng Cloth Shop at No. 50 Longquan Garden Lane, established by Yu Shi Xun, was visited at 10:30 AM the day before yesterday by a Westerner and a Chinese man, claiming to be police officers. They claimed to have received a tip that Yu was selling drugs and had come to search. Yu, seeing that the Westerner was wearing what appeared to be a police uniform, did not suspect anything. The five men searched everywhere but could not find any drugs. However, they claimed that even if they could not find drugs, they could still arrest him unless he paid 500 yuan. At this point, Yu realized that these people were not police officers but imposters attempting to extort money. He secretly reported this to the Laozha Police Station. Chief Detective Yang De Chun rushed to the scene and arrested only Bao Yi Ming. The other four had already fled. Yesterday morning, Bao Yi Ming was escorted to the First Special Court. Prosecutor Ru Bao Yi requested a postponement because the accomplices were still at large. Bao confessed that he had seized a pack of heroin at the time and did not deny the attempted fraud. Judge Feng Shi De checked the confession and ordered Bao to be detained and the case postponed for further hearing.

### Mongolian Low-Pressure System Continues to Advance Shanghai Climate: Summer in Winter Recent Temperatures Rise to Over 70 Degrees High Pressure Forming, Weather Will Change Dramatically

Due to the influence of a low-pressure system advancing southeast from Mongolia, the local weather is unusually warm, like early summer, and light clothing is suitable. However, a high-pressure system is forming in Siberia, so Shanghai's weather is likely to change dramatically.

Summer in Winter

According to a Datong News Agency reporter, local temperatures have risen to over 70 degrees Fahrenheit in recent days, resembling early summer. The weather is exceptionally warm, and light clothing is sufficient with no feeling of cold. This abnormal phenomenon is rare in the dead of winter. In previous years, by this time, the roads would have been covered in ice and snow.

Dramatic Change Imminent

According to observations from the observatory, the coldest temperatures in Siberia, Russia, have fallen to over 30 degrees Celsius below zero, indicating the formation of a high-pressure system. If it advances southeast, Shanghai's weather will change dramatically, and the onset of extreme cold is not far off. In addition, there has been very little rain this winter, and the climate is dry, so common illnesses such as colds and diphtheria are very prevalent. Residents should pay close attention to maintaining their health.

### The Closed Dachang Xieji Silk and Satin Store Manager Arrested for Embezzlement Over 20,000 Yuan in Funds Misappropriated Further Investigation of Accounts Pending

Dachang Xieji Silk and Satin Store was formerly located at Xiaodongmen, Zhongnanshi, and was jointly established by Wang Zigang and others. After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, it was relocated to No. 397 Nanjing Road and Shanxi Road (the original site of the current Dachangxiang Silk and Satin Store). In the autumn of last year, it suddenly experienced financial difficulties and closed. Wang Zigang entrusted an accountant

to audit the accounts and discovered that most of the store's capital had been transferred and lent to Dada Silk Store at No. 10, Lane 351, Fujian Road. Further investigation revealed that the Dada Silk Store was established by Wu Yun Xuan (from Suzhou), the store manager, and Yin Nian Chun (from Suzhou), the assistant manager, who used their positions and opportunities to transfer Dachang's capital to their own store, causing Dachang

to close down. This was in violation of the store's regulations, which stipulated that capital could not be used for other purposes. Further investigation revealed that the amount of misappropriated funds was over 23,539 yuan. The report was made to the General Police Station, and Chief Detective Jiang Shang Pei and Detective Song Yuan Shan investigated and confirmed the facts. Wu and Yin were arrested the day before yesterday and escorted to the First Criminal Court of the First Special District yesterday morning.

Wu and Yin hired lawyers Fan Gang and Yu En Liang for their defense. The police prosecutor, Ru Bao Yi, stated that the accounts in this case were complex and the investigation would take time, so he requested a postponement to allow sufficient time for a detailed investigation. After questioning by Judge Feng Shi De, it was ordered that both Wu and Yin be detained for one week for further questioning.

### Dispute Over Dismantling of Storefront Window Self-Demolisher Arrested

Wu Xian Qing (from Ningbo), the owner of the Hongda Hat Shop at the intersection of Sanma Road and Shilu Road, previously leased the storefront window of the Nanyang Shoe Store at No. 565, Route du Consulat, from Qu Yu Chang, the owner of the Nanyang Shoe Store, to sell hats. He had also leased a pavilion room as a warehouse and dormitory for his employees for many years. Recently, Qu transferred the Nanyang Shoe Store to Wang Guang Yu, who opened the Dahua Shoe and Hat Store. After Qu asked Wu to vacate the premises, Wu dismantled the copper-framed chrome hat racks and other equipment he had installed. Wang Guang Yu reported this to the French Police, accusing Wu of theft. Wu did not go to the police station for questioning, but instead hired a lawyer to file a private prosecution with the Criminal Division of the Second Special Court, accusing Wang Guang Yu of falsely accusing him of theft and requesting an investigation. The court held a hearing the day before yesterday. The plaintiff was represented by a lawyer who presented the case and stated that the plaintiff feared that the defendant would notify the police to wait outside the court to arrest him and subject him to torture. Therefore, he did not appear in court. The defendant appeared in court with his lawyers Xu Wu Fang and Chen Hai Sen. After the court admonished the parties, the hearing was postponed for further questioning. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. It is now learned that the plaintiff, Wu Xian Qing, was present with his lawyer at the time of the hearing. During the hearing, he sat in the audience and listened to the proceedings, deliberately not appearing in court and having his lawyer state the reasons for his absence. However, after Wu walked out of the courthouse, detectives from the French Police Station were waiting outside to arrest him. He was taken to the Loujiawan General Police Station. After questioning by the Western Inspector, he was instructed to await investigation and be escorted to the court for review.

He then took advantage of the situation to escape without a trace. Afterwards, a store employee named Huang Wen Yuan discovered this and immediately reported it to the police station by telephone. Detectives were dispatched to retrieve the overcoat and Mauser pistol and to take the store owner, Mr. Wang (from Guangdong), the accountant, Lv Pei (from Shanghai), and Huang Wen Yuan to the police station for questioning.

### Glucose Calcium Reaction Issue Defendant's Rebuttal Reasons

This newspaper published an article yesterday entitled "Strong Reaction Occurs After Injection of Glucose Calcium." The following are the supplemental rebuttal reasons from Mr. Wu Zhi Wei, the defendant, through his attorney, Mr. A. Le Man:

Dear Sir, This is to state that my client, Mr. Wu Zhi Wei, claims that he has read today's Shen Bao, which contains a news item about Dr. Yu Ting Xiang's private prosecution of me for negligent injury. The content focuses on the plaintiff's statements, while the defendant's rebuttals are omitted in detail, and some important facts of the case are not included. I am sincerely afraid that the general public will develop misunderstandings, and I should supplement as follows:

(1) This criminal private prosecution was filed after Dr. Yu requested compensation for damages, and I reasonably refused. In other words, if I had initially disregarded the truth and compromised and agreed to compensation, Dr. Yu would not have filed a criminal suit. However, I have a clear conscience and will naturally not succumb.

(2) The main reason Dr. Yu sued, believing I was at fault, was that Pro Strong Company of America is not a member of the American Medical Association, so I should not distribute its products. However, the association is the American Medical Association, and pharmaceutical manufacturers do not need to be and cannot join. Therefore, his reasons for prosecution are completely wrong.

(3) Pro Strong Company's glucose calcium products are sold worldwide and have an excellent reputation. If Dr. Yu believes that the company's products should not be used, why did he suddenly use them on his patient? Why did he use them on himself again after several days? Furthermore, if the drug is indeed improper, why can't Dr. Yu present any chemical evidence to prove his claim until the case is heard?

(4) Whether it is appropriate for Dr. Yu to inject glucose calcium for his own cold and cough is already questionable. Furthermore, whether the injection of the needle was timely, and whether the disinfection was thorough are all relevant. Now that the company's drugs have proven to be flawless, in fact, the cause of the reaction described by Dr. Yu should be investigated by Dr. Yu himself.

It has been determined that the case has now been debated and will be decided by the court on the 11th of this month. I deeply believe that justice is in the hearts of the people, and right and wrong are not difficult to clarify. There is no need to debate further now, but because the news item is easy to give the public an inaccurate impression, I should ask the lawyer to send a letter to the newspaper to request a supplementary correction. Accordingly, I have sent a letter on behalf of my client, hoping that you will review and handle it accordingly. Sincerely, Attorney A. Le Man, January 6, 29th year. The court ruled that the ruling will be delivered by public notice.

### Husband Files for Divorce Defendant Not Summoned

### An Overview of the Promotion of Compulsory Education in China (Part 3)

(IV) Implementation Procedures

In accordance with the regulations of the Outline of the Compulsory Education Implementation Plan and its Detailed Rules, the implementation procedures for promoting compulsory education are as follows: Each county and city should first divide elementary school districts as units for establishing elementary schools, investigate the number of school-age children to enforce school attendance, organize compulsory education committees at all levels to assist education administrative organs at all levels in implementing compulsory education, strengthen education administrative structures at all levels to facilitate the promotion of compulsory education, and establish compulsory education supervisors to specifically oversee compulsory education. The various measures are outlined below:

A. Division of Elementary School Districts. Regarding the division of elementary school districts, the Measures for the Division of Elementary School Districts in Cities and Counties have been formulated and revised, stipulating that each elementary school district should have a population of 1,000 people in principle. However, local areas may flexibly adapt this based on the population density, local transportation conditions, and existing local self-governance or Baojia organizations. Five to ten elementary school districts are combined into a joint elementary school district with one school director. Each elementary school district has one assistant school director responsible for investigating school-age children in the district, planning schools, persuading or forcing children to attend school, and raising funds to supervise and improve private schools. Every three or more joint elementary school districts or each autonomous region should be divided into a county school district, with one education committee member to guide all educational matters within the district.

B. Organization of Compulsory Education Committees at All Levels. The National Compulsory Education Committee, an agency assisting the Ministry of Education in promoting national compulsory education, was established in August of the 24th year [of the Republic]. In addition to the Minister, Vice Minister, counselors, supervisors, and section chiefs serving as ex officio members according to regulations, several experts from outside the Ministry are also appointed as members. Its main tasks include developing and reviewing compulsory education implementation plans, reviewing all regulations and measures related to compulsory education, and evaluating the performance of compulsory education in various provinces and cities. The organizational regulations of the committee were revised in the 26th year [of the Republic] and this year [of the Republic], and staff have recently been added to strengthen the organization to facilitate progress. Provincial and municipal compulsory education committees, agencies assisting provincial and municipal education departments in promoting compulsory education in their respective provinces and cities, were also established in the 24th year [of the Republic]. In addition to the heads of provincial and municipal education administrative agencies serving as chairmen, section chiefs and supervisors serve as ex officio members, and several respected figures from the education sector are appointed as members by the provincial and municipal governments. Their tasks include formulating provincial compulsory education implementation plans, supervising the management and use of provincial and municipal compulsory education funds and central government subsidies for compulsory education in the provinces and cities, drafting annual teacher training methods, and evaluating the performance of compulsory education in various counties and cities. County and city compulsory education committees, agencies assisting county and city education bureaus in promoting compulsory education in their respective counties and cities, have been established in most counties across the country. Their tasks include formulating county and city compulsory education promotion plans, supervising the management and use of county and city compulsory education funds and subsidies from higher-level governments, and evaluating the performance of compulsory education in subordinate areas. Recently, in accordance with the resolutions of the Third National Education Conference, the National Compulsory Education Committee is formulating mutual liaison and guidance measures for compulsory education committees at various levels below the provincial level to strengthen their organization.

C. Strengthening Education Administrative Structures at All Levels. Regarding the administration of compulsory education at all levels, in the 25th year [of the Republic], provincial and municipal education departments were ordered to establish special compulsory education sections or compulsory education units within the primary education sections. County education bureaus were instructed to assign one staff member to handle compulsory education specifically. In addition to the original supervisors conducting inspections on a regular basis, compulsory education supervisors may be appointed at any time to supervise compulsory education in various provinces and cities. Furthermore, regulations for compulsory education supervisors in provinces, cities, and counties were issued, stipulating that each province and city should establish several compulsory education supervisors to supervise compulsory education by region, and each county and city should establish several compulsory education supervisors to supervise compulsory education in the county and city by region, to facilitate the supervision and guidance of compulsory education promotion. Recently, with the promulgation of the Outline of County-Level Organizations, there have been slight changes to the county education administrative organization. The Ministry of Education is currently working on formulating an outline of the county education administrative organization to facilitate implementation.

D. Training Administrative Cadres for Compulsory Education. In the 25th year [of the Republic], provincial and municipal education departments were ordered to send administrative personnel in charge of compulsory education, current or prospective leaders of compulsory education teacher training classes, to the Ministry to participate in training courses for administrative cadres of compulsory education. The training period lasted for two months. In addition to inviting experts to temporarily lecture on compulsory education issues, the focus was on the discussion of practical problems. The results of the discussions were quite impressive and were compiled into a collection of discussions on practical issues in compulsory education, which was distributed to various provinces and cities. Almost all difficult problems in promoting compulsory education have solutions in this collection, making it a valuable reference for education agencies in various provinces and cities. After the promulgation of the Outline of County-Level Organizations, various provinces and cities should establish public national schools and township (zhen) central schools on a wide scale. The large number of teachers required should be trained quickly through widely established teacher training classes in the respective provinces and cities. Personnel responsible for operating these teacher training classes should first be centrally gathered for training. The Ministry of Education is currently formulating training methods and will periodically convene training in batches.

(V) Implementation Methods

According to the provisions of the Outline of the Compulsory Education Plan and the Detailed Rules for Implementation, various provinces should promote compulsory education by establishing short-term elementary schools and elementary schools to accommodate out-of-school children in various regions. The methods are as follows:

A. Establishing Short-Term Elementary Schools on a Wide Scale. In areas where education funding is insufficient, within the designated school districts, one-year short-term elementary schools should first be established to enroll out-of-school children aged eight to twelve. These schools should adopt a two-shift system in principle, with each shift teaching for half a day (or adopting alternate-day or intermittent teaching), with each shift teaching for at least three or four hours. The duration of study is one year in the first phase, two years in the second phase, and gradually converting to four-year elementary schools in the third phase.

B. Promoting Four-Year Elementary Schools. In areas where education funding is sufficient, there is no need to establish short-term elementary schools, and four-year elementary schools can be established instead.

C. Fully Utilizing Existing Elementary School Quotas. In all grades of existing elementary schools, if the number of students is insufficient, efforts must be made to enroll enough children to fill the quotas.

D. Improving Private Schools. All regions are required to improve existing private schools, with the teachers being gathered in batches for training in advance. Efforts must be made to ensure that all private schools are operated in accordance with the short-term elementary school methods.

E. Implementing Itinerant Teaching on a Trial Basis. All regions are ordered to establish itinerant teachers to go to remote and inaccessible areas to teach out-of-school children. The level of instruction should be the same as that of short-term elementary schools.

Fan Jinyong, Lu Shouxian, Feng Shoupeng, Chen Yuanji, Wu Shaotai, Dai Renda, Li Yao, Yao Guanfan, Yan Yongchang, Zhang Baoxing, Fei Chunhua

### Finance - Foreign Exchange Rises and Falls Rapidly - British Gold Briefly Drops Five Pence and Then Recovers - US Exchange Rate Repeatedly Falls Back into the Eight Yuan Range

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw the HSBC official rates reveal a consistent long position. British gold was up by two and five forties of a penny, making it four and a half pence. The US exchange rate was up by half a yuan, making it seven yuan and three seventy-five. The unofficial market for British and American exchange rates fluctuated sharply, which was rare recently. Originally, rumors have been rampant recently, causing unease, and the trend initially eased and then tightened sharply, with extremely intense reactions. In the normal course of the day, the market opened with a long position in US and British exchange rates, leading to a tight British and flat US exchange rate. Subsequently, inheriting the residual power of the previous day's selling, coupled with the widespread peaceful atmosphere, caused many Chinese merchants with long positions to panic and close their positions. Moreover, Hong Kong telegrams also came to sell, while foreign firms had very little intention to buy. For a time, positions were overflowing. In less than half an hour, British gold broke the five-pence mark, reaching five pence point zero three one two five. The US exchange rate also called over eight yuan point three one two five. Unexpectedly, rumors suddenly emerged that the Ministry of Finance was about to issue gold treasury bills. HSBC suddenly came in to take advantage of the low prices, profiting and closing positions, while Chinese banks also began to buy on behalf of certain major clients. Foreign firms and some Chinese merchants also followed suit. However, the intention to sell was extremely weak, so those who followed the trend were too numerous to count, and the rebound was very strong, and the market was extremely chaotic. Until the close of trading, British gold was only four pence point seven eight one two five, and the US exchange rate was only seven yuan point eight one two five. As a result, compared with the previous day, British gold was tighter by one point eight seven five, and the US was softer by two point eight one two five. The underlying potential of futures remained the same as the spot market.

Chinese Merchants Actively Involved in Futures

At the beginning of the morning, London's broad bars saw a rise of two five in the near term and a rise of one eight seven five in the far term. The price of raw silk remained flat, and the price of London gold was stable. Exchange rates were flat between the UK, US, and France, and up by two five against Shanghai. The US was up by eight seven five against the UK, up by three and a half jiao against Shanghai, and up by six two five against France. The central government's official rates for various exchange rates remained the same. The bank's opening price for spot sales in the morning was four pence point nine three seven five for British gold and eight yuan point zero nine three seven five for the US exchange rate, which was up by zero point zero three one two five for British gold and unchanged for the US exchange rate compared with the previous closing, due to the rebound in exchange rates. After the opening, Hong Kong telegrams first came to sell three, and speculators also came to close their long positions, so the market continued to be strong. Until 9:25 AM, British gold broke the five-pence mark, reaching five pence point zero three one two five, and the US exchange rate also rose to eight yuan point three one two five. The HSBC official rates revealed an increase of two five for British gold and half a yuan for the US exchange rate. The official tax rate for white silver was announced to be up by one point two five. After that, the market suddenly changed, because HSBC successively absorbed existing sterling at five pence and existing US dollars at eight yuan point two five, which led foreign firms to rush to buy. In addition, foreign firms took profits, and Chinese banks such as Guohua Continental also actively participated in the spot futures market. In addition, speculators had stopped selling, and although foreign firms such as Datong had intentions to supply, they all took the opportunity to raise prices, so the rebound was quite strong. Until 10:20 AM, British gold had returned to the five-pence mark, falling to four pence point nine zero six two five, and the US exchange rate had also shrunk to the eight-yuan mark. Subsequently, some Chinese merchants came to buy in, causing the situation to continue to tighten until the close of trading, without any return. The bank's spot selling price for British gold was only four pence point seven eight one two five, and the US exchange rate was only yuan point eight one two five. The next-month futures for British gold were four pence point seven five, and the US exchange rate was seven yuan point seven five. As a result, compared with the previous day, the spot and futures for British gold were both tighter by one point eight seven five, and the US were both softer by two point eight one two five. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday.

Hong Kong Exchange Market Unstable

Hong Kong, 6th. The exchange market opened this morning with an unstable market. The British, US, and Japanese exchange rates were unchanged. The spot exchange rate for Shanghai yuan fell sharply by sixteen yuan to two hundred and eighty-eight yuan. At 10:35 AM, the market was slightly flat, and the market was naturally unstable. The spot exchange rate for Shanghai yuan rose by six yuan to two hundred and ninety-four yuan. At 11:10 AM, there was a slight hardening. The spot exchange rate for Shanghai yuan continued to rise by two yuan to two hundred and ninety-six yuan. The spot exchange rate for Japanese yuan eased by two five to one hundred and three yuan point two five. At 11:30 AM, it turned hard. The near-term exchange rate for British yuan and the spot exchange rate for Japanese yuan were unchanged. The spot exchange rate for US yuan eased by zero six two five to twenty-four yuan point four three seven five. The spot exchange rate for Shanghai yuan rose by another five yuan to two hundred and one yuan. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday.

Tianjin British Exchange Rate at Five Pence

Tianjin, 6th. The exchange market opened with chaos this morning. The spot exchange rate for British yuan rose by one eight seven five to five pence. The spot exchange rate for US yuan eased by three one two five to eight yuan point one eight seven five. The Shanghai yuan fell by one yuan and seven jiao and a half to one hundred yuan point zero zero seven jiao and a half. The unofficial market for "Joint Currency" was two yuan lower at ninety-six yuan and a half.

### Both Favorable and Unfavorable Arguments - Gold Prices Fall and Then Rebound Sharply - The Four Thousand Yuan Mark Almost Broken - Rumors of Gold Certificates Spark a Rebound

Yesterday's unofficial cash and red market conditions, with the environment suddenly improving again, although the initial opening was still weak, suddenly turned extremely tight due to the exchange market. The long position exaggerated and fabricated the atmosphere, causing speculators to hesitate, while those who intended to buy began to drag, and the chips felt exhausted. Therefore, the result was a sharp rise of fifty-nine yuan. In the early morning, due to the continued easing of the exchange market and the difficulty in dissipating the peaceful atmosphere, people's hearts were sluggish and uninspired. Retail investors all had intentions to sell, rushing to sell short, causing the opening price to plummet by forty-three yuan to four thousand and ten yuan. Continued to fall by another twenty yuan, falling to a low of four thousand yuan. At this time, the exchange market rapidly tightened, and the rumor that the Ministry of Finance was about to issue gold treasury bills resurfaced in the market, causing buyers to perk up. Securities firms, a certain bank, and two major currency exchange firms successively bought on behalf of Hong Kong, etc., while the short positions became more urgent. Although a certain gold firm was still selling, they were ultimately outnumbered, and the price soared. The high price of four thousand one hundred and twenty-five yuan appeared before the midday close. The closing price was four thousand one hundred and twenty-two yuan. There was no market in the afternoon, but the unofficial market was still firm at first, rising a few more yuan to four thousand one hundred and thirty yuan. Later, a certain firm came to sell, and bullion shops also had intentions to supply, so it fell back. It was heard that the final price had fallen to around four thousand one hundred and ten yuan. The volume of transactions in the morning was about two thousand taels. The price of gold jewelry rose by five yuan, and the price of customs duty remained flat.

Red Gold Rebounds by Fifty-Nine Yuan

Since the beginning of the morning, the price per tael (ten taels) has been scattered and weak. Because the foreign exchange rate continues to be strong, some floating investors sell short quite aggressively, and those who enter wait and see. The opening price is immediately slammed down by forty-three yuan. The money exchange firm sells twenty taels in full, for four thousand and twenty yuan. After a short time, under the selling pressure, it fell by another twenty yuan, and the money exchange firm did twenty taels, for four thousand yuan. Unexpectedly, at this time, the exchange market suddenly tightened, and the buying interest suddenly intensified, and the price immediately jumped up horizontally. In an instant, it had risen by fifty-five yuan. The gold firm entered thirty taels for the securities firm, for four thousand and fifty-five yuan. At that time, the securities firm sold more than one hundred taels, and the bullion firm also sold three, so it was once again pressed down to a small amount of four thousand and thirty yuan. After that, a certain firm in the securities firm vigorously entered, and at the same time, the money exchange firm also came to buy, and it was pulled back to four thousand and fifty-five yuan. Afterwards, a certain gold firm fiercely sold more than two hundred taels, and the rising trend was suppressed again for a while, and it fell again to four thousand and thirty-five yuan. Because the foreign exchange tightened greatly, the buying atmosphere was pervasive. A certain money exchange firm vigorously searched and bought on behalf of customers, and at the same time, securities firms also released disks and searched for purchases. In addition, floating positions were compensated, and it soon jumped sixty-seven yuan out of the four thousand one hundred yuan mark, and the securities firm entered ten taels for the money exchange firm, for four thousand one hundred and two yuan. At that time, the gold firm sold again, and the money exchange firm also slightly rebounded, and it retreated again to four thousand and eighty yuan. Afterwards, because the foreign exchange market continued to tighten, the buying interest was agitated again. A certain money exchange firm again bought on behalf of Hong Kong, and at the same time, the securities firm also released disks to search for purchases, and short positions were compensated, and it rose again by forty-five yuan, and the money exchange firm entered twenty taels for the securities firm, for four thousand one hundred and twenty-five yuan. Later, the money exchange firm released ten taels to the gold firm, for four thousand one hundred and twenty-two yuan, the closing price in the afternoon, and the result was that it rebounded by fifty-nine yuan compared to the previous day. The spot gold selling price of the local brand of the cash gold number was a few yuan higher than the cash gold, and the buying price was reduced by 20 yuan. The spot gold was more than fifty yuan lower than the official gold, and there was little business.

Gold Jewelry Also Hung Up by Five Yuan

At the beginning, the hanging price of gold jewelry per tael in bullion shops was still four hundred and ten yuan for Datong Bank, and it was changed by five yuan until 11 o'clock. Since then, there has been no change. As a result, Datong Bank changed to hanging four hundred and fifteen yuan, and the new colleague was the same as the above price. The purchasing price was reduced by about 15 yuan.

### Foreign Currency Fluctuations Abound

Yesterday, foreign currency experienced dramatic fluctuations. Initially, ample supply led to a loose and flooded market. Subsequently, rumors of gold coin and note issuance spread, causing a sudden surge in demand and a stronger market. British and American gold pounds rebounded strongly. The US dollar note once fell to $12.20 in the morning, and the British silver note fell to $45. However, it quickly reversed and rose significantly. The evening market saw the US dollar note rise to $12.83, and the British gold note rise to $45.80. Hong Kong dollar and French franc notes also initially weakened before strengthening, ultimately rising significantly. Demand for Canadian and Philippine notes was strong, leading to high market prices. The Japanese gold note market was weak, with the evening market at $1.365. The Korean currency continued to weaken, with the evening market at $1.09. Yesterday's market prices saw the British and American gold pounds rise by $1.50 each, the British gold note rise by $0.80, the US dollar note rise by $0.46, the Hong Kong dollar rise by $0.04, the French franc rise by $0.005, the Canadian dollar rise by $0.20, and the Philippine dollar rise by $0.10. Other currencies remained unchanged.

### Securities: Domestic and Foreign Bonds Continue to Soar

The gray market for securities remained quite good yesterday. Class C stock astonishingly broke through the $50 mark, and Class B stock broke through the $2 mark, showing a very favorable trend. However, after several days of rising, many held floating profits and sought to cash in, causing slight market fluctuations. The atmosphere of peace remained strong, seemingly driven by certain parties' desires, as evidenced by slogans in the occupied territories and the statements of the manager of the Yokohama Specie Bank's London branch. Furthermore, there were rumors of a return of the Song family to power, suggesting that peace was not far off. Despite market fluctuations, the market sentiment and environmental conditions indicated a predominantly upward trend, as most buyers belonged to the financial sector. In the morning session, No. 16 and Da Feng were the most active buyers. Hong Da Heng Fu and Lian Yi also saw strong buying interest. Run Li Lian He and Jiu Feng saw many bulls cashing out. Tong Shun bought Class A and sold domestic bonds. Other small investors also cashed out. Class C stock reached $50.03, and Class B stock reached $52.50. Later, due to profit-taking, prices slightly retreated. In the afternoon, No. 38 and Da Feng continued to buy in large quantities. Lian Yi Ju Xin and Heng Fu also saw buying interest, but many holders of floating profits rushed to sell due to the sudden rise in gold prices. Class C stock re-entered the $50 range, ultimately ending slightly higher by $0.15 to $0.25. Total transaction volume exceeded $1.1 million. A summary table is provided below.

Stock transactions: 30 shares of Guohua Bank stock were traded at a price of $50.

London, May 5th: Today's listed prices for Chinese foreign bonds remained stable, with no changes in any of the French bonds.

London, May 5th: Today's listed prices for British Far Eastern companies' stocks saw continued gains in bank stocks. Mercantile Bank rose 1 shilling 3 pence to £8 15s. Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation shares continued to rise by £1, with shares registered in London at £84.50 and shares registered in Hong Kong at £86.50. The rest remained stable.

Yesterday's stock market at the public exchange was extremely lively and exciting. Public attention remained focused on rubber stocks, while various industrial stocks also reached new highs. Trading was most active in the morning, with prices rising steadily. However, as those who profited rushed to cash out, the rise in low-priced rubber stocks was dampened. The closing market was extremely firm. Closing prices are listed below.

### Grains: Rice Sales Stagnant

Price per "hu" (unit of volume) Continues to Drop by 2-3 Cents

After briefly tightening the day before yesterday, early morning trading of japonica rice continued to show a positive outlook. However, reports that sources of supply from the interior, such as early and late rice from Nan'gang, were difficult to transport, and that only a few shipments arrived in Hongkou for redistribution, led guest diners to view the various goods in hand as an opportunity to profit, unwilling to easily sell. Buyers, believing in the yesterday's line of prosperity, continued to show interest in purchasing, making many inquiries. As a result, sellers lacked the ability to bargain up prices, and initially saw a slight increase. However, the market suddenly saw the release of no less than 1,000-2,000 bags of early and late rice from Hongkou being sold in the market, and large quantities of foreign rice also followed suit, flooding the market with both spot and futures goods. Although sales were good, there was ultimately a lack of capacity to absorb it all, and the market saw an imbalance between supply and demand. Buyers inevitably became discouraged and returned to observing. Sales quickly became sluggish, and sellers, seeking to sell, had no choice but to cut prices. Therefore, a decline quickly set in, with both japonica rice, domestic rice, and various foreign rice varieties falling by 2-3 cents. Ultimately, it was felt that it was difficult to reverse the market sentiment, with little success. As a result, early and late rice, which had been quoted at $37 in the morning, closed at only $36.45. Saigon rice initially traded at $36.50, but later only $36.12.

Foreign rice: Inventories are full and supplies continue to arrive. Recently, in addition to direct shipments from Saigon to Shanghai, shipments from Hong Kong have also frequently arrived in small quantities. The low-priced Saigon rice and broken rice will also all arrive in Shanghai and are scheduled to be sold soon. Furthermore, the pricing of regular rice and broken rice can still be unified. Therefore, merchants and customers lack the capacity to absorb them. Yesterday, less than 3,000 bags were traded. Grade 1 Saigon rice has returned to $36.35, regular rice to $35, and high-quality broken rice to $31.80. Lower quality broken rice has retreated slightly to $29.20, which is a small decrease of 3-5 cents compared to the previous market.

### Flour Steady, Wheat Still Popular

Flour: Yesterday, the flour market continued to be stable. Sales to local customers were sluggish due to the weekend. Furthermore, goods previously ordered from Tianjin and Hong Kong are still being reported for import. Demand for New Year's goods on this street is still early. Flour factories, while having ordered foreign wheat, are unwilling to process and produce due to still-high costs, and are only willing to sell as they produce. Therefore, total transaction volume was less than 30,000 bags. The Grade 1 flour factory continued to quote $9, the price of returned goods from the Warship brand was $9.35, and the price of Lu Pao Che (brand name) flour to customers still required $9.50. The market was particularly stable. Transactions of Japanese factory flour were not active. The January Phoenix brand was quoted at $9.034, and ultimately fluctuated around $9.10. Today, 10,950 bags of flour were shipped to Xiamen, and 3,000 bags were shipped to Hong Kong.

Wheat: The wheat market remained strong. Domestic wheat prices are currently high, and supply has been lacking for a long time. Although factories have ordered foreign wheat, concerns remain that supply will take considerable time and that prices will ultimately be higher than domestic wheat. Therefore, holders of goods continue to insist and are unwilling to easily sell, leading to a favorable outlook. Suzhou white wheat was priced at $15.55, Wuxi and Changzhou wheat at $15.50, and Pudong wheat at $15.40. Fuxin factory purchased 1,000 bags and Fufeng purchased 2,000 bags.

### Yarn and Cotton: Many Forced to Cut Losses, Yarn Prices Plummet

Shuang Ma (Double Horse) Reaches a Low of $721

The yarn market continued to decline, and the decline was particularly severe. This was due to falling cotton prices overseas, the great victory in northern Guangdong, and the increasingly severe easing of foreign exchange. Many holders of floating profits panicked and rushed to sell and close out positions in the market. At the same time, real demand remained sluggish and lacked vitality, and buyers were also lacking. For the January and February Shuang Ma yarn, a de facto speculative instrument, selling pressure was high and the market became increasingly unsustainable. 20-count Shuang Ma once plummeted to $721. Soon after, around 11:30 AM, news of a tightening in foreign exchange caused a slight dissipation of the atmosphere of panic. However, actual business was too sluggish.

Spot yarn opened in the morning due to overseas factors favoring shortages, coupled with news that the exchange market was expected to ease further, making the market listless. 20-count Shuang Ma opened at $730, down $10. Continuing news of increasingly easy exchange rates led to further declines, once reaching $721. Trading of January and February futures was extremely lively. By closing, prices had rebounded again due to the tightening of foreign exchange. 20-count Xie Ma closed at $728. Total transaction volume for half a day was 1,600 bales. Prices for 20-count Shuang Ma fell by $13, Shuang Di Qiu (Double Globe) fell by $15, and Tian Nu (Heavenly Woman) fell by $15. Today, 205 bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong, 30 bales were shipped to Haikou, 100 bales were shipped to Haiphong, and 115 bales were shipped to Xiamen. A breakdown of the amount purchased by each guild is listed below.

### Japanese Factories Actively Buy, Cotton Sales Improve

Transactions of domestic cotton have become more active, with sales between companies being particularly improved. Demand from Qingdao is strong, while business in Shanghai is secondary. Of yesterday's transactions, Fuchengxin purchased about 50% of the goods, which were mostly used for transportation to the north. Shanghai-based Japanese factories also made purchases at the opening, so the cotton market remained stable. However, American cotton saw a decline, while instant cotton remained on a tight and expensive path. Supplies from northern Jiangsu included 5,870 bales of Tonghua, 1,677 bales from Changyinsha, and 1,750 bales from Beisha. The situation of spot cotton opening transactions is listed on the left.

Another report on foreign cotton market prices: The New York cotton market was very strong in the early morning due to overseas buyers in the market, leading to rising prices. Later, due to hedging by southern companies and profit-taking by bulls, the market turned weak, resulting in a closing price that was 10 points lower than the previous day. Indian cotton, including forecasts, fell by 4 rupees. Egyptian cotton rose by 60 pounds. Liverpool cotton rose by 20 pence.

Shanghai Foreign Cotton Transactions: All parties are wary of making purchases due to the excessive fluctuations in exchange rates and the proliferation of various rumors. Factories are also unwilling to make advances due to the sharp fall in yarn prices. Therefore, trading throughout the day was unusually quiet. Yesterday's cotton market prices, converted to factory delivery prices using an exchange rate of $8 to the US dollar, are as follows:

### Oil Market: Soybean Oil Prices Fall

Yesterday's soybean oil market saw prices fall across the board due to the impending arrival of crude oil shipments from Dalian. 120 pieces of Jiaozhou oil were opened at a price of $74 to $74.50. 300 pieces of Qingqi oil were priced at $77. 300 pieces of Yanqi oil were priced at $78. 70 barrels of Qingdao oil were priced at $100. 50 barrels of Jiangbei oil were priced at $100, and 200 cans of canned oil were priced at $98. 30 barrels of Changzhou oil from the factory were priced at $101, and 20 barrels of Bengbu oil were priced at $100. Although market prices have now fallen back, it is hoped that powerful forces will not release their demonic hands and become the indirect culprits of murder again.

Today, 5,914 cans of crude oil and 250 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong, and 150 pieces were shipped to Xiamen.

### Sugar Market: Chaoqing and Diaoqing Varieties From Production Areas Have Entered the Market

Yesterday, the sugar market trended flat, with little fluctuation. The guild's price list for spot goods showed Grade 2 and 4 coarse white sugar at $58.50 at the main warehouse, $59 for newly arrived goods at outside warehouses, $59 for old goods, and $48 for re-exports. Taikoo brand white B mark was $59 at the east warehouse and $59.30 at the west warehouse. CW mark was $59, CX mark was $58.70, DY mark was $58.50, and HX mark was $58. Prices for cart red and Dutch red remained unchanged. Grade 1 of the Ben Mian brand white sugar was $58.50, Grade 2 was $58, Grade 1 crystal sugar was $68.50, and Jingming crystal sugar was $70. According to information from cargo owners, the production area of domestic Diaoqing sugar has seen new crops, but as shipments are not active and prices remain high, there are few shipments to Shanghai. Only half of the harvest has been collected, and it is feared that it may not be suitable. This is because cargo arriving by Japanese ships is priced more favorably, with a slight decrease of $2. Yesterday, the Jian gang opened over 200 bags at $44, and 120 bags of ordinary Han red at $39. According to news from Shantou, this year's harvest of new Chaoqing is only 50%, and production prices remain too high to be suitable.

### Textiles: Cotton Cloth Rebounds in the Afternoon, Sales Stronger to the Nanyang Guild

Domestic Cloth: Cotton cloth continued the weak trend from the previous day. The early market saw continued easing of foreign exchange, leading to a relaxed market sentiment and a surge in selling pressure. Prices in various cloth markets retreated by about $0.05 per bolt, and buyers' interest was weak, resulting in a sharp decline in transaction volume. However, the exchange market suddenly contracted in the afternoon, and all cloths rebounded in unison, approaching the original prices. As a result, prices fell slightly by $0.10 to $0.25 per bolt.

The Nanyang Guild traded over 5,000 bolts of bleached cloth, colored cloth, and printed cloth. The Sichuan-Yunnan Guild traded over 6,000 bolts of colored cloth, colored twill, bleached cloth, and colored satin. The Guangdong-Fujian Guild traded over 100 boxes of colored twill. The local street traded over 300 pieces of fine cloth, fine twill, and group cloth.

Eastern Cloth: In the morning market, due to the continued rise in foreign exchange, market sentiment turned weak. Prices for white and colored goods declined. 12-pound Longtou fine cloth opened at a low price of $21.35. Jiao Junzi Serge fell to $0.06575 per yard. By the afternoon session, the rise in yarn prices caused a strong reaction. In the late market, Longtou fine cloth rose to $22 per bolt, and Four Gentlemen Serge rose to $0.068, while Straight Tribute rose to $0.071. The market situation tightened suddenly and showed signs of continued gains. All colleagues on the Japanese street sought to purchase over 700 pieces of fine cloth and fine twill.

Exports: Today, 225 pieces of textiles were shipped to Xiamen, 37 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong, 36 pieces were shipped to Singapore, 40 pieces were shipped to Guangzhou Bay, 21 pieces were shipped to Haimen, and 501 pieces were shipped to Haiphong.

### North and South Goods: Persimmon Cakes Fall

Recent shipments of persimmon cakes have been strong, reaching a total of over 500 pieces. Boxed Zhuang Pai cakes are priced at $28, and Qing cakes are priced at $25 to $26, a decrease of $2-3 compared to before, not yet open for sale.

### Coal: Wenzhou Charcoal Arrives - Over 10,000-20,000 Baskets -

The city's charcoal supply relies entirely on the Yangtze River and eastern Zhejiang. Since the Sino-Japanese War, the Yangtze River source has been completely cut off, relying only on shipments from eastern Zhejiang. Transportation has been obstructed, preventing smooth flow, so prices have gradually risen. Although shipments have arrived in steady streams recently, prices have not decreased. The Norwegian ship Xin An Mao, represented by Xie Ji Company, arrived from Wenzhou with over 20,000 baskets of charcoal last night and unloaded at the Observatory Wharf in the French Concession.

### French Boy Scouts in the European War

— Tian Shi

The heroic defense of the Sihang Warehouse by the 88th Division often reminds us of Ms. Yang Huimin's courageous delivery of the splendid national emblem into the encirclement. The glorious historical facts published by the China Boy Scout General Association in Qingmuguan, Jianchuan, shining in succession with Ms. Yang, could perhaps form a great volume. How heroic are the Boy Scouts! Possessing all the essentials of virtue, agility, health, and beauty, and continuously developing without limit.

The founder of the Boy Scouts, British Lord Robert Baden-Powell, said, "You seek peace, but if a country is unfortunately faced with foreign aggression, you are all prepared, always serving the country."

Today, people in the West fully understand that the training and education of Boy Scouts can make them great leaders. Leadership talent requires not only knowledge and learning, but also the tempering of temperament and the forging of character, as well as the ability to act automatically to fulfill their responsibilities. This means that in addition to academic ability, they must also have mental strength and possess the virtue of "being able to obey." If a person can combine the above two strengths and be prepared for everything as Lord Baden-Powell said, they can easily fulfill the ancient Chinese saying, "Preparedness averts peril."

Here, I present the merits of the French Boy Scouts serving their country since the outbreak of the European War, to compare with our own country.

1. Completing the harvest in the fields: As France mobilized, strong men went to the front lines, and farms lacked labor at harvest time. The French Ministry of Agriculture summoned the Boy Scouts to help with the reaping. This is roughly similar to the cooperative autumn harvest of soldiers and civilians from Miluo River to Hengyang in Hunan Province. Our Chinese villagers see soldiers as friends, while French farmers call the Boy Scouts who do everything "smiling soldiers."
2. Digging air-raid shelters in preparation for unexpected emergencies.
3. Riding motorcycles to deliver important letters, which is fast and accurate.
4. Dispersing into the rear, border areas, or along the coast to conduct keen reconnaissance, paying particular attention to the traces of enemy air raids, and practicing various methods of not getting lost in the dark at night.
5. Moving injured people and providing first aid, as well as food and comfort.
6. Evacuating children and the sick.
7. Evacuating the population of large cities.
8. Providing guidance and care at train stations or street corners. In all fairness, their most remarkable achievement was taking care of passengers and regulating traffic at the beginning of the war, thereby accelerating the evacuation from large cities to the interior. A traveler from a neutral country wrote of their experience in Paris:

Three days before dawn, the train entered the dimly lit Gare du Nord in Paris. There were no cars to be seen, nor could one find a porter to carry luggage. Just as one was at a loss, a few Boy Scouts emerged from the darkness, immediately acquiring a car from somewhere unknown. The hopelessly heavy suitcases were all loaded onto the car in an instant. The grateful passengers were about to express their thanks, but the many Boy Scouts had already disappeared. It is also said that an old woman arrived at the station, suffering from a disability that made it difficult for her to walk. In the commotion of the crowd, she suddenly lost her luggage, and the young child she was carrying was also separated midway. But this lonely old woman was not afraid, saying, "With the Boy Scouts here, there is nothing to worry about." Before long, the luggage and the child were indeed helped by the Boy Scouts and nothing was lost. This shows the deep faith that the general public has in the Boy Scouts. Moreover, the work of the Boy Scouts is generally calm and without mistakes, and they greet people with a lively "joy," which is enough to ease the tense atmosphere in times of crisis, and because of the "happy" thoughts of most people, strengthen the ability and spirit to encourage self-improvement.

### Don't Be Shy

— Chen Liang

Shyness is perhaps a natural trait. Young children are generally shy. When meeting slightly unfamiliar elders, relatives, and friends, they often hide away, unwilling to call out a greeting quickly and frankly, or say a word. Only after being forced and instructed by their parents will they reluctantly obey, but with a red face and ears, they quickly run away. This is not because children are impolite, but because they are naturally shy.

Since shyness is a natural trait, it is naturally not to be criticized. However, children cannot develop shyness into a habit, so that they are shy everywhere and timid everywhere. That would create a great obstacle for themselves. For example, in academics, it would have a great impact. Originally, there were doubts in the textbooks, and one was prepared to stand up and ask the teacher, but because of shyness, one dared not raise the doubtful question in front of everyone, for fear of being laughed at. Therefore, one passed over it vaguely, and even as an adult, one still does not understand those doubts, or even regrets it for life. This is a very clear example of suffering from shyness.

Another example is being called to the blackboard by the teacher to solve a problem. Originally, the problem was not difficult, and one could solve it quickly and accurately to get an "A." But because of shyness, when facing the blackboard, one becomes distracted and hesitant. With the chalk in hand, one trembles and dares not write. If the teacher urges them again, they will inevitably make many mistakes. When they are considered careless and stupid, even if they cry out in injustice, how will others understand them? This is also being harmed by shyness.

Although shyness is not considered a bad habit, it can suppress the talents and abilities of children, turn cleverness into stupidity, bury one's will, and become a subordinate. Children may have had such experiences: when the teacher asks you to draw a free drawing, if no one is standing next to you, you will definitely boldly paint a landscape picture or an aerial combat picture. But if the teacher is standing next to you, you become so restrained that you can't even draw a small flying bird. Your courage suddenly becomes narrow, and your talent suddenly cannot be expressed. Isn't that the greatest loss!

Therefore, children must release their courage and break the psychological effects of shyness. Even in a large crowd, say what you want to say, do what you want to do!

### Winter Use Summer Heat

— Su Ming

When the clock struck four, Yonger finally came home from school. The northwest wind on the road was quite terrible on his face, causing him to shrink his head into his coat collar, not daring to stretch it out fully. With great difficulty, he arrived home, his ears already frozen red. Once inside the house, his ears seemed to be burning with heat. As he put down his book, he grumbled, "This cold weather is really unbearable. It's better in the hot weather."

"However, the heat of summer is not easy to bear either," his brother, Zonger, retorted.

"That's right. In winter, we say summer is good, and in hot weather, we think cold weather is good. But why is the climate so uneven? It's so cold that people freeze to death, and so hot that people get dizzy. If we could store the heat of summer and use it in winter, wouldn't that be good?"

"That's right! In summer, our roofs are scorched by the fire-like sun, but at night, that heat is wasted. It's a real pity. If we could store it, it wouldn't be so cold in winter," Zonger said loudly with great enthusiasm.

"Then how do we store the heat?" This question aroused Yonger's interest.

"According to some designs, a water pipe is installed on the roof, and the water is heated by the sun. Then the water is introduced from the pipe into the soil deep underground. Because in this deep stratum, the temperature changes of the air on the surface will not affect the temperature of the water underground, so this heated water can be stored underground. In cold weather, the warm water is sent into a large-tube evaporator. The air pressure is artificially reduced, causing the alcohol to evaporate. (You need to know that when a liquid turns into a gas, it must absorb heat. Conversely, it releases the heat it absorbed. If you boil water, you must add heat for the water to turn into steam.) The alcohol absorbs part of the heat from the water, turning into alcohol vapor. It is released into another device where the pressure is high, and the alcohol vapor condenses back into liquid, releasing the heat it just absorbed, warming the nearby cold water. Then, the hot water is transferred to the steam pipe and passed into each room, driving out all the cold air. This method is very simple, but it is not that easy in reality. Naturally, it also consumes some electricity or fuel to maintain the circulation of the water, but the cost is half of the cost of burning coal. However, the water pipe leading underground needs to be almost a hundred feet deep to be effective, which is a bit difficult."

"Summer heat can be stored for use in winter. That's really interesting," Yonger said with a smile.

### Little Maxims

— Xin Fang

If you cry to someone, they say you have a bad temper. If you smile to someone, they say you have a good temper. Children, children, must remember, less crying, more smiling, healthy body.

The longer you hold sugar in your mouth, the longer the sweetness lasts. Reading is the same: the longer you read, the longer the taste of the book stays with you.

A child who truly reads with their heart will never be willing to soil the books at hand.

Older brother is older than me, so let older brother sit first. Younger brother is younger than me, so let younger brother eat first. In this way, I will be a good younger brother and a good older brother. (Recorded from Children's Magazine)

### My Childhood

— Yang Jinhao

Which child doesn't love to play? In childhood, one should also play games to enliven the spirit and strengthen the body. If one buries oneself in books all day long, desperately studying hard until the body becomes weak and the mind dull, wouldn't that be turning into an old man?

However, excessive playing can hinder proper activities. Wasting time like that is also inappropriate.

In my childhood, I loved playing too much and didn't study well enough. Looking back now, I really regret it a bit.

At that time, I was always gathering a few friends, fighting on empty fields, doing somersaults at graves, picking up bamboo poles to play with spears and sticks. Naturally, I often kicked shuttlecocks, bounced leather balls, and rolled iron hoops. When the coldest days came, we threw snowballs, built snowmen, and knocked on ice gongs. Sometimes we even took off our clothes and bared our chests to show that I was a hero. However, these games did train my body well. Therefore, even though I suffered several major illnesses when I grew up, I was able to overcome them.

I first attended a private school opened by a cousin, reading things like the "Three Character Classic," "Mencius," "Analects"... without understanding any of it. Later, my father took time out at home to lecture and teach some poor neighborhood children, but I still couldn't get into those old relics. My father was naturally lazy and didn't enjoy teaching for long, so he sent me to a small elementary school at the end of East Street. However, I felt depressed when I entered the school and often played truant.

At this time, I met some new friends who were studying at an elementary school in Henan. They said that studying there was very interesting and persuaded me to go there as well. I don't know if my understanding had finally opened up, but I suddenly made up my mind to study hard. I felt that I wasn't young anymore, and it was embarrassing to not have read much.

When school started, I joined the elementary school in Henan. After that, I never missed a class. Even if there were things to do at home, I would still go to school.

However, after class, we still played games. Often at night, we gathered many children, some carrying lanterns, some holding bamboo poles, lined up in a row, singing the national anthem, and circled a large area in the east and west ends of the city and in the north and south suburbs. The marching commands of "One! Two! Three! Four!" also echoed loudly. We were like patrolling at night, protecting our hometown, and guarding against sneak attacks by powerful enemies and thieves. Everyone's spirits were very uplifted and excited, which cultivated a sense of collective spirit among us children.

When I was young, I also liked to go to the countryside to sketch, plant flowers and plants in the garden, tie flower pots, build flower beds, and make sugar cakes. I also often stood alone on a water bridge to fish, or followed the maid to the fields to pick wild vegetables. These things, on one hand, were games for me, and on the other hand, were also labor. I really felt happy doing them. Now, I often treat labor as a game, so I don't feel bored doing it.

A year later, I went to another city to attend high school. I still spent a lot of time playing then. It wasn't until I entered middle school that I desperately read extracurricular books. Now, the fact that I can write articles is thanks to many extracurricular books.

Special Report from This Newspaper

### Ying Yin Returns

— Hua

Wu Xingzai Sends Telegram from Kunming Requesting Her to Star as Empress Dowager Cixi for Cooperative Production

In the New Year, I was eager to find some exciting news to share with readers. Luckily, I came across a great scoop yesterday and am reporting it to everyone now: Ying Yin has returned to Shanghai. I recall receiving a letter from a friend in Chongqing at the end of last year stating that Ying Yin was rumored to have disappeared. The original letter was vague, and Hong Kong newspapers also had some coverage on Ying Yin, but the reasons for her disappearance were all speculative and lacked concrete details. Who would have thought that Ying Yin, whose disappearance was widely reported in Chongqing, would actually appear on Avenue Joffre in the "Isolated Island" last night?

Since the disbandment of "Qingniao," Ying Yin went to the inland areas and eventually arrived in Chongqing, where she has been for almost two years. Her acting is known for being bold and lively. Her role as "Wu Zetian" in "Yeshi" was her claim to fame. In Chongqing, the wartime capital of the new China, talent like hers was needed in both film and theater, so her sudden disappearance quickly spread to Shanghai.

Now that I have unexpectedly encountered her, I naturally had to ask about the reason for her coming to Shanghai. In a hurried moment, she briefly told me:

After "Confucius," Minghua Company will be co-producing "Empress Dowager Cixi" with Hezhong. After countless auditions, they finally found a suitable actor, Tang Huaiqiu, who suddenly returned to play Confucius. So, for the role of Empress Dowager Cixi, they sought the opinions of colleagues from both companies in advance, hoping to decide soon to avoid a last-minute scramble. Wu Xingzai happened to be in Kunming, so they asked him to send a telegram to Chongqing to discuss the matter with Ying Yin. Because of the invitations from Fei Mu and others, Ying Yin agreed to come from afar to star in this "Empress Dowager Cixi." When Chongqing was rife with rumors of her disappearance, she was actually flying to Hong Kong. When Hong Kong newspapers were publishing various reports about her, she was waiting for Wu Xingzai to come from Kunming and return to Shanghai together.

She is temporarily staying at a friend's house, engaging in research to prepare for filming "Empress Dowager Cixi." Once "Confucius" is completed, "Empress Dowager Cixi" will begin filming.

### Ying Yin as Beautiful and Healthy as Ever

— Zhao

### Battle of Changsha

— Xingyan

"Battle of Changsha" is also known as Guan-Huang Face-Off. In the past, Wang Guifen and Tan Xinpei performed it in the inner court. Wang played Guan Yu, and Tan played Huang Zhong, with Li Lianzhong as Wei Yan. They were evenly matched and regarded as a masterpiece at the time. When Wang retired and Tan was in his later years, he always played the red-faced role himself and let Li's apprentice Rui Debao play Huang Zhong. This habit gave people the impression that the red-faced Guan Yu was the leading role and the older martial role was the supporting one, but this is not the case. Guan Yu and Huang Zhong are equally important in the play. If we take the execution ground scene, Huang's singing and acting are more complex, so Huang seems more important than Guan. In recent years, many bearded singers have come south, but there is no suitable candidate for the red-faced role (Lin Shusen rarely performs with Peking Opera actors), so this great play has disappeared from the stage, making fans long for it. This time, Xin Gengxin invited Tan-style bearded singer Guan Dayuan and Wang Hongshou (San Mazi)'s talented disciple Li Hongchun, and paired them with martial second female lead Liu Yanting, so "Battle of Changsha" could be performed again. I went to see it that day. Dayuan has a deep understanding of Tan's style, and his voice is especially suitable for high pitches, so the singing part can be said to be flawless. In particular, several inverted boards and the final Hui Long tune were even more brilliant. As for the style of wearing armor, his slightly shorter stature does not detract from its beauty. This is because he has been deeply involved since childhood. It is said that he was able to perform on stage at the age of twelve, so he is much better than the average Tan-style actor who started halfway. The most difficult part of the play is when Huang Zhong loses his horse (when Guan Gong uses the Dragging Saber trick), he must roll over and fall off his horse at the front of the stage with a "wave drum" (when rolling, his body is straight, like shaking a wave drum). This kind of skill cannot be easily attempted without years of practice, especially when holding a large knife and wearing a flag on his back. If he is not familiar with this, the knife will fly and the flag will break. Unexpectedly, Dayuan's roll was extremely stable, clean and beautiful. When he knelt up, his knife was lying across his face, as if placed there by an inspector. This one move alone is enough to overwhelm his peers. In recent years, there are not many actors who can perform plays with armor, let alone rolling a wave drum with a knife while wearing armor. Hongchun is limited by the large assignment, and his pitch differs from Dayuan by almost one and a half notes, but he worked very hard that day, and his poses were also very experienced. Yanting is good at playing supporting roles. Wei Yan, Zhang Fei, Meng Liang, and Niu Gao, etc., can best show his strengths, so he also won praise in the play that day. Dayuan is in his prime, and I hope he can perform more Tan plays with armor this time, so the audience's ears and eyes can be refreshed.

### Xin Yanqiu and Yu Zhenfei Expected to Arrive in Shanghai on the 10th

— Mr. Shutai

Xin Yanqiu, Yu Zhenfei, Guan Shengji, etc., departed from Pingfu Tangzhan on the Shuntian Wheel on the 5th of this month and are heading south. They are expected to arrive in Shanghai on the 10th and will perform in the renewal. Xin Ling is a direct disciple of Cheng Yushuang and has a deep understanding. She and Xue Yanqin can be called the brightest stars of their time. She has many plays, and all of Cheng's famous plays, such as "The Three Heroes of the Dust," "The Jasper Hairpin," "The Mandarin Duck Tomb," and "Wenji Returns to Han," are Xin Ling's specialties. Xin Ling also has a private wooden play, "Yujing Taoist" and "King Xiang Meets Yuji," which is different from Mei's famous play "Farewell My Concubine," and this decision will also be revealed in the first performance. Yu Zhenfei's young male roles are proficient in both Kunqu and mixed styles, and he is full of talent. He is a rare choice in the current young male role scene. This decision will be made with Xin Ling, which will definitely help to reflect the splendor of the flowers and leaves.

### Ernst Lubitsch Talks About the Stars of 1940

— Muyi

Ernst Lubitsch recently spoke at length with a reporter from Picture Play magazine, and his remarks about the new female stars of 1940 are very noteworthy. I have selected and translated them below.

The actresses needed on the screen in 1940 are not dummies. Stage experience is very important: the younger and more experienced the girl, the greater her chances of success.

Beauty is not the most important thing; only a few great stars are beautiful. But every famous actress has her own personality, attraction, and magic. The star of 1940 does not need to be very intelligent, but she cannot lack reason.

(Editor's note: Ernst Lubitsch's words are very insightful and can be used as a reference for filmmakers and film practitioners in our country. Especially the last two sentences, in the current environment in Shanghai, one can fully appreciate them.)

### Unofficial History of the Pear Garden

— Xu Muyun

Is Gui Junqing Still Alive?

I love watching Master Gui Er's court and military plays. I have watched his "Stealing the Imperial Records," "Assembly of Heroes," "Wang Zuo Cuts His Arm," etc., many times. They are truly worth watching over and over again. His "Selling the Horse and Requiring the Mace" is also worthy of being one of the best after Lao Tan. The style of the mace is different from that of Shuyan. Sun Zuochen once talked to me about it in Japan. He said that Lao Tan regarded the mace as a unique skill and never passed it on to others because he was a martial artist and he was a bad person. I am afraid that others would steal it, so he often changed the tricks of his mace every time. Lao Yuan had been with him for a long time, and he also liked martial arts (he had the nickname of Sun Lao with the spear), so he had a good understanding of Lao Tan's mace. He had also practiced a few times in my residence. Although Gui Er had not obtained the direct inheritance from Tan, when Lao Yuan accompanied him to play the Qin, he had also told Gui Er about the moves of Lao Tan's whirlwind. Naturally, it was not far from Lao Tan. Later, Xiao Yu's mace was probably what Lao Tan called "reducing the head and removing the tail" in his later years. Furthermore, You Chen, Jupeng, etc., were all self-taught and had not put in as much effort as Junqing, so they could only sing "Selling the Horse" but not the "Requiring" mace below. In short, the Tan-style plays that Gui Er knew were indeed very solid. As mentioned above, those few plays were not inferior to Shuyan. Perhaps there were even places where they were better than Xiao Yu's. Now I hear that he is still living in the Yantai and Harbin areas, and is very down on his luck. There are many wealthy amateur performers at sea. If they can find out about Gui Er's whereabouts and bring him to the south, they can really get a good Tan-style play. (170)

### Guilin City, Established on New Year's Day

— Gong Huai

Its Strategic Location Has Made It a Southwest National Defense Stronghold; Its Beautiful Scenery Still Retains a Spirited Life

Guilin is Guangxi's hub after the War of Resistance and the center of southwest culture and politics. Since Nanning fell, it has become an important military town. According to sources, the Guangxi Provincial Government has decided to change Guilin to a city on New Year's Day of the 29th year of the Republic of China and appoint Chen Enyuan as mayor. As for the original Guilin County, it has now been renamed Lingui County, and the county magistrate is still Tian Liangji. From then on, Guilin's position in national defense will become even more important.

A Glimpse of the City

Guilin's city walls are surrounded by rugged and verdant mountains, forming a very majestic landscape. The city's perimeter is twelve li, with twelve gates, including Wusheng, Ningyuan, Anding, and Lizhe in the east. The most bustling street is called Gongyuan Street, where stores selling Suzhou and Hangzhou foreign goods are concentrated. The city is still quite prosperous. Since Guangzhou and Wuhan fell one after another and Changsha was burned down by a fire, party and government officials and civilians who retreated from Hunan, Hubei, and Guangdong provinces poured into Guilin like a tide, almost bursting the small city of Guilin. At that time, all the houses were rented out, and the usually quiet city gradually became active. Streamlined cars crawled all over the streets, and the torrent of people surged back and forth. The decoration of the shops also became gorgeous, and the colorful goods in the city also appeared in the city of Guilin. It is now like a modern city. But, unfortunately, the Japanese planes repeatedly flew over Guilin, carrying out cruel bombings. As a result, one-third of the houses were destroyed. Countless innocent civilians were bombed to death. After each bombing, the streets were filled with rubble, coke, bomb craters, and scattered telephone lines, and the scorched street trees were filled with a desolate atmosphere. But on these scorched earth, in just a few days, new simple houses made of wooden boards or reed mats were filled. The power of this construction is something that everyone should admire.

Beautiful Scenery

"Guilin's scenery is the best in the world," as everyone says. Because the mountains in Guilin are very tall and beautiful; the water in Guilin (referring to the Guijiang River) is clear and lovely, like "filtered through a water filter." The most famous of these is Duxiu Peak, which stands tall in the city, 50 zhang high, and is not connected to the mountains outside the city. There are more than 300 stone steps on the mountain leading to the top. From here, you can see the entire city. Yan Yanzhi of the Song Dynasty once wrote the poem "Not as good as Duxiu, towering in the city" to sing about it. Therefore, Duxiu's reputation has become even more famous. The most famous scenic spots outside the city are Elephant Trunk Hill and Seven Star Cave. Elephant Trunk Hill is in the south of the city. The shape of the mountain is like an elephant raising its nose. There is a tower on it, which looks like a bottle from a distance. Below is the Water Moon Cave, which is a perfect circle and communicates with the back of the mountain. The river water enters and exits the cave, and it is clear and visible, looking like a bright moon from a distance. Seven Star Cave is outside the East Gate, deep and wide, making it the crown of the caves in Guilin. The cave is behind Qixia Temple. There is a stone at the entrance of the cave that looks like a carp. There is a deep pool on the left, which is said to be connected to the beach. The ground on the right is wet and slippery. If you are not careful, there is a danger of falling into the pool. The locals call it Motianling. You must light a torch in the cave to move forward. Inside are oddly shaped rocks everywhere. Some are like lions playing with balls, some are like crouching elephants, some are like the Xiangshan Buddha with palms together, and some are like the Maitreya Buddha with his mouth open. It takes twenty minutes to get out of the cave. In addition, there are also Fubo Mountain, Longyin Cave, Yongji Bridge, etc., which are also very famous. Due to space limitations, I can only omit them.

### A Study of the Zhuang People of Guangdong and Guangxi

— Xu Songshi

Recently, as the war situation in southern Guangdong has become tense, place names such as "Na Chen Xu" and "Na Xiao Xu" are often seen in the newspapers. Do readers know the meaning of these place names? Originally, these were place names of the Zhuang people of Guangdong and Guangxi. Na Chen is located in the northeast of Qin County, Guangdong. Na Xiao is located directly south of Yongning, Guangxi. The Zhuang people call fields "Na" and thatch "Xiao." Na Chen is Chenchu, and Na Xiao is Thatch Field. Don't you think these place names are very interesting?

In the southwestern corner of Guangdong, the former Qin Prefecture, and in the area around the Liujiang River in western Guangxi, there are still many Zhuang people. In eastern Yunnan and southwestern Guizhou, there are also Zhuang residents. The names of their smaller tribes vary from place to place. They are called Huai, Zhong, Ya, Mulao, or Tulao. Generally, they are all Zhuang. Even the Li people on Hainan Island, Guangdong, can be called Zhuang in a broad sense.

What kind of people are these Zhuang people? Readers must be eager to know. The character Zhuang was originally written as Zhuang, and its pronunciation is the same as Zhuang. The name Zhuang originally originated in the Song Dynasty. The author has been studying the ancient history of Lingnan for more than ten years. It has now been clearly proven that the Zhuang people were the original aborigines of Guangdong and Guangxi. The original aborigines of Guangdong and Guangxi were definitely not Yao, not to mention Miao. Even those in Guangdong and Guangxi who claim to be descendants of the Han from the Central Plains have a mixture of Zhuang blood in them.

These Zhuang are also the purest Han people in China today. Since the Eastern Jin Dynasty, the Han people of the Central Plains have mixed with the blood of the Huns, Turks, and Xianbei. We know that the word Han originated from the East and West Han Rivers, and the areas around the East and West Han Rivers were originally inhabited by Zhuang compatriots. The author has carefully studied the Zhuang language and knows that the Zhuang people call men Lehan, which means Son of Han. The Zhuang language is inverted, and Son of Han means Hanzi. The Zhuang people have always called themselves Hanzi, but the Han people in the Central Plains discriminated against them, which is a very unjust thing.

Undoubtedly, the Zhuang belong to the ancient Southern Han people. Since the Yellow Emperor defeated the Yan Emperor, most of the Zhuang people were assimilated by the Northern Han people. Those who lived in the southwest and were less assimilated became the so-called Zhuang people in later generations. The difference between Zhuang and Mandarin today is only equal to the different sounds of Qi, Chu, Han, and Wei during the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods. Shuowen Xiezi said, "After Confucius's death, the princes fought for power and did not obey the king. They hated the harm that ritual and music did to themselves and abandoned their harmony. They were divided into seven countries, with different languages and different languages." The author has repeatedly asked Zhuang friends about the meaning of Lehan. According to them, Le is Son, and Lehan is just a different form of the character Zi. What is so strange about the uniqueness of the Zhuang language?

The author has traveled to the Zhuang area many times. The most recent one was after the start of the war in South China. Starting from Guilin, I traveled all over northern and western Guizhou and the southwest of Guangdong Province. The purpose was to investigate the general historical relics of the Zhuang. In this great era, these Zhuang compatriots are excited and enterprising, which deeply moved me.

"What are the views of your Zhuang compatriots on the Chinese nation today?" The author asked a Zhuang township chief in Longsheng County, Guangxi. This Zhuang township chief, whose surname is, replied: "The Zhuang people are Han people. In Guangxi, there is not a single Zhuang person who is not a descendant of the Yellow Emperor. Because since Di Qing pacified the South during the Huangyou period of the Song Dynasty, hundreds of thousands of troops from the Central Plains stayed in the four borders of Guangxi and married Zhuang women. For ten years, the boundaries between the local and guest people have long been completely eliminated. We Zhuang people are not only descendants of the Han, but also descendants of the brave soldiers under the command of Di Xiang Wu Gong. The descendants of soldiers should have the spirit of soldiers. There are many Zhuang people in Long. This province is handling military service, and Longsheng District completed the procedures the earliest. The spirit of soldiers is fully demonstrated. This is the concept of our Zhuang compatriots towards the Chinese nation." These few words clearly show the greatness and excellence of the Zhuang compatriots.

### Zhuang Youth

Economic Common Sense

### Currency Settlement

— Zhu Yuanqing

Currency settlement is a product of foreign exchange and trade controls. The methods implemented in our country's foreign exchange control and trade regulation are fivefold: (1) prohibition of imports and a quota licensing system; (2) exemptions from taxes, surcharges, and insurance premiums as incentives for exports; (3) state control of trade in tea, bristles, tung oil, and minerals; (4) restrictions on withdrawals and remittances to prevent capital flight; and (5) centralized foreign exchange settlement for the re-export of native products. Currency settlement is the system within the fifth item, which is what I intend to elaborate on:

The "Foreign Exchange Application Procedure" was promulgated on March 12, 1938. At that time, exporters holding foreign exchange were willing to sell it on the black market for a higher price, but importers preferred to purchase it from the Central Bank because its legal exchange rate was more favorable. Under these circumstances, the national bank only sold official exchange rates and did not buy them. If it wanted to cover its positions, it would have to seek the black market, incurring significant losses due to the difference between the legal and black market prices. Therefore, in mid-June of the same year, export settlement regulations were successively promulgated. The purpose was to concentrate the foreign exchange generated by exporters' exports in the hands of the government. The regulations included four articles, the "Postal Parcel Foreign Exchange Settlement Method" and three supplementary methods for related precautions. The four regulations were the "Regulations on the Method for Merchants to Export Goods and Settle Foreign Exchange," "Types of Export Goods Subject to Foreign Exchange Settlement and Methods Thereof," "Precautions for Handling the Export of Goods and the Settlement of Foreign Exchange," and "Implementation Regulations for the Export of Goods and the Settlement of Foreign Exchange."

On July 2nd of this year, three articles of the "Measures for Claiming Foreign Exchange Settlement Difference" were promulgated, stipulating that exporters of goods who settle foreign exchange with the government may, based on the settlement documents, claim the difference between the legal price and the listed price of the Bank of Communications from the settling bank. This is to reduce the costs of merchants and encourage exports. It is found that there are currently three exchange rates in China: one is the legal price of 14.5 pence per yuan of the Central Bank, one is the actual price listed by the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications (recently 7 pence), and the third is the black market price (recently around 8.5 pence). The difference mentioned here refers to the difference between the legal price of 14.5 pence and the actual price listed by the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications. The statement, "the government will incur losses due to the difference between the legal price and the black market price," refers to the difference between the legal price and the black market price (the black market price in June last year was around 8 pence). However, since the "Rules for Applying for Foreign Exchange to Purchase Imported Goods" were promulgated on July 1st of this year, importers have been required to pay a balancing fee equal to the difference between the legal price and the price listed by the Bank of China. In short: Since the "Rules for Applying for Foreign Exchange" were promulgated, the government has been supplying foreign exchange at the Bank of Communications' exchange rate, and if it needs to cover its positions in the black market—between buying and selling—it can only suffer losses within the range between the Bank of Communications' price and the black market price.

Regarding the types of goods subject to currency settlement, the "Regulations on the Types of Export Goods Subject to Foreign Exchange Settlement and Methods Thereof" originally stipulated 24 types: tung oil, bristles, tea, mineral sands, cowhide, egg products, gallnuts, sheepskin, wool, medicinal materials, silk, straw hats, human hair, ramie, sausage casings, cotton, peanuts, sesame, tobacco, wood, bamboo, almonds, duck feathers, and animal hides. In January of this year, for the sake of benefiting merchants, the Ministry of Finance removed ten types from the 24 types, combining sheepskin and animal hides into a single category of leather goods. The goods subject to foreign exchange settlement were reduced to 13 types: tung oil, bristles, tea, minerals, leather, leather goods, gallnuts, medicinal materials, wool, silk, ramie, sausage casings, and feathers. At the end of September, the Ministry of Finance telegraphed the Zhejiang Customs: "Regardless of whether native products are suitable for export or not, foreign exchange settlement must be carried out before shipment is approved." As a result, the scope of goods subject to foreign exchange settlement has been further expanded.

From the perspective of the entire country, in addition to increasing foreign exchange reserves, currency settlement can also strengthen control over domestic exchange. Because the legal tender in the occupied areas is beyond the reach of the National Government's authority, it is impossible to effectively manage it and make it circulate in a way that benefits the national economy. Therefore, it interferes with domestic exchange, hoping to reduce the surplus floating capital in this area. The specific methods probably include raising premiums, encouraging the transfer of capital to the interior to participate in production and construction, raising discounts, setting quotas, and restricting remittances to the occupied areas. However, some merchants, firms, and financial institutions that value profit over righteousness offer better terms than official banks to attract remittances, indirectly profiting from exchange rate differences. This situation is mostly a type of settlement where "matched positions are equal." Except for being subject to the constraint of "matched positions being equal," it is completely free exchange, which contradicts the National Government's intervention policy. Articles 2 and 3 of the "Measures for Claiming Foreign Exchange Settlement Difference" promulgated in early July clearly stipulate that the legal tender obtained from foreign exchange settlement with the Bank of China and the legal tender obtained from claiming the difference shall be paid by the Bank of China in the interior. The intention is to force exporters to remit the legal tender obtained from exports to the interior through the Bank of China, so as to reduce the funds available to the above-mentioned profiteering institutions for free exchange with the interior. Therefore, currency settlement actually contains the effect of strengthening control over domestic exchange. Because the strengthening of control over domestic exchange can reduce the floating capital in the occupied areas.

### Two Famous Quotes

— Zhou

(1) Dr. Lewitt, Psychologist:

Correct thoughts and life, coupled with physical and mental exercise and development, will make your ingenious machine (referring to the human body) work harmoniously and without harm for you. You also have great abilities, which others rely on to achieve success and happiness; because your self-confidence is shaken, your life becomes abnormal, just like a short circuit in a battery, and the current dries up. These can all be corrected.

(2) At the beginning of life, the creator did not designate someone to be poor, someone to be rich, someone to fail, or someone to succeed; childhood training, environment, and companions have a great influence on the formation of good and bad habits. But these habits and trends can be changed. We are born into the world like a piece of clay, which can be carved into various shapes. Everything about us is not predetermined, but can be controlled by ourselves, so everyone "should understand" the importance of taking good care of oneself.

### Overview of the Beggar Shelter

— Fuyun

The beggar shelter in this city is run by the Salvation Army International. The shelter is located at the intersection of Avenue Paul Flat and Rue Mgr Favier in the French Concession and is attached to the Second Reception Center of the International Relief Committee. It occupies four thatched sheds, which are divided into offices, a director's office, a women's room, a workshop, a police station, and beggar dormitories. There are currently over 600 beggars, including 50 to 60 female beggars, ranging from old women in their fifties or sixties to little girls around ten years old. Most of these beggars are sent to the shelter after being arrested by the French Concession police. Some are also sent by charitable organizations. Christian churches such as Moore Memorial Church also send some from time to time. In the shelter, they are not called by name. Like the vagrant workhouses of the past, they are all called by number. Most of them are beggars who are wandering the streets without food or clothing. Regardless of gender, most are addicted to opium, heroin, morphine injections, and other drugs.

Daily Life: They get up at 6:00 AM every morning and wipe the large pot (the dough water is placed in a vat, with ten people standing around each vat, wiping it with ten towels). At 6:30 AM, they gather in the playground. The staff (referring to those who work in the shelter) eat porridge at this time. At 7:30 AM, they run. At 8:30 AM, they enter the shed, each preparing bowls and chopsticks (each person has two bowls and a pair of bamboo chopsticks issued by the shelter). At 9:00 AM, they eat porridge, eating as much as they can. After eating, they sunbathe in the open air. Except on cloudy and rainy days, they are absolutely prohibited from sitting or sleeping on their beds during the day. At 4:00 PM, they eat rice with vegetables or radish soup, or green vegetable soup. Pickled vegetables are distributed every three or four days to eat with the porridge. Every night at 7:00 PM, the clerk takes roll call in each shed. After roll call, they go to bed. Those addicted to drugs are given medicine by a female nurse in the shed at 3:00 PM every afternoon. In case of illness, they report to the section chief or the clerk, who takes medicine from the International First Reception Center to administer. Seriously ill or elderly people are transferred to the ward, where the ward section chief and a temporary worker take turns to care for them. In the event of death, the remains are dealt with by the Tongren Funeral Parlor. If they abide by the rules and remain quiet in the shelter for three months, they can be released, but only after completing the guarantor procedures; otherwise, they cannot go out freely.

Overview of Services: The shelter has a special police station, staffed by a group of police officers dispatched by the police station, who are stationed in the shelter to guard the gate and maintain order within the shelter. In addition, the International Second Reception Center selects refugees who are capable of working to serve as section chiefs, who are responsible for managing the gate, providing service, and other tasks. They receive 3 yuan per month for food expenses. Each shed has a section chief and a deputy section chief, as well as a clerk, who is responsible for managing clothing, bedding, personnel, and medicine in the shed. Temporary workers are also selected from the residents of the shed (those who work in the shelter without food money are called temporary workers), a dozen or so, who are responsible for carrying rice (the rice is cooked in the Second Reception Center), cleaning (sweeping), sanitation (removing feces), and also barbering and tailoring. These tasks are said to be performed by residents selected from the masses in the shelter.

Production Work: Young people and children over ten years old are selected, and they currently only do wicker basket work. The small ones are the size of mesh baskets, and the large ones are similar to millet baskets. These wicker baskets are sold to foreign firms for foreigners to use.

Clothing and Bedding Distribution: The clothes of the beggars who enter the shelter are all tattered. The shelter issues a set of gray cloth cotton-padded jackets and trousers. Two people share a quilt, which is made of black cloth inside and out. The beds are bunk beds arranged in upper and lower tiers, made of bamboo slats. The bed boards are also made of bamboo slats.

Management and Other Matters: Because most of the beggars in the shelter are unruly and have a dissolute lifestyle, management must be strict. In addition to the two Chinese policemen guarding the gate in shifts, there are policemen stationed at the corners of the walls and the toilet pits to prevent escapes. The prescribed daily routines must be strictly followed. For example, if they do not get up at 6:00 AM, they will have to eat "fried dough sticks" (two rattan strips twisted together like fried dough sticks), bound with iron wire on the outside. Breaking a rice bowl means eating bamboo shoot braised pork (being beaten with bamboo boards, knocking broken rice bowls, and having to endure ten hits of the bamboo board). Losing chopsticks results in ten strikes. Smoking is absolutely prohibited. When entering the shelter, everyone's body is thoroughly searched. If smoking is discovered in the shelter, they will be spanked forty times. These stubborn beggars, after being disciplined in the shelter for three months, have their habits greatly changed. This is also due to the management of the shelter.

### Characteristics of the Finnish People

— Yingdai

First of all, we want to point out that the Finnish people are all able to endure hardship, tolerate hard work, and have a sense of unity. Therefore, in this war against the Soviet Union, their soldiers are able to fight bravely. Facts tell us that in modern warfare, the superiority of weapons alone is not enough. Finland's ability to resist strongly this time is due to its advantageous terrain as a major reason, but human factors are also the main factor.

It is said that the Finnish people were originally of Mongoloid stock. Before the 13th century AD, they migrated to Finland and have lived there ever since. Located in Northern Europe, the weather is cold, so due to geographical reasons, they have developed a strong physique and a spirit of hard work. Until 1809, they were ruled by Sweden for almost five centuries. From 1809 to 1917, Finland was part of Russia. Although it was autonomous, the Finnish people had a hostile attitude towards Russia at that time. On October 7, 1917, it became independent and established a new republic.

It has only been 20 years since then. However, in the past 20 years, because the Finnish people have been able to cooperate and operate diligently, they have built everything in Finland very well in a very short period of time, and it is like a brand-new country.

Education in Finland is also very developed. Schools are widely available throughout the country, so the number of illiterates among the people is also very low. Moreover, they have been able to implement democratic policies. Women have long been granted the right to vote and, like men, have the right to vote at the age of 21. Whether in law or education, men and women are equal. The Finnish people also pay great attention to sports, especially in long-distance running, where they have had many outstanding talents. To this day, they still hold many world records in long-distance running. Therefore, one of the reasons why the Finnish people have a strong physique, are able to endure hardship, and love sports in peacetime is that they practice sports!

Finland's lakes and swamps! Finland has many lakes and swamps, which are natural fortifications. Due to the climate and geography, it is extremely difficult for the Soviet Union to attack.

### Hitler's Sister

— Shijie

The world-famous Hitler has a younger sister living in Vienna, Austria. She originally worked in an insurance company writing envelopes, and her monthly salary was barely enough to live on. After it was discovered that she was the sister of the leader of the National Socialist Party, she lost her job. Later, no business dared to hire her again. Therefore, she had to rely on Hitler's allowance to live. But she was often distressed by relying on others for a living. She often told her friends that her greatest happiness would be to be able to support herself one day.

Her current life is extremely simple. The rent for her house is only 14 yuan per month. She does not hire a servant at home and handles all the housework herself. Although she uses her real name to register, her neighbors only know her as Mrs. Wolf. The reason she wants to hide from them is to avoid being pestered by uninvited guests. A newspaper that did not know what was good for it exposed her secret, so visitors came in an endless stream, and she had no choice but to take refuge in a friend's house. She also received countless letters; some asked her to intervene in her brother's behavior on behalf of the letter writers, some were full of flattery, and some were full of abuse. She hated both of these types of letters.

Miss Paula Hitler loves to live quietly, rarely chats with her neighbors, and only receives a few friends on weekdays. She goes to Germany once a year and spends a few weeks with her brother.

Scientific Anecdotes

### Surprising Weight

— Guan

It is a good deal for Ningbo people to come to Shanghai to do business. For example, a boatload of salted crabs or fresh ribbonfish is transported from Ningbo to Shanghai. Regardless of how much interest they charge, just in terms of weight alone, it has already increased a little. But this is not because the scales used are different.

It turns out that objects only have weight because of the earth's gravity. The closer to the earth's center, the more gravity is received, and the heavier the object is. Weighing something on a high mountain is lighter than weighing it on the ground. This has been tested many times. Now our earth is not "perfectly round." The equator is more bulging, and the two poles are closer to the earth's center. At the same time, the earth rotates day and night without rest. All the moving plants, animals, and minerals on its surface would have been thrown into outer space by its "centrifugal force" if there were no gravity. Therefore, "centrifugal force" offsets a part of the weight, and this centrifugal force is particularly strong on the equator. For the above two reasons, something weighing 1,000 pounds at the poles will only weigh 995 pounds when carried to the equator with the original scale. If it is carried back to the poles, 1,000 pounds is the exact weight.

Therefore, the closer an object on the equator moves north or south, the heavier it becomes, until it reaches the North Pole or the South Pole. Shanghai is north of Ningbo, so the goods from Ningbo should theoretically be a little heavier in Shanghai. For example, Paris and Chicago are not very far apart in the north-south direction. Something weighing 2,000 pounds in Paris only weighs 1,998 pounds when weighed in Chicago. However, it is not necessary to calculate a salted crab or a fresh ribbonfish. One boatload, ten boatloads, a hundred boatloads... will naturally fluctuate a little, but in any case, the Ningbo merchants did not include these benefits in their calculations.

The above is just talking about the earth. If we talk about the stars, it is even more surprising. Recently, astronomers discovered a white dwarf star. It is said that on that planet, a cubic inch of ordinary material weighs 9,000 tons. On Earth, platinum is considered to have a relatively large specific gravity, but a cubic inch is only a little over two pounds.

### Notes on Small Knowledge

Some American students conducted such an experiment! They gathered ten beautiful and strong female shop assistants, asked them to wear rubber gloves, and each took a sterilized basin and kissed the edge of the basin once. Then they immediately analyzed it, and the result was that each kiss left 20 to 550 bacteria. They also tested lipstick in the same way, proving that lipstick is a place for bacteria to breed.

The largest movie theater in the world is in Moscow. It is a park covering two acres that can accommodate more than 20,000 spectators. The screen is 500 square feet in size, and the projector's light intensity is one million candles.

In Los Angeles, USA, there are certain people who specialize in repairing car lights. If they find a car with a broken light at night, they will ride a motorcycle or bicycle to catch up and tell them, "A light on your car is broken, and the police will fine you. Fix it quickly!" It costs half a dollar each time, and the average weekly income is 250 yuan, because on average, one out of forty cars has a broken light.

The Hungarian capital has a radio station with an antenna 297 feet high and weighing 580 tons, capable of generating 120 kilowatts. It is placed on a porcelain insulator. This porcelain insulator is circular, with a diameter of three feet, but its thickest part is only three feet.
