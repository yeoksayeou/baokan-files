Resolutions of the Ninth Session

Chongqing: The main points of the resolutions from the ninth meeting are as follows:

(1) The main points of the resolutions regarding the education report are as follows: (1) The number of students studying abroad, regardless of whether they are funded by the British Boxer Indemnity Scholarship, the Sino-American Boxer Indemnity Scholarship, or the Gengzi Indemnity, should not be increased. This is because the cost of studying abroad is much higher than that of domestic students. At this time of economic difficulty, priority should be given to strengthening domestic schools at all levels and expanding the number of students. The existing research institutes in various universities have also been restored, so increasing the number of students studying abroad can be slowed down. (2) Vocational and technical schools aim to train middle- and lower-level technicians and skilled workers, which meets the needs of resisting the war and building the nation. These schools should be gradually increased, and universities that already have agricultural and engineering colleges should establish vocational and technical departments to expand training. (3) It is hoped that the Women's Normal College, approved by the Fourth Session, can be established in the autumn of this year, and it is hoped that the location can take into account the needs of the environment. (4) Attention should be paid to improving the general situation of teachers' service groups and national high schools. (5) Improving the salaries of primary school teachers still requires practical implementation. Educational administrative authorities in each province and city should be urged to handle this matter seriously. (6) Due to the current high cost of living, it is difficult for middle-class families to afford their children's education. Schools at all levels should be notified to pay attention to reducing the economic burden on students as much as possible, such as not requiring overly formal or uniform uniforms. (7) Currently, schools in general do not pay much attention to the physical health of students, or only focus on competitions in academics and other extracurricular activities, without considering the students' ability to bear the burden, or providing meager meals with insufficient nutrition, and inadequate medical facilities. This has a great impact on the future of the nation and should be given serious attention and improved. (8) For overseas Chinese children returning to China to study, in order to facilitate their familiarity with the national situation, it is advisable to have them enroll in existing schools. If they have language difficulties, temporary remedial classes can be established. (9) Vocational schools should pay attention to establishing more night schools and other remedial classes to provide opportunities for workers to study. (10) There are a large number of disabled soldiers. The First Session of this council had a resolution on providing vocational education for disabled soldiers, which should be given attention and actively promoted. (11) Some high schools have independently changed curriculum standards, which has a great impact on the future of students and also damages the dignity of educational laws and regulations. The government should pay attention to correcting this. (2) The proposal by Councilor Zhang Shenfu and 21 others, to protect academic freedom in order to develop scholarship and promote social progress, was resolved as follows: The progress of the nation and society depends on the development of scholarship and culture, and the development of scholarship and culture depends on the emergence of new and different ideas, and the emergence of new and different ideas depends on freedom of thought and freedom of speech. Therefore, modern progressive countries rarely fail to value freedom of thought and freedom of speech. It is proposed that the government issue a notice to the whole country to protect freedom of speech and academic research under the supreme principles of the Three Principles of the People and the Outline for Resistance and Nation-Building. (3) The proposal by Councilor Jiang Hengyuan and 24 others, that the price of textbooks has increased sharply and sources are scarce, urgently requiring a rescue plan, was resolved to be amended and passed. (4) The proposal by Councilor Ou Yuanhuai and 22 others, to establish a Southwestern Vocational and Technical School to facilitate construction, was resolved to be passed. (5) The proposal by Councilor Lufei Bohong and 20 others, to improve national language education, was resolved to be sent to the government for reference. (6) The proposal by Councilor Liu Hengjing and 22 others, to request the government to increase the salaries of primary and secondary school teachers in order to maintain the education cause, was resolved to be passed and sent to the government for practical handling. (Temporary Motions) (1) The temporary motion by Councilor Qin Wangshan and 45 others, to request the government to formulate preferential treatment for overseas Chinese who have worked hard to save the country and have been forced to return, and to have the government designate a special agency to handle overseas Chinese affairs, to quickly investigate and register overseas Chinese who have been forced to return due to patriotic work, and to employ them according to their talents and arrange for them separately, and to give appropriate titles as honorary awards to those who have a considerable status in the overseas Chinese community and do not need government support, was resolved to be passed. (2) The temporary motion by Councilor Li Hongwen and 45 others, to propose that the central government quickly allocate large sums of money to provide disaster relief to the people of Shanxi Province to facilitate the war effort, was resolved to be passed. (3) The temporary motion by Councilor Huang Jianzhong and 43 others, that the disaster situation in Hubei is severe, and proposing that the government quickly allocate large sums of money for disaster relief, was resolved to be passed. (4) The temporary motion by Councilor Luo Lixue and 48 others, requesting the government to quickly allocate large sums of money to provide disaster relief to the people of Lanzhou, was resolved to be passed. (10th dispatch)

Speaker Chiang's Closing Remarks

Chongqing: At the closing ceremony of the Fifth Session of the National Political Council, Speaker Chiang delivered his closing remarks. The main points are as follows: Speaker Chiang first expressed his satisfaction with this session, saying that this session was particularly spirited, and that all the proposals were more practical and appropriate than previous sessions, which was enough to inspire the military and civilians of the whole country. The council is a collection of talented and virtuous people from all over the country. The more the session is held, the more prosperous and progressive it becomes, just like our army is becoming stronger and stronger as it fights. The council's review reports and proposals are all practical and feasible, and the government will definitely fully accept them and implement them solemnly. He hoped that everyone would supervise and that the people would work together to implement them. He then described the contributions of the National Political Council over the past two years, the greatest of which are two: (1) Realizing sincere unity. Since the establishment of this council, the whole country, from top to bottom, has been able to unite sincerely and truly achieve concentrated will, unified action, sharing life and death, and sharing weal and woe. Due to the establishment of this council, the will of the government and the people has been closely connected, and the virtuous and outstanding talents of the whole country have been loyal and sincere, and have fought together. (2) Supporting the national policy of resistance. The council has made solemn expressions of support for the major plan of resistance to the war at each of its meetings. Our established national policy of resistance over the past two years has been consistently implemented and has not wavered. Only a very small number of people who could not persevere have abandoned themselves and left. (3) Establishing a model of civil governance. The council has completely eliminated the malpractices of past parliaments over the past two years. Everything is open and honest, and there is absolutely no acting on impulse. The biggest bad habit of Chinese scholar-officials from the Han and Tang dynasties to the Song and Ming dynasties was to indulge in their own impulses and sacrifice national interests. Our current situation is completely different. Now, as long as we mention the nation, the ethnicity, and the war of resistance, all personal opinions can be completely sacrificed. This point alone proves that we can become a modern country and hold endless hope for the future of the country.

Finally, Speaker Chiang especially pointed out the three major points that this session focused on, which are (1) Punishing the Japanese puppets, (2) Developing the economy, and (3) Implementing constitutional government. He gave a comprehensive account of each section and explained his personal opinions and expectations. (1) Punishing the Japanese puppets: The unanimous telegram passed on the first day of the session expressed the solemn public opinion of our entire nation. Several words in the telegram exposed the deception and conspiracy of the Japanese puppet organization, which is of great significance to the war of resistance. Looking at past history, we are not afraid of national weakness, but we are afraid of not distinguishing between right and wrong. The fall of dynasties in the past was not only due to scholar-officials valuing impulse and losing integrity, but also because the general society was confused about right and wrong, and did not distinguish between black and white. As a result, people were numb and unconsciously fell into ruin. When I read the history of the past and saw the Jin soldiers crossing the river, saying that there was no one in the Southern Dynasty, I felt that this sentence was the most alarming. It was not that there was no one in the Southern Dynasty, but that the righteous spirit had declined and justice had been lost. Therefore, people were not considered people, and the enemy dared to invade. Therefore, the most important thing is to promote the national righteousness and publicize national justice, to clarify the meaning of the Spring and Autumn Annals, and to strictly distinguish between Xia and Yi. Now, the puppet organization regards the destruction of the country as a peaceful delusion, reversing black and white and shaking people's hearts. Therefore, the greatest contribution of this council is to distinguish between right and wrong. As long as the righteous spirit exists and justice is upheld, no enemy will ever be able to destroy China. This time, the council's expression is enough to deter the enemy in spirit and make the treacherous lose their souls. The greatness of the spiritual power of the Chinese people now will never be recognized by the Japanese warlords. The Japanese only know how to study the history of the late Ming Dynasty, but they do not know the history of the founding of the Republic of China at all. They do not know how the Qing Dynasty was overthrown, how the Republic of China was established, and even more so, they do not think about the spirit of our Chinese era and the power of the Three Principles of the People. Now, they are sending Abe to be a disguised Korean Governor-General. Such aggression and insult will inevitably stimulate our extraordinarily strong national consciousness. The more rampant and cunning the Japanese warlords are, the closer the future of our revolutionary victory is. (2) Developing the economy: The colleagues of this council are most concerned about the economy during the war of resistance. Whether it is reviewing reports or discussing proposals, they are particularly fresh about the economic aspects, which is very gratifying. But I have a few opinions that I want to say in passing, that is, China's economy cannot be viewed in the same way as other countries. The wartime economy is originally more and more difficult the longer it lasts. But now that China's war of resistance has been going on for nearly three years, it is not easy for us to be able to support it until now without a foundation. It is also because we have a vast land, abundant resources, and a large population. As long as the people's life of food, clothing, and housing is properly regulated and controlled, and production is developed in a proper manner, there will be no problems. Therefore, I am indeed very optimistic about the future of the wartime economy. Of course, the points that everyone is worried about are worthy of constant vigilance. But as long as we follow our established plan and the proposals of the conference, and the government and the people work together, I can say that not only can we support it, but even if the situation becomes more difficult, we will definitely be able to regenerate ourselves. The key now is that personnel have not yet been exhausted. In the future, we must follow the actual situation and do it in a practical way. Here, I want to especially remind everyone and the general public to be able to endure pain and hardship in particular. We must expect that there will be ten or twenty times more difficult days in the future, and we must be determined to endure hardship to shoulder this difficulty and overcome this difficulty. We must work hard to produce, we must conserve consumption, and we must also improve all economic methods. The government must be more responsible, and the people must be more diligent and persistent. We must take the partial peace and laziness after the Southern Song Dynasty as a warning. We must especially talk about integrity and responsibility, and do not let the sacrifices of the soldiers and the suffering of the compatriots be turned into nothing. Therefore, corruption must be punished and negligence must be abandoned. In short, being able to endure pain and hardship will surely achieve the goal of winning the war of resistance.

(3) Implementing constitutional government: At this meeting, everyone enthusiastically discussed constitutional government. Although a satisfactory conclusion has not yet been reached due to time constraints, our colleagues can still contribute their opinions after the meeting. The council will send the draft of the Constitutional Government Preparation Committee and everyone's opinions to the government, awaiting the final decision of the National Assembly. My personal opinion is that the matter of constitution-making must be completely planned for the long-term interests of the country, and we must learn from the painful lessons and experiences of the past, so as to lay a good foundation for the future implementation of the constitution and truly create welfare for the people. Therefore, we must not only pay attention to the history and national conditions of the past, and pay attention to the current facts and environment, but also take into account the future after the constitution is promulgated and implemented. We must know that China's current task is to achieve national independence, freedom, and equality, and the implementation of this task requires ten or twenty years of labor. Especially important, I believe that the spirit of the Five-Power Constitution must not be violated. Since we want to build China into a Republic of the Three Principles of the People, there cannot be clauses in the constitution that violate the Five-Power Constitution. If we believe that there are things that cannot be done for a while, but should be gradually enriched and gradually improved, there is of course a temporary expedient power, but it must not be stipulated within the constitution. I believe that our constitutional draft must be flexible and require that every article be practical. Finally, Speaker Chiang summarized the entire article and expressed his gratitude for the efforts of all councilors. He also especially hoped that everyone would attach importance to practice and not deviate from reality, because saving the country is a difficult and arduous task. Not only are we physically suffering, but our hearts are also suffering. Our country has not yet achieved an independent and equal position, the enemy has not yet been driven out, the nation has not yet been built, the people are still in pain, and the country is still suffering humiliation. We must not be careless, we must not forget the realistic pain of the country, and we must be down-to-earth in everything, endure hardship and hard work, and unite to do our utmost sincerity and effort. We must think about what kind of phenomenon the Japanese are trying to create by delusionally insulting us, breaking us up, and slackening us. Therefore, all colleagues must lead the people and save the country with a spirit of seeking truth from facts. Recalling the experience of weathering the storm together and helping each other in times of adversity over the past two years, I especially hope that all colleagues will do their best for the country, be candid friends to each other, and work together to achieve our sacred mission.

Editorial

### The Expansion of the European War and the Far East

The three Scandinavian countries, Sweden, Norway, and Finland, have always been known for their love of freedom. Their economies and cultures are highly developed, but because they are small and weak, they have always avoided all kinds of European disputes, trying to stay out of them, as was the case until the recent Soviet-Finnish War. This European war suddenly turned from a stalemate to an expansion, and the first to bear the brunt were Denmark and Norway. Denmark is located across the sea from the Scandinavian Peninsula, and it and Norway have now become important battlefields in the European war, which is truly lamentable and deserving of sympathy. This trend of expansion of the European war, whether from the perspective of the welfare of the whole world or from the perspective of the development of human history, is a great misfortune. However, from the perspective of the belligerent countries themselves, rather than a long stalemate, becoming a chronic disease, and ultimately inevitably using national fortune as a single bet, it is better to quickly seek a decisive battle of the main forces and determine the outcome as soon as possible. If the result of this expansion of the war accelerates the collapse of countries that aggressively wage war, and lays a fair and lasting true peace as soon as possible, then even if Denmark and Norway are sacrificed on the altar this time, they will still be beneficial to the welfare of the world and human civilization.

At present, the European war has reached its second stage, and it is still difficult to make a sudden judgment on how its future will gradually develop, but the kind of behavior that disregards international law and wantonly bullies the weak will inevitably arouse the condemnation and anger of the whole world, and will eventually be subject to the final sanction of fairness and justice. We firmly believe that the realization of the final sanction is only a matter of time; and from today to the day of realization, although it is difficult to predict the distance of time, the existence of phenomena awaiting sanction in the Far East has now been three years. We firmly believe that the final sanctions that the world is brewing and promoting in tangible and intangible ways will inevitably confirm the double importance of realizing the final sanctions due to the needs of both Northern Europe and the Far East.

The expansion of the European war is probably seen by the Japanese warlords as a development worthy of joy. Because Britain's strength is even more constrained by the Northern European battle situation, its position in the Far East will naturally be diminished; Japan, on the other hand, will be able to increase its international weight as a result. In fact, how much influence can be gained and lost, and the impact on the final result, be gained? Schadenfreude is just useless self-consolation. Let us consider: if Japan had not been trapped in the quagmire of the war of resistance by China for more than thirty months, then Japan's harvest in this European war would have long surpassed that of five years ago. If the Soviet-Finnish War had not ended in a truce a month ago, then now would be a good time for Japan to extort from all the belligerent countries. If so, then the Far East would be dominated by Japan, and Japan's international weight would almost be able to compete with the United States. But the reality is not so. Now, on the one hand, Japan is trapped in the increasingly deep invasion of China, unable to get rid of it, not only losing the good opportunity to seize special economic and political interests, but also because of its declining strength and weakening national power, it is no longer as worthy of attention as it was in the previous European war; on the other hand, although Britain and France are focusing all their efforts on dealing with the European situation and have no time to take care of the Far East, there are still the Soviet Union and the United States outside the European war, which will always be the main forces for stabilizing the Far East together with China in the war of resistance. Therefore, although the European war has spread outwards, Japan's importance in the international arena, although relatively increased compared to Britain and France, is still not enough to save Japan's decline, that is, it cannot reap the benefits of the fisherman.

Regarding China's national policy of resistance, the authorities have repeatedly stated that they will not be affected by any international changes; and the expansion of the European war has made China's government and people feel that they are not alone, and has further stimulated their determination to resist aggression. Not only that, but China's government and people will inevitably strengthen their feeling that China's war of resistance has now significantly had an international significance; in other words, after the expansion of the European war, China is not only sharing important responsibilities for the welfare of the world and human civilization through the war of resistance, but will also provide important contributions through the war of resistance. On the other hand, the seriousness of the European situation and the expansion of the European war have no adverse impact on China's war of resistance. For example, the military supplies that China obtains from Britain and France have always been very, very small, almost equal to zero; moreover, China already has a large amount of storage, and the self-manufacturing and self-sufficiency plan has also been implemented step by step, making rapid progress and achieving outstanding achievements; the international routes in the northwest and southwest have not been blocked. As for the economic situation, the demand of the belligerent countries for China's various native products and military raw materials will tend to be more eager, which is indirectly increasing China's material strength in the war of resistance.

The attitudes of the United States and the Soviet Union towards the new stage of the European war are of course related to the current situation in the Far East. But from the current situation, the United States and the Soviet Union not only show no signs of being dragged into the whirlpool of war, but also understand that the national policies of the two countries are to plan to avoid being dragged into the whirlpool. The US national policy has always been calm and firm, and it is extremely concerned about the European situation and deeply hates aggressive countries; its aversion to war, whether it is the government, the people, or the parties in and out of power, has been consistent until now; unless special events occur, this emotion will not change. As for the Soviet Union, its situation is far more complex than that of the United States, and the expansion of the war this time happened to occur in Scandinavia and the entrance to the Baltic Sea, which are closely related to the Soviet Union's own interests. But the Soviet Union has its own unique position and traditional national policy and will not do the foolish thing of pulling chestnuts out of the fire. Although the Soviet Union's attitude is currently more inclined towards Germany and has repeatedly criticized Britain and France, the Soviet Union's assistance to Germany has a certain limit and has not taken hostile actions against Britain and France. The British government's attitude towards the Soviet Union has recently become much more relaxed than it was a month ago, so as long as the Northern European war does not spread to the Soviet border, the Soviet Union is unlikely to participate in the war. Therefore, under the phenomenon of the expansion of the European war, all the factors related to the Far Eastern situation show that there is no change at all; and the way to stabilize the Far East and create the Far East is still for China to move towards the victory of the war of resistance!

### Japanese Spokesperson Claims the Pearl River Will Be Opened

Tokyo: A Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson, while meeting with reporters today, stated that the Pearl River will be reopened in the near future. However, the term "reopened" is not appropriate, as the river has already been reopened for navigation and trade, except for certain restrictions. Therefore, "removing these restrictions" is the more appropriate term. He hopes that this will be announced soon. Local Japanese authorities are also taking steps to accelerate the reopening of the Yangtze River. (Reuters, 10th dispatch)

### Japanese Fiscal Budget Heavily Criticized - Government Plans to Develop Industry and Agriculture

Tokyo: After the Japanese House of Representatives passed the massive fiscal budget for this year, it has been heavily criticized by various parties. In light of this, the government plans to compile a separate material budget to make up for its shortcomings. In essence, the government plans to massively develop domestic industrial and agricultural production, striving to enable Japan and its East Asian partners to achieve self-sufficiency. However, this material budget has not yet been submitted to the Diet, as the authorities believe that publishing the export indices of industry and agriculture for this year would be tantamount to exposing the country's strength and future plans to enemy countries and the entire world. Therefore, all news regarding production plans are treated as military secrets. However, according to reports in various local newspapers, this material budget is unlikely to be established before May of this year. At this time, it is necessary to thoroughly revise the plan formulated in 1939 and then use it to create the entire procedure as part of a large-scale production development plan. According to the Miyako Shimbun, the 1939 material mobilization plan originally included coal, iron, light metals, rubber juice, wool, and other items. Now, it is planned to expand the scope to include other major items such as rice, wheat, various major foods, synthetic gasoline, rubber, and specialized machinery and tools. When implementing the new plan, the government will naturally tighten controls. The coal production plan and several other special programs that have already been approved by the House of Representatives will also be included in the new plan to complement the price adjustment policy. As for the Price Adjustment Committee, it is being organized and will determine appropriate prices for various daily necessities. At the same time, a plan will also be established to include North China, Inner Mongolia, and Manchukuo, so as to provide appropriate coordination and adjustment to the economic development plans of each region.

The entire assembly unanimously approved this declaration. (Reuters, 10th dispatch)

Stockholm: News from here last night reported that Norwegian troops had defended the defensive line from Oslo to Hamar. Norway is confident that it has resisted the German advance until national mobilization is completed. (Associated Press, 10th dispatch)

Berlin: According to authoritative sources in the Nazi Party, German troops have occupied Hamar today. This location is north of Oslo, where the Norwegian government was based after retreating from the capital. (Associated Press, 10th dispatch)

Berlin: The German High Command recently stated that bases of military importance in Norway are now in German hands. German troops have firmly occupied Oslo, Trondheim, Bergen, Narvik, Stavanger, and Kristiansand. The serious resistance encountered by German troops in Oslo and Kristiansand has been crushed. Coastal batteries are now preparing to repel any enemy attacks. (Reuters, 10th dispatch)

Stockholm: It is reported that British aircraft were operating yesterday over Moss on the east bank of the Oslofjord. Norwegian troops were still resisting German forces in several locations last night, but the area near Oslo was quite calm. It is reported that the Germans have laid mines from Lillesand on the southern tip of Norway to Skagen, so the Skagerrak Strait has been blocked. According to news from Gothenburg, German minelaying vessels worked tirelessly all day in the Skagerrak Bay. (Reuters, 10th dispatch)

Stockholm: It is rumored that the Oscarsborg Fortress at the entrance to the Oslofjord fought all day yesterday. Last night, it was still bombarding the invading German forces.

Several people were injured when Kjeller Airfield outside Oslo was attacked. (Reuters, 10th dispatch)

London: Norwegian sources here recently stated that only a few dozen German troops landed in Norwegian ports. Their main force has been unable to continue arriving due to the intervention of British and French warships. Even among those who have landed, a portion of them came from Murmansk in the Soviet Union. Alternatively, several German transport ships carrying troops arrived in Norwegian territorial waters before the British and French fleets laid mines, preparing to land at predetermined locations. In short, there is no doubt that this German action was meticulously prepared before the British and French decided to lay mines. As for Norway's strength, the northern part currently has a division of the army stationed there, totaling 25,000 officers and men, while Trondheim Port in the central part has a division of 12,000 officers and men, both equipped with new weapons. The country has no fewer than 200,000 troops. In addition, the seventh joint meeting of the Supreme Defence Committee of Great Britain and France has decided to provide assistance. It is believed that it will be able to cope with the current situation with ease. (Havas, 9th dispatch)

When German troops entered Denmark and landed in the country, no unexpected incidents occurred. As for the Norwegian coast, the only resistance worth mentioning was seen in Oslo. However, in the afternoon, German troops crushed the resistance and occupied Oslo. (Reuters, 10th dispatch)

### Under German Military Control, a Norwegian "New Government" Appears - Danish Government Also Forced to Reorganize

Berlin: German Radio reports that General Kaupisch, the German Commander-in-Chief in Denmark, broadcast to the Danish people today, stating that German troops will pay attention to preventing even one Englishman from appearing in Norway and Denmark. Churchill, the greatest troublemaker of this century, is preparing to strike the Danish and Norwegian coasts. The Danish and Norwegian governments are neither willing nor able to effectively resist British aggression. The German High Command is now in contact with the Danish government to establish an agreement to maintain the freedom of the Danish people and the future independence of Denmark. General Falkenhorst, the German Commander-in-Chief in Norway, also broadcast the same remarks to the Norwegian people. (Reuters, 9th dispatch)

The Hague: It is reported that Germany has established a "puppet government similar to the Finnish government of Kuusinen" in Norway, led by members of the Norwegian Nazi Party. (Havas, 9th dispatch)

Oslo: Members of the Norwegian National Movement established a "new government" here last night. The list is as follows:

Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Quisling, Minister of Defense Wustrau, Minister of Social Affairs Riidnter, Minister of Justice Lie, Minister of Labor Stangke.

Note: "New Prime Minister" Quisling is the founder of the Norwegian Nationalist Party. During the European War, Quisling served as a secretary in Nansen's expedition team. In 1932, Quisling served as the Norwegian Minister of Defense, but later resigned due to political disagreements. (Haitong, 10th dispatch)

Berlin: According to a dispatch from Oslo, the so-called Norwegian "new government" was established last night. Using the Oslo radio station controlled by the Germans, a message to the Norwegian people was broadcast, with Quisling speaking as the leader of the new government, accusing Britain of laying mines in Norwegian territorial waters, thereby destroying Norwegian neutrality. He also said that the Norwegian government has resigned, and is now replaced by a national coalition government to protect Norwegian interests, hoping that the people will work together to escape the current crisis. (Reuters, 10th dispatch)

Copenhagen: Denmark established a coalition government last night, with three representatives each from the opposition Conservative Party and the Farmers' Party participating in the new government.

Stauning also briefly described the current situation, saying that he firmly believes that the government's decision has enabled the people of Denmark to avoid the scourge of war. He called on all national troops to cooperate sincerely. (Haitong, 10th dispatch)

### Rumor That Norwegian Government is Preparing to Negotiate with Germany

London: According to Stockholm radio, the Norwegian Parliament today passed a resolution to send four representatives to negotiate a "peace with honor" with the German authorities. Before the Parliament meeting, the Norwegian Ministry of Defense held a meeting to decide on the selection of four representatives. After accepting the proposal to send representatives, Norwegian Speaker of the Upper House Hambro adjourned the parliament temporarily. In this special meeting, Speaker Hambro only gave a brief speech, ending with "God save our country." (Associated Press, 10th dispatch)

London: Norwegian sources here have no knowledge of the claim that Germany has begun negotiations with the Norwegian government, saying that it may be a false report of Germany conducting negotiations with the Norwegian puppet government (organized by Norwegian Nazi Party leader Quisling). (Havas, 10th dispatch)

London: Neither the Norwegian embassy nor the British Foreign Office have received confirmed information regarding Norway's agreement to negotiate with Germany. A British spokesman said that all news coming from sources under German control is unreliable. As long as Oslo is in German hands, news coming from the so-called Norwegian side is as unreliable as that coming from the Berlin propaganda department. (Reuters, 10th dispatch)

### Peaceful Country Actually Trampled - The Painful Words of the Danish Prime Minister

London: According to a radio broadcast from Copenhagen, Danish Prime Minister Thorvald Stauning stated in Parliament last night that Denmark has always regarded not interfering in major foreign affairs as its policy, but he was very worried when he suddenly received the news at night that German troops had crossed the Danish-German border. With German bombers circling over the skies of Copenhagen, the Danish government had no choice but to accept the demand to allow German troops to enter Denmark. Germany confirmed that it had no intention of destroying Denmark's independence and territorial integrity. The Danish government's goal for the country and the people is to preserve them from the ravages of war. It is very sad that good Danish men lost their lives today. Our only wish is for peace. Negotiations to transform the government based on broad foundations are currently underway. (Reuters, 10th dispatch)

Malmö, Sweden: Malmö is separated from Copenhagen by water, but very little news comes from Copenhagen. It is only known that when the Germans attacked Copenhagen last night, the entire city was filled with an atmosphere of grief and sorrow. Three Danish soldiers were shot and killed by German troops in the city. The invading German troops included artillery units, infantry units, marine units, and air units. A unit of 150 Danish soldiers has crossed into Swedish territory. According to the captain, they hope to join the Swedish army. Most residents of Copenhagen did not know about the situation in their own country until they read the leaflets distributed by German aircraft. Before the outbreak of the European War, Copenhagen was a center for Nazi spies. Nazi party members are everywhere. It is reported that secret agents are currently conducting searches according to previously compiled lists. (Reuters, 10th dispatch)

### Situation in Oslo After Its Fall

Oslo: Oslo's fall did not involve significant resistance. Many residents of the city stood still and watched as German troops passed through the city's main streets. Upon landing, the German commander immediately went to the headquarters of the Norwegian police department to control all orders. The first batch of 300 German troops to enter the city included both those on horseback and those on foot. Observers said that they saw several Norwegian officers and German officers riding in the same car through the city. A German minesweeper was badly damaged while docking in Oslo Harbor. In the twenty hours before the German troops occupied the city, the outskirts of the city were bombed by German aircraft. In addition to occupying Oslo, the Germans also occupied the naval base of Horten at the entrance to Oslofjord. (Associated Press, 10th dispatch)

### Narvik's Fall - Two Norwegian Warships and Two British Ships Sunk in Resistance to German Warships

Stockholm: Yesterday, two Norwegian warships attempted to prevent German destroyers from entering the port and were attacked by mines. Before German troops occupied Narvik, a Norwegian port for transporting iron ore to Germany, they had suffered severe damage. At that time, two British ships were docked in the port and fired cannons at German warships carrying a large number of weapons, attempting to resist the German warships' shelling, and were also sunk. At this time, 1,500 German troops launched an attack on Narvik starting at 4:50 a.m. Two German warships entered the port in heavy snow, which seemed to be covering the German troops' actions, as the German advance was not discovered until they entered the port and fired cannons at the two ships. At that time, one British warship and one German merchant ship, upon seeing the German warships, were greatly surprised. The British ship immediately retaliated with small cannons, and one Norwegian warship also fired at the German warships. The German warships immediately launched torpedoes, and the warship was sunk. Of the 562 crew members, only 20 were reportedly rescued. The Germans were able to reach the center of the city at 5:05 a.m. and occupied the city at 5:30 a.m., as the Norwegian army on the shore did not offer resistance. However, it was reported that one Norwegian soldier and one policeman were shot. The personnel of the local consulate moved elsewhere when the shelling began. After the German warships engaged in combat with merchant ships in the port, German troops wearing helmets landed immediately. When the German troops landed, the residents remained silent and watched. All merchant ship crew members left their ships and went ashore, and were replaced by German crew members. There are 3,000 Norwegian troops in the area, but most are scattered in the valleys. When the German warships entered the port, the people on the shore initially thought they were British warships. It was not until the German warships fired cannons that they realized it was a German attack and were all terrified. Narvik's defensive capabilities were very weak. The port only had two warships engaged in combat with the German troops. They were sunk before even getting a shot off. (Associated Press, 10th dispatch)

### Swedish Government Declares Strict Neutrality; Practically Already Isolated; Ultimately Inevitable to be Drawn into the Vortex of War

Stockholm: According to Swedish Prime Minister Hansson, Germany sent a letter requesting Sweden to strictly adhere to neutrality. The Swedish government replied that it intends to maintain neutrality as usual, but reserves the freedom to take all plans necessary to maintain and defend neutrality. (Reuters, 10th)

Stockholm: At noon today, Sweden implemented partial air defense, as the Swedish situation is serious, and this step was taken. However, it is reported that it does not include a blackout or evacuation of residents, but rather the implementation of some air raid precautions, such as firefighting and first aid. (Reuters, 10th)

London: Swedish sources here claim that the German government has not applied the same pressure to Sweden as it did to Denmark, forcing it to accept its "protection." At the same time, according to Reuters' diplomatic correspondent, Scandinavians feel that the Germans do not need to threaten Sweden. They only need to continue their current military operations in southern Norway to cut off Sweden's access to aid from the West, which will isolate it and naturally lead it to submit. Scandinavian sources in London believe that Germany's goal is to completely occupy Norway and Denmark in order to "surround Sweden, but not to take direct action against it at this stage." (Reuters, 10th)

Berlin: Foreign diplomatic circles here believe that Sweden's involvement in the European war is imminent. If Britain and France send a large army to Narvik to defend Kiruna, it is feared that German troops will also land in southern Sweden and invade northern Sweden from the Gulf of Bothnia. If German troops invade southern Sweden, it could immediately pose a threat to occupy Stockholm. (United Press, 10th)

### The Future of Denmark and Norway

Amsterdam: The future of Denmark and Norway is currently being discussed by Germany. Neutral country correspondents say that the two countries may become protectorates of Germany, like Bohemia and Moravia, or vassals of Germany, like Slovakia, or suffer the same fate as Poland. It is expected that Germany will not relax its control over the two countries. Denmark is rich in agricultural products and will inevitably join the German economic system in the future. (Reuters, 10th)

### British Embassy in Norway Relocates; British Minister to Denmark Captured

London: Officials have confirmed that the Norwegian government is now in Hamar. The British Minister to Norway and his staff are accompanying the Norwegian government. The British Foreign Office has communicated with the British Embassy in Norway and received news that the Norwegian government is determined to resist the war in good spirits. London believes that the British Minister to Denmark and his staff have likely been captured by the Germans. Even if this does not violate international law, it is a serious breach of international conventions. However, if the British Embassy staff are indeed detained, they may be released later. According to well-informed sources here, Denmark's status may be regarded as an occupied territory similar to the Czech Republic. Britain will soon explain the legal status of Denmark arising from the German invasion. Britain will also likely explain the status of Iceland and the Faroe Islands, which belong to Denmark.

### Fierce Naval Battle Between British and German Navies off the Norwegian Coast; One British Ship Sunk, Three Heavily Damaged; Two German Heavy Cruisers Sunk

London: The Admiralty announced that several British destroyers attacked German naval forces in Norwegian waters at dawn today and encountered strong resistance. The British destroyer "Hunter" (1,340 tons) has been sunk, and the destroyer flotilla leader "Hardy" (1,455 tons) has run aground. The remaining ships have retreated. The number of casualties on each ship is still unknown, but a detailed list will be released as soon as possible. The German losses are not yet known, but according to unconfirmed reports from Stockholm, one German cruiser has been sunk. A British submarine fired a torpedo at a German cruiser near southern Norway yesterday, and it is believed that the ship has been sunk. British bombers attacked a German cruiser near Bergen last night, hitting it with one bomb. At the same time, a British naval aviation bomber also attacked a German cruiser in Norwegian waters this morning, hitting it with three bombs. (Reuters, 10th)

London: The Air Ministry issued a communiqué today stating that the British Air Force continuously attacked enemy cruisers in Bergen Bay last night. This was the first retaliatory measure taken by Britain after the German invasion of Norway. The German ships fired dense anti-aircraft fire at the time, but the British Air Force's attack caused heavy damage to the German ships, and among them, a cruiser was hit several times and suffered heavy damage. All aircraft returned safely to base after completing their missions. (Reuters, 10th)

Berlin: A German communiqué issued today acknowledged that the cruisers "Blücher" and "Karlsruhe" had been sunk. The "Blücher" was heavily damaged outside Oslo while trying to silence the 11-inch guns on the shore, and then struck several mines and sank. The "Karlsruhe" was sunk after encountering fierce resistance at Kristiansand. Most of the crew members were rescued. The "Blücher" was a 10,000-ton heavy cruiser, newly built last year, equipped with eight 8-inch heavy guns and three aircraft. The "Karlsruhe" was a 6,000-ton cruiser of the Königsberg class, equipped with nine 5.6-inch guns and six 3.5-inch anti-aircraft guns, built in 1929. (Reuters, 10th)

Berlin: The German High Command issued a communiqué stating that the German Air Force inflicted a "crushing defeat" on the British Navy yesterday evening. All ships were almost directly hit, and it claimed that four British battleships were each hit by several bombs, and two other battleships were each hit by one bomb. (Reuters, 10th)

Stockholm: According to news received here, a German cruiser is now berthed at the pier in Trondheim harbor. "Tidning报" reported that it heard late that there would be a major development in this harbor. Many believe that British ships will attempt to break into the harbor. According to news from Oslo, most of the city is under the control of German aircraft, and the number of landing troops is not large. (Reuters, 10th)

### Chamberlain Reports on British-German Naval Warfare; First Sea Lord Will Provide More Detailed Account in the House Today

London: Prime Minister Chamberlain announced in the House of Commons today that First Sea Lord Churchill will present a report on the naval battles near Norway tomorrow. (Reuters, 10th)

London: During the opening of the House of Commons today, Labour leader Attlee rose to speak and asked Prime Minister Chamberlain whether he would issue any detailed statement regarding the naval battle in the North Sea. The Prime Minister replied that he did not intend to make any general remarks regarding all aspects of the war. He hoped that more detailed information could be received when First Sea Lord Churchill made a statement tomorrow. However, the House would be very pleased to hear the account he had just received regarding the fierce battle between the British destroyer flotilla and the German Navy in Narvik this morning. Five British destroyers sailed into the bay and engaged six of the latest large German destroyers. The German-controlled shore batteries and newly installed coastal batteries also opened fire to assist. The British destroyer "Hunter" (1,340 tons) was sunk, the "Hardy" (1,455 tons) was heavily damaged and ran aground, the "Hotspur" (1,340 tons) was also heavily damaged, and the "Hostile" (1,340 tons) was slightly damaged. The remaining one was undamaged. The "Hotspur," after a fierce battle, was damaged and withdrew under the cover of the other two ships. The German destroyers did not seem to attempt to pursue. In addition, it is worth mentioning that six German merchant ships, largely loaded with German military supplies, have been sunk by British destroyers. When the British ships withdrew, they encountered the German ship "Ravensfels," loaded with German reserve ammunition, and sank it. (Cheers) The Prime Minister concluded by saying that this was all he knew, and the House would naturally not want him to say anything more. (Reuters, 10th)

London: Lord Stanhope stated in the House of Lords today about the naval battle of Narvik, saying that in this very difficult battle, the British Navy used glorious actions to resist the superior German Navy. The traditional honor of the British Navy has been fully maintained. Naval officers all said that if they could fight this kind of battle several more times, the Germans would regret it more and more. We have undoubtedly inflicted sufficient pain on the enemy in the Battle of Narvik. Former Home Secretary Viscount Samuel rose to say that Lord Stanhope's statement had first reported the number of unfortunate deaths and injuries of our navy, and ended with the achievements of our destroyer fleet. This would give a very misleading impression. In the future, when the government makes reports, it should always first state the achievements of the British fleet and then the casualties suffered. (Reuters, 10th)

### British Aircraft Flocks Fly to the North Sea to Attack German Ships

London: The British Air Ministry has just issued a communiqué stating, "Our aircraft flocks flew several times yesterday to the waters of Bergen Bay, Norway, to bomb German cruisers. Although enemy anti-aircraft fire was very fierce, one enemy ship was still heavily damaged, and all our aircraft have safely returned to their base." (Havas, 10th)

Berlin: According to official announcements, the German Air Force attacked British warships in the northern North Sea yesterday afternoon, hitting two British battleships, each with three bombs. Two heavy cruisers were also heavily damaged. One enemy ship was on fire, and another was tilted and unable to move. There was a lot of gasoline floating on the sea. (Haitong, 10th)

Oslo: Yesterday, British and German aircraft engaged in an aerial battle over Oslo. At that time, it was rumored here that a strong Allied air force was flying across the North Sea to aid Oslo. I saw German planes flying low over Oslo airfield, and many Norwegian planes were hit. However, the Norwegian Air Force bravely fought back. I have personally seen four German planes crash, and two Norwegian planes were also shot down. German bombers hit six planes at Fornebu Airport outside Oslo. No reports have yet been confirmed regarding other Allied aircraft heading to Oslo. However, it is rumored here that an Allied air force of 600 to 700 planes is now heading to Norway to assist. (United Press, 10th)

### Britain Practices its Promise to Aid Norway; Powerful Naval and Air Forces are Mobilized

Paris: A French naval spokesman said that the British and French fleets in the North Sea are currently cooperating fully. (Reuters, 10th)

London: After Germany's lightning invasion of Denmark and Norway, it is said that the first major naval battle between the British and German fleets has occurred in the turbulent waves off the Norwegian coast. Last night, the whole country was eagerly awaiting the outcome of this battle. Prime Minister Chamberlain told the House of Commons last night that the British strong fleet is currently at sea, implying that the navy will be able to prevent the German army from occupying Scandinavia, and that such good news will soon be transmitted. Although Chamberlain did not want to disclose the purpose of the navy's actions, he did not reject the possibility that the navy would have large-scale operations, such as escorting an expeditionary force to land on the Scandinavian Peninsula. The Prime Minister also confirmed the promise issued by the Foreign Office to provide full assistance to Norway. It is reported that British and French aircraft squadrons have now been dispatched to Norway. (Reuters, 10th)

### British Foreign Secretary's Speech: Northern Europe Must Not Be Invaded; The Future of British-Soviet Relations Depends on the Extent to Which the Soviet Union is Willing to Aid Germany

London: Foreign Secretary Halifax gave a speech here today, severely condemning the German army's attack on Denmark and Norway, saying that Germany's behavior is like a murderous madman, or a mad dog that bites anyone it sees. Today's war is not only a battle between belligerent countries. The outcome of this war is not only related to the fate of the warring countries, but also to the fate of all nations that love freedom and wish to preserve their independence. This point is now becoming increasingly clear. The political and military situation of the Scandinavian Peninsula is now chaotic, so the facts that have occurred cannot be fully known. It is rumored that Norway is now preparing to negotiate with Germany, but he does not know whether this statement is credibly based. If it is credibly based, then he dares to believe that the Allied governments will regard the Norwegian government as being coerced into doing so, and our determination to resist such barbarous manifestations on behalf of the powerless Norwegian country, and to resist Germany's expansion of strategic power in the North Sea and the Atlantic, will not change in the slightest because of this. Because Britain will never allow Germany to take this action. The Foreign Secretary then mentioned the British Navy, saying that everyone can recognize that the Navy is not slacking off now. The government is about to release information that is as detailed as possible to address public concerns. We are not yet able to determine the motives for Germany's initiation of conflict on the Scandinavian Peninsula. This may be due to the weakness within Germany that we may not fully know, but I intend I can affirm this, and this move may not bring pure benefits to Germany. I believe that this incident contains a kind of morality for neutral countries. Britain or France could have chosen a port or base in Norway at any time in the past six months and occupied it. If the neutral countries are not prepared to apply for assistance in a timely manner, then such events, I dare to predict, will inevitably be discovered, and they will apply for assistance when they are unable to provide effective assistance. Seeing that Germany chooses its neighbors with weak defenses for this invasion, this is in line with the cowardly practice of choosing the weak to attack. The Foreign Secretary then recounted the state of Germany tearing up the German-Danish non-aggression pact, and then said that the Norwegian government had been careful not to give Germany an excuse to initiate conflict. It can be seen from this that non-aggression pacts and careful self-preservation, if they are not beneficial to German policy, are of no use in avoiding Germany's aggressive policies.

The Foreign Secretary then recounted the various ways in which Germany's past actions violated the provisions of international law, and said, I expect the world to believe that the Allies can no longer tolerate such obvious acts of injustice, so the Allies have taken responsive measures, one of which is to lay mines in key sea areas. Today, anyone who is not in a position to defend themselves and encounters Germany's actions has no way to protect their safety. This is already a clear fact.

The Foreign Secretary continued, Today, some people want Britain to declare war on the Soviet Union, and some people want Britain to be friendly with the Soviet Union. We are not considering this issue because of our opposition to the Soviet Union's violent attacks on Poland and Finland. My opinion is that, in the current situation, we should still adhere to the main goal, which is to defeat Germany. The future of our relationship with the Soviet Union must and should depend on the extent to which the Soviet Union is willing to provide effective assistance to Germany for any reason. Other than this, everything else is insignificant. (Reuters, 10th)

London: Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State Butler stated in the House of Commons today in response to questions that the British government has not recently conducted negotiations with the Soviet Union regarding the continued discussion of trade issues. However, the Soviet ambassador to Britain mentioned this matter in recent conversations with the British Foreign Secretary. He also said that the date for the British ambassador to the Soviet Union to return to his post has not yet been determined. (Reuters, 10th)

### British Foreign Secretary Broadcasts: Sympathy for Norway and Denmark; Fighting Alongside Norway; Indignation at the German Invasion of Denmark

London: British Foreign Secretary Halifax gave a broadcast in Norwegian last night, expressing Britain's sympathy and encouragement for the resistance of the Norwegian government and people against the German invasion. He said, Norway is one of the world's leaders in peaceful technology and good administration. Britain and Norway should fight side by side until victory is achieved. The Foreign Secretary also broadcasted in Danish, saying that this is the second time that Denmark has suffered Germany's barbaric invasion. The British people are deeply indignant when they hear the news of the German invasion of Denmark, and are more determined to fight hard until Europe is freed from the harm of German aggression. (Reuters, 10th)

### Lord Harley's Speech: Warning the Civil Defense Forces to Prepare

London: Lord Harley, head of civil defense affairs for the northeast region of Britain, gave a speech in Hull last night, issuing a warning, saying, We are now entering a new stage in the war. All men serving in the civil defense forces must be prepared. The people of the Scandinavian Peninsula, who are now suffering the most barbaric and brutal aggression, are the ones who are most closely aligned with the British in terms of sentiment and shared interests. No one knows where the war will spread after it breaks out, so we must prepare early. (Reuters, 10th)

### Allies Hold Emergency Military Conference; Decide on Measures Regarding the Situation in Northern Europe; French Premier Reynaud Reports on the Situation

### American Oil Arriving in Vladivostok Has Not Been Shipped to Germany

London: British Minister of Economic Warfare Cross declared to Parliament yesterday that gasoline shipped from the United States to Vladivostok has not reached Germany. In response to an inquiry from a certain member, he said that he believed that the American oil shipped across the Pacific to Vladivostok last year was needed by the Soviet Union and was used for the Far East, and was never transported to Germany. Although the Soviet Union's gasoline import volume exceeded that of 1938, it did not exceed the previous years. At that time, Liberal Party member Mander asked whether Mr. Cross must know that 2.14 million barrels of American oil were delivered to Vladivostok in September last year, and asked what steps the government would take to prevent the reshipment of these supplies that strengthened the enemy. Cross replied that he did not know whether this number was accurate and would need to review the facts. (United Press, 10th)

### Netherlands Not Anxious; Continues to Adopt Military Precautions; Cabinet Discusses its Position in the Crisis; Belgium Solemnly Declares its Determination to Maintain Neutrality

Amsterdam: The Netherlands does not feel anxious about its immediate future. The Cabinet held an emergency meeting to consider the Netherlands' position in the new crisis. At that time, it was decided to suspend army leave, but as Reuters reporters heard, this step was not because the Netherlands believed that it was threatened, but to make it clear that the Netherlands was determined to resist invasion. The Netherlands has a more powerful army than the countries of the Scandinavian Peninsula, and its weapons and preparations are also better, and it has a famous water defense line. The Netherlands has been constantly working to improve its defenses in the past few months, and there is no fear of being trampled by iron hooves overnight. In recent days, the Netherlands has continued to take several kinds of military precautions in light of the serious situation. (Reuters, 10th)

Brussels: Belgian Prime Minister Pierlot recently met with Minister of Defense General Denis and Foreign Minister Spaak to discuss the latest developments in the international situation. It is also learned that important army generals will hold a meeting tonight. (Havas, 9th)

Brussels: Belgian officials are maintaining silence regarding the situation in Northern Europe. The general tendency of the people is to maintain a policy of strict neutrality. Prime Minister Pierlot and Foreign Minister Spaak yesterday called on Belgian newspapers to adopt a cautious attitude in their comments on the situation and to pay attention to Belgium's neutral position. According to the Times here, the Belgian Ministry of Defense has not taken any other measures in response to the current situation. (Haitong, 10th)

London: A statement issued by the London official stated that the German claim that the Allies intended to invade the Netherlands or Belgium was absurd. The German side believed that since Britain intended to invade the Netherlands or Belgium, Germany had good reason to act first. It is also in line with expectations that enemy countries would fabricate rumors to provide a basis for their invasion of other neutral countries. Its statement that Britain and France intend to invade the Netherlands and Belgium is extremely absurd, and no one believes it except the Germans. (Reuters, 10th)

### British Research: Strategy Against Germany – Aiming for Bergen, Norway, as a Major Target for Advance

London – A Reuters military correspondent reports that if Britain dispatches an expeditionary force to fight in Norway, the sheltered bays along the Norwegian coast will likely assume great importance. Joint operations involving the army, navy, and air force will be extremely difficult, requiring extensive staff work. Weather conditions will be a crucial factor. The success or failure of such military operations, especially during landings, will depend on the convenience of cover. The bays of Norway can provide the expeditionary force with highly ideal protection. It appears the British forces will not land north of Bergen, due to the difficult terrain further north and the greater distance from Oslo, which is, of course, one of the primary targets for advance. If the Allied forces capture Bergen, they can control the dangerous passage to the Skagerrak Strait and clear mines disrupting navigation in this narrow waterway. However, whether or not the British expeditionary force departs, Hitler is already fighting on two fronts. (Reuters, 10th)

### Shipping Restrictions in Denmark and Sweden

Copenhagen – The Danish Ministry of Commerce yesterday issued a decree that all Danish merchant ships and fishing boats cease sailing to foreign ports.

### One Soldier Killed Outside Jiangyin's North Gate – Puppet Authorities Audaciously Plan to Levy Land Tax

Hupu Correspondence: Jiangyin's North Gate, once a vital point for counties north of the Yangtze River, has transformed significantly over the past two years. A Japanese naval garrison is stationed at Huangtiangang. The day before yesterday, two Japanese soldiers, armed with firearms, were buying food pots in the main street outside the North Gate. One of them was shot dead by guerrillas, while the other escaped to the port and telephoned the city to report the incident. Subsequently, a large number of Japanese troops arrived at the scene and conducted a search, destroying the food pot shop completely. Residents and shopkeepers in the vicinity were severely beaten. The reason given for the beatings was that the local populace had failed to report the presence of guerrillas and plainclothes soldiers in the area beforehand and had allowed them to escape afterward. The puppet authorities, facing dwindling funds, had requested the Japanese garrison to dispatch more than thirty Japanese soldiers, disguised as puppet police, wearing Japanese uniforms, to be stationed in the Guoxiang, Zhouzhuang, Huashi, and Houteng areas at the end of last month, led by puppet land tax director Zhang Youlan and others, audaciously planning to levy land tax. However, as Dongxiang is a guerrilla stronghold, the Japanese soldiers were uneasy and forcibly conscripted villagers to build defensive fortifications around their encampments. Once the fortifications were completed, they remained holed up, afraid to venture out.

### US President Declares Intention to Revise Neutrality Act, Will Decide if a State of War Exists Between Germany and Denmark

Washington – After the news of Germany's occupation of Denmark and invasion of Norway reached the United States, the US government was compelled to engage in detailed discussions to determine diplomatic policy. The development of the situation in Northern Europe, its direct impact, and the overall war situation have generated speculation as to whether this situation will escalate into a major war, or merely intensify the existing economic warfare. Authorities recognize Germany's evident advancement, while many observers believe that the British navy will remain the main force in the overall war situation. President Roosevelt, speaking to reporters last night upon returning to Washington from Hyde Park, said that with the expansion of the European war to Northern Europe, he might immediately amend the US Neutrality Act. President Roosevelt also stated that this amendment would be released upon his arrival at the White House. The events of the past forty-eight hours have undoubtedly caused many Americans to consider the war's implications for the United States. After arriving in Washington, the President further stated that he might immediately determine whether a state of war exists between German troops and Denmark, and the circumstances of the German-Norwegian situation, and would decide the extent to which the scope of the war would further expand due to the new developments in Northern Europe. Democratic Senator George stated that the invasion of Northern Europe marked the beginning of a large-scale war. Senator Gillette predicted that a similar situation might arise in the Balkans, and stated that he hoped the United States would declare a one-week neutrality act for Northern Europe, which would place the entire American war effort, equipment, and other supplies to Denmark and Norway on a practical and effective basis. (United Press, 10th)

London – Foreign diplomats here conferred last night that if the Allied forces and Germany make contact in northern Sweden, extending the war to the Finnish border, then the Soviet Union's attitude may once again become crucial. Finnish diplomatic circles today expressed unease, fearing that Soviet troops might reoccupy Finland to prevent the Allied forces or Germany from invading Finnish territory. Soviet officials here made no indication of Moscow's intentions. (United Press, 10th)

Istanbul – Turkish military circles commented last night that if war breaks out between the Allied forces and Germany in Norway, they expect the Soviet Union may join the Scandinavian conflict. Another military source believes that the Soviet Union may occupy Finnish seaports and northern Sweden, depending on the scale of the Allied forces' operations in Scandinavia. (United Press, 10th)

London – According to Soviet sources in London, the Soviet Union's attitude towards the events in Denmark and Norway may not follow the direction indicated in the speech by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov on March 29. There is no reason to assume that yesterday's events will cause the Soviet Union to change its policy of maintaining neutrality and avoiding participation in the war. (Reuters, 10th)

Moscow – The German Ambassador to the Soviet Union met with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov last night for a lengthy discussion. (Reuters, 10th)

### Rumor: Soviet Union Makes New Demands on Finland – Urging Conclusion of Economic Pact, Railway to Sweden

Amsterdam – According to a Swedish radio broadcast received here last night, the Soviet Union has made new demands on Finland, including the immediate conclusion of an economic pact between the two countries, construction of a railway to the Swedish border, and the establishment of a Soviet-Finnish "joint venture" mining company, with the Soviet Union receiving 45% of Finland's ore production.

### US Chamber of Commerce Considers Retaliation Against Japan – Annual Meeting on the 29th

Washington – According to today's news, at the US Chamber of Commerce's annual meeting on the 29th of this month, a proposal to strengthen American policy in the Far East will be considered. The proposal includes the issue of how the United States should retaliate against Japan's restrictions on American trade in China. The US Chamber of Commerce has already released proposals from various chambers of commerce and the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai. The proposals from the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai are: (1) To develop and maintain American commercial opportunities in China, equal to those of other countries; (2) To demand that the US government's declared policies hold countries at war in the Far East fully responsible for damages to American citizens; (3) If Japan restricts and discriminates against American commerce in China, the United States should adopt reciprocal measures in its trade with Japan; (4) To develop the American merchant marine using effective and reliable crews. These proposals will form the basis of the US Chamber of Commerce's policies for the year. (United Press, 10th)

### Panama Canal Lock Construction Approved by US Senate

Washington – Yesterday, the Senate Appropriations Committee approved President Roosevelt's proposal in the War Department's bill to allocate US$15 million for the immediate construction of the third set of locks for the Panama Canal.

### Japanese Newspapers Report on Northern European War – Also Acknowledge German Aggression

Hong Kong – Tokyo dispatch: All evening newspapers here have featured headlines on the German use of force against Denmark and Norway. The wording used in the headlines often includes phrases such as "National Socialists invade Denmark, occupy Copenhagen," "German troops occupy Bergen, Norway," and "Norway declares war on Germany." Some newspapers released special editions. (Dispatch, 9th)

Tokyo – Business circles here believe that Japan will not be severely affected by the new developments in Northern Europe, as the commercial relationship between Japan and Norway and Denmark is not significant. In recent years, trade between Japan and these two countries has declined. However, Norway's declaration of war on Germany will affect Japanese shipping activities, as a large number of Norwegian ships are currently operating in the Far East. It is believed that these ships will soon withdraw from the Far East, making the shortage of ship space more acute. (Reuters, 10th)

### Governor's Cup Football in Hong Kong – Chinese United Team Retains Championship – Li Huitang Does Not Play – Chen Dehui Scores Two Goals Alone

(Hong Kong Correspondence) With continuous rain for days, it was expected that the Governor's Cup schedule would become a problem. Fortunately, the heavens helped, and in the afternoon of the 17th, it was barely raining, so this highly anticipated second battle of the Governor's Cup was able to be held as scheduled. Enthusiastic fans came in droves, and ticket revenue exceeded 2,500, which is not bad. After 90 minutes of intense fighting, the result was a 2-2 draw. According to the Governor's Cup system, the Chinese United team has already won one game and drawn one game, for a total of three points. The Western United team drew one game and only got one point. The Chinese United team thus won the three-time championship, fulfilling the ambition of tying the Western United team in terms of color sharing (in this eight-session, each has gained the championship four times). After the competition, the award was given by Assistant Secretary of Foreign Affairs Shi Mei. All the Chinese fans were very happy. The association held a celebration banquet at the Jinling Restaurant on the evening of the 18th, with toasts and exchanges of cups. It was a grand occasion. The ball lamps were bright, and the silver whistles sounded. Both sides lined up. Except for Li Huitang's absence due to a sore on his back, the lineup of the Chinese United team remained unchanged. Commander Chen Dehui was devoted to his duties and fulfilled his responsibilities, scoring two goals alone. The entire audience praised him. Hou Chengtong performed at his peak, and his passing was exceptionally wonderful, but due to bad luck, many of his powerful shots were blocked and bounced out by Luo Bianchen. Luo Bianchen's good skills and position deserve praise. Li Tiansheng was the biggest contributor to the defense. Liu Xianhan was not stage-shy and made excellent saves. Although Guo Yingqi did his best yesterday, his performance did not reach his standard. His performance between offense and defense was greatly affected. Zhong Yongshen also performed abnormally and was at fault.

The Western United team had six members who did not come, including Da Gaoshan, Sa La, Bifu, Williamson, Wei Lugan, and He Xi, and were supplemented by backups. Only Gan performed well. The rest were mediocre. Li Anna missed many opportunities, and Han Nibo's lack of power was even less worth mentioning. The Western United team was able to tie the Chinese United team due to the tightness of the defense, not the sharpness of the forwards. Shi scored a goal alone, which is evident. A half-and-half draw was a great achievement, but it was not enough to save the overall situation. However, if the Western United team can all take the stage and go all out, then the Chinese United team may also lose, and there will be another final.

### Finance: The Concept of a Declining Exchange Rate Suddenly Fades; the US Dollar Once Hit a Tight Price...Profitable Resales Were Active at Noon

Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation was affected by the sharp drop in overseas exchange rates, including the fall of 9.175 points against the pound. Therefore, the US dollar listing in this city was reduced by 125 points, retreating to $5.75, which was the tightest price since September 19 of last year. The Dutch Guilder also shrank, while other currencies such as the pound were stable. As for the domestic market situation, the environment changed rapidly, people were confused, and actions were inconsistent. In the early morning, the US dollar softened by 0.0625 to $5.90625 due to the sharp fall in the US-British exchange rate, while the British gold did not change. Later, the Japanese Bank Zhengjin and others frantically bought US dollars for 500,000 yuan, and speculators also scrambled to acquire them, mostly US dollars for April and May. At that time, the US Bank supplied the US dollar futures in a steady manner. However, the spot US dollar eventually showed a sluggish trend, and once saw an unprecedented tight price of $5.875. However, foreign telegrams suddenly reported that Minister of Finance Simon stated that the weakness of the pound was purely a normal phenomenon after exchange rate control and there was absolutely no need to worry. As a result, people's minds changed, and sellers emerged one after another, which led to a firmer market. The closing price of British gold remained unchanged, and the exchange rate was $5.9375, which was $5.454375 in combined exchange rate, resulting in a tight continuation of 0.03125 compared to the previous day. The potential of futures was slightly different from the spot price. Date is visible.

The Japanese Bank Closed with 500,000 Inflow

In the early morning, according to London, the near and far terms each increased by 375 points. Exchange rates for British against US, Shanghai, and French currencies were all flat. US against British currencies fell by 9.375 points, against Shanghai decreased by 0.25 yuan, against French currency decreased by a small 0.0525 yuan. The central listing of various currencies remained the same. Banks opened spot selling prices in the morning, British gold was 4 shillings 1.125 pence, the US dollar was $5.90625, compared to the previous closing, British currency remained flat and the US dollar tightened by 0.0625 due to the continued decline in exchange rates. After opening, the Japanese Bank and speculators came together to purchase April and May US dollar futures, and there were profitable closures of spot British gold, but banks such as Chase were still willing to supply, so the futures market remained stable. The spot US dollar continued to soften slightly, with transactions including opening bids of 4 shillings 1.125 pence, and this month's US dollar at $5.84375 and $5.8325, and May US dollar futures at $5.65625 and $5.625. At that time, the spot US dollar shrank to $5.875, but there were few opening transactions. The HSBC listing was announced, British currency remained flat and the US dollar shrank by 0.125. The silver balancing tax was announced to rise by 0.02 yuan. After that, Hong Kong Electric suddenly vomited spot US dollars, and at the same time, foreign telegrams reported that Minister of Finance Simon claimed that the lower price of the pound was a normal phenomenon after governance. Therefore, the local speculators' concept of a declining exchange rate suddenly faded, and the buyers remained silent. On the contrary, it caused profiteers to emerge, so the market gradually became firm. Hong Kong Electric sold spot US dollars to foreign firms at $5.9275, and speculators stuffed this month's US dollar futures to foreign firms at $5.875, and May US dollar futures at $5.6875. At the same time, foreign firms sold spot US dollars to Chinese banks in Shanghai at $5.90625. At noon, foreign firms were quite sincere, and the situation continued. By the close, the spot US dollar had returned to $5.9375, and British gold was still at 4 shillings 9.96875 pence. The result was that compared to the previous day, spot British currency remained flat and the US dollar tightened by 0.03125. This month's British currency also remained flat and the US dollar softened by 0.03125. There were no changes in British and US dollar futures for May. There is no market on Wednesday afterwards.

Hong Kong US Dollar Shrunk Sharply Again

Hong Kong, 10th (Reuters) - This morning, spot prices remained unchanged. The spot US dollar shrunk sharply by half a yuan to $21.4375. There were quoted prices for forward contracts, but no market. The Shanghai dollar spot price rose by 0.50 yuan. The Japanese Yen also tightened by 3.00 yuan, to 90.00 yuan. The price was flat at 11:30. The Shanghai dollar spot price continued to rise by 0.50 yuan, to 360.00 yuan. There were no other changes. There is no market on Wednesday afternoon.

Tianjin British and US Currencies Remained Flat

Tianjin, 10th (Wednesday Dispatch) - This morning, the exchange market opened flat. Spot prices for British currency, Shanghai currency, and the "Joint Note" black market were all unchanged. The spot US dollar shrunk by 0.15625 to $5.5625.

### Foreign Currencies Rise and Fall Rapidly

Yesterday's foreign currency market situation was full of stormy waves, with huge ups and downs. British and US gold pounds initially followed the rapid rise in gold prices. Afterwards, as gold prices fell together, the buying stopped. The supply and demand of British gold notes remained balanced. The price of US gold notes once reached $16.95, but then sellers rushed to close out their positions for profits, and the price fell to a low of $16.63. In the afternoon, it rose again to $16.77. The trend of Hong Kong notes was also strong. The demand for Dutch and Philippine notes was not weak. The demand for Canadian notes was quite strong, and the market price rose to $1.1325. The trend of Korean notes remained soft, and the evening market was $1.1125. The exchange rates of various currencies are detailed in the market price network.

### Discount Rate Rises by Another $3.50

Interbank Lending Rate Also Increases Greatly

Yesterday's bill discount standard continued to rise. The discount rate per thousand once soared to over $70. In the morning, it flew from around $67 to $73. After 10 o'clock, it gradually fell back. In the afternoon, the changes were small, around $69, which was $3.50 higher than the previous day. The Shanghai Money Dealers Association's interbank lending rate was quoted at $0.21 in both the morning and afternoon markets.

### The Gold Market Is Volatile and Unstable; After a Wild Increase, It Plunges Again; Ultimately, There Is No Difference in Price Compared to the Previous Day

Yesterday's cash gold black market situation rose sharply and then closed flat. The buying and selling were quite large, which made the price extremely volatile. The morning opening had already risen sharply by $45 to $5,700 because of the sharp fall in exchange rates that day. Later, when the US dollar tightened, buyers followed one another, and in the imbalance of supply and demand, a new gold record of $5,750 was created. At that time, money exchange shops and banks were the most enthusiastic in buying. However, the good times quickly changed. Foreign telegrams reported that British Finance Minister Simon claimed that the decline in the pound was a natural phenomenon after exchange control and there was no significant impact on the currency value. As a result, the US dollar in this city rebounded, and there were rumors that were unfavorable to buyers. In an instant, gold shops, banks, and some securities firm employees rushed to sell, and the selling frenzy prevailed, causing the price to plummet. The lowest price was $5,635, which was $20 lower than the previous day. Fortunately, gold shops bought back, which resulted in the closing price being flat, still at $5,655, the same as the previous day. This was $15 higher than the noon closing price. The final price was $5,670. The half-day transaction was still active, about 3,000 taels. Jewelry gold once hit an unprecedented price of $575, but then returned to flat. Customs gold remained stable.

Gold Reaches New High Price

Since the initial opening of each bar (10 taels) in the morning, exchange rates shrank by 9.375 points, and the US dollar tightened, so people's hearts were strong. The opening jumped up by $45. Gold shops and banks purchased dozens of taels in total, at $5,700. Afterwards, the US dollar continued to weaken, and the buying trend became even stronger. Money exchange shops, securities firms, and others rushed to buy, and in less than ten minutes, the price was raised by another $50. Banks sold to counterparties at $5,750. Unexpectedly, at the same time, a gold shop sold sharply at a high price, and some securities firms also vigorously sold. Then, the price fell back by dozens of dollars. Later, the US dollar suddenly rebounded, and the buying interest was even stronger for a time, returning to the $5,700 level. Gold shops sold 50 taels to money exchange shops for $5,675. Shortly afterwards, a gold shop suddenly came to buy again, and at the same time banks and others also dragged in retail investors, and at that time the US dollar stabilized, rising again by $35. Gold shops sold 50 taels to money exchange shops and others for $5,710. Later, because the foreign exchange US dollar relapsed, coupled with some securities firms taking the opportunity to sell again, it soon returned to the $5,700 level. Then, with the addition of bank assistance to sell, the selling frenzy grew from small to large, and it fell back by dozens of dollars. Banks sold 20 taels to securities firms at $5,635. At noon, sellers gradually decreased, and a gold shop suddenly came to search for purchases, rising by $45. Gold shops purchased 30 taels from banks at $5,680. Near the close, another gold shop sold vigorously, returning down $25. Gold shops sold 30 taels to securities firms for $5,655, as the noon closing price. In the afternoon, there is no market on Friday. As a result, there was no difference in price compared to the previous day. The half-day fluctuation was $115. The selling price of the cash gold shops was several dollars higher than the gold price, and the purchase price was reduced by $20. The current standard gold was more than $50 higher than the listed gold, and there were few opening transactions.

Jewelry Gold Rose and Then Returned

The initial exchange price of jewelry gold in silver shops was still $570 at Datongxing. By 9:30, it was $5 higher, hitting an unprecedented high price of $575. At 11:10, it fell back by a small $5. There were no changes after that. As a result, Datongxing was still $570, and the new counterparts were the same as the previous price. The purchase price was reduced by about $15.

### Yarn and Cloth: The Market Sentiment Is Excited; Yarn Prices Rise Straight Up

"Bian Ma" (Brand) Rises to $1275

The yarn market has surged. The European war seems to be expanding, and the price of gold is soaring, causing people's hearts to be excited and triggering a buying frenzy. The market is soaring. The spot price of 20-count "Bian Ma" (Brand) yarn is as high as $1,275 for Huidah. The closing price is $1,254.

At the opening of the spot yarn market this morning, it was heard that British and American exchange rates had fallen sharply and the exchange market was shrinking, which boosted people's spirits. The spot price of 20-count "Bian Ma" (Brand) yarn was $1,250. At this time, there were few sellers. At the same time, although the demand from Guangdong merchants was not as strong as the previous day, sporadic transactions were still uninterrupted, so the momentum was still strong, rising to $1,275. Then, due to profiteers selling, it fell back to $1,250. It is found that the transaction volume in half a day was 1,795 bales, and the market price of 20-count "Bian Ma" (Brand) yarn rose by $56. Today, 51 pieces of yarn are transported to Tianjin. The amount bought by each gang is listed as follows:

Counterparts: 1,335; Hong Kong: 460.

Total: 1,795

### Counterparts Compete to Purchase; Cotton Prices Rise Sharply

The trading of native cotton has slightly improved, but it is said that it is a mutual purchase between counterparts. This is because yarn prices are rising steadily, which has led to the rise of raw cotton, which is interdependent. However, the plant's actions are still rare, so the prices of all cotton types have risen by $3, $4, or $5. The transaction situation of spot cotton is listed on the left.

Another message: Foreign cotton market prices, the New York cotton market rose early in the morning due to good telegrams from Liverpool and a firm Indian cotton market. Later, due to the sudden changes in the European situation, overseas merchants purchased in the market, and as a result, the closing price was higher than the previous day, with the recent period rising by 4 or 5 pounds, and the distant period rising by 6 pounds. The Indian cotton market was also exceptionally enthusiastic due to the European situation. Yesterday, together with forecasts, it surged by 18 rupees. Egyptian rose by more than 10 pounds.

Shanghai port's foreign cotton transactions, due to the soaring of foreign cotton markets and the step-by-step following of yarn prices, each counterpart deeply worried that the ships transporting Indian cotton to Shanghai would have difficulties, so the purchase of spot goods in the market was quite fierce. The selling price was higher than the futures price. However, even with high prices, it was difficult to purchase large quantities. The factory price of yesterday's cotton market is converted at an exchange rate of US$5.9375 as follows.

### Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth Prices Continue to Rise Sharply

Yesterday's cotton cloth price increase was still strong, and new highs were created again. White cloth, fine cloth, twill, and coarse cloth rose by 50 cents to $1 per piece in the morning, and continued to rise by about 50 cents in the afternoon. The market for bleached and dyed cloth was chaotic, and there was no definite price. Generally, each piece rose by about $1. Merchants in the street continued to purchase more than 500 pieces of coarse cloth from factories such as Dapeng, Fugui, and Sanmao, fine cloth, twill, and Yihe. Cantonese merchants handled more than 200 pieces of colored cloth, colored twill, poplin, and bleached cloth. Henan and Anhui merchants handled more than 100 pieces of colored cloth, striped bleached cloth, and poplin. Sichuan and Yunnan merchants handled more than 100 pieces of Shilin cloth, fine cloth, and printed cloth. Zhejiang, Wenzhou, Taizhou, and Ningbo merchants handled 150-160 pieces of fine cloth, coarse cloth, and twill. Foreign merchants in Singapore handled more than 5,000 pieces of bleached and dyed cloth. Also, on the 11th, four pieces of piece goods were transported to Tianjin.

### Most Woolen Fabrics Are Ordered from England

Italian Goods Require US Dollars

Most of the major wholesalers in the woolen fabric industry order from England. This is because the price of goods in Shanghai is high, various goods are in short supply, and English goods are still priced in shillings and do not require payment of silver. Orders from Italy, according to telegrams from agencies, are all changed to US dollars, so the price increase is more expensive than English goods. In addition, most of them still require a 30% deposit in advance, which has created a larger business for ordering woolen fabrics from England.

### Securities: Many "Tong Bing" (Type C) Shares Sold

Foreign Stocks Had No Special Characteristics

The securities black market was depressed yesterday because of the lottery for Type C shares. However, it seems that there is still a good demand for these shares, but there is no imminent danger of a collapse. However, the soaring gold market has softened people's hearts, and there is no longer the excitement of the past. The future may be a period of circling. Yesterday, the prices of Type C shares, which were not selected in the lottery, broke through the $50 level, and Type B shares also broke through the $2 level. Although the buyers were still enthusiastic, they were already shrouded in a selling atmosphere. However, the decline was greater, and in the afternoon, the buyers again took the upper hand, and all items rebounded by 20-30 cents. The buyers still had remaining strength, and the market situation became firm. As a result, the price continued to be slightly smaller by 0.10-0.45. The total transaction volume was about 1.2 million yuan. A brief table is listed below.

Stock transactions included 150 shares of China Merchants Electric at a price of $7.90.

There were no special characteristics in the stock market of public companies, and the prices were rarely volatile. The opening price was the same as the previous closing price. Then, because buyers took advantage of the low prices to purchase, the market situation slightly improved, and then turned quieter. Under the current state of uncertainty, if the stock market's actions are good, there is nothing to criticize. Rubber stocks had a slight turnaround due to the large increase in spot prices abroad, but buyers did not seem impatient, so the prices were also flat.

London, 9th (Tuesday Dispatch) - Today's listed prices of British Far East company stocks, only Gula Clark and Lem Rubber stocks fell by 3 pence, the price was 18 shillings 6 pence, the rest were flat.

London, 9th (Tuesday Dispatch) - Today's listed Chinese foreign debts remained high and stable, and there were no changes in the bonds at various levels.

### Millington Company Pays Dividends

The 10th Annual General Meeting of Shareholders of the American Millington Company will be held on April 26. According to reports, the profit for 1939 reached more than 91,000 yuan in national currency, and the dividend is proposed to be 10%.

### Food: Rice Prices Rebound and Rise

The rice market currently plummeted again in the morning market, and immediately turned to ban again in the afternoon market. Yesterday, due to the small source of domestic rice from the mainland, a total of only more than 1,000 bags were exported from Hongkou, and gold prices rose and exchange rates continued to shrink. The rice merchants held back their goods and waited for the opportunity again. Rural villages and customer shops searched in many ways. Both domestic and foreign rice in the early market saw prices rise steadily. If the domestic rice sees early and late rice has opened at $40 and $39.50, Suzhou Tongbang Su Fen Geng at $40, and Dantu glutinous rice at $37.50, and then down to $35, while the foreign rice No. 1 Saigon was $42.20, $42, a sharp increase of $1 or $2 compared to the previous market. It was also heard that off-market black market trading rose against each other, with Changbang special rice at $43, Kun Geng at $42.50, $42, Qing Si special thin at $42, and Jiangbei sharp at $40. However, the overall situation is full of changes, although it rebounded one morning, people inevitably still harbor precautions, and if the price is too high, it is also tricky. Therefore, the sales market weakened again in the afternoon market, and the market price depreciated by 20-30 cents.

Foreign rice is constantly arriving in Shanghai. Yesterday, Taikoo Company's Qingyuan wheel arrived in port, carrying 3,024 bags from Hong Kong. Today, Jardine Matheson's Lisheng wheel is going to North China, with 500 bags of foreign rice going to Tianjin.

Yesterday, the foreign rice was stimulated by the exchange rate shrinking and gold prices rising, and the market had a big breathing space. The buying interest was extremely strong in the morning, especially the internal and external speculation and floating households were the most greedy. Because the exchange rate has shrunk and the production price is high, people's hearts suddenly turned upward. No. 1 Saigon, which closed at $40.05 the previous day, was raised to $42.50, and No. 1 was also close to $40. Huo Jiao rose to $41, and other high- and low-end grades generally rose, about $2 greater than the previous day. Then, because the floating households took profits and came out, and it was reported that a large amount of Dumai from the mainland was about to be shipped to Shanghai, people's hearts suddenly softened, and the market price fell by a small 50 cents to nearly one yuan. The situation continued to be weak in the afternoon. As a result, it was only about $1 greater. Returning to the Fanwei Qixi No. 2 in the early market in April and May was $50, and only $49.50 in the afternoon. The current delivery opened at $46.50. The total transaction volume was 300 tons for futures and 6,000 bags for spot goods.

### Wheat Flour Is Slightly Tight

Wheat flour is slightly tight, probably because the European war has expanded, gold has soared, and rice prices have risen, so people's hearts are tight. However, customers are slightly sluggish, and it is difficult for the market to develop. The Kaiyuan powder station is firm and unmoving. Laoche recalled that the initial asking price of the powder was similar to the Kaiyuan station. It once expanded and held in the morning. It was heard that the market price was 13.40 yuan, but there was no actual transaction. Only inland powder had some purchases from local customers, with a total of Shuangshi brand at 13.90 yuan and Shanlu brand at 12.85 yuan, slightly higher than before. It was also heard that the foreign fort station opened at 13.70 yuan, and a total of about 10,000 bags were traded.

The wheat market transaction was quite quiet, because it was widely rumored that a large batch of foreign wheat would arrive, and people's hearts were quite loose. Now that the European war situation is serious, the source of foreign wheat may be blocked, and the fixed wheat contract price is especially high, so those who hold the goods have a strong desire to sell again. However, Chinese factories have a lack of interest, and the market is rarely developed. As a result, the factory handled 5-600 bags of Suzhou wheat, and the price stood at the original price of $22.

### Oil Market: Crude Oil Continues to Rise by More Than One Yuan

Yesterday, the market situation of soybean oil and peanut oil was still separate. Under the continued interest of the Hong Kong merchants in peanut oil, the interest of merchants and hoarders was even better, and the market price continued to rise by 1.5 yuan. Soybean oil sales were dull and lacked the ability to develop. According to the statistics of the unified market, Dalian soybean oil was opened at 150 barrels, with a price of 105 yuan. Midway, it was 104.5 yuan, and then it returned to 105 yuan. The closing price was 105.20 yuan. Dayou Factory's soybean oil was traded at 100 dan, with a price of 81.50 yuan. Peanut oil was opened at 400 pieces of Guangzhou oil, with a price of 74.50 yuan. Qingdao oil was 300 barrels, with a price of 105-106 yuan. Jiangbei canned oil was 400 cans, with a price of 101 yuan.

### Coal: White Coal Price Increase

Coal Balls Also Raise Prices

Since the beginning of spring, the source of Hongji White Coal has become increasingly scarce, and because various factories have renovated their stoves, the destination has become more prosperous, resulting in an imbalance between supply and demand, and prices have risen steadily. Yesterday, the Hongji White Coal industry association continued to rise by $5, to $170 per ton. Hongji No. 2 dross (coal ball raw material) increased by $8, totaling $118. As a result, the Coal Ball Association held an emergency meeting. From now on, Yitaixing Nanyang Factory prices will uniformly increase by $8, $140 per ton for the gate to send customers, $17.5 per ton, and $7 per dan for retail.

### Silk and Tea: European War Expands; Japanese and American Silk Prices Rebound; Local Market Also Becomes Active

Japanese and American silk prices were weak, but both rose sharply yesterday due to the expansion of the European war. Yokohama spot prices rose by $90, and distant-term prices rose by $111. New York near-term prices rose by $0.16, and distant-term prices rose by $0.17. New York China-Japan raw silk spot prices rose by $0.07-$0.08.

The local silk market also became active immediately. Companies such as Jardine Matheson and Da Chang purchased 70 pieces of Baichang silk and 50 pieces of Qili silk. Silk prices all surged by $50 to $150. The silk market, which had been depressed for several weeks, has begun to turn around yesterday.

### Tea Sales Return to Quiet

The sales of green tea to British and French merchants are all indifferent because European war expands and the future changes are unpredictable. The entire city has only purchased 130 boxes of Chou Xin Zhen Mei green tea and Xi Zhen Mei from Baochang and Ruichang, etc. The selling price of Chou Zhen Mei is $320, and the selling price of Zhen Mei is from $60 to $80. The market price has fallen by $10-$20 compared to before.

### Sugar Market: Coarse White Rises Again

Yesterday, there were no changes in the foreign telegrams in the sugar market, but the listing by the local association continued to tighten. The opening price in the morning was especially high. The price of 24 crude white sugar was $64.50 at the local station and $64 for new goods at foreign stations. The closing price returned to $63.70. The price of old goods arriving in June of last year was $63, transit goods were $51, crude red was $52.70, and transit was $44. Taikoo Che Bai and Che red sugar saw further expansion. B west station new goods were $68.70, old goods were $68.50, CW was $68.30, CX was $68.20, DY was $68, and HX was $67.80. Dong station goods were reduced by $0.30, H red was $49.50, Ben Xue Bai was $63.50, Ben Bing was $75.50, and Jingming Bing was $77.

### Medicinal Materials: Scarcity of Shan Gualou

Because the source of Shan Nai has been temporarily cut off, the sales here rely solely on the stock from last winter for support. Currently, it is about to be sold out. Although merchants still have a small number of transactions, the price is as high as $80. It is heard that a certain firm has directly arranged a batch from Shantou and is trying to ship it. It is expected to arrive in Shanghai within a month.

Recently, a batch of Gualou has arrived to meet the appropriate sales order and was sold immediately. It is estimated that the Gualou skin is $155 and the Gualou seeds are $150. However, the quantity of incoming goods is still small, and it seems that the demand is exceeding the supply. The situation is very stable.

### Seafood: Western Sea Cucumbers Are Certainly Expensive; Light Sea Cucumbers Drop Slightly

A batch of Western sea cucumbers has been opened again, and the prices are quite high. Because the source is scarce, it is difficult to hope for a decline. The bidding price for Cage Teeth is $377, No. 1 is $175, No. 1 is $372, No. 3 is $353, No. 4 is $303, and Small Medium is $278. The bidding price for Chen Xiang selection is $385, No. 1 is $372, No. 2 is $360, No. 3-4 is $325, and Xian Da Gang's bidding price is $312, No. 1 is $296, Da 2 is $305, No. 2 is $302, No. 3 is $288, No. 4 is $256, and Small Medium is $220.

The arrival of Siamese dried mussels is successive, so the bottom stock is sufficient, the destination has turned weak, and the momentum is slightly soft. For example, the opening price yesterday was $182, which was $7-$8 lower than before.

Since the domestic mushrooms have been purchased and sold in Hong Kong, the exchange rate is quite profitable, resulting in high bottom prices. Recently, the demand of the help has been stagnant, and the source of supply from various places here has turned strong, and the market has become increasingly flat. For example, the trading price of Chuzhou Longquan mushrooms, which were opened the day before yesterday, was only $450.

### North and South Goods: Pumpkin Seeds, Rice Noodles, and Dried Goods – All Increasing in Price Due to Shortages

White melon seeds are still scarce in origin, and market conditions remain tight. A few days ago, dozens of packages arrived, priced at eighty-five yuan. It is said that they have already been traded, opening at eighty-four yuan, an increase of nine yuan compared to before, indicating a highly profitable batch.

Longkou vermicelli, previously as high as one hundred and thirty yuan due to shortages, is now scarce. Qingdao vermicelli is currently priced at one hundred and ten yuan. However, hot pot vermicelli is softening due to a decrease in demand. For example, Yingshan goods are at seventy-five yuan, and Hekou goods are at sixty-five yuan. Jiangbei goods are temporarily out of stock.

Xian rice flakes, previously priced at nine hundred and fifty yuan due to low stock, were even higher at one thousand yuan. Recently, shipments have also arrived from Ningbo, easing market conditions. Yesterday, the market price was nine hundred yuan, a decrease of one hundred yuan.

### The Husband is the Creator of Love

The wife is the savings bank of love...

Undoubtedly, in the love between husband and wife, the husband is in the active, creative position. An enlightened husband not only understands his wife's personality well, but also her physiological characteristics, needs, and changes. He then uses his loving skills to create a work of art of love. Therefore, many girls are very proud in their parents' home, but after marrying a husband, they transform into someone leaning on her husband like a little bird. Some have very luxurious lifestyles before marriage, but after marriage, they suddenly become thrifty housewives. She saves all the love created by her husband and the money earned from work. As a result, she becomes a woman rich in love, and their family becomes a financially prosperous family. What is even more surprising is that the wife's body and mind often change according to the husband's wishes. The thin will become fat, and the weak and ugly will become healthy and beautiful. The beauty of the breasts and the clarity of the curves become more and more obvious after marriage. As for their intelligent and lively children, who are jointly born, they are even more their living treasures. Therefore, it is said that the most satisfactory lover is not naturally made, but artificially made. This sentence has a profound meaning.

Since the husband is the creator of love, he should devote himself to the beautiful creation of your love. Starting from managing the family, governing the country, and bringing peace to the world may not be the wrong path. However, creation requires creative energy. If the husband is truly energetic and strong, the wife and concubines will naturally be more beautiful and affectionate. With more affection between husband and wife, they can naturally create a happy family with ease. If a man has committed masturbation and excessive indulgence in his youth, damaging the endocrine function of his reproductive glands, resulting in nocturnal emission, kidney deficiency, impotence, incomplete development, neurasthenia and other symptoms, then after marriage, he will not be able to comfort his wife's heart, and in marital life he will incur his wife's hatred. How can love arise from this? Even the love that existed before will be destroyed because of this! A couple without love are like nails in each other's eyes during the day and dream different dreams in the same bed at night. What is the pain in their hearts like? Because of pain, they worry, resent, and hate. Even a gentle woman will turn into a shrew, and a physically fit young woman will turn into a resentful woman. Or, due to emotional debates, tragedies such as elopement, suicide, and divorce occur, which are also seen in today's social news from time to time!

Since the husband's energy is so important, if you unfortunately already have the above-mentioned symptoms, you must seek medical treatment as soon as possible. Treatment: According to world-renowned doctors and our experience, taking 'Reproductin', a preparation made from the reproductive gland hormones of healthy animals, is the most effective and specific treatment. This preparation is made from the essence of reproductive gland hormones extracted from the bodies of healthy animals such as lions, tigers, orangutans, bears, deer, and sea dogs, and is made using scientific replication methods, so its quality is precious and its effect is certain, surpassing any similar preparation. Men can produce sperm, nourish the kidneys, strengthen the brain, and activate blood circulation within one day of taking it. Continuous use for one month can also help growth and nourish nerves. It will definitely cure all symptoms, increase energy. Middle-aged and elderly people who take it regularly will prolong life, rejuvenate themselves. However, those suffering from nocturnal emission must also take 'Hymettus Semen-Stopping Pills' (available in all major pharmacies such as Sino-Western Wuzhou and the Western medicine department of Wing On Company, priced at two yuan per box) to consolidate the sperm gate and stop leakage, so that the effect is even faster.

### What is the Impact of Breast Atrophy?

— Yao Chongpei, American Medical Doctor

A healthy and beautiful young woman with high breasts, plump hips, a slender waist, and obvious curves is indeed like the darling of society. She is fragrant, sweet, respected, and pursued everywhere. She not only enjoys all kinds of material advantages, but also her body and mind are not the same as those of women with breast atrophy, thin hips, and loss of beauty. According to medical judgments, the reason why the breasts can be high and elastic is entirely due to the healthy function of the ovaries and the vigorous metabolism. The academia is full of new cells. As a result, the characteristics are developed, the complexion is ruddy, the skin is delicate, the thinking is agile, and the temperament is gentle. Even when encountering difficulties, she can make decisive decisions, and even when encountering unwanted things, she can handle them calmly without becoming irritable and angry. With an open mind and a strong will, such women, once married, will have very deep feelings between husband and wife, building happy families and giving birth to virtuous wives and loving mothers. However, women with breast atrophy, thin hips, and loss of beauty not only do not have this happiness, but also suffer from many diseases and pains, experiencing the misery of the world! The only way to remedy it. According to Chinese and Western doctors and our experience, only taking the female "Reproductin," a reproductive gland ovarian hormone preparation, is the most effective and specific treatment. This preparation was invented by Dr. Steiner, a world-renowned master of physiology, after more than thirty years of hard work and experimentation. In addition to collecting ovarian glands, liver paste, and pituitary glands from young animals, it also contains minerals and plants, iron, manganese, and multiple vitamins, and is meticulously produced under the most perfect scientific equipment, so the medicinal properties are very peaceful, and the medicinal power is completely preserved, and there are no side effects. It can be taken regularly regardless of the cold or heat. If you take it in the booming season of spring, it can be twice as effective, making the atrophied breasts appear high in a short period of time, relieving various diseases in the body, promoting metabolism. Ruddy cheeks, enhance beauty.

### The Tragedy of Nocturnal Emission Youths After the Warm Spring

— Zhan Nianceng, Venereal Disease Specialist

"The weather is getting warmer and the days are getting longer because of people." The warm spring weather is most likely to make people sleepy! Especially for young people with nocturnal emission, because of the loss of energy, after the warm spring, they often feel dizzy, have poor memory, and dull thinking. The schoolwork is difficult to improve; if they work in the industry, they often feel sore back and pain in the waist after a little hard work and cannot be competent. If they are already married, they often have early decline in energy and impotence in marital life, or because of long-term nocturnal emission, it leads to incomplete development and early decline in energy, and they cannot be human beings at all, then isn't youth happiness also cut off? Therefore, young people with nocturnal emission must make decisive decisions and make a plan for a radical cure as soon as possible. If they delay, the energy will gradually be lost, and the tragedy after the warm spring is unimaginable!

Why does a man's semen, which is well hidden in the seminal vesicles, leak out involuntarily? According to medical judgment, it is mostly because of masturbation and excessive indulgence in his early years, which damaged the sexual nerves and loosened the sperm gate. Therefore, to fundamentally cure nocturnal emission, it is also necessary to consolidate the sperm gate as the best strategy. 'Hymettus Semen-Stopping Pills', a famous German special medicine for curing nocturnal emission, fully possesses this effect. Patients should swallow three pills with boiled water before going to bed, which has the special effects of calming the mind, nourishing the nerves, consolidating the sperm gate, and radically curing nocturnal emission that night. If the above-mentioned symptoms have already occurred due to nocturnal emission, it is necessary to also take 'Reproductin', a preparation of healthy animal reproductive gland hormones, to nourish the brain and kidneys, increase essence and blood, nourish the nerves, and promote development. If you can continue to take it continuously, you will definitely cure all symptoms in a short period of time, making your energy abundant and your mind clear. If you are a young person with energy, thought, and ability, then how can the future be limited! If patients, for the sake of prudence, can personally come to our clinic to also apply new techniques such as electrotherapy and injection, it can be guaranteed to be cured.

### Unintentionally Turning into Chronic Gonorrhea

In the initial acute symptoms, chronic gonorrhea often develops unconsciously. According to the results of my many years of experience, in addition to gonococci, there are also many other bacteria mixed in, especially those caused by bacilli are the most common. The patient's self-consciousness is a feeling of discomfort and itching in the urethra, or a slight pain, and only then does he ask the doctor for diagnosis and treatment. However, due to the mild symptoms, the patient neglects treatment and health care, so unconsciously, the gonococci invade the posterior urethra from the anterior urethra, causing prostatitis, seminal vesiculitis, orchitis, cystitis, and systemic infectious arthritis, and only then does he know that his disease has not only not been cured, but has become worse.

Sometimes, in such symptoms, the urine is not completely turbid, and it is mostly transparent or slightly lymphatic. However, in fact, such venues are often unintentionally transmitted to the opposite sex, so husbands who already have wives should pay attention to the symptoms of such chronic gonorrhea and seek immediate cure. Whenever you encounter such symptoms, you must use urine culture, repeated examination, or prostatic massage to examine the liquid that is drained under a microscope, and you will be able to find gonococci and other bacilli to determine the location of gonorrhea, and then treat according to the symptoms. In terms of treatment methods, German Filtrin current therapy is the first choice, because the conductor is inserted into the inside of the urethra, and then the degree of electricity is opened according to the severity of the disease, so that the bactericidal power is directly projected onto the lesion, just right. German Heiss serum is also selected to resist gonorrhea, kill bacteria, and immunize. Other methods such as washing, massage, cooling, and hot bath can be applied according to the symptoms. Then, chronic gonorrhea with such symptoms can be cured radically in four or five weeks. It also treats syphilis, hemorrhoids, and removes the foreskin with a painless new method.

### Today's Board Election Results - A Glimpse into the Future Fate of the Concession - More Than 5,000 Votes Cast at Two Locations Yesterday - British and American Candidates Already Had an Advantage Yesterday - One of the Most Tense Pages in the History of the Concession

This year's Municipal Council board election, one of the most tense scenes in the seventy-year history of the Public Concession, unfolded yesterday. The voting was divided into two locations: one was in the drill hall of the Youguo Merchants Group on Fuzhou Road, and the other was in the Hongkou small market. From yesterday morning until 2 pm today, nine people will be elected from the thirteen candidates: (1) Alerman, (2) Benar, (3) Tian Cheng, (4) Hai Lai, (5) Hanxiong Taro, (6) Kai Ziwei, (7) Kuroda Keitaro, (8) Rotlik McDonald, (9) Renault McDonald, (10) Mitchell, (11) Okamoto Kazusaku, (12) Okamoto Otsuichi, (13) Powell, etc. The British and American side, seeing the Japanese side's attempt to seize administrative power of the concession, suddenly increased the number of candidates to five. Knowing its intentions, in order to maintain the status quo of the concession and safeguard the rights and interests that the British and American side have in the concession, they formed a micro-united front and took consistent steps to fully deal with the Japanese side. Other taxpayers from various countries in Shanghai, initially confused by the Japanese side's sweet words and dissatisfied with the current financial and administrative measures of the Municipal Council, a small number of taxpayers tended to support Japanese taxpayers. However, the majority of those who understood the righteousness, carefully considered the pros and cons, and weighed the pros and cons, were intimidated by the Japanese side's precedent of excluding the rights and interests of third countries in the occupied areas. In addition, with the British and American side's repeated calls, the entire situation has already changed. At this time, we cannot predict the election results, which side will ultimately win. But for the sake of justice and fairness, for the safety of Shanghai residents, we certainly do not want the fate of the French Concession in Hankou, the British Concession in Tianjin, and the public concession in Xiamen to come to the sea. Here is a detailed account of yesterday's tense situation,

The Number of Votes at Both Locations is Similar

Shanghai Xiqiao taxpayers began voting yesterday. According to reports from the ballot collection offices at the drill field of the International Business Corps and the Hongkou small market, as of 3 pm, the two locations had collected a total of more than 5,000 votes. According to eyewitnesses, the biggest difficulty at the ballot collection office was excessive crowding. Before voting, each taxpayer with a red scarf had to check whether their name had been registered. Those responsible for checking checked according to the first letter of their names. Yesterday, only two people were responsible for checking the letters A "B" "C". They were too busy, so it took a very long time to put the election tickets into the box. However, the two people who were responsible for checking the letters "X" "Y" "Z" were very free and easy to cope with, and the voting process was also quite fast. According to the report of the ballot collection office in the drill hall of the International Business Corps, a total of 3,000 votes were collected there. According to news from the American side, as of yesterday, there were few American taxpayers who had not voted. The American Association will continue to persuade taxpayers not to give up their rights today. The number of British voters is also large, and there should be more today than yesterday. Therefore, according to general speculation, the voting situation today will be even more tense. By 3 pm today, a total of more than 10,000 votes should be collected.

Jews in Hongkou are Stubborn

According to the report of the voting office in the Hongkou small market, as of 3 pm yesterday, a total of 2,500 votes were collected. Among them, about 2,200 votes were cast by Japanese taxpayers, and about 300 votes were cast by Jewish refugees and Jewish residents. It is said that at 9:20 am yesterday, forty minutes before the voting started, there were more than 200 Japanese residents waiting at the door of the Hongkou ballot collection office. By 10 am, the number had increased to more than 600. After the voting started, they flocked in, with Japanese women and Westerners mixed among them. The order was good throughout the day. Only one person lost his admission certificate and asked for a replacement. At the same time, pro-Japanese Jews posted slogans in various parts of Hongkou, saying, "Don't forget that we live in Hongkou," as a reason to support Japanese candidates. It is learned that several Jews were working in the election committee office of the Japanese side on Zhaofeng Road yesterday, and they were very busy. It is said that more than 250 Jews have been attracted to Qiaobei by them to vote in favor of Japanese candidates. They delusional that the Japanese would help their relatives and friends escape the European fire pit and come to Shanghai.

Japanese Extravagance Cannot be Realized

The English-language Da Mei Evening News said that the voting for the next board of directors of the Municipal Council began this morning (the 11th). A large number of taxpayers went to the two voting sites in the drill hall of the business group in the Municipal Council Building and the Hongkou vegetable market to vote. There was an endless stream of people all day long. The British, American, and Japanese expatriate election committees urged their expatriates to participate in the voting. The work was busy and unprecedented. According to well-informed sources, British and American candidates should get the majority of votes. The Japanese hope to exclude three British and American candidates, which is like trying to catch the moon in the water.

Japanese Taxpayers Arrived Earliest

The first to arrive at the Municipal Council Building to vote were Japanese taxpayers, and their number was very large, so other expatriates who arrived later had to wait behind and enter in turn after a long wait. In front of the voting site, there was a team of inspectors sent by the Japanese side, carefully counting the number of people entering the venue and recording the number in a notebook. Outside, there were also four plainclothes Japanese. At the entrance of the Hongkou vegetable market voting site, there was a special information desk set up by the Japanese side. This was pre-authorized.

The Voting Arrangement is Very Careful

In view of the large number of voters this year, the Municipal Council has made proper arrangements in advance, such as adding voting booths and increasing the number of ticket distribution tables in the two voting sites, and classifying them. To enter the voting site, you must show your voting certificate, and after checking that it is correct, you can receive the election ticket, fill it out and put it into the ballot box.

Both Locations Have Special Personnel to Take Care of Them

The person in charge of the voting site in the Municipal Council Building is Middleton, the deputy director of the finance department. The person in charge of managing the Hongkou vegetable market is Comolli of the tax office. Each has many assistants to help take care of it. The advertisements published in various newspapers today instructed taxpayers not to elect the independent British candidate Renault McDonald. McDonald ordered people to distribute leaflets at the voting site, asking people to vote for "British independent candidate Renault McDonald, No. 9".

The Last Activities of the British and American Side

The American Election Committee specially installed six telephone lines in the American General Assembly and notified all taxpayers in the United States by telephone this morning to vote as soon as possible. The British Election Committee has been active for more than a month, and today is the most active. It is expected that the number of British taxpayers participating in the voting will be much higher than usual. For the convenience of British and American taxpayers, the two committees specially sent vehicles to pick up and drop off expatriates to vote.

Voting Booths and Tables Added Today

The Municipal Council, because the Japanese suddenly increased the number of candidates to as many as five, and boasted that they could get the support of the majority of taxpayers, the British and American expatriates also believed that they could not maintain their rights and interests if they did not strive for victory, so they carried out large-scale activities, and voters must be enthusiastic, causing the polling stations set up to be extremely crowded. In order to meet the needs, it was decided to add a number of polling stations at the Hongkou small market and the drill hall of the International Business Corps today, in the hope of completing the voting within two days.

The Civilian Register Compiled by the Japanese Has Not Been Rechecked

The Municipal Council was concerned that the election register created by the Japanese side might have fraudulent situations, so the tax collection department sent personnel to recheck it to clarify whether all indirect taxpayers met the qualifications of electors. However, due to the short time, the investigation work was not widespread. In order to avoid conflicts with the Japanese side, election certificates were specially issued according to the register for those who had not been rechecked.

Lin Xionggi and Others Stayed Up Several Nights

In order to achieve electoral victory and manipulate the administration of the concession, the Japanese side worked desperately in organization and propaganda. Lin Xionggi and other election committee members therefore stayed up several nights. In the Hongkou area the day before yesterday, leaflets and slogans posted by the Japanese election committee could be seen everywhere, encouraging Japanese people with the right to vote, "Don't give up your valuable vote", "Elect Japanese candidates", "Don't forget to sign on the election ticket". The Continental News yesterday even used the headline "Arrest and Establish a New Order in Shanghai" as the first news item, advocating "implementing the principles of the East Asian New Order in Shanghai with the victory of the election battle". Lin Xionggi also issued a statement on the evening of the 9th, saying that maintaining the status quo, although once supported by the world, but the situation has changed, this concept is difficult to exist. The Japanese must break the status quo of the Shanghai concession and build a "new order". This election battle is the first step in breaking the status quo. Although it is difficult to foresee the outcome of this battle, the Japanese must devote all their efforts to implement the proposition they hold for the Shanghai concession." From this point of view, the Japanese side's ambition to monopolize the rights and interests of Shanghai and eliminate the position of European and American countries in Shanghai has reached the point of extreme urgency and cannot be concealed. In order to have an excuse after the failure of the election, and to make it difficult for the Municipal Council, the Japanese side created various news on the Japanese newspapers yesterday, attacking the Municipal Council, saying that in many Jewish coffee shops, British police officers sent by the Municipal Council were demonstrating and persuading Jewish electors, and British police officers were visiting Jewish people door to door to promote and instruct them to vote for British and American candidates.

The Speaker of the Japanese Side - The Implied Meaning

The speaker of the Japanese Embassy claimed at a reception for news reporters yesterday that the publicity of the British and American side on this election was almost completely ineffective. It is claimed that the reason held by the British and American side is nothing more than that the Japanese side is trying to control the concession and exclude the rights and interests of the British and American side in China. They even hinted that the order of the concession will be greatly disrupted as a result, but no matter what the result of the election, he believes that the concession should absolutely maintain internationalization," and the Japanese can occupy a better position in the Municipal Council, and also said that what the Japanese side hopes is to gradually improve the administration of the concession and become completely internationalized. The speaker also declared that at present, the Japanese side has formed a committee composed of a British, a Dutch, a Chinese, and a Japanese to study the issue of how to make the concession internationalized, and expressed the willingness of other expatriates to also participate in this committee. Finally, the speaker also believes that the result of this election is either all five Japanese candidates will be elected or all will be defeated.

### Western Press Pays Close Attention: The Results of This Election Expose All of the Japanese Inner Conspiracies - Do Not Let Shanghai Suffer the Fate of Tianjin

The tense situation of the Shanghai Municipal Council’s current board election can be seen in the records of Japanese and Western newspapers. Yesterday, in addition to prominent headlines like “Election Begins,” Western newspapers such as the North-China Daily News also published a large advertisement on the front page showing the style of the ballot. To the left of the names of the British and American candidates, they attached an "X" mark, instructing taxpayers to take united action. Under the names of candidates Reynold MacDonald and the Japanese candidates, they wrote the words "Leave it blank" in large characters and indicated the blank space with arrows. The fifth page of the China Press published a larger advertisement than the North-China Daily News, taking up nearly half the page, with the words "The American Association asks every registered voter to vote early in support of the seven British and American candidates." The Shanghai Times had a long commentary on the matter. The editorial of the China Press was even more active and was placed before the European war commentary, showing how much the British and Americans valued this election.

Shanghai's Future Hinges on Today

The China Press published an editorial yesterday titled "Shanghai at the Crossroads," stating roughly that the future of the Shanghai International Settlement is now in the hands of the city's voters. Whether they will vote today to determine the status quo of the Municipal Council will be seen in the election results. The most important question in these next two days is whether the international status of the Public Concession will be preserved or controlled by the Japanese, turning the city into a Japanese imperial outpost. As for the wasteful policies and administrative efficiency of the Municipal Council, these issues are not part of the election platform. If the financial and administrative policies of the Municipal Council need to be reformed, it must be delayed until the threat to the safety of the Public Concession is eliminated. It is not difficult to see that the fundamental purpose of the Japanese using the election method to gain control of the Public Concession. Japanese candidates and official spokesmen have said that the Japanese goal is to modernize the Public Concession and make it an economical administrative organ. This is deceitful talk. It should be known that the Japanese have nominated five candidates, and if their goal is reform, then there is an irrefutable fact that can be used as evidence: the Japanese should first vigorously reorganize the area outside the Shanghai-West border roads. That area needs a fair and effective administrative organ far more urgently than the Public Concession itself. The Japanese have not shown their ability or intention to cultivate a fair and effective administrative organ in the occupied cities of China and the suburbs of Shanghai. This shows that if the Japanese take over the Municipal Council, they will not be able to establish a more effective and fair administrative system in the Public Concession. The Japanese so-called goal of reform is nothing more than campaign rhetoric. Their sole purpose is to place this international city under the military, economic, and political control of their country. This can be stated with certainty.

Westerners Reveal Japanese Ambitions

(1) A Western taxpayer sent a letter to the North-China Daily News yesterday, strongly criticizing the Japanese ambition to control the concession. It stated: "Some people think that after the Japanese control the administration of the concession, the situation will not deteriorate further, and may even improve the status quo. In fact, this is completely wrong. After the concession is controlled by the Japanese, we can take Hongkou and Nanshi as a warning. Today, Hongkou and Nanshi are still barren lands. This is not because the rising living standards of the citizens make it difficult to restore the old appearance, but it is enough to prove what the power of the Japanese is like. Or it is said that the Japanese control of Hongkou and Nanshi is a military action, not a political one, so it is very difficult to restore the area to its original state. This statement is reasonable to a certain extent, but if we compare it with the situation in the areas beyond the boundaries, such as the Japanese arbitrarily arresting a certain Russian woman in Hongkou, disturbing the American commercial radio station, and the Japanese army's continued blockade of the Yangtze River and the Pearl River, Westerners cannot sympathize with the Japanese. Therefore, any Westerner who does not recognize the goal and votes for Japanese candidates in this election will be to blame once the concession is controlled by the Japanese army, and will inevitably suffer the consequences." The letter also strongly attacked the participation of independent candidate Reynold MacDonald. It shouted loudly and appealed to Western taxpayers to vote for the seven British and American candidates, fearing that Reynold MacDonald would disperse the votes of the seven, causing the Japanese to succeed by chance. This matter is of great importance, so it called on Western taxpayers to pay close attention. The letter also included a table estimating the number of votes that each side could get, believing that if 4,000 Western taxpayers voted for the five British candidates, they would get 20,000 votes, with each person getting an average of 4,000 votes, which would be enough to exceed the 3,700 votes that each Japanese candidate could get. If MacDonald is also included, then the number of British candidates would increase to six, and with six people dividing 20,000 votes, each person would only get about 3,333 votes. This number is obviously not able to compete with the Japanese.

Portuguese Support British and Americans

(2) In addition, a Portuguese taxpayer also sent a letter to the North-China Daily News yesterday, stating that he believes that the Portuguese should all vote for the British and American candidates to maintain the original state of the concession. He believes that the Portuguese in Shanghai and Hong Kong have been cooperating with the British and American side for half a century and have obtained their living conditions, so the Portuguese should be absolutely grateful to the British and American expatriates and hope to maintain the status quo. He continued to say that although they have no ill feelings towards the Japanese, they all want the administration of the concession to be maintained by British and American expatriates.

The Last Move in the Japanese Conspiracy

The China Critic Weekly published today stated that the Japanese statement that they will return the police power of Hongkou to the Municipal Council is just a trick by the Japanese to seize the administrative power of the concession. The Japanese can use this to break the traditional view that Hongkou is a "special situation" and allow every Japanese taxpayer, even those living in the Hongkou area, to have the opportunity to vote for Japanese candidates. The article believes that this move is actually the last move by the Japanese to seize the administration of the concession, but it will undoubtedly fail because the United States has taken an absolutely tough stance against it. If the American expatriates do not care about the administrative management power of the Municipal Council, then the Shanghai Concession will inevitably suffer the same fate as the Tianjin Concession. The article also believes that this move by the Japanese is a new posture under their consistent ambition for the concession.

### Two Assassinations Occurred Yesterday: Liu Fuxie and Huang Youfen Both Died - The Police Are Investigating the Reasons for the Attacks

Two assassinations occurred in the city yesterday, and both people died. The first occurred at 12:11 pm yesterday, and the deceased was Liu Fuxie, the deputy supervisor of the Public Works Bureau, who was shot at the corner of Chengdu Road and Weihaiwei Road. The second occurred at about 5:30 pm yesterday on Hualong Road in the French Concession, and the deceased was Huang Youfen, a former police officer of the Public Security Bureau. The details of the two cases are described below:

Liu Fuxie

A shooting occurred at the corner of Chengdu Road and Weihaiwei Road in the Public Concession at about 12:11 pm yesterday. The victim was Liu Fuxie, the deputy supervisor of the Public Works Bureau, who was shot three times in the head and died on the spot. The assailant abandoned his weapon and fled without a trace. The details are as follows:

Deputy Supervisor

Liu Fuxie was from Bao'an, Guangdong, and was 47 years old. He was tall and dignified. His wife, Ling, was 45 years old. He had three sons, all of whom were students. He lived in a small Western-style house at No. 21, Jinde Lane, No. 183 Chengdu Road. He had been the deputy supervisor of the Public Works Bureau on the Bund for ten years. He was previously assigned to work in the machine room of the Public Works Bureau in Zhanghuabang, Wusong. After the war, he was transferred back to the general bureau and assigned to work on the dredger at the Swire Dock. He had a very high monthly income and lived a prosperous life. Yesterday at about 12:00 pm, Liu was wearing a beige Western-style suit, gray flannel trousers, a wool vest, a white broadcloth shirt, a beige spring overcoat, yellow leather shoes, and a dark gray felt hat. After finishing his work at the bureau, he took the No. 14 bus on the Bund to return home for lunch.

Shot Three Times

Unexpectedly, when the bus arrived at the corner of Chengdu Road and Weihaiwei Road, and before he had taken a few steps after getting off, an assailant armed with a gun, who had been lying in wait there, saw Liu approaching and immediately pulled out his gun and fired several shots at Liu's head. He was shot three times, once below Liu's right ear and twice in the back of his neck. The bullets did not pass through. He immediately fell to the ground, and blood splattered everywhere. Seeing that his purpose had been achieved, the assailant abandoned his weapon on the road in front of No. 200 Chengdu Road and fled without a trace. At this time, pedestrians surrounded and watched, and the road was blocked. The Chengdu Road Police Station was nearby. Chinese and Western detectives heard the alarm and rushed to the scene, but the shooter had already fled far away. They only found a pistol and four empty cartridges discarded by the murderer on the road nearby and took them back to the police station for investigation. At the same time, they urgently summoned ambulance No. 83 and rushed Liu Fuxie, who had been injured, to Baolong Hospital for treatment. However, the injuries were too severe, and he had lost too much blood. He had already died on the way. At about 5:00 pm, the body was transferred from the hospital to the morgue to report to the court for examination. It was later learned that his eldest son, Weizhang, was studying at the Nantong Textile School, his second son, Zhuoyu, and his youngest son, Zhuoqiu, were both studying at Shanghai University. The house at No. 21 Jinde Lane was Liu's sole residence, and the interior was elegantly decorated. According to his relatives, Liu rarely socialized with the outside world except for work. His sudden assassination is really inexplicable. The police are paying great attention to this case and are investigating it. It is said that it may be related to politics.

Huang Youfen

A shooting occurred in front of the Jinjiang Tea House on Hualong Road in the French Concession at about 5:30 pm yesterday. The victim was a Sichuanese man named Huang Youfen, who was shot three times and seriously injured. He died before he could be treated. The assailant was arrested on the spot. The details are as follows:

Died from Three Shots

Huang Youfen was a Sichuanese man, 38 years old, who lived in a pavilion room on the second floor of No. 72 Tianzhutang Street in the French Concession, paying a monthly rent of 12 yuan for about three months. He was formerly a police officer in the Third District Branch of the Public Security Bureau. At about 5:30 pm yesterday, Huang, wearing a dark blue serge Zhongshan suit, was walking from north to south on Hualong Road in front of the Jinjiang Tea House at No. 70, when a person following him from behind, also wearing a black Zhongshan suit, pulled out a gun and shot him. He fired four shots, three of which hit him. One shot hit him in the chest, one in the abdomen, and one in the left waist. He was injured and fell to the ground, and blood splattered everywhere. Seeing that his purpose had been achieved, the assailant threw a red paper strip with the words "Ordered to carry out the execution" written on it beside him, and then fled to Gujia Lane across from Hualong Primary School.

The Murderer Was Captured

At that time, the two patrol officers of Hualong Primary School blew their whistles and followed closely behind. When crossing Luban Road and turning south onto Wangzhi Road and Malang Road, the assailant tried to call a streetcar to escape. At this time, the nearby patrol officers heard the alarm and arrived on the scene and arrested him on the spot. At the same time, they urgently summoned an ambulance and sent the victim to Guangci Hospital for treatment. They also found a pistol discarded by the murderer in Gujia Lane and immediately took it to the Lujiawan General Police Station. Under the preliminary interrogation by the police, he confessed that his surname was Lin, a local, and he admitted that he shot and assassinated Huang Youfen without denying it. Huang Youfen, who was injured, was sent to the hospital, but because the injuries were in vital parts, he died before he could be treated. The police sent the body to the morgue of the Industrial Bureau Hospital on Delastre Road, waiting for the court to send someone to examine the body today. The police are currently investigating the murderer's address, occupation, place of origin, and the reason for the victim's death.

### Ningbo Authorities Cable Shanghai to Discuss Foreign Vessels Handling Their Own Lighterage

The wartime Ningbo Shipping Administration of Zhejiang Province, based on a telegram from the Sanbei Company, intends to change to each vessel hiring its own lighters to prevent theft and leakage. Yesterday, they telegraphed the Shipping Industry Association to convene shippers as soon as possible to discuss and report. The order is recorded as follows: According to the telegram from Yu Qiaqing, manager of the Shanghai Sanbei Shipping Company, the Ningbo Lighterage Company was originally organized jointly by shippers, but because it has not been able to perform its duties properly, the fees are high, the management is poor, and there is theft and leakage along the way. Customers have negotiated, but no evidence is provided, and the losses are huge. Since the approval of shallow-water vessels to sail directly, passengers and goods can be directly loaded and unloaded at the Ningbo wharf, saving time and money, and reducing theft and accidental losses. As a result, passengers and goods are all loaded on direct-sailing vessels, and the business of large vessels outside the port has plummeted. The crux of the problem is the poor lighterage. Therefore, we respectfully request your approval to allow our company's vessels outside the port to hire their own lighters freely and handle the lighterage matters, without being restricted by the Ningbo Lighterage Company's patent, in order to maintain business and protect customers' losses. We are at your service, etc. The Ningbo Lighterage Company's poor management is indeed the case. Please convene all shippers as soon as possible to discuss and report for verification. Zhang Guiling, mid-afternoon secret.

### Danish and Norwegian Expatriates in Shanghai Are Concerned About the Turmoil in Their Homeland: The Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish Consulates Have Not Yet Received Any Instructions from Their Governments

According to foreign sources, since the news that Germany controlled Denmark and advanced into Norway, expatriates from the Scandinavian countries in the city have adopted a "wait and see" attitude towards the threat to their homeland. Telecommunications between Norway and Denmark and the Norwegian and Danish consulates in the city have been completely cut off. Only Sweden can still communicate. The consulates of the three countries jointly stated yesterday that because they have not received government instructions, they will all deal with it calmly. The consulates have not given any instructions to their expatriates in Shanghai, because they cannot take any measures on their own without government instructions. Due to the isolation of information, the consulates have also been unable to make any inferences about the development of the situation. The consulates declared that what they can know is the same as what is published in the city's newspapers. Currently, expatriates from the Scandinavian countries in the city are working hard to obtain more detailed reports and are waiting with great enthusiasm to see if they will be called up for military service. As for the shipping companies operated by Scandinavian merchants in the city, it was stated yesterday that they will continue to operate as usual until they receive any definite news.

### Forty Million Aluminum Subsidiary Coins Were Minted: The First Batch of Ten Million Coins Was Issued Yesterday - The Saying That the Fractional Currency Notes Will Be Temporarily Suspended Is Not True

The Shanghai Banking Association has been approved by the Ministry of Finance to issue aluminum subsidiary coins of 1-fen and 5-fen to relieve the shortage of fractional currency in the Shanghai market. After the minting began, the first batch of ten million coins arrived in Shanghai and were issued yesterday, circulating in the market. The second batch is about to arrive in Shanghai and will continue to be issued. The details are as follows:

Issued Yesterday and Circulating in the Market

The first batch of aluminum subsidiary coins approved by the Ministry of Finance to be minted, totaling ten million coins, worth 300,000 legal currency, including 5 million 1-fen coins, worth 50,000 yuan, and 5 million 5-fen coins, worth 250,000 yuan, arrived in Shanghai and were handed over to the Shanghai Banking Association for issuance. The association stipulated: (1) Member banks of the Banking Association will be distributed by the Banking Joint Reserve Committee; (2) Member banks of the Money Industry Association will be distributed by the Money Industry Joint Reserve; (3) Foreign commercial banks will be distributed by the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation. It has already started issuing and circulating in the market from 2:00 pm yesterday.

Each Bank Received Coins: Exquisite Style

The Banking Association's issuance of aluminum subsidiary coins stipulated that the four major banks, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Agricultural Bank of China, and the Central Bank of China, were each allowed to receive 10,000 yuan, and other banks and money houses were allowed to receive from 500 yuan to 2,000 yuan, depending on the business of each bank. The aluminum subsidiary coins are small and exquisite. Because of their light weight, they are very convenient to carry. The style of the 1-fen coin has the words "Republic of China Twenty-ninth Year" and "1 Fen" on the front, and a model of an ancient coin on the back. The 5-fen coin also has the words "Republic of China Twenty-ninth Year" and "5 Fen" on the front, and a model of an ancient coin on the back. Both the 1-fen and 5-fen coins have a circular border on the front and back.

The Second Batch Is About to Arrive: Continuous Issuance

A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency learned from the banking industry yesterday that the second batch of aluminum subsidiary coins, also totaling ten million coins, half 1-fen and half 5-fen, has been minted and will be shipped to Shanghai soon for the Banking Association to continue issuing. It is said that the third and fourth batches are being rushed to mint. Once they are minted, they will be shipped to Shanghai for issuance. The total is 40 million coins, shipped to Shanghai in four batches. Whether to continue minting after this will depend on the needs of the market in the future. It is also said that various industries have requested to receive the coins, and the Banking Association is currently considering it, but the first batch is specifically issued to the banks and money houses for redistribution and circulation.

The Decision to Continue Issuing Fractional Currency Notes

Regarding the 1-fen and 5-fen fractional currency notes previously issued by the Shanghai Branch of the Central Bank, 2.5 million legal currency has already been issued. It has now been decided to continue issuing them as needed by the market. The saying that the fractional currency notes will be temporarily suspended after the issuance of the aluminum subsidiary coins has been confirmed by a reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency to be untrue. The fractional currency notes and the aluminum subsidiary coins are both fully backed by legal currency, without any discount, and are used in the same way. After this, the shortage of subsidiary coins in the Shanghai market will be completely eliminated, and there will be no more shortage.

The Composition and Weight of the New Subsidiary Coins

Article 2 of the Revised Subsidiary Coin Regulations was promulgated on February 13, 1940. It stipulates the types of subsidiary coins as follows: 10-fen subsidiary coin, total weight 3 grams, composition: nickel 18, copper 55, zinc 27; 5-fen subsidiary coin, total weight 2 grams, composition: nickel 18, copper 55, zinc 27; 2-fen subsidiary coin, total weight 2 grams, composition: copper 65, zinc 35; 1-fen subsidiary coin, total weight 1.5 grams, composition: copper 65, zinc 35.

### Yesterday's Opening of the Appeal in the Parricide Case: Zhou Qinxiang Admits to Acting Alone, Zhou Qinji Retracts Confession, Denies Participation in Murder, Questions Raised About Their Ages, Mother Wrongfully Accused, Dissatisfaction with Forensic Report, Request for Re-examination

The case of Zhou Qinji and Zhou Qinxiang, two brothers from Ningbo, who killed their biological father, Zhou Yongjie, at No. 228 Meg Road, West Shanghai, on December 5th of last year, and then dismembered the body with their biological mother, Zhou Jing, using strong acid to dissolve it in an attempt to destroy the evidence, which was reported to the Jing'an Temple Police Station by the deceased's eldest daughter, Zhou Qinzhu, leading to the arrest of the mother and two sons and their transfer to the First Special Court, where the two unfilial sons were sentenced to death for murdering their parent, and Zhou Hong was sentenced to two years and six months of imprisonment for assisting in the dismemberment of the body, details of which were previously published in this newspaper, the three defendants, dissatisfied with the verdict, separately engaged Yang Zunzhi, Ye Shaoying, and Jiang Pingfan as lawyers to appeal to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court.

They argued that the two unfilial sons suffered from hereditary mental impairments. Therefore, the High Court first ordered the forensic doctors of the First Special Court to conduct a complete examination of the two unfilial sons. The forensic doctors prepared a report and submitted it to the High Court. Consequently, the presiding judge scheduled a hearing for yesterday afternoon. Currently, all civil and criminal cases of the Second Branch of the High Court are heard at the temporary court address on Weihaiwei Road and Chongqing Road. However, due to the gravity of this case, the number of attendees at the hearing was expected to be high. Given the limited space at that location, it was decided to temporarily use the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court on North Zhejiang Road for the trial. The hundred or so attendance tickets that were issued were quickly claimed. Therefore, by around 2:00 PM yesterday, the Second Criminal Court was packed, and a significant number of people without tickets were denied entry. At 2:40 PM, presiding Judge Nie Cheyi, along with associate Judges Shi Meiyu and Mai Zhensheng, Prosecutor Lin Wopeng, and the clerk,

took their seats to open the court.

The three appellants were first brought to the case. The Zhou Qinji and Zhou Qinxiang brothers wore the same gray long robes they wore when arrested last year, but they looked haggard. Zhou Jing wore a female prisoner's uniform with the number 390 pinned to the front. When Judge Nie first asked the three appellants about their ages, Qinji and Qinxiang suddenly changed the ages they had given during the first trial, from twenty-four and twenty-one years old respectively. Qinji now claimed to be twenty-one years old, and Qinxiang claimed to be only eighteen years old. To be cautious, Judge Nie adopted a separate interrogation approach. After ordering the three appellants to be temporarily detained, he first questioned Chen Renji, a witness for Zhou Jing, who was from Jurong (working as an inspector at the Customs, residing at No. 4, Tianlefang, Xieqiao Lane). He generally stated that the deceased had a strange and eccentric personality during his lifetime, and his relationship with his wife was very poor, with very little interaction even with relatives. He was particularly harsh on his two sons, often beating and scolding them, and even once stopped providing them with schooling. He also stated that Zhou Jing did indeed have heart disease. Whether his two sons had mental illness and the reason for killing their biological father, whether it was for property, he did not know. Then, Zhou Qinji was brought to the case to be questioned about the reasons for the appeal. Qinji suddenly overturned all the confessions he had made during the first trial, in which he admitted to killing his father with his brother and how they had destroyed the body to conceal the evidence. He claimed that he disagreed with the first instance judgment for

three reasons:

(1) My father's death was solely the act of my younger brother. I was unaware of it. At the time, the police wrongly accused me of being an accomplice. (2) The age issue. (3) My mother is truly innocent. During my father's lifetime, he treated my mother and us very poorly, causing us great suffering. On the night of December 5th last year, around 9:00 PM, Qinxiang went to sleep as usual. I also went to bed at 11:00 PM. In the middle of the night, I suddenly heard my brother walking around, which startled me awake. I saw my brother and asked him what was wrong. He said that he had killed our father by using an electric wire to shock his head, and he died instantly. I went to check and saw my father's body lying on the bed, his head and face covered with a blanket. I thought that since things had already come to this, I deeply considered burying the body, but because I had no money, I could not do it. So, I found my father's cash and passbook in the drawer. The next morning, I went to the French Park with my brother to discuss it. At that time, my brother also expressed his approval. Later, my brother wanted to buy something, so I gave him the money and let him go first. I did not return home until after 5:00 PM. I saw my brother had already returned and was dismembering my father's body on the balcony. The head and feet had already been cut off, and he was sawing off one leg. I asked my brother why he was doing this. He replied that because the body was too big, it had to be cut into smaller pieces before it could be packed and transported out. At that moment, we suddenly heard knocking on the door below. I asked who it was. He replied it was the police. We were greatly alarmed and I went downstairs to open the door and was arrested. This fact was solely the act of my brother. Because my sister, Qinzhua, was usually

quite compatible with me

but not with my brother, so at the time we discussed this matter at home, that it would be done jointly by me and my brother, so that Qinzhua would not report it to the police, etc. The court inquired in great detail about the Zhou family's housing conditions, lasting for a long time. Then, Western detective Naluofu testified that this case was reported to the police station by Zhou Qinzhua, and he led Chinese detectives to investigate the situation. When questioned by Zhou Qinxiang, he confessed that his father was murdered by him personally and had nothing to do with his brother. Because he usually liked to study radio engineering, he bought electric wires that day, etc., and his brother did not pay attention. At that time, he first inserted an electric wire into a plug, and when his father was sound asleep, he placed it on his temple. Fearing that he was not dead, he placed another lamp wire separately on his hands and feet. Although my father cried out at the time, his voice was very low. After my father died, he covered his head with a blanket and asked his brother to help carry the corpse to another small room. I lifted the head, and my brother lifted the feet. Then, I heard my mother calling. I went to my mother's room, and she asked me what was wrong. I replied that my father had been killed by me. My mother was greatly shocked upon hearing this, saying that killing your father is the same as killing me. Since things had come to this, I did not say much more. At this time, my sister also got up, and I discussed with her

the disposal of the body. The court asked, why did you kill your father? He replied, because my father treated my mother extremely poorly, often beating her, causing her great suffering, especially recently. He deliberately made things difficult for my mother. My mother had to eat porridge because she suffered heart disease, but my father would not allow it and insisted that she cook rice. He also deliberately turned on the radio, causing my mother to catch a cold, which would worsen her illness. Such things were countless. His treatment of my brothers and me was even worse. Not only did he beat us at will, but he also forbade us from studying, claiming that we were not his biological sons and, therefore, did not treat us as his own. Both of them also stated that their mother really did not know about it beforehand and was wronged. Then, Zhou Jing was brought to the case, stating that she was fifty years old this year and married the deceased at the age of twenty-four. Three years later, she gave birth to her eldest daughter, Qinzhua. The following year, she gave birth to Qinji, and three years later, she gave birth to Qinxiang. So, both sons were her own. She reiterated that she was abused by her husband, and her two sons could not bear to sit idly by, leading to this absurd disaster. She really did not know about it beforehand, and she was upstairs during the dismemberment, so she did not know either. When she spoke of her heartbreak, tears streamed down her face. All the male and female audience members in the court felt saddened by it. Finally, she said that this case

was destined

and was a calamity from a previous life. More than a month before the incident, her house was haunted by ghostly sounds all night long. She thought that she would soon die, but she did not expect this great change to occur. She also pointed out that her two sons were extremely intelligent, but they were misled by their intelligence. The court then ordered the informer, Yin Xiang, to be brought to the court. He was twenty-six years old, from Dong. He was questioned about his brother's age. He stated that Qinji was twenty-five years old, Yin Zhuan was twelve years old. Before the incident, he was hot. He was called by Yin Xiang, who said that father had already been killed. The body had been tied up with ropes, so he did not see it. But Li Brothers said that father was killed by both of them, and the body was also broken down by both of them. The relationship between his father and his brothers was always bad. In the middle, he once stopped them from studying. He also claimed that his mother, Zhou Jing, was being unfairly treated. Finally, the court summoned the tenant Xu Yuanzhang and Chen Jing, Zhou Jing's sister, for questioning. By then, the clock struck seven. The court stated that

the case was clear

and could begin the debate. However, the defendants' lawyers stated that they needed to sort out the defendants' testimonies today before they could prepare defense materials. They requested an investigation into the age issues of the two defendants because if Zhou Yinxiang was eighteen years old, he would not have been eighteen years old when the incident occurred last year. The statutory age was related to the case. Also, the appellants had traditional mental illnesses, and they could not determine the forensic report, deeming it unsatisfactory. They requested a re-examination. The court, after considering the situation, ordered that a separate request be submitted for the re-examination and be approved. It also ordered the Chinese detective in charge to go to Zhou Qinzhua's house with her after the court adjourned to search for the two defendants' graduation certificates or related documents to verify their ages. The case was adjourned to a later date for further questioning. The defendants were sent back to detention separately. The court adjourned at 7:30 PM.

### Tenants of the China Bank Building Refuse Rent Increase, Stalemate Continues

The tenants of the China Bank Building on Avenue Edward VII received a letter from the landlord in early February of this year, stating that rents would be increased by 10% to 50%. However, the tenants argued that it was difficult to make a living at this time, and they could not afford another rent increase. Moreover, the only reason given for the rent increase by several large buildings in the city was the soaring price of coal used for heating. Since the China Bank Building did not provide heating, the landlord's reason was insufficient. Therefore, they convened a meeting of tenants and asked the landlord to retract the order, but the landlord did not comply. Consequently, the matter has reached a stalemate. The landlord has not yet received the rent for March. Therefore, the tenants have decided to deposit the rent in court this week.

### False Police Illegally Arrest British Woman, Detained for as Long as Two Hours, Released After Police Intervention

Mrs. Vick, a British national, was arrested by "Avenue" police at 1:30 PM on the 9th on Avenue Edouard VII for careless driving, which resulted in hitting a bicycle. She was detained for as long as two hours before being released after intervention by the Shanghai Municipal Police. According to the Police report, the incident was caused by the cyclist obstructing her path. While Mrs. Vick offered assistance to the injured cyclist, a "Avenue" police patrol came to the scene. She was taken to the Route Ghisi Detachment.  The Police Department reported to Jing'an Temple Police Station. After two hours of debate, Mrs. Vick paid five dollars to settle the matter.

According to the order, the manufacture, transportation, storage, and use of opium and all narcotics are prohibited. Therefore, the French Police has intensified its search for drugs.

### Counterfeiting Whiskey, Appeal to Reduce Fine

Public prosecution was initiated for harming agriculture, industry, and commerce. Judge Qiu Huanxiang sentenced Zhang Bingyao to a fine of 1,200 yuan and Zhu Jianwei to a fine of 1,000 yuan for assistance.

### Rummaging Through Old Newspapers Sixty-Seven Years Ago (351)

(From This Newspaper in the Twelfth Year of Tongzhi, Qing Dynasty)

The Situation in Burma

Burma is a small country among the islands of Southeast Asia. It is neighbored by Yunnan, Bengal, and India, and is eyed covetously by major powers such as Russia and England. They are constantly watching it from the sidelines. Although it pays tribute to China, China's reach is limited and cannot provide timely assistance. How should it be cautious, self-reliant, and unite with friendly nations while resisting the schemes of strong neighbors? It is rumored that after the new king of Burma ascended the throne, he became tyrannical, cruel, and reckless, without any sense of governance. He treats national affairs as a game, and the ancestral heritage is in danger of falling. The Book of Documents says: "Calamities sent by Heaven may be avoided, but those caused by oneself cannot." Mencius said: "A state must first smite itself before others smite it." Now, the Burmese king has no one to smite him, but he is willing to inflict calamity upon himself and invite others to smite him. How can his misfortune be far off? Generally, the survival of a small country depends entirely on precise internal governance, leaving no gap for others to exploit, so that it can resist foreign insults. In the past, the state of Zheng in the Eastern Zhou Dynasty, as a weak state sandwiched between the two major powers of Jin and Chu, delivered sacrifices and jade to both states, and its situation was precarious. However, the state, though weak, could not be destroyed because of Zichan's reforms, which maintained the overall situation and established the foundation of the state. Qin Shi Huang and Sui Yangdi, with the dignity of emperors and the unification of the world, were admired and feared by everyone. However, Qin Shi Huang's burning of books and burying of scholars led to resentment, and Chen Sheng's uprising was supported by the world. The solidity of Hangu Pass could not be relied upon, and the power of the First Emperor could not be restored. Emperor Yang of Sui, relying on his predecessors' legacy, indulged in his desires, and bandits rose up, leading to the country's demise. What they relied on was surely greater than what Burma relies on, but it ultimately could not save them from destruction. It is clear that the gathering and dispersal of people's hearts is related to the rise and fall of the state, which is not a superficial matter. Ancient people say, "The people do not constantly cherish, but cherish those with benevolence." These are good words.

### Crime is a Disease

By Huang Jiayin

Today, the advanced judicial systems of Western civilized countries have embarked on a new and rational path.

In European and American countries, judges, prison officers, psychiatrists, psychological experts, and criminologists have formed an unbreakable chain. Their attitude towards handling criminal cases is scientific, researched, and analytical, rather than speculative and conjectural.

They view crime as a disease, a social disease, a mental disease. They are the doctors treating this criminal disease, and their purpose is to diagnose and cure.

Therefore, the new judicial approach to crime is educational, instructive, and transformative. Condemning, punitive, and retaliatory justice has gradually been eliminated by the times.

China is relatively backward in science, but our judicial authorities should still make the most of the scientific tools we have to study and analyze criminal cases. In this way, we hope to achieve a fairer and more reasonable judgment in cases large and small.

### The American Parricide Case

— Jin Chun

Recently, a parricide case occurred in Shanghai, causing a sensation for a time. Now, seeing that similar incidents are happening in the United States, it is clear that this is a serious social problem. However, beyond uttering the clichéd phrases "the world is going to the dogs, people's hearts are no longer as they used to be" and putting on a show of "their wickedness has reached its limit, satisfying the hearts of the people," it seems there should be a proactive solution.

In the United States, there were two boys who would kill their own fathers. One was only twelve years old at the time, and the other was fifteen. The twelve-year-old saw his father, drunk, beating his mother, and wanting to save his mother, he drew a gun and shot his father dead. As for the fifteen-year-old, he loved his mother and older sister very much, and he also loved his father, but at the same time, he couldn't help but hate him, because his father was in love with another woman. One Saturday, he went to his father and begged him to come home. His father agreed, saying he would definitely be back for dinner on Sunday. The boy was overjoyed when he heard this and ran home, skipping and jumping. He helped his mother and sister tidy the room, helped them arrange and decorate, and helped them plan and prepare for the next day's dinner.

The next day, Sunday afternoon, every five minutes he would run to the door and look down the street. Every few minutes, his mother would look in the mirror and then check the stove. Every few minutes, his sister would light the candles on the table, pause, and then blow them out again.

Later, they knew that Dad wasn't coming home that night.

The mother threw herself on the bed and couldn't help but cry bitterly, and the older sister also sobbed uncontrollably in her room.

The boy secretly took his father's gun and slipped out, heading towards the bar. "He asked from outside the window, 'Dad, are you planning to come home?'"

The father laughed loudly and said, "I'm not going back."

The boy opened fire, shooting his father dead with one shot. He went straight home and waited for the police to arrive and arrest him. He confessed to the crime of parricide, but as a prosecutor was about to pass sentence, a Catholic priest, Father Leonard, suddenly intervened.

He said, "The reason why this child committed the crime is because he loves his mother. This problem is too big, too complex, this problem is not something that a child of this young age can solve. And the motive that drove him to commit the crime is completely beyond the child's control. You can't blame this child."

He then cited the "Boys Town" he founded as evidence, Boys Town being dedicated to educating and nurturing homeless children and problem children. He asked the court for custody of the boy, guaranteeing that he could make him a respectable citizen.

The boy's mother couldn't help but cry with emotion when she heard the priest's defense, and the audience was so moved that they lost control, cheering and weeping alternately. The judge couldn't stop the crowd from revealing their feelings, and he himself was deeply moved.

### Examination of Mental Abnormality

— Huang Jiade

According to the research of modern psychologists, there is a very close relationship between crime and mental abnormality. Therefore, when some criminals are tried, they must undergo a mental abnormality examination so that the judge's judgment can obtain a reasonable and just basis. When modern psychiatry experts examine criminals, they usually start with family history, personal history, medical history, physical examination, neurological examination, and mental examination. The examination situation in these six aspects is briefly described as follows:

(1) Family History—The investigation of family history is an extremely important task. The examiner must try to investigate whether the criminal's ancestors have suffered from mental, neurological, or physical illnesses. This fact can be obtained from the criminal's relatives and friends, or teachers or officials who supervised him, or the criminal himself. However, the criminal's relatives may deliberately deceive and obscure the facts for the sake of the family's reputation, and at the same time, the criminal himself may not be able to make accurate reports due to mental abnormalities. This point should be paid special attention to. Regarding this aspect, the most important thing is to investigate whether his parents, grandparents, or collateral relatives have suffered from madness, neuropathy, alcoholism, lung disease, venereal disease, arthritis, or other physical illnesses, whether they have had narcotic drug addictions, or whether they have had criminal or suicidal behavior. These facts are extremely related to the criminal's background and environment.

(2) Personal History—The examination of personal history must begin from the time the criminal was not yet born. When he was conceived, did his parents suffer from physical illnesses; when he was born, did his mother suffer from the pain of difficult labor? What was his childhood life like, when did he start school, what were his grades like, did he ever drink alcohol or take narcotics, and did he ever suffer from venereal disease? What were his sexual habits like, did he suffer from masturbation or have improper sexual relations? Was his married life happy? (Some facts, of course, are not easily obtained.) The examiner can know the general situation of the criminal's mental structure, personality, and living environment from these facts.

(3) Medical History—The examiner must try to find out how the criminal's illness was caused. Before committing the crime, did he suffer any major physical or mental stimulation or blows? Was his behavior abnormal? He may have suffered from insomnia, poor appetite, depression, memory loss, or he may have wanted to commit suicide or murder. He may have felt that he could not adapt to the environment. This fact is very related to the cause of the crime, so it should be recorded in detail.

(4) Physical Examination—When experts examine the criminal's body, they can know whether he is depressed, happy, suspicious, irritable, combative, or whether he has a hostile attitude. Are his movements agile, accurate, purposeful, or slow, suppressed, aimless? His appearance and attitude in conversation can also often reveal his mental state. In addition, the structure of various parts of the body, the digestive system, the respiratory system, the circulatory system, the glandular system, and the current state of reproductive and urinary functions must also be paid attention to. It is also essential to thoroughly examine whether the criminal suffers from serious diseases such as diabetes, lung disease, venereal disease, gonorrhea, metal poisoning, or syphilis.

(5) Neurological Examination—Regarding this aspect, experts pay attention to the criminal's neurological state, how his eyes move, how the nervous system reacts in various parts of the body, how the muscles move, how the skin generally feels in various parts, how the five senses function, how the internal organs react, what his language and writing skills are like, and whether he has suffered from convulsions, etc.

(6) Mental Examination—The purpose of mental examination is to find out whether the criminal has had disturbances in consciousness, whether he has had hallucinations or delusions, whether his feelings, judgment, or understanding have been confused, whether his attention and memory have declined, whether his thoughts are disordered, whether his emotions are abnormal, and whether his willpower has been impaired, because these phenomena will directly affect the criminal's behavior. This examination must be very thorough and very detailed. If possible, the criminal's answers must be recorded for reference. The examiner must first make detailed considerations of the criminal's educational level and life experience before determining his mental state. This type of examination is very helpful for the reasonable judgment of the case.

Psychology

### Madness and Crime

— Luo Daoai

Among all kinds of criminals, the number of the insane accounts for a considerable proportion. The criminal behavior of the insane is often not easy to distinguish from the criminal behavior of ordinary people, because in addition to studying the fundamental motive of the crime, ordinary external behavior is not enough to be the standard for determining the insane and ordinary people. People with mental disorders sometimes show considerable skill and wisdom in their criminal behavior, and it looks like a deliberate and planned action, so they are regarded as mentally sound criminals. He may also deliberately mystify and try to cover up his criminal behavior in order to evade responsibility and punishment. However, this is his instinctive behavior to preserve himself, and we should not use this as a reason to prove that his spirit is absolutely sound.

Epilepsy is one of the most important causes of pathological criminal behavior. According to the examination results of prison doctors, the majority of criminals with mental illness suffer from epilepsy. Some epileptics appear to be fully conscious when committing crimes, but in fact, his consciousness is almost completely lost; when he returns to his normal mental state, he completely cannot remember the behavior he has done. In addition to epilepsy, the most common mental illnesses suffered by criminals are early-onset dementia, partial paralysis, depressive insanity, hysterical insanity, postpartum insanity, senile neurological disorder, brain syphilis, narcotic neurological disorder, and idiocy.

The criminal behavior of the insane is mostly targeted at people. According to experts' surveys, there are three times more murderers among criminals suffering from madness than ordinary criminals, and there are one to one and a half times more offenders of rape, sodomy, and incest than ordinary criminals. The authorities of the Indiana State Prison in the United States have compiled the criminal behavior of 2,265 prisoners as follows:

Those who committed murder...5.3 percent

Those who committed rape, sodomy, and incest...6.1 percent

Those who committed murder and rape...14.6 percent

Those who committed petty theft...53.2 percent

Among the criminals suffering from insanity:

Those who committed murder...16.6 percent

Those who committed rape, sodomy, and incest...9.8 percent

Those who committed murder and rape...30.5 percent

Those who committed petty theft...37.7 percent

It can be seen that the majority of criminals suffering from madness are targeted at people. This makes us know that criminals suffering from madness must be kept in isolated confinement.

### Attacking the World of Anopheles Mosquitoes M.Chin.172

The world of Anopheles mosquitoes is not a figment of novelists' imaginations, but truly exists among humans, and its power is often vast, sacrificing the lives of 350 million people every year, and the losses it adds to industry and commerce are even more insignificant. Therefore, people from various countries in the world feel compelled to rise up and try to eliminate this harmful creature.

Anopheles mosquitoes often carry out their terrifying work in the darkness, and their power lies in a substance invisible to the naked eye, but part of the reason they can be so rampant is also due to the general public's lack of knowledge.

Although the secret of Anopheles mosquitoes was discovered by the Englishman Ross in the nineteenth century, their evil power has not yet been eliminated. Anopheles mosquitoes are cruel by nature, and whether rich or poor, scholars, farmers, workers, or merchants, men, women, old or young, or those who believe in Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, or Brahmanism, can hardly escape once they fall into their hands. Moreover, Anopheles mosquitoes are scattered all over the world, and wherever they go, they first carry malaria themselves, and when humans are bitten by them, they are also infected.

According to reports, 80 million people suffer from malaria every year, which proves that Anopheles mosquitoes are indeed one of the greatest enemies of mankind. Fortunately, the League of Nations is assisting people all over the world in eradicating mosquitoes, and its method is to make the public aware of the efficacy of quinine in treating malaria. The League of Nations Malaria Committee advocates taking six grains of quinine daily during the epidemic period to prevent it, and taking fifteen to twenty grains of quinine daily for five to six to seven days after being infected with malaria. Page 124 of the Malaria Committee's 1938 report specifically points out that quinine is safe and harmless, and ordinary people can use it without the supervision of a doctor, while comprehensive medicines cannot be used without the supervision of a doctor.

After using the above methods, the harm of Anopheles mosquitoes is limited. If there were no quinine, a magic drug for treating malaria, humans would be arbitrarily ravaged by Anopheles mosquitoes and would be left to die, it can be asserted.

### Jesus and the Unemployed (1)

I have often heard people say that Jesus' teachings are no longer in line with the times and cannot be applied to the circumstances of this era. Jesus lived in a frugal rural culture, and even if there were any social problems at that time, they did not go beyond the scope of villages or small towns. If the problems were not completely solved, neighbors helped each other to deal with them. But today, the situation is very different. Our social problems are national, and some of them have become world problems. Because the handicrafts of the past have been replaced by machine industry and mass production, in addition, there are various other changes. Even so, when it comes down to it, modern social problems are only different in size from the Galilean social problems that Jesus knew, but there is no difference in nature. To put it bluntly, they are still some old problems. We can see from the parable in Matthew 20:1-16 that Jesus and his disciples were already familiar with the problem of unemployment in that simple society. In this parable, Jesus did not suggest how to deal with the problem of unemployment. That was not what he was thinking about. He used this unemployment problem to interpret other greater things. In the parable, he talked about God's justice, which undoubtedly wanted the world to treat each other with justice. He unintentionally expressed his feelings about unemployment. It's just that his main meaning is not to see this problem as an economic problem, but as a humanitarian problem. We have a different view from him. We regard it as an economic problem. So our plan, B, is to use charity to solve it. Jesus put the humanitarian purpose first, and the economic problem must adapt to the humanitarian needs. If Jesus were alive today, I think his concept must be: people should not adapt to the economic system, but the economic system should adapt to people. In this way, the problem of unemployment, in Jesus' eyes, is of course first a humanitarian problem. Anyone who knows the plight of unemployment holds this view. When unemployment panic occurred in various countries, the various facts of the fall of the people were everywhere. Very good people, because their furniture was sent to the pawnshop piece by piece, sank into despair; the unemployed, because they have been idle for too long, have become unable to work; their hearts have been stimulated and broken by the hunger of their wives and children. So, they felt a great anger in their hearts and opposed the current social system. If we were there, we would naturally feel that we were living in a world of madmen. The people are the vitality of the country, and the current social system is sitting idly by and watching this vitality decline. This is something that urgently needs to be improved. I am not an economist. I don’t know if this cycle of rise and fall can be eliminated. However, I myself think that such things can be avoided. People have such wisdom and should have such social vision, and at least they must alleviate these reactionary tensions. For example, use unemployment insurance to prevent it. Protecting the vitality of a country—the great cause of the people—should not be done casually by private or semi-private charity work, nor should those who are unemployed through no fault of their own be allowed to accept the humiliation of private or public charity.

### Lin Yutang Promotes Ethics and Morality

— Hai Xing

Returning to China next month and transferring to the inland

Mr. Lin Yutang, a famous Chinese scholar, will return to China from the United States in mid-next month. He is scheduled to go to Hong Kong first, and then transfer to the inland. Lin Hanlu, the editor of "Cosmic Wind" sponsored by him, will go to Hong Kong from Shanghai to meet him. Some cultural figures in Hong Kong also plan to prepare a welcome. It is reported that when Lin Yutang gave speeches to overseas Chinese in the United States, he greatly promoted the ethics and morality of our country. Lin said: "When overseas Chinese are abroad, they often see the development of foreign material civilization, which is beyond the reach of our country, and they are most likely to develop a sense of inferiority. They do not know that Eastern civilization inherently has something that Westerners cannot match and are admired by them, which is the Chinese way of ethics and morality. For thousands of years in China, the most refined and greatest contribution has been the philosophy of ethics and morality, which, in simple terms, is the way to be a human being. Our people have a deep understanding of this kind of truth, and they are particularly strong in practice. Seeing that our overseas Chinese are always known for their honesty and virtue in the world, and are unwilling to violate local laws, Westerners have said that "Although there are many overseas Chinese in New York, they do not spend a penny on the police." A Westerner also said, "Chinese people from top to bottom are all civilized gentlemen." From this point of view, what Westerners know about our country is this way of being a human being. Overseas Chinese can give full play to this kind of virtue when they are dealing with Westerners in foreign countries. No wonder Westerners are pleased, and the overseas Chinese have made a great contribution to the cultural promotion of our country."

### Jin Suqin Will Return to Shanghai

Jin Suqin went to Hong Kong for more than half a month. She was originally scheduled to perform at the Lee Theater on the 12th, but now it has been cancelled. This news was confirmed by Suqin's own letter. Her original letter had the following paragraphs: The first batch of actors at the Hong Kong Lee Theater have been on stage for more than 10 days, and the box office is not good. It is estimated that they will lose about 6,000 to 7,000 Hong Kong dollars. Moreover, the team is not complete. Many scripts cannot be performed. If they are hired in Shanghai, then time is not allowed. Hong Kong Peking Opera audiences are limited to ordinary Shanghainese, as well as a small number of Cantonese people (curious and interested in drama, or Cantonese people who have lived in Shanghai for a long time.) There are two main reasons above, so I am afraid that the prediction of the performance results in Hong Kong cannot reach the ideal perfection. The lessons of the past make me extraordinarily lack courage...

Since I am not performing in Hong Kong, I will stay for a few days and then return to Shanghai. I am now living in Happy Valley. The literal translation of the English name is "Happy Valley," but I don't feel happy.

### Hong Jingling Knocks Out His Front Teeth

— Xiao Zai

Hong Jingling was an old man in the film department of the Commercial Press in those years. He has been making movies for nearly 30 years, and half of his hair is gray, but he was unfortunately knocked out of two front teeth by Gu Lanjun in his recent work "Huang Tianba". Because there was a scene where Gu Lanjun held a steel knife in her hand, and because she hated Lan Tianbao (played by Hong Jingling) for provoking and ruining the marriage, she swung a knife at him. Hong Jingling retreated backwards, a little slower, and Gu Lanjun's move was a little faster. The knife hit Hong Jingling's mouth! Two front teeth immediately fell out. Although this scene was successfully filmed, Hong Jingling sacrificed too much. Hong said to people afterwards: "I have lived to this age, and I still have this disaster!"

### Betty Davis' Impression of "Hollywood"

— Da Ni

Do you think it's easy to make friends in Hollywood? That's completely wrong. I have a total of three friends in Hollywood, and none of them are in the film industry.

In terms of career, Hollywood gives me amazing satisfaction; in terms of personality, she has also increased my "courage" and "patience"

There is a saying that you can often hear in Hollywood: "Is she a lovely woman?" I think this is the biggest insult.

The worst thing is: you can't always completely insist on your own ideas in Hollywood. For example: I used to swear not to bleach my hair, but now I have; I also swore not to wear suspenders, but later I wore them, and I continue to wear them now.

Hollywood has also changed my "outlook on life." In the past, I only knew how to enjoy myself. Now, I am willing to spend some time using my brain to think.

### Unofficial Records of the Pear Garden (Opera World)

— Xu Muyun

Ma Lianliang's Square Flags in "Mount Litong" (Continued)

Since Lianliang claims that the script of "Mount Litong" was obtained from the Duke Yansheng's Mansion, and is the original version of the Anhui opera, and the flag shape is square, then all Anhui operas are the ancestors of Peking opera. Why not increase the four flags to eight, making up the grandeur of eight directions (eight square flags) and the eight sides (eight flags) of the great general? If so, it would feel even more novel and coincidental. Restoring the past only reaches halfway, and the courage is not yet full. Moreover, what he calls the dragon-tiger armor is neither dragon above tiger below, nor dragon on the left and tiger on the right, nor dragon on the front and tiger on the back. It's just that he has a dragon and a tiger embroidered on the abdomen of the armor. To call it dragon-tiger armor with this is rather far-fetched. Moreover, it has always been customary to embroider a tiger's head in the middle of the abdomen of the armor, which represents the bravery of a military general, similar to the meaning of tiger, leopard, lion, and elephant. Furthermore, the colors of theatrical costumes and embroidered patches are often yellow, purple, red, blue, and black to determine the rank and status, and cranes, chickens, peacocks, geese, and silver pheasants are embroidered (first-rank immortal crane, second-rank brocade chicken, third-rank peacock, fourth-rank cloud goose, fifth-rank white silver pheasant). These patterns are used to distinguish the levels of hierarchy. If the position of a character in the play is not as high as a king or emperor, he must not use the dragon pattern (mainly embroidered with silver thread, only the emperor can embroider a gold dragon). In the past, the rules in the south were extremely strict, but now most do not follow the old system. Also, the patterns on the armor are mostly in the shape of fish scales to symbolize the meaning of iron leaves, but now they are also changed at will. However, no matter what, it has always been seen that the dragon and tiger are embroidered on the abdomen of the armor at the same time. Now, Ma Lianliang especially uses this to show off, which is truly what is called neither dragon nor tiger, neither donkey nor horse. Coupled with the fact that Lianliang is not good at wearing armor, and his feet have no roots, he especially feels that the square flags are clumsy and inflexible. I say that he does not know how to conceal his shortcomings, and it is for this reason.
