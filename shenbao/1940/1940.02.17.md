Guangzhou: Reuters has learned from reliable sources that the Japanese authorities here are currently considering a proposal from British businesses to improve the convenience of the Guangzhou docks. It is said that this proposal advocates that British ships sailing from Hong Kong be allowed to sail upstream along the Pearl River and dock at the various wharves of the Shipping Bureau, restoring the situation before the fall of Guangzhou. Although part of the Pearl River has been open for a year, transport ships are still not allowed to dock along the riverbank. Passengers on board, both Chinese and foreign, must be transported from the docks to Shamian. This is inconvenient for passengers, the Shamian Concession, and the Japanese authorities. This is because an average of a thousand Chinese passengers come to Guangzhou every week, first arriving in Shamian and then entering the city of Guangzhou through the British bridge, often causing disturbances and congestion. Furthermore, passengers are inspected at the dock and then inspected again by Japanese sentries outside the British bridge, repeating the same procedure. This is also considered troublesome by the Japanese. Although the British proposal is still under consideration and negotiations have not yet begun, as far as Reuters knows, there is considerable hope that the Japanese authorities will improve the convenience of the docks.

Editorial

### Speculation Creates Today's Prices

The sharp and unparalleled rise in prices this spring has surprised many. They do not know that this is a plan by speculators before the settlement period. Some doubt this claim, wondering how speculators could organize with such agility and such great power, responding in unison and raising prices to such heights. But one must remember that today's speculators are all about "winning money to gamble," so they often risk everything on a single throw. Last winter, many stocked up goods for the new year, preparing for a big rise in prices during the spring market. They started by fabricating various rumors to confuse people and make everyone believe that prices would inevitably rise. Then, as long as the price of gold rose, they could follow like clouds following dragons and winds following tigers. Sure enough, when the spring market opened, the exchange rate was still loose, but the price of gold rose sharply. However, the externally strong but internally weak gold market was not enough to stimulate the interest of the speculative market. Therefore, in recent days, they have been working on both the exchange rate and gold markets. As a result, all industries and markets are controlled by speculators and lose their autonomy. In the few days since the Spring Festival market opened, no matter what goods, profits of two or three cents per unit were easily obtained. In addition, last year, the profits of various industries ranged from over ten million to several million or hundreds of thousands. With such exorbitant profits, how could one not create the power of speculators, making speculators even more excited and those who do not speculate also want to get involved, leading to today's situation where the entire market has become a speculative frenzy? However, this is also caused by the deteriorating environment and the chaotic situation.

This surge in prices cannot be explained by normal theories, and the psychology of speculators cannot be moved by interests. What is the use of simply calling for market adjustments and price stabilization? It is also impossible to expect them in the current situation. Does this mean that prices will continue to rise like a kite with a broken string? In today's situation, this may unfortunately become a reality. Then, will those who are law-abiding, do not manipulate, do not speculate, earn rewards through labor, and rely on wages to make a living be sacrificed by speculators? This is already the case in reality. However, people can adapt to the environment, and they can also improve the environment. In Shanghai as a whole, the speculators' manipulation this time is either based on evil forces or on the chaotic situation. They use their wealth and business skills to exploit the majority of people. This is one point. Moreover, the rise in prices this time is not entirely due to an increase in consumption, but hoarding is the main reason. The hoarded goods still exist and will eventually circulate in the market and be consumed by consumers. This is the second point. Therefore, the majority of people whose lives are oppressed, understand the psychology of speculators, which is beneficial to temporary storage but not to long-term storage. Over time, market changes become unpredictable, and interest and warehouse rent losses become unavoidable. Therefore, they often take advantage of temporary public panic to stir up trouble, relying on their agile capital to buy cheap and sell dear, harming the community. However, if they lose their reliance or support, they will come with their heads held high but leave with their tails between their legs. This is to be expected. For example, in the oil market last winter, when there were rumors that Dalian oil was coming to Shanghai, prices immediately dropped by more than ten yuan, and there were still few buyers. This spring, prices rose by sixteen yuan, and people were still vying to buy. It's not that there is no oil, it's just that people's sentiments are different. Then, how do we know that the goods hoarded by speculators today will not one day be available for sale when transportation is restored? Moreover, the natural result of skyrocketing prices will lead to a sudden decrease in general consumption, such as factories and boiled water businesses stopping operations due to the high cost of coal. From this perspective, giving speculators a blow depends on the resilience of consumers!

To stabilize prices, the active aspect lies in adjusting supply and demand and corresponding production and sales. This can be discussed in normal times but cannot be sought in times of chaos. The passive aspect is to naturally save due to the habit of expensive goods. Thrift is originally a virtue, but in the environment of Shanghai, it may be considered stingy or pedantic. However, even middle-class families today may not be able to survive without thrift. Thrift means limiting consumption and reducing purchasing power. From the standpoint of producers, this is not a good sign. However, to cope with rising prices and rampant speculation, without doing so, it would be creating opportunities for them! I have heard about the living conditions of the Japanese. Due to the exhaustion of hydropower and the lack of coal reserves, they have had to reduce electricity supply. As a result, every household is using candles instead of electricity. Tap water is only available for two hours a day, and everyone is saving on water. Due to poor rice harvests, they are forced to save on lunch and not eat too much, replacing it with potatoes and other fruits. Even for something as small as matches, because their materials can be used to make ammunition, they are limiting each person to four matches per day. All of this has been mentioned in questions in the Japanese Diet, so it is not without reason. Because they are affected by the war, their economy is exhausted, and they have no choice but to implement extreme austerity. Other countries at war, such as Britain and France, are also advocating thrift so that all their material and financial resources can be used for the war and to win the final victory. But looking back at the lives of the people in Shanghai, they are still extravagant and wasteful, as if today's prosperity and superficial wealth are something that can be enjoyed for a long time. They do not realize that the result of waste will eventually be a day when they have nothing to rely on. Therefore, even without the surge in prices, they should be thrifty. Moreover, today, due to the manipulation of speculators, prices are soaring, posing a serious threat to general life. This is something that no one can deny. Speculators only know how to harm others for their own benefit and disregard the lives of their compatriots. The authorities are at a loss to stop speculation. Therefore, if ordinary people do not make plans early and reduce their standard of living as much as possible, and continue to enjoy themselves as usual, they will not only fail to crush the arrogance of speculators, but they may also fall into the trap of speculators and become sacrifices. This should start from each individual, creating a culture of thrift, not being ashamed to wear patched clothes, and not changing their happiness despite eating meager meals. If this is considered impractical, if prices continue to rise without change, there will eventually be an unfortunate day when this comes true.

### Japan Hopes to Resolve U.S. Issues; Tokyo Talks to Resume; U.S. Anti-Japan Movement Deep-Rooted; Arita Warns Japanese Not to Be Optimistic; Hull Says He Has Not Heard of Japan Protesting Loans to China

Washington: According to usually reliable Japanese sources yesterday, the resumption of the Yangtze River may be implemented on March 1. At the same time, Japanese sources outlined the following three future developments, which they say could ease tensions between the U.S. and Japan: (1) Japanese-U.S. diplomatic talks in Tokyo will resume in two or three weeks to resolve disputes between the two countries caused by the China issue. (2) Progress is expected in handling various loss claims made by the United States. (3) The U.S. Senate will indefinitely postpone considering bills to impose embargoes on Japan. According to news obtained from a certain Japanese source, the Japanese government has agreed to reopen the Yangtze River. It believes that implementation will take two months. Although this is considered too optimistic, judging from the current situation, the reopening of the Yangtze River may be implemented in early March. It is reported that the Japanese side will allow navigation to Nanjing. Regarding regulations for foreign ships, the Japanese side will adopt the most tolerant approach. Foreign Minister Arita Hachiro will resume the Tokyo talks after attending the plenary session of the Diet's Budget Committee. Japan believes that the U.S. Senate's postponement of considering the embargo issue is beneficial to U.S.-Japan relations, as the embargo bill is unlikely to be enacted for a considerable period of time. Although discussions on the embargo issue may resume at any time, fair observers here believe that the State Department has warned the Senate Foreign Relations Committee against taking early embargo action against Japan. (United Press telegram on the 16th)

Tokyo: "The Hochi Shimbun stated in an article today that the U.S. Congress's decision to postpone considering the embargo on Japan can only prevent the breakdown of Japanese-U.S. relations. The U.S. Congress passing an embargo bill against Japan would inevitably provoke Japanese retaliation, namely, abolishing the Nine-Power Treaty and declaring war on China. The newspaper called on the United States to reconsider its naval expansion program so that U.S.-Japan relations could be clarified. (United Press telegram on the 16th)

Tokyo: Foreign Minister Arita stated in the House of Representatives today in response to a question about the anti-Japanese embargo bill currently before the U.S. Congress, expressing hope that the United States will recognize that large-scale warfare is still taking place in China, and revise its demands on Japan. He also said that due to Japan's reaction and the situation in Europe, the bill may be postponed for discussion. However, the Japanese should not be optimistic about it, as the anti-Japanese embargo movement in the United States has deep roots and is widespread, with a large number of supporters. In addition, the forces of the environment must also be considered. The Foreign Minister was referred to, stating that the anti-Japanese embargo movement in the United States also has a considerable possibility of eventually disappearing, especially because there are quite a few farsighted people in the United States. In short, the Japanese government intends to resolve all outstanding issues with the United States as much as possible. A certain Diet member then spoke, saying that in view of the tense relations between Japan and the United States, the government should be urged to take forceful steps to store liquid fuel. Commerce Minister Fujiwara replied that the government has already prepared a concrete plan to cope with any situation caused by the United States prohibiting the export of oil to Japan, but it is difficult to release details. The Commerce Minister has assured the Diet member that preparations for the worst-case scenario have been completed. (Reuters telegram on the 16th)

Tokyo: Arita admitted in the House of Representatives Budget Committee today that it is very difficult for Japan and the United States to conclude a new commercial treaty, but to give up hope of concluding a new commercial treaty would also be unwise. Therefore, the only way forward at the moment is to try to prevent the current situation between the two countries from deteriorating further. (United Press telegram on the 16th)

Washington: Secretary of State Hull made a statement to the press stating that the State Department has not heard of rumors that Japan would protest if the United States were to provide further credit to China. (Havas telegram on the 15th)

Chongqing: The Central Daily News commented on the United States' continued loans to China today, stating that this action by the United States is sufficient to prove its determination to uphold justice, fairness, the rule of law, and its traditional Far Eastern policy. Of course, the Chinese people are deeply grateful for this attitude of the United States. The Chinese people have always known that the United States is a friend in need. The report concluded that various forms of assistance from friendly countries to China will strengthen the Chinese people's determination to continue fighting Japan.

### Japanese House of Representatives Continues Budget Debate; Hata Shunroku Reports on Military Reorganization

Tokyo: When the House of Representatives continued the budget debate today, discussions were held on issues such as the army's military reorganization plan, expanding industrial output, organizing an independent air force, and aiding China's "new central government." Lieutenant General Yanagawa, Secretary-General of the House of Representatives, declared that if the war continues for a long time, the Japanese army will have to provide the "new central government" of China with military, political, and economic assistance, but this assistance is intended to enable the new regime to become self-reliant as soon as possible. Yanagawa also agreed to do his best to maintain the value of Japanese military scrip circulating in China. Naval Minister Yoshida said that the Navy has no intention of making the naval air force independent. Army Minister Hata Shunroku said in response to a question from a certain Diet member that the military reorganization plan was formulated based on the situation in 1937, but the outbreak of the China incident and the changes in the international situation have made it necessary to revise this plan. He expects that this plan will be fully implemented by 1943, or at the latest by 1945. The President of the Planning Board also declared that the first phase of expanding industrial output cooperation between China, Japan, and Manchukuo will be completed in 1941. At the same time, a plan will be implemented to import important goods from all aspects as much as possible, without relying on one or two countries. (Reuters telegram on the 16th)

### The Japanese Yen Bloc Abuses Issuance of Banknotes; Circulation Significantly Increased

Tokyo: According to a report submitted by the Ministry of Finance to the House of Representatives Budget Committee, the amount of various banknotes in circulation in the Japanese yen bloc has increased by 4% compared to a year ago. This includes banknotes from the Bank of Japan, the Bank of Taiwan, the Bank of Korea, the "North China Reserve Bank," the "Inner Mongolia Bank," the "Chinese Commercial Bank," and the "Manchukuo United Bank." At the beginning of this year, the circulation of banknotes from the above banks was 5,547,102,000 yen. Among them, the Bank of Japan's banknotes increased from 2,754,923,000 yen at the end of last year to 3,679,031,000 yen, an increase of 33%. (United Press telegram on the 16th)

### US Republican Party Planning to Convene a Conference to Nominate a Presidential Candidate

Washington: This year's general election Republican candidate will be nominated by the party's National Convention. The party's Executive Committee has scheduled a meeting for the 16th to determine the date and location of the National Convention.

### Newspaper Attacks Government: Secrecy in All Matters is a Suicidal Policy; People Being Kept in the Dark Makes Cooperation Difficult

Tokyo: The "Nichinichi Shimbun" and "Asahi Shimbun" today criticized the Japanese government's policy of secrecy in all matters. The "Nichinichi Shimbun" stated that since newspapers cannot find out what is discussed in various secret meetings, the general public certainly has no way of knowing. At the same time, ministers are also unable to provide clear and detailed answers to the questions of parliamentarians. "If the people are always kept in the dark and have no way of knowing about issues that affect them, it will be difficult to fully cooperate with the government. The government on the one hand asks the people to cooperate with it, and on the other hand adopts a policy of secrecy. This attitude is not only selfish but also suicidal." According to the "Asahi Shimbun," "The current cabinet lacks creativity and is almost no different from the Hiranuma Cabinet and the Abe Cabinet. What we don't understand is why the cabinet also holds secret meetings on matters that have nothing to do with military affairs, and does not let people know. In short, except for military affairs, we really don't know why everything must be kept secret." (United Press dispatch on the 16th)

### France Resents Japanese Aggression: Renewal of Commercial Treaty Unlikely; Tokyo Pays Attention to the Progress of Negotiations; Japanese Personnel Already Consider it a Matter of Concern

Tokyo: It is learned here that the Japanese Ambassador to France, Sawada, after arriving in Paris before the end of last year, immediately negotiated with France regarding the renewal of the Franco-Japanese Commercial Treaty. It is noted that the current Franco-Japanese commercial relationship went into effect on March 15th of last year and is due to expire on the same date this year. However, Japanese personnel concerned about this matter consider it unlikely that the commercial treaty will be renewed on the same terms, because in 1907, France and Japan established an agreement stipulating that both sides would help each other to protect the peace and security of the Chinese region adjacent to the territories of France and Japan. Since Japan has completely disregarded this agreement and invaded Hainan Island and its nearby Chinese territories, and has extensively bombed the French-funded Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, France's animosity towards Japan must have greatly increased. Therefore, Tokyo is currently paying close attention to the progress of the current negotiations. It is noted that last year Japan enjoyed considerable commercial convenience in France and Vietnam, Syria, Morocco, Tunisia, New Caledonia, and other French territories. Japan's exports to these areas exceeded £3,750,000, and imports exceeded £2,700,000. Japan's exports are mostly canned goods, poppy fish and other foods, as well as pottery and silk, while it imports large quantities of military supplies from France, salt from Tunisia, and rubber and coal from Vietnam.

### Woodward Advocates Rapid Expansion of the Navy

Newark: According to Rear Admiral Woodward, commander of the U.S. Third Naval District, speaking at the Eastern Security Conference today, the U.S. Navy urgently needs to be rapidly expanded, because its distance from the "realm of being second to none" is too great. The current U.S. Navy is not as good as Britain's, and is not much stronger than Japan's. It is noted that at the end of the last war, the U.S. Navy could be described as second to none in the world, but after the Washington Conference and the London Conference, it was reduced to a third-rate navy. Since 1933, the U.S. Navy has seen improvement, but it still ranks second, and Japan is closely following behind. Finally, Woodward stated that the cost of expanding the navy is negligible compared to the national defense security gained. Therefore, he advocated that the U.S. Navy must be expanded to the point where it is not determined by any country. (United Press dispatch on the 16th)

### Vincent Opposes Building Super Battleships; Requests House to Restore Funding for Aircraft and Military Supplies

It is said that naval experts generally believe that warships should not exceed 45,000 tons. (United Press dispatch on the 16th)

### The Philippines is Economically Insufficient for Independence; McNutt Says If the U.S. Abandons the Philippines, it Will Be Difficult to Maintain Open Door

Washington: Federal Security Administrator, formerly the U.S. High Commissioner to the Philippines, McNutt, stated in a club meeting today that the Philippines is not yet economically independent. Furthermore, if the U.S. withdraws from the Philippines, it will be impossible to maintain the open door policy in China. Finally, "the Philippines does not have the strength to resist various dangers and bear the full responsibility for independence." (United Press dispatch on the 16th)

The team members include Badger, a lecturer at the University of Bristol, and Vince, a famous football player. A shipping company has long waived the team members' fares. Dr. Duke, a medical missionary from the Methodist Church, will join in Hong Kong. The Times recently published a letter calling on the public to donate funds to send this team to Guiyang, because a message was received from Guiyang stating that the personnel of the local relief society are insufficient and requesting that new personnel be sent to assist.

### Soviet Offensive Reaches Peak; Part of Mannerheim Line Breached; Finnish Troops in Summa Area Retreat to Second Line of Defense; Red Army Cavalry Crossing Frozen Lake Repelled by Artillery Fire

Helsinki: Regarding the Soviet troops breaching the Mannerheim Line yesterday, Finnish officials have acknowledged this today. According to unconfirmed reports, the Finnish line was breached in two locations: Summa and the Taipale River. (Haitong dispatch on the 16th)

Stockholm: According to a message received here from Helsinki, the Finnish troops in the Summa area, under continuous heavy attacks by the Soviet army, withdrew from the first line of the Mannerheim Line at midnight on Wednesday. (United Press dispatch on the 16th)

Helsinki: The Soviet army is now attacking from a broader front. The two armies north of the Karelian Isthmus are now only separated by the narrow Taipale River. The Soviet troops currently attacking Summa and Taipale have greatly increased compared to before. (Reuters dispatch on the 16th)

Stockholm: Finnish personnel here have recently declared that although the Soviet Union has launched a large-scale offensive on the Mannerheim Line in recent days, and although its offensive has reached its peak, the Mannerheim Line has remained unmoved for several days. The terrain lost by the Finnish army is still limited. In addition, a Red Army cavalry unit launched an offensive on the frozen sea surface of the Gulf of Finland yesterday, attempting to attack the Finnish army's right flank, but was repelled by artillery fire from the Bjoerkoe Island fortress. This cavalry unit is entirely composed of natives from the Caucasus, whose combat strength is stronger than that of the Russians. (Havas dispatch on the 16th)

Helsinki: It is learned here that the Finnish army has been forced to withdraw from the first line of defense of the Mannerheim Line in the Summa area. The Soviet army is concentrating its attacks on four locations: Summa, Onnela, Taipale, and east of Lake Muolaa. The battle in the Summa area is fierce, and both sides have suffered heavy losses. The Finnish army on the Karelian front has retreated to the second line of defense in the west, and is still holding the first line of defense in the east, but the Soviet offensive is very fierce. The Soviet army northeast of Lake Ladoga is still fiercely attacking along the railway. There is also fighting on the Koihm front. (Haitong dispatch on the 16th)

Helsinki: Because Finland lacks fresh reserve troops, it is very concerned about the position of the Karelian Isthmus. However, some of the forward positions of the Mannerheim Line occupied by the Soviet army have been retaken by the Finnish army. (Reuters dispatch on the 16th)

Stockholm: The Soviet army's attack on the Mannerheim Line intensified yesterday, advancing along the new line. However, the Finnish troops in various places all seem to be firmly defending Summa, the ice on Lake Muolaanjärvi north of it, and the Taipale area. The Soviet army is attacking the Finnish army fiercely again. If it wins on the lake, the Finnish army will suffer a major blow, because the Soviet army can reach one of the important roads leading to Viipuri. However, in order to attack on the lake, the Soviet army must advance ten miles across the lake, and will inevitably encounter the Finnish firepower hidden in the surrounding forests, with no cover. Furthermore, the two to four feet of snow on the ice makes it even more difficult for the Soviet army to advance. (Reuters

Helsinki: The Soviet army's offensive towards the southern Summa area has now become increasingly active, and its artillery fire is extremely fierce. According to a Finnish officer, the Red Army fired more than 200 rounds of artillery at a small position guarded by a Finnish army company. It is not difficult to imagine the situation in other places. The Finnish Bjoerkoe Island fortress retaliated, not only deterring the Red Army's offensive, but also bombarding its rear positions. As a result of the fierce battle between the two sides, both sides had gains and losses. The Finnish army destroyed a total of thirteen Soviet tanks and killed a thousand Red Army officers and soldiers. In addition, two Red Army divisions launched a fierce attack in the Taipale River area, but failed and retreated with the loss of 2,500 officers and soldiers. According to observers here, although the Finnish army resisted fiercely, the government authorities only recently called up reserve soldiers born in 1896 and 1897, and will have no more soldiers to mobilize in the future. Therefore, the situation on the front line is not optimistic. (Havas dispatch on the 16th)

### Soviet-Finnish War Report

Moscow: According to a communique from the Leningrad Military District Headquarters, yesterday the Soviet troops continued to fight successfully in the Karelian Isthmus, forcing the enemy to retreat, abandoning a lot of military supplies, and suffering heavy damage. The Soviet army has now approached Kamara. As a result of yesterday's battle, the Soviet army recaptured 53 fortifications, including 21 solid artillery positions. In other areas, there were also reconnaissance team activities and infantry clashes. The Soviet Air Force bombed enemy troops and enemy military targets very successfully. Six enemy aircraft were shot down in air combat. (TASS dispatch on the 16th)

Helsinki: Last night's communique here stated that the Soviet troops continued to attack on the entire front line. Their attempt to break through the ice in the Gulf of Finland has been repelled. As a result of the Soviet army's attack in Muolaanjärvi, a thousand people were killed and thirteen tanks were destroyed. In the Taipale area, the Finnish army repeatedly resisted and remained unmoved. It is estimated that 2,500 Soviet soldiers were killed in this area. In the Summa area, the Finnish army also repelled all attacks. The Soviet army northeast of Lake Ladoga attacked several times but did not succeed. The Soviet army also destroyed a hundred teams of Finnish food transportation convoys. The Finnish coastal artillery team on the Karelian Isthmus has repelled the Soviet attempt to cross the ice. Finnish aircraft attacked Soviet troop concentrations and food storage areas. Yesterday, sixteen Soviet military aircraft were shot down in Finnish territory, and another bomber was forced to land in Finnish territory. (Reuters dispatch on the 16th)

Lake Ladoga North: According to Finnish officers today, in the Karuntai area on the northeastern wall of Lake Ladoga in central Finland, there are 10,000 Finnish soldiers killed and about 40,000 wounded. It is noted that the Soviet army in this area has three divisions, which caused great tension for the Finnish side in the middle of last month. However, the situation has now turned from danger to safety, and the Red Army's position has become more precarious. Every night, the Finnish army is sure to use supernatural methods to carry out extremely fierce night attacks on the Soviet army, while continuously firing at them with heavy artillery. The Red Army in that area is now gradually withdrawing. In short, in terms of all front lines, it can be said that all parties have reported victories. (United Press dispatch on the 16th)

### Soviet Air Force Launches Frenzied Bombing

Helsinki: The Soviet Air Force was very active yesterday, flying to various cities and coastal areas in southern Finland, as well as the Kymijoki River basin, to carry out bombing.

### Sweden Refuses to Provide Finland with Direct Military Assistance; Britain and France Continuously Provide Military Supplies; Finnish Army's Resistance Strength Increases

Stockholm: The Swedish Prime Minister announced today that he has refused Finland's request for direct military assistance, and said that Finland has repeatedly requested Sweden to provide various necessities, which have been assisted as much as possible. In addition, the treatment of Finnish wounded and sick in Sweden has also been taken care of. Finnish government personnel have repeatedly raised the issue of manpower supply when they come here. Most recently, the Finnish Foreign Minister raised this issue on February 13. However, the Swedish government's policy remains unchanged. According to reports here, the Finnish government has notified Sweden that it may be difficult to support itself for long, and unless Sweden assists with two divisions of volunteer soldiers, it will have to seek assistance from Western European countries. (Reuters dispatch on the 16th)

The Hague: According to Finnish sources, the country's army has recently received military supplies from Britain and France, mostly war defense cannons and fighters. Therefore, its resistance to the Red Army armored divisions has been greatly enhanced. In addition, foreign volunteer soldiers fighting in Finland, except for the Swedish ones led by Swedish officers, are all reportedly under the command of French General Gamelin. (Havas dispatch on the 16th)

### Bulgaria's New Cabinet Formed; Filov Appointed Prime Minister; Policies Remain Unchanged

Sofia: After the resignation of the Koseivanov cabinet, Education Minister Filov was ordered to form a cabinet, which has now been completed.

It is noted that the new Foreign Minister Popov was once the Bulgarian Minister to Yugoslavia. Popov was born in 1890 in Svishtov on the Danube River. He studied linguistics and law at the universities of Berlin and Sofia. From 1920 to 1933, he served as the director of the information department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He then served as the chargé d'affaires to Hungary and the ministers to various countries in Romania and Czechoslovakia. He is experienced and worthy of celebration. (Haitong News Agency)

Sofia: The new Bulgarian Prime Minister Filov told reporters this morning that there will be no changes in domestic or foreign policy. The recent successful organization of the joint Bulgarian-Romanian Chamber of Commerce proves Bulgaria's willingness to cooperate economically with neighboring countries. The Bulgarian News Agency reported that the Bulgarian parliament will convene a meeting in the near future. (Haitong dispatch on the 16th)

Paris: The change of cabinet in Bulgaria has recently been commented on by diplomatic circles here. It is generally said that this has nothing to do with the country's foreign policy. It is expected that the Filov cabinet will promote relations with various countries in the Balkan Peninsula. The new Foreign Minister Popov has served as the Minister to Yugoslavia and has contributed greatly to the rapprochement between Bulgaria and Romania. His promotion to Foreign Minister makes France feel a good impression. (Havas dispatch on the 16th)

### Anglo-Italian Trade Negotiations Encounter Difficulties; Italian Policy Goes Astray; This Provides Clear Evidence

London: The trade negotiations recently conducted between Britain and Italy have encountered difficulties. According to political figures here, Italy needs various raw materials for the negotiations to be successful. Therefore, the British government does not attach much importance to these difficulties. However, Italy's policy has "gone astray" at this time, and it is difficult to predict when it will change course. In any case, the British government will not do anything to please Italy and thus resolve the difficulties in the negotiation agenda. Since the difficulties were caused by Italy, it should be initiated by that country to remedy them. (Havas dispatch on the 15th)

### Rumors that German and Soviet General Staffs Have Agreed on Military Cooperation Methods to Prevent British and French Interference in Eastern European War; Germany Can Handle the Western Front Alone

Bern: The "Ticino Post" recently published a dispatch from its Berlin correspondent stating that the German and Soviet General Staffs have actually agreed on military cooperation methods. German political figures generally say that even if the current European war expands its scope and other countries join it in the future, Germany is prepared for any eventuality. According to the cooperation plan agreed upon by Germany and the Soviet Union, if Britain, France, or any neutral country endangers the Soviet Union's position, Germany will immediately join the Finnish-Soviet war. If the Soviet Union is threatened in southern Europe or the Danube region, Germany will also intervene. It is reported that Chancellor Hitler also intends to make a speech in the near future to explain the relationship between Germany and the Soviet Union. (Havas dispatch on the 15th)

Stockholm: A newspaper's Berlin dispatch states that German officials firmly deny overseas rumors that the Soviet Union and Germany have signed a military alliance. German Foreign Ministry personnel believe that this news is due to the satisfactory conclusion of a commercial agreement between Germany and the Soviet Union, and claim that Germany does not need Soviet assistance and is sufficient to defeat Britain and France alone. The dispatch continued, saying that Germany does not want military assistance, but hopes that neutral neighboring countries will supply raw materials so that Germany can break the Allied blockade. Berlin officials are of course closely monitoring the results of Britain and France's appeal to neutral countries to participate in the war, while also claiming that Germany does not want to see Italy and the Soviet Union join the war against the Allied countries.

### Moscow Newspaper Commentary: The Soviet-German Economic Agreement Possesses Significant Political Character; Stipulates Germany's Assistance to the USSR with Military Supplies

Moscow - "Izvestia" commented today, stating, "The economic agreement established between the Soviet Union and Germany on February 11th is extremely important, both economically and politically. This agreement is based on the common interests of both countries. In fact, political and economic cooperation between the two countries began long ago as a result of the trade and credit treaty concluded in August 1939. The economic agreement that has now been established proves that political and economic cooperation between the two countries will inevitably become even closer. The establishment of the Soviet-German trade and credit treaty occurred at a time of serious political relations, and its purpose was to eliminate this serious atmosphere and further improve political and economic relations between the two countries. In fact, after the treaty was established, the Soviet Union and Germany signed a non-aggression pact on August 23, 1939, and a treaty of friendship and borders was established in September of the same year. With the signing of these various agreements, Soviet-German economic and political relations entered a new phase. Undoubtedly, after the implementation of the Soviet-German Non-Aggression Treaty, the total trade volume stipulated in the trade and credit treaty was deemed insufficient. Therefore, during political negotiations held in September 1939, both parties unanimously expressed their efforts to further deepen economic relations. The results of both parties' efforts have been confirmed by the documents exchanged on September 28, 1939, by Molotov, Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars of the Soviet Union and People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, and the German Foreign Minister. September 28th was the date of the signing of the Soviet-German Treaty of Friendship and Borders.

"Furthermore, this document stipulates that both parties will strive to develop economic relations. Therefore, both parties decided to draft an economic plan to ensure that the total trade volume between Germany and the Soviet Union reaches an unprecedented record high. Regarding this point, the German economic delegation conducted negotiations with the Soviet People's Commissariat for Foreign Trade. After several months of negotiations, the Soviet Union and Germany finally established an economic agreement on February 11th of this year. The Soviet Union is the country with the richest raw materials in the world, and raw materials are extremely needed by the German side. On the other hand, Germany is the world's leading manufacturer of high-quality machinery. Although the Soviet Union's machinery industry is very developed, it has continued to import a large number of German machines in recent years. According to the German-Soviet agreement, the Soviet Union will supply raw materials to Germany, while Germany will export industrial products (including military supplies) to the Soviet Union. Furthermore, in the first year of the agreement's implementation, the total trade volume between the two countries will exceed any figure for trade between the two countries since the World War. Both parties will strive to continue to increase the supply as much as possible. The agreement stipulates that the Soviet Union will supply a large amount of raw materials to Germany, which is very important, as Germany is currently in need of a large supply of raw materials due to the blockade by the Allied countries.

"The German-Soviet economic agreement will also enable the Soviet Union to expand its foreign trade. The Soviet Union's foreign trade has been greatly affected by the obstruction of the United Kingdom and France, but this difficulty has been eliminated due to the signing of the German-Soviet economic agreement. Even before the outbreak of the war, the Soviet Union had ordered goods from British and French factories, but the United Kingdom and France cancelled the orders, thereby severing trade relations with the Soviet Union and suffering losses themselves. Since the Soviet Union cannot obtain goods from the United Kingdom and France, it does not need to transport goods to the United Kingdom and France. The French government recently imitated London's bad actions of 1927, searching the Soviet trade representative in Paris with actions akin to bandits. Under such circumstances, how can we conduct normal trade relations with the French side? Currently, the Soviet Union's industry and agriculture are both extremely developed and no longer need to rely on foreign countries. At the same time, due to the development of economic strength, the Soviet Union can also do without the help of the United Kingdom and France. The Soviet Union has increased trade with Germany. In short, Germany and the Soviet Union are both willing to work hard to establish a permanent economic cooperation between the two countries. The trade agreement of August 19, 1939, has been successfully implemented by both Germany and the Soviet Union, and as a result, the economic relations between the two countries have greatly improved. The economic agreement signed on February 11th of this year will definitely bring the trade between the two countries to the highest point, exceeding any previous figure, and will be extremely beneficial to both parties. The political relations between the Soviet Union and Germany have greatly improved at the end of last year. The economic agreement currently signed proves that this friendly relationship has become even closer and has laid a very solid foundation for future development." (TASS dispatch, 16th)

### General Göring's Speech: Encourages Farmers to Strive for Production to Meet Wartime Needs; Germany is Confident of Being Invincible in Military and Economic Terms; One Million Poles Forced to Assist in Farming

Berlin - General Göring, Minister of Aviation, delivered his first broadcast speech to German farmers yesterday since the start of the war last September, explaining the basic principles of the "1940 Production War." He declared, "In economic terms, we cannot be overcome. In military terms, we are even more difficult to defeat. Morale is especially unconquerable." Göring stated that Germany has already stockpiled seven million tons of grain, and the government has taken measures to help German farmers increase agricultural production as much as possible. The United Kingdom and France are now repeating their old tricks, trying to destroy the German nation with an economic blockade, but the German economic system cannot repeat the mistakes of 1918 because it was already organized in peacetime. Germany's transportation to the east, south, and north is now secure, and the economic foundations of agriculture, industry, and commerce are stable. Fortunately, we have not wasted a minute in the past few years. Although there is a shortage of raw materials, thanks to hard work and the inventions of German inventors, there are already a large number of substitutes, which are even better than foreign raw materials. Therefore, we cannot be overcome in economic terms, and we are even more difficult to defeat in military terms. Morale and public opinion are especially unconquerable. The United Kingdom should recognize this.

Göring went on to say that the British Empire has three founding principles: (1) economic exploitation, (2) the use of violence, and (3) the commission of many injustices. Its consistent weapon is "fabricating rumors and propaganda." These principles and methods are no longer applicable to Germany today. The wealthy United Kingdom is now copying the German rationing system for food, and the amount of rations is even smaller than in Germany, which is ridiculous. It must be known that it is difficult for the United Kingdom to copy National Socialist methods in a short period of time, because its consistent financial system cannot be overthrown in a hurry. We believe that the United Kingdom must have reserves, but these reserves are far overseas, and because of the activity of our submarines, they have sunk to the bottom of the sea off the coast of the United Kingdom. However, our stockpiles of grain, potatoes, sugar, and oilseeds are all within Germany and are not subject to external destruction. Göring then asked German farm women to work hard in the fields, as farmers on the front lines cannot be transferred back to their hometowns, but the government will mobilize youth and one million Poles and prisoners of war to assist in this spring's agricultural work. At the same time, farmers in the military with special skills and specialized agricultural experience will also be exempt from military service and return to rural areas to work. As for the participation of foreign farmers, it is not, as Paris and London claim, the result of violence and threats, but rather they are happy and willing to seek paid work in Germany. Göring went on to say that all the horses, machinery, farm implements, fuel, and fertilizers needed for this spring's agricultural work have been fully prepared, and the transportation problem has also been addressed.

Göring then put forward the phrase "1940 Production War" as a slogan for German farmers, emphasizing that every acre of land should be fully utilized. The British blockade of Germany is called a "fat blockade" because its specific purpose is to cut off Germany's fat supply. Therefore, Germany must strive for fat production in order to smash the British plan. The specific measures to increase fat production are as follows:

(1) Increase the area of land planted with oilseeds by 500,000 acres, with special bonuses for those with particularly abundant yields. (2) Increase the amount of sugar beets and potatoes by at least 10% to 15% on each farm. (3) Convert grassland to farmland, with the government providing a subsidy of 240 marks per two and a half acres. (4) Increase the production of milk and butter, with the government encouraging it with bonuses. At the same time, farmers are advised to use less milk in order to make butter to replace imported products.

Finally, Göring asked German farmers to maintain confidence and continue to fight, and after shouting the slogans "Victory belongs to us" and "Heil Hitler," the meeting was adjourned. (Haitong dispatch, 16th)

Paris - General Göring, Germany's four-year economic dictator, recently gave a speech to farmers throughout the country, which has been commented on by political figures here. It is noteworthy that Göring did not mention a word about the agricultural products that Central European countries, especially the Soviet Union, could supply to Germany. Because after the German-Soviet economic agreement was signed in Moscow on the 12th of this month, German newspapers have praised the government for obtaining an infinite supply of raw materials for the people. Unexpectedly, Göring's speech this time only promoted economic self-sufficiency and encouraged the people to work hard and improve production methods in order to increase production. It can be clearly seen from this that Germany does not believe that it can rely on the Soviet Union and other countries economically in the long run. (Havas dispatch, 15th)

London - General Göring, Germany's four-year economic plan dictator, delivered a speech to farmers throughout the country yesterday, which has been commented on by various newspapers here. In addition to the usual criticism of the United Kingdom, there are two main points in the speech: one is that he asked farmers throughout the country to bury themselves in production in a very serious tone, and the other is that he confirmed that the German authorities have transferred one million people from Poland to Germany to engage in cultivation. The Labor Party's newspaper, "Daily Herald," stated that the Polish people have been subjected to abuse by the German authorities, which is the most cruel means of oppression in modern times. The Liberal Party's "News Chronicle" stated that there are already 200,000 Polish civilians in Germany who have been reduced to slavery, in addition to prisoners of war, and that these people are definitely not willing to go to Germany. (Havas dispatch, 16th)

Stockholm, Switzerland - General Göring's speech yesterday afternoon has been released by the semi-official German News Agency in the country, but important sections on the lack of artificial coal have been deleted. German morning newspapers claimed that the speech arrived at the editorial department too late and have not yet published it. The reason for this is still unknown. (Havas dispatch, 16th)

### British Secretary of War Inspects the Western Front; Lord Milne Accompanies Him

From 1926 to 1933, he served as Chief of the General Staff of the British Army. Lord Milne advocated taking the offensive in this decisive battle. Hart had written an article in the "Daily Express" weekly criticizing it. (Haitong dispatch, 16th)

### The Maginot Line is as Solid as a Rock; German Blitzkrieg Tactics Will Have No Place to Use

London - Lieutenant General Swinton said in a broadcast speech today that Germany has manufactured a large number of heavy tanks, which are large in size, heavily armored, and equipped with flamethrowers and small cannons. They are used to form an vanguard in the hope of achieving a quick victory. When the German army advanced to Austria, the Czech Republic, and Poland, it used these tanks as a guide. However, it should be noted that this vanguard has never encountered obstacles equivalent to the Maginot Line. (Havas dispatch, 15th)

### German Submarines Rampant in Various European Waters; Attempting to Cut Off Overseas Trade of Neutral Countries; Dutch Ships Sunk, Netherlands Protests to Germany

London - A correspondent for the "Daily Telegraph" in Danzig reported that the German submarine fleet is about to launch a general offensive against merchant ships of various neutral countries. The country's naval department has received an order from Führer Hitler to conduct unrestricted submarine warfare in all parts of the world, on a scale even greater than that dreamed of by Grand Admiral Tirpitz, former commander of the German Navy, during the last European War. Recently, Dutch, Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish ships have been sunk by German submarines. Although the country's naval spokesman said that "this action is in full compliance with international naval warfare regulations," in reality, this is just the prelude to Germany's attempt to cut off the overseas trade of various neutral countries. (Havas dispatch, 16th)

The Hague - It is heard that the Dutch government has lodged a stern verbal protest with the German government regarding the sinking of the Dutch ship "Borgedyk" by torpedo before submitting a written protest. It is heard that the Netherlands will demand full compensation from Germany. Responsible parties claim that although it is possible that the German submarine commander may have acted against orders, the German government cannot escape responsibility for absolutely unreasonable actions.

### Several More Shipwrecks

Genoa, Italy - The Italian ship "Gioacchino Orseolo" (5,649 tons), which was sailing to Keyser, New York, in the United States to load a large amount of coal to return home for use by the Italian railways, sank yesterday in the eastern waters of the United Kingdom after hitting a mine. This is the third Italian ship to sink after hitting a mine. (Havas dispatch, 15th)

London - The wreckage of the Italian freighter "Orseolo" (5,694 tons), which sank after hitting a mine yesterday, was discovered today near the east coast of England. Seventeen of the thirty-two crew members have been rescued. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)

London - The Danish ship Dragon (04 tons) and the Sleipner (006 tons) were torpedoed and sunk in the early hours of this morning off the coast of the East Sea of England. Six people were rescued from the first ship and six passengers and sailors were rescued from the second ship. A Norwegian shipwreck was found floating off the coast of Scotland due to ocean currents. Its name is vague and unclear. It is found that two ships that recently left England for Norway have not arrived on time. One is the "Bissau" (1,000 tons). According to news from Norway today, it has not arrived at its destination as scheduled, and it is feared that it has encountered danger. The other ship, "Bygdøy," left a certain port in the country nine days after it set sail. So far, there has been no trace of it. All sectors in Norway believe that the shipwreck seen off the coast of Scotland may be one of these two ships. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)

### British Warship Sinks Two German Submarines

Oslo - Newspapers reported that a German submarine attempted to launch a torpedo to sink a Norwegian ship, but before the torpedo was launched, the submarine exploded and sank, apparently sunk by a British destroyer. At that time, the crew of the Norwegian ship and the thirty-three distressed crew members rescued from the Norwegian motor ship "Snarøsund" had already abandoned ship and escaped by boat, but seeing the submarine sink, they returned to the ship and safely sailed to Bergen. The "Snarøsund" (4,114 tons) was torpedoed and sunk on its way to the Americas on Sunday. The crew escaped by boat because they received a warning in advance. The next day, they were rescued by another Norwegian ship. (Reuters dispatch, 10th)

After the British freighter "Sultan Star" was sunk by a German submarine in the Atlantic Ocean the day before yesterday, its owner and crew arrived here today. According to the owner, the ship was carrying 8,000 tons of refrigerated meat and a batch of butter. After sinking the ship, the German submarine was sunk by a British warship. It is suspected that the submarine's original intention was to wait for the British battleship "Repulse" or the cruiser "Exeter" to pass by and attack them.

### American Countries to Exchange Diplomatic Opinions on German Note; Washington Political Circles Advocate Detaining British, French, and German Ships; Forcing Those Countries to Recognize the American Security Zone

Washington - US Secretary of State Hull refused to criticize the German government's note to the Panamanian government at a press conference at the White House today. The German note protested that we recognize the naval warfare outside the port of Montevideo, which is a violation of American neutrality. Hull stated that the US government must receive a formal German note before it can comment. Hull believes that the German note will definitely become a topic for American countries to exchange diplomatic opinions. (Haitong dispatch, 16th)

Washington - When Secretary of State Hull met with reporters, a reporter asked about the news reported by Berlin yesterday that if American ships sailed to British and French ports, German submarines would use torpedoes to sink them. The Secretary of State immediately replied that, as of now, the State Department has only received a report from the US Embassy in Germany stating that a reporter from a Berlin radio station made this statement, but the truth of the matter is still unclear and needs to be investigated further. (Havas dispatch, 15th)

Washington - After the German government officially published its response to the Panama Declaration, people close to the State Department commented that Germany's attitude was not surprising, because it did not recognize the British, French, and German security zone at all. Political figures in Washington are therefore discussing how to make the security zone recognized, and advocate detaining all the ships of the United Kingdom, France, and Germany currently in the ports of American countries in order to force those countries to recognize the security zone. Official sources said that the American countries are currently exchanging opinions on this matter. (Haitong dispatch, 16th)

Washington - Senator Pittman, chairman of the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said yesterday that if the United Kingdom does not implement a blockade policy, the risk of American ships being torpedoed will be reduced. Other senators agreed with this view. (Haitong dispatch, 16th)

### Japanese Reinforcements in Northern Guangdong, Major Battle Brewing Again in Xin Jie, Japanese Front Lines at Conghua and Hua County, Chinese Troops Have Advanced and Surrounded Longxiang and Other Places

Hong Kong Correspondence: The war in northern Guangdong, since the Chinese army's counter-offensive forced the Japanese army back to Xin Jie, continues to advance. The Japanese troops in Conghua and Hua County have also retreated to Shengang, Lianglong, and other places. However, according to frontline news on the 4th, the Japanese army reinforced Xin Jie on the 2nd and 3rd, seemingly with the intention of attacking again. A major battle is brewing once more on the front lines of the Guangdong Railway. The Chinese army is closely monitoring and ready to block any attack.

Fierce Fighting Occurs in the Lianglong Area

The Chinese army on the Guanghua Road in northern Guangdong has launched frequent attacks in the past ten days, successively defeating the Japanese and puppet troops in Longkou, Xiangshan, and other places, and encircling Longxiang (northeast of Xin Jie). The Japanese army urgently requested reinforcements from Guangzhou and resisted with fortifications. On the 3rd and 4th, several hundred troops were reinforced from Yu Bei. On the morning of the 5th, a mixed Japanese force of infantry, cavalry, and artillery, numbering over 400, carrying light and heavy artillery pieces, advanced from Longxiang along Longkou towards Pingshan and Lianglong (south of Hua County), attempting to break through the front lines of the Chinese army on the Guanghua Line. A certain unit of the Chinese army stationed in Hua County rose up to meet them, engaging in extremely fierce fighting with the Japanese army between Longkou and Pingshan. The Japanese army launched several attacks, but were all repulsed, leaving behind many corpses. By 3:00 PM, they were completely defeated and fled back to Xin Jie and Longxiang. In this battle, the Chinese army annihilated over 100 Japanese soldiers, seized over 20 rifles, and a large amount of other military supplies. The Chinese army is currently searching and advancing, and the remaining 200 Japanese soldiers near Longkou are heavily besieged.

Japanese Transport Vehicle Ambushed and Blown Up

The Chinese army units active in the suburbs of Guangzhou City have used clever tactics to achieve repeated successes in recent weeks. In the early hours of the 3rd, the Ye unit gathered several hundred men and laid an ambush at Xiaoping in the city suburbs, burying landmines. Around 6:00 AM, a column of Japanese transport vehicles heading north from Huangsha Station reached the location and triggered the landmines, causing the lead vehicle and the front cars to be destroyed, making it impossible to continue. The Chinese army seized the opportunity to launch a surprise attack, causing panic among the Japanese troops who fled in disarray. Subsequently, Japanese troops from the Shijingxi Village came to their aid, but the Chinese army, having accomplished their mission, retreated safely. Later investigations revealed that over a hundred Japanese and puppet soldiers were killed or wounded, countless military supplies were destroyed, and a large number of weapons and ammunition were seized. The Japanese army suffered extremely heavy losses. After this incident, the Japanese army urgently sought to "clean up" the Chinese plainclothes teams along the Guangdong-Hankou Railway, indiscriminately arresting over a hundred civilians in the villages along the line and brutally beating them.

Chinese Army Bravely Assaults Jinhe at Night in Cold Weather

The Japanese army in Conghua has recently increased its troop strength in the Taipingchang area to 1,000 Japanese and puppet soldiers, and is again attempting to make trouble, frequently shelling various locations along the Guangcong Line. The Chinese army has also stepped up its attacks. At midnight on the 4th, amidst the severe cold, they launched a night attack on Jinhe Market. The Japanese army was caught off guard, and the Chinese army charged into the northeastern positions, setting several Japanese camps on fire. The flames quickly spread, aided by the wind, engulfing the area. The Japanese and puppet soldiers were in even greater disarray. The Japanese troops stationed in Taipingchang, upon hearing the news, rushed to their aid, but were intercepted by another unit of the Chinese army, suffering heavy casualties and fleeing in confusion. At 3:00 AM on the 5th, the Chinese army assault units began to retreat on their own initiative.

### Commercial Situation in Hangzhou, Jiaxing and Huzhou: Japanese Army Forcibly Collects Rice

Jiaxing Correspondence: The puppet county governments of Hangzhou, Yuhang, Haining, Fuyang, and other counties have secretly moved their puppet offices into Japanese military intelligence stations, hoping to gain the protection of the Japanese, due to the extraordinary activity of the mobile units of the Chinese army in the surrounding areas. However, although the puppet organizations have been secretly moved, the Japanese not only do not provide protection, but also use them to cover up Japanese organizations. For example, last winter, when the Chinese army attacked the city of Fuyang, they searched everywhere. When they searched the Japanese intelligence station, the Japanese did not allow the puppet officials to escape, and they escaped through the back door, causing the puppet officials to be arrested and executed. As for the commercial situation in the above-mentioned areas, most of the businesses are small shops. All goods are sold by the Japanese. In addition to paying heavy taxes, English, American, and Chinese goods are sometimes confiscated for various reasons, causing ordinary merchants not to dare to sell them. The rice situation is also very worrying. The Japanese ordered the puppet governments to deliver a certain amount of rice every month, such as 10,000 dan of white rice per month for Hangzhou, 3,000 dan for Yuhang, 3,000 dan for Fuyang, and 5,000 dan for Haining, causing rice prices in various places to rise sharply, averaging over 30 yuan per shi. Puppet officials, large and small, in the puppet governments of Haiyan, Jiaxing, Pinghu, Tongxiang, Chongde, Jiashan, Deqing, Wuxing, and other counties in the Jiahu area are also wary due to the activity of the guerrillas, and are taking leave of absence for various reasons, but the Japanese army does not approve of it, and they can do nothing about it. As for the commercial situation, the Lake area has not made a profit in the past year, because the exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous fees are a heavy burden, the purchasing power of the residents is very weak, and Japanese soldiers often come to forcibly take items. Therefore, many shops have closed this spring. However, the rice industry has made a good profit, with an average profit of 50% for each rice shop. In the Jia area, the most prosperous and profitable business is the opium business, so the number of drug stores is increasing every day this spring.

### Situation of the Kunshan Puppet County Government Collecting Land Tax: Oppressing Farmers and Deceiving Landlords

Kunshan Correspondence: The puppet county government still collects land tax according to the method of combined collection of rent and tax, which started on November 1st last year. Because it was a year of medium harvest, rice prices were also high, and the puppet police and tax collectors were stepping up their efforts to collect taxes, the farmers dared not resist and paid the taxes. It is said that more than one million yuan has been collected. As for the method, each district has a puppet collection office, and puppet directors are appointed to be in charge of the matter. Those who have land should report the names of the tenant farmers, the location and number of the land, and the amount of rent to be paid to the puppet collection office in the district, so that they can be transferred to the tenant farmers for collection. If anyone conceals and does not report, once it is found out, the land will be confiscated. As for the amount collected from each household, 42% is used as tax and 58% is retained and turned over to the puppet government as rent, which is prepared to be distributed to the landlords. However, in reality, there are often tenant farmers who have already paid the rent, but the puppet collection office claims that they have not paid it, and does not issue it to the landlords. There are countless cases of embezzlement. These people actually regard the embezzled land rent of the landlords as a bonus, which is distributed to the puppet officials at the end of the year, according to the size of their positions. It is said that at the end of the previous year (27th year), the directors of each puppet collection office received bonuses of 4,000 to 5,000 yuan, and at least 1,000 to 2,000 yuan, which shows the magnitude of their encroachment. However, there are as many puppet officials in each puppet collection office as hairs, from the puppet director down to the puppet accountants, collectors, clerks, and even the tax collectors, no less than 50 or 60 people, all of whom are recruited from local scum, so they can do their utmost to "scrape the ground". It is said that their monthly salary ranges from a maximum of 60 yuan to a minimum of 16 yuan. The monthly expenditure of each puppet collection office exceeds one thousand yuan for salaries alone, not including other puppet office expenses. The subsidy for the puppet police is also a considerable amount. The expenses are huge, and all of them are squeezing the blood of the farmers to supply them.

### Suzhou's Rice Shortage: Rice Shops Close One After Another, People in the City Will Run Out of Food

Suzhou Correspondence: Suzhou City's rice supply suddenly became scarce during the Lunar New Year, causing panic among the people in the city. There are more than 40 rice shops of all sizes outside the Loufeng, Xumen, and other city gates. Last year, the rice in stock reached 60,000 to 70,000 shi. Now, the Sanfeng Oil and Rice Shop outside the Gengfeng Gate has closed down. Following them, the Shenji, Zhenlong, Hongxiefeng, and other three shops outside the Lou Gate have also closed down one after another. The Zhaoyuan, Zhenwan, and Yuanchang outside the Geng Gate are also difficult to support. The reason for this is the lack of rice sources. Those who have rice in stock are waiting to see what happens. The Xintai Qia and Qianfenghang in the city, although they have 700 to 800 shi in stock, have now stopped trading. Smaller rice shops are even more difficult to survive. On the second day of the red plate opening, there were very few samples at the Sanwanchang Tea Party. The rice industry said that if there is no way to replenish the rice supply in the future, the people of Suzhou will run out of food.

### Overview of the Implementation of Cooperation Between Construction and Education for Specialized Technology in the Past Year (2)

There are Five Methods for Introducing Occupations

Job Introduction

The introduction of jobs is not mandatory, and is based purely on the registrant's expertise, aspirations, and expected compensation. There are five methods of introduction: (1) Copy and send the entire resume to various agencies for selection; (2) Introduce the registrant to take training; (3) Designate personnel for various agencies to distribute service groups; (4) Cooperative introduction; (5) Ordinary introduction. The resumes of all qualified registered personnel in each month have been copied and sent to the relevant central authorities for selection. The Ministries of Communications, Economics, Interior, and Military Administration have successively issued orders to their subordinate agencies to select as much as possible, or to consult with the capital city in person to broaden the path of employment. The effectiveness of the cooperation between the construction and education authorities is fully demonstrated here. In addition, if agencies and organizations need technical personnel, or if they hold special training courses to train personnel, the consulting office will select appropriate personnel to introduce after receiving notification or after finding out. For those who have retreated from the war zone and need temporary relief, the consulting office will also request the relevant authorities to register and allocate work, such as asking the Ministry of Education to distribute teachers to serve in social education work groups, and asking the Industrial and Mining Adjustment Office, the Agricultural Bank, and the China Industrial Cooperative Association to register and transfer to job introduction. If the consulting office needs specialized technical personnel and there are no suitable candidates to introduce, it can publicly solicit applications in newspapers, or contact other talent registration agencies or job introduction agencies for cooperative introduction. In addition to the above-mentioned methods, most of the job introductions are entrusted by various parties. The consulting office will give priority to selecting the best candidates from the registered personnel for introduction. It has successively entrusted 9,995 cases of introduction, 258 cases of automatic introduction by the office, and 19 cases of registrants designating work and requesting introduction, for a total of 1,272 cases of introduction. In total, there were 223 job introduction opportunities in the past year, and 744 registered personnel were introduced, among which some were introduced more than once. More than 300 others were unable to be introduced temporarily due to their place of residence. The job introduction is based on the principle of being responsible for both the employer and the job seeker. Therefore, the office requires registered job seekers to go to the office for interviews so that they can be in contact with them, so as to observe their thoughts, character, physical strength, words, and behavior for reference. For the employing agencies, they must clearly understand the conditions, work nature, and compensation of the talents they need as a basis for contact. However, since registered personnel are scattered in various places and cannot be interviewed one by one, it is difficult to have a deep understanding of each registered person. Although a method of entrusting construction and education agencies in various places to conduct interviews on behalf of the office has been established to remedy this, there are still many obstacles in implementation. In addition, registered personnel are mobile and uncertain, or they do not reply after registration, which often leads to repeated contacts, delays time, and rarely achieves success. This is the biggest difficulty in handling job introductions at present. On the part of the hiring agencies, failure to provide detailed information on all the conditions also makes it difficult for contact to proceed. Registered personnel are very strict in their choice of work location. Those in Sichuan do not want to leave Sichuan, and those in other provinces do not want to travel too far. This has its own individual difficulties in fact, but the office's job introduction has been greatly restricted. However, there are many registered personnel in Shanghai and other front-line areas who are eager to transfer to work in the interior. How to find ways to attract them in the future is an urgent problem to be solved. The issue of salary is often a prerequisite for registrants to apply for jobs. The remuneration stipulated in the entrusted cases accepted by the office is often not as desired by the registrants, so that each introduction cannot be guaranteed to be successful. However, technical personnel in science, engineering, agriculture, and technology have been sent to the relevant government authorities for record, and are waiting to be assigned work. Currently, 64 people have been registered, 158 people have been employed through direct introduction by the office, and 218 people have been employed through indirect introduction. In summary, a total of 440 people among the registered personnel have been employed in the past year, accounting for about 40%. This is the general situation of the introduction. The cooperation between construction and education is to adjust talents to meet the needs of the industry, which is only one aspect. In recent years, the calls for unemployment and the lament for the difficulty of finding talents have echoed each other without responding. Now, with the promotion of the Construction and Education Association, which acts as an intermediary, the connection is closely related to the work of resisting Japan. The Ministry of Education has always taken the lead in solving the employment of this year's university graduates. This year, there are more than 5,300 graduates from universities and colleges across the country. More than half of them have obtained service opportunities through the Ministry of Education's overall planning. In addition, all graduates of vocational schools at all levels this year have been properly placed. Graduates of all levels of schools in the past have been registered and introduced by the association. In addition, the relief of unemployed workers in transportation, industry, mining, agriculture, forestry, and other technologies has been transferred to the construction of the rear by the competent authorities. The number is more than 50,000. This is the general situation of the government's use of unemployed technical personnel since the Anti-Japanese War (End).

### Sichuan Education Department Convenes Provincial Inspection Conference

(Chengdu, 15th) The Sichuan Education Department believes that a large number of educational personnel are urgently needed to implement the new county system and promote national education. The method of combining politics and education and the method of educational inspection should also be seriously discussed. It is decided to convene a provincial inspection conference in mid-September to discuss everything.

### New Developments in Jingjiang Primary and Secondary Schools

### Saigon Interport Football Team: Three Defeats in Three Games in Hong Kong, Third Game Lost to Eastern Association

(Hong Kong Correspondence) The Saigon Interport Football Team lost to the Hong Kong Interport Team in Hong Kong, and then lost to South China. Yesterday (12th) against Eastern, they lost badly with a score of one to five. Hou Chengtong of the Eastern Association broke the first barrier, and Zhang Jinhai scored four goals, which was considered a revenge for the shame of losing one to nine in Vietnam. However, after losing the first goal, the Saigon team's actions gradually became rough, making people wonder whether South China and Eastern's defeat in Vietnam was due to technical defeat or the victory of violence. The battle process is as follows:

First Goal

On this day, the Vietnamese team used all their new strength, and the lineup changed greatly from before. Eastern was determined to win. They took the attack first. At 28 minutes, Zhong Yongsen carried the ball through two Vietnamese passes and shot low. Hou Chengtong was quick and decisive, and took the lead with a fierce attack. Eastern opened the scoring with a score of 1-0.

Second Goal

At 31 minutes, Zhang Jinhai got the ball in the middle and launched a cold arrow from more than 20 yards away. At this time, the Saigon team was in a state of confusion, and Awei had no way to respond. The ball went straight into the upper left corner, 2-0.

Third Goal

Five minutes after the change of sides, Hou Chengtong made a wonderful pass. Zhang Jinhai rushed in like a surprise attack and scored with a frontal blow, 3-0. At 10 minutes, Jinhai collided with Pani Xian, the captain of the Saigon team. Pa immediately used his fist to attack Jinhai. The referee persuaded them to stop.

Fourth Goal

After 20 minutes, Eastern adopted a defensive posture. Wu Qixiang's interception of Guiren was ineffective, and he was penetrated. Ruan Wenhong shot directly into the net, Saigon recovered a city, 1-3.

Fifth Goal

At 20 minutes, Gorya attacked Hou Chengtong and tried to intercept him horizontally. Hou fired a bullet from the border. The ball hit the goal post and bounced out. Zhang Jinhai, an ambush soldier, rose up suddenly, 4-1.

Sixth Goal

At 33 minutes, Hou Chengtong made a comeback. He made a wonderful pass in front of the goal, and Zhang Jinhai's head blossomed again, 5-1. After that, although Saigon made progress, they could not reverse the defeat. Eastern finally won with a score of 5-1.

Battle with Chinese League

The Saigon team was originally scheduled to return to Vietnam on the 13th. In response to Macau's request, they extended their trip by one week. They have now gone to Macau on the 14th. It is planned that when they pass through Hong Kong, they will have another duel with the Hong Kong Chinese League team. The date has been set (18th), and the location is Jiaoluyun Mountain.

The issue of police affairs on the extra-settlement roads in western Shanghai, after half a year of back-and-forth negotiations between Frank Craven, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession, and Fessenden, Secretary-General, with the "Municipal Government," was formally signed by both parties yesterday (16th) at 6:00 PM. The Concession authorities, recognizing the past undesirable conditions in the extra-settlement areas and the actual necessity for improvement, were thus motivated to seek a joint solution. The details are recorded as follows:

Full Text of the Agreement: (1) After consultation between the Shanghai "Special Municipality Government" and the Shanghai Municipal Council, it is decided to establish a special police force in the Shanghai western extra-mural road area, and to establish an appropriate number of police stations and police substations in this area. All members of the police force shall wear special and distinct shoulder marks or badges. During this interim agreement, they shall be the only agency authorized to exercise police powers in the area.

(2) The number of personnel and the structure of the special police force shall be determined by the "Director of the Shanghai Special Municipality Police Bureau" in consultation with the Chief of Police of the Shanghai Municipal Council.

(3) A portion of the members of the special police force, including some senior officials, shall be appointed by the Shanghai "Special Municipality Government" from candidates recommended by the Shanghai Municipal Council.

(4) The heads of police stations in areas where foreigners have substantial property, and a number of officers determined through consultation, shall be appointed by the Shanghai "Special Municipality Government" from candidates recommended by the Shanghai Municipal Council.

(5) The Shanghai Municipal Council shall be entitled to send liaisons to cooperate with the special police force in the western Shanghai district.

(6) All cases involving foreigners shall be handled by foreign police officers recommended by the Shanghai Municipal Council and appointed by the Shanghai "Special Municipality Government."

(7) If there is disagreement between police officers recommended by the Shanghai Municipal Council and appointed by the Shanghai "Special Municipality Government" and other police officers appointed by the Shanghai "Special Municipality Government," they shall refer to the "Director of the Special Municipality Police Bureau" and the Chief of Police of the Shanghai Municipal Council for guidance on how to resolve the matter. If a resolution remains impossible and it is deemed necessary, they shall refer to the "Mayor of the Shanghai Special Municipality" and the Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council.

"Note": This interim agreement is prepared in both Chinese and English, but the interpretation and translation of all articles shall be based on the Chinese text.

Japanese Consul's Statement

Shanghai, 16th (Domei News Agency): The Shanghai "Special Municipality Government" and the Public Concession Shanghai Municipal Council today signed a temporary agreement on extra-settlement road construction in western Shanghai. The authorities of the Japanese Consulate-General in Shanghai also issued a statement expressing their pleasure at this development. At the same time, they stated that Japan is prepared to resolve the issue of the Shanghai Municipal Council police returning to the area north of the Suzhou Creek, which is particularly noteworthy. The content of the statement is as follows: The issue of police power in the extra-settlement road construction area in western Shanghai has been negotiated by the "Special Municipality Government" and the Public Concession Shanghai Municipal Council since last year. Today, an agreement has been reached on fundamental principles, deciding to establish a special police district under the Shanghai "Municipal Government" in the area. The two authorities will continue to negotiate the detailed conditions for implementing this agreement in the coming days. Japan is particularly concerned about the security situation in the area, and is very pleased that this agreement has been reached. Furthermore, Japan has been negotiating with the Public Concession Shanghai Municipal Council since last year to discuss the issue of the Shanghai Municipal Council police returning to the area north of the Suzhou Creek, in order to restore Shanghai to its original state after being in an abnormal state since 1937. An outline was agreed upon with the Shanghai Municipal Council last August, but its implementation had to be temporarily suspended due to the misconduct of Shanghai Municipal Council police officers in western Shanghai. Now that this agreement has been reached, the situation in the western Shanghai area will become clearer. Therefore, Japan is prepared to sign the agreement reached last year with the Shanghai Municipal Council as soon as possible, and to begin negotiating the necessary details for its implementation. This is hereby declared.

Details to be Discussed

According to further investigations by our reporter, this agreement will take effect immediately after it is signed. As for the number of police forces in the area, the locations of the police stations, the heads of the stations, and other senior officials, these issues will be discussed and decided by both parties in the near future. Cases involving foreigners will be handled solely by foreign police officers. The date for the establishment of police stations in the large extra-settlement road construction area is gradually approaching.

Temporary Error

The signing of the temporary agreement on police affairs for the extra-settlement roads was originally scheduled for 4:45 PM yesterday. Therefore, Frank Craven, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, and Secretary-General Fessenden had arrived promptly. Japanese Consul-General Miura also arrived at 3:50 PM. The agreement was prepared in both Chinese and English. Unexpectedly, just as the signing was about to begin, it was discovered that there were numerous errors in the English typescript of the agreement. Therefore, the staff, in a state of embarrassment, had to revise the English version. It was not until after 5:00 PM that the task was completed. Finally, the two signatories of the agreement, Craven and Fessenden, and Chuan Xiaonan, completed their mission at 6:00 PM. It is understood that the legal advisor Mr. Bolam also accompanied Craven and Fessenden yesterday, while Su Xiwun and others from Chuan's side also participated.

No Tax Involvement

Although the police affairs part of the agreement on extra-settlement roads has been temporarily concluded after the signing, the issue of foreign taxation remains completely unresolved. According to statements made by a Japanese spokesman in the press briefing last night, there is currently no decision on the issue of extra-settlement taxes.

Funding Issues

When a foreign journalist asked the Japanese spokesman whether the Japanese army would allow the special police to exercise their duties outside the extra-settlement roads, the spokesman replied, "As there have been no disputes in these areas to date, there seems to be no problem with the Japanese army being stationed there." Beyond that, he knew nothing. The spokesman also said that he had no idea who would pay for the maintenance of the police. It was also stated at the meeting that the agreement had been distributed to the consulates in Shanghai for review.

### Christian Endeavor Society to Hold Revival Meeting

The Shanghai Christian Endeavor Society will hold a joint revival meeting with various churches in Shanghai from the 18th to the 24th. Special topics will be edited. Except for the Xieqiao Sabbath Church, which will hold meetings at 3:00 PM every afternoon, sermons will be given every evening at 7:30 PM. All are welcome to attend.

### Citizens' Associations in Various Districts Urge Expansion of Rice Price Stabilization; Rice Price Stabilization Decided to Continue from the 23rd; One Yuan Per Person Changed to Sell Five and a Half Jin

The Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation, the Citizens' Associations of the 18th, 27th, 15th, 36th, 37th, and other districts, in order to urge the Rice Price Stabilization Association to expand the scope of rice price stabilization, specially informs all circles, please generously donate to the rice price stabilization fund to benefit the poor. Their announcement to all circles says, the skyrocketing of Shanghai's commodity prices poses a serious threat to middle- and lower-class citizens, especially in terms of food rice. Because other things can be saved, or may not be used, but rice cannot be lacking for a day. So there is an ancient saying, called "The people regard food as heaven." This situation, of course, cannot be allowed to continue. Therefore, first there was the joint announcement by the Concession authorities, strictly setting price limits and prohibiting hoarding and manipulation. Then various circles organized the Shanghai People's Food Regulation Association to handle the ordering of foreign rice and the matter of rice price stabilization. After the start of the market after the Spring Festival, rice prices suddenly rose sharply again. Alas, we, the common people, will have no way to survive. As an emergency measure, we can only urge the Rice Price Stabilization Committee to expand the scope of rice price stabilization to provide temporary relief. However, the losses from rice price stabilization depend on funds to be raised, so we hope that those who have the ability will generously donate, so that rice price stabilization can complete its greatest mission, which will not only benefit the poor but also benefit society and bring peace.

Second Phase of Rice Price Stabilization to Begin on the 23rd

The Shanghai Rice Price Stabilization Committee held its fifth standing committee meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday. Chairman Yu Qiaqing reported that donations received up to February 15th amounted to 567,459.43 yuan. Matters discussed: It was decided that from February 23rd, the members of the Rice Merchants Association will continue to be entrusted to handle rice sales, with a limit of one yuan per person, and each yuan will be changed to five and a half jin. Because the current rice price is increasing, calculated at five and a half jin per yuan, each shi (unit of dry measure) will lose more than seven yuan. According to this selling price, each shi will only sell for twenty-nine yuan, while the purchase cost must be more than thirty-six yuan. If calculated according to the current market price (forty yuan and eight jiao), the loss will reach ten yuan and some jiao.

Charitable Organizations Continue Relief Efforts

The Shanghai Buddhist Benevolent Association's ticket distribution and porridge distribution have been well-received by the public since their implementation. The association held a board meeting yesterday and decided to print another 10,000 porridge tickets to benefit the poor.

### Coal Merchants Refuse to Sell; Manipulation is Extremely Obvious; However, Current Coal Briquette Reserves are Very Substantial; Wealthy Households Should Not Buy Excessively to Avoid Stimulating Market Prices

The recent surge in coal briquette prices has deeply affected the citizens. In fact, Shanghai's current coal briquette reserves are very substantial and sufficient to meet the needs of the citizens. Do not be afraid that there will be a shortage, and instead be exploited by unscrupulous merchants. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation, and other public organizations, as well as major coal merchants, have recently consulted to regulate the supply, so that the selling price of coal briquettes in Shanghai can be stabilized as soon as possible. The public organizations firmly believe that, given the current coal briquette reserves and production volume, if proper regulation can be achieved in terms of supply and demand, the price of coal briquettes will soon fall. It is hoped that citizens from all walks of life will remain calm and not purchase and store excessively, which would stimulate market prices. Public organizations and coal merchants will continue to meet in the coming days to stabilize coal briquette prices in the short term.

Available But Not Sold

The prices of goods in this port have been soaring, and the threat to the lives of citizens is increasing, especially the two items of rice and coal, which are necessary for life, and the speed of their increase is even more shocking. According to investigations by reporters from the Datong News Agency, most coal briquette stores refuse to sell coal briquettes, creating a situation where they are available but not sold, with the intention of hoarding and speculating. This is obvious. Customers must purchase coal with old receipts before they will sell it to them, and new households are also refused sales. The price of coal briquettes before the war was only about nine jiao per dan (unit of weight), and the price last month was only more than three yuan. In recent weeks, it has suddenly soared, and it is very obvious that it is being manipulated. Because the market price fluctuates so quickly, the selling prices of various coal briquette merchants are quite inconsistent, and most coal briquette manufacturers follow the lead of a few manufacturers who manipulate the market price. If the authorities do not quickly suppress this, the threat to the lives of Shanghai residents will be endless and will increase day by day.

Authorities Investigate

More than 500 hot water shops in the two concessions have been severely affected by the high coal prices and have suspended business one after another. Although the industry association has held several meetings to come up with proper solutions and appealed for assistance, they have not been fully resolved even for half a month. Because the closure of hot water shops is of great importance to the entire livelihood of the people, and it is extremely inconvenient for various organizations, groups, schools, and households, the Concession authorities are paying close attention to the closure of hot water shops. Yesterday, they sent personnel to the hot water industry to investigate the reasons for the closure of hot water shops, and it is rumored that they will find ways to lower coal prices.

### Post-War Rubber Industry in Severe Decline

I recently met with someone from the rubber industry association, who said that the decline of the rubber industry this year is far beyond what outsiders can easily imagine and know. The rubber products industry in this port was at its peak in 1926 and 1927. After 1931, it gradually declined due to the January 28th Incident, partly due to post-war financial contraction and partly due to the weakness of the people's purchasing power.

Obstructed Access

It was not until one year before August 13th that there was a turning point. Unexpectedly, the August 13th Incident occurred again, and most of the factories of the industry were destroyed by artillery fire. In recent years, those who have been able to relocate to safe areas and resume operations are less than 30% of the original. Currently, including factories that have not been affected by the war, there are only a dozen or so. In the current situation, raw materials and labor costs, and the prices of all goods have skyrocketed.

After the clothes are made, transportation is inconvenient, and sales are almost impossible. The factories are able to barely work, and they are only maintaining the livelihoods of their workers. However, there are also those who cannot continue to work hard. For example, Wuhua Rubber Factory has a history of several years, and because it cannot be maintained, it has changed its brand and owner. Also, factories such as Jiaotong Yisheng are also

Operating intermittently

There is very little vigorous atmosphere. The rubber department of Yonghe Industrial Company has not recovered since the January 28th battle due to a lack of development opportunities. There is also Zhengchun Factory, which has found a new location on Wuding Road because the old factory's transportation is inconvenient, and has been preparing for a while. It is now actively producing, but the various costs have increased sharply, and transportation and sales are not easy. If production increases, not only will there be no profit, but there will also be losses, because if the selling price is too high, no one will care. If it is lowered, it will not be cost-effective, so there is a dilemma. Therefore, this year's rubber industry can be called the end of the road.

### Romanian Minister to Japan Returns to Japan from Shanghai after a Leisure Trip

The English-language Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury reported that the Romanian Minister to Japan, Mr. Bălăceanu-Stolnici, has been visiting Shanghai for several weeks and left Shanghai for Tokyo today (the 16th) aboard the President Cleveland.

### British Consul Gitson on Extended Leave

Leaves Shanghai on Sunday; To Visit Chuan Xiaonan

The English-language Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury reported that the British Consul-General in Shanghai, George, accompanied by British Consul Gitson, paid an informal visit to "Mayor" Chuan Xiaonan in the city center yesterday (the 15th). Gitson was saying goodbye to Mr. Chuan, as Mr. Gitson will be leaving Shanghai on Sunday noon for an extended leave.

### Italian Ship Passes Through Shanghai; Steel Transported to Japan

Japanese Army Heavily Buys in Europe

Since the Japanese army invaded China, the consumption and losses of materials have been very large. Therefore, in the occupied areas, it has been collecting as much steel, iron, copper, tin, lead, and other metals as possible to transport back to Japan to rush to make weapons of aggression. However, what has been scraped together is still not enough. Therefore, it has been heavily buying in various European countries. In the past, steel was directly transported to Japan, and the amount of steel that was transported to Japan via Shanghai was uncountable. Recently, an Italian ship has loaded old steel of 1,040 tons and new steel of 128 tons, totaling 1,168 tons. The goods from the ship in Shanghai have already been unloaded. It is scheduled to depart today and transport the steel to Japan for delivery.

### YMCA Organizes Deaf and Dumb Society

The Deaf and Dumb Society organized by the Shanghai Chinese Christian Association will hold its inaugural meeting at 2:30 PM today (the 17th) in the East Hall on the ninth floor of the association at Eight Immortals Bridge. The program includes a chairman's report, speeches, election of officers, a dinner, a photo session, entertainment, etc. It is reported that more than 100 people have registered to attend.

### Japanese Newspaper Advertises That a New Police District Will Be Established in Hongkou; Chinese Still Face the Danger of Arrest When Entering the Open Area; Those Landing in Pudong Must Undergo Severe Inspection

The Shanghai Times reported that the Japanese-language Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun stated yesterday morning (the 15th) that, regarding the relaxation of the Hongkou pass restrictions and the increase in the number of Japanese staff in the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department, it is expected that the Police Department will soon establish a new "Eastern District" and have a Japanese person in charge of the district. It is expected that after Shanghai Municipal Council Secretary-General and Chairman Fessenden returns to Shanghai and the Shanghai Municipal Council and the "Shanghai Municipal Government" sign the West District extra-settlement road agreement, the plan to establish a new police district will be realized.

After Hongkou, Zhabei, and Yangshupu were opened the day before yesterday, yesterday was the second day. The Wuzhen Road Bridge to Zhabei is being repaired and cannot be used. Therefore, everyone is going around the Sichuan Road Bridge. After crossing the bridge, the houses on both sides of the city are all occupied, with either military institutions or various companies, shops, and stores.

According to reports, the South City's situation is that the Japanese side's opening of a part of the Shanghai suburbs this time has special significance. In addition to the naval garrison area, which was implemented yesterday, the bustling urban area north of the Jingjieqian in the South City, although it belongs to the defense army garrison area, is said to be opened from the first day of next month. Citizens can pass without a pass. On the one hand, it will facilitate the transportation of grain from the Shanghai suburbs, which is the main food for civilians, and lower the price (at present, the price of rice in the Shanghai suburbs is up to 37 or 38 yuan per shi for domestic rice, which is more than 10 yuan different from the Concession), so that civilians in the Concession who are under the pressure of life will move to the Shanghai suburbs.

The meaning of opening up is to fulfill its ambition of "prosperity of the market." The puppet "Municipal Government" is inducing people to go to Shanghai suburbs to increase its income from miscellaneous "taxes" because its income from "taxes" is not much and it faces an economic panic. However, because the people feel that they have no legal protection on their bodies as soon as they leave the isolated island and they are in danger of being arrested at any time, the puppet "Government's" dream is still a disappointment. As for the area where the Fourth Detachment of the Japanese Navy is stationed in Pudong, the so-called "citizen card" of the "Police Bureau" was revoked from the 15th (the day before yesterday), and there are no restrictions on civilians walking in the open area.

Then the Pudong area is very narrow, as far as Zhangjiahong to the south, Yangjing Port to the east, and Putan to the west and north. The area is six Chinese miles in diameter from north to south, and nine Chinese miles in diameter from east to west, for a total of 54 Chinese square miles. Zhangjiahong faces inward to the east of Yangjing Port, and it is the Japanese Army garrison area. The river embankment is the natural boundary. Without a "citizen card," it is still not allowed to pass the river. Also, although it is called an opening, when disembarking from the ferry from the Concession to Pudong, they are still under the surveillance of the Japanese Navy at each dock and are subject to strict searches by the "unarmed police." Those who are regarded as suspicious are still subject to arrest, which is no different from when it was not open. From Yangjiadu Pier in Pudong, taking a ferry to the South City also requires carrying a "citizen card," otherwise there is a risk of being detained.

The English-language Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury reported that at 8:00 PM yesterday (the 15th), a foreigner was in the back seat of a small electric company truck and was stopped by a Japanese Army sentry near the Huishan district. The Japanese sentry spoke to the foreigner in English, stating, "The car you are riding in is driving a little too fast. If it were three months ago, we would have thrown you into the river. But today, for the sake of friendship, we are only giving you a gentle warning." The sentry then issued the same warning to the truck driver in Chinese.

### Hanwa Steamer Near Fushan Nearly Hijacked by Pirates; Two Pirates Boarded the Ship, One Killed and One Captured; The Ship Immediately Returned to Port, Both Pirates Brought to Shanghai

Since the August 13th Incident, the Yangtze River steamers of Jardine Matheson & Co. and Butterfield & Swire have stopped sailing and instead sail to downstream ports (Taizhou), Xingang (Jingjiang), Yaogang, and Tianshenggang (Tongzhou). Business is still not bad. After the Chinese army withdrew to the west, the Yangtze River was controlled by the Japanese army, and foreign merchants were viewed with jealousy. Therefore, Butterfield & Swire and Jardine Matheson changed the river steamers to sail north, and only the Wulin and Tonghe steamers are sailing, but after March of last year, they were unable to transport safely and were often obstructed. The various situations have been repeatedly reported in the newspapers. Recently,

Jardine Matheson sent another Hanwa steamer, towing two barges No. 23 and No. 24, to various ports on the Upper River, intending to solicit cargo. Unexpectedly, at 7:00 AM yesterday (the 16th), when it arrived near Fushan, a county under the jurisdiction of Changshu above Hupu, it was nearly hijacked by pirates. At the time, there was a wooden barge with two pirates. The two pirates jumped on the Hanwa steamer, holding guns. A Russian bodyguard happened to see them, and the pirate immediately asked

Where is the comprador? Although the Russian was wearing a gun, he saw that the pirate was holding a gun and did not want to draw it. He thought of a plan and replied that the comprador was in the lower cabin. Then he turned and went to the upper deck. When the two pirates saw the Russian fleeing, they immediately fired a gun but did not hit anyone. However, a Russian bodyguard on the upper deck saw the two pirates firing a gun, thinking they were bandits, and immediately drew his gun and fired three shots. One pirate was shot and killed on the spot. Another pirate was monitored by another Russian bodyguard in the lower cabin. The pirate was controlled

Unable to escape, he shouted for help. Unexpectedly, there was another barge with six or seven pirates rushing to help. The two Russians saw it and immediately opened fire to stop it. The pirate ship then escaped. The arms of the pirate on the Hanwa steamer were politely taken away by the comprador. The owner of the Hanwa steamer then ordered the ship to turn around and bring the two iron barges back to Shanghai. The two pirates, one dead and one captured, were brought to Shanghai. The ship entered port at 5:00 PM yesterday and docked at the Garden Pier. The two pirates, one dead and one alive, were taken to the Xinguang Pier by boat and handed over to the Customs Port Police Station (i.e., the Water Patrol Station) for disposal. There were two gold rings on the finger of the dead pirate.

According to foreign news, the Hanwa steamer of Jardine Matheson & Co. encountered pirates near Fushan on the Yangtze River yesterday morning. It was then intercepted by the Russian guards of the ship, and the two sides fought for two or three hours. One pirate was shot and killed on the spot, and one was captured alive. There were no deaths or injuries among the Russian guards. At that time, the pirates had once climbed the ship, but were eventually driven away. This is the first time in months that a British ship has encountered pirates.

### Commander of the US Fleet on the Luzon Heads to Wuhu; Presumably to Transport Medicines

The Continental Daily News reported that the US warship Luzon, carrying Rear Admiral John H. Newton, commander of the US Yangtze River Patrol Fleet, sailed from Shanghai on Wednesday at noon, presumably to transport medicines to Wuhu for delivery to the local American church. It is expected to return to Shanghai within the week. According to reports, the Luzon carried US Ambassador Johnson to Hankou last month for two weeks and returned here at the beginning of this month. The US warship Guam, which came to Shanghai from Hankou with the Luzon, was still docked in the port yesterday (the 15th).

### Personnel of the Puppet "Workers' Welfare Association" Rely on Strength to Assault and Injure Foreman; Shen Rongsheng Sentenced to Two Months of Imprisonment

The workers of the Dazhang Paper Mill at No. 408 Yangshupu Road recently went on strike because they demanded that the factory improve their treatment and increase their wages, but they were not successful. The "Chinese Workers' Welfare Association" at No. 127 Longjiang Road drafted 15 conditions for the labor side. At the same time, the "Association" sent representative Gao Boxi

To mediate. However, Zhang A'er, a native of Jiangbei, who lived in Dingheli, Yangshupu Road, and had been serving as a foreman in the Tianzhang Paper Mill, expressed strong dissatisfaction with the strike and strongly opposed the strike and refused to join the "Welfare Association." The "Welfare Association" found out about this, so at 6:00 PM the day before yesterday, it sent representatives Shen Rongsheng (a native of Changzhou), Yu Zhengyi, Li Qisheng, Chen Agui, Zhu Shier, and five others to Zhang's home, and

By violent means, they kidnapped Zhang to the "Association" and illegally detained him, and beat him. They also wanted to send him to the Japanese Command. When the Tianzhang Paper Mill heard about this, it reported to the Yulin Road Patrol Room, which sent detectives Wu Jiwen and Western detective Luo Si to rescue Zhang. They arrested Shen Rongsheng on the spot and took him to the Patrol Room, ordering Zhang to be sent to the Hudong Hospital, where it was verified that he had a chest injury. Yesterday morning, Shen Rongsheng was escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Patrol Room lawyer Zhang Quan'yin

Filed a lawsuit in accordance with the law and stated the circumstances. Zhang A'er also filed a complaint about being illegally detained and beaten. In response to Shen Rongsheng's questioning, his confession was evasive. Judge Xiao Peishen reviewed the confession and sentenced Shen Rongsheng to two months of imprisonment for using violent coercion to force others to do what they are not obliged to do. If he opts for a fine in lieu of imprisonment, it will be calculated at one yuan per day.



### Oil, Salt, Sauce, Vinegar, Tea, Firewood - Everything is Expensive

Oil: Currently, at retail stores, soybean oil sells for 9 jiao 9 fen per shijin (approximately 500g), raw oil for 9 jiao 6 fen, and vegetable oil for 9 jiao 8 fen. Some vendors using old scales sell soybean oil for 1 yuan 1 jiao 2 fen per jin, raw oil for 1 yuan 1 jiao 5 fen, sesame oil for 1 yuan 2 jiao, and vegetable oil for 1 yuan 0 jiao 5 fen.

Salt: The price of salt is also increasing due to supply shortages. Coarse salt currently sells at retail stores for 1 jiao 6 fen per shijin. Jing salt from Jiuda Company sells for 1 jiao 5 fen per large bag and 1 jiao 2 fen per small bag.

Sauce: The South Sichuan Sauce Garden Trade Association has increased prices starting from the 8th due to higher raw material costs. Currently, at retail stores, "Double Set Soy Sauce" sells for 27 yuan 4 jiao per zu (unit), 2 jiao 7 fen 4 li per jin; "Set Oil" sells for 22 yuan per che (unit), 2 jiao 2 fen per jin; "Mother Oil" sells for 16 yuan per dan (unit), 6 fen per jin; "Top Oil" sells for 10 yuan 0 jiao 2 fen per dan, 1 jiao 0 li per jin; "Double Sauce" sells for 28 yuan 8 jiao per dan, 2 jiao 8 fen 8 li per jin; "Sweet Sauce" sells for 28 yuan 8 jiao per dan, 8 jiao 8 fen 8 li per jin.

Vinegar: This is a secondary condiment among seasonings, so its selling price is still relatively low, currently selling for only 5 fen per jin. However, the minimum retail purchase is 1 fen.

Tea: After the "red market", prices have continued to rise. Currently, tea shops sell green tea, with Longjing tea starting at a minimum of 1 jiao to 4 or 5 jiao per liang (approximately 50g), varying in price. Red tea prices are similar. The cheapest tea leaves require at least 5 fen.

Firewood: Due to transportation disruptions and supply shortages, tree firewood currently sells for 5 yuan to 10 yuan per dan. Rice straw sells for 8 yuan per dan. Coal briquettes have increased four times in three to four days. Starting from the 12th, they sold for only 98 yuan per ton. That afternoon, the price increased by 12 yuan, selling for 110 yuan. On the 13th, it increased again by 6 yuan, on the 14th, it increased by another 6 yuan, and on the 15th, it increased by 8 yuan. In four days, the total increase was 32 yuan, causing extremely chaotic retail prices at coal shops, ranging from 6 yuan 8 jiao, 7 yuan, 7 yuan 2, and 7 yuan 4 per 100 shijin, with prices varying greatly.

### Under Speculation and Manipulation, the Gold Market Remains Chaotic - Bullish Forces are Emerging, the Upward Trend Has Been Thwarted

Yesterday's cash Shanghai gold dark market situation was unusually bewildering, with buyers following the trend, causing prices to rise and fall rapidly and unpredictably from morning to night, with a difference of 157 yuan. However, the final result showed a drop on paper, but in reality, it was just even. Initially, gold dealers were the first to buy, pushing up the price by 15 yuan, but the money changers vigorously sold, causing it to fall back immediately. Subsequently, a certain money changer bought on behalf of a Hong Kong group, and with the foreign exchange rate quite tight, plus bullish speculators taking advantage of the momentum to aggressively push up the price, it soared to an unprecedented new high of 4915 yuan. However, the good times did not last long. The foreign exchange rate suddenly reported a rebound, and gold dealers sold en masse, with retail investors rushing to sell, causing a setback of 4825 yuan. In the afternoon, due to the foreign exchange market strengthening further, the setback widened, and the price once fell to a low of 4758 yuan. Later, the foreign exchange rate remained tight, and securities firms switched from selling to buying, coupled with gold dealers and others entering again, so by the evening close, it had risen again by 4838 yuan. As a result, it closed 27 yuan lower than the previous day, but after the close, buying interest surged, pushing it up again to 4880 yuan. Later, a certain money changer sold, and the final price was 4860 yuan. The entire day's trading was extremely active, with 3300 to 3400 taels traded. Gold jewelry once reached a new high price of 495 yuan, but eventually returned to even. Customs gold remained unchanged.

The New Shanghai Gold Price is Constantly Emerging

From the morning, buyers were still eager to buy each bar (10 taels). A certain gold dealer first absorbed 10 taels from jewelry dealers for 4880 yuan, up 15 yuan from the previous day. Shortly after, a certain money changer vigorously sold over 200 taels, instantly pushing the price down by 25 yuan. A certain money changer sold 30 taels to gold dealers for 4855 yuan. Subsequently, the foreign exchange rate tightened suddenly, sellers decreased, and securities firms and another money changer aggressively pushed up the price, breaking through the 4900 yuan barrier. Securities firms bought 20 taels from money changers for 4915 yuan. Subsequently, due to the foreign exchange rate strengthening, selling pressure intensified, with jewelry dealers, gold dealers, and retail investors tending to sell. Soon, it plummeted by 90 yuan. Jewelry dealers traded 20 taels among themselves, falling to 4825 yuan. Later, a certain securities firm aggressively bought at the low price, and retail investors returned to buy again, coupled with a certain money changer also scooping up a significant amount, causing it to rebound by 70 yuan.

### Speculators Take Profits and Sell, British and American Exchange Rates Gradually Stabilize

Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: The HSBC listed exchange rates decreased. The British exchange rate decreased by 0.125, totaling 4 pence. The American exchange rate decreased by 0.1875, totaling 6.5625 yuan. The remaining rates also decreased in unison. The British and American exchange rate dark market initially seemed bullish, but then turned stable. Initially, due to the large volume of payments for foreign firm's cotton and wheat, and HSBC reversing to buy, although speculators such as Sassoon and general bullish speculators took the opportunity to take profits and sell, the funds were still insufficient. By 9:20, the price had tightened to 4.125 pence and 6.75 yuan, the tightest prices this year. As the number of buyers gradually decreased, coupled with speculators continuing to sell, the market gradually returned to even. By the noon close, it was 4.7875 pence and 6.84375 yuan. The early afternoon was very calm, but later, with Hong Kong telegrams slightly disrupted and Chinese merchants selling again, the market hardened to 4.203125 pence and 6.9375 yuan. Later, due to foreign firms from Britain and the United States having a good appetite for purchases, by the evening close, it was only reported at 4.15625 pence and 6.84375 yuan. As a result, it was 0.03125 more bullish than the previous day. The potential of futures remained no different from spot prices.

HSBC Listed Exchange Rates Decreased Again

Initially in the morning, the London long-term rate decreased by approximately 0.0615, the long-term rate remained flat, the New York silver price remained flat, and London raw gold remained unchanged. The exchange rate of British currency to American currency and to French currency were both flat. The exchange rate to Shanghai decreased by 0.0625. The exchange rate of American currency to British currency fell by half a cent, the exchange rate to Shanghai decreased by 0.15 yuan, and the exchange rate to French currency decreased by a small amount of 0.025. The central listed exchange rates remained the same. The opening selling prices of spot goods in the bank in the morning were 4.1875 pence for British currency and 6.875 yuan for American currency, with no gain or loss compared to the previous close. After the opening, foreign firms' cotton and wheat payments remained strong, and HSBC reversed to buy, although profit-taking speculators such as Sassoon and Chinese merchants took the opportunity to sell in large quantities, funds were still difficult to balance, causing the market to suddenly tighten. It was estimated that the foreign firms settled the purchase of American currency in March at 6.71875 yuan. At the same time, Sassoon sold British currency in February at 4.1875 pence to foreign firms, and Chinese merchants sold American currency in the current month at 6.875 and 6.84375 yuan to foreign firms at a profit. Afterwards, HSBC would buy the American currency of its peers in the current month at the tightest price of 6.75 yuan. At 9:20, the spot price had also softened to 4.125 pence and 6.75 yuan. The HSBC listed rates were announced, with British currency decreasing by 0.125 and American currency decreasing by a small amount of 0.1875. The white silver balance tax was announced to fall by 0.025. Afterwards, the foreign firms' appetite for purchases had been satiated, and HSBC's intention to buy turned weak, while the bullish Chinese merchants continued to close positions, so the funds suddenly felt oversupplied, and the market gradually rebounded. It was estimated that Chinese merchants settled the sale of American currency in the current month at 6.8125 yuan and American currency in March at 6.75 yuan to a certain bank. At that time, the spot price of British currency had reported 4.1875 pence, and the American currency had also reached 6.875 yuan. At noon, the buying and selling were even, and the situation was particularly flat. By the close, British currency was 4.171875 pence and American currency was 6.84375 yuan, slightly tighter by 0.015625 and 0.03125 compared to the morning opening.

The Result is Still Slightly Tighter Than Before

The market was initially quite stagnant. Around 3:00, due to telegrams from Hong Kong arriving with sales, and speculators continuing to sell, although foreign firms still had an appetite for purchases, they all took advantage of the momentum to raise prices, so it hardened slightly. It was estimated that speculators sold American currency in the current month to foreign firms at 6.90625 yuan, and Hong Kong telegrams sold spot British currency at 4.1875 pence to the Macaulay firm. The tightest price had called for 4.103125 pence and 6.9375 yuan. As the selling gradually subsided, and foreign firms still had an appetite for purchases, the situation turned soft, and by the evening close, British currency was 4.5625 pence, and American currency was 6.84375 yuan. The current month was the same as the above price, the next month's futures were 4.09375 pence for British currency and 6.71875 yuan for American currency. As a result, the spot and American currency were each 0.03125 tighter than the previous day.

### Securities, Domestic Debt Transactions are Slightly Dull, Foreign Stocks are Rising

Yesterday's securities dark market situation: The trend went from weak to firm, and transactions gradually became sluggish. Most major players were standing still, and retail investors were slightly covering positions. People were feeling slack, and buying and selling were not enthusiastic. After the red market's goods and materials soared, speculators abandoned this and turned to other things. The government bond market then turned dull again. It is currently waiting for the formal establishment of the Sino-American loan, which should bring a surge of activity. Yesterday morning's half-day trading was only over 300,000 yuan, and most of it was internal trading, accounting for the majority. There were only a small number of customer transactions. Type A had broken through 7 yuan, and Type C had retreated into 47 yuan, then came back out again, slowly becoming firmer. As a result, Type A was up a maximum of 4.5 jiao, with the rest up from a small amount to 3.5 jiao. The market closed at noon. A brief table is listed below.

Stock Transactions: 100 shares of the Great China Match Company were traded at a price of 22 yuan.

The Public Industry Association stock market remained extremely firm and active, with the turnover being large. Some stocks have even reached new highs. Due to the tight market prices, there is also strong interest in leather stocks. The shares of industries surged dramatically, with Jardine Matheson, Wheelock, and International Trust among the leaders.

### Yarn and Cotton, Cotton Yarn Jumps Wildly, Also Sets a New Record

The Futures Market Once Opened at 890 Yuan

Causing a Massive Sell-Off in the Market for Profit Taking

The yarn market opened with a jump, discovering a new record in the history of the yarn industry. The price of 20-count Shuangma yarn for February reached 890 yuan, an increase of 30 yuan compared to the previous year's peak price of 860 yuan. As soon as this price opened, general profit-takers seized the opportunity to close their positions one after another, and the market quickly declined again. Daily sales remained sluggish and unremarkable. Although people were unusually enthusiastic, those who were dragging in goods were still unwilling to give up. According to the market situation, it rises and falls from time to time, and it is extremely chaotic.

The spot yarn market opened in the morning, because the price of gold had soared in the afternoon of the previous day, people's hearts were agitated, and buying sentiment was strong. The opening price of 20-count Shuangma yarn for the current month immediately reached 890 yuan, and the spot price was 880 yuan. Then, as profit-takers in the same industry closed their positions according to the market, the market suddenly loosened and fell straight to 850 yuan. Part of it then came back to pull in, and it rose again, and when it reached the close, because the amount of selling by the bulls was even greater, it still returned to almost flat weakness, but after closing and consolidation, it was seen to rise again. It was found that the trading statistics for half a day were 3,275 bales, and the market price of 20-count Shuangma yarn rose by 6 yuan. The amount bought by each gang is listed as follows:

Same Industry: 3,190 Hong Kong: 45

Inland: 20 Ningbo: 20

Total: 3,275

### Cotton Prices Have Reached a Peak, Transactions are Also Becoming Slack

The trading of this cotton is less, and people's hearts are still firm. People in the same industry have better ideas. This is because the sources of supply from various places are declining, and the local inventory is becoming increasingly thin, so those who hold the goods will not sell them unless at a high price. In addition, the yarn market is rising, and factories are about to take action, but there is still a shortage of supply. The amount bought by each gang is listed as follows:

Another Message Foreign cotton market prices: The New York cotton market was initially firmer this morning, but later, due to public selling, the market turned weak. As a result, closing prices fell by two pounds compared to the previous day. India, including forecasts, rose by more than one rupee, Egypt rose by more than ten pounds, and Liverpool was closed.

Yesterday, the exchange rate in the Shanghai foreign cotton transaction had fallen to a low price, and all parties had already considered the price of raw cotton to have reached its peak, so purchases had turned slightly sluggish, and transactions were not as lively as in previous days. With the current cotton prices, factories have calculated that the cost of cotton yarn is much more expensive than the market price of yarn, so they are unwilling to search for cotton, or to open cotton yarn. Therefore, factory transactions are abnormally quiet. The following is the price of the cotton market yesterday, converted into the factory price with an American exchange rate of 6.875 yuan.

### Letter

To the Editor: I recently read the article "The Shanghai Financial Industry in Early 1940" in the Commercial News section of the February 12th issue of your newspaper, and the footnote stated that "all of the above banks except... Nanjing Commercial Bank, etc., are members of the Bankers' Association." After investigating, our bank is a member of the Bankers' Association, and the information in the article is inaccurate. I am extremely surprised and hope that you will correct it on our behalf. Sincerely, Shanghai Branch of Nanjing Commercial Savings Bank, February 16th, 29th Year.

### Uneven Nutrition

— Huang Jiayin

The lack of talent and the large number of unemployed people are a major loophole in the current society. This contradictory phenomenon is not only worthy of attention, but also a rather serious social pathology.

The American magazine "American Magazine" recently solicited the opinions of 300 of the most famous industrial and commercial leaders in the country, asking them whether the industrial and commercial circles currently need people, and what kind of talent is needed. The answers obtained were almost completely consistent. They all believe that the industrial and commercial sectors are in urgent need of people, and what is needed is specialized technical talent who can humbly learn and are willing to work hard. According to statistics, the United States needed about 2 million talents in 1940.

The alarming fact is that although the American industrial and commercial circles need talent so much, there are a large number of people in the country who are unemployed and idle at home, receiving government relief. This is not only a major loss to the national society, but also a major tragedy of the current social system.

It is said that the best students in American universities have already been recruited; and only one in 25 ordinary office clerks is qualified. It can be seen that some of the currently unemployed people are due to their own lack of ability, which should be remedied by hard work and self-study. However, there are also some people who have the will but lack the power. Although they are determined to improve, they cannot receive higher education and training due to economic reasons. It is practically impossible for them to become specialized technical talents. In this regard, the impracticality of modern education is probably also partly responsible.

What afflicts the current society is the problem of uneven nutrition.

### Vocational Clinic

— Qing

In the Soviet Union, where unemployment is not a problem, a system that has been quite effective in "how to bridge the gap between school education and professional life" has been implemented. This is the Soviet Union's youth "Vocational Clinic."

In the Soviet Union, a novel and sophisticated system of vocational guidance for young people has been considerably developed. When young people have completed their school courses and are preparing to choose a career, they have acquired extensive knowledge of various industrial sectors. This knowledge includes how to print books, how to bind books; how to spin, how to manufacture fabrics; how to prepare wood and preserve wood; including an understanding of all kinds of machines and their applications. In agriculture, they are familiar with spring planting and autumn planting in vegetable gardens, familiar with the raising of pigs and rabbits, and familiar with the working steps of collective farms and state-owned farms.

Every school has a relationship with nearby factories, farms, or machine stations, so that every student gets a chance to practice. After seven years of preliminary training, students are eligible to enter factory schools. Factory schools are attached to various specialized factories, and last for two years. The purpose is to enable students to acquire both theoretical knowledge and practical experience at the same time. In factory schools, students spend half of their time engaged in practical work and half of their time engaged in book research.

Every factory school has an important carrying equipment, which is the "Vocational Clinic." In other words, various specialized factories, in addition to setting up factory schools, also set up "Vocational Clinics." There is one psychologist for every 450 students. This psychologist must have the qualifications of graduating from a specialized college and having more than three years of teaching experience.

The purpose of the vocational clinic is to study the whole personality of children seeking work in factory schools, that is, the personality including genetic factors and environmental factors. Each child, whether male or female, is approached individually. In order to provide a basis for different teachings, teachers must know the different personalities of each child in their class. The records of each student kept in the central diagnostic department include his health condition, his various tests, the information about the external environment found by the psychologist during his first meeting with him, family background, relationship with parents and friends, what kind of books he reads, what kind of clubs he participates in, and his interests and knowledge of various occupations.

The vocational clinic administers various vocational tests to each child to indicate his various characteristics in his career, such as independence, etc. For students coming from outside Moscow, special attention is paid to their work in previous schools and the opinions of their previous teachers. One of the greatest functions of the Vocational Clinic is: adjusting the attitudes and realities of children, families and schools. Make a very thorough study of children's interests and abilities. If a child feels unpleasant or unsuitable for work in a certain factory school, the guidance department will transfer him to another factory school for readjustment.

After living in the factory school for two months, students must write a paper describing their impressions of the factory school. The vocational clinic has consultants who specialize in analyzing these papers, and the results of the analysis often lead to changes in teaching methods and sometimes even changes in factory equipment. These consultants often meet with the children's parents so that they can gain a deeper understanding of their children's ideals and interests.

### Pearl S. Buck on Books

— Hua Zhi

"It is meaningless to read this book because others love to read it. I am willing to destroy all statistics on the world's best-selling books. The sales volume of any book, even in advertising, should be kept strictly secret, allowing readers to test their vision."

The above are the recent remarks of the American contemporary novelist Pearl S. Buck. Because according to the latest statistics from the New York book industry, her many novels and essays with China as the background occupy the first place in sales. Some people praised the excellence of her works, resulting in such satisfactory results. But she couldn't help but say the opposite.

Pearl S. Buck does not think that the best-selling of works must be a sign of substantial content. Many are because of the psychology of being shocked by the author's name, forming a kind of fashionable psychology. She herself admitted that none of the writer's products are entirely worth seeing. As far as she is concerned, the initial works are "The Good Earth", etc., which are indeed driven by interest; but later, under the urging of painting and silk, they are gradually regarded as commodities. In the commercial American society, any writer cannot be avoided.

Last year, Pearl S. Buck was stunned by the news that she had been awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature and could not believe it. What she was worried about was the increasing sloppiness of her works, which would arouse possible condemnation from the public opinion circles. She did not expect that it would increase an unexpected honor.

However, Pearl S. Buck is different from ordinary profit-seeking booksellers after all. She does not want readers to blindly buy any best-selling books. She wants readers to release their selective vision and determine the readings that are most valuable in their minds. In a Chinese society with a broad readership, Pearl S. Buck's views are indeed quite applicable.

Miscellaneous Feelings

### Boredom

— Lei Xing

The first thing you always ask when you meet a friend is, "What have you been up to lately?" The answer is often the same, a blunt, "I'm so bored." There's even a hint of a smile on their lips.

Humans are truly strange creatures, deceiving themselves and yet feeling satisfied and proud. All those friends mentioned above hope to live for many more years. But, when I think about it for them, I truly feel sad. I want to shout aloud, "This is a waste of life, a shameful waste!"

I don't understand: Why would anyone let boredom entangle them? The world is so vast, isn't there so much that can be done? Cruel time will bury people; shouldn't we cherish our years?

There are many great figures in the world; they have already presented precious things to humanity. Yet, when they are on their deathbeds, they still say: I want to live. This clinging to life moves us.

Life is not about "passing the days." It should have meaning. The biggest question before you and me is "How should we live?"

Going back against the river of time, take out your own "record" and see what you've written? Or is it still a blank page?

The joy of life comes from a rich and fulfilling life. A faint smile after a job well done, how relaxing! That is something that money cannot buy. First, we must throw away boredom; we must "have something to talk about."

Young friends, remember: life should have a meaning, stop saying you are bored.

### Invisible Glass

— Langhua

Dr. Bailu Qituo, a female doctor in New York, USA, recently invented a drug that, when applied to glass, can make it completely invisible.

When light passes through ordinary glass, only 92% can pass through, but when the drug invented by Ms. Bai is applied to the glass, the light that passes through reaches 99%.

Glass coated with this drug no longer reflects light, no matter how strong the light is. Clocks, shops, residences, etc., equipped with this kind of glass look as if there is no glass at all. If it is made into glasses, then people will no longer suffer from the inconvenience of light reflection.

Photography will also be greatly improved as a result. In the past, even with the best lenses, 8% of the light was lost. As for poorer lenses, only 25% to 35% of the light could reach the film. But since applying the drug to both sides of the lens, all the above shortcomings have completely disappeared.

The method of making this drug is quite secret. All we know is that it requires as many as six or seven kinds of raw materials. After the drug is made, it can be stored for a very long time.

However, after dyeing the glass slide with the drug, it must be immersed in an acidic solution in order to achieve satisfactory results.

### Economic Straits, Inability to Replicate: Japan Bans Color Films

— Huazhi

Since the invasion of China, the film industry in Japan has been declining day by day. In order to save foreign exchange expenditures, the government has tightened the import ban on Western films. All the films shown in the cinemas are second- and third-rate films, and there is not a single great film. Movie fans feel extremely disappointed. In previous years, Japan screened no less than several hundred American films every year. Since the war, restrictions have been implemented. Last year, only 150 films were allowed to be imported, and this year it has been reduced to 80 films, which are evenly distributed by the eight Hollywood film companies stationed in Japan, with only ten films being allocated to each company. Moreover, each film is only allowed to import one copy. If there are not enough copies in Japanese cinemas, the other copies need to be printed in Japan, in order to recover some rights and interests for the country, which is really a helpless thing.

However, the Japanese are indeed better at imitating ordinary black and white films, but they have no way to deal with giant color films. Because color films have exclusive distribution rights in the United States. Compared with ordinary films, they have eight more production procedures, and Japan simply does not have such equipment. The most important thing is the import problem, because the transmission and sound of color films are in five parts which are a group, one cannot be missed. Therefore, importing one color film becomes five films, and ten films becomes fifty films.

Hollywood film merchants will discuss with the Japanese authorities a flexible way to import color films. It is said that each color film will be taxed at the value of five films, and will also be charged for the inspection fees of five films, and will also be subject to the editing procedures of five films. In this way, even if a color film is lucky enough to be released, the seat price will have to be increased four times and it cannot be guaranteed that the projection will be satisfactory. No wonder American film merchants sigh in despair, calling this method "unheard of in the world."

Since Japan has banned color films, the fifty giant color films that are now popular all over the world will no longer have the opportunity to meet with Japanese movie fans. The giant color films they most desire, such as Snow White, Robin Hood, The Little Princess, Gone with the Wind, and Pinocchio, can only be sighed at from afar.

### Hu Die Returns to the Screen

"Peerless Beauty" Scheduled for Release

China's biggest star, Hu Die, has been away from movie fans for a long time, but now she is returning to the screen, which is not only the glory of Chinese cinema, but also a good news for moviegoers!

Ms. Hu's work to return to the screen this time is called "Peerless Beauty." It is a moving story about the life of Chen Yuanyuan, a beautiful school scribe in the late Ming Dynasty. This is Hu Die's first time acting in a costume drama, and she plays the daughter who is unwilling to serve the enemy. Every move and every smile of hers will surely make every audience member move with her performance.

"Peerless Beauty" is indeed an epoch-making masterpiece in the history of Chinese cinema. The talents included in this film, such as director Wang Jue Long, and stars such as Wang Yin, Wang Naidong, Jiang Junchao, and Bai Lu, are all the best choices. The photography and sound recording are enough to compete with imported films. The scenery is magnificent, antique, and extremely beautiful. It is the only thing seen in all past costume films. The capital spent on this aspect alone has reached 100,000 yuan.

"Peerless Beauty" is produced by Huaxin and is scheduled to be screened at the New Light Grand Theater on the evening of the 21st. We are willing to sincerely recommend it to the audience. We believe that this film will definitely give the audience a refreshing experience.

The train started, and the naughty kids cheered in the car, heading for Happy Island. When they arrived at the beach, they and their car took a ferry to the island. From a distance, they could hear the band on the shore playing a welcome song, making a lot of noise. As soon as they landed, the mayor of Happy Island was even more attentive, shouting "Play! Play!" to welcome them.

Happy Island seemed really nice. Everywhere there were candy trees, candy houses, ice cream mountains, and the water in the streams was all lemonade. By the shore grew fluffy cattails, which were actually chocolate. These unmanaged wild children were even more absurd and outrageous here. Breaking windows, burning books, they did almost everything. Pinocchio met a little bad boy nicknamed Lampwick. Lampwick was the king of these black sheep, and he always led the way in mischief. Pinocchio spent every day in their ranks, avoiding meeting his "conscience." (6).

On Happy Island

Jiminy Cricket found the crossroads late at night. He saw Pinocchio had fallen into the hands of those two swindlers again. There was a four-wheeled carriage parked there, full of noisy, dirty, naughty children (Pinocchio was of course among them). When Jiminy Cricket arrived, the carriage was about to leave. He bitterly persuaded the puppet. Would he listen? No way, he had no choice but to jump into the carriage and go with them.

### Unofficial Records of the Pear Garden

Female Actors Should Not Sing "Yu Tang Chun" While Dressed Lightly

Insiders have a saying: "A qīngshānzi [female role] never freezes to death, a painted face never gets hot." This means that when singing a Qingyi role, even in the dead of winter when there is ice and snow on the ground, one must still wear a silk shirt and single pants on stage. It is absolutely impossible to wear a cotton-padded jacket and pants underneath. Conversely, those who play the Da Hualian or Hualian roles cannot remove the padded jacket inside the python robe and arrow jacket in the hottest weather when they are sweating like rain. Sometimes, an arrow jacket is added on top of the padded jacket, with pleats lining the arrow jacket, and then a python robe and jade belt are added on top. The head is also wearing a heavy helmet such as a Shuikui [general's helmet], Fuzikui [scholar's helmet], or golden or silver metal decorations. Before even trying hard, one is already drenched in sweat and unbearably hot. Moreover, even though the painted face is covered in sweat, one cannot wipe it with a towel. Traditionally, the actor playing the Hualian role must wear a padded jacket to show his mighty and majestic appearance. The problem of whether it is hot or not can only be ignored. Another thing is that actors playing other roles can sometimes sit down and rest on stage (in scenes where they should be seated), but the Hualian can only rest his buttocks on the seat with a very high cushion, which is no different from standing there. As for martial dramas, when fighting starts, one has to wear a padded jacket and fight vigorously, which is even hotter.

When singing a Qingyi role, in order to show a graceful and delicate posture, one naturally cannot dress in a bloated manner. Chinese women have always considered being frail and delicate as a condition of beauty. If one wears a cotton-padded coat underneath, it will affect the beauty of the figure, making the posture clumsy or the stage steps inflexible. Therefore, even in the severe winter, one must still perform on the red carpet in single pants and a single shirt. The outer Qing Rouzi [outer garment] is also made of silk, and the white silk skirt underneath cannot be relied upon for warmth. Moreover, the old theaters were drafty in all directions. If one were to encounter a scene like "Teaching the Son" or "Offering Sacrifice at the Pagoda" or "Offering Sacrifice to the River," performing the slow-paced erhuang or three-eyed fan erhuang, standing straight without any movements or steps, and shouting into the wind for a long time, wouldn't one freeze to death?
