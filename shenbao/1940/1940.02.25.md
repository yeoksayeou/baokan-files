### Closer Understanding Between the Central Government and the Communist Party; Rumors That the Two Sides Will Soon Sign an Agreement; The Strength of the Communist Army Set at Six Divisions

Chongqing, According to sources from various Chinese circles here, the Central Government and the Chinese Communist Party are expected to reach a closer understanding and eliminate occasional frictions between local military authorities in the Northwest provinces and the Communist Party authorities after conducting talks on several cases of differing opinions between the two sides. It is widely rumored that the two sides will soon sign an agreement. It is said that one of the biggest points of contention discussed is the size of the Chinese Communist Army. Since the Xi'an Incident, the Chinese Communist Army has been incorporated into the Central Government Army, known as the Eighth Route Army, with a strength of one army corps. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the Eighth Route Army has recruited many irregular troops with inferior equipment. It was later felt necessary to reorganize its organization. After much discussion, it was finally decided that the strength of the Communist Army would be six divisions. According to the compromise reached after the Xi'an Incident, the maintenance expenses for one army corps of the Communist Army were paid by the Central Government on a regular basis. However, since the reorganization of the Eighth Route Army, the Central Government has agreed to provide funds to maintain six divisions, on the condition that the Communist Army abides by the Central Government's regulations regarding organization and discipline. Furthermore, the Communist Army is not allowed to increase its strength or organize a "Joint Army." Another major point of contention to be resolved is the scope of the Chinese Communist Party's administrative area. At the time of the Xi'an Incident, the Communist Party only controlled three counties in northern Shaanxi. However, since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, its controlled territory has expanded. For the sake of facilitating military operations, the Central Government has transferred several counties in northern Shaanxi to the jurisdiction of the Communist Army, but at the same time, the Communist Army has agreed not to expand its activities beyond its current occupied areas.

### Mother of Guerrilla Fighters, Old Mrs. Zhao, Receives Reporters in Chongqing; To Go to Jiangjin, Hejiang, and Other Counties Tomorrow for Three Months of Military Service Propaganda

Chongqing, At 2:00 PM on the 24th, the Mother of Guerrilla Fighters, Old Mrs. Zhao, spoke freely about her impressions of coming to Sichuan and her future work plans at a reception for reporters. Old Mrs. Zhao said, "I never imagined that I, an old woman from the villages of Changbai Mountain, would have such good fortune to come to Sichuan, the base of national revival, and meet compatriots whose language and customs are not quite the same. When I first set foot on this naturally rich land, the first people I came into contact with were the women of Sichuan. From their sincere conversations, I heard their patriotic fervor, and from their arduous work, I saw their great dedication to the motherland, which deeply moved me. The purpose of my coming to Sichuan is to report to the women of Sichuan the experience I gained in the Northeast and North China in participating in the volunteer army, as well as the brutality of the Japanese army. I was originally an illiterate village woman. Because I witnessed the brutality of the Japanese army and their ambition to destroy my compatriots, I was unwilling to be a slave of a conquered nation and was willing to fight the Japanese army to the death. I fought guerrilla warfare with the Japanese army for seven years, donating my family property to the country and my children and grandchildren to the country to resist the cruel Japanese army. I was unwilling for my family property to be taken by the Japanese army and my children and grandchildren to be slaves of the Japanese army. Therefore, I took resistance against Japan as my life and career, and took the army as my family and school, in order to seek the survival of our Chinese nation. In order to convey these experiences and lessons learned from life to my compatriots in Sichuan, I have decided to conduct three months of military service propaganda in Jiangjin, Hejiang, Luxian, Longchang, Neijiang, Zigong, Zizhong, Ziyang, Jianyang, Chengdu, Rongchang, Yongchuan, Bishan, Baxian and other places, and to visit the wounded soldiers in my spare time, so that mothers can encourage their sons to join the army, wives can encourage their husbands to fight, and men and women, young and old, can do what they should do within their own duties. I am scheduled to depart on the 26th, accompanied by Mr. Liu Fengji and Mr. Qiao Yuelin." In addition, Mr. Hu Juewei, Director of the Civil Affairs Department of Sichuan Province, has telegraphed the county magistrates of various counties to assist Old Mrs. Zhao in her propaganda work. (Dispatch from the 24th)

Chongqing, The Mother of the Volunteer Army, Old Mrs. Zhao, recently issued a statement saying, "Compatriots across the country, my son Zhao Liansheng was killed in action fighting the Japanese after the 'September 18th' Incident in Xiuyan, Liaoning. My second son, Zhao Liankui, sacrificed himself in battle with the Japanese army in eastern Liaoning last spring. My godson, Miao Kexiu, was forced to surrender by the Japanese army in Fenghuangcheng but refused and died heroically. My third son, Zhao Tong, and my nineteen-year-old daughter, Zhao Meirong, are currently fighting the war of resistance in Hebei. There has been no news from them for a month, and there are also unfortunate rumors. Now, there is still a fourteen-year-old son and two sixteen- and seventeen-year-old daughters in my family, and I am ready to dedicate them all to the country to fight the Japanese army to the death. I am an old village woman. In principle, I should be saddened by the death of my sons, but although I have shed tears of pain, my heart is not bitter, because I have a greatest hope in my heart: that everyone will dedicate their children to the country and drive the Japanese army out beyond the Yalu River. At that time, when we recover our homeland, I can lead my surviving children back to our old home in the Northeast." Finally, she expressed her indignation at the draft agreement with Japan.

Editorial

### Japanese Naval Ambitions and China

According to recent dispatches from Tokyo, the Japanese government has drawn up plans to develop aviation and maritime transport, attempting to extend its economic power to Nanyang; yesterday's dispatch from Tokyo also stated that Japanese Viscount Inoue advocated that Japan expand its economy in the Philippine Islands, and that Japan is the best friend and guardian of the Philippine Islands. This clearly shows how rampant Japan's desire for "Southern Advance" is. This newspaper has previously commented on this matter, and now we will try to elaborate further.

Japan's southern advance policy has long been carefully planned, and especially recently, its ambition has become even more vigorous due to the European war. Originally, before the Sino-Japanese War, when the Japanese army was plotting to advance into North China and Mongolia, the Japanese naval authorities declared that they must develop Nanyang, advocating the "Northern Defense and Southern Advance" policy; its important reasons are two: First, in order for Japan to launch aggression and seize material and markets, expanding southward is not only in line with the needs of strategy and national defense, but also a shortcut to solving economic difficulties; as long as Japan can rule Nanyang, it can guarantee a sufficient supply of raw materials and food such as rice, coal, oil, cotton, iron ore, wool, rubber, etc.; on the one hand, Japanese goods will have a vast market for dumping, and all shipbuilding and fishing industries will be developed healthily, and the problem of overpopulation can also be solved to a considerable extent. Second, Japan's annual naval expenses are extremely large, but in the development of the continental policy, the navy only has a passive role; that is, it only takes the protection of the army's transportation as its sole mission; in contrast, it seems that the navy is not as important to Japan as the army, but only an appendage of the army, which is absolutely unacceptable to the naval authorities, Therefore, the "Southern Advance" policy should be actively established to give full play to the navy's independent strategy.

After the September 18th Incident, it seemed that Japan's development on the continent would naturally curb his desire and possibility to expand to the ocean, thinking that his ambitions and strength would not allow him to advance in both the north and the south at the same time; this is an incorrect prejudice. In fact, Japanese aggressionism is to realize the annexation of China, dominate East Asia, and control the Pacific Ocean as several aspects advancing simultaneously in its entire aggression plan, and will never relax other aspects because of the aggression against China.

The ambition of the Japanese navy has always been focused on the south. In terms of historical background and geographical situation, Japan, after Toyotomi Hideyoshi conquered the warring heroes in his country and completed the feudal unification, had already sent envoys to Nanyang to trade. In the early days of the Tokugawa shogunate, it also sent so-called imperial seal ships to Nanyang to try to trade. However, because Japan was superstitious about official power and military force, and always regarded the normal commercial power of the people as an appendage, it simply gave up doing business where official power and military force could not reach; therefore, the achievements of the Japanese authorities in developing southward in the past were far less than those of overseas Chinese, let alone the later implementation of the isolationist policy, which made Japan almost isolated from Nanyang. By the time of the Meiji Restoration, after the complete unification of the national state, the construction of capitalism and the aggression of imperialism, it once again developed outwards; at that time, what Japan possessed was only the Ogasawara Islands. By the end of the nineteenth century, it successively seized China's Ryukyu Islands, Taiwan, and Penghu Islands; Japan has since had an important base for expanding the South Pacific. At the end of the First World War, the Treaty of Versailles stipulated that the Marshall Islands, the Mariana Islands, the Caroline Islands, and Yap Island, etc., originally belonging to Germany north of the Pacific equator, were entrusted to Japan by the League of Nations; thus, the position of Japanese imperialism in the South Pacific was further strengthened. By March 1933, although Japan withdrew from the League of Nations, the League of Nations did not have the courage to withdraw its mandated rule; and it almost acquiesced to Japan's establishment of fortresses and all military defense works within the scope of the mandated territory. With such ostrich policy, Japan has laid the cornerstone for the Southern Advance.

The islands of Nanyang have long been divided by countries such as Britain, the United States, France, and the Netherlands. If the Japanese navy wants to invade the south and actively promote the "Southern Advance" policy, it will inevitably have sharp conflicts with countries such as Britain, the United States, France, and the Netherlands. Britain and the Netherlands will naturally not give up their interests in the South Pacific and East Indian colonies. The United States will not give up its privileges in the Philippines, and France will not give up its rights and interests in Annam; Britain will not willingly sever its lifeline to satisfy Japan's desires. The completion of the Singapore Great Naval Dockyard, as well as the recent construction of huge warships by the United States and the Netherlands, are enough to prove how they are all engaged in strict precautions against the ambitions of the Japanese navy. Observing these situations from the surface, it seems that the expansion of the Japanese navy's power and the implementation of the "Southern Advance" policy have a relatively shallow stake in China, while the relationship with countries such as Britain, the United States, France, and the Netherlands is relatively deep: In other words, Japan's southern advance target is not China, but the powers of Britain, the United States, France, and the Netherlands in the South Pacific. However, if we make further inferences: China only stands in an adversarial position against Japan's northern advance continental policy; for Japan's actions in the southern advance, China does not need to pay too much attention because it is not the first to bear the brunt; however, in order to preserve their vested interests in Nanyang and confront Japanese aggressionism, countries such as Britain, the United States, France, and the Netherlands must realize that the most effective barrier to preserving Nanyang is the strength of China. In other words, if China is controlled by Japan, then Britain, the United States, France, and the Netherlands will not be able to preserve Nanyang in the end; therefore, although China does not need to combine with Britain, the United States, France, and the Netherlands to oppose Japan's southern advance, in order to confront Japan's southern advance, Britain, the United States, France, and the Netherlands must first directly help China's war of resistance and national construction to become strong. Indirectly, that is, to maintain their safety in Nanyang!

### U.S. State Department Maintains a Cautious Attitude Toward Japan: Watching the Senate Foreign Relations Committee's Discussions; Spiritual Embargo to Be Intensified; Japanese Newspapers Point Out the Unfriendly Attitude of the United States

Washington – U.S. Secretary of State Hull stated yesterday that he was very satisfied with the opinions of various senators on the proposal to halt trade with Japan and believed that the Senate Foreign Relations Committee would make a decision on this matter in the near future. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee is discussing this issue at every weekly meeting, so the government is paying close attention to the daily actions and attitudes of the Japanese. The State Department will not take any action until the Senate Foreign Relations Committee makes a decision to avoid causing excessive resentment from the Japanese. According to observers, Hull does not currently want Congress to immediately grant him full authority, as such a move would create difficulties for him. The American people undoubtedly have great expectations of the State Department, hoping for immediate action; conversely, the State Department, standing in the government's position, cannot take drastic action immediately. (United Press, 24th)

Washington – On December 20th of last year, the State Department advised all domestic manufacturers not to provide any blueprints, tools, or other technical knowledge related to the refining of high-grade gasoline for aircraft to countries that use aircraft to bomb civilians. Regarding this matter, after repeated meetings, the authorities of various American oil companies have decided to suspend technical assistance to Japan and the Soviet Union in refining high-grade gasoline. Petroleum industry insiders also stated that this kind of "spiritual embargo" measure may be further intensified in the short term. Recently, congressmen from the western states have been complaining about the continuous export of American oil to Japan, and experts on national defense issues are also feeling uneasy due to the drastic increase in quantity compared to before. Therefore, various oil companies will consider the issue of prohibiting the transportation of aviation gasoline to these countries and believe that Congress will definitely do its best to support this proposal. (Havas, 23rd)

Washington – Following the announcement by the Japanese Foreign Ministry that Foreign Minister Arita intends to reopen negotiations with U.S. Ambassador to Japan Grew, diplomatic circles here do not consider it unexpected, only stating that the United States remains constantly in a wait-and-see attitude. Regarding the damages suffered by American residents in China due to the Sino-Japanese War, although the Japanese government has recently agreed to compensate for several cases, there are still many to be resolved, and their nature is far more important. Furthermore, although the Japanese government's promise to open the lower reaches of the Yangtze River is related to American commercial affairs in China, in terms of its importance, it is not sufficient to prompt the U.S. government to change its current attitude, which is to say, the attitude based on the Washington Nine-Power Treaty. (Havas, 23rd)

Philadelphia, USA – Retired U.S. Marine Corps officer Major Carlson recently delivered a speech at the Foreign Policy Association here, requesting the Senate and House of Representatives to authorize President Roosevelt to implement an embargo against Japan at any time. He stated, "Japan relies entirely on our country's supplies to carry out the war against China. Therefore, even if our country implements an embargo, that country may not dare to fight us. In short, our country should make Japan believe that we will never forgive countries that adopt aggression as their national policy." (Havas News Agency, 23rd)

Tokyo – The Hochi Shimbun stated that recent broadcasts and speeches by Pittman, advocating for an embargo against Japan and strengthening the U.S. Pacific Fleet, undoubtedly indicate that the United States' attitude will be stubbornly unyielding in pressuring Japan to withdraw from China. Minei's statement in the Diet that if the United States insists on exerting greater pressure on Japan, the Japanese government is prepared to deal with the resulting situation, and the statement by Navy Minister Yoshida that the Japanese Navy's armaments will strive for perfection without leaving any room for compromise, and that our diplomacy must be backed by strength, are all highly approved. In the diplomatic policy towards the United States, naval strength will be the driving force, and we hope that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs trusts and fully utilizes this driving force, and that the U.S. authorities can accurately assess this strength. The English-language Japan Times stated that the embargo bill proposed in the U.S. Congress has caused constant anxiety in Japan. Japan pays serious attention to this anti-Japanese action. The United States openly supports China in its war against Japan and is recently planning to build a massive navy so that its strength can rival the total of the other two major naval powers. The U.S.'s purpose is clearly not purely for the defense of its own people, who have the responsibility to protect their homeland, which is difficult to ignore. It is generally believed that although the United States is temporarily postponing the implementation of an embargo, the expansion of the U.S. Navy program passed by Congress, although not an imminent danger, is also clear evidence of the United States' unfriendly attitude.

### Japan Reaffirms Friendship with the Philippines

Manila – The Philippine News Herald published a statement from the Japanese Foreign Ministry this afternoon, reiterating that Japanese Foreign Minister Arita stated on the 10th of this month that Japan has no ambition towards the Philippines and hopes that the Philippines will conclude a non-aggression treaty with Japan. The original text roughly stated, "Japan and the Philippine Islands are close in territory, and the friendship has always been close. Therefore, the Japanese government, in order to seek the common interests of the two countries, sincerely hopes to enhance cultural relations with the Philippine Islands and strengthen economic ties. Unfortunately, there are still many people in the Philippines who cannot understand Japan's intentions and fear that after the independence of the Philippine Islands, it will invite Japanese aggression. It is not known that this suspicion and terror are precisely sufficient to make the international atmosphere increasingly chaotic. We hope that the Philippines will eliminate this fear and have a clear understanding of Japan's policy." The tone of the entire text clearly expresses that Japan has no territorial ambitions towards the Philippines and hopes that the Philippines will achieve independence soon. (United Press, 24th)

### Saito's Disciplinary Case Will Trigger Political Turmoil in Japan; If the Government's Motion Is Rejected by the House of Representatives, the Minei Cabinet May Find It Difficult to Maintain Its Life

Tokyo – When the House of Representatives convenes next week to consider the case of Mr. Saito Takao, a veteran member of the Minseito party, for his allegedly inappropriate remarks on the so-called "Holy War" in China on February 2nd, the life of the Minei Cabinet will be in danger. According to observers, if the government's motion to expel Saito fails to gain a two-thirds majority in the House of Representatives, the government must dissolve the Diet or resign. At a time when the whole country is in an unstable state, a general election seems inappropriate. Therefore, it is generally believed that if the motion is rejected, the cabinet itself may submit its resignation soon. Currently, the parties of the right wing, the Social Masses Party, and the Nakajima (reorganized) faction of the Seiyukai support the government and the army's demand to expel Saito, while the Kugarara faction of the Seiyukai and most members of the Minseito party oppose it. However, the directors of the Minseito party also support the expulsion of Saito. The political realists and the Social Masses Party are now planning to expand this matter and accuse Machida Chuji, the head of the Minseito party, of being responsible for instructing Saito to make the speech. Furthermore, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Oyama Matsushige, should also take the blame for not reprimanding Saito and urging him to immediately retract his previous remarks. At the same time, Saito himself still insists on his uncompromising attitude, saying that he will firmly defend the life of a protector of parliamentary politics. His speech was aimed at giving the government an opportunity to clarify to the world the true purpose of its actions in China. The current difficulty lies in the fact that everything is kept secret. He is extremely concerned about the welfare of the country, and why doesn't the Prime Minister explain the overall situation so that Diet members and the general public can understand the essence of the events in China? Japan has no true politicians, and now someone wants to impose disciplinary action, which is absurd. He believes that his attitude is righteous and can face Heaven. If he has committed a major crime that requires him to resign from his position as a member of the Diet, then he is willing to commit seppuku to prove his innocence. It is believed that if Saito is expelled by a majority vote in the House of Representatives, then the electoral district he has represented for twenty-five years will immediately hold a re-election.

### British Foreign Office States That the Problem of Japanese Deposits in Silver Has Been Resolved Is Inaccurate

London – The British Foreign Office stated today that the recent London dispatch from the Allied News Agency, carried in the Far East, which stated that according to reliable sources, British Foreign Secretary Halifax stated to the Japanese Ambassador on February 20th that the British government believes that the problem of Chinese deposits in silver has been practically resolved and that General Chiang Kai-shek has agreed to a plan to transfer these silver deposits to a bank in a neutral country, is inaccurate. The aforementioned dispatch also stated that the British Foreign Secretary indicated that if Britain's war aims are not hindered, it is prepared to reduce restrictions on the export of Australian wool and other imperial products to Japan, and that other neutral countries cannot demand the same treatment. This is also completely fabricated. (Reuters, 24th)

### Japanese House of Peers Discusses the Current Situation; Member Vice-Island Speaks Against Flattering the United States

Tokyo – The Japanese House of Peers held a plenary session at 10:10 this morning and immediately began discussions. Mr. Tatebe Togo (same as above) stated that in October last year, U.S. Ambassador to Japan Grew stated that the New Order in East Asia was incomprehensible to Americans, and it was regrettable that Americans lacked understanding of such a great ideal. Currently, in a situation where the world has no choice but to build a new order, Japan deeply hopes to establish a new order in East Asia and establish world order, and to awaken China to complete independence. The Konoe statement also departs from this point. The current Japanese cabinet is probably handling the incident with this belief. Although there are many criticisms of the Konoe statement, Japan should abandon the position of small-mindedness and always stand on the viewpoint of magnanimity. The so-called guarantee of the minimum in the Konoe statement means that Japan has fulfilled its moral obligations. Regarding the following points, the specific content of the construction of the New Order in East Asia should be questioned, namely (1) My intention to construct the New Order in East Asia should first organize an East Asian social union with the integration of China, Japan, and Manchuria as a whole, and move towards achieving a great ideal; (2) If the construction of a new order ignores national psychology, then its results cannot be expected. What does the government think? Prime Minister Minei replied that the construction of the New Order in East Asia is fundamentally different from the so-called war of aggression. My intention is that if the ideal of the "Holy War" can be achieved, then even without reparations or territory, the people can be satisfied. The government has always adhered to this fundamental guideline, striving not to cause the people to have dissatisfied views, carefully developing policies, and conducting thorough reviews. Once a decision is made, it will be implemented with a consistent approach. Foreign Minister Arita also replied that Japan's diplomatic policy is based on the great spirit of "Hakko Ichiu" and that diplomatic measures and righteous diplomacy should be implemented, but it is not acceptable if it is insulted by other countries, so attention should be paid to this. The Diet adjourned at 0:10. (Allied Dispatch, 24th)

Hong Kong – Tokyo dispatch: Mr. Soejima Tadashi, an important member of the Japanese House of Peers Research Council, asked in the afternoon that 90% of the American people believe that economic pressure is better than military force to make Japan yield. Japan's policy toward the United States has proven to be extremely flawed. Purely engaging in flattery is a failure. In the future, the Foreign Minister should drastically eliminate this kind of petty "flattering" policy. (24th Dispatch)

### French-Japanese Negotiations on the Bombing of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway

Paris – Regarding the case of Japanese aircraft bombing the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, the French government has protested to Japan for many days. Correspondents from various newspapers recently inquired with a responsible authority as to whether the Japanese side has responded. According to the reply, the Japanese government's response arrived in Paris yesterday, and its content is full of a spirit of compromise, which shows that the country does indeed want to strive to resolve this case.

### Extension of U.S. Government's Special Privileges Regarding Reciprocal Trade Agreements for Three Years; Bill Proposed by Both Houses of Congress Passed by the House of Representatives; Hull's Reciprocal Policy Wins an Important Victory

Washington – The privilege currently enjoyed by the U.S. government to sign reciprocal trade agreements with various countries is set to expire on June 12th of this year. Therefore, a bill was submitted to Congress requesting that this privilege be extended for three years. It was recently approved by the House of Representatives by a majority of 216 votes to 168 and immediately transferred to the Senate for discussion. The Senate Finance Committee is scheduled to begin reviewing it within days. When it is submitted to the Senate for discussion, Secretary of State Hull will personally attend and present explanations. Political figures have recently commented on this matter, saying that reciprocal politics is being abandoned by Secretary of State Hull and has been promoted for many years, and now it has won an important victory. During the discussion in the House of Representatives, most members proposed amendments, all advocating that the establishment of reciprocal trade agreements should be supervised by Congress. Secretary of State Hull expressed opposition, and all amendments were rejected. President Roosevelt, who is currently cruising at sea, sent a telegram to Secretary of State Hull expressing congratulations after hearing that the House of Representatives had passed the bill, stating that after the bill is enacted, the peace and prosperity of international relations will definitely be beneficial.

### Soviet Military Strength Is Not What It Used to Be: Significant Performance on Both East and West Lines; All-Soviet Celebration of the Anniversary of the Founding of the Red Army

Moscow – Today is the 22nd anniversary of the Red Army and Navy, and the people of the entire Soviet Union are holding celebrations. Solemn gatherings were held in Moscow, Leningrad, Kiev, Minsk, and other places to celebrate this glorious anniversary. Soviet newspapers have all published articles describing the achievements of the Red Army.

The Pravda commented, "In the past twenty-two years, the Soviet army has now reached a certain stage, a stage that conforms to the interests and dignity of the Soviet Union and guarantees the peaceful work of the Soviet people. Our country's strength and international prestige have now greatly increased. The Red Army and Navy have become stronger along with the people of the entire country, and there have also been significant changes in terms of technology, organization, and numbers. Soviet industry provides the Red Army and Navy with countless aircraft, tanks, and submarines, but its main success is the emergence of a large number of military cadres who are not only highly experienced soldiers but also extremely loyal to the motherland and the Lenin-Stalin Party.

The 22nd anniversary of the Red Army is an important anniversary year. The Red Army's fighting power is currently being tested. The whole world now has the opportunity to be convinced of the strength of the Red Army and Navy and the excellence of its cadres. In the Khalkhin Gol area, the Soviet army annihilated the enemy that invaded the border of the Mongolian Republic. Under the orders of the Soviet government, the Red Army acted swiftly, drove out the Polish army, and liberated thirteen million compatriots in Western Ukraine and Belarus. On the northwestern border, the Soviet Army and Navy have given a severe response to the Finnish White Guards incited by British and French imperialism. The war base in Finnish territory, formed by the enemies of the Soviet Union to attack Leningrad, has been destroyed by the Red Army. The plans of the war instigators have failed again. The routes for attacking Leningrad by land and sea have been permanently blocked.

The Red Army and Navy have strengthened its northwestern border, returning freedom and happiness to the Finnish people and helping them to be liberated from the oppressors. The Red Army has shown heroic performance in its operations against the Finnish White Guards. At present, not only have the generals and soldiers been rewarded individually, but the entire Red Army has been awarded medals. The front and rear have become one, and internal unity has become even more consolidated." (TASS, 23rd)

Moscow – Soviet People's Naval Deputy Commissar Lev Zhengguo recently wrote an article in Pravda commenting on the 22nd anniversary of the Red Army and Navy. The article stated, "In the past few years, the Soviet Navy has become a great force. They have repeatedly demonstrated their heroism and decisiveness in the struggle against the war instigators. The strengthening of our naval power has been particularly significant in the past few years. The Baltic Fleet has added countless warships and submarine squadrons. The strength of the Black Sea Fleet has also been strengthened, and it now has agile war weapons such as battleships, submarines, and torpedo boats. After being initiated by Stalin, the Northern Navy was established in 1933 and has now become a strong force. Anyone who attempts to attack the Soviet Union from the north should pay attention. The Northern Sea area and the Gulf of Finland are both areas that are not easy to conquer. The Black Sea Fleet was established at the same time as the Northern Navy. In addition to small warships such as torpedo boats, the Black Sea Fleet has a total of 100 warships. As for the naval air force and border defense, they have all been strengthened in terms of quality. Soviet industry is extremely developed and can definitely manufacture all kinds of warships. In the past year alone, countless new warships have been added, and there are still many warships under construction. The warships we build are no less than those of any country." (TASS, 23rd)

### Large Turkish Army Concentrates on the Eastern Border; Turkish Statement Denies

Ankara – The Turkish government, through a semi-official communication from the Italian news agency, firmly denied the Moscow report that Turkey has stationed 500,000 troops on the Soviet-Turkish border and built aircraft hangars near the border, housing 500 new-style British, French, and American aircraft. (Reuters, 24th)

Rome – Rumors that Turkey has already mobilized were rampant here last night. According to private news from Ankara, the capital of Turkey, the rumors that Turkish troops have concentrated on the Soviet-Turkish border have been verified. (Haitong Dispatch, 24th)

New York – The New York Times recently published a dispatch from the capital of Yugoslavia stating that a "state of alert" has been declared within Turkey. Furthermore, a dispute occurred at the border between Turkey and the Soviet Union, with a battalion of the Red Army crossing the border into Turkish territory, being disarmed by the Turkish border guards, and being detained. (Havas, 24th)

Istanbul – After exploration and discussion here, it has been telegraphed that the rumor that Turkey has announced a state of emergency for mechanical transmission is completely unfounded. This rumor is probably due to the recent passage of the economic emergency laws. In fact, the purpose of these laws is only to make the national economy meet the needs of national defense and has no military significance. (Reuters, 24th)

### Heavy Snow and Dense Fog on the Front Lines Impede Soviet Activities; Vyborg Is Still in Finnish Hands; Soviet Forces Cleared from Lake Ladoga

Moscow – According to a communiqué from the headquarters of the Leningrad Military District, there were no major developments on the front lines yesterday. On the Karelian Isthmus, Soviet activities have been hampered by heavy snow and dense fog. Soviet forces continued to occupy twelve fortresses, including four solid gun emplacements. Also, due to adverse weather conditions, air force activities were limited to reconnaissance flights. (TASS, 24th)

Helsinki – Although fierce fighting continued all day yesterday on the entire Karelian front, the Soviet army failed to fulfill its promise to capture Vyborg to celebrate the 22nd anniversary of the Red Army. Check the 12th anniversary of the Red Army's promise to capture Vyborg. Vyborg is an important intersection point, which is the current target of the Soviet army's offensive. The Soviet army is currently looking for a weak point to rush to Vyborg. The Soviet tanks captured by the Finnish army before have now been repaired and are ready for use, and the Soviet flat-shooting guns captured by the Finnish army are now also used to counterattack the Soviet army that is fiercely attacking the Vyborg line. Finnish communiqués state that the Soviet army launched two attacks between Mořakanvila and Äyräpäänjärvi yesterday, and both were repulsed. The Soviet army left about a large team of corpses each time. A Soviet team crossed Lake Äyräpäänjärvi to attack Siiskimäki and has been driven back. 800 Soviet soldiers died and 100 were taken prisoner. After regaining the key location in Lake Ladoga on Wednesday, the Finnish army engaged in mopping up and seized a large number of combat equipment, including 12 cannons and more than 50 machine guns and tractors. (Reuters, 24th)

### Soviet Union Denies Bombing Sweden

Moscow – A recent telegram from a Reuters correspondent in Stockholm reported that "seven Soviet aircraft dropped ten explosive bombs and countless incendiary bombs on the town of Pajala, Sweden (five miles from the Finnish border highway)." TASS is now authorized to solemnly declare that no Soviet aircraft have ever flown over Pajala or any other part of Sweden. The Reuters report is purely a malicious fabrication. (TASS, 23rd)

Stockholm, Swedish Capital – Semi-official sources here state that the aircraft that bombed the village of Pajala within Sweden a few days ago have now been clearly identified as Soviet aircraft. (Reuters, 24th)

### The Mission Borne by British Warships in the Arctic Ocean: Attempt to Disrupt German-Soviet Freight

London – British Naval Headquarters maintained silence yesterday regarding news from Copenhagen, Denmark, that the British fleet was conducting exercises near the Soviet port of Murmansk. Well-informed sources indicate that blockading Murmansk implies combat operations against a neutral port. The British maintain ostensibly good relations with this neutral country (the Soviet Union). If the British fleet is stationed outside the port of Murmansk, watching German ships or ships of other countries sailing to Germany, then British warships are only implementing the suppression of contraband, which is the same method used by British warships elsewhere. The British fleet near Murmansk has two missions: (1) They intend to prevent goods from being transported from Murmansk to Germany; (2) They will prevent German ships from returning to Norwegian waters from the Atlantic Ocean via the Arctic Ocean. Another reason is that the British warships intend to hinder the transportation of German military supplies to the Soviet Union in Murmansk, which is consistent with Britain's policy of seizing German export goods.

### British Prime Minister Chamberlain's Speech Reiterates War Goals Against Germany, Seeking to Free Small European Nations from the Threat of Aggression; Willing to Consider If Germany Offers Concrete Guarantees

London

Prime Minister Chamberlain, in a speech delivered in Birmingham this afternoon to conclude the series of speeches by members of the wartime cabinet, lauded the Finnish army's heroic resistance in fighting the many with the few and the strong with the weak. He reiterated the Allies' war aims, stating that they do not include humiliating or oppressing Germany. If Germany is prepared to offer reliable evidence of goodwill, it will find no lack of such goodwill from other nations. Regarding the Soviet Union's actions in the war against Finland, their students have not yet learned from their German teachers in terms of brutality, and have yet to make good use of their skills, let alone match the strength of their teachers. The Prime Minister continued, "We have recently heard tragic news of the treatment of the conquered peoples of Poland and Czechoslovakia. Germany's aim today is not only to overcome but to annihilate nations that resist its aggression. The small states bordering Germany now live in a nightmare of terror. The Nazi Party disregards the interests of neutral countries, whose ships are no longer safe from German attacks. Even ships traveling between neutral ports are at risk of being sunk. Merchant ships are sunk without warning, their cargoes destroyed, and their helpless sailors left to drift at sea to drown or perish from exposure to the cold. Yet, neutral countries are not allowed to utter a complaint. But when Britain, in order to save three hundred of her fellow citizens illegally captured, from the suffering of German concentration camps, commits a merely technical violation of neutrality, without harming neutral lives or property, the Nazi Party howls as loudly as it can. However, no matter what atrocities the enemy commits, one thing is certain: however long the war may last, we have no fear of the outcome of this struggle."

After the Prime Minister praised the British troops fighting hard on the Western Front, he said that Germany was greatly disappointed by the assistance that the British Empire had given to Britain. The British Navy has performed outstandingly in this war. Since the outbreak of hostilities, ships entering and leaving British ports have totaled 50 million tons, all thanks to the protection of the Navy. In addition, the convoy system has been very successful. Approximately 9,000 British, French, and neutral ships have been escorted by warships, with only 0.2% being sunk. "I am amazed by the greatness of the efforts being made by the whole country, and by the unity and decisiveness of the spirit with which the war is being waged. I feel that today the nation's determination to resist evil forces and overcome them is unified and unprecedented in history."

The Prime Minister then mentioned German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and Propaganda Minister Goebbels, saying that the Nazi aim is to destroy Britain and dominate the world. On the other hand, the Allies are fighting to the end to resist Germany's domination of the world. "But we have no desire to destroy any people. Our present struggle is to ensure that small European nations can live safely in the future, free from the threat of aggression. However, we neither want to dominate ourselves, nor do we want to annex the territory of any other. Our struggle is to correct the wrongs that Germany has inflicted on formerly free peoples. We firmly believe that this goal can be achieved, and know that it need not subject others to any restrictions. Our struggle is for the freedom of individual conscience and religion. Our struggle is for the persecuted peoples everywhere. Our struggle is for the abolition of militarism and the accumulation of armaments, which have impoverished the whole of Europe, and not just Germany. Therefore, they must be abolished so that Europe can achieve the security it needs, and European countries can be spared bankruptcy and destruction."

The Prime Minister continued, "How, then, can the above-mentioned goals be achieved? First, the independence of Poland and Czechoslovakia must be restored. Second, we must have some satisfactory evidence that any promises and guarantees will be put into practice. Under the current German government, there is no security to be expected in the future, because those who are prepared to cooperate in rebuilding Europe have been ruthlessly exiled. Even neutral opinions are not heard within Germany. Its rulers have repeatedly stated that they do not keep their promises to foreign governments and peoples. Therefore, Germany must take the second step to show us that it has completely abandoned the theory of might makes right. Britain and France cannot and do not want to solve this new Europe alone. Others must help us, first by promoting disarmament, as this is a key feature of lasting peace. When Germany restores its credibility, it can do more than other countries, because its credibility has been largely destroyed by itself. Once Germany is prepared to provide reliable evidence of its goodwill, it will find that others are willing to help overcome the economic difficulties that will arise from the transition from war to peace."

"None of the war aims I have put forward contain any point of insulting or oppressing anyone. We intend to work and support these goals on this basis, and to seek a solution with any government that offers evidence of its sincerity. However, the second step is not for us to take. We are determined that freedom must prevail, because our decision to join the war was because brutality and intimidation sought to prevail over freedom. We will continue to fight with all our strength and military power until we are satisfied with the safety of freedom."

The Prime Minister concluded by mentioning the alliance with France, saying that in the first six months of the war, this alliance had grown into a close friendship and understanding. This can be summed up by the words of French Prime Minister Daladier at the end of the last Supreme Military Council meeting: "The thoughts and actions of the two governments have become one." As are the two governments, so are the two peoples. "I recently toured France and saw our country's magnificent army, shoulder to shoulder with the brave soldiers of allied France, defending the Western Front. I also saw in the Maginot Line the cheerful and sincere cooperation of British and French troops everywhere, and every soldier living in harmony with the people of the village where they were stationed, like family members. I am immensely proud. This inner harmony will not end when the war ends, and will be sufficient to help us address the various issues of the new Europe within a group. We are happy to welcome other countries that support our righteous cause to join this group." (Reuters, 24th)

### From the Black Sea to the Arctic Ocean, Serious War Threat; The Day Any Country Invades the Balkans Will Be the Day Turkey Joins Britain and France in the War

Rome The Italian newspapers today published various reports from across Europe about the "war threat from the Black Sea to the Arctic Ocean." Although no criticism was made, they gave the impression that war could break out at any time in the Caucasus and Northern Europe. The Italian newspaper "Il Popolo d'Italia" reprinted a statement from a newspaper in Istanbul, saying that the day any country invades the Balkan Peninsula will be the day Turkey joins the Allied forces in the war. Several newspapers also prominently featured news from Berlin about the troops commanded by General Weygand, the commander of the French forces in the Near East in Syria, and discussed the possibility of invading the Soviet oil-producing regions. Italian newspapers also carried reports from Cairo about the cooperation between Britain, France, and Egypt in the Near East, and the Swedish newspaper "Nid Tid" claimed that the visit of British Dominion Minister Eden to Egypt was significant. The opinions of "Nid Tid" were also reprinted in the Italian newspapers. "Nid Tid" believes that Germany cannot prevent mobilization within Egypt, and the hope of the Arab world to destroy Britain has now been eliminated. The Soviet Union's defeat in Finland has given the Allies a diplomatic foothold. If the Allies cut off the oil supply from Baku, the Allies will win and Germany and the Soviet Union will lose. (Reuters, 24th)

### Milk Cheaper Than Water

Stockholm, Capital of Sweden "Svenska Dagbladet" reported today that the price of semi-skimmed milk in the town of Daugavpils, Latvia, is cheaper than water. This is probably unique in the world, because the severe climate has affected the water supply, causing the price of water to skyrocket. People are now using milk as a substitute. (Haitong Telegraph, 24th)

### Welles Arrives in Gibraltar Yesterday, Visits Rome First on His European Tour

Gibraltar Welles, the U.S. State Department official who is representing President Zasford on a mission to investigate the European situation, has arrived here on the Italian mail ship "Lax." At the same time, the Italian side has completed preparations to receive Welles. It is expected that Mussolini will meet with Welles on Sunday, after which Welles will leave Rome for Berlin and then to Paris and London. It is not yet known whether Welles will visit the Pope while in Rome, but it is generally expected that Welles will visit the Pope to discuss the global situation after completing his mission. (Reuters, 24th)

Berlin The itinerary for U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles' visit to Berlin has not yet been finalized, as there is no confirmed information on when Welles will arrive here. It is believed that Welles will stay in the German capital for two days, first holding talks with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, and then meeting with Führer Hitler. During his time in Berlin, Welles and his party will stay at the Adlon Hotel. (Haitong Telegraph, 24th)

### Foreign Ministers of the Three Nordic Countries Meet, Neutral Economic Issues Will Be Discussed

Copenhagen The meeting of the foreign ministers of Sweden, Norway, and Denmark, which is being held here today, will discuss the general neutrality issues of the Scandinavian countries and various economic issues. The meeting will be chaired by Danish Foreign Minister Munch, and is expected to take two days to complete. (Reuters, 24th)

Stockholm, Capital of Sweden Swedish Foreign Minister Günther left by train last night for Copenhagen to attend the meeting of the foreign ministers of Denmark, Sweden, and Norway, which begins today. Although the meeting will directly discuss maritime issues, the three foreign ministers will undoubtedly take the opportunity to discuss many issues of immediate concern to the three countries, such as (1) the Finnish issue, and the attitude the three countries will take in the event of open intervention by other countries; (2) the security issue of the Scandinavian Peninsula, especially in the event of an invasion of any of the three countries, etc. Although the indignation of the Scandinavian countries over the difficulties of neutral navigation has increased, it is expected that this meeting will not have surprising results. The meeting is expected to end on Sunday. (Reuters, 24th)

### Romania Pursues a Good Neighbor Policy; Romania and Bulgaria May Cooperate to Resist Aggression; Italy Tries to Draw Hungary and Romania Closer

Paris Romanian Finance Minister Constantinescu has already traveled to Bulgaria for consultations. Although the official goal of this trip is to discuss various financial and economic issues, according to general knowledge in the capitals of Romania and Bulgaria, the scope of the talks is much broader. Diplomatic sources say that Bulgaria's recent rapprochement with Turkey, and talk of merging with Yugoslavia, are noteworthy, now that it is improving relations with Romania. Bulgaria is being courted by Turkey, so there is at least the possibility of temporary cooperation with the Balkan Entente countries. For this reason, despite the Dobruja Province issue standing in the way between Romania and Bulgaria (the province belonged to Bulgaria before the last European war, and now belongs to Romania), they have become closer to each other. Since Germany and the Soviet Union have colluded, the Balkan Peninsula countries have been threatened by the same crisis, and therefore feel the need for cooperation. (Havas, 23rd)

Rome "The Evening Post," the mouthpiece of the Romanian Foreign Ministry, published an article today discussing the recent visits of two Romanian politicians to foreign countries, one being the visit of Romanian youth leader Horia Sima to Rome, and the other being Finance Minister Constantinescu's visit to the Bulgarian capital. It strongly stated that Sima's warm reception by the Italian government in Rome showed how well Italy viewed the new Romania under the leadership of Carol II. As for the Romanian Finance Minister's visit to the Bulgarian capital, it showed that there would be considerable development in trade between the two countries. Between Romania and Bulgaria, or will open up ferries and navigation, Romania's policy result, will make its neighborly relations closer. (Haitong Telegraph, 24th)

Budapest According to a correspondent from the "Nemzeti Újság" in Yugoslavia, Yugoslav political figures believe that Romania has clearly changed its foreign policy and is seeking the understanding of its neighbors. The President of the National Bank of Romania, Sima, held talks in Rome and the Bulgarian capital, with the goal of promoting a good neighbor policy. It is said that Sima has returned to Rome with a concrete plan to solve the Romanian-Hungarian problem, and it is generally believed that Hungary will be able to accept this agreement. According to the "Magyar Nemzet," a statement by MP Rajniss stated: "Italy's interests will only be affected after the Allies win a great victory. If General Weygand leads the Near East troops to attack the Tatar Strait, Italy will also be forced to make a decision." (Haitong Telegraph, 24th)

Rome Romanian youth leader Horia Sima, who has returned from a visit to Italy, told reporters that Italy is very concerned about Romania and is very welcoming to Romanians. All middle schools are allowed to enroll Romanian students. Finally, Sima declared that he spoke to Italian Prime Minister Mussolini in Romanian, and Mussolini fully understood him. (Haitong Telegraph, 24th)

### German Planes Attack British Ship, Two Crash into the Sea

London It was announced here today that two German planes were damaged and crashed into the sea after attacking a British ship. The news was brought by the "Haden" (400 tons) steamer, which arrived in port today. The ship was bombed by German planes and machine-gunned. The ship was hit by a bomb, and all the crew members escaped in lifeboats. Later, seeing that the ship had not sunk, they all returned to the ship and were towed to port for repairs. (Reuters, 24th)

### Four German Submarines Reported Sunk; Neutral Countries Condemn Germany's Naval Warfare Methods

London Last night, rumors spread in London that four German submarines had been sunk, but officials had not yet received detailed reports of the matter. It is said that the British Air Force played a major role in the sinking of three of them. It is also reported that two of them were sunk in the North Sea, one was sunk near Scotland, and another was sunk near Shetland by a ship. (Reuters, 24th)

The Hague German officials told neutral visitors to Berlin today that the Berlin government was disgusted by the small neutral countries' sharp criticism of submarine warfare. If neutral newspapers continue to attack German naval warfare methods, Germany will give them a very severe reply. In particular, neutral newspapers, especially Dutch newspapers, must correct their tone. Germany cannot tolerate other countries wantonly condemning the orders of German submarine commanders, and even condemning their behavior as barbaric. Officials declined to comment on the statement by the captain of the Dutch ship "Tera" that a German submarine had sunk his ship with a torpedo without warning, saying that they would wait for the submarine captain's report before expressing an opinion. A Dutch newspaper today published an article expressing the anger of the Netherlands over the sinking of its ship by a German warship, saying that bombing without warning is an unjust act that loses the status of a naval warfare country. Italian or American ships have not suffered such losses, but only the shipping of the Netherlands and the Scandinavian countries is affected. Small neutral countries have to rely on supplies from other neutral countries overseas, but Germany not only attacks them without warning, but also specifically chooses the ships of small neutral countries to destroy. What is this if not intentional? (Reuters, 24th)

### Romanian Oil Distribution Issue: Germany and Italy Show Clear Understanding; Both Countries Send Personnel to Romanian Capital, Related to This Issue

Bucharest The Director of Economic Affairs of the German Foreign Ministry, Clodius, is scheduled to visit here again in a short period of time. At the same time, the Italian economic delegation is also scheduled to arrive here on the 26th of this month. These two events are not without connection. The major European countries are now vying to seek a large amount of oil from Romania. As far as Italy is concerned, its oil needs rely entirely on foreign supply. It is worth noting what its attitude is towards the issue of the distribution of oil in Romania. However, the positions of Germany and Italy on this issue have not been fully clarified to date. According to some sources, an understanding has been reached among the countries on the joint distribution of Romanian oil. However, some people say that the two sides are actually in a competitive position when purchasing Romanian food and various raw materials (including oil). However, from a political point of view, it is clear that Germany and Italy still maintain a complete understanding in the corner of Southeast Europe. It can be asserted that Italy has decided to do everything possible to prevent Southeast Europe from being drawn into the vortex of the European war. (Havas, 24th)

Amsterdam A report from the Berlin correspondent of the local "Handelsblad" stated that German Economics Minister Dr. Clodius had recently left for Romania to handle the issue of Germany's oil supply. This is a clear indication of Berlin's anxiety about the oil supply. It is reported that Dr. Clodius will strongly urge the Romanian government not to impose a tax of 25% on oil transported to Germany. The "New York Times" recently published an article on the Romanian oil supply to Germany, stating that Romania's ban on gasoline exports to Germany is very beneficial to Britain and France. Even if Germany has a large amount of oil reserves, the source will not continue, and it will never dare to conduct unlimited aerial bombardment warfare, or large-scale land offensives on the Western Front. The Soviet Union can supply Germany, but transportation is difficult, and the winter weather also makes it impossible to supplement it. Germany had no choice but to send a commercial mission to Romanian Capital, with the undisguised coercion of armed invasion. However, the Allies have their own ways to dispel Romania's panic, and Turkey has ordered Romania not to worry about German anger. In the event of trouble, the strong Turkish army will help it. (Reuters, 24th)

### Japanese Domestic Situation Increasingly Serious; Prices Continue to Rise, People Complain

New York The New York Times recently commented on the situation in the Far East, saying, "The Japanese people have always been optimistic and resigned to fate, and have been able to silently endure the difficulties they encounter, but at this moment they are complaining, and all parties are openly expressing dissatisfaction. Take the resignation of the Abe Cabinet as an example. Although it was the result of the United States' abolition of commercial treaties, it was also because the Japanese government failed to meet internal difficulties as it should. For example, Japanese prices have increased by 16% in the past six months. The government previously announced last autumn that prices would not continue to rise, but in a short period of time, prices of all goods have risen sharply, especially rice prices. At one point, various items became increasingly scarce, and rice was indeed scarce. Although wages in various industries have increased from time to time, they are not widespread. The government's response to this issue has been clearly slow and ineffective. The root cause of the Abe Cabinet's resignation is here. At present, all aspects of Japan are complaining about the government. This situation, which occurs in a country where no one has ever dared to criticize the military's policies, shows how tense the political situation is. In short, the China Incident is a 'bottomless pit.' Japan is now pouring its manpower and hard-earned resources into this pit, and it is not known when it will end." (Havas, 23rd)

Hong Kong American coal industry reporter Marshall, who was seriously injured on the US "Panay" when it was bombed, returned to the United States for treatment, and then went to India via Japan. He arrived in Hong Kong on the 23rd. He said that the Japanese economy was extremely panicked, with sugar and salt out of stock, and coal and gasoline in short supply. The sale of new clothes was prohibited, and people all wore old clothes. The Japanese yen depreciated against the British pound, which could be exchanged for 32 yen. The poverty in Japan was almost unimaginable. If I had not seen it with my own eyes, I would not have believed it. (23rd dispatch)

New York Sir Victor Sassoon, a major landlord and financier in Shanghai, declared today that the Japanese people are already tired of their warlords' attempt to conquer China, and will soon rise up against their warlords. Japan's internal economy is increasingly collapsing, so the date when Japan seeks peace and maintains its face is now approaching. He also said that Japan will sooner or later realize that Japan's real enemy is not China but the Soviet Union, and at the same time, facts will prove that Britain's greatest enemy is the Soviet Union, not Germany. At present, Japanese businessmen are afraid that the United States will adopt a tougher policy towards Japan than at present. The fact that Japanese warlords have the sole power to make all major decisions in Manchuria, and that all the benefits go to senior military officers, has caused extreme dissatisfaction in Japan. The Japanese troops in South China, Central China, and along the Yangtze River have all realized that Japan has no chance of winning in China, so they all hope to return home as soon as possible. Sassoon finally declared that Japan's fate is actually in the hands of the United States, because all the important raw materials that Japan needs are in the hands of every country. (United Press, 24th)

### Young May Leave Japan Voluntarily

Tokyo It has been over a month since Young, the Tokyo correspondent of the American International News Service, was arrested by the Japanese police authorities. "News of the News" recently reported that Young may not appear in court and will leave Japan voluntarily. If so, the efforts of the American Embassy can be said to have been successful, and the Japanese police authorities' willingness to assist the government in promoting relations between the United States and Japan can be clearly demonstrated here. (Havas, 23rd)

### Three German Students Visit the Far East at the Invitation of the Japanese

Berlin After the Japanese Ambassador to Germany, Kurusu, issued an invitation at the German-Japanese Student Association in Cologne yesterday, three German students will set off for Japan to visit within days. In addition to visiting Japanese universities at the invitation of the German-Japanese Cultural Association in Tokyo, they will also visit China "Manchukuo." The entire journey will take a total of six months. (Haitong Telegraph, 24th)

### Two Veteran German Military Figures Die: Gronro and Kleh

### Tai'an Cuiying Middle School Students Arrested

Over a hundred people suffered cruel torture. Relatives cried and fainted in grief.

According to a Qingdao dispatch from the English-language "North China Daily News," Tai'an Cuiying Middle School, located at the foot of Mount Tai, was founded by the American Methodist Church and sponsored by Reverend Han Pirui, an American missionary. It has been in operation for over thirty years and is one of the most outstanding educational institutions in Shandong Province, divided into four departments: high school, junior high school, normal school, and elementary school. Before the war, it had over a thousand students. When the Japanese army captured Tai'an at 10 a.m. on New Year's Day in 1939, the school had already suspended classes and been converted into a refugee camp, housing over a thousand women and children. After half a year, the school reopened, with Reverend Han continuing as principal. In late December, the Japanese military police intercepted a letter addressed to a student at Cuiying Middle School at the post office and sent people to the school to inquire. Reverend Han replied that the Japanese also had a copy of the student roster and that there was no student with that name on it, so the matter was dropped. Later, it was learned that the letter was not addressed to a student but to a worker. Upon hearing the news, the worker immediately returned to his hometown. Subsequently, the Japanese military police discovered that a student named Shi had close contact with the missing worker and lured Shi out and arrested him on December 30. On the same day, the Japanese military police intercepted another letter at the post office, addressed from someone in Jinan to a friend surnamed Zhou who was studying at Cuiying Middle School, containing jokes such as "You are Roosevelt, and I am Napoleon; let's exchange information." The Japanese military police suspected that this was a code and telegraphed the Japanese military police in Jinan to arrest the sender. They also arrested the recipient, Zhou, and five of his companions at Cuiying Middle School. On the morning of the 31st, the Japanese military police found many documents related to the Eighth Route Army in the tiles of the flower room at Cuiying Middle School. Therefore, the Japanese began their large-scale arrests. At that time, the school was already on vacation, and students were returning home. The Japanese gathered at the station and around the school, arresting hundreds of young students. After a few days, many were released, but over a hundred were subjected to severe interrogation and torture, some dying from the abuse. After the large-scale arrests, the Japanese used various means of terror. They went to Baili to arrest two students but failed to find them, so they arrested the two students' mothers. Another student who heard the news and escaped had his father arrested and forced to kneel in the open air for days before being released. The detained students were beaten every few days. Their parents and relatives cried bitterly outside the military police station, and many fainted when they heard the screams of their children being tortured. Reverend Han went to visit them but was not allowed to talk to the students; he could only look at them from a distance. Seventeen or fifteen students are still being detained.

### Grain Riot in Wuxi

Thousands of poor people cause great disorder.

Wuxi correspondence: Grain prices in Wuxi are high, and it is difficult for the common people to obtain food. Grain riots have been occurring for days and are gradually expanding. All rice shops in the county have closed. The rice shops that have suffered losses due to looting include Yongsheng of Naiman Wharf, seventeen or eighteen *shi*; Baolong of Huangnibu, unknown *shi*; Tientaixiang, three *shi*; Zhang Yuchang rice, unknown *shi*, seven *shi* of wheat, over ten *shi* of *xi*; Lanji, five *shi*, six *shi* of wheat; Yongyuanyue coarse rice, over ten *shi*; Baiyuan, eight *shi*, seven *shi* of wheat; Chen Hengyi, seventeen *shi* of white rice, eleven *shi* of coarse rice; Baiyuan, one *shi*; Zhu Changkang, over ten *shi*; Kaimenpeng, Ding Hengfeng, one hundred twenty to thirty *shi* of coarse rice; Dingcheng, one hundred eighty *shi* of coarse rice; Yang Hengtai of Xizhi Street, over ten *shi* of white rice; and Yongshang Rice Mill of Dingfengli outside the North Gate, which were all looted one after another. The reason for the rice looting is that the rice mill guilds universally withdrew 20% of the rice stored in each guild to be sold at a fixed price of 25 yuan per *shi*, limited to one *sheng* to one *dou*. After the start of this scheme the day before yesterday, the rice-stealing people were crammed and squeezed in the shops, and there was great disorder. Rice shops suddenly stopped selling, and the masses were greatly angered. The rice looting first occurred in the South Gate. By the 20th, all shops had stopped trading, leading to a large-scale rice looting spree. At that time, thousands of women and children in the North, South, and West gates held rice baskets, sieves, and cloth bags, opening the doors of rice shops and rushing in to loot rice. Those with empty hands even used their clothes and trousers to carry rice. Although the Japanese army and puppet police were notified to suppress the riot, they were helpless due to the large number of people and the situation. It is evident that the food situation in the occupied areas has reached a critical point.

### Wuxi Guerrillas Night Attack on Dangkou Town

Japanese Platoon Leader Wounded by Bullet

Wuxi Correspondence: Dangkou Town in the county is a key point for waterways and also stores a large amount of salt. The Japanese have stationed a platoon of soldiers there, as well as a puppet police sub-station and a local self-defense corps. At about 7:00 PM on the 20th of this month, over a hundred guerrillas suddenly arrived, all armed with guns. They first surrounded the puppet police station, the self-defense corps, and the township office, arresting six puppet police officers, unknown members of the self-defense corps, and nine including Shi Tingzhang, an assistant staff member of the puppet township office. They then engaged in battle with the Japanese troops stationed at the salt fields. The guerrillas were exceptionally brave. The Japanese platoon leader, Watada, was shot in the face, and the puppet captain, Liu Jihua, was also injured. Several puppet corps members were killed. The battle line extended to four or five *li* near Ganlu Town and stopped at about 1:00 AM. The Japanese and puppets have been greatly alarmed after the attack on Dangkou Town.

### Overseas Chinese Education in Siam Suffers Devastation Authorities Do Not Allow Chinese Schools to Reopen and Do Not Allow Overseas Chinese to Establish New Schools

(Hong Kong Dispatch) According to a visitor from Siam, regarding the Chinese schools in Bangkok and inland, after most of them had their licenses revoked by the Ministry of Education last year, they were closed down and could not hold classes. As a result, students had no way to pursue their studies, and most of them were out of school. Only a small number of those who could afford to return to China to study were able to do so. After the authorities of the above-mentioned Chinese schools, whose licenses were revoked by the Ministry of Education, had their licenses revoked, some of them, hoping to reopen their schools, submitted petitions to the Ministry of Education and the Prime Minister, Luan Pibun, requesting permission to reopen their schools. In addition, there were also several schools that requested to be re-established. Regarding the Chinese schools that requested to be reopened and those that requested to be re-registered, it is reported that the government authorities, after careful review, all believed that the above-mentioned schools had violated the Private School Regulations and were therefore revoked their licenses. Now, for the convenience of management and local security, it has been decided not to approve the requests for reopening or re-registering the schools. As for the problem of students being out of school, it is said that the government believes that most of these students are of compulsory education age and that there are already public schools or self-governing schools where they can study.

### Grain Large Quantities of Foreign Rice Continuously Arriving in Shanghai Hope for Restoration of Lower Rice Prices if There is No Speculation or Hoarding

The downward trend in the rice market has not yet stopped. Because the market has changed drastically, people's morale is exhausted and difficult to recover. At the opening this morning, Xiaojiao and No. 2 Siam both sold for only 43 yuan, a decrease of about one yuan compared to the previous day's market. As a result, the general recycled goods market was even more panicked and continued to fall. No. 1 Saigon opened at only 46.5 yuan, No. 2 Saigon at 44.5 yuan, Huojiao at 45.5 yuan, down to 44.5 yuan, Tokyo broken rice at 42 yuan, mixed broken at 34 yuan, and Xiaojiao at 42.7 yuan, which was a drop of about 2.5 yuan compared to the original cargo. However, after this drop, the market showed a hesitant trend, and the retail and wholesale markets gradually became active. By noon, the situation became tighter, and the prices rebounded by half a yuan. No. 1 was effectively closed at 47 yuan, No. 2 Saigon at 45.5 yuan, 45 yuan, Huowen at 46 yuan, mixed broken at 35 yuan, 34.5 yuan, and Tokyo broken tip at 43 yuan, 42 yuan even. Xiaojiao was at 41.5 yuan. As for glutinous rice, the price also rose by a small amount, with Jintan white selling for 43 yuan and Danyang for 41 yuan. It is said that no less than five to six thousand bags of thick and thin *jing* rice were transferred out of the Hongkou district yesterday, and the price in the black market also fell step by step. Kunshan high *jing* was selling for 50 yuan, and the medium cargo was only 47-48 yuan, early and late rice for 46 yuan, etc. Compared to the highest peak the week before, the price had dropped by about 10 yuan. If it can continue to fall, it will be a blessing for the people's food supply.

The foreign rice market was even weaker yesterday, because shipments were continuously arriving in port. The total amount of cargo scheduled to arrive in February and early March is as high as 400,000 to 500,000 bags, which will arrive in Shanghai one after another. The local market in the producing area has also shown a downward trend due to the sharp fall in the Shanghai market due to the disappearance of new shipments. Therefore, most floating retail investors are nervous and seek to sell off. The opening price in the morning showed a degree of decline, with both Saigon Xiaojiao and Siam falling by more than a yuan. Recycled Xiaojiao fell to as low as 53 yuan, and No. 2 Siam fell to 53.2, a decrease of 5-6 jiao. However, the raw market price insisted, and the selling intention turned to insistence, and the price rebounded by 3-5 jiao. No. 2 West was also at 54 yuan to 54.2 jiao, and No. 1 at 56 yuan and 57.5 yuan. Foreign telegrams were mixed, but still higher than the recycled price.

Foreign Rice Continues to Arrive Taikoo Responds and Ships 14,560 Bags From Hong Kong. They imported 14,560 bags from Hong Kong on the evening of the 23rd and docked at the company's wharf on the Bund in the French Concession. Unloading began yesterday morning. Java Company sent five ships to Vietnam to ship rice to Shanghai. The first ship, Laoshen Bisha, is scheduled to arrive today, as reported previously. According to the company yesterday, the ship was slightly delayed en route and will be postponed. The ship is now expected to arrive in Shanghai by the end of this month (29th). (Zu)

### Flour and Wheat No Change

Flour Because rice prices are falling, people's morale is inevitably weak. In addition to the manufacturers limiting the supply of flour to 7,500 bags per day, there is no surplus supply. Therefore, the market is extremely quiet. Old Che brand stack bills still stand at a price of 14.6 jiao, and the transfer stack goods are slightly lower. Green Che still requires 15.5 jiao, but there is a lack of formal transactions.

Wheat After the sharp decline some time ago, Japanese factories and customer clothing companies have taken in a lot of the supply. The cargo side believes that the current price of foreign wheat is expensive and that there is very little domestic wheat in stock, so yesterday it was unwilling to loosen up any further. It is rumored that Suzhou wheat is planning to open at a price of 26 yuan, but buyers are still thinking of suppressing the price a little, so both sides are holding their ground.

### Miscellaneous Grains Yellow Beans Fall by Three Yuan

The situation of yellow beans is that, due to the decline in oil prices and various environmental constraints, people's morale has softened and the price has gradually fallen. As a result, the market price has fallen by three yuan compared to the highest peak. Yesterday afternoon, the Hong Kong gang suddenly came to inquire, and the market atmosphere became slightly tighter. It is estimated that the Hong Kong gang transacted more than 2,500 bags of Qingdao beans at a price of 30 yuan, over 1,600 bags of Jinjia beans at a price of 27.1 jiao, and over 100 bags of Chongming Sand Yellow at a price of 26.8 jiao. This company handled one car of Nanjing beans at a price of 23.5 jiao, and one car of Wuhu beans at a price of 23.7 jiao.

Yesterday, 380 pieces of bean oil and 830 pieces of bean cake arrived from Yantai, 1,800 cans of crude oil arrived from Qingdao, and 591 cans of tung oil arrived from Tianjin. Today, 1,950 cans of crude oil are being transported to Hong Kong, and 70 pieces of tung oil are being transported to Italy.

### Seafood - Western Shark Fin Inventory Low, Price Doubles

Since the outbreak of the European war, the supply of Western shark fins has gradually decreased, resulting in a daily increase in the export of Eastern goods. However, some in the trade here are unwilling to purchase and sell them. Nevertheless, merchants value profit, and transactions are inevitable. The inventory of Western shark fins is at its lowest, and domestic products have completely disappeared. Eastern goods are relatively abundant. Currently, market prices have increased by more than double compared to last autumn.

### Finance - Financial Sector Refuses to Accept Gold as Collateral, Huang Jing Suddenly Feels Unsupported, Bullish Activity Greatly Reduced

Yesterday's cash spot market situation, although foreign exchange was slightly tight, gold prices fell again. This was mainly because after the financial sector refused to accept gold as collateral, the power of general bullish activities was reduced. Moreover, Tianjin banks sold off quite a bit that day, and retail bulls also closed positions due to the weekend, making it difficult to balance supply and demand. However, the opening was still firm, at 4,810 yuan. Subsequently, a certain bank and money exchange house sold off, but fortunately, Hong Kong banks had some buying interest, so the initial situation was relatively stable, hovering between 4,810 and 4,800 yuan. At around 10 o'clock, the foreign exchange market went from tight to loose, and retail investors rushed to sell, further exacerbated by the dumping from Tianjin banks. Hong Kong banks no longer showed any interest, leading to a market collapse, once plunging to a low of 4,780 yuan. By noon, sellers gradually decreased, and the situation stabilized slightly, with the closing price at 4,784 yuan, resulting in a drop of 19 yuan compared to the previous day. In the afternoon, the off-market undercurrent was calm, with the final price at 4,785 yuan. The volume of transactions in half a day was estimated at 1,500 taels. Gold ornaments remained unchanged, and customs gold remained stable.

Spot Gold Drops 19 Yuan

Since the morning, for each bar (ten taels), the opening foreign exchange was tight, and market sentiment was good. The opening price rose by 7 yuan. A money exchange house entered 20 taels, at 4,810 yuan. Shortly after, a certain bank forcefully sold off, and the money exchange house also sold on behalf of retail investors, pushing the price down by 10 yuan. The money exchange house sold 30 taels, at 4,800 yuan. Later, because a certain jewelry store still had buying interest, the price was pulled back up by 10 yuan. The money exchange house traded 50 taels back and forth, at a called price of 4,810 yuan. At that time, the exchange market suddenly reported a loosening, and the selling wind was strong. Gold shops and securities firms sold on behalf of customers, and jewelry stores and retail investors also sold, breaking through the 4,800 yuan mark. The gold shop sold 20 taels through the money exchange house, falling to 4,787 yuan. Afterwards, the foreign exchange market reported a weakening again, and the selling wind subsided slightly. A certain money exchange house bought in dozens of taels, recovering 4 yuan. However, because the securities firm came to sell again, coupled with continued selling by retail investors, there was no power to rise, and the price was suppressed again by a small amount. The jewelry store traded 20 taels back and forth, at a low of 4,780 yuan. The situation stabilized slightly at noon, rising back by 4 yuan. The jewelry store bought 30 taels from a certain bank, at 4,784 yuan as the noon closing price, resulting in a drop of 19 yuan compared to the previous day, with a fluctuation of 30 yuan in half a day. The selling price of the cash shop's own-brand gold was several yuan higher than the spot price, and the buying price was 20 yuan lower. The current standard gold was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there were few transactions.

Ornament Gold Remains at Original Price

The selling price of jewelry gold per tael has remained unchanged. Da Tong Heng still listed it at 485 yuan. The new shops had the same price as above, with a decrease of about 15 yuan for purchases.

### Sassoon Sells Huge Amount of British Exchange

Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: HSBC's listed prices showed no changes. Only the spot market for British and American exchange traded for half a day, and the undercurrent remained mediocre. Tightness and looseness were seen intermittently, but ultimately the American slightly tightened, while British exchange remained unchanged due to Sassoon's forceful selling. The opening prices were both flat, remaining at 4 shillings 1 5/6 and 6.875 yuan respectively. Subsequently, because Chinese merchants slightly bought three-month forward American exchange, and foreign banks' willingness to supply was not strong, the American exchange slightly weakened at that time, shrinking to 6.84375 yuan. However, the central bank remained stable. Then, Sassoon suddenly sold off a considerable amount of British pounds. Although HSBC had some buying interest, the position still felt abundant. British exchange once hardened to a called price of 4 shillings 1 7/1875, and American exchange also recovered to 6.875 yuan. However, the Japanese bank suddenly came to buy, and at that time, speculators still had buying interest in the three-month forward, so the market situation re-formed to be soft. Afterwards, both buyers and sellers hesitated to move forward, and the transaction suddenly became quiet, and the market closed in a flat state. British exchange remained at a called price of 4 shillings 1 5/625, and American exchange was at 6.84375 yuan, resulting in British being flat and American tightening 0.03125 compared to the previous day. The trend of futures was no different from the spot market.

Chinese Merchants Buy Three-Month American Exchange

In the early morning, the London large bars reported a shrinkage of 0.0625 for both near-term and far-term. New York silver prices were flat, and London raw gold was stable. The exchange rates of British against American, Shanghai, and France were all flat. American against British and against France were also flat, and against Shanghai was slightly down by 0.05. The central bank's listed prices for various exchanges remained the same. The opening selling prices of spot goods for British exchange were 4 shillings 0.5625, and American exchange was 6.875, with no changes compared to the previous close. After the opening, Chinese merchants first came to settle and buy three-month forward American exchange from foreign banks at 6.78125 yuan. Shortly after, foreign banks had no willingness to supply at the above price and firmly insisted on 6.75 yuan, causing the spot American exchange to also be brought down to 6.84375 yuan. However, British exchange still stood at 4 shillings 1.5625. HSBC's listed prices were announced to be unchanged, and the silver balance tax was also announced without any increase or decrease. Afterwards, the Western merchant Sassoon suddenly dumped a huge amount of British pounds, first selling spot American exchange to HSBC at 4 shillings 1.5, and then selling spot British exchange to Union Trading and other foreign banks at 4 shillings 1.71875. At the same time, Chinese merchants were buying near-term and selling far-term. At this time, spot American exchange also returned to 6.875 yuan. Then, the Japanese bank Zhengjin suddenly came to buy, so the market situation softened again. It was estimated that spot American exchange was settled with foreign banks at 6.875 and 6.84375. At that time, a merchant also bought the three-month American option from a certain bank at 6.75 yuan. After 10:30, the buying and selling suddenly turned scarce, and the situation became stable. Until the afternoon, there were no changes. British exchange remained at 4 shillings 1.5625, and American exchange also remained at 6.84375. Next month's American gold was 4 shillings 1.09375, and American exchange was 6.75, resulting in British being flat and American tightening by 0.03125 compared to the previous day. In the afternoon, there was no market on Saturday.

Hong Kong: British Flat, American Slightly Tight

Hong Kong, 24th: The opening of the Yunnan market this morning was reported as flat. British and Japanese exchange rates were unchanged. The spot American exchange gathered 0.0625, at 24.5 yuan. The spot Shanghai exchange rate dropped by 2 yuan, to 355 yuan. At 11:30, it was flat, and all exchanges had no changes. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday.

The United Banknote underground market continued to rise by 1.25 yuan, to 109.5 yuan.

### British and American Gold Tickets Still Tight

Yesterday, British and American gold pounds were supplied for profit-taking, and market prices were slightly weaker. The potential for British and American gold tickets was firm and outstanding. In the morning, British gold tickets rose slightly, to 54.1 yuan. American gold tickets remained at 14.44 yuan. In the afternoon, only American gold tickets rose slightly, to 14.45 yuan. The supply of Hong Kong tickets and French franc tickets was smooth, and market prices were slightly firm. The night market price for Japanese gold tickets remained at 1.29 yuan.

All other currencies were not changed.

### Securities - Domestic Bonds and Foreign Stocks Both Weak

The securities underground market showed no improvement yesterday. Since the drop on the 22nd, it has shown signs of sluggishness. The fundamental reason at present is that public bonds are not accepted as collateral, and renewals are not allowed even after the previous collateral expires. Therefore, due to this relationship, spot goods are flowing out steadily, and the market feels that there are too many chips. As for whether the secret of the Anglo-Japanese agreement is true or not, it is still unknown. However, the multi-party has an unfavorable impression, so the bond market is difficult to revive for a time, and at least it will enter a meandering path. Yesterday morning, Songmao slightly covered short positions, and Xinfu slightly increased its position. No. 11 and No. 64 slightly bought in. Xie Da, Taifeng, Renchang and others sold successively. Market prices went from stagnant to firm. In the afternoon, Tongshun, Lemao and No. 42 slightly offered. Jiufeng and retail investors slightly covered short positions. There were very few transactions. The market price was stable, and the result showed a slight recovery of about 0.1-0.2 yuan. The total number of transactions was estimated to be around 500,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below.

Stock Transactions: 50 shares of Rongjiao Zhongyi Trust Company were traded, at a price of 10 yuan, up 0.4 yuan.

Yesterday, the stock market of the Public Industry Association opened softly due to the erratic trend the previous afternoon. However, it quickly received support from buyers. International Trust, Jardine Matheson and Union Dock quickly rebounded. Soon, many people were closing accounts for the weekend, which slightly caused waves, but its impact on prices was minimal. At the close, various popular stocks had good demand. Rubber stocks were slightly ignored because raw rubber prices were falling. Langel Zhi and Diban Er were the exceptions.

London, 23rd: The listed prices of China's foreign debts today were still stable. The upper and lower tier bonds had no changes. London, 23rd: Today's listed prices of Far East companies' stocks of British merchants showed that only HSBC Bank's British-registered shares rose by 1 pound, at a price of 88 pounds. The rest were flat.

### Two Dock Shares - Liquidation Distributes Shares

The liquidation distribution of the British-owned Yeeson Shipyard Co., Ltd. The first asset distribution was 11 shares of Union Dock Co., Ltd. for each share, which was distributed on February 16. Now, the second cash distribution is scheduled to be distributed on March 11, with 11 yuan of national currency per share.

In addition, the liquidation distribution of the British-owned Ruiyong Shipyard Co., Ltd. The first capital distribution was one share of Union Dock Co., Ltd. for each share, which was also distributed on February 20.

### Yarn and Cloth - Focus on March Yarn, Market Price Therefore Very Stable

The yarn market is steady, and the trend is lively. Demand is still normal. In Hong Kong, the procurement of fine yarn lines is gradually picking up. Local merchants are also showing signs of action. They have already started to absorb the goods for the next month, buying 60-70 packages of March 20-count Mu Yang, at a price of 836.5-840 yuan. Most of the industry's thoughts are concentrated on March yarn. The transaction of Double Horse yarn is still booming. The highest price reached 885 yuan, and the lowest price was 880 yuan. The trend is very stable.

The spot yarn market opened this morning, and market sentiment was moderate, because there were no major changes in foreign exchange and gold. The opening price of 20-count Double Horse was 863 yuan, slightly rising to 866 yuan. After speculators sold off, it fell by 3-4 yuan. Until the close, it rose back to 864 yuan. It was found that the transaction statistics in half a day were 1,655 packages. The price of 20-count Double Horse rose by 4 yuan. Yesterday, 200 pieces of yarn were shipped to Ningbo. Today, 186 pieces of yarn and 220 pieces of cloth are being shipped to Hong Kong. The amount purchased by each gang is listed on the left.

Colleagues 1,500 Hong Kong 125

Mainland 30 Statistics 1,655

### Colleagues Entering and Exiting Lively, Cotton Outlook Still Good

The cotton transaction is still not weak, but the factory's demand has decreased again, and it is also the weekend. Japanese factories have a shortage of transactions, but the buying and selling of colleagues is still excited, and most people are optimistic, so the selling price is still as firm as usual. There is no source in northern Jiangsu. The amount purchased by each gang is listed on the left.

Foreign Cotton Market Price: The New York cotton market opened quite firmly in the morning. First, the cotton price rose by 2-3 pounds due to the purchase of speculators. Then, due to the purchase of colleagues and the covering of a part of the short positions, the closing price rose by 5-6 pounds compared to the previous day. The Indian market situation was quite firm. Yesterday, the forecast rose by 3 rupees again. The Egyptian cotton market was stable. Liverpool rose by 2 pence.

Shanghai Foreign Cotton Transaction: People's hearts are quite firm. Colleagues have a slight buying interest, but it is not strong. The factory's buying intention is always weak, and they only buy a small amount of spot goods in the market when they are in urgent need. However, colleagues' opinions continue to look high on the listed prices. The factory price converted at the exchange rate of 6.875 yuan for American exchange yesterday is as follows.

### Silk and Tea - Secondary Tussah Silk

French Firms Have Transactions

Yesterday, the American and Japanese silk markets fell. New York Japanese silk fell by 0.05-0.08 yuan. Chinese silk regular goods were down 0.1 yuan. Standard silk near-term fell 0.095 yuan, far-term was down 0.06 yuan, Hengze spot was down 60 yuan, near-term was down 74 yuan, and far-term fell 46 yuan. In the local silk market, Bai Chang Silk was inactive. For Tussah silk, only secondary brands such as Da Chang and other firms entered 70 loads yesterday, which was said to be from French firms, at a price of 250 yuan, 50 yuan lower than the market at the beginning of the month. On the 25th, 130 pieces of silk and 180 pieces of Huzhou silk were shipped to Italy. Also, on the 24th, 4,960 pieces of tea leaves came from Ningbo. On the 25th, 28 pieces of tea leaves were shipped to Hong Kong, and another 200 tons came from Taiwan to be transshipped to the United States.

### Sugar Market - Coarse White Continues to Loosen

Yesterday, foreign sugar prices were softened because the production price was seen softening, the exchange rate gradually approached, and the trend continued downstream. The association's list price for spot goods was 24 coarse Ben Zhan 60.8 yuan, small 0.9 yuan, new foreign warehouse arrivals 60.56 yuan, small 0.45 yuan, old goods still 60 yuan, transit goods 47 yuan, small 1 yuan, Taikoo brand white was stable West Zhan B mark 63 yuan, East Zhan 62.7 yuan, DY mark West Zhan 60.7 yuan, HHX mark 60.5 yuan, East Zhan 60.4 yuan, the domestic sugar market was firm, and there was no intention to sell urgently. Only more than 100 packages of Da Gong Fen were traded yesterday, at a price of 98.5 yuan. 2,360 packages of sugar came from Hong Kong.

### Hardware - Domestic Nails and Steel Bars Both Fall Slightly

The original nails of the local factory suddenly showed a loose state yesterday. This is because the output of several nail manufacturers in Shanghai is very abundant, resulting in abundant market goods. The giant customer gang and the local street sides both have no strong buying interest, causing the market situation to fall into a dull state, and people's hearts are also softening. The opening price dropped by 1-2 yuan. It is said that the current market price is 51 yuan per barrel. The market for bamboo steel bars has been soaring for a long time. However, since yesterday, the foreign exchange has eased slightly, and people's hearts have stabilized. In addition, the local construction gang and Tianjin cigarette customers have not made many purchases. It was found that only 50-60 tons were traded in the whole city, and most of them were retail sales. The wholesale transactions in the store are no longer what they used to be, causing the thoughts of colleagues to weaken, and the standard market also rebounded. For example, 3/8-4/8 inch is sold at 1,050 yuan per ton, and 5/8-1 inch is sold at about 1,000 yuan.

### Coal - Hongji Coal Slurry, 4,700 Tons Loaded

Hongji white coal slurry was originally caused by the skyrocketing water feet at the beginning of the month, which caused the coal balls to rise again and again, and there was no end to the rise. The general public was also anxious to prevent famine and bought and stored them in succession. However, the Mannin Maller Wheel shipped 4,700 tons of Hongji coal slurry from French territory yesterday. It was parked at the dock and sold by Yitai Hing Nanyang manager. The price varied, with the highest being 130 yuan per ton and the lowest being 100 yuan. In addition to being used by coal ball factories, colleagues generally did not sell large quantities.

### North-South Goods - High-Grade Longan Rises

Recently, the supply of high-grade longan has been tight due to limited arrivals. Large pieces are sold at 190 yuan, followed by 160 yuan, and ordinary ones are between 120 yuan and 110 yuan.

### French Concession Controls Prices - Responsible Committee Members Appointed, Municipal Council Price Limit Regulations to be Published, Police Department Pays Attention to Speculative Merchants

The Shanghai Municipal Council will also organize a committee within two or three days, following the French Concession authorities, to study prices and determine price targets in order to curb the sharp rise in prices. According to Director General Felippo, the Municipal Council will also follow the French Concession to implement measures to curb prices. The method of implementation is under study, and it will be implemented as soon as the results are discussed. The French Concession Price Control Committee members were appointed yesterday, and the details are recorded separately as follows.

Director General Expresses Definite Measures

The Continental Times reported that yesterday (23rd) it was heard from well-informed sources that the Shanghai Municipal Council would implement similar price-limiting regulations to those adopted by the French Concession Public Works Bureau in the next few days. Director General Felippo, although not formally confirming this statement yesterday, said that regarding the situation in the Shanghai Municipal Council, a statement will be issued within "two or three days." Until yesterday morning, the Municipal Council had heard of the French Concession's method of limiting prices, and he did not intend to make a statement now.

Close Attention to Speculation Truth

It is heard that the responsible committee of the Municipal Council has studied the methods taken by the French Concession in order to implement this method in the Shanghai Municipal Council. The Municipal Council has instructed the Police Department to pay close attention to speculators and profiteers in the city's commodity market, but unless the Municipal Council takes the same action as the French Concession authorities, speculators will not be prosecuted.

French Concession Appoints Committee Members

At the same time, it was heard last night that the French Concession authorities had appointed committee members, organized a committee, and given them great power to implement price limit measures. According to the English-language Da Mei Evening News, French Consul General Ou Ren recently announced to reporters the names of the members of the newly established French Concession Price Control Committee as follows: Chairman Ou Ren (P.Auge), members Xifu Leitun (L.Cheveretton), Tao En (J.Donne), Lai Fang (HLaffond), Dubei (P,Dupny), Aigeer (Ed.Egle), Xu Qi (Tsi Tche), Saduke (A·Sadoc), Mrs. A. Slobodtshkoff, Favret (J.Favret), Jiesipai (A.Jaspar), Bulaidian (J.Brediam), Pairuite (Y·Palud), Jordan (P·Jordan), Zhuobeici (R.Jobez), Moret (M.Moret), and four Chinese members who have not been appointed.

Business Leaders Cooperate Closely

The French Concession authorities did not forget one thing when selecting committee members, that is, they will become representatives of the residents of the French Concession. When drafting the details of the implementation of the new method, they will act prudently. He and his assistants have been closely consulting with business leaders in the city. On this point, the committee will not cause undue difficulties for the city's merchants, because the new method is to curb speculative buying and selling, not to hinder legitimate business.

Price Limit Order Has Been Implemented

Also, the Zilin Daily reported that it was heard from reliable sources last night that French Consul General Bao Daizhi would appoint members of the Price Limit Committee this morning. It was also heard that although the committee is expected to start limiting the maximum prices of daily necessities on Monday, the price limit order formally promulgated by the French Consulate on the 19th of this month has been implemented.

### Japanese Side Confiscates Leather Boat Cargo

Takes Away Documents and Doesn't Return Them, Then Forcibly Detains Boat Cargo

The Continental Times reported that yesterday (23rd) there was a cargo boat full of leather moored in the Huangpu River. Japanese military police asked to see the customs documents. A Chinese man on the boat handed over the documents. Unexpectedly, after the Japanese military police checked the documents, they refused to return them and took the documents away. After a while, another two Japanese military police in military uniforms asked the Chinese man for the documents. The Chinese man had nothing to answer, so he explained that his documents had been taken away. However, the Japanese military police still took the boat and cargo to the Shui Shang Hotel in the Wai Bai Du Bridge area, and it was heard that they had been confiscated.

### Thrift Committee Launches Campaign to Quit Smoking and Drinking - Urges Citizens to Respond and Implement Unanimously - Save Consumption and Reduce the Burden of Life

The local Thrift Action Committee believes that the soaring prices in Shanghai and the increasingly serious problems of life can only be overcome by practicing thrift in this turbulent situation. Therefore, it has launched a campaign to quit smoking and drinking, hoping that all walks of life will respond and implement it unanimously to save unnecessary consumption. The letter issued by the association to the citizens is as follows: Dear compatriots from all walks of life, recently

Prices in the isolated island have soared again and again, especially rice and coal, and the rise has reached an unprecedented peak. Not only are the poor people severely threatened, but even middle- and upper-class people feel stretched. The entire society is already trapped in a flood of life panic. In this

turbulent and uneasy situation, the only way for us to stabilize life and overcome difficulties is to reduce material enjoyment and practice wartime thrift. The meaning of thrift is to have moderation in life and restraint in consumption. All unnecessary consumption and wasteful extravagance should be saved. We believe that in daily life, the consumption of smoking and drinking is the most undesirable and harmful to health. In today's rice and firewood,

quitting smoking and drinking should not be hesitated any longer. Moreover, the price of smoking and drinking has also risen as much as rice. If we calculate the consumption statistics of smoking and drinking in Shanghai, the amount is really alarming. Also, the raw materials of expensive smoking and drinking are all foreign goods, and the value is so high that people are amazed. The annual outflow of gold and ocean is always

tens of millions yuan or more. This large amount of leakage is undoubtedly a major loss to the country in terms of wartime economy, and it is also an unnecessary magic wand for personal economy. Moreover, since Shanghai fell into the hands of the enemy, both smoking and drinking have been subject to micro-taxation by the Japanese puppet agency. We

smoking and drinking not only increase our own burden, but also help the Japanese puppet to collect more taxes. This is really undesirable in today's tense and severe national crisis. In view of this, our association has launched a campaign to quit smoking and drinking, and earnestly hopes that all compatriots in the city will make up their minds to quit

bad habits, save unnecessary consumption, and should try to reduce them even if they are too deeply ingrained, and try to use domestic products as much as possible under favorable conditions. This is not only beneficial to ourselves, but also beneficial to the country. We hope that our dear compatriots will quickly rise up and respond unanimously, and we cannot help but pray sincerely.

### Coal Industry Requests Opening of the Jiji Bureau: Massive Supply of Coal Needed; Pre-War Supply and Sales Reached 80,000 to 90,000 Tons Monthly; Current Public Allocation is Only 5%

Mr. Yu Qiaqing, a prominent figure in Shanghai's business community, sent a letter to the Shanghai Coal Trade Association on the 16th of this month, urging them to find ways to control coal prices and to discuss both short-term and long-term solutions. The Coal Trade Association replied to Mr. Yu yesterday, stating, "Respectfully, we received your letter dated February 16th, noting that the daily increase in coal prices has a profound impact on people's livelihoods, and that the Jiji coal price has also risen despite the bureau not increasing supply. You urged us to find ways to control prices and discuss both short-term and long-term solutions, which demonstrates your enthusiasm for society and concern for the people's welfare. We are deeply grateful. However, we have found that before August 13th, our members sold 80,000 to 90,000 tons of Jiji coal per month. Currently, the allocated amount is only about 5% of the pre-war level. Therefore, our members who sell Jiji coal have very limited supplies and can only provide fixed quantities and old customers at a fair price, which is far from sufficient. As a fundamental solution, we should ask you to forward a letter to the Jiji Bureau, promptly approving a massive supply to our members, so that our members can universally supply all Shanghai citizens to purchase at a fair price. We are responding accordingly and hope you will consider it."

Firewood and Charcoal Industry Must Meet Retail Demand

Since the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce received a letter from the Firewood and Charcoal Trade Association, requesting that the Chamber forward it to the coal briquette factories, informing each factory to appropriately allocate and supply the necessary goods to the various firewood and charcoal retail stores during the fair price period in order to meet retail demand, the Chamber of Commerce forwarded the letter to the Coal Briquette Factory Association, stating, "The source of coal briquettes sold by firewood and charcoal stores comes from the supply of your Association members. During the afternoon's purchase and sale transactions, it is necessary to appropriately allocate according to the original agreement, so as to meet retail demand. This will balance supply and demand, and prevent the general public from crowding at the doors of coal factories. This is beneficial to both parties. We hope your Association will inform its members and earnestly implement it." Yesterday, the Joint Association of Coal, Firewood, and Charcoal Stores also sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, requesting the coal briquette factories to supply retail sales immediately to benefit poor households.

Users Call for Flattening Briquette Prices

The Garment Industry Workers' Union, due to the necessity of coal briquettes for ironing clothes by its members, and now finding it impossible to purchase them even at the fixed price, feels strongly and sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions yesterday, suggesting six points to benefit users. The original letter is recorded below, "Since the announcement of the fixed price of coal briquettes, coal stores not only cannot sell at the fixed price, but also refuse to supply goods to the market. It is impossible to purchase them, making it impossible to start work, and the impact is extremely great. However, one cannot say that the fixed price is not good; it is truly the merchants who are detestable, obviously manipulating and hoarding without doubt. News reports indicate that there are as many as 22,400 white tons in the warehouse receipts of hoarders, which is infuriating upon reading. This type of hoarding should be taken over and sold at a fair price to stop this evil trend. Now, reading the advertisement of the holders of coal briquette warehouse receipts, they deny hoarding and point to the warehouse receipts as short selling by the coal briquette factories, and say that the factories deliberately reduce production, creating a shortage to sell at a good price. It is impossible for outsiders to know which of the two is true, but both hoarders and short sellers should be sanctioned by society, and fixed-price coal briquettes should be widely sold to benefit the common people. Therefore,"

Suggesting Six Points

(1) The 22,400 tons of coal briquettes hoarded should be forcibly cleared and sold at a fair price within a limited time. Overdue goods should be purchased at the original price and sold publicly. (2) A thorough investigation should be conducted on the total number of finished coal briquettes currently in stock at the coal briquette factories to confirm whether there are truly more than 12,400 tons. If only coal dust exists without coal briquettes, it is obvious that the factory is short selling, and the limited time for delivery is purely deceptive and should be strictly sanctioned. (Because the output of coal briquette factories in the entire city is only ten thousand tons in ten days, even if all the output is supplied to clear the warehouse receipts, it is already greatly short, let alone supply fair-price sales.) (3) From March 1st, it should be stipulated that coal briquette factories should produce and sell on the spot and not issue warehouse receipts. (4)

Strict Enforcement

Factory price is 110 yuan, and the retail price is limited to 5 yuan 8 jiao. If there is any violation, the law should be enforced. (5) The production capacity of each coal briquette factory should be investigated, and production should not be deliberately reduced. (6) Secret manipulation and hoarding by coal briquette stores should be strictly prohibited to promote universal availability and maintain it for a long time.

### Only Joining Group Purchase of Rice Can Lower Rice Prices; Large-Scale Procurement on the Spot is Tantamount to Aiding Abuse; Many Trading Houses Entrust Direct Orders; Dough Stores Apply for Relief

The Shanghai People's Food Regulation Association is implementing group purchases of foreign rice and transporting it to Shanghai to regulate the people's food supply. Many groups, organizations, companies, and factories have entrusted the Association to place orders, which has become very crowded. The Association has telegraphed Saigon to order a total of 26 batches of No. 2 foreign rice, totaling approximately 50,000 bags. The 16th batch was ordered yesterday by the Procurement Committee via telegram at a price of 55 yuan per bag. The highest previous intermediary price was 59 yuan 4 jiao. Apart from the first batch of 6,000 bags that has already arrived in Shanghai and been distributed to each subscriber, the remaining batches will be transported to Shanghai on schedule. The number of people registering with the Association to purchase rice daily is one or two thousand bags. In addition, foreign rice directly ordered by various banks, factories, and companies through foreign firms totals 50,000 bags and will soon arrive in Shanghai. It is hoped that all sectors will actively participate in the group purchase of rice to increase Shanghai's rice supply. The United Association of Citizens of the First Special District has also issued a public announcement urging active subscription, stating that solving the food problem today should not involve large-scale local procurement. Procurement in Shanghai not only fails to increase the rice supply, but also makes the rice supply increasingly tight, posing a great threat to the poor. It is hoped that all sectors will pay attention.

Also, Rice Merchants are Raising Prices for Sale. Ma Xincheng, a Chinese detective of the Political Department of the Public Concession Police, and Shen Xiaochang, a Chinese detective, discovered Zhou Baogen carrying five dou of white rice at the intersection of Weihaiwei Road and Chengdu Road. Fearing that the source was unclear, they went forward to investigate. According to Zhou, the rice was purchased from the Dafu Rice Store at No. 6, Alley 92, Xinzha Road, for 24 yuan. The detectives, believing that the rice store exceeded the fixed price, immediately went to arrest Guan Miaorong, an old clerk. The detectives also found that the white rice sold by the Runtai Rice Store at No. 812, Haining Road, was priced at 50 yuan per dan. They went and arrested Cao Xiyan, the accountant, and Yang Chunsheng, a staff member. All three were sent to the Ninth Criminal Court of the First Special Court yesterday morning. Li Zhishan, a lawyer of the police station, filed a lawsuit in accordance with the law. After questioning by Judge Shen, Guan, Cao, and Yang were each sentenced to 15 days of detention as a warning.

Noodle Industry Vows Not to Hoard; After the noodle shops of the Shanghai Machine-Made Noodle Trade Association were forced to suspend business from February 19 due to the soaring price of flour, they appealed to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and the Shanghai Municipal Council for relief. After negotiation, it was agreed to allocate 1,822 bags of flour to the noodle industry daily. All noodle shops resumed business yesterday, selling machine-made noodles at a fair price of 2 jiao 3 fen per city jin until sold out, without raising prices. The situation was reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is learned that the Noodle Industry Association submitted a document to the Municipal Council yesterday, stating, "We hereby submit this document regarding the lack of flour. We are deeply grateful for your Bureau's fair price consideration for the poor. Our industry temporarily suspended business due to a lack of raw materials. We appealed to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce for relief. We were introduced by the Chamber of Commerce to meet Deputy Director He, which resulted in a solution. Deputy Director He agreed to supply flour, which our Association will be responsible for distributing to each store for use. We will immediately comply with the discussion and open for business. After receiving the flour, responsible personnel and store owners must not hoard or sell, or raise prices for profit. If the above occurs, we voluntarily cancel our business license and accept the authorities' punishment. We hereby submit this document, hoping for your review." Dough stores are applying for relief. Although the dough store industry in the three cities is a small business, it is extremely widespread, covering the entire city. It is commonly known as Hubei noodle restaurants, as those engaged in this industry have always been led by Hubei natives. Recently, due to the high price of daily necessities, the price of flour and fuel has doubled, and those with meager capital have been unable to maintain it, and they are about to be forced to suspend business entirely, and their livelihoods are in danger. The leaders of the industry have directly applied to the authorities of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for effective relief.

### New Commander of the French Defense Forces, Gasville, Arrives in Shanghai

Cassevtiie Gasville, the newly appointed commander of the French defense forces stationed in Shanghai, arrived by ship at 9:00 a.m. yesterday. At that time, the French authorities specially placed the Bund wharf on Rue du Consulat under martial law. Except for trams, all vehicles were prohibited from passing.

### Japanese Suddenly Block the Waterworks Bridgehead, Densely Deploy Barbed Wire, Those Entering Must Take a Detour

The eastern side of the waterworks bridgehead at the intersection of North Suzhou Road and North Jiangxi Road was suddenly occupied by many Japanese soldiers yesterday, who went to deploy barbed wire, horizontally cutting off North Suzhou Road, blocking the passage of vehicles and pedestrians. A wooden sign was placed in the middle of the barbed wire, with a notice in the name of the concession troops, stating that passage was prohibited here. Those who need to go to the General Post Office can enter and exit via Sichuan Road Bridge and Wenjian Shi Road. The site was originally the only thoroughfare to the General Post Office, so yesterday's sudden cutoff by the Japanese side caused many obstacles for those entering and exiting. All those going to the General Post Office had to take a detour, feeling very troubled.

### Municipal Council Plans to Shelter Concession Beggars, All Street Beggars Arrested and Sent to Shelters, Improve Their Economy and Then Repatriate Them, Estimated Cost for the First Year is Over 170,000 Yuan

In view of the continued entry of refugees from other areas and the freezing deaths of many poor people on the streets during last winter's severe cold, the Municipal Council believes that the beggar problem in the concession has become increasingly serious. In order to remedy the situation, it has now begun to promote a larger-scale relief plan so that the beggar problem in the concession can be thoroughly resolved. The above-mentioned problem has been considered by the directors and police committees of the Bureau since the beginning of winter.

Fundraising Guidelines It has been found that the expenses required for the aforementioned plan are enormous. The Municipal Council does not have such large sums of money available to meet them. Furthermore, apart from considering the police and hygiene aspects of the aforementioned problem, the Bureau can only allocate a certain amount of subsidy within a limited scope and cannot transfer funds for the purpose of relieving the poor. This is the Bureau's consistent policy. The Bureau has long followed the decision of the taxpayers' annual meeting that the funds collected according to the Land Regulations are not allowed to be used for relief purposes. For this reason, the funds required for the beggar relief plan must rely on private or public donations.

Implementation Plan As for the implementation of the beggar relief work, it cannot be undertaken by the Bureau's staff or departments. Fortunately, the Bureau has obtained the consent of the Salvation Army to have the Salvation Army preside over the matter. However, the Salvation Army's current budget does not include such large sums of money for the benefit of the public. Therefore, for their own interests, the public should bear this expense. Moreover, since this matter is deeply related to all levels of the association and should be solved by each individual, donation is imperative. All sectors have now automatically donated large sums of money (either directly or through the collection of entertainment tax) for the relief of refugees. The refugee and beggar problems are closely related, so the Bureau has considered whether the refugee relief agencies can transfer part of the funds for the aforementioned beggar relief plan. This matter is now under consideration by the various refugee relief agencies.

Relief Measures The outline of the relief measures currently being drafted can be described as follows: All street beggars will be arrested by patrolmen dispatched by the police and transferred to the beggar shelters run by the Salvation Army. The Salvation Army will take them all in. The staff in the shelters will be hired by the Salvation Army. The beggars should be forced to stay inside. After obtaining considerable guarantees, they will be sent back. The Salvation Army will take care of the beggars' food, clothing, and housing. The shelter buildings will be temporary bamboo, mud, and reed structures. The method of improving the beggars will start with education. Teachers will be hired by the shelter. In addition, if possible, efforts should be made to enable the beggars to manufacture goods. The profits earned may be allowed for themselves.

Purpose of the Event It should be stated that the main purpose of the Municipal Council is to improve the economic conditions of the beggars and repatriate them, not to allow the large group of beggars to exist forever under relief. At the same time, it is hoped that the beggars in the shelter will be gradually repatriated, so the number of people in the shelter will gradually decrease. As for the exact amount of expenses required for the above-mentioned plan, it is not easy to estimate, but according to a rough calculation based on sheltering one thousand beggars, the first year will require approximately 175,000 yuan, and each subsequent year will require 150,000 yuan. The above budget does not include the land for building the shelter.

### American President Lines to Add Several New Ships, First Ship to Launch in July, Shanghai to Europe Every Two Weeks

The North China Daily News reported that the Shanghai American President Lines has received news that the U.S. Navy Committee is building several new ships for the President Lines to circumnavigate the globe. The first ship will be launched around July 1 of this year and will set sail on October 1. Three other ships have already had their keels laid. These new ships will regularly sail to Shanghai, with one ship leaving Shanghai every two weeks, taking the Suez Canal to Europe, then sailing to New York, through the Panama Canal to Los Angeles and San Francisco. Each ship will carry both cargo and passengers. The first-class cabin can accommodate 80 to 100 passengers. The ships are each 492 feet long, with a deadweight of 16,190 tons and a range of 12,000 nautical miles.

These super-class mail ships will be the largest ships built by the United States, 740 feet long, with a speed of 24 knots, and can carry more than 1,000 passengers.

### Japan's National Plight Has Reached an Extreme, Strong Men Conscripted Empty, Women Substitute for Employment, Special Materials Exhausted, Daily Use Adopts Substitutes

Japan's war of aggression against China has been prolonged and cannot be resolved. It is heard that strong men have been conscripted, all kinds of public utilities have been changed to women's service, military preparations are exhausted, all industries have stagnated, and the people have no means of livelihood. The following is a record of the various situations.

Strong Men Exhausted, Women Mobilized

A Da Guang She reporter learned from a certain foreigner who had just arrived in Shanghai from Japan yesterday that Japan's aggression against China was not the original intention of the Japanese government. It was actually instigated repeatedly by the militarist warlords. Initially, the Japanese government, surrounded by young military officers, sent only the Third Fleet to China. The remaining First and Second Fleets remained to protect important military ports such as Sasebo, preparing for an attempt in the Pacific during the European war, hoping to quickly resolve the war against China and then look south and north. However, the Chinese side prepared for a long-term war of resistance, inflicting heavy blows on the Japanese army, resulting in it being unable to extricate itself and repeatedly sending urgent dispatches to the country for reinforcements. The country's regular army, reserve soldiers, and retired veterans have been conscripted empty. Almost all Japanese are in military service, and most industries and commerce have stagnated. Today, the government believes that public utilities in important cities cannot be allowed to stop. They have had no choice but to force women to mobilize and take over men's jobs. In places such as Tokyo, Osaka, Kobe, Moji, Sugaka, and Yokohama, 70 to 80 percent of the post offices, telegraph offices, trams, buses, trains, water and electricity plants, hotels, schools, shops, and factories are run by women.

Controlled Goods Exhausted

The Japanese army's invasion of China has expanded the war zone, and military supplies have been exhausted. Gasoline, wood, hardware, food, horse fodder, and all military-related goods in the country were previously subject to strict control. Now, due to the continuous war against China, the country has indeed been exhausted, and the people are suffering from the difficulty of food, the repeated increase in taxes, and the restriction of supplies. Except for the complete suspension of work in all major state-owned factories, the rest of the country's people cannot survive. Eighty percent of the people's daily necessities have been replaced by substitutes. Even small items such as ramie are entirely used for military purposes. The coarse and fine ropes and hemp threads used by various industries and civilians have all been replaced by paper substitutes, which are brown. Now, the bundling of commercial firms and factories is entirely done with paper threads, and their poverty has reached an extreme. It is transmitted that the Japanese government has continuously passed huge military expenditures, all of which are handled by the military. The collection of military expenses is only by issuing worthless paper government bonds.

### American Judge in China to Return to Shanghai Next Month

According to the current plan, Mr. Helmick will fly from Chongqing to Guangzhou on March 2 to hear several American cases, then go to Hong Kong and take the President Coolidge to Shanghai.

### Yueshe Holds Sacred Music Concert

Tonight at 8 PM in the Moore Memorial Church

In addition to broadcasting famous songs on the Gospel Radio Station on the 11th of this month, the Shanghai Yueshe will hold a sacred music concert at the Moore Memorial Church on Yu Qiaqing Road at 8:00 PM today (the 25th).

### Passengers on Shanghai-Ningbo Direct Route Ships to Be Temporarily Disembarked Outside

After the Shanghai-Zhenhai liner was specially approved to sail directly to Ningbo, the Gaodeng Wheel first loaded cargo and sailed to Ningbo. The Swiss Tai Wheel of the Norwegian Commercial Hualun Foreign Firm sailed from Shanghai to Ningbo the night before last, carrying more than 400 passengers. It was learned yesterday that the ship had safely arrived in Zhenhai Port, but the passengers it carried had not been approved by the authorities and were still being transferred to Ningbo by barge outside the port. The cargo was directly unloaded at Ningbo. The Hanas输 of the German Far East Company is scheduled to sail to Ningbo at 3:00 PM today. It is said that the ship will carry more than 600 passengers to Ningbo, and it is also planned to disembark them outside Zhenhai Port. It is expected that the Shanghai-Ningbo passenger problem can be implemented next time.

### Paramen Bloodshed This Morning, Chen Manli Seriously Injured, Hit by Three Bullets, Life Exceptionally Critical, Two Dancers Injured, One Assailant Escaped

At 0:50 this morning, a shooting incident occurred at the Paramen Dance Hall on Jing'an Temple Road and Yuyuan Road, in which the red dance star Chen Manli was shot. Chen was shot three times, and guests Liu Borong and Peng Qiutang were also injured at the same time. This incident aroused the concern of those who frequent dance halls. The reporter of this newspaper rushed to investigate, and the details are recorded as follows.

Married Twice, Extremely Popular for a Time

Red dance star Chen Manli, a native of Jiangsu, is 22 years old. With her superb dancing skills and charming appearance, she has emerged in the dance hall, and young wealthy merchants are all captivated. In the past, she married Liu Huizhi, the former manager of the Shanghai China Industrial Bank, and Zhu Ruifu, the former manager of Jiu Fu Company. Later, Liu and Zhu died one after another. Chen left the family and became a dancer again. She dances at Paramen, and her seats are often full every night. Therefore, over the years, she has accumulated quite a bit of savings and currently resides at No. 14, Kangle Village, Foch Road.

Accompanying Guests on a Light Conversation at the Invitation of Guests

At 0:50 this morning, while the music at Paramen was intermittent, there were many dancers in the hall. Liu Borong, Wang Zukang, Peng Qiutang, and a Mr. Li and a Mr. Gan danced several times in the hall. They then sat with the dancers Chen Manli and Chen Xueying on the left side of the hall for a light conversation. Chen Xueying and Peng Qiutang were originally acquainted. After sitting for a while, they returned to the dance floor, while Chen Manli, because she was having a pleasant conversation with the guests, was still chatting there.

Youth Leapt Out and Fired Three Shots

At that time, a young man in a suit suddenly jumped out from the left side of the music stage in the dance hall, took out a pistol from his sleeve, and fired three shots in a row at Chen Manli, one hitting her right neck, one hitting her left arm, and one hitting her lower back. She immediately fell to the ground. Liu Borong, a native of Shanghai, 27 years old, had just returned from Hong Kong and was temporarily staying in room 516 of the Dongya Hotel, was also hit in the right arm by a stray bullet, a minor injury. Peng Qiutang, a tea merchant from Shanghai, 27 years old, resident of No. 20, Sande Lane, Kangnuot Road, was also hit in the back by a stray bullet at the same time, suffering a more serious injury. They were sent to the Red Cross Hospital on Haige Road for treatment one after another.

Assailant Fled with Gun

Yesterday, when Chen Manli was in the dance hall, she was wearing a light yellow robe, ginger-yellow silk stockings, and black high-heeled leather shoes, with a silver flower inserted in her hair, with a charming appearance that attracted attention throughout the hall. After being injured, she bled profusely. The entire hall, under a silent atmosphere, sighed. After the incident, the assailant fled crouched with a handgun in the noisy crowd and escaped from the great gate.

Detectives Searched Without Success

According to the report from the dance hall, the police immediately ordered armed detectives to arrest the assailant. They ordered the dance hall to close the great gate tightly and searched strictly. After an hour, it was lifted. All the male and female dancers then returned. As for the cause of the case, the police in charge are investigating.

### Four Robbers and Fake Police Exchange Gunfire

Stray Bullets Fly Everywhere, Luckily No One Injured

In front of the Zhonghua Industrial Factory on Route Tenant de la Tour (now Huashan Road) in western Shanghai, an exchange of gunfire suddenly occurred around 6:00 PM the night before last. Shops in the area were extremely alarmed and closed early. However, the truth was unclear, and rumors abounded. According to an investigation by a reporter from the China News Agency, around 6:00 PM the night before last, a Mr. Yang, residing in Caojiazhai, North Caojiadu, western Shanghai, was walking through Jide Lane, a side street of Route Tenant de la Tour, when four bandits jumped out from the roadside, brandished pistols, and blocked his path. They searched Mr. Yang, seizing his money and stripping off his clothes. After obtaining the loot, the robbers fled towards Route Tenant de la Tour. After being robbed, Mr. Yang ran to a certain organization to report the incident, and a large number of plainclothes fake police officers were dispatched to surround the area. The four robbers, realizing they had been discovered and fearing capture, opened fire in the middle of the road to resist arrest. The plainclothes fake police officers also returned fire, with stray bullets flying everywhere, creating a scene like a major battle. They pursued the robbers relentlessly into the lanes of North Caojiazhai, where both sides exchanged more than twenty shots, refusing to yield. Finally, when the robbers ran out of bullets, they surrendered.

### Monks Quarrel, Incense Keeper Arrested

Yunyou Hui Xuan, 49 years old, from Hubei, entered the Fancang Temple on Route Ghisi (now Route Changle) in the French Concession a few years ago and was assigned the position of incense keeper, similar to a layperson working as a waiter. Around 3:00 PM on the 21st of this month, Hui Xuan suddenly held a small knife, threatening Hui Kai, the trustee monk of Fancang Temple, demanding 500 yuan, claiming he wanted to return to Hubei to visit relatives and needed travel expenses. Other monks in the temple persuaded him to desist and took away the knife. Later, Hui Xuan escaped. The next afternoon, Hui Xuan returned to the temple and wrote a note on red paper, demanding 150 yuan from Hui Kai, a reduction of the earlier sum. Hui Kai reported this to the French police, who sent detectives to arrest Hui Xuan. The knife was confiscated and brought to the police station as evidence. Yesterday, he was brought to the First Criminal Court of the Special No. 2 Court. The police lawyer explained the case and requested a postponement for further investigation. The detectives presented the knife as evidence. Hui Kai then testified about the defendant's knife-wielding intimidation. Hui Xuan denied threatening the temple manager with a knife, stating that he was only eager to visit his elderly mother in his hometown and had served in the temple for six months without receiving any salary. He claimed he only asked the temple manager to borrow 150 yuan for travel expenses. Judge Zhang Minsheng reviewed the testimony, scheduled a continued hearing for the 28th of the month for further investigation, and ordered the defendant detained.

In another hearing, Hui Kai (51 years old, from Suzhou), the presiding monk of Fancang Temple on Route Ghisi in the French Concession, was accused of bullying guest monks, leading to frequent quarrels. On the 21st of this month, Hui Xuan, a guest monk from Hubei residing at the temple, unable to bear the abuse, requested 150 yuan from Hui Kai to assist with travel expenses to return to his hometown in Hubei. Hui Kai not only refused but also reported to the police that Hui Xuan had threatened him with a knife, extorting money. The police arrested Hui Xuan and sent him to the Special No. 2 Court, which ordered his detention and scheduled a continued hearing for the 28th of this month.

### Tongrenhe Paint Store Faces Another Lawsuit: Employees Demand Profit Sharing; Shareholder Representative You Huai Gao Agrees to Payment; Requests Postponement for Negotiation and Reconciliation

Xu Chengxun, manager of Tongrenhe Paint Store at 80 Route Minghong (now East Nanjing Road) in the French Concession, and You Huaigao (45 years old, from Suzhou, residing at 260 Route Yian Ping (now Yanping Road)), the shareholder representative of the store, were involved in a lawsuit in the Civil Court of the Special No. 2 Court over a dispute regarding accounting and profit distribution. The preliminary hearing had just concluded. Now, seven clerks from the accounting department of Tongrenhe Paint Store—Shen Youfu, Chen Guorong, Yu Song, Chen Chuncheng, Yu Suichang, Xu Yuqing, and Gu Chuan—represented by a lawyer, filed a lawsuit in the Civil Court against You Huaigao, the shareholder representative of the store, claiming they were entitled to profit sharing and bonuses. They stated that they worked at Tongrenhe Paint Store, which had profits of 820,000 yuan in 1939 and 560,000 yuan in 1937, but no profit sharing or bonuses were distributed. According to the store's regulations, the profit sharing was divided into fifteen shares, with shareholders receiving ten shares and employees receiving five shares. However, the store suddenly ceased operations last year, and the profit sharing due to the employees was delayed. They claimed that the employees were entitled to more than 100,000 yuan in profit sharing and requested the court to order payment. Upon receiving the complaint, the court, presided over by Judge Yu Changzi, opened the Seventh Civil Court for trial yesterday morning. The plaintiffs and their lawyer appeared in court and recounted the events. The defendant, represented by lawyer Qiu Fenling, responded that the defendant acknowledged the plaintiffs' entitlement to profit sharing. However, because the accounts were still being settled at the accounting firm and had not yet been finalized, and because the plaintiffs had different tenures and some were not entitled to profit sharing, he requested a postponement to allow both parties to negotiate and reconcile outside of court. The court, considering the circumstances, granted the request for a postponement for further hearing.

### Will the Battlefield Shift to the Ice-Covered Arctic Ocean? Soviet Union Breaks Through Mannerheim Line; What Route Will British Aid Take?

Western European countries have an object of fear, and that is the Soviet Union. The outcome of the World War, which has evolved for months, has now formed a central point: the Finnish issue. This World War is distinctly different from the last one in that the Soviet Union, a brand-new political system, has emerged in the world. Because of the existence of such a new

Two Deadly Enemies

political system, the countries in opposition are deeply afraid that the war will be prolonged, and the economic strength of their countries will be dragged down until they are exhausted and impoverished. When the war has a victory or defeat, the right to dictate peace terms will not be in the hands of Western European democratic countries as it was at the end of the last war, but in the hands of another political system's forces, which will fundamentally overthrow the existing ruling class. Therefore, the core of the problem is to defeat National Socialism without allowing the Soviet Union's power to expand. As a result, the focus of the war has shifted from the Western Front in Europe to the Baltic Sea over the past few months. Recent news reports that the British fleet has suddenly appeared in Petsamo, the northernmost part of Finland. If this news is true, the situation in Europe may have a new development soon.

Petsamo is a port in the far north of Finland. Although within the Arctic Circle, it does not freeze over for several months like some ports in the Baltic Sea due to the warm currents. When the Soviet Union launched the war against Finland, it soon occupied Petsamo. The military significance of this is naturally to seize Finland's access to the sea, cutting off its external supplies. Finland, having lost its only access to the sea, and the Baltic Sea being blockaded by Germany, the only land transportation route is with Sweden. Although Britain and France are determined to aid Finland, it is impossible to directly supply Finland with military supplies. Sweden and Norway have also recently expressed their strict neutrality due to the excessive pressure exerted on them by Germany. In this situation, it has become a question for Britain and France to maintain Finland's outpost position so that it can continue to resist.

Now the Soviet Union has broken through the Mannerheim Line in southern Finland and advanced to Viborg (also known as Viipuri). The Soviet army is attacking the Finnish army with overwhelming force, and it is difficult for Finland to last. Of course, it will take time for the Soviet Union to occupy Vasa, the new capital in the far west, but the current moment is crucial. If Finland does not have external supplies and its important internal cities are occupied by the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union will use a situation of crushing an egg with a stone to deal with the Finnish army. Then, the defeat of the

A Storm Rises in the Arctic Ocean

Finnish army will not be so far away. Is the British navy's activity in the Arctic Ocean at this time an attempt to land in Petsamo to provide remote support to Finland? Of course, there are many difficulties. First, Petsamo is already under Soviet control, and it is a narrow, protruding access to the sea, which is conducive to defense and not conducive to attack. Borrowing a road through Norway is not permissible under Norway's neutrality. Second, the Soviet Union declared that if British warships enter Soviet territorial waters, the Soviet navy will take immediate action. Although the Soviet navy is not as numerous as the British navy, the Soviet navy has a special experience that the British navy lacks, that is, the Soviet navy constantly practices icebreaking navigation. Fighting in this area will inevitably cause many difficulties due to the special situation. Therefore, although Britain is determined to aid Finland, it may not take any hostile action at present. From this point of view, the news of the British fleet appearing in the Arctic Ocean, even if reliable, does not have any decisive effect on the Soviet-Finnish war.

A Corner of the Battlefield

### Full-Scale Containment War in Western Zhejiang: Intensifying Attacks in Western Zhejiang to Counter Invasions in Eastern Zhejiang

— Zhang Yezhou

Following the Japanese army's crossing of the Qiantang River and landing in Xiaoshan, threatening Ning Shao, Western Zhejiang, which had been quiet for a long time, has launched a full-scale attack to contain the Japanese army's rear and support the Chinese army's defense war on the south bank.

The so-called "full-scale attack" is divided into six routes advancing simultaneously: namely, the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway, the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, the Su-Jia Road, the Beijing-Shanghai Road, the Hangping Highway, and the Hangshan Highway.

The main objective of the Chinese army responsible for containing the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway is to cut off the connection between Hangzhou and Wuxing. Their activities are focused on the area from Wukang Sanqiaopu to Yuhang Minlinpu, launching frontal attacks, and being ready to strike at any time in Bailushan, Pingyao, Penggong, Matouguan, Sheshan, Dingqiao, Digongshan, Shangbai, and other places, and collaborating with the third branch army in Gaoqiao, northwest of Fuyang, Linghu, southeast of Wuxing, and Xinshi, northeast of Deqing, to complete the plan to encircle the Japanese army on the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway.

The main objective of the Chinese army responsible for containing the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway is to cut off the connection between Hangzhou and Jiaxing. Their activities are focused on the area from Jianping, Hangxian County, to Wangdian, Xiuyu, launching frontal attacks, with particular emphasis on Linping, Chang'an, Xiashi, and Wangdian. They will also launch attacks in Tanglou, Liuxia Gongchen Bridge, Songmuchi, Xiangfu Bridge, Lingjia Bridge, and other places to complete the plan to encircle Hangzhou.

The main objective of the Chinese army responsible for containing the Su-Jia Road is to cut off the connection between Jiaxing and Suzhou. Their activities are focused on launching frontal attacks along the Wangjiangjing to Wujiang line, and launching attacks in Xinsheng, Bianlin, Wuzhen, and Yanmu, and contacting friendly forces in Taihu Lake to complete the plan to encircle Suzhou.

The main objective of the Chinese army responsible for containing the Beijing-Shanghai Road is to cut off the connection between Nanjing and Pinghu Jiaxing, so that the Japanese army in Jing Changxi Su cannot be reinforced from Xinsheng to Pinghu, and from Xinmu to Jiaxing. This will also threaten Changzhou and Wuxi, making the Japanese army in Jiangsu restless and unable to spare any strength to reinforce the Japanese army in Western Zhejiang. – This route and the Su-Jia line are both aimed at cutting off the traffic between Jiangsu and Zhejiang, so that the plan to annihilate the Japanese army in Western Zhejiang can be completed in one fell swoop.

The Chinese army responsible for containing the Hangping Highway is the main force supporting the Xindong Chinese army. Its objective is to contain the Japanese army on the north bank of the Qiantang River, preventing them from continuously reinforcing the south bank. It will also wait for the Japanese army on the south bank to retreat north across the river, so that it can ambush and annihilate them. The main attack strongholds are Jianqiao, Qiaosi, Yuanjiaba, Hujiaer, Haining, Babao, Xincang, Zhakou, Huangwan, Haiyan, Zhapu, and Pinghu, with Hujiaer, Haining, Zhakou, Haiyan, and Zhapu being the most important. They will also launch attacks along this line in Chang'an, Shitangtou, Dingqiao, Yuanhua, Tongyuan, and other towns to shake the morale of the Japanese army on the north bank of the Qiantang River. It can also cut off the connection between Pudong and Western Zhejiang.

The main objective of the Chinese army responsible for containing the Hangshan Highway is to cut off the connection between Hangzhou and Jiashan. Their activities should focus on destroying the highways from Jiaxing to Puyuan, Chongde to Tongxiang, and Tongxiang to Puyuan, and launching attacks in Lutou, Tudian Temple, Beirihui Bridge, Tingzi Bridge, Shimenwan, Dagaoyang, Xiaogaoyang, Zhouquan, Hanshan, Changqiao, Dama, Bushe, and other places. This will also control the Japanese army's use of the Grand Canal's waterways.

The six-pronged attack plan described above has been launched separately, and with the good news from the Chinese army in Eastern Zhejiang, the morale of the army has been boosted. The author has interviewed several guerrilla leaders, who all believe that the decisive battle is imminent and success can be expected! Since the reporter left Zhejiang and returned, small-scale contacts have begun in various places. It is expected that the flames of resistance against Japan in Western Zhejiang will be reignited soon, answering the Japanese army's dream of invading Xiaoshao with facts!

Notes on Contemporary Figures

### Mr. Wu Zhongxin, Who Presided Over the Enthronement Ceremony of the Dalai Lama

— Yu Zhen

He has a resolute personality to overcome all difficulties; determined to win the sincerity of all Tibetan people with his own sincerity.

Mr. Wu Zhongxin, who went to Tibet this time to attend the enthronement ceremony of the 14th Dalai Lama, is from Hefei, Anhui. He is 55 years old this year. His parents died early in his childhood, and he was raised by his widowed sister-in-law. His uncle was the former Qing Zhenjiang garrison commander, so when he grew to be ten years old, he followed his uncle and lived his young master's life. A staff member named Liu lived in the same room with him, and they got along very well. However, in Staff member Liu's eyes, the young Wu Zhongxin was just the child of an official family, a thorough young master. So when he decided to go to the Jiangnan Army School at a teenager, Staff member Liu, while preparing some items for him, said so certainly when discussing this matter with others. "Look at him, how can a young master like him endure that kind of hardship? I think he will definitely return soon." These words were heard very clearly by the young Wu Zhongxin and kept spinning in his mind.

He went to school, and in fact, from that time on, he certainly tasted bitterness. The strict life of the military academy initially made him feel very painful. When he could not bear it any longer, he repeatedly wanted to withdraw from school. However, every time he thought of Staff member Liu's words, he hardened his heart and endured again. His resolute personality would not allow himself to fall into other people's expectations. He struggled desperately, endured, and overcame all the difficulties, finally defeating Staff member Liu's prediction. The three years of military school life made him stronger. There, he not only learned military science, but also strengthened his indomitable and resolute character, and laid the foundation for his future achievements.

After coming out of military school, he joined the Tongmenghui. In the fifth year of the Republic of China, he was ordered to be responsible for the anti-Yuan movement in Shanghai with Chen Yingshi and others. The plans for assassinating Zheng Rucheng and seizing the Zhaohuo warship were mostly Wu's plans. Later, Mr. Chen Yingshi was murdered by Yuan's party in Shanghai. He was right next to him, and the first shot fired by the murderer hit his incisors. At that time, he fell to the ground very alertly, pretending to be dead and escaping. Mr. Chen Yingshi died at that time.

Since the 25th year of the Republic of China, Wu Zhongxin has been a member of the Mongolian-Tibetan Affairs Commission. Since Mr. Wu took office, he has been deeply aware of the past mistakes of only paying attention to political players active in Tibet and not making actual contact with those in charge. Therefore, he worked hard to contact the Regent Dalai Lama. Mr. Wu himself also has a deep understanding of Buddhism, which is understood by the Tibetans. The relationship between the Han and Tibetans has been revived. Since the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Tibetan government and the people have unanimously supported China. The Buddhist Association also often prays for China's victory in the War of Resistance Against Japan. From this, it can be seen that the true unity of the Chinese nation has a solid foundation. When the 14th Dalai Lama was reincarnated and the enthronement ceremony was held, Mr. Wu Zhongxin was ordered by the government to preside over the ceremony. After receiving the order, Mr. Wu went from Chongqing to Hong Kong, and from Hong Kong, he went to Tibet via Rangoon and India. He was welcomed everywhere along the way. He was also treated well by the British when he passed through British-controlled areas. Before leaving, Mr. Wu had already decided to enter Tibet alone, regardless of all dangers, and would not bring any weapons. He was determined to win the sincerity of all the Tibetan people with his own sincerity, only seeking that Tibet can cooperate with the central government in good faith, in order to achieve the goals of national unity, self-liberation, and common efforts.

Mr. Wu arrived in Tibet early last month. Everything went smoothly for him in Tibet, and the welcome he received from the Tibetans was unprecedented. From then on, the Chinese nation strengthened its unity and embarked on a new and prosperous path, opening up a new chapter in history.

### How to Live in a Group

— Yang Chunlu

The new semester has begun. Children, after spending more than ten days of free life at home, you are now living in a group at school again. There are many children in the school, and teachers are leading you to work and play. How happy!

But this group life, first of all, should have a spirit of autonomy, being able to manage yourself. If everything requires the teacher to supervise, then the result will certainly not be good. Therefore, no matter what you do, you should do it yourself. Everyone makes laws, everyone obeys the laws. This way, you can have a happy life.

Living in a group, secondly, you should have a spirit of sacrifice, not only caring about yourself, but always caring about the group. In a group, there is only the freedom of the group, and no personal freedom. If everyone entrusts me to do something, or it's my turn to do something, I must do my best and not be lazy, and I must not shirk my responsibility.

Living in a group, thirdly, you should have a spirit of love, being able to live together and share weal and woe. If one person can't do something, everyone helps. When you are together, you should love each other. If you often scold and hit people, this kind of person is not worthy of living in a group.

Also, in group life, what cannot be ignored is public health. Everyone is responsible for maintaining the cleanliness of public places. The prevention of infectious diseases is even more important.

Dear children! Living in a group at school, I hope you can practice according to the words above. At the same time, you must also promote your group and make everyone practice it. This way, you can get good results. This kind of group is a healthy group!

### American Children Learn to Use Chinese Chopsticks

— Shadow Stay

When Easterners meet Westerners, a very interesting gathering recently unfolded in the Chinatown area of New York. In a Chinese restaurant, many American children and some Chinese-American children were eating together. The most interesting thing at this gathering was American children learning to use Chinese chopsticks, while Chinese children listened to explanations of various American dishes. This gathering was initiated by the American Bureau for Medical Aid to China, and about fifty children participated, all accompanied by their mothers. The gathering took place at a Chinese restaurant at 20 Mott Street. During the meal, a Mrs. Zhou explained that the gathering had two purposes: first, to provide an opportunity for American and Chinese children to meet, promote mutual friendship, and gain a deeper understanding; and second, to raise donations to help wounded Chinese soldiers and refugees.

For this reason, during the gathering, Mrs. Zhou gave an impromptu speech discussing cultural issues between China and the United States, comparing Chinese culture with American culture. At the same time, each participating child donated 25 cents (US) to purchase medicine to help wounded Chinese soldiers. A Mrs. Zhang also assisted Mrs. Zhou in all the gathering and fundraising efforts. Many of the American children attending the gathering were clearly eating Chinese food for the first time. So, the way the Chinese dishes were served surprised them. The dishes included chicken broth, Chinese scrambled eggs, almond chicken with shredded cabbage on top, roasted duck with nuts, lobster egg soup, sweet and spicy pork, white rice, almond cookies, fresh fruit, and Chinese tea.

What surprised the American children the most were the very long Chinese chopsticks. After an explanation, both boys and girls tapped the chopsticks on the table, trying to learn how to hold them and attempting to use them to pick up food. Following Mrs. Zhou's speech, many Chinese children showed the American children how to use chopsticks to eat. Each American child studied intently, but often couldn't manage and had to be assisted by the Chinese child sitting next to them. However, when the meal began, they still tried to eat with Chinese chopsticks. One American child even used a fork to put food onto the chopsticks, and then used the chopsticks to put it in their mouth! This was truly a "East meets West" way of eating.

### Sharp

— Jin Zhen

Ah Hui's school has been in session for about three weeks, and the courses have gradually become more intense. Even today, a holiday, the teacher asked them to do paper crafts at home: cutting and pasting colorful paper into a landscape painting. After he finished breakfast, he started working.

All the necessary tools for the work—scissors, paper cutter, pencil, ruler, glue... etc.—were prepared. He picked up the scissors to cut the paper, but the scissors were very dull, causing the paper to be cut jaggedly, not neatly at all. So he found a brick and had to sharpen the scissors himself. Sure enough, in no time, the scissors were very sharp, and the sound of cutting paper became crisp and quick, unlike before when it was laborious, and the cuts were also very neat. But he was careless for a moment and touched the tip of the scissors, and of course, he felt a bit of pain, and then blood flowed out. He quickly asked Ah Ming—his older brother—for some red medicine, and the bleeding gradually stopped.

"Brother, have you ever thought about this question? Why do sharp things hurt people?" Ah Ming always liked to ask such seemingly obvious questions, but he had good intentions, wanting to increase his younger brother's simple everyday knowledge.

"Because it's sharp!" Ah Hui replied without thinking.

"Your answer is as good as no answer because your answer is not what I'm asking. Think about it: sharp things hurt people, this is a natural phenomenon. And your answer only conforms to: what kind of things hurt people? It must be sharp things. You need to know why there is such a phenomenon? Why doesn't a dull thing hurt?"

"This... I, I don't know, do you know?" Ah Hui heard his brother asking questions relentlessly, so of course, he stared blankly and couldn't answer.

"We should have a thorough understanding of this kind of daily encountered problem, but we often tend to be careless and don't pay attention to it. Why can a needle penetrate cloth but a thick nail cannot? Why do sharp things hurt people? This is the same principle. If we take a needle and use the same force to pierce a piece of cloth, the needle is much easier to pierce, what is the reason for this? Simply put: the force we use is the same, but the pressure generated is not the same: on the needle, the pressure is concentrated at the sharp tip of the needle, while on the nail, it is distributed on the larger, dull end of the nail, but although the force is the same, the pressure at the needle tip is several times greater than the pressure at the nail end, so the needle can easily pierce the cloth and hurt people. As for why knives need to be sharpened all the time? It is to make the blade extremely fine, so that it is easier to cut things, because it concentrates the force on the extremely fine sharpness. These different phenomena have the same principle. This is entirely a matter of physics, and you will be able to understand it more thoroughly in the future." Ah Ming finished saying these many words. Then Ah Hui began to do his paper craft, and soon it was lunchtime again. So, this whole half-day passed like this.

### What Kind of Animal is a Whale?

— New Fang

When Hua Er went to his general knowledge class today, the topic the teacher taught was "Whales." The teacher asked him: "What kind of animal does a whale belong to?" Hua Er thought that since a whale is called a fish, then undoubtedly it belongs to the fish category. But the teacher said, "Incorrect." None of the students in the whole classroom could answer this question. In the end, the teacher had to explain: "A whale does not belong to the fish category, it is a mammal. All fish are cold-blooded, while whales are warm-blooded animals. Secondly, the offspring of whales grow up relying on the milk of their mothers. Therefore, whales should belong to the mammal category. Everyone must not think that since a whale is called a fish, then it naturally belongs to the fish category."

Then, the teacher said: "Good children, from this, we can also gain some common sense about dealing with the world, which is that for all things, do not just observe their surface, but should engage in studying their actual situation; I hope everyone can remember these two sentences."

### Black Brothers (7)

— One Wood

From this window, you can see a range of mountains, and below is exactly where Hundred Treasure Valley is located; especially clearly visible is the mountain peak of the Overturned Golden River. At this time, it was near dusk, and the rocks on the top of the mountain were rendered red and purple by the remaining light of the setting sun, which was very beautiful; and the blood-red clouds, also terrifyingly, seemed to be sticking out their tongues, trembling on the rocks; and the golden river was even brighter, flowing from one precipice to another, all the way down, golden and bright, like a real gold bar, flickering and undulating, and at the same time, two wide rainbows happened to be smeared across it, making it feel particularly magnificent, but in a short while, it slowly dissipated.

Ge Le looked at it for a while, and unconsciously shouted out: "Ah! If this river was really full of gold, how wonderful that would be!" Suddenly, he heard a clear, metallic sound in his ear, saying: "Ge Le, this river will not have gold." Ge Le jumped up and exclaimed: "Huh, who is that?" He turned around and looked, but didn't see anyone; he looked around again, and looked under the table, but clearly didn't see anyone, so he sat down at the window again. This time he didn't make a sound, but was secretly thinking in his heart that if this river really turned into gold, it could be taken and used endlessly, wouldn't that be convenient? At that moment, the metallic voice said even louder: "My child, this cannot be done."

Ge Le was extremely surprised, and shouted again: "This is strange, what exactly is going on?" So he looked around the corners of the walls, and also looked in the wall closet, but didn't see anyone. He thought that maybe someone was hiding behind him, so he stood in the middle and spun his body many times, but still saw nothing, and the same voice rang in his ear again, this time singing happily "La la—Li la—," what was sung didn't have any words, just a kind of fluctuating sound wave, like the sound of water boiling in a kettle, Ge Le peered out the window to look, no, it must be in the house. On the upper floor or lower floor; no, it was clearly in the same room, the sound wave was faster and clearer, constantly singing "La la—Li la—La." Ge Le listened intently, and immediately identified that the sound was especially loud next to the stove. He immediately walked to the side of the stove, and looked towards the fire opening of the stove, only then did he realize that the sound was coming from the pot melting the golden cup. He opened the lid of the pot, and couldn't help but take a step back, shocked like anything, it turned out that it was really the pot singing! He stood in the farthest corner of the room, raised both hands, and opened his mouth wide, and waited for one or two minutes, and the singing stopped, but then clearly and happily shouted: "Hello!" Ge Le didn't dare to make a sound. The pot had already shouted again: "Hello! Ge Le, my child."

Ge Le mustered all his courage, rushed to the side of the stove, picked up the pot, and looked inside. The gold had already melted, and the bottom of the pot was smooth and bright, like a golden river surface; but what was reflected was not Ge Le's own head, but a red nose with a pair of bright eyes, shooting out from under the golden residue, exactly meeting his gaze, it was his old friend from the golden cup, the nose was redder than before, and the eyes were brighter than before.

### Returning from Beyond the Great Wall – Memoirs of a Mongolian Photography Trip (Part II)

— Yao Shiquan (Chongqing Aviation News)

We spent seven days living in the vast desert, unable to find a well when we were thirsty, and drinking dead, stinky water for three days. We ate six days of white rice soaked in salt, and filmed a total of 500 feet of film. Village transportation depended on camels in the desert. We captured the harmonious relationship between Mongolians and Manchus, many novel customs in Mongolian yurts... especially the various expressions of affection from Mongolian compatriots towards us, which provided a great deal of spiritual comfort. It dispelled the fatigue of the journey, but this comfort was not just for personal matters. Han and Mongolian compatriots have become even more united in this great era of the War of Resistance!

After the training class graduated in Ningxia, the location for the second term was in Suiyuan. The photography team set off with them and arrived in Suiyuan. Wuyuan, the frontline, was bustling everywhere. Old women were looking at murals, young children were pasting slogans, and even girls with bound feet were participating in women's movement work after unbinding their feet. The flames of the War of Resistance had been ignited in every corner!

The "Ba Si Po Nong" in western Suiyuan had just won a victory. Our team and representatives from all walks of life went to work on the frontlines. Seeing our loyal and brave soldiers who were fighting bloody battles against the enemy, the respect and emotion in our hearts made us want to shed tears of joy! Soon, we went to "Su Long Kai Wan" to film our cavalry troops. The majestic iron cavalry charged towards my "camera" like an overwhelming force. Our brave "Cossacks"! Their heroic spirit gave us even more confidence in annihilating the enemy. Leaving "Su Long Kai Wan" to film the guerrilla army in the Daqing Mountains, we unexpectedly met a former colleague from Shanghai. We felt it was too unexpected to meet in this environment. This was a loyal and brave soldier in the film industry, and now he was wearing a gray cloth military uniform as a staff officer in the guerrilla team.

A few days before leaving Suiyuan, the head of the political section of the class accompanied us to "71 Geda" in Mongolian territory to take photos. We were also assisted in our work by several male and female comrades from the Provincial Moving Committee, for which we were very grateful.

At dusk – we arrived at "71 Geda." By this time, "Kang Wang" of "Urat Banner," the female commander Ba of "East Gong Banner," and the female commander Qi of "West Gong Banner," had led various princes, officials, Mongolian troops... in formation to greet us by the road. Everyone had a brief snack at the post station and switched to tall horses to prepare for crossing the desert at night. Hundreds of Mongolian iron cavalry led the way, marching in a mighty formation! Heading towards the Lama Temple. When we were about to reach our destination, Mongolians and lamas suddenly swarmed forward, running wildly, chasing Kang Wang's fine horse. They rushed to the front of the horse with lightning speed and knelt down to kowtow, which was a sign of respect for the Wang Ye (Kang Wang). ...

### Stills from Xi Xiaobo's "Four Scholars"

### Review of "Peerless Beauty"

— Juan

Hu Die, who had been away from the film industry for several years, has returned to the screen.

"Peerless Beauty" is Hu Die's first work after returning to the screen. I went to the New Light Cinema with a longing and expectant heart to see her first performance.

I was not disappointed. Hu Die appeared in front of her friends with a new attitude. She has largely grasped the personality of Chen Yuanyuan as defined by the playwright, so her performance skills can be said to be quite good. Hu Die's life outside the film industry these years has not been wasted.

All the shots were taken very well, and several close-up shots were appropriately arranged, unlike "Mulan Joins the Army." The progress of the story is harmonious and tense. There is drama, but unfortunately some climaxes do not seem very high. The scenes are relatively grand, but because of capital issues, many scenes could have been grander and more magnificent, but they were not able to be. But in a few places, it is entirely a matter of technique. In my opinion, the grand marching ranks are solemn and magnificent enough. However, the siege of the city is too scattered and does not resemble war. Regarding war scenes, our film industry still does not seem to be at a stage where it can handle them properly.

I don't want to talk about the historical authenticity of this script, but I hope that today's daughters, at least some of them, are all Chen Yuanyuan. The theme of the script is worth treating as a great and solemn lesson. Yes! "The descendants of the Yellow Emperor will never be defeated." The applause of the audience shows that the human heart is not dead. This sentence in "Peerless Beauty" is worth listening to by the masses. I am very excited, I am very happy, I know that the glorious day will come soon.

The descendants of the Yellow Emperor will never be defeated, China has her eternal life!

### The International Fighter on the Screen – Gary Cooper

— Dani

He has played soldiers of six nationalities

Anyone who pays a little attention to movies will never forget that tall, thin man, that young soldier with a mighty face! Indeed, today's Gary Cooper is already familiar and admired by millions of movie fans. Many people think this way (I am one of them): it is easy to find a handsome movie emperor, but it is difficult to find a Gary Cooper. Look: After Clark Gable fell, Clark Gable became popular; Robert Taylor then surpassed Clark Gable, but before long, Tyrone Power suppressed Robert; now Tyrone's popularity is about to pass, and the throne will probably be given to Lee J. Cobb!

However, for more than ten years, there has only been one Gary Cooper in the film industry. Other stars have gone through several ups and downs, but Gary has always been a first-class superstar who is welcomed.

From an age point of view, it is a bit hard to believe that he actually served in the last European war, so his title of "International Fighter" is not accidental.

In fact, he is not only good at playing the role of soldiers, such as "Eighth Wife," isn't "Cowboy and Weaver Girl" an excellent comedy! As for films such as "The Real Glory," "Sergeant York," and "Desire," they are enough to show his heroic and romantic character, so I won't go into details.

Don't you admire him a little now? His new work "Beau Geste" will soon arrive in Shanghai. This is the most famous battle film of the silent film era. Now that Gary is starring in it, it must be even more amazing than before, right?

### Casual Talk about the Entertainment Industry (28) Movies

— Written by Dong Yun, Illustrated by Yan Zhi

After writing an article on "Costume Movies," I haven't talked about "movies" since.

In recent years, domestic film production has made considerable progress, which is a very gratifying thing. Unfortunately, human and material resources are still difficult to compete with imported films for a day's advantage. Magnificent and splendid scenes can only be left for others to excel in.

Crude and shoddy products that cater to the psychology of low-level audiences will inevitably be eliminated after a long time, even if they can obtain temporary huge profits! I hope Chinese film producers will not repeat the same mistakes!
