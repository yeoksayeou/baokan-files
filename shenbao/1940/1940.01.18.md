### Ministry of Economic Affairs Actively Develops Shipping on the Jinsha River; Preparing to Organize a Survey and Navigation Team; Relevant Agencies Send Personnel to Participate

Chongqing: The Jinsha River is the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. Because of its steep slopes, rapid currents, and many dangerous rapids, only the Yibin to Pingshan section of the lower reaches is navigable. The upper reaches have not yet been navigable. In May of last year, the Ministry of Economic Affairs dispatched UN expert Mr. Potter and technician Zhang Jiong to conduct a trial voyage together with Hu Yunzhou, a specialist from the Southwest Transportation Office. Unfortunately, they encountered an accident midway, and the boat capsized, with everyone on board dying in the line of duty. People at home and abroad were deeply saddened.

### French Side Denies Transporting Military Supplies via the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway; Japanese Spread False News with the Obvious Intention of Trying to Disrupt the Railway

Paris: Official circles here have recently issued a statement firmly denying the Japanese claim that military equipment and ammunition are being transported into southern China via the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway. It is said that the Japanese have repeatedly spread such news, which the French side has repeatedly denied, seemingly reflecting the wishes of some people in Japan, especially the military, who hope to justify their air force's bombing of the last railway transportation within Chinese territory not occupied by the Japanese military on military grounds. In fact, most of what is transported on this route are goods from the United States. If the Japanese side repeats this kind of statement and carries out bombing, then the French side will believe that although the Japanese government has a tendency not to want to have more difficult relations with Western countries, its military is acting arbitrarily as if it does not need to respect discipline and the instructions issued to them by the Japanese government and higher authorities.

### Chongqing Newspapers Did Not Publish Wang Jingwei's Telegram to Chiang Kai-shek

Chongqing: This morning, all the Chinese-language newspapers here did not publish the rumored telegram from Wang Jingwei to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek calling for a renewed mandate to negotiate peace with Japan. It has not yet been determined whether the telegram has been sent here. It is recalled that a year ago, Wang sent a telegram from Hong Kong to the Central Committee of the Kuomintang explaining his peace movement. That telegram took 24 hours to reach here, and its original text was only seen when government leaders read newspapers sent by airmail from Hong Kong. The general opinion among the Chinese here is that even if this telegram is sent here, the free areas will probably not publish it. Chairman Chiang's disregard for it can be predicted, and it can be asserted that both the Central Committee of the Kuomintang and the National Government will not consider it. According to a certain Chinese official, the internal situation in Japan is currently unstable. Not to mention Wang's own position in the minds of the Chinese people, even his existence in the minds of the Japanese people has become a big question. Commentators from all walks of life in China believe that it is undoubtedly the case that Wang issued this telegram after first obtaining the approval of Japanese officials. Therefore, although the Japanese side has repeatedly stated that it does not want to directly negotiate with the Chongqing government, it now feels that it is difficult to resolve the Sino-Japanese dispute without directly negotiating with the Chongqing government. The Japanese side clearly wants to use Wang to contact the Chongqing side. Furthermore, in Wang's telegram, he said, "If you reject my proposal, then I will have to begin local peace talks," which shows that Wang has admitted that he does not have the ability to resolve the Sino-Japanese dispute. The general public here is indifferent to this telegram. (Reuters dispatch on the 17th)

### Shops Selling British Goods in Jinan Fined

Beiping: News from the Chinese side in Jinan says that 77 shops in the area that sell British goods have been fined one-quarter of the total value of the British goods because they did not submit the goods for registration.

### How to Stabilize Soaring Prices

The increasingly high prices in Shanghai, according to the latest Shanghai Municipal Council Gazette: the cost of living index for workers in December of last year has increased by 200% compared to the pre-war year of 1936, and by 100% compared to January of last year; the new year is just around the corner, although there are no prepared statistics to fully explain the current state of prices, but there is no sign of prices stopping to rise. Most of the residents of Shanghai today are workers who live on wages, and refugees who are temporarily stranded in Shanghai, how can they maintain their lives under the circumstances of high prices, this has become a major social problem; and now it is already severe winter, hunger and cold are pressing, it is even more serious, just looking at the number of people freezing and starving on the streets and alleys, it is not difficult to imagine the suffering of people struggling on the line of life.

The soaring of Shanghai prices after the war, last year was the most intense. The reasons are complex, most say the violent contraction of foreign exchange, the inflation of currency, Shanghai and the mainland's transportation being cut off, resulting in difficult import of goods, even if imported, it is also because of being exploited and controlled that the cost increases, after import, there are even a few unscrupulous merchants who speculate and manipulate, monopolize and hoard, at the same time also because of the European War that the ship belly decreases, transportation insurance costs increase sharply, the source also has difficulties. Such complex reasons, speakers have their own bases, but in recent months, these reasons, in which have mostly can not become a major reason; in terms of foreign exchange, the stability of China's wartime finance has always been able to maintain the statutory exchange rate of legal currency; even the prices in the black market have recently trended towards loosening. In terms of the amount of legal currency, the national issuance amount as of the end of June last year was only 2.6 billion yuan, which is very different compared to Japan's 4 billion yen at the end of last year, and there is no phenomenon of malignant inflation; taking Shanghai alone, not only is there no feeling of too much currency, but on the contrary, the phenomenon of lack of chips is often found. In terms of import and export transportation. Although not as good as before, but not much different, the source of European and American goods is still continuing uninterrupted. Some also attribute the rise in prices to the National Government's control of export trade, but except for the export commodities stipulated to be sold and settled in foreign exchange, the goods consumed in Shanghai do not need to go through the formalities of foreign exchange settlement. So now the only things that stimulate the continued rise in prices are the daily necessities of life imported into Shanghai, being controlled, levied taxes; and the speculation and manipulation of a few unscrupulous merchants, are the two main reasons. Now the rice, oil, beans, wheat, cotton, firewood, charcoal, lumber, fruits, local goods, vegetables and bricks, tiles, and other items on the Shanghai market are all expensive to the point of doubling, definitely not due to insufficient production, but all due to being controlled; and a few unscrupulous merchants are using this opportunity to collude and do evil, engaging in the pursuit of illicit gains. In addition, the psychology of general industrial and commercial operators is that as long as there are goods in hand, no one is willing to lower the price, which also has a considerable impact.

Recently, many people have put forward the demand for balancing prices in order to solve this serious problem, although the words and arguments are very urgent, but in fact it is difficult to achieve. Balancing prices is a necessary means of a country implementing price policies, so it must completely rely on the power of legal enforcement; but now in Shanghai, the laws of the Chinese government can not be fully enforced, and the surrounding environment has many illegal laws. As for the public community organizations to carry out activities similar to social policy to balance prices, such as group purchasing of rice and selling at fair prices, due to financial and human resources, the effect is there but not grand.

In the real environment, demanding to immediately lower prices, this is really a bit close to luxury; therefore we can only take a step back and think, wishing that the residents of Shanghai can use their own strength to seek rational and possible ways to adapt, in order to temporarily prevent this problem from becoming more serious. First, the residents of Shanghai should live the same hard life as their compatriots in the mainland, and do their best to save; reducing the use of high-priced foreign goods will be able to achieve the effect of stimulating a general price decline. Second, emulate the method of group rice purchases, implement consumer cooperation for the most indispensable necessities, and do their best to avoid manipulation by unscrupulous merchants. Third, the general legitimate industrial and commercial operators should be clean and self-respecting, do not see profit and forget righteousness, and do not help control and exploitation. Fourth, industrial and commercial operators, in the negative aspect, should abandon the psychology of wanting the price of goods to rise, and not be fooled by rumors, to know that the profit of business is not in the increase of prices, but really in the promotion of nutrition. Fifth, industrial and commercial operators, in the positive aspect, this time should also take the opportunity to seek to increase production, reduce costs, and not hinder sales of practical methods, which will be beneficial to both producers and consumers. Sixth, all industries should automatically agree on a price limit, strictly prohibiting free price increases, to harm the people's livelihood. Seventh, the concession authorities, for the sake of social security, should, for all kinds of items related to life, preferably be able to have a strict disposal method like the rice price limit; in order to make the implementation of this disposal method as beneficial as possible, they should temporarily use police power to interfere with all illegal economic activities, which is a relatively most effective method. For example, the food rice problem, since the Municipal Council restricted rice prices and punished illegal rice merchants, rice prices immediately tended to stabilize. Finally, the concession authorities of various countries, for the policy of utilizing strong forces to threaten items related to the life of Chinese and foreign citizens in Shanghai, also seem to should actively protest and strongly oppose. Because this is not only related to the lives of Chinese merchants residing in the concession, but also the rights and interests of various countries in China are equally subject to coercion and damage. The past incident of British and American firms being robbed of eggs is an example. If the above items can be earnestly done, the problem of price oppression leading to panic in life, even if it can not be solved, will inevitably be able to reduce its severity!

### American Rear Admiral Yarnell Advocates a Non-Cooperation Movement Against Japan; Appeals to Fellow Citizens to Find Ways to Prevent Military Supplies from Being Shipped to Japan; Temporarily No Negotiations Before the Expiration of the U.S.-Japan Trade Treaty

New York: After returning to the country, former commander of the U.S. Asian Fleet, Rear Admiral Yarnell, was elected as Honorary Vice Chairman of the "Committee Against Aiding Japanese Aggression." He recently issued an appeal to the American people, urging them to find ways to prevent military supplies from being shipped to Japan and to donate money in order to step up the promotion of the "Non-Cooperation with Japan" movement. He said, "The means by which the Japanese army treats Chinese prisoners of war and non-combatants are extremely barbaric." All economic assistance that could help Japan's aggression against China must be prevented. (Havas dispatch on the 17th)

Washington: There is currently not the slightest sign here of any tension that will occur when the U.S.-Japan Trade Treaty expires on January 26. Reliable sources all expect that no talks will be held before the treaty expires to maintain the status quo. Official circles are handling this matter very calmly. This can be seen from Secretary of State Hull's reply to news reporters' inquiry about the U.S.-Japan discussions today that "there has been no special development this morning." This afternoon, President Roosevelt did not mention this matter when he received news reporters. It seems that the trade treaty matter will be temporarily shelved before it expires, while discussions on the general relationship between the two countries are still ongoing. (Reuters dispatch on the 16th)

Washington: State Department officials claimed here last night that the future of U.S.-Japan commercial relations after January 26 (the date the 1911 U.S.-Japan Trade Treaty expires) will largely depend on how the new Japanese cabinet treats U.S. rights and interests in China and Japan. State Department officials indicated that whether a new trade treaty is signed after the 1911 U.S.-Japan Trade Treaty expires this month will not make much difference to the commercial relations between the two countries. Although France and the United States do not have a trade treaty, the commercial relations between the two countries have been conducted in a friendly manner for many years. If the United States and Japan fall into a treaty-less situation, it will promote Japan to improve its actions in the Far East. Although the United States will not immediately cancel any special rights of Japan or implement punitive measures on Japanese commerce after the 1911 U.S.-Japan Trade Treaty expires, the United States has no obligation to continue to grant Japan indefinite special rights. If Congress feels that Japan's actions require retaliation, the United States may also implement punitive measures against Japan. (United Press dispatch on the 17th)

Washington: Secretary of War Woodring recently said that from July 1 of last year to January 15 of this year, a total of 92,000 people have enlisted in the army, thus the army personnel has been raised to 123,000, which is only 4,000 short of the personnel advocated by President Roosevelt last September. (Havas dispatch on the 17th)

Washington: U.S. Secretary of War Woodring stated to the House Military Affairs Committee today that President Roosevelt plans to allocate 1.7 billion U.S. dollars for defense expenses, but this amount is still insufficient, therefore requesting an increase of 300 million gold dollars. Mr. Woodring advocated that the army should be less in number but more elite, intending to organize an extremely effective army that is not large in number. At present, the U.S. military is scattered in various places and does not have the latest weapons and equipment, and it may be difficult to protect the security of the entire country. Furthermore, protecting the Panama Canal Zone, the Hawaiian Islands, and the Philippine Islands requires 70,000 soldiers, accounting for about one-third of the U.S. standing army. In the event of an emergency, there can only be 120,000 standing troops to protect the U.S. headquarters. According to current estimates, the total number of U.S. troops and guards is only 460,000, but if necessary, it can be increased to 750,000, and the reserve army can be around one million.

### American and Soviet Newspapers Comment on the Japanese Political Situation; The New Cabinet's Main Task is to Seek a Quick End to the War

Moscow: The Soviet trade union newspaper "Labor Newspaper" recently commented on the Japanese cabinet reshuffle, roughly saying that Japanese business people mostly expressed dissatisfaction with the policies promoted by the military. Various political parties also took these people as their backing and fought with the military. It has not been a day or two since this has been the case. Premier Yonai, in the past few years, has been able to maintain neutrality in this struggle. Now that the Abe cabinet has resigned and he has come forward to form a cabinet, it shows that the country still wants to form a cabinet of national unity. The reasons for the collapse of the Abe cabinet are nothing more than the following: First, the war against China has been prolonged; second, economic difficulties have been increasing; and third, major political parties did not come forward to participate in the formation of the cabinet. Now that the Yonai cabinet has been formed, it is expected that the country's parliament will resume at the end of this month, and its main task will be how to end the Sino-Japanese war, thereby resolving the various economic difficulties caused by the war. The country's situation has indeed become increasingly dire. In terms of diplomacy, the country is about to be completely isolated, and its relations with the United States are also becoming increasingly serious. In terms of economy, the country's rice and coal production has decreased, and seafood prices have also risen, and there is a real danger of food shortages. In terms of finance, the country's paper currency issuance has increased daily, while gold reserves have decreased daily, and the situation is extremely serious. (Havas dispatch on the 17th)

Washington: The Washington Post recently published an editorial commenting on the domestic political situation in Japan, roughly saying that "Although the cabinet in the country has been reshuffled, the power of the military has not been weakened. If the Yonai cabinet promotes a policy of appeasement towards Western countries in the future, the military can still sabotage it. Under these circumstances, it is not yet known to what extent Premier Yonai's attempt can be completed." (Havas dispatch on the 16th)

### The New Yonai Cabinet Requests Parliament to Adjourn; Both Houses Exchange Opinions Yesterday, Decide to Reconvene on the 31st of This Month; Takeuchi Kayo to Resign as President of the Planning Board

Tokyo: In the cabinet meetings on the 16th and 17th, the Japanese government focused on countermeasures for parliament. As a result of discussions, regarding the parliamentary term, it was believed that if parliament reconvened on the 22nd as scheduled, the government would not have completed its preparations for various necessary measures. Therefore, it was decided to request both houses to address only the issue of parliamentary adjournment on the 22nd and to take necessary procedures to adjourn until January 30th. Chief Secretary Ishiwatari has already conveyed this intention to the secretaries-general of both the House of Peers, Mr. Raiko, and the House of Representatives, Mr. Daimoku. (17th, Domei News Agency)

Tokyo: Regarding the issue of the reconvening date after the parliamentary adjournment, the House of Representatives specially convened a negotiation meeting of various factions at the Speaker's official residence this afternoon. Based on the government's wishes, it was decided to reconvene on the 22nd, and at that time, a resolution for adjournment would be passed in the House. The House of Peers also plans to hold a negotiation meeting of various factions tomorrow (the 18th) to resolve the adjournment. (17th, Domei News Agency)

Tokyo: On the 16th, Prime Minister Yonai delivered his first statement, expressing his determination to adhere to the established policy of handling the China Incident and to fully support the new central regime in China. The government has scheduled the first meeting of the Asia Development Board after the formation of the new cabinet for the 19th. At that time, Director-General Yanagawa of the Asia Development Board, who returned to Tokyo after attending the liaison conference of the Asia Development Board in Nanjing, will report on the local situation in detail. Then, the future policy of Japan towards the new regime and the method of proclaiming this policy to China and foreign countries will be discussed, and it is scheduled to be announced in some form in the near future. (17th, Domei News Agency)

Tokyo: Prime Minister Yonai entered the Imperial Palace at 1:00 PM today to pay respects to His Majesty the Emperor. He reported that after Chief Prosecutor Kimura was appointed Minister of Justice, Judicial Vice-Minister Iwamura Yozane would succeed him as Chief Prosecutor, and former Deputy Director of the Price Bureau, Takeuchi Kayo, would succeed him as President of the Planning Board. Immediately afterward, the inauguration ceremonies for both individuals were held separately. (17th, Domei News Agency)

Tokyo: The new Finance Minister Sakurai stated to newspaper reporters today that the 1,000,000,000-yen budget proposal will be submitted to the Diet as is. Technically speaking, it would be impossible to complete the revised budget proposal before the Diet reconvenes in early February. (17th, Reuters)

Tokyo: To comply with the government's wishes, various political parties decided today to postpone the opening of the House of Representatives by ten days. The House of Representatives was originally scheduled to reconvene on January 21st after the New Year recess, but it has now been rescheduled to January 30th. However, the plenary session of the House of Representatives will be held on February 1st, at which time the new Prime Minister Yonai and Foreign Minister Arita will both deliver speeches. The budget proposal will be submitted to the House of Representatives on January 31st. The decision of today's meetings of various political parties will be formally ratified by the House of Representatives after the Diet reconvenes. Meetings of various political parties in the House of Peers are scheduled for tomorrow, and the same decision will be made. The government's intention to extend the Diet's recess was communicated to the speakers of both houses after this morning's cabinet meeting, as sufficient time is needed to prepare the budget and other bills.

### An Overview of Tank Warfare Tactics

England invented the tank monster in 1916, originally intending to break the deadlock of trench warfare and determine victory in open terrain. However, outside the infantry trenches, another type of trench emerged, the tank defense trench. The German Siegfried Line and the French Maginot Line were largely designed and created to defend against tanks. Tanks could break through barbed wire obstacles and were impervious to machine gun fire, but they led to the invention of tank defense guns. Building tank defenses required time and materials; constructing one mile of tank defense trench required 5,000 to 12,000 hours of labor. It can be seen that people often create their own problems.

These situations troubled the military authorities of England, France, and Germany. During the last European war, Germany did not imitate and build tanks until the end of the war. In this European war, the situation is the opposite. She has as many as 6,000 tanks, and the number is still increasing. At the beginning of the war, this number was roughly twice that of France. England and the United States had only a few hundred. Furthermore, because of repeated battles in Spain, Austria, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and other countries, Germany had already gained tactics for using new types of tanks.

The terrifying power of this mechanized army was particularly shocking to the world during the Polish War. With lightning speed, they unexpectedly copied the Polish army, with a speed comparable to that of cavalry. It has been proven that the tanks of 1939 are far from comparable to the "flying coffins" of 1918.

The biggest difference is the advance in speed. During the last European war, tanks could only crawl at three or four miles per hour, but now they can reach twenty to twenty-five miles per hour. American tanks can travel at sixty miles per hour on highways. In terms of positional warfare, the effectiveness of tanks is the same as it was when they were first invented in 1916, only in destroying enemy machine gun positions and covering infantry advances, but because of their speed, the effectiveness is different.

The way tanks operate is like this. Suppose the German army finds a weak point in the Maginot Line. Suppose the German army prepares to use a tank army to break through twelve miles of the position on a fifty-mile front, requiring 1,000 tanks. These tanks concentrate in the rear all night. Tank commanders carefully study the enemy's terrain in advance. We will narrow the scope again. The situation in a half-mile battle zone is like this: the tank team attacks at dawn, first bombarding the French artillery positions and tank defense gun positions with artillery; launching smoke bombs at enemy observation posts; the air force covers them from the sky. Countless tanks advance on the rugged terrain, traveling at fifteen miles per hour. When advancing, they must use cover along the way, just like the infantry. This is the first formation, with twenty-five tanks, each separated by fifty yards. These tanks are all medium-sized, each weighing fifteen to twenty tons, and the thickness of the armor is enough to withstand machine gun bullets. One or two of them may be destroyed by tank defense guns. Another one hits a landmine. Another one overturns because of turning too fast. Another one is bombarded by artillery shells. These losses are expected and do not need to be taken to heart. The others that are safe and sound must continue to advance through the artillery fire. After ten minutes, this first tank formation rushes to the rear of the enemy artillery positions, rampaging like mad dogs, firing machine guns at the gunners, and destroying the artillery positions with heavy machine guns.

After a while, the second tank formation also sweeps in, beginning to clear the enemy's tank defense gun positions. Then comes the third formation of light tanks, each weighing six tons, eight tons, and ten tons, with the goal of clearing machine gun positions. They move even faster. In the smoky haze, the infantry also rushes in closely. At the same time, those tanks line up in columns and quickly retreat to their original defense. But they are not retreating in defeat; they are truly retreating to designated positions to hide and repair damage according to a pre-determined plan. Their retreat route is also pre-determined to avoid colliding with the advancing infantry.

After the first offensive, there are three more tank formations heading straight for the enemy's rear second line of defense miles away. This time, however, they do not use artillery but aircraft for cover. The entire line uses 600 bombers and 500 fighter planes, with 90 aircraft over a half-mile front. This time, each tank weighs 20 tons and is equipped with five 37mm machine guns, with six soldiers hidden inside. The tank commander sits in a slightly elevated turret. When he opens the machine gun on the enemy position, he uses to transmit signals to the driver. He has eyes on the telescope and ears wearing wireless headphones. He must often communicate with the aircraft in the sky, the artillery in the rear, and the tanks to the left and right. Tanks are not afraid of machine guns, unless machine gun bullets shoot into the tank's eye. American tests have proven that even if machine gun bullets hit a tank 1,000 times, they will not damage it at all.

What tanks are afraid of is tank defense guns. This type of gun is extremely flexible, the aiming is easiest, and it can fire fifteen rounds per minute during wartime. The shells are one and a half inches in size, with a speed of 1,800 miles per hour. When hitting a tank at a right angle, it can send the tank flying 1,000 yards.

In the repeated wars in Poland, Spain, and Abyssinia, newspapers widely reported that infantry crawling behind tanks and throwing hand grenades and gasoline at them could destroy them. These are all exaggerations.

The main task of aircraft in tank defense warfare is reconnaissance and prevention of attacks. It can bomb attacking tanks or detect tank hiding places, but before the war, the British Air Force spent the whole day without being able to detect tank formations hidden in the forest. Bombing is not easy to hit when tanks are dispersed or moving. During American military exercises, ten old tanks were placed in the grass on the side of the road, as if hiding from aircraft. Nine aircraft flew low and dropped 180 thirty-pound bombs, only destroying one tank.

The Allied forces of Britain and France will definitely find ways to resist this kind of general tank attack and will naturally wait for an opportunity to counterattack. The outcome will determine a part of the fate of this war. (Translated from American *Current History* magazine)

### Undeclared Wars Between China, Japan, Soviet Union, and Finland; American Neutrality Law Not Applicable; President Roosevelt's Statement

Washington: President Roosevelt stated today that the American Neutrality Law does not apply to the Soviet-Finnish conflict, because, up to now, the Soviet-Finnish conflict is still an undeclared war. According to some senators who advocate implementing the Neutrality Law for China, Japan, the Soviet Union, and Finland, after the President's statement, America's attitude has become clearer. (17th, United Press)

Chongqing: A spokesperson for the Chinese government made a statement today in response to the proposal by some members of the U.S. Senate to implement the Neutrality Law for the Soviet-Finnish War and the Sino-Japanese War, stating, "Regarding the Sino-Japanese War, the Chinese government firmly believes that the United States will not change its policy adopted since the outbreak of the war. The reason why the U.S. government has not yet implemented the Neutrality Law for the Sino-Japanese War is that it deeply knows that Japan is the aggressor and China is the victim of aggression. In short, the United States is deeply concerned about the Far East and will never adopt a strict neutral policy of indifference." (17th, United Press)

### Yen Fuqing Appeals to the United States

Chongqing: The Director of the Chinese National Health Administration, Yen Fuqing, delivered a radio address today, appealing to the United States to assist China with medical personnel, supplies, and school equipment. It is said that the United States has so far spent over 200 million U.S. dollars on promoting Chinese health programs and medical education. Yen also mentioned the situation of malaria prevention in Yunnan Province, saying that malaria accounts for 80% of all diseases in the province. This problem is quite similar to what Panama encountered, but Yunnan Province is thirty times larger than the Panama Canal area, and the population is eighty times larger. The Chinese government has now established a malaria prevention committee and plans to have a five-year eradication program and a three-year research program. Yen expressed gratitude for the dispatch of three malaria experts from the U.S. Public Health Service to China to assist, and for the assistance of experts sent by the League of Nations and the International Health Board of the Rockefeller Foundation.

### Chamberlain Reports in the House of Commons; Anglo-Japanese Relations in the Far East; Various Restrictions Within Japanese-Occupied Areas; The Japanese Government Has Taken Steps to Ease Them

London: The House of Commons reconvened this afternoon, and Prime Minister Chamberlain gave a speech, one section of which involved the Far East issue, stating, "The situation in the Far East is still dominated by the hostile actions between China and Japan. There are currently no concrete signs to justify an optimistic prediction for a peaceful resolution in the short term. However, regarding the various restrictions currently in place within the Japanese military occupation areas, which have caused occasional friction and tension in relations between Japan and other countries, the Japanese government has recently taken some actions to ease them, which we welcome."

### British Parliament Reopens; Chamberlain's Speech; Diplomatic and Military Situation; Says Will Seek to Achieve War Aims at Any Cost; Military Aid to Finland Will Not Hinder Domestic Needs

London: The House of Commons reconvened this afternoon, and the chamber was packed. Prime Minister Chamberlain spoke, touching on the diplomatic and military situation. He said, "Germany's intentions towards Belgium and the Netherlands caused anxiety again at the end of last week. We deeply admire the courageous and calm attitude that the governments and people of Belgium and the Netherlands have maintained." Regarding the Finnish issue, he said, "The British government has taken all steps, within the scope of not hindering domestic needs, to allow the export of ordnance needed by the Finnish government to that country. The type and quantity of ordnance, although it is not appropriate to disclose it for the sake of public interest, are extremely abundant." Prime Minister Chamberlain then concluded by stating the close alliance between Britain and France, and describing the various military efforts made by the entire British Empire. All of Germany's propaganda campaigns have had no effect, as evidenced by the fact that the situation in Palestine is more stable than it was a few years ago. What we seek now is a fair and lasting peace, and we hope that it will not be delayed and fruitless for a long time. But we are also determined to achieve victory and will work with all allied countries to achieve it, regardless of the toil and sacrifice. (16th, Havas News Agency)

Hore-Belisha Explains Reasons for Resignation; Defends Democratization of the Army

Former Secretary of War Hore-Belisha attended the House of Commons today, took a seat in the Liberal National Party, and after the members' questioning time ended, stood up amid applause from the members and gave a speech. He first said that he had explained the matter of his resignation in a letter to his constituents and hoped that it would be concluded. He had no other thought except to win the war, which had already been stated in the letter. Regarding the reorganization and development of the army over the past two years, it has progressed in harmony and agreement, which is very different from the waves caused by previous reforms. Moreover, the assistant personnel he invited and recruited were not selected based on obedience and conformity, and most of them had strong personalities. They were often able to speak frankly and directly during meetings, which he deeply admired. Then, Hore-Belisha passionately defended the work of democratizing the army, saying, "Since we are fighting for a democratic system, how can we regard excessive democratization as a disease of the army? As far as I know, regarding any affairs of the War Office, I have never had any disagreement or policy conflict with any cabinet minister. When I performed my duties, I always followed the Prime Minister as a model. The Prime Minister should also acknowledge this. Even until I resigned on the 11th of this month, the Prime Minister did not hesitate to help me at any time." In conclusion, he said that the reason why he respectfully declined the Prime Minister's offer to serve as Minister of Commerce was because he felt that the concept on which the Prime Minister based the cabinet reshuffle made it unlikely that he would be able to serve wholeheartedly to the benefit of the country after taking charge of another department.

Chamberlain Denies Internal Discord; Change of War Minister Does Not Change Policy

After Hore-Belisha finished speaking, Prime Minister Chamberlain spoke next, saying that Hore-Belisha had a strong personality and was popular with public opinion. His resignation naturally attracted special attention from the general public. However, certain rumors and speculations were unfounded and extremely unfair to the influence given to third parties, which was enough to cause misunderstandings, and it was appropriate to refute them. "There was no disagreement on policy between Hore-Belisha and the other cabinet ministers. For this reason, although the War Minister has been replaced, the army policy will not change. This can be said to reassure the House of Commons."

It has been rumored that Hore-Belisha's resignation was related to discord with certain senior military officers. As for who those military officers were, the speakers were vague, saying they were staff members. In fact, there was no such thing. Some people even said that he was under external pressure from certain military officers or their friends to force the replacement of the War Minister, otherwise certain senior military officers in charge of military orders would resign. This statement is the most unfair and malicious, and it is completely fabricated. In short, when we are at war, there is a need for changes in the selection of cabinet members. The Prime Minister considers it the most unpleasant action to change cabinet members, but if the head of state has to announce all the reasons when changing cabinet members, it is impossible to implement the change. (Members of the Government Party applauded; the opposition expressed protest.) For this reason, the reason why I did not explain the reason for reorganizing the cabinet is that I felt that a difficulty had arisen, or it could be said that it was caused by Hore-Belisha's various great abilities. Therefore, it was appropriate to change the War Minister at a certain time, and it was even more appropriate to change him at the same time as other ministers in the cabinet. It is a pity that Hore-Belisha did not agree to take the position of Minister of Commerce. In short, as long as the war continues, and as long as I am in office, I will not use private views as a standard for various matters, but only base them on one standard: whether it is beneficial to winning the war as soon as possible. (Members cheered.) (16th, Havas News Agency)

### Labour and Liberal Parties Raise Questions; Stanley is Unpopular

Labour Party leader Attlee began by saying that it would be ungracious to deny the significant reforms made by Hore-Belisha during his tenure. However, it would be absurd to say that the various reforms were made by Hore-Belisha alone, as some newspapers have said. Of course, there are military personnel who understand the necessity of improving everything to meet the needs of the times. He thought that in the midst of various innovations, Hore-Belisha must have obtained the cooperation of many prominent military personnel. However, Hore-Belisha's words contained an implication that his new policies based on the democratization of the army were not welcomed by some parties, so he could not stay in his position for long. The Labour Party is not happy with Stanley's change from Minister of Commerce to War Minister. The Labour Party wants to have a strong and capable person to take this seat. He hopes that Stanley will continue to proceed along the lines of the new policies and reform the organization of the War Office. There are other changes in the cabinet that are welcomed by the people of the country, but the change of the War Minister alone is regarded as an unusual event. The organization of the War Cabinet is not on an appropriate basis and should not be organized by ministers with heavy duties.

Liberal Party leader Sinclair continued to speak, saying that the Liberal Party has always been a critic of Hore-Belisha, but now that he has resigned, it is fair to acknowledge his achievements during his tenure. However, it would be a big mistake to say that the credit for innovation belongs only to Hore-Belisha, because the new policies did not originate solely from Hore-Belisha's mind and aspirations. The new policies represent the public opinion expressed by Parliament, and Hore-Belisha is only an instrument of public opinion.

Labour Party Wedgwood asked the Prime Minister to respond to the rumours that Hore-Belisha's resignation was caused by opposition to his being Jewish. Chamberlain replied that this kind of rumour was hardly worth denying, but he was willing to absolutely deny it. (16th, Reuters)

### France Drawn into War: Dominated by British Influence; Berlin Government Responds to French Yellow Book, Accuses France of Violating Franco-German Paris Declaration

Berlin - The German government last night issued its first formal response to the French Yellow Book, titled "France Violates the Franco-German Declaration of December 6, 1938." It included records of talks between German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and French Foreign Minister Bonnet in Paris in December 1938, attended by Schmidt, a translator with the rank of minister from the German Foreign Office, proving that: (1) Germany had notified the responsible French leaders about all issues concerning Eastern Europe; (2) After the Munich Agreement, especially the Franco-German Declaration of December 6, 1938, France had completely acknowledged Germany's stance as the basis of its foreign policy. The French Yellow Book failed to acknowledge these two facts, its intention being to conceal France's promise not to interfere in Eastern European affairs. Regarding this point, the German official document pointed out the following three things: (1) At a meeting of the French Radical Socialist Party in Marseille in October 1938, Senator Basso presented a foreign policy report, the gist of which was that France must reconsider its alliance system after the Czech incident, and that if it did not act as an "international gendarmerie" but saw itself as a Western naval power and an empire with colonies, France would not lose its position as a first-class power. This report was unanimously adopted by the Radical Socialist Party Congress and established as the basis of France's new foreign policy. (2) French Prime Minister Daladier also delivered a speech at the party congress in Marseille on October 27, 1938, expressing full acceptance of Basso's proposed foreign policy of "self-restraint." (3) On November 28, 1938, the French Foreign Ministry's official newspaper, "Le Temps," also published an official article discussing Eastern European issues, strongly arguing that they were not related to Western European security.

Under the above three facts, the Franco-German Declaration was signed in Paris on December 6, 1938. During the talks at that time, Schmidt, the German Foreign Office translator, served as an interpreter between the French and German foreign ministers and made the following important records: (1) German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop clearly indicated to French Foreign Minister Bonnet that France's mutual assistance treaties with Czechoslovakia and Poland were remnants of the Treaty of Versailles and could no longer be allowed to exist. Bonnet replied, "Since Munich, the situation has fundamentally changed." (2) When the German Foreign Minister declared Czechoslovakia to be within Germany's "sphere of interest," the French Foreign Minister did not object. (3) Due to domestic sentiment, French Foreign Minister Bonnet delivered a speech in the Chamber of Deputies on January 26, 1939, forcefully stating that France had a "vital" interest in Eastern Europe and that the Franco-Polish mutual assistance pact was fully effective. This contradicted the above two points. However, Bonnet still felt bound by the guarantee of the Franco-German Declaration of December 6, 1938, that is, the promise not to interfere in Eastern European affairs. This can be seen in two reports from the German Ambassador to France, Welczeck: (A) When Bonnet received Welczeck, he declared, "My desire to promote Franco-German relations comes from the heart. I believe that the Franco-German Declaration is not a meaningless diplomatic document but a starting point for improving Franco-German relations. I hope to visit Berlin soon to return the visit, and finally declare that the speeches made in the Chamber of Deputies were mostly for domestic consumption." (B) The second report stated that Welczeck was ordered to visit Bonnet and express Germany's surprise at Bonnet's speech in the Chamber of Deputies. Bonnet replied that the foreign policy pronouncements in the Chamber of Deputies were mostly for domestic consumption and had no other significance. Finally, the official report published the response made by the French Ambassador to Germany, Coulondre, to the German Foreign Minister, saying that "it is difficult for France to disregard Eastern European affairs, but in any case, France will never adopt a policy of disturbing Germany." From this perspective, from December 1938 to February 1939, France had received complete notification of Germany's demands in Eastern Europe and had also acknowledged and guaranteed not to oppose these demands. The reason for violating the promise and being drawn into the war was due to the dominance of British influence. (Haitong Telegram, 17th)

Berlin - The panic caused by the recent defensive measures taken by the Netherlands and Belgium has not yet caused a reaction from German people and newspapers. In addition to publishing news of the Netherlands and Belgium soliciting opinions from the governments of the United Kingdom and France, there are no comments published. Therefore, the newspapers did not mention the alarming news that came from the United States that Germany would advance into the Netherlands and Belgium. Berlin political figures believe that these rumors are all caused by the paranoia of the United Kingdom and France. (Haitong Telegram, 17th)

Copenhagen - A guest came from the Westphalia province of Germany and said that German troops in the area were frequently mobilized, so there were many delays along the way.

One route is preparing to attack the rear of the Dutch army to the north, and the other route is preparing to attack Belgium from the southwest. The rumor that German mechanized troops have been concentrated near Limburg, Netherlands, is now clearly confirmed. (Havas, 16th)

### Italy and Hungary: Maintain Friendship; Avoid Being Drawn into the Vortex of War; The Two Sides Have the Same Views

Budapest - Prime Minister Teleki delivered a speech at a special meeting of the government party here today, substituting for Foreign Minister Csáky, who was unable to speak due to illness. The Hungarian Prime Minister declared that both Italy and Hungary maintain friendly relations with Germany and are on friendly terms with other European countries, including the Allied countries. Therefore, Italian-Hungarian relations are very close. Italy has always adopted a friendly attitude towards Hungary, so consultations between the foreign ministers of the two countries on international issues are normal events. Italy and Hungary have the same international status and both avoid being drawn into the vortex of war. They also adopt the same goals for economic agreements and raw material issues. This same view has been reflected in the Venice talks. (Haitong Telegram, 17th)

### American House of Representatives Continues to Discuss: Naval Expansion Plan; Navy Department Advocates Adding 77 New Ships; Atlantic Fleet Will Practice Cruising; American Army Requests Enrichment of Weapons

Washington - The House Naval Affairs Committee continued to discuss the naval expansion plan today. Admiral Stark, Chief of Naval Operations, again supplemented his explanation, saying that Congress had previously approved the construction of 68 warships, of which 19 were started in July last year. This resolution of the naval expansion plan also advocates adding 77 warships of various types and a batch of naval aircraft. To complete these 145 warships and this aircraft, the government will need an additional $2.276 billion by 1945. Some say that the government should first complete the 68 warships that were previously approved for construction and then ask Congress to approve the construction program of 77 ships. It is not known that when the government requested the construction of the above 68 warships, the European War had not yet broken out, so there was no need to rush. At this time, we have received various information sufficient to prove that other countries are stepping up shipbuilding, so the United States must catch up quickly. (Havas, 16th)

Washington - Secretary of the Navy Edison recently announced that 22 warships belonging to the United States Atlantic Fleet are scheduled to depart from Guantanamo Naval Base (a US leased territory) in Cuba within a short period of time and practice patrolling in the Caribbean Sea.

The Finnish Air Force flew out several times yesterday to reconnoiter and bomb the Soviet army, and shot down four Soviet aircraft on Sunday. (Reuters, 17th)

Moscow - Regarding the awarding of medals to officers and soldiers of the Soviet Red Army for their achievements in fighting in Finland, the Pravda commented, "Brave Soviet soldiers are fighting under the victorious banner of the Red Army to liberate Finland, which is oppressed by the Mannerheim party, and to protect our northwestern border. When the Soviet people read the list of these brave soldiers, they will express admiration and cherish them.

The strength of the Red Army is greatly linked to the people. We cherish the Red Army, and we spare no effort to strengthen the Red Army. In our country, the front and rear are united as one, and their solidarity is like steel. Every fighter fighting in Finland constantly feels the assistance given to them by the country, as well as the love and concern of the entire public. The petty capitalist and corrupt writers of foreign newspapers may arbitrarily fabricate news of the Red Army's 'defeat', but they still cannot obliterate the heroic facts of the Soviet army. The unfounded lies manufactured by these corrupt foreign writers have been broken by the fact that the Red Army has been awarded medals. The Red Army is an army that liberates the working masses, and every soldier fighting in Finland can understand their honorable international mission. (TASS, 16th)

### Chao Shan Japanese Troops Feign Attack on Jiefeng to Contain Northern Guangdong; Fierce Battles Occurred on the 2nd and 3rd, All Were Surrounded and Severely Attacked by Chinese Troops

Shantou Correspondence: While the Guangzhou Japanese troops were eyeing Shaoguan, the Japanese troops in Chao Shan, taking advantage of the tense situation in the upper reaches of the Dong River, also deployed troops and generals to attack the west of the Chao Shan Railway, feigning an attack on Jieyang and Fengshun. On the morning of the 2nd, more than 500 Japanese cavalry and artillery, under the cover of three tanks, set out from the southwest gate of Chao'an, crossed Chi Hu, and went straight to the Qing Mao Mountain position of the Chinese army on the Anjie Road. After four hours of fierce fighting, three Japanese planes flew to Qu Xi and other places in Jieyang to drop bombs to prevent reinforcements from the Chinese army. The battle lasted until 1:00 PM, when the Japanese troops were defeated and retreated. The Chinese troops pursued them to Feng Xi, where they discovered more than 100 Japanese corpses and seized dozens of machine guns and rifles. Previously, the people of various villages and townships fled into the mountains when they heard that the Japanese troops were coming. Since training, when the Japanese troops arrive, all the able-bodied men in the village lie in the fields to cooperate in the battle. The reason why the Chinese army can repeatedly defeat the many with the few is based on this. On the evening of the 2nd, the Chinese army's Huang Lian, taking advantage of the victory, attacked the Japanese strongholds in Yunbu City and Chi Hu. The Japanese troops stubbornly resisted with dense night artillery fire, bombarding all night. At dawn, the Chinese army safely retreated. On the morning of the 3rd, more than 100 members of the Chinese guerrillas rushed into Fuyang City, launching street battles and burning several Japanese puppet agencies and warehouses. The Dehua troops of the Chao'an Japanese army dispatched more than 1,000 soldiers with six tanks to rush to Wuyang, Fuyang, Xitang, and Fengxi for support. The Chinese army also divided its forces to meet them. The fierce battle lasted until night. More than 200 Japanese troops were killed or wounded in Wuyang, and the Japanese troops in Fengxi were also surrounded and severely attacked. Some released poison gas bombs and desperately tried to break through. The Chinese side burned rice straw and used the smoke from the straw stalks to evaporate the poison gas, finally defeating the Japanese troops. A Japanese captain, the commanding officer, was killed. Their plan to contain the situation ultimately failed.

### Martial Law in Suzhou Urban Area; Curfew Hours Specified; Checks at Key Transportation Points

Suzhou Correspondence: Since the assassination of Yang Shoutong, the puppet magistrate of Wuxi, all the puppet officials in this county felt uneasy because it borders on Wuxi. Therefore, the puppet provincial police bureau and the Japanese troops stationed in Suzhou jointly announced martial law starting from the 10th and stipulated that the curfew hours would be from 11:00 PM to 5:00 AM the next morning. The Japanese and puppets have been checking pedestrians at key transportation points for days, and even women and children cannot avoid it. Therefore, the Banmen Main Street and Guanqian Street area, which used to be bustling, has recently become quiet again.

The number of Japanese troops stationed in this county is decreasing day by day, and the situation is the same in neighboring counties. At the same time, the Japanese troops wanted to maintain the traffic on the Jinghu Line, so they instructed the puppet police department to convene a police affairs meeting. It was presided over by Yuan, the director of the puppet police department. As a result, the proposal failed because the Japanese side did not allocate firearms and ammunition.

### Cantonese Chinese Army Recovers Dongguan; Southern Section of Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway Completely Cleared

Hong Kong Correspondence: The Chinese army in northern Guangdong won a great victory, and the elite of the Japanese army was almost completely wiped out. The Japanese commander, Ando Rikichi, urgently telegraphed Nishio for help and shortened the defensive line around Guangzhou, concentrating his forces to defend the areas near the suburbs. Nantou Shenzhen in Bao'an, Daliang, Rongqi, and Guizhou in Shunde were successively recovered by the Chinese army. However, in order to consolidate transportation on the Humen waterway, the Japanese army deployed heavy troops and built strong defensive lines and fortifications on the highways from Dongguan to Zhangmutou, Dongguan to Shilong, and Dongguan to Taiping. Unexpectedly, since the 5th, the Japanese troops in Dongguan suddenly and quietly withdrew, using 20 military vehicles to transport goods to Taiping to board ships, making more than a dozen trips. All the gold, silver, and valuables were transported away, leaving only 200 puppet troops to protect the Dongguan-Zhangmutou highway as a cover, which was no different from when the Japanese troops retreated from Nantou. When Xiang Hanping of the Chinese army received the report, he immediately ordered Wang Ruozhou, the commander of the Third Military Region, and Zhang Yu, the head of the security regiment, to send troops to recover it. At 3:00 PM on the 5th, they engaged in a fierce battle with the puppet troops at Huangqi Mountain. The puppet troops were defeated and returned to Dongguan City, looting wildly. The Chinese army took the opportunity to enter through the west gate, searching the city. The puppet troops were preparing to flee far away. While they were packing their loot in several hundred bundles in a chaotic manner, the four city gates were surrounded by the Chinese army. More than 130 puppet troops were captured on the spot. The street battle lasted until 11:00 PM, when the Chinese army officially recovered Dongguan City.

When the Japanese troops withdrew from Nantou, they left behind the puppet "Peace and National Salvation Army" Peng Ziming Special Service Battalion and the "Puppet Pacification Army" Zheng Shuijin Battalion, totaling about 200 people. They were originally bandits, so they entrenched themselves in Chikan Dananshan. Some also took boats to nearby small islands, returning to a life of piracy. On the 7th, Ruan, the captain of the Nantou guerrilla detachment, entered and stationed in the Chenwu Shekou area, encircling and suppressing the puppet troops in Chikan. The puppet troops dispersed and fled to Huangtian and Huangyong, two villages in the middle section of Baoda Road. Captain Ruan pursued them to Xixiang. The puppet troops were panicked, and on the 8th, they wrote to Zheng Bing, the head of the First District, expressing their willingness to repent and surrender. It is said that Xiang Hanping has already agreed and sent people to reorganize them and transfer them to the rear for training.

After the recovery of Shenzhen, the traffic between Hong Kong and Dongjiang became more convenient. People from Hong Kong inspecting the mainland came and went every day. The rails and sleepers of the railway from Shenzhen to Shilong were mostly dug up and destroyed. The farmland in Jitian Village, not far from the British border of Lok Ma Chau, was leveled by the Japanese troops to be used as an airfield, 2,500 feet long and 300 feet wide, with three red brick houses as targets for aircraft landing. The airfield was not destroyed. According to the villagers, the rails were dismantled by the Japanese troops for military use, while the sleepers were stolen by the villagers to be used as firewood. The section from Zhangmu to Shilong, even the roadbed, was dug up and destroyed, unrecognizable, desolate, and completely lost the appearance of a railway.

### President Chiang's Telegram to Elementary School Principals, Teachers, and Staff Nationwide (Original Text): Elementary School Teachers Devote Themselves to Education; Their Contributions Benefit the Nation; Provinces Should Raise Educational Funds; Society Must Respect Teachers

President Chiang's telegram issued to elementary school principals, teachers, staff, and people from all walks of life nationwide on the 16th was already recorded in yesterday's telecommunications column of this newspaper. The original text is recorded as follows: "To elementary school principals, teachers, staff, and people from all walks of life across the country: Education is the foundation of national salvation, and elementary school education, which cultivates children, is the foundation of national salvation education. If all children across the country can receive excellent education to mold them and create sound and firm national personalities, then using them to build the country, everyone can fulfill their duties and complete all major construction projects; using them to defend the country, everyone can be brave in the face of difficulties and become strong and healthy soldiers. After the Franco-Prussian War in 1870, Germany won, and its commander, Moltke, attributed the victory to the elementary school teachers of the whole country. This was widely circulated and hailed as an accurate assessment. In the past ten years, the number of schools and students in our country's elementary school education has been increasing day by day. Elementary school teachers in various places have mostly been loyal to their duties and have used their spare time to engage in social education, inspiring the spirit of national revival with the spirit of the Three Principles of the People. This kind of potential power is entrusted by the nation. Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the hard work of teaching in the past has shown its clear effect. The vigorous development of national concepts and ethnic consciousness among our compatriots is not only far better than during the Sino-Japanese War of 1894 but also cannot be compared with the situation at the time of the September 18th Incident. The strong and young take up arms as pioneers, and the old and weak work hard to repay the country. Some children in the war zones can even automatically organize themselves, endure hardships, and avoid danger to participate in the work of the War of Resistance. The spirit of common hatred for the enemy fills the hearts and minds of 450 million compatriots, enabling them to fight for three years, becoming stronger and stronger, achieving the effect of overcoming matter with spirit, and determining the situation where victory will definitely be achieved. This kind of progress is due to the awakening of the people, but the greatest part of creating it depends on the continuous efforts of elementary school teachers across the country. My dear elementary school teachers, you have made great and sacred contributions to the nation and the country, and you have glorious and immortal achievements. In addition, elementary schools in various places mostly have insufficient funding, and teachers' salaries are very meager. However, teachers can persevere, be poor but still determined, and persevere in their aspirations amidst difficult lives. Dr. Sun Yat-sen said that the purpose of life is to serve. You are the best models. Therefore, all our compatriots across the country, whether for public or private reasons, and to praise the morality of service, should pay their respects and sincere gratitude to the current elementary school teachers. My dear elementary school teachers, you are worthy of this. I have always admired you, and I deeply believe that your greatness in devoting yourselves to the country in schools and classrooms is no less than that of the officers and soldiers fighting on the battlefield. I believe that the education sector should be the pioneer in the great cause of national construction, and the realization of the Three Principles of the People and the completion of grassroots construction must rely on elementary school teachers to exert their enthusiasm, dedicate their talents, spread to the countryside, bury themselves in hard work, and make extensive and long-term efforts to have the hope of success. Therefore, when I personally drafted the outlines of county-level organizations last year, I resolutely adopted the three-in-one system in the grassroots organizations from townships and towns to baojia, and stipulated that the positions of township head and town head, central elementary school principal, strongman squad leader at the township level, and bao leader, national school principal, and bao strongman squad leader at the bao level should be held concurrently by one person. The implementation of economic, security, cultural, and health construction projects in townships and towns is also the responsibility of elementary school teachers. All missions to organize and train the people and implement autonomy are completely centered on elementary schools, that is, completely entrusted to you. Therefore, your task from now on is not only to be teachers and guardians who cultivate healthy modern children but also to advance to become the backbone of national construction and the mentors of the entire people. The difficulty of your responsibilities has increased tenfold compared to the past, and the country's expectations of you are a hundred times greater than before. As for the low salaries and difficult lives of teachers, especially since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the soaring prices have made the situation even more difficult. I am always deeply concerned about this. The government has an unshirkable responsibility to improve this as soon as possible. I have already personally ordered the authorities in various provinces to earnestly plan and make the greatest possible effort according to local conditions to provide overall solutions and provide remedies as soon as possible. Even private elementary schools, if they are qualified, should be treated equally and provided with assistance. All places where the county-level organization outlines are implemented should provide special funds for elementary school expenses and teachers' salaries to ensure that they are balanced with the tasks they undertake and can maintain a living. It is hoped that my dear teachers will understand the hardships of the country and society during the War of Resistance and recognize that education is a noble service. They should strive to work hard and continue to work hard to educate the people and save the country. They should not be shaken in their goals by temporary poverty, nor should they abandon their duties because of the lack of recognition of their achievements. Once the War of Resistance is won, the central government will definitely seek more practical and reasonable improvements in the guarantee of your lives. At the same time, I hope that people from all walks of life in various places will not only appreciate the merits of elementary school teachers to the country and their own children but also recognize that safeguarding education is a shared responsibility of everyone. They should especially respect elementary school teachers and pay tribute to their difficult circumstances. They should work hard separately in their respective places, either by transferring public funds to increase educational expenses or by generously donating to improve school fees. They should use the same enthusiasm as they treat anti-Japanese soldiers to ensure the stability of the necessary lives of our elementary school teachers so that they can concentrate on teaching and not be troubled by hunger and cold. Then, a little more will make a lot, and everyone will be able to lift it easily. Directly benefiting their own children and indirectly benefiting the country's long-term plan of cultivating talents. With this sincere intention, I hope that my dear elementary school teachers and people from all walks of life will deeply understand and encourage each other. Chiang Kai-shek, January 16, Yu, Chongqing."

As for Rear Admiral Glassford, it is a routine tour of the Yangtze River defense. Even if the American Ambassador did not plan to go, Rear Admiral Glassford would still make the trip to Hankou. The American warship "Luzon" will replace the "Guam" in Hankou, which will leave. The gunboat "Oahu" will accompany the "Luzon" to Hankou for protection. After the "Guam" leaves Hankou, it will come to Shanghai to moor, along with the "Tulsa." There will then be two large American gunboats in Shanghai.

Trip to Chongqing Next Month

After returning to Shanghai on February 6th, the American Ambassador will still stay at the Cathay Hotel, where he will take care of personal matters before taking a ship to Hong Kong to fly to Chongqing to meet with the central authorities and make a report. The presence of the Ambassador in Chongqing will add to the already lively atmosphere amongst the various foreign diplomatic envoys stationed there. The current Ambassadors in Chongqing include French Ambassador Cosme, British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, and the Swedish and Soviet Ambassadors, Pan Youxin, and others.

No Meeting with Kato

It is reported that the American Ambassador arrived in Shanghai via Hong Kong from Chongqing on the evening of November 22nd last year on the President Coolidge. He met with American Consul General Gauss in Shanghai and Admiral Hepburn, Commander of the US Asiatic Fleet, on the flagship Augusta, for important discussions on the general situation between the US, Japan, and the Far East. He then left Shanghai on the evening of the 23rd on the Kailin Steamship Company's "Kaiping" bound for Qinhuangdao, transferred to Tianjin, and then to Beiping to meet with his family and celebrate his daughter Jenny's fourth birthday. The Ambassador made a trip to Tianjin on December 15th to meet with the local American Consul and listen to reports on business conditions from them and the American community in North China. At that time, the Japanese special envoy was supposed to meet with Kato to discuss US-Japan issues, but the Ambassador quietly left without meeting with Kato.

### Redemption and Payment of Principal and Interest on the 25th Year of the Republic Unified, Reconstruction, and Long-Term Financial Bonds; Nearly 70 Million Yuan; Payment Methods to Be Announced

Regarding the principal and interest of the 25th Year of the Republic Unified Bonds, the 25th Year of the Republic Reconstruction Bonds, and the 17th Year of the Republic Long-Term Financial Bonds, which were guaranteed by customs revenue, after the Ministry of Finance declared that it was forced to suspend payments due to the interception of customs revenue, the Central, Communications, Agricultural, and Bank of China are permitting redemption and payment of maturing principal and interest to maintain credit. (1) The eighth installment of principal and interest on the Unified Bonds, totaling 56,476,600 yuan, will be paid starting January 31st. (2) The eighth installment of principal and interest on the Reconstruction Bonds, totaling 11,543,000 yuan, will be paid starting January 29th. (3) The twenty-third installment of principal and interest on the Long-Term Financial Bonds, totaling 1,518,750 yuan, will be paid starting March 31st. The total principal and interest to be repaid for the above three types is 69,538,350 yuan. The redemption and payment methods will be announced by the head offices of the four banks.

### Domestic Sales of Shanghai Factory Products

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce telegraphed to inquire about reports that the Ministry of Economic Affairs was considering prohibiting the domestic sale of manufactured goods from the Shanghai concessions. Yesterday, Zhu Wenqi and Fang Yixian, along with eight other members of the National Goods Review Committee, also jointly telegraphed the Ministry of Economic Affairs. Minister Weng of the Ministry of Economic Affairs in Chongqing is respectfully informed that Shanghai concession Chinese-owned factories are of utmost importance to the livelihood of the rear areas and the country's wartime resources. The sources of raw materials for the various products sold in the interior have all been meticulously stipulated by your ministry and verified and certified by the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, with clear distinctions and no room for confusion. Unexpectedly, according to Shanghai newspapers, there is news that your ministry has issued a clear order absolutely prohibiting the domestic sale of products from Shanghai concession Chinese-owned factories. If this is true, we believe it is unacceptable. We who have remained in Shanghai since the war have more direct observations and dare to submit this telegram to seek instructions. We respectfully request adoption.

### Eight Hundred Isolated Soldiers Learn Handicrafts; Commander Xie Refuses Donations

According to reports, the Eight Hundred Isolated Soldiers, in order to be self-sufficient and reduce the government's burden, have begun to establish industrial production. The estimated budget for this plan is 6,000 yuan in national currency for start-up costs. The current funds received are only 3,500 yuan, leaving a shortfall of 2,500 yuan. It is reported that the person in charge of the Isolated Soldiers has sent a letter to the Zhenlian Association in Hong Kong, requesting them to find a way to raise funds from Chinese community groups in Hong Kong in order to complete the plan. According to the commander of the Isolated Soldiers, Xie Jinyuan, the above news is not entirely accurate. The idea of establishing industry dates back to the summer of the 27th year. I had this proposal, but unfortunately, the people entrusted with it were not experts, which caused delays. Last autumn, I again sought someone to do it, but after some contact, it stopped again. After repeated attempts, starting last November, we first established four groups: sock weaving, soap making, rattan weaving, and carpentry. For the past two months, the results have been very impressive. We plan to continue to establish leather, auto repair, driving, radio, straw weaving, towel, and toothpaste groups. One reason is the limited space, and the other is that the economic budget has not yet been compiled. However, the purpose of establishing industry is for learning, so once the learning is proficient, we will rotate and exchange each other. It is expected that each person will be able to learn two to three skills within a year, and in the future, they can be responsible for guiding others. The budget requiring 6,000 yuan and the current 3,500 yuan are not accurate figures. There is also no such thing as sending a letter to Hong Kong to raise funds. However, it is true that news media colleagues from Hong Kong and Thailand have told me that they will call for donations on our behalf, but I have politely declined because the funds needed are not much. Given past experiences, I have decided to refuse outside donations from the beginning and will never ask anyone for donations. However, if public and private groups voluntarily donate directly to the Shanghai Garrison Headquarters, I will personally issue receipts and publicly acknowledge them on a regular basis. Apart from this, I make this special statement.

### New Subsidiary Currency to Be Transported to Shanghai; Severe Shortage of Subsidiary Currency Notes in the Market; Limited Amount of New Subsidiary Currency Exchangeable

Although the Shanghai market has been replenished with new subsidiary currency notes by the Ministry of Finance, there is still a shortage. Businesses are often unwilling to give change in small denomination notes for transactions under 50 cents, requiring customers to increase their purchases. This has invisibly increased the cost of living for citizens, so further replenishment is still extremely necessary. Now, according to the decision of the Supreme National Defense Council, the Ministry of Finance has implemented the issuance of new subsidiary currency starting from January 1st of this year to meet the needs of various regions across the country. The new currency has already been fully circulated in the southwestern, northwestern, and western provinces. In Shanghai, the currency will be issued and circulated in the market by the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank of China as soon as the new currency arrives. The types of new currency include 10-cent, 5-cent, 2-cent, and 1-cent denominations. The new subsidiary currency regulations stipulate the exchange limits for various industries. It is reported that the Central Bank plans to follow the regulations set by the Ministry when issuing the currency. Furthermore, the fractional currency notes continuously issued by the Central Bank, regardless of whether they were issued before or after the new subsidiary currency, will still be supplied to the market in sufficient quantities.

### Soliciting Donations for Price Stabilization; 1 Million Yuan Target Still Short 500,000 Yuan; First Batch of Group Orders of Rice Begins Delivery

The Shanghai Price Stabilization Committee, entrusted the Rice Dealers Association to handle the price stabilization. 100 rice shops have been designated within the two concessions to handle the procedures, which will soon be completed. Price stabilization is scheduled to begin on the 21st, with each shop limited to selling 50 bags of rice per day. The 16,000 bags of foreign rice ordered from Saigon have been loaded onto ships and are expected to arrive in Shanghai before the end of January. The committee has decided that after the 30,000 bags of rice purchased in Shanghai are sold out, they will continue to stabilize prices with the rice ordered from Saigon without interruption. Regarding the rice shops for price stabilization that were previously announced, the following changes have been made: The rice shop for number 31, originally Wansheng, is now changed to Xin Changsheng on Kangti Road; the ticket seller for number 50, originally Yusheng, is now changed to Yuanyuan on Ximen Road; the rice shop, originally Wanhe, is now changed to Wanruitai on Ximen Road.

Group Orders of Rice; Advances for Delivery

After the Shanghai Citizens' Food Regulation Association arranged for citizens to order foreign rice in groups, various organizations, agencies, factories, and firms enthusiastically entrusted the association to order foreign rice on their behalf. The amount of down payments received has reached 240,000 yuan (equivalent to approximately 12,000 bags of rice). After the first batch of 600 tons of foreign rice ordered from Saigon by the association arrived in Shanghai, it was temporarily stored in the Kin城Bank warehouse. An agreement has been reached with Kin城Bank to advance funds at a cost of 43.83 yuan per bag, excluding the 20 yuan down payment. The amount to be advanced is 142,980 yuan, and all procedures have been completed. It is reported that deliveries have begun. The association has decided that the second batch of group orders will also be 600 tons (approximately 6,000 bags) and the purchasing committee will soon telegraph to Saigon to place the order.

Rice Industry Groups Suggest Measures

The Shanghai Bean and Rice Trade Association, the Rice Shop Association, and the Miscellaneous Grains, Oilcake Trade Association, and other three groups, yesterday communicated with the two price stabilization committees: "Respectfully, since the outbreak of food panic in Shanghai, the rescue measures have consisted of holding price stabilization sales and group purchases of rice. This is what our associations have repeatedly advocated and what people from all walks of life have commonly approved. Holding price stabilization sales at this time of severe winter is indeed the most urgent task and should be further promoted with all efforts, expanding the solicitation of donations. There are still quite a few industry groups that have not yet pledged their contributions, and all groups should be asked to show sympathy and contribute generously to achieve lasting results. This is the first point. The fundraising is to prepare for the losses of price stabilization, and the borrowing and advancing of funds from the financial community are indispensable for taking delivery of the bill of lading upon the arrival of foreign rice in Shanghai. Otherwise, it will be difficult to turn over funds if the price stabilization funds are not received, and there is a risk of interruption. We should ask the financial community to lend enthusiastic support to facilitate turnover. This is the second point. In addition, the group purchase of rice should continue because although the rice market is still stable, the future is long and the worries have not ended. It is necessary to take a two-pronged approach and make unremitting efforts so that Shanghai's grain reserves can be increased, saving both ourselves and others and achieving effective results. We should urge all groups to work together and register with the Citizens' Food Regulation Association to continue ordering rice. This is the third point. Taking advantage of your committee's convening of a plenary meeting, we respectfully submit this letter and sincerely hope that you will adopt our suggestions. We will be extremely grateful."

Meeting Today to Solicit Donations

After the Price Stabilization Committee issued an announcement to solicit donations for price stabilization, it tentatively set the donation target at 1 million yuan in national currency. Various industries have already pledged 500,000 yuan in national currency, and all payments have been made to the designated banks and money shops. In addition to arranging for price stabilization to begin on the 21st of this month, the committee is scheduled to hold its third plenary meeting at the Maritime Club on Guangdong Road at 3 p.m. today to continue promoting fundraising efforts.

### This Newspaper's Deputy Editor-in-Chief, Zhang Yunhe, Passed Away Yesterday; Funeral Scheduled for 2 p.m. Tomorrow

Mr. Zhang Yunhe of Songjiang, deputy editor-in-chief of this newspaper, served the newspaper for 37 years. His scholarship and integrity were highly regarded. Recently, he fell ill due to overwork and a weakened body. However, his concern for national affairs and his dedication to newspaper affairs remained unchanged for decades. Unfortunately, Mr. Zhang passed away yesterday morning due to pneumonia. The colleagues of this newspaper deeply mourn the loss of a model figure.

Passed Away Yesterday Morning

Since January five years ago, after suffering a cerebral hemorrhage due to overwork, colleagues advised him to rest more. However, Mr. Zhang always remained concerned about newspaper affairs and never relieved himself. In recent years, his physical condition deteriorated, and two months ago, he developed a cough. After consulting a doctor, it was diagnosed as pneumonia. His sons personally attended to him day and night, preparing medicine, hoping for his early recovery. In the end, his spirit declined due to decades of mental and physical exhaustion, coupled with limited appetite. Unfortunately, he passed away at 4:50 a.m. yesterday (the 17th).

Funeral Tomorrow

Mr. Zhang's body has been moved to the White Palace Funeral Home on Xida西 Road, Jing'an Temple Road. The funeral is scheduled for 2 p.m. tomorrow (the 19th). At that time, friends from all sides will come to pay their respects, and the ceremony will be extremely solemn. Before, Songjiang was lost, and Mr. Zhang's hometown suffered losses. The whole family moved to Shanghai. His wife, Madam Xu, his son, Shao修, is a skilled medical practitioner, and his daughter is married to Chen. He has three grandsons and two granddaughters.

A Brief History of Mr. Zhang

Mr. Zhang's given name was Bao元, and his pen name was [默]. He was 67 years old this year. In his early years, he graduated from the Jiangyin Nan箐 Academy. He was sent by the government to Japan for observation. After returning to China, he was hired by this newspaper to write commentary. This was nine years before the Republic. At that time, this newspaper was planning reforms, and Mr. Zhang fully expressed his views and made many unique plans. After the Xinhai Revolution, Mr. Zhang devoted himself to promoting civil rights. On November 19th of the 17th year of the Republic, for the celebration of the 20,000th issue of this newspaper, the newspaper presented Mr. Zhang, who had served the longest and contributed the most, with a gold medal to honor him. In December of the 21st year of the Republic, Mr. Zhang celebrated his 60th birthday, and all the staff of the newspaper held a celebration. Mr. Zhang successively served as the deputy editor-in-chief and editor-in-chief of this newspaper. In this reorganization of this newspaper, he served as deputy editor-in-chief. In total, Mr. Zhang served this newspaper for 37 years.

Colleagues' Grief

Mr. Zhang Yunhe served this newspaper for 37 years. His diligence in handling affairs was unwavering from morning till night. He would be at his desk until midnight. He only took a short break. In the summer, the nights are short. Colleagues would finish their work and leave, and Mr. Zhang would go upstairs to sleep. By that time, the sky would be bright. He did this for thirty years. Mr. Zhang lived in the newspaper building and regarded this newspaper as his second home. He treated his colleagues with sincerity and tolerance, and set an example. He never spoke harshly. Colleagues were moved by this and worked diligently. Mr. Zhang once said that one's closest relatives are one's parents, wife, and children, but because we serve society, we cannot stay at home all day. We spend more time with our colleagues, so we should love and care for each other like brothers. Therefore, colleagues respected and loved Mr. Zhang. When we visited him during his illness, we were reluctant to leave. Mr. Zhang had no other hobbies in his life except for collecting ancient inkstones. He had many treasures. He had compiled an inkstone catalog, but it has not been published. When the news of Mr. Zhang's death reached the newspaper, all colleagues were saddened because his love for people will never be forgotten.

### Major Repair on Nanjing Road; Between Jiangxi Road and Sichuan Road

The section of Nanjing Road south of Jiangxi Road and Sichuan Road will undergo major repairs starting from the 20th of this month and is expected to be completed within a week. From that day on, rickshaws traveling east and west on Nanjing Road must turn at Sichuan Road and detour via Jiujiang Road. Pedestrians should also avoid walking on that section of Nanjing Road to avoid inconvenience.

### British Consul General in Guangzhou Comes to Shanghai for New Position

The British Consul General in Guangzhou, Paul Mason, and his wife arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong yesterday. It is reported that Mr. Mason has been transferred to Shanghai and will be appointed to a new position at the embassy here, but the official appointment order has not yet been announced.

### Negotiation on Cross-Border Road Construction Proceeding Smoothly; Fessenden to Take a Short Break in Singapore; Administration to Be Handled by Deputy Secretary-General Gerber

According to the English-language "China Press," the content of the negotiations between the Shanghai Municipal Council and the Shanghai Municipal Government on the issue of cross-border road construction is unknown. However, according to the Shanghai Municipal Council Secretary-General and Director-General, Fessenden, he told reporters today (the 17th) that the discussions between the two sides are currently proceeding very smoothly. In addition to the Chairman of the Municipal Council, Franklin, and Fessenden, those who participated in the negotiations yesterday also included the Italian Consul General and Leader Consul of Shanghai, Quinto Nironi, and the Japanese Consul General, Miura. Fessenden is scheduled to take the SS Conte Verde to Singapore for vacation on Sunday afternoon and will return to Shanghai in about three weeks. During his absence, the duties will be performed by Gerber, Deputy Secretary-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council.

### Russian Kidnapped into Puppet Court; Dies of Illness After Bail; Contracted Typhoid in Prison and Died Despite Treatment; Police Arrest One Suspect in Kidnapping Case

According to the "Continental Daily News," Russian citizen Krotkov, 40 years old, ran a grocery store at No. 144 Picardie Avenue. On the morning of November 19th last year, two Indian moneylenders and a Chinese person impersonating a Japanese person went to his store to demand repayment of a 200 yuan loan but were unsuccessful. They lured him out on the pretext of going to the Zha Shan police station. After leaving the store, he was bound and taken by bus to a certain station.

Transferred to Steamer

He was then transferred to a steamer to Pudong and detained in the Pudong Court Detention Center. He was only released after paying bail on January 2nd. However, in prison, he was confined in the same room with hundreds of prisoners, causing him to contract typhoid fever. He died on the 13th of this month at the Public Hospital. A detective from the Zha Shan police station reported that the investigation of this case had resulted in the arrest of one kidnapper on Gordon Road, and the case was transferred to the General Police Station for handling. The investigation is currently ongoing.

Krotkov Left Behind

A wife and two children, one only seven months old and one only two years old, are in dire straits. According to Krotkov's wife, when her husband was detained in Pudong, he obtained permission to be visited on December 21st. Two friends accompanied her to Pudong for the visit. The court notified her that she had to pay a 30 yuan bail. The next day, she returned to Pudong with the money, but the amount of

Bail Demanded

By the Dadao authorities increased daily, reaching 400 yuan. She also requested assistance from the White Russian Refugee Committee without success. She then asked a Chinese acquaintance for help and pawned many items, finally raising 100 yuan. She returned to Pudong on January 1st and repeatedly pleaded for the bail to be reduced to 160 yuan. The remaining 40 yuan was extorted by the prison guards. After Krotkov was released, he was extremely weak due to the poor food. He was sent to the Public Hospital by the White Russian Refugee Committee and died on the 12th of this month.

### Negotiation on Return of Patrol Boats; Japanese Response Evasive

More than ten Jianghai Customs patrol boats, including the Fuxing, Yunxing, Jiaoji, and Fuwei, have not yet been returned, except for the Lianxing, which has been returned. Despite repeated negotiations by Customs Commissioner Mellor and others, there has been no result. These patrol boats were requisitioned by the Japanese for military transport. During the Shanghai war, the Fuxing was hit by artillery fire and had a hole in its hull. It was rumored that the ship sank at sea. The Fuxing was an ocean-going mother ship, the largest of the patrol boats. According to the Datong News Agency, the Customs feels the lack of ships due to the rampant smuggling and piracy at sea. They have again negotiated with the Japanese side, but the Japanese response remains evasive, only agreeing to return the Yunxing. There is no definite indication on the release of the other patrol boats.

### Wusong Vegetable Vendors Strike

The Japanese want to control the vegetable business in this city, and the Wusong District is also within the scope of their control. They have specially demarcated land on Hongyuan Road in Wusong Town to set up a market as a unified sales location. Vegetable vendors entering the market must sell at low prices. This started on the previous day. Vegetable vendors from all four townships heard the news and, realizing that their livelihoods were being taken away, unanimously rejected this. Yesterday, vendors from Baoshan and Yang Township went on strike. Vendors from Luodian Township, who were not notified in advance, still carried vegetables to the market. After being informed of the situation, they all turned back halfway. Therefore, there were no vegetables in the Wusong market yesterday.

### Japanese Warships Bombarded the Longshan Area; Little Damage to the Area; Shells Fell on Longshan, Xiepu, and Mudflats; More Shelling This Morning, Details Unknown

Since the five-wheeled "war-guest" ships have returned, the turnaround time has been shortened, and the passenger capacity is not crowded. Travelers are convenient, and cargo transportation is very smooth. According to shipping industry news yesterday, Japanese warships have recently been harassing the eastern Zhejiang area. Several days ago, a Japanese gunboat was moored off the coast of Zhenhai Wai瀝 Port. By the morning of the day before yesterday (the 16th), this had increased to four ships, which patrolled the nearby waters. They also fired more than 20 shells at Longshan. It is reported that more than ten shells fell near Longshan Xiepu, causing slight damage. More than ten shells fell on the mudflats, causing no damage. One shell fell on the Fulong Temple, causing no damage. This morning, Japanese warships fired at Longshan again. The details are unknown. Zhenhai was not affected. As for the Shanghai-Ningbo route, which was originally scheduled to return to Shanghai today, it is still uncertain whether it will arrive as scheduled.

### Straits Settlements Ban: The National Goods Industry Suffers a Blow; Restriction on the Import of Goods Not Priced in British Pounds; Shanghai's Industrial Exports Will Inevitably Sharply Decline

A letter from Overseas National Goods Inspection Representative Gao Wangguomin states that the Straits Settlements government issued an official notice on November 17th of last year, announcing two lists of prohibited and restricted import goods, prohibiting and restricting the import of goods not priced in British pounds. If they are from British pound countries, they are not subject to prohibition and restriction. Shanghai is one of the prohibited countries. It has been found that there are 76 types of goods restricted from import into the Straits Settlements, and as many as 136 types prohibited. Shanghai's factory products exported to Southeast Asia reach 2 million yuan per day, and in the future, they will inevitably suffer a blow and sharply decline.

Prohibited Imports of Various Goods

The Straits Settlements government has announced a ban on the import of goods, the major ones of which are related to the city's industry or commerce, including the following: (1) Biscuits for human consumption; (2) Candies (including chocolates); (3) Sweet wine; (4) Fertilizers; (5) Electrical appliances; (6) Unsheathed electric wires; (7) All light bulbs; (8) Electric lights; (9) Electrical lamp accessories other than porcelain and stone; (10) Electrical machinery other than telegraphs and telephones; (11) Electric fans and their products; (12) Soft clothing (excluding hats); (13) Socks other than cotton or rayon fabrics; (14) Coats other than cotton or rayon fabrics; (15) Knitted or silk undershirts; (16) Knitted or silk other shirts and trousers; (17) Candles; (18) Leather; (19) Other leather goods; (20) Envelopes; (21) Rubber shoes; (22) Rubber soles and heels; (23) Bicycle and tricycle inner tubes; (24) Solid tires; (25) Ivory, bone, horn, artificial ivory toys; (26) Other various decorations; (27) Lacquerware; (28) Tooth powder, toothpaste; (29) Various silverware; (30) Silver thread; (31) Umbrellas.

National Goods Organizations Negotiating

A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency learned from national goods organizations in this city yesterday that several items manufactured by factories in this city cannot be exported at all now, such as wool fabrics, leather products, rubber shoes, electric lights, light bulbs, etc. As for the city's major exports of knitted shirts, flashlights, and some cosmetics, they are still not prohibited and can be exported as usual. However, because of the unusually large number of prohibited goods, the city's industry, generally speaking, will suffer a serious blow. At present, national goods organizations in this city are extremely anxious about this move by the Straits Settlements and are currently trying to negotiate with the local government, and will also request the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to consult with the Straits Settlements government.

### Nanshi Uses Short-Term Permits; Gambling is Open; Houses Are All Booked; Flower Shows Have Been Discovered

Since the Japanese side suddenly strictly inspected permits to Nanshi, those holding citizen cards from October onwards have not been allowed to enter or exit. Whether it is the Xin Kaihe Iron Gate, the Nanshi Wharf Ferry, or even detouring through the Hongqiao Road in Western Shanghai, obstacles have arisen. The puppet "Political Affairs Department" has asked Japanese Welfare Squad Leader Okishima to find a solution at the Japanese Special Service Department in Hongkou, so he discussed it with Kikuchi, the commander of the Japanese Garrison in Nanshi. However, because the "garrison force" in Nanshi is insufficient, there has been no proper solution. It is said that it will be tentatively opened on the 20th of this month. If there are no accidents, it may be opened for a long time. However, now the public can enter and exit if they have a short-term permit issued by the puppet organization at the Tianhou Palace. As for the Nanshi city, from Huamu Field to the City God Temple, all the houses have been booked by earthwork gangs and gambling dens. The large teahouses in the Yuyuan Garden have been converted into gambling dens, and the flower shows in the Nine Mu Field have opened. Every day, gamblers come and go like a mountain path.

### Boiled Water Industry Sends Representatives to the Chamber of Commerce to Petition; Approval to Urge Various Industries to Group Purchase Coal

The Shanghai Boiled Water Industry Association has gained sympathy from all walks of life in the city for denying price increases. However, the industry believes that the fundamental solution lies in reducing coal prices. In addition to separate consultations with the coal industry, it will also send representatives in the coming days with letters to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Chinese Ratepayers Association of the Public Concession, the Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation, and other powerful organizations, as well as prominent business figures Yu Qiaqing and Yuan Ludeng, to personally explain the industry's plight and seek assistance: (1) Approval to urge various industries to group purchase coal; (2) Forward a letter to the Kailuan Mining Company, within the possible scope, to sell the coal dust required by the industry to the industry for application. According to a reporter from Xinsheng News Agency, all of the city's more than 500 boiled water shops have uniformly followed the methods discussed by the industry association and are proceeding step by step in order to achieve them. If coal prices can be effectively stabilized, the industry also intends to restore the original price of water sales, and hopes that all industries will respond together, and do not publicly decide to raise prices on the pretext of expensive raw materials and increased costs. This will be of great concern to the citizens' burden.

### Shanghai Municipal Council; Senior Police Officers Transferred

Assistant Superintendent MacDonald has been transferred to District Chief of District B. The above officers have been ordered to be assigned to their respective duties.

### Central Mint's Rental House Eviction Case; Second Trial Verdict: Eviction by the End of June

A large Western-style house at 1877 Avenue Joffre in the French Concession is the unique property of Tao Huayufang, the wife of Gan Ren Tao Jiayao, the former Governor of Jiangxi Province and current Chairman of the China Funeral Home, and is leased by the Tongan Company. After August 22nd, it was rented by the Central Mint as an office, while the Tao couple rented a residence at Lane 6, 753 Route Haig. Later, Tao Huayufang sold this property to a Russian doctor, George, but the Central Mint refused to move out, making it impossible to hand over the property, compensate for damages, and terminate the sales contract. Subsequently, the lease on the house Tao was living in on Route Haig expired, and Tao requested the Central Mint to move out and take it back for his own residence, but without result. Tao Huayufang filed a lawsuit in the Civil Court of the Second Special District against Tan Song, the legal representative of the Central Mint, seeking eviction and compensation for damages. In the first and second trials, the court held that the house on Route Haig was rented by Tao Jiayao in his own name, which was insufficient to prove that it was taken back for personal use, and that the sales contract between Tao Huayufang and George specified the address as 670 Route Haig, recognizing that Tao Huayufang had another residence. Therefore, the court ruled that Tao Huayufang's request was dismissed in its entirety. Tao then appointed lawyers Li Guozhen and Li Yujun to file an appeal with the Shanghai Special District Branch of the Supreme Court.

### Grain: Flour and Wheat Amidst a Frenzy of Price Increases - Reimported Flour Nears Eleven Yuan - Wheat Prices Want to Open at Twenty Yuan

Wheat Flour: Yesterday's market showed no sign of slowing down in price increases. The spot price for No. 2 flour actually reached ten yuan, immediately attracting attention. As a result, factories have temporarily stopped raising prices, but they have also slightly restricted retail transactions on the street. Customer purchases are being carefully controlled and not offered, creating opportunities for foreign flour and reimported goods. Yesterday, a significant number of packages were directly distributed to customers, including foreign brands such as Bing Chuan, Pao Che, and Bian Fu Pai. Transactions were approximately 5,000 bags, with prices reaching as high as eleven yuan. Old reimported flour in warehouse receipts was sold for ten yuan and seven jiao, then further increased to ten yuan, eight jiao, and nine fen. The market has gone from tense to chaotic. Wild speculation is rampant and not indicative of the actual market. While rice prices are declining, the frenzy in flour prices is more severe than the rice price surge. However, since Southerners primarily eat rice, only the middle and upper classes have yet to feel the pain, while the impact on the poor who mix flour into their diets is quite significant.

Wheat: Trading volume remained low yesterday, but the market appeared to be gaining momentum. Suppliers were not hoarding for profit, and some even anticipated a high price of twenty yuan. However, Chinese factories are currently considering purchasing foreign wheat when the opportunity arises, and they are unwilling to pay the peak price of eighteen yuan for local wheat. Speculators and Japanese factories are still secretly absorbing supplies. It is said that yesterday, wheat prices at the grain shops had already exceeded the eighteen-yuan mark, with asking prices ranging from eighteen yuan and one jiao to eighteen yuan. Prices below eighteen yuan were for ordinary quality wheat. There was also little supply on the market.

Miscellaneous Grains: Among miscellaneous grains, 415 bags of beans arrived from Tianjin yesterday. Today, 713 bags will be shipped to Hong Kong. Additionally, 2,000 bags of mung beans and 2,000 bags of corn will be shipped to Yantai.

### Rice Prices Drop Again - Market Sentiment Weak

Yesterday, domestic rice varieties such as Qing Si arrived at Hongkou, but they have not yet been distributed from that area. Therefore, there were few samples of domestic rice on the market, and sales were still limited to small purchases by local shops. With scarce transactions between buyers and sellers, supply and demand were evenly matched, following the original spot price. The Bai Yuan brand was slightly more popular than before, but prices were difficult to increase. After an initial rebound, prices for various foreign rice varieties weakened yesterday as customers remained on the sidelines. Consequently, reimported goods became more prevalent, and the market experienced a continued decline in prices. At the same time, merchants with large inventories, seeing the market weakening, followed suit by selling aggressively. In a short time, the price of Ruo Xin Huo Jiao rice dropped by more than half a yuan, opening at only twenty-six yuan and two jiao. Chen Si, however, was able to hold relatively steady due to the limited supply in the market, but was still inevitably affected, dropping one or two jiao. No. 1 Saigon rice was priced at thirty-seven yuan and two jiao, and thirty-seven yuan, No. 2 Saigon at thirty-six yuan. Other rice varieties such as Mi Lu and Dong Jing Jian Di have low bids, and due to unwillingness to sell by sellers, prices did not drop much. Mi Lu was priced at thirty-three yuan, and Dong Jing Jian Di at thirty-three yuan and a half, and thirty-three yuan. However, in the late market, as the closing time approached, the price of Ruo Xin Huo Jiao rice suddenly increased as customers generally believed that prices had already bottomed out, resulting in a tighter closing market.

The supply of foreign rice has been abundant in recent days. In addition to Saigon and Haiphong orders arriving one after another, shipments from Hong Kong have also been arriving entirely. Amidst the light sales before the Spring Festival, the market continued to decline. A slight drop was initially seen in the morning, but the market stabilized again in the afternoon as customers and shops absorbed the lower prices. No. 1 Saigon rice was still priced at thirty-seven yuan and a half, and the price of broken rice also returned to its initial level. New orders from abroad have been reported as small. However, high-end Saigon No. 2 has not been traded widely, with only the price of broken rice reported as low as thirty-three yuan. There have been a few transactions for new orders and reimported goods. Furthermore, in addition to purchasing thousands of tons of futures broken rice in recent days, Japanese merchants also bought in the market yesterday, increasing the purchase price to thirty-five yuan and a half. However, the transaction did not proceed due to the merchant not agreeing to pay a deposit.

### Finance: Importers Settling - Futures Foreign Exchange

In the foreign exchange market yesterday, the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) quotations remained unchanged. The unofficial situation in the British and American exchange markets was initially mixed. However, since HSBC had a strong appetite for buying, the market closed flat. Initially, the exchange rate between the U.S. and Britain suddenly reported a decline, causing the market to open with a tight U.S. and steady British exchange rate. Subsequently, as a certain bank took the lead in supplying, and many Chinese merchants released their long positions, and Hong Kong telegrams also slightly decreased, the rate soon rose to four and nine-three-seven-five and eight yuan, one-eight-seven-five. Unexpectedly, at this time, HSBC purchased cheaply, Japanese merchants aggressively entered futures, and Sassoon also showed buying interest, causing the market to soften. HSBC came again to absorb, while yarn factories also slightly bought in, causing prices to continue to stabilize.

After the opening, a certain bank came to unload, and speculative traders also followed suit, and at the same time, Hong Kong telegrams entrusted Chinese banks to buy, resulting in an oversupply. The shape was soft and hard. By 9:30, British gold had risen to four pence, nine-three-seven-five, and the U.S. rate also hardened to eight yuan, one-eight-seven-five. At that time, the U.S. rate for this month was still difficult to find buyers at eight yuan, one-eight-seven-five. The HSBC quotation was announced and remained unchanged. The silver balance tax was announced to be bought in. Japanese and Western merchants Sassoon simultaneously showed buying interest, and sellers, Chinese merchants, etc., suddenly decreased, so the market stopped loosening and softened. At 9:50, British gold reached four pence, nine-zero-six-two-five, and the U.S. rate reached eight yuan, one-two-five. Later, it once stabilized. Around 11:00, HSBC came again to absorb, coupled with yarn factories also buying in, causing the situation to continue to flatten. British gold four pence, eight-nine-zero-six-two-five, U.S. exchange eight yuan, zero-six-two-five, British gold for this month four pence, eight-seven-five, U.S. exchange seven yuan, nine-three-seven-five, the result compared to the previous day's current rate, British was neither honored nor disgraced, and U.S. was both squeezed tight zero-three-one-two-five.

### The Gold Market is Difficult to Expect to Improve

Yesterday's spot and unofficial market conditions for gold, although the foreign exchange result was flat, the gold price continued to decline, unbearable to look back. The market is indeed lacking positive news, and the Hong Kong gang once came to absorb, but the number was few, resulting in the market's weary state of mind, and it is difficult to improve. The morning opening was four thousand and forty yuan, down another small ten yuan from yesterday. This is because the foreign exchange is still loose. Subsequently, some gold shops slightly bought in, and the price slightly recovered by three yuan. However, because the foreign exchange was still loose, securities gangs came to aggressively plug out, and spot gold shops and silver shop gangs also followed suit to cash out. And at that time, most buyers were watching, and the price fell to a low of four thousand and twenty yuan. Subsequently, as the exchange market softened, a certain securities gang took the opportunity to drag in at a cheap price, and a certain money exchange industry and silver shop gangs mutually plugged out a lot. Therefore, it only recovered by nineteen yuan. Later, because buyers were satisfied, the afternoon closing was still only four thousand and thirty yuan. In the afternoon, the foreign exchange market was closed, and the situation slightly stabilized. The result was a closing price of four thousand and thirty-four yuan, down another sixteen yuan compared to the previous day. The whole day's transactions were about eight or nine hundred taels. Silver shop ornaments remained fixed. Shanghai gold, etc., remained flat.

Shanghai Gold Fell Another Sixteen Yuan

Since the morning, each bar (ten taels) initially opened the exchange market continued to harden, and people's hearts were even more tired. The opening fell by a small ten yuan, the money exchange industry sold to the silver shop gang ten taels for four thousand and forty yuan. After a while, gold shops pulled in, and the price recovered by three yuan, with gold shops taking ten taels, for four thousand and forty-three yuan. Subsequently, because the exchange market reported loosening again, the securities gang immediately came to sell, and spot gold shops and money exchange industries also followed suit to pour out, coupled with weak buyers, the price gradually retreated by twenty-three yuan, with spot gold shops selling ten taels to the money exchange industry for four thousand and twenty yuan. Then another securities gang saw the cheap price and dragged in, and not long after the foreign exchange market softened, plus a certain money exchange industry suddenly purchased on behalf of the Hong Kong gang, causing general floating households to come back in slightly, and the price recovered by nineteen yuan, with gold shops taking twenty taels from the money exchange industry for four thousand and thirty-nine yuan. After this, the money exchange industry came back to spit out, and at the same time the silver shop gang also followed suit to sell slightly, and went down again, the silver shop gang spitting out ten taels to the securities gang for four thousand and ten yuan as the afternoon closing price. The afternoon state was slightly stable, and the opening price rose by one yuan, with gold shops taking ten taels from the money exchange industry for four thousand and thirty-three yuan. Later, the spot gold shop spit out to suppress two yuan, selling thirty taels to the securities gang for four thousand and thirty yuan.

The result was a further drop of sixteen yuan compared to the previous day. It has been a small drop for four consecutive days, totaling fifty-one yuan. The whole day fluctuated by twenty-three yuan. The selling price of the current brand gold of the spot gold shop is several yuan higher according to the Shanghai gold, and the purchase price is reduced by twenty yuan. The current bid gold is more than fifty yuan lower than the listed gold, and few are made open.

### US Dollar Tickets Fall, Then Rise

Yesterday, foreign currencies stabilized, with minimal fluctuations. British and American gold pounds had scarce supply and demand, and prices were unchanged. British gold tickets were quiet, with no price fluctuations. US dollar tickets initially weakened, once falling to twelve yuan, two jiao, and four fen. Subsequently, customers took advantage of the low prices to absorb, and the market rebounded, rising to twelve yuan, three jiao, and six fen in the evening. Hong Kong tickets and Hong Kong exchange were loose due to supply and demand, and the market fell accordingly. French franc tickets had scarce demand, and the market was slightly weak. Japanese gold tickets had abundant supply, falling to yuan, two jiao, six fen, and two li in the evening. Korean tickets fell to zero yuan and three fen due to the drop in cloth prices in North China and smoother transport to Shanghai. Yesterday's market prices saw US dollar tickets rise two fen, Hong Kong tickets fall one fen, and French francs fall three li. All other currencies remained unchanged.

### Securities - Bond Market Prospering - Class C Demand Particularly Strong

The securities unofficial market yesterday was trending extremely firm. Except for Class A, which saw some profit-taking due to excessive buying pressure, the upward momentum stalled slightly, but the rest were still thriving. Among them, Class C in particular was seeing increasing demand, making it a standout. Investors consider its market price to be cheap, while its rights are equal. Therefore, this type of government bond, following behind the other bonds, is about to break through the 50-yuan mark. Although there are no concrete news, the atmosphere of peace remains strong. Trading was weaker yesterday. In the morning, buyers favored De Zi, and Tong Kang, Hong Da, and Tong Shun also saw demand. Run Li, Xie Da, Lian He, and De Ji saw slight supply and demand. Market prices still rose slightly. Due to the extremely strong peace atmosphere after the close of the previous day, Class C had traded above 51 yuan. Yesterday, because there was no newspaper confirmation, the trend stabilized. Class C was considered cheap at its market price, so it was desired by many. In the afternoon, sellers suddenly became scarce, and buyers were still quite enthusiastic, especially retail investors. Class C traded at 50 yuan, nine jiao and a half, a new high. Other bank shares are also gradually advancing. As a result, except for Class A, which was down slightly by five fen, the rest were up between one jiao and a half to one jiao and a half. The total transaction volume was approximately 700,000 yuan. A brief summary is listed below.

### Yarn and Cotton - Spot Yarn Active in Hong Kong Sales - A Total of Over 1,500 Packages Handled in the Past Two Days

The yarn market continues on a quiet path. The long-dormant Hong Kong gang is gradually seeing sales for 10-count to 20-count coarse yarn. The Hong Kong gang purchased 1,000 packages of 32-count Jinji brand and 20-count Jinji brand yesterday afternoon. This morning, they continued to buy over 400 packages. As a result, people's hearts gradually turned, and some people are trying to buy on the expectation of rising prices. There are also reports that the gang purchased about 2,400 packages, half of which are speculative in nature. Shipments are still scarce, but customers' minds are more active than before. However, the downward trend of foreign exchange is even stronger.

The morning opening of spot yarn had the possibility of rising, due to real demand activity. However, the strong downward trend of foreign exchange and the sharp drop in Indian cotton were also constraints. Therefore, the opening price of 20-count Shuangma was 727 yuan, with little change from the previous day. Subsequently, news of continued transactions by the Guangdong gang cheered people up again, reaching 729 yuan. But the softening of exchange rates prevented the buying trend, so the situation was little changed. The statistics show that 2,935 packages were transacted during the day. The market price of 20-count Shuangma rose one yuan and a half, and the rest were flat. Yong'an Factory opened 80 packages of 20-count special Jincheng brand at a price of 726 yuan. Today, 20 pieces of yarn will be shipped to Hong Kong. The daily purchase volume of each gang is listed below.

Another Message: The market price of foreign cotton, the New York cotton market, initially fell this morning due to pressure from sellers. Later, it fell due to overseas merchants and long positions liquidating. The closing market turned, resulting in a drop of 22 to 56 points compared to the previous day. The Indian cotton forecast fell nearly 10 rupees, Egyptian fell more than 10 pounds, and Liverpool fell 20 pence.

Shanghai foreign cotton transactions, each trader is optimistic about raw cotton again, so the transactions turned active again, but the number is small. The factory is still unmoved. Japanese manufacturers are also very quiet. The US exchange rate on cotton market yesterday is as follows:

20 branches of Mitelin 238.30

20 branches of second grade cotton  226.00

### Silk and Tea: Domestic and Foreign Silk Prices Continue to Plunge - White Silk Factories Plunge Below the 5,000 Yuan Mark

The foreign silk market is still in a steep decline. Hengbing is still unable to start auctions. New York near and far-term futures each fell 25 cents, hitting the limit. Japanese silk 83 cents fell 19 cents, and 75 cents fell 21 cents. Shanghai silk fell 26 cents.

The local silk market is also weak and unable to recover. It is said that yesterday white silk factories' silk had fallen below the 5,000 yuan mark. Yesterday, American and French loading and Indian and African silk sales were unusually sluggish. Normal silk transactions still require silk prices to stabilize before they can return to normal. Also, 10 loads of yellow silk arrived from Yantai yesterday.

48 pieces of tea are shipped to Tianjin, and 207 pieces will be shipped to Hong Kong today.

### Piece Goods - Spring and Summer Goods Have Started - Selling Prices Are Mostly Rising - Dongbu Goods Are Also Expensive

Domestic cloth - Because the foreign markets for domestic products are still smooth, and the selling price is better than domestic prices, factories are competing to take export business, so domestic sales are normal. The market is affected by this, and the current prices are high. Yesterday, fine white cloth increased by 2 jiao to 2.5 jiao per piece. All kinds of light-colored fine yarn goods for spring and summer, as various customers are concerned about wartime transportation problems, are being promoted especially early. Selling prices for each piece are increasing by 2.5 jiao to 5 jiao. Dark-colored cloth is not in demand, and although costs have increased, asking prices are flat. However, the price of blue cloth and other common goods is up by 1 jiao and a half per piece. This month, over 50,000 pieces of white cloth base fabric were sold. The Zhejiang-Jiangxi gang purchased over 100 pieces of bleached cloth, printed cloth, and fine cloth from Yihe Lun Chang. The Fujian gang purchased over 100 pieces of white-based colored flower cloth and bleached colored twill. The gang purchased 100 pieces of silk and satin fabric. There are also significant amounts purchased for foreign exports. Today, 25 pieces of cloth will be shipped to Hong Kong.

Dongbu Cloth - Yesterday, the market for fine twill cloth continued to be firm. Because the actual demand for dyeing base fabrics in this street is strong, the spot transactions reached about 1,000 pieces. The current price for 2-pound Dragon Head fine cloth is already being quoted at 12 yuan and 3 jiao. The industry is opening prices of 22 yuan and 8 jiao for next month's goods, and 22 yuan and 7 jiao for Yanghe Caiqiu, so the industry's thinking is stable, and most are unwilling to sell cheaply.

### Sugar Market - 200 Tons of Coarse White Sugar Transacted

The sugar market remains weak. The labor union's price for spot No. 24 coarse white sugar is 56 yuan and 5 jiao. Transit goods are unchanged. Taikoo white sugar is also lacking in price changes. Spot Dutch red sugar is a small 5 jiao, at 44 yuan. According to the Dutch telegram, 200 tons of coarse white sugar were transacted, and the ex-ship price is 7.13 guilders. National sugar merchants are holding back and releasing little sugar. According to news from the Jianbang, this year's Quanzhou sugar harvest is similar to last year's, but prices are more expensive. Due to transportation difficulties, it is temporarily being held in storage. Yesterday, 30 packages arrived from Xiamen.

### Medicinal Materials - New Chuzhou Chrysanthemums Have Arrived in Shanghai

Chuzhou Chrysanthemum is a specialty of Chuzhou, and it is also an important medicine for calming the liver. The annual output is originally not much. After the war, transportation was difficult, and it was difficult to transport to Shanghai. It is reported that Chuzhou guests collectively purchased only four or five loads of high-quality goods, and it took a lot of hardship to arrive in Shanghai. It is now entrusted to Shengchang Medicine Store in Qingyang Li, Paociqiu Road, to sell it.

### A Perspective on Rising Flour Prices

Amidst the clamor of skyrocketing rice prices, flour prices have also been steadily climbing, exceeding the ten-yuan mark. Reporters believe that the high cost of rice is simply due to supply falling short of demand, and dwindling reserves. However, the reason for the increase in flour prices is unclear. After repeated investigations, it has been discovered that various factors are at play, which are now being disclosed in the newspaper for the study of those concerned about the people's livelihood.

Raw Material Factors

The raw material for flour is wheat. The amount of Shanghai Hua Wheat arriving since the new harvest last year is less than one-third of the amount from the year before last. Currently, it is already the off-season, and very little is arriving continuously. The reserves of each warehouse are only eighty to ninety thousand bags, resulting in skyrocketing wheat prices. The current price is seventeen to eighteen yuan in national currency per fifty kilograms. During this time of year, there are usually imports of foreign wheat, but since the start of the European War, foreign wheat has become extremely expensive. England and the United States can barely supply themselves. Even if there are exports, each dan [unit of weight] would cost twenty-eight to twenty-nine yuan. Australia is more conveniently located, but half of the new wheat capable of being exported has already been claimed by the mother country. India is also buying, and each dan also costs twenty-five to twenty-six yuan in Shanghai currency. Furthermore, transportation is extremely scarce, and the shipping cost has increased three to four times, requiring seventy shillings per ton. Therefore, even if foreign wheat can be ordered, the price would be difficult to lower. With expensive raw materials, prices are naturally difficult to lower.

Supply and Demand Factors

With the shortage of wheat raw materials, the output of flour is naturally difficult to increase. After rice prices soared, the sales of flour increased sharply, and prices rose accordingly. It is true that flour prices have exceeded ten yuan, but manufacturers still believe that compared to wheat prices, they are losing more than one yuan per bag. Australian foreign flour is quoted at thirteen yuan per bag, and American flour at sixteen yuan per bag, which is certainly more expensive than domestic flour. However, this involves exchange rates and the drier quality of the flour. Manufacturers often use high wheat prices as an excuse for rising flour prices. Grain dealers believe that flour prices are so high that (after rice prices rise) wheat prices should follow. The relationship between the chicken and the egg is self-evident, like the echo following the sound of the drum, like the shadow following the body. Furthermore, they believe that this cannot be compared to the speculation and hoarding of rice. In fact, the recycled flour market seen every day is unknown from where it comes. If no one is hoarding, where does this recycled flour come from? This shows that there are indeed people manipulating it in secret.

### Prison Overcrowding

— Huang Jiayin

Shanghai must be considered a very densely populated place. Everywhere you go, it is crowded with people, a sea of people. Movie theaters are full, dance halls are full, hotels and restaurants are full, and shelters are full. Now, even prisons are suffering from overcrowding.

Considering the overcrowding, it may be enough to show the effectiveness of the police authorities, but at the same time, it can also be seen that Shanghai society is full of talented evildoers.

How to solve the problem of this endless stream of "social sinners" is, we feel, a very important question. Prisons are overcrowded, so we can certainly expand the prisons or build a few more to accommodate them, but this is not a fundamental solution.

According to the famous American lawyer Hayes, historically, the less severe the punishment, the fewer the criminals. Conversely, the heavier the punishment, the more the criminals. It can be seen that punishment is not the correct way to treat crime.

Crime has environmental oppression, different motives, and background relationships. It should not be punished by imprisonment across the board, nor should it be dealt with entirely by means of isolation through imprisonment.

Modern criminal law is about treating crime, not about treating people. Treating the head when it hurts and treating the foot when it hurts is certainly not a good way to cure disease, but to be honest, the methods we use to treat social ills are not even up to that standard. We prescribe a prescription for a headache, use the same prescription for a foot ache, and still use that prescription for a stomach ache.

This is not clever, not reasonable, and not thorough.

Psychology

### Three Mice

— Fangren

At a recent gathering of the American Psychological Association, a film was shown. The content of the film showed Professor Maurer of Yale University experimenting with three mice.

Professor Maurer specially made ten cages, each equipped with an automatic food dispensing machine. Each time the lever was pressed, a small piece of food would fall out of a small hole. At first, he installed the lever and the small hole together. After the three mice were placed in the cages, they immediately understood and took turns pressing the lever to get food.

Afterwards, Professor Maurer modified the food dispensing machine so that the lever and the small hole were located at opposite ends of the cage. This required them to run to the other end of the cage after pressing the lever in order to get food. After setting it up, he alternately placed the mice into the cage individually. As a result, they quickly learned how to do it. Finally, Professor Maurer put them all in together, but the situation was very different.

On the first day, they all gathered around the small hole, sniffing, but none of them wanted to go to the other side to press the lever. Occasionally, one would go over and press it, but the reward that fell out of the small hole was always quickly snatched up by the other two, and they themselves could not enjoy it. The next day, the output from the small hole decreased. On the third day, they were so hungry that they even tried to break the iron small hole.

It was not until the fourth day that one of them suddenly realized. It quickly pressed the lever three times in a row, then ran to the other end of the cage and just happened to get the last piece of food that fell out. So it continued to press, and even doubled the number of presses. Sometimes, it could press it up to six times in one or two seconds. It ran back and forth for an hour and a half, pressing it a total of one thousand one hundred and fifty-six times. It and its companions were finally satisfied. One of the other two also pressed it three times, and the other sat back and enjoyed the food until the end.

After watching the above experiment, we can understand a social problem. Mice are not humans, but they are both animals in nature. To put it bluntly, there is probably not much difference between humans and mice. The reason why there are various classes in society is due to the natural psychological tendency of everyone to be selfish and self-interested. Those who are willing to work hard are the heroes who are the first to know and understand. Society relies on them to exist, and humanity relies on them to not be destroyed. At the same time, they are also increasing their own value. Those who are not willing to work hard will inevitably wear the ugly label of parasites, not only becoming the moths of society and humanity, but also making their own value worthless.

Professor Maurer's experiment has profound meaning. This is not a general fable, but a real and reliable fact obtained from science. It is not an accidental opportunity, but the result of gradual exploration. If we want this society to be more reasonable and more equal, we should abandon the tendency to be selfish and self-interested, and embrace the "I will go to hell if others don't" mentality, adhere to our respective positions, and shoulder our respective responsibilities. This is the best and fastest path. Otherwise, we will be wearing the elegant title of the spirit of all things in vain, and we will not even be as good as a mouse. Ask ourselves, can we not be ashamed to die?

Sketches

### Father's Photo Album

— Yingjin

My father has been dead for eleven years. The only memento he left behind is a wood-grain scarlet leather photo album.

On the gray-black paper, B-shaped pointed corners held each photo in place. There were beautiful and elegant landscapes, thought-provoking historical sites, fleets sailing across the sea, magnificent streets, and snapshots of some familiar people...

But what I often love to flip through is that I found traces of my childhood there. The bald-headed child standing on my father's lap is me, the one sitting on the soft grass learning to play the trumpet with my younger brother is me, the one standing in the fields letting the kite break into the long sky is me, and the one sitting at the desk frowning and pondering with a pen in hand is also me...

Like a row of trees that have been cut in half, exposing their annual rings, in the photos, I see the years dragging me as I gradually grow up.

Was my father ultimately a writer? I always have this riddle-like question in my heart.

There is a photo with such a picture: at night, it is dark outside the window. In the quiet room, a red candle is lit on the table: I sit by the table and stare at the dancing flame on the table. —Next to that photo, my father wrote in clerical script: "Let the child in the darkness see a glimmer of light!"

Another photo shows this: at dawn, in the background of nature, the sun rises from the morning mist, and a child walks towards it. And that child is me. ——My father's annotation is: "Child! Recognize your direction. This is the place where the sun rises, the source of light!"

I am too forgetful to remember the scene when my father took pictures of me.

My father has been dead for eleven years, and today I finally understand his instructions.

Anecdotes

### Strolling Down the Street with George Bernard Shaw

— Huazhi

In London after the outbreak of the war, people were quiet. Writers were too lazy to pick up their pens. Like Mr. George Bernard Shaw, he would rather stroll down the street.

One day, I was very fortunate to follow Mr. Shaw for a walk on "Regent Street." He was very happy and dressed quite nicely, with a greenish-yellow tie and a pair of brown-spotted fleece gloves. As we walked, every woman who passed by looked back at Shaw in surprise from time to time, but the men seemed indifferent to him.

George Bernard Shaw walked very briskly. No matter how old an elderly person was, he could not catch up with him. He also lightly waved his cane. No matter how tense the situation in Europe was, it seemed very ordinary to him. He walked while browsing the shop windows.

He began by standing in front of a bookstore. There was nothing in the window, only the first editions of Kipling's books were displayed. At this time, in front of the Naval and Military Club across the street, there were people selling evening newspapers, handing him the newly released evening newspaper. "Mr. Shaw, your spiritual food is here." But Shaw replied, "No, thank you."

After walking for a while, Shaw suddenly stopped in front of a sword shop, his eyes fixed on a bulletproof vest. I was a little curious and couldn't help but ask, "Are you buying a bulletproof vest?" "No," Shaw said, "Just looking. A pacifist can't resist bullets either."

The topic then turned to the international situation. I asked him with a humorous tone whether Chamberlain had sent a telegram to congratulate Hitler on his recent escape from the bombing in Munich. Shaw replied that he had not. But he said: "Prime Minister Chamberlain should congratulate him. The Prime Minister's congratulatory telegram could say: 'We regret that you escaped danger, but the British government cannot but express its congratulations that you were harmed.'"

Shaw talked about the reasons why he and Hitler fell out. In addition to Hitler's violent anti-Semitic policies, he also believed that the national government should be built on a single idol, which was completely hypocritical. No country in the world can do this.

Unfortunately, Shaw's poster was banned from being posted by the Irish authorities and could only be published in newspapers. Shaw was very angry when he said this, scolding their autocratic attitude, no less than Hitler's.

He waved his cane again. The conversation then died down, turned the corner in front of a famous pub, and we turned into St. James's Street. (Translated from the Manchester Guardian)

### The Last Surviving Tan-Style Lao Sheng [elderly male role], Gui Houqing, Dies in Harbin

— Sick Dove

Recently, Mr. Xu Muyun mentioned Gui Junqing in his "Unofficial History of the Pear Garden" in this magazine, which is very heartwarming. Junqing has been in Shanghai for a long time. Unfortunately, after he stopped singing and left Shanghai, there was no news for more than ten years. He has white hair and a turtle-like age. I don't know where he has been wandering. Unexpectedly, news recently came that Junqing had died of illness in Harbin a month ago. His funeral was simple, and his situation was extremely miserable. In recent years, Gui has been stationed in Harbin, specializing in teaching to make a living, and occasionally serving as a private tutor for several amateur opera troupes. The monthly income from tuition fees is only enough to make ends meet. His son is also an actor, but he is not well-known. I lament that the old artist has a whole body of skills, but there is no one to pass them on. From then on, the Tan school will become a swan song, which is very sad.

Junqing is proficient in Russian and once worked as a translator for a certain pavilion. He was also an amateur opera enthusiast who changed his profession. His voice was initially very broad and bright, but after selling his skills, it gradually became weak and tired. Later, he became mute and could not make a sound. His attainments in learning the Tan style were no less than Shu Yan's. Whether it was raising a hand or taking a step, he could achieve complete likeness. His learning ability was exquisite, almost confusing the real with the fake. Although his voice was hoarse, it was rich in the charm of the Tan style. Singing and speaking do not rely solely on a good voice. It is important to pronounce words correctly and have a flavor. Correct pronunciation then has power. Once the words have power, even a poor tone can be clearly heard from a distance. A voice with charm makes the singing and speaking flavorful. However, a voice with charm cannot be found in one out of a hundred people. Gui had this talent, and it was logical for him to become successful. How could he know that he would be destitute for a lifetime and never achieve his ambitions? Is it not the misfortune of his encounters? He really has no confidant.

I have watched Gui's operas and felt that what was most like Old Tan was his attitude and expression, and singing rhyme second. According to his repertoire, "Cang San" and "Bai Man" were his best plays. When he plays Hong Yangdong, he made a strange and dangerous appearance, to the point of death. The movements in between were so similar to a real death that there was no difference. His heart and soul were concentrated, and his expression was lifelike. This is Old Tan's unique skill, which is quite difficult to understand. Only he can do it. Also, when singing the line "The most lamentable thing is that Jiao Meng will die in the enemy camp," the falling sound of the word "ying" [camp] is often made in an earth tone by other actors, but Gui is not like that. He pronounced the word "ying" extremely accurately, with a sad and beautiful tone, and a deep and rich intonation. However, this can only be said to be the language of a confidant, not enough to tell today's actors. As for his singing "Celebrating the Pearl," to the line "Suddenly raising my head, I see the red sun falling in the Western Gorge," the intonation was appropriate, far-reaching, and moving. In my mind, I seemed to see a white-bearded old man fishing by the river in a small boat in the twilight. The scenery in front of me was as if I was there in person. The tone and charm deeply grasped the essence of Old Tan. This kind of divine skill depends entirely on talent, which can be obtained but not sought. Among the Tan school talents, in addition to Junqing, only Luo Xiaobao has this skill. Although Xiaobao's breath is weak, when his spirit is radiant, a song comes, full of bow and full of tune, with both sound and appearance, and a unique charm. Unfortunately, he is trapped in his hobbies and does not strive for self-improvement, so he dies depressed. Most of the rising talents are limited by their voice, spirit, and tone, and they sing lower and lower. They only learn Tan's softness, not Tan's strength; they learn Tan's lowness, not Tan's highness. They are delicate and charming, seeking cleverness, not seeking thorough understanding. Moreover, they are induced by the environment, hurting themselves, and thus become decadent sounds. Now that I hear that the old generation is dying out, I am even more saddened. I would like to express a few words, not enough to express my remaining feelings.

### Roosevelt's Eldest Son Prepares to Run His Own Film Company

— Huazhi

The eldest son of US President Roosevelt is a famous and versatile figure. He has served as his presidential father's private secretary, done insurance business, and served in the military. Last year, Hollywood's MGM film company hired him as vice president to guide the film industry. But recently, he suddenly resigned and wants to start another large-scale film company.

Roosevelt Jr. founded his own film company, serving as general manager, using huge private capital to recruit talents and shoot new films, with the strength to compete with other companies. He is actively preparing and is expected to be ready in April this year. In his plan, there will be more than a dozen amazing blockbusters.

According to Murray Silverstone, head of United Artists, a collection of independent producers in Hollywood, he has signed a long-term contract with Roosevelt Jr. to sell his films, and the terms are the same as those of private producers who have joined United Artists, such as Charlie Chaplin, with generous profit sharing.

Roosevelt Jr.'s launch of this business has caused a great shock in the Hollywood film industry. Everyone believes that based on his past social skills, he will definitely have great achievements. MGM's previous hiring of him as vice president was just a nominal job, the purpose being to have him and the stars attend the premiere of the new film to attract attention. Now he is actually doing this business.

Roosevelt Jr. has recently been very cold with his first wife, and there is talk of divorce. Therefore, there are rumors that he is actually in love with a certain actress from United Artists, so he will take the film as his only career. There is also a saying: Old Roosevelt is also very interested in the film business.

If Old Roosevelt is not re-elected in this year's presidential election, he and his son may cooperate and promote his "New Deal" to the film industry. This is even more exciting.

### New World Creates the Royal Theater

— Travel Reporter

In the entertainment world of Shanghai, the New World Amusement Park has left us with quite strong memories. Ten years ago, in the heyday of the New World, tourists in Shanghai or those who came to Shanghai could not help but take a trip to the New World's unique "underground passage."

In recent years, the old New World has undergone many personnel changes and vicissitudes, and it has even been declining day by day. Now, Zheng Weiwei, the manager of the New World, has decided to rectify it and make a grand plan for revival.

The first plan that has already been progressed is the establishment of the "Royal Theater." Wang Dahe, Wu Liang, Zheng Weixian, Qian Youlan, Wang Yinfu, Chen Hanming and others initiated and presided over the project, building a new and complete modern theater on the open space of the racetrack. According to He's words to reporters, the Royal Palace is scheduled to open on New Year's Day. Designed by Xu Duoxia, the initial purpose of the more than 700 seats was to make Yue Opera modern and to take into consideration its development in Shanghai. Therefore, it was planned to hire Xiao Dangui as the lead actress. However, Xiao Dangui is currently in Jinhua to attend the Cold Clothes Charity Show at the request of the local county government, so she could not come to Shanghai for a while. Therefore, under the introduction of Li Wencai, a Ping Opera Troupe of Northern Girls' Class was hired and a three-month contract was signed. They will arrive in Shanghai on the 26th.

After the "Royal Palace" opens, it will not enter and exit the New World. The main entrance has been rebuilt between the "Cathay" and "Jingjing."

The creation of the Royal Theater will make the entertainment world of the "Isolated Island" lively for a while.

Luo Baisui Makes Jokes Even in Danger (Part 1)

Among the Chou [clown] actors, after Liu Gansan, Luo Baisui was the best. Baisui's name was Shoushan, and he was the son of the famous Qingyi [virtuous female role] Luo Qiaofu and the brother of the Lao Dan [elderly female role] Luo Fushan. He, Wang Guifen, and Wang Lengxian co-starred in "The Gathering of Heroes," playing Lu Su. Wang played Zhou Yu, and Luo played Jiang Gan. They were a perfect match. Every performance was a sensation. Later, Tan Xinpei, Yang Guiyun, Tian Guifeng, and others scrambled to invite him to be their right-hand man. Luo's acting was known for its cold wit. Not only was he like this on stage, but he was also as cold as ice in private. Every word and deed made people laugh. In his later years, he became more and more addicted, and his body was like a skeleton. There were many people in the know who wanted to learn from him, but because of his eccentric temperament, laziness, and illness, very few people were able to obtain Luo's true transmission. It is said that the existing old actor Ci Ruiquan did indeed obtain several excellent plays from Luo's lifetime before Luo's death. After Luo's death, Ruiquan also played with Old Tan, and after Tan pointed out and taught him, he was able to follow the rules and follow the old generation's model, which still exists. When Ruiquan was learning from Shoushan, he stayed by his side every day. He did not dare to disturb him until Luo woke up. When he woke up, he immediately knelt in front of the couch and burned cigarettes. Ruiquan was quite tall, and he always bent over for several hours, but he did not show any signs of tiredness. Luo was sincere, so he was willing to pass on his lifelong skills to him. One day, the weather was very cold, with wind and snow. Winter solstice is naturally very unfavorable to people who have been ill for a long time. Baisui had been bedridden for many days, and Ruiquan waited on him diligently, not daring to slack off. It happened that many people came to see the sick that day. Baisui was touched by the kindness of coming in the snow, so he reluctantly had people help him up and sit on the couch. Everyone asked: "How do you feel? Are you getting better soon?" He replied with a serious face: "Alas! I say the disease is not getting better." (174)
