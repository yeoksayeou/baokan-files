Editorial

### Japan's Wartime Population and Military Resources

The outcome of modern warfare hinges on two factors: spirit and material strength.

Spirit manifests itself in military morale at the front and public sentiment at the rear. Loyalty and dedication to the cause unite the military and the people. Killing the enemy and achieving victory mean relentless attacks and unwavering resolve.

Material strength encompasses three crucial elements: economy, weaponry, and manpower. A robust and self-sufficient economy is paramount, as are sophisticated and domestically produced weapons. However, the sympathy and support of friendly nations can be invaluable in securing foreign assistance. Self-reliance has its limitations, but the potential for sympathy and aid is boundless. China has long prided itself on its vast population of 480 million, and its reverence for ancestors and love for descendants. The fact that our resistance has endured without faltering only underscores the profound significance of these values. Upon learning that Finland has a population of fewer than four million, we are filled with awe and gratitude for the unique endowment of the Chinese nation! But how does Japan fare?

The Japanese spokesman remarked yesterday to foreign journalists that "the Japanese government has prohibited Japanese from coming to Shanghai because of great difficulties in troop deployment." There are frequent reports of the Japanese forcibly conscripting laborers in various parts of China, and there is a significant amount of conscription in Hongkou and the urban area of Shanghai. Dispatches from Tokyo frequently mention labor shortages. An Associated Press dispatch from Beijing yesterday stated that Japanese military authorities officially announced that they were considering transporting Chinese prisoners of war to Japan, and that they were planning to save a large number of Japanese soldiers. These glimpses of information provide a rough sketch of Japan's "human resources," without the need for detailed statistics. If this is the state of the population, one can imagine the state of the military.

According to statistics published in this year's, the latest, Asahi Yearbook, over the past decade, Japan's population increased by 800,000 to 1,030,000 annually, an average annual increase of thirteen per thousand. Up until 1937 (the 26th year of the Republic of China, the 12th year of Showa), the Japanese were able to maintain this constant rate. However, after just one year of war, the impact was widespread and drastic, with a sharp decrease in births and a sudden increase in deaths. The published statistics are as follows:

The Asahi Yearbook further states, "The number of births has decreased by 250,000, and the increase is less than 670,000, which is a negative figure since the Taisho era." It also states, "The annual increase rate was 1.3 percent, but now it is less than 1 percent." It further states, "The number of deaths has increased by about 50,000, but deaths from war are not yet included." Finally, it expresses concern: "How the war will affect the population and how to pay attention to it from the perspective of ensuring human resources," "The impact of the war is truly significant!"

But these are still statistics from the second year of the War of Resistance. What about the third year, 1939? What about this year, the fourth year? Although we have no reliable statistics to base it on, the degree of drastic impact will inevitably increase annually, according to the inevitable laws of nature. In other words, births will inevitably decrease even more sharply, and deaths will inevitably increase even more suddenly. This is an inevitable phenomenon that cannot be concealed.

Moreover, "deaths from war are not yet included." According to experts, Japan has suffered approximately 1.5 million casualties in thirty months of invading China. It is estimated that the ratio of deaths to injuries is one to four, with minor injuries and severe injuries resulting in loss of reproductive capacity each accounting for half. Then there are 300,000 deaths. The Minister of the Army, Hata Shunroku, mentioned 200,000 heroic souls when criticizing Councilman Saito. There are also 600,000 people with serious injuries and 600,000 with minor injuries. In general, the Japanese army suffers 50,000 casualties each month, or 600,000 each year. If we were to combine this with the number of births and deaths in Japan, what would the reversal be? How great would the impact be? And the war that is causing the reversal and exerting the impact is still ongoing. From this, we can further imagine how dire the state of Japan's population will be in the future, and how depleted its military resources will become.

This is not to say that Japan's military resources are already depleted. Some estimate the total number of Japanese strongmen to be 3.8 million, while others estimate it to be 4.5 million. Some estimate the number of Japanese strongmen with military training to be 2 million, while others estimate it to be 2.5 million. The number of Japanese troops in China is likely between 1 million and 1.1 million. Not all strongmen can fight, and not all those who can fight can go to the front. Given the large number of casualties and the large number of military workers and farmers needed to maintain general economic production, and given that the basic population is experiencing a sharp decline in births and a sudden increase in deaths due to the impact of the war, while we cannot say that Japan's military resources are already depleted, they are inevitably dwindling and approaching depletion. The news from Shanghai, Beijing, and Tokyo mentioned above provides strong circumstantial evidence of this. Threatening, coercing, and tempting collaborators will certainly yield some results. However, can these measures reverse the population decline, alleviate the military resource crisis, and prevent the workings of the laws of modern war?

### Rumors that Germany Intends to Reopen Negotiations - To Mediate the Sino-Japanese War - Attempts to Win Over Russia and Japan for Support - New Naval Attaché Arrives in Tokyo

Tokyo - Rear Admiral Werner Kähler, the newly appointed naval attaché to the German Embassy in Japan, arrived here yesterday to replace the former naval attaché, Colonel Lietzmann. (Haitong dispatch of the 27th)

Paris - Observers here recently said that Germany is trying to mediate between Finland and Russia on the one hand, and advising Japan to end the "China Incident" as soon as possible on the other. Germany clearly needs the support of both Japan and Russia in the current war, but it cannot obtain their assistance unless these countries separately cease military operations. Regarding the Sino-Japanese problem, the German government has appointed Rear Admiral Werner Kähler as naval attaché to the Japanese embassy. This is intended to explore the wishes of the Japanese side. Germany has previously attempted to mediate between China and Japan, and although it was not successful at the time, the country has not abandoned this plan. Therefore, it now intends to reopen negotiations. It is said that Rear Admiral Werner Kähler will also work with German economic experts in Tokyo, including Herr Friedrich, Chairman of the Hamburg America Line, to try to win over Russia and Japan. However, Japan has always been extremely secretive about foreign affairs, and it is difficult to know what stage this matter has reached. (Havas dispatch of the 26th)

### Finance Minister Sakurauchi Explains - Japan's Financial Plan - Impoverishing the People to Make Ends Meet - Hoping to Cope with Huge Budget

Tokyo - Japan's huge budget for next year, amounting to 1,300,000,000 yen, has now been submitted to the House of Peers. When questioned by the House of Representatives, Finance Minister Sakurauchi replied that because the future of the China Incident is still unclear, the Japanese government does not expect its expenditures to decrease and that they may even increase, because Japan must invest in the economic development of China. As things stand, it is difficult to make accurate comments on plans to cope with the financial situation. The relevant administrative provinces are considering supplementing the budget and issuing government bonds to make up for the shortfall, which will soon be submitted to the meeting. The disposal of special items for extraordinary military expenses must be considered based on the situation in which Japan can cooperate with China after the establishment of the New Political Regime in China. For example, should the expenses of troops stationed in China in the future be paid from this special item? If the New Political Regime in China makes complete progress and can maintain law and order and pay attention to its national defense, Japan will not need to provide assistance. However, assistance from Japan is essential during the transition period, so Japan's national expenditures cannot be easily reduced. In addition to assisting in maintaining law and order and national defense, Japan must also make large investments in the economic development of China, so expenditures in China will not decrease even when extraordinary expenses are transferred to regular items. Japan's tax revenue has been increasing naturally year after year, and this increase depends on the actual situation in the economic sector, so it is impossible to make general comments on this point. However, it is believed that tax revenue will gradually increase as Japan's economy expands. Since the outbreak of the China Incident, pension payments have been increasing day by day, and the amount of government bonds has also increased, and it will only increase in the future. In this situation, it will be difficult to cope with the gradually increasing expenses with only the natural increase in tax revenue. The budget proposal for the 1941-1942 fiscal year is not yet under consideration, but it is believed that when preparing this budget, the basic unit of commodity prices must be considered. When councilors inquired about the government's plan to deal with the accumulating government debt, Finance Minister Sakurauchi replied that if there is an appropriate plan to repay the government debt, and the funds obtained from issuing bonds are used for productive economic benefits, then deficit government bonds will not harm the national economy. Government deficit bonds issued to cover national defense expenditures will ultimately help the development of heavy industry and eliminate the need for the country to import various goods, which is a harmonious result. This theory also applies to industries in peacetime. The expenses of expanding industrial production also produce favorable results in terms of finance, because the reduction of imports will result in economic prosperity and a natural increase in tax revenue.

### Japan's Finances - Are Strained - Plans to Issue Small-Denomination Lottery Tickets - To Plunder People's Wealth

Tokyo - Finance Minister Sakurauchi is currently preparing to submit a concrete proposal to the Diet regarding the prevention of currency inflation, as has been stated repeatedly. The Finance Minister is considering selling a type of small-denomination 2-yen bond with a prize attached in order to absorb capital. He has ordered the Bureau of Affairs to conduct a survey and study, and a plan will be drawn up and submitted to the Diet soon. The main points of the proposal are as follows: (1) Name: Patriotic Stamp Bonds (tentative name); (2) The goal is to sell to the general public, with a total amount of approximately 500 million yuan and a ticket price of 1 to 2 yuan; (3) Those who purchase the bonds will be given a prize of several dozen to several hundred times the value by lottery; (4) Bonds that do not win the lottery will be collected in groups of 10 to 20 and exchanged for bonds with a face value of 10 to 40 yuan at post offices or savings banks; (5) Prizes of several dozen to several hundred times the value will also be given to these bonds by lottery; (6) All prizes will be made long-term savings deposits in the name of the winners and will be repaid after the term expires; (7) Bonds will be sold not only at post offices, but also at cigarette shops, department stores, and other places easily accessible to the public.

### Japan's Price Maintenance - Policy is Contradictory - Will Spark Heated Debate in the Diet

Tokyo - Commerce Minister Fujiwara's statement in the House of Representatives yesterday afternoon that the official price limits for certain goods must be raised in order to increase production and eliminate black market transactions has been published in all the morning newspapers here today and is regarded as important news. The newspapers say that the dual policy of maintaining low prices on the one hand and increasing production on the other is contradictory, and this is now evident, so the government's low-price policy will be greatly revised. The Asahi Shimbun predicts that the Commerce Minister's statement will cause disputes, and the debate on the price issue in the Diet will become more激昂. (Reuters dispatch of the 27th)

### Saito Disciplinary Case - Turmoil is Expanding - Japanese Government Watches Developments - And Prepares to Order Suspension of the Diet

Tokyo - The Saito incident continues to occupy an important position in Japanese domestic politics. On Saturday and Sunday, Saito attended the Diet's Disciplinary Committee and questioned the Konoe Declaration, which the government is currently relying on to end the China Incident. The rift between those who demanded Saito's expulsion and those who opposed it widened. Although the government temporarily does not want to interfere in this matter, it has expressed to political parties its opinion that the punishment of Saito should not be lenient. The attitude of the army and navy is said to have been strengthened, but they are very concerned about the final outcome of this matter. The cabinet is now watching the developments. If the party leaders cannot promote unity of action and quickly resolve this matter, they intend to order the suspension of the Diet. (Reuters dispatch of the 27th)

Tokyo - Tazawa, chairman of the Japanese Youth League, spoke in the House of Peers today and urged the government to announce its policy on the Saito case in order to avoid unfortunate misunderstandings (applause). Tazawa also mentioned reports in newspapers about the government's consideration of suspending the Diet, which gave the general public the impression that the government was intimidating the Diet. In response, Prime Minister Yonai said emphatically that the government had no intention of interfering in the affairs of the Diet. (Reuters dispatch of the 27th)

### Incident of the Bombing of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway - French-Japanese Negotiations

Tokyo - French Ambassador Henri visited Japanese Vice Foreign Minister Tani Masayuki this afternoon to exchange views on the Japanese air raid on the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway. (Reuter, 27th)

Tokyo - The semi-official Japanese newspaper "The Japan Times" stated today: "If France can recognize Japan's military position in China and conduct negotiations with Japan on that principle, Japan can compensate France for all losses suffered from the Japanese bombing of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway under reasonable and legal principles." The newspaper continued, "Until now, France has failed to recognize Japan's position in China. On the contrary, France is now mentioning the issue of the Japanese occupation of the Xisha Islands and Hainan Island. Japan believes that since France has shifted diplomatic talks to this issue, there is no possibility of understanding between the two sides." The newspaper stated, "The Xisha Islands are part of the territory of the Japanese Empire, and Hainan Island is occupied by the Japanese army because of its military value. The current negotiations between Japan and France cannot be considered satisfactory. The positions of the two sides are too far apart. Before the positions of the two sides converge, there is no possibility of understanding between Japan and France. This situation is by no means what Japan wants to see, because the war in southwestern China will continue. France is currently preoccupied with the war in Europe. It is doubtful whether it can handle Far Eastern issues in this way." (United Press, 27th)

### American Reporter Young to be Tried - Accused of Military Law Offenses

Rome - US Undersecretary of State Welles, after meeting with Mussolini and Foreign Minister Ciano yesterday, met with British Ambassador to Italy Sir Loraine today. Welles then hosted a banquet for the British and French ambassadors at the US embassy. (Reuter, 27th)

Bern, Switzerland - According to reliable sources, US Undersecretary of State Welles is scheduled to arrive in Berlin on March 1st and is expected to stay for three days. He will first visit Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, and then, accompanied by him, meet with Führer Hitler to hold talks. He will also talk with German Aviation Minister Goering before leaving Berlin. In addition, it is said that Führer Hitler will host a grand banquet at the New Chancellery to entertain him. (Havas, 27th)

London - Italian sources have taken a lukewarm attitude towards US Undersecretary of State Welles' visit to Rome as President Roosevelt's envoy to Europe. However, after Welles' meeting with Mussolini and Foreign Minister Ciano last night, there was a sudden shift to a more positive attitude. Foreign Minister Ciano immediately rushed to the Palazzo Venezia to report the main points of the talks to Mussolini for half an hour. Prior to yesterday's meeting, the political circles in Rome did not attach importance to Welles' visit, regarding it as a strategy for President Roosevelt's own election. The Roman press also viewed it with indifference. However, last night, those in charge felt that the significance of Welles' trip was greater than previously anticipated. Concrete results may emerge after Welles returns to the United States in the future. Although official circles in Italy are currently silent, their attitude has indeed improved, which is very different from the attitude they held when President Roosevelt issued his peace appeal last time. However, Welles' tour of Europe is purely in the capacity of a private interviewer for the US President, without the power to propose anything to any party. This has been stated earlier. (Reuter, 27th)

Washington - Diplomatic sources here recently stated that the documents that US Undersecretary of State Welles delivered to Italian Prime Minister Mussolini were a letter from President Roosevelt, which, in addition to expressing friendship, only stated that Welles was visiting Europe as the President's representative and contained no other political statements. It is said that Welles will also present President Roosevelt's letter to French Prime Minister Daladier when he travels to France in the future, but the contents of the letter are unknown.

### US Government Decides to Maintain Reciprocal Trade Policy - Believes it is the Foundation for Post-War Reconstruction of the World Economy - Hull Explains to Senate Finance Committee

Washington - The bill for the United States to continue its existing commercial treaty program for a period of three years from June 12th was passed by the House of Representatives on Friday and will be considered by the Senate this week. It is expected that the Senate will pass it by a majority of at least eight votes. Secretary of State Hull stated to the Senate Finance Committee today that the continuation of the commercial treaty program is necessary to help establish a sound situation in the post-war world. If we do not continue to maintain our leadership in promoting free trade policies and urge other countries to adopt such policies as the basis for post-war economic recovery, the future will certainly be bleak. Once the war is over, there will be an unprecedented need to greatly increase the production of various useful goods throughout the world. If there is no way to meet this need, neither the United States nor other countries can hope that the working class will have full employment and rising living standards. People in Washington are very pleased that the House has passed this bill. (Reuter, 26th)

### Economic Reconstruction and Universal Disarmament - US Seeks Opinions from Various Countries - Some Countries Respond Favorably

Washington - After Secretary of State Hull announced last month his intention to hold talks with various neutral countries, diplomatic sources recently stated that the US government has instructed its envoys to various neutral countries to submit memorandums to the governments of their respective countries, seeking opinions on the two issues of reorganizing the world economy and universal disarmament. It has now received replies from several neutral countries, all of which have expressed their support for the plan proposed by the United States. (Havas, 26th)

Average of 110,000 Barrels per Day in One Month Last September

The Hague - The German Mining Daily recently reported that the United States is still supplying Japan with large quantities of gasoline. In one month last September, an average of 110,000 barrels of gasoline per day were shipped from California to Japan. (Havas, 26th)

### Churchill Reports on British Naval Achievements - 35 German Submarines Sunk - Fearless of Mine Warfare

London - First Lord of the Admiralty Churchill recently gave a speech in the House of Commons, reporting on naval achievements and criticizing the current attitude of various neutral countries. He stated that by the end of last year, more than half of the German submarines had been lost, with a total of no less than 35 being sunk by the Allied forces, while the number of new submarines they had built was only ten. In the past two days alone, we have sunk one German submarine and damaged two. This shows that our navy has gained the upper hand in the submarine war. As for mine warfare, we are also fearless. Although Germany disregards all international laws and regulations and abuses mines to destroy the merchant shipping of various countries, the impact on us is minimal. Hundreds of ships from neutral countries have been sunk, and thousands of sailors have tragically lost their lives. Germany, having violated international laws and regulations and engaged in various acts of violence, and having gained some benefits, now demands that others abide by the international laws that it has torn up with its own hands when it deems it advantageous. Various neutral countries also echo this sentiment without distinguishing between right and wrong. This situation is not only intolerable to the British government, but I myself also find it unbearable. (Cheers from the members) I believe that in interpreting the regulations concerning neutral countries, we should not adhere to legal principles, but should be based on humanitarian concepts. This is also the common feeling of all civilized countries in the world. As for the strength of our navy, the new battleships currently being built are equipped with sophisticated air defense weapons and cannot be damaged by enemy air raids. Our battleship "Barham" was recently hit by a torpedo and can be redeployed once it is repaired. The "Nelson" also struck a magnetic mine in December last year, and it has also been repaired. In summary, since the beginning of the war, our battleships that have been sunk include the "Royal Oak" and the aircraft carrier "Courageous". Those that have been damaged include the "Barham" and the "Nelson". All other battleships and aircraft carriers are unharmed. In other words, the warships we have lost in the past six months total 63,000 tons, which is only half of the total losses in the first six months of the last European war. As for the merchant ships we have lost, they total 200,000 tons, which is less than one-tenth of our entire merchant fleet. Compared to the last World War, when we lost 450,000 tons in April 1917 alone, the difference is enormous. In conclusion, I am unwilling to predict the future of the war, but I believe that if we cannot control the seas and allow our navy to play a decisive role in the future victory, not only will I not be satisfied, but neither will the members of the House of Commons.

### British and German Aircraft Raid Berlin and Paris - Britain Announces Downing of German Aircraft

London - The Air Ministry recently issued a communiqué stating that our aircraft repeatedly flew over Heligoland Bight, the North Sea coast, and various inland cities in Germany yesterday, conducting reconnaissance flights with great success. Several aircraft flew to Berlin at night, and others flew to the Baltic Sea coast, all of which safely returned to their bases. (Havas, 27th)

Oslo - Rumors that warships from the UK and Germany had fought in the Arctic Ocean have been denied by informed sources here, who say that there has been no such incident, at least not in the northern waters of Norway. (Havas, 27th)

London - The British ship Kronprinz ran into a mine in the North Sea, killing one Indian sailor. 17 members of the crew were injured, including two senior officers, all of whom landed at a port on the east coast today. (Reuter, 27th)

### Large Quantities of Japanese Socks Allowed to be Imported into Britain - Labor MPs Question the British Authorities' Plan

London - After President of the Board of Trade Duncan expressed his views in the House of Commons today regarding the import of socks made in Japan into the UK, Labour MP Thorne said that the more trade the British do with the Japanese, the more severe the blows the Japanese inflict on China. The question was first raised by a Labour MP, who asked the President of the Board of Trade how the British government had agreed with the Japanese government to allow 150,000 dozen Japanese-made socks and large quantities of Japanese textiles to be imported into Britain. The President of the Board of Trade replied that the agreement between British and Japanese manufacturers regarding the import of Japanese socks had been in place for several years. The agreement was reviewed in January of this year, and the restrictions on import licenses were subsequently relaxed, allowing inexpensive socks made in Japan that are not manufactured in Britain to be imported into Britain, while limiting their quantity. MP Wilkinson then asked whether it was wise to allow silk stockings to be imported at a time when Britain was suffering from a large number of unemployed people and the food supply was not abundant. The President of the Board of Trade replied that export trade must also be taken into consideration. Britain had stated to the Japanese government that the continuation of this concession would depend on Japan's attitude towards allowing the import of British-made wool socks. (Reuter, 27th)

### Finland Acknowledges Abandoning Koivisto Islands - Reinforcements Deployed to Defend New Positions - Soviet Aircraft Bomb Finnish Inland Cities

Helsinki - A communiqué issued last night acknowledged that the Finnish side had abandoned the Koivisto Islands, from which Finnish artillery bombarded Soviet troops in Karelia. It stated that on February 25, Soviet troops continued their offensive in the western part of the isthmus, which was blocked by Finnish artillery and infantry. The Soviet troops suffered heavy losses. Soviet troops advancing in Salmenkaita were repelled after a day of fierce fighting. Several Soviet tanks were destroyed. There was active artillery activity in the eastern part of the isthmus yesterday, and otherwise there was calm. Soviet artillery positions fell silent after being bombarded by Finnish troops. Several surrounded Soviet units have been annihilated. Finnish troops are conducting reconnaissance and bombing behind Soviet lines and flying multiple patrols along the coast. Soviet aircraft activity is limited to attacking certain remote areas and has dropped some bombs on Hanko. However, there is still air activity in the war zone. According to confirmed reports, five Soviet aircraft have been shot down, and it is rumored that two other Soviet aircraft have also been shot down, but this has not been confirmed. It is rumored that after abandoning the Koivisto Islands, the Finnish army is preparing to withdraw from Sakkala, which is five miles from the coast and opposite Vyborg, but this may only be to evacuate civilians, because with Koivisto in the hands of the Soviet army, Sakkala is at risk of being directly bombarded. (Reuter, 27th)

Stockholm - With the Soviets in possession of Koivisto and its strong fortifications, they are increasing the pressure on the western end of the Mannerheim Line defending Vyborg. After major reinforcements, the Soviets are repeatedly attacking new Finnish positions, but fresh Finnish troops have also arrived and are holding their positions. After the Finnish victory in the Suomussalmi area, they can apparently shift part of their troops to support the southern front. But many believe the loss of Koivisto is a major blow to the Finns, as its artillery was able to inflict heavy casualties on the advancing Soviets, defend the flanks of the Mannerheim Line, prevent the Soviet fleet from approaching, and prevent them from landing troops or advancing over the ice. (Reuter, 27th)

Vyborg - According to a Finnish military commander, although the Koivisto fortress, which shields Vyborg, has been lost, the Finnish army will be able to defend Vyborg for at least several weeks. It is said that the Soviet army is now attacking the second line of defense of the Mannerheim Line. If the second line of defense is also breached, then we will have a third line of defense, and beyond that, there will be countless new lines. (United Press, 27th)

Moscow - A communiqué from the headquarters of the Leningrad Military District stated that on the Karelian front, Soviet troops continued to destroy enemy defenses. Enemy attempts to counterattack were repulsed and suffered heavy casualties. During a counterattack by a certain enemy unit, nine tanks were lost, two of which were destroyed and the other three were captured by Soviet troops. In addition to the items listed in the public announcement on the 14th, Soviet troops captured 16 fortifications on George Island, including 15 artillery positions, two secret artillery positions, four ammunition and food storage depots, 10,000 artillery shells, and 5 million rounds of ammunition. In other areas, there was no significant development. The Soviet Air Force bombed enemy troops and military targets. In air combat, the Soviet Air Force shot down 19 enemy aircraft. (TASS, 27th)

Helsinki - Air raid alarms were issued here yesterday , the first lasting three hours before being lifted, the second lasting only half an hour. In addition to being active in the war zone, Soviet aircraft flew to the inland cities of Kuovola, Lahti, Riihimäki, and Kangasala, carrying out indiscriminate bombing, but there were few casualties. (Havas, 27th)

Helsinki - Hundreds of Soviet aircraft flew to this city yesterday, many of which were shot down by Finnish anti-aircraft artillery. (Havas, 27th)

### British King Visits Eastern Scotland - Inspects the Air Force - Awards Bravery Medals to Naval Officers

London - The British King and Queen spoke last night on the pier of a port on the east coast with five British people who had been imprisoned on the German ship "Altmark". These people had endured difficult experiences, but showed no signs of exhaustion and joked about being imprisoned on this Nazi "Hell Ship". Yesterday during the day, the British King visited a shipyard in eastern Scotland and awarded bravery medals to eight naval officers. The British King wore a naval admiral's uniform. He then boarded a ship to inspect an organization where 500 trainees were receiving training as mechanics. He also visited an airfield at a naval aviation training station and inspected air force officers and soldiers, naval officers, and members of the Women's Royal Naval Service. (Reuter, 27th)

### Germany's Mediation of the Soviet-Finnish War Still Possible; Nordic Conference Prepares the Ground; British Military Aid to Finland Unlikely to Materialize

Paris – Well-informed sources here recently stated that German mediation in the Finnish-Soviet war is still possible at this point. The foreign ministers of the three Nordic countries held a meeting in Copenhagen, Denmark, expressing their desire for a swift and peaceful resolution to the Finnish-Soviet war. This is considered to be paving the way for German mediation. Germany has a direct interest in the conclusion of the Finnish-Soviet war, unlike the Scandinavian countries. Semi-official German sources are spreading rumors in the capitals of Scandinavian countries that the Soviet government is preparing to cease fire, allowing Finland to maintain its independence and territorial integrity to a large extent. However, the true intentions of the Soviet Union remain unknown. It is recalled that on November 29th of last year, U.S. President Roosevelt offered to mediate. At that time, Finland expressed acceptance, but the Soviet government rejected it. If the Soviet Union is now prepared to accept mediation, Germany may have to provide practical compensation in other areas. (Havas News Agency, 26th)

Oslo – Norwegian Foreign Minister Koht returned yesterday after attending the Nordic Conference and immediately participated in the Parliamentary Foreign Affairs Committee in the afternoon to deliver a report. (Haitong News Agency, 27th)

Amsterdam – British military writer Hart published an article in the "Sunday Express" examining the issue of aid to Finland. He mentioned that former Secretary of War Hore-Belisha and others advocated British military aid to Finland. However, from a technical standpoint, this plan is difficult to implement. If Norway and Sweden cannot cooperate, Britain and France cannot intervene in the Finnish issue, as plans to send troops to the Baltic Sea cannot be carried out. Even temporarily occupying Denmark would only shorten the voyage and not avoid sailing in the Baltic Sea. (Haitong News Agency, 27th)

### U.S.-Soviet Trade Increases; U.S. Senate Rejects Severing Ties with Soviet Union

Washington – According to statistics released by the U.S. Department of Commerce, U.S. exports to the Soviet Union increased by 59% compared to the previous year, with most of it being metals and manufactured goods. Exports to South America only increased by 46%. Political figures here claim that the increase in U.S.-Soviet trade is one of the reasons why Congress rejected the proposal to sever diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. (Haitong News Agency, 27th)

Washington – Since the Soviet Union's invasion of Finland, the U.S. Republican Party has expressed dissatisfaction with President Roosevelt's foreign policy, arguing that the President should not have recognized the Soviet Union in 1933. Senator Lodge of the Republican Party even proposed a motion to remove the $17,500 budget item for the U.S. Embassy in the Soviet Union from the State Department's budget. After deliberation, the Senate rejected this motion by a show of hands today. The Republican Party's demand for the government to recall U.S. Ambassador Steinhardt to the Soviet Union thus failed.

### 1940 New York World's Fair; 46 Countries Participating

New York – New York World's Fair President Whalen announced today that to date, 32 countries, including Britain, Czechoslovakia, and Finland, have accepted President Roosevelt's invitation to participate in this year's New York World's Fair. Another 14 countries will also accept. There will be a total of 46 countries participating in the exhibition. Last year, 61 countries participated in the fair. Although the Fair Corporation refused to provide financial assistance to Britain for participation, Britain has formally accepted the invitation to continue participating.

### Japan Plans to Monopolize Central China Business; Semi-Official Company to be Formed to Compete with Foreign Businesses

Tokyo – According to local newspapers, the Japanese government will establish a semi-official enterprise company in Central China in the near future, that is, when the lower reaches of the Yangtze River are opened. It will be named the "Central China Enterprise Company" and will be used to control various Japanese industrial and commercial firms in Central China. It is said that the motive for this move is that the industrial and commercial firms of various countries in Central China are both financially strong and have a long history. Once the Yangtze River resumes navigation, they will certainly occupy an advantageous position and cause serious damage to Japanese businesses. The Japanese authorities, in order to plan ahead, have made this proposal. Japanese banks are reportedly starting to organize a group to jointly invest in this company. The method is that the banking group will first lend 25 million Japanese yen, and then in May of this year, the "Central China Enterprise Company" will issue bonds under government guarantee, and use the proceeds to repay the loan. It is also said that the bonds will be issued at 995 per face value, with an interest rate set at 4.2% per annum. According to the Japan Times, the Japanese authorities in Central China have already taken various preliminary measures. Some important goods transported from the interior of China to the occupied areas, including Shanghai, have already been restricted or prohibited. Certain other goods will be restricted or prohibited in the near future. At the same time, some commercial firms have been established and granted special permission to buy and sell these goods, such as various ironware, copperware, tinware, coal, ramie, cotton, leather, and vegetable oils. The commercial firms that enjoy this privilege include the Japan Ironware Company, the Central China Mining Company, the Central South Coal Industry Company, the Yezhong Cotton Union Company, the Central China Cotton Export Textile Company, and the Central China Export Union Company. In addition, the Sino-Japanese joint venture Ramie Union Company is being organized. It is generally believed that although these companies enjoy the exclusive right to buy and sell the above-mentioned goods, they will still inevitably suffer serious damage in competition with Chinese and foreign merchants once the Yangtze River is opened. Therefore, it is necessary to organize a semi-official company to control various companies and cope with competition. (Havas News Agency, 26th)

### Japanese Establish Military Academy in Beiping

Beiping – The Japanese Army has established a Beiping 'West Point' (Army Officer) school here. Its purpose is to help the Japanese army govern the occupied areas and save Japanese manpower for other uses. Due to the lack of manpower in Japan, the importance of this military officer school is increasing daily. Recently, the Japanese parliament questioned the military authorities on what stable relief measures should be adopted due to the increasing shortage of labor caused by military needs. The military authorities announced that they are considering transporting Chinese prisoners of war to Japan and ordering them to work in the fields and factories, and training Chinese officers to command the puppet troops in North China, which is in line with the Japanese army's plan to order Chinese people to build a new order for Japan. Therefore, the mission of the North China 'West Point' school is to train puppet officers to command the puppet troops in the occupied areas and maintain security in the area. This plan seems to save a large number of Japanese troops to engage in actual warfare. The Chinese army barracks seven miles northwest of Beiping are now the school building of the North China 'West Point' school. The school is under the jurisdiction of Qi Xieyuan's Security Department, with Lieutenant General Wang Yongquan as the principal, but the real power is in the hands of Lieutenant Colonel Yongfeng, the staff officer of the North China Japanese Army. In addition, there are seven Japanese army officers and two Japanese language teachers as instructors at the school. The school was first established in Tongzhou and moved to its new location last October. According to Lieutenant Colonel Yongfeng, there were 1,000 students in the second semester, and another 400 applicants were rejected due to quota limitations. Students can only enter the school after passing physical and educational examinations. High school graduates are eligible to take the exam. Two-thirds of the students come from Beiping and Tianjin, and the rest come from rural areas in North China. When the school opened in Tongzhou in May 1938, the Japanese authorities advertised extensively in Chinese newspapers and posted slogans throughout the occupied areas of North China, and promoted it through the Xinminhui, setting a quota of 500 students. As a result, only 300 people were recruited. Last October, the enrollment campaign became more radical, with 1,000 applicants. The age of the students ranges from 18 to 22 years old, but according to regulations, applicants over 25 years old can also be admitted. Lieutenant Colonel Yongfeng said that in addition to young students, former puppet army officers currently employed by the Japanese army can also receive training for ten months with the recommendation of the 'Provisional Government.' The first graduates of the North China 'West Point' school will be sent to Japan for free travel before being assigned to the army for service. The first 300 graduates and many old officers who have been retrained are currently commanding 15,000 puppet troops stationed in Jinan, Baoding, Zhengding and other places. In the above-mentioned places, these puppet troops, which are the pillars of the 'New Order,' do not come into contact with the Chinese guerrillas and do not defect. However, there is little hope of using these puppet troops employed by the Japanese to replace large Japanese troops to maintain security. In order to guarantee the loyalty of the students of the North China 'West Point' school, each student must be guaranteed by two responsible persons. If a student commits any illegal act, only the guarantors will be held accountable. When the students enter the school, they wear the latest style of high-quality khaki army uniforms. Each of them has a German rifle and other items, including a kettle. The students are not supplied with ammunition because there are no target practice or live ammunition shooting courses in their curriculum. The training received by the students is Spartan. Each student has a canvas bed without springs or mattresses. The food is "abundant and simple." Each large room accommodates 50 students, with a room next to it housing four military officers whose duty is to maintain order and cleanliness. The room is clean and simply furnished, with rifles placed on a gun rack at one end of the room. Each student's personal belongings are placed on a small shelf on the canvas bed. The room is so tidy that it can be compared to the American 'West Point' school films filmed in Hollywood. In addition to providing living expenses and clothing, each student receives a monthly allowance of five Japanese yen. Lieutenant Colonel Yongfeng said that due to the great need for officers and soldiers, the training at the North China 'West Point' school is limited to one year. He admitted that the short-term training is insufficient, but extending the training period is not permitted by the current environment. The subjects of study are limited to the theory of transportation, fortifications, strategy, and drills. Due to the short time, students can only receive partial drills. All instructions are in Chinese, and Japanese teachers issue instructions through translation. The reporter visited the Japanese language class, which has 150 students. They gave brief and clear answers in fluent Japanese. However, according to the reporter's investigation, the students with good grades are seated in the front row, and all the answers are given by them. The students sitting in the back row have no interest in Japanese. One student, although wearing a lively uniform, looks no different from an average Chinese farmer. He was drawing the scenery of the Western Hills in the distance outside the window in the classroom. After graduation, the students are assigned to "pacify North China." After graduation, they can receive a salary of 50 to 60 Japanese yen according to their rank, which they rely on to make a living. Lieutenant Colonel Yongfeng said that the main task of the new army is pacification. Puppet army officers will command the puppet troops stationed along the railway lines. Part of their work is to recruit new soldiers from the people. Recently, hundreds of young people from the countryside flocked to Beiping to enlist. Lieutenant Colonel Yongfeng also said that the Japanese army does not view this new army as being able to fight against the Kuomintang's army, and the training courses do not include anti-Chiang Kai-shek political training. However, when students enter the school, they must take the following oath: "I join the army and swear to be loyal to the country and fulfill the duties of a soldier." The students do not yet know what the country is, because the authorities have not yet decided whether the new army will be under the control of Wang Jingwei when the "New Government" is organized. Lieutenant Colonel Yongfeng recently stated, "We related to the school believe that since the new army is organized to protect North China, the new army will stay in North China as usual."

### Japanese Troops Withdraw from Guangzhou; Plan to Invade Coastal Areas of Guangdong and Fujian; Over 30 Japanese Warships Sail out of the Pearl River; Fighting Continues in Gujing, Xinhui

Shantou Communication: After the news of the victory in Guinan spread, the Japanese Southern China Expeditionary Army in Guangzhou and Shantou became panicked. In the past week, Guangzhou has been under strict Japanese military control. The majority of the troops have gathered at Huangpu, Humen, and Taiping to board ships. More than 30 transport ships are anchored in the Pearl River. More than 10,000 Japanese troops stationed in the suburbs of Guangzhou, such as the troops of Zhu Qing, Guantian, Matsui, Fujimoto, and Shimizu, boarded ships at Huangpu at night and sailed to the sea. It is said that some are going to Qinzhou and Nanning to help in the battle, while others are being sent to carry out mobile attacks along the coast and rivers. Dianzhou, Liangyang, Beihai, as well as Sanbu in Zhongshan, and Haicheng, Zhangpu, and Yunxiao in southern Fujian are all targets of their mobile attacks. Recently, it has been learned that in the Xinhui battle, the two sides are in a stalemate in Gujing in the Ninth District. The Japanese troops who infiltrated the Shuangshuikou on both sides of the Yinzhuhu Lake have also made no progress. The Japanese and puppet troops attempted to attack Daliang and fierce fighting has broken out in the Longjiang area. As for the Leizhou Peninsula in southern Guangdong, news from here is unclear. In the Chaoshan area, six or seven transport ships have been loading Japanese and puppet troops, two to three thousand in total, in Shantou and Nanao for several days and sending them to southern Fujian. They landed on Dongshan Island on February 12. By the 16th, all the Japanese and puppet troops had been annihilated. Dongshan Island is still under the control of the Chinese military and civilians. On the morning of the 17th, Japanese naval aircraft covered four transport ships and returned to Yougong, Haicheng County, southern Fujian. More than 20 warships fired artillery to contain the shore-based defenders. More than 300 Japanese marines, assisted by puppet troops and a special service regiment, attempted to land by force on Baitang, Baigeng, and Qingyang in the county. The Chinese army was forced to retreat due to the pressure of aircraft and warships near the coast. The puppet police regiment and special service regiment defected to the Chinese army after advancing deep inland. More than 300 Japanese marines retreated to Baigeng. This happened on the 17th. Xiaoping and Zhelin on the Fujian border were also attacked by Japanese warships at 9:00 a.m. on the 17th. One Japanese warship sailed from Nanao towards the port of Zhelin, fired more than a dozen cannons, and sent out four armed motorboats carrying 200 Japanese soldiers. Under the cover of artillery fire, they suddenly landed. The local self-defense corps guarded the dangerous areas on the shore, waiting for the Japanese warships to approach. Seeing that there was no response from the shore, the Japanese soldiers landed on the Dasha Dam. The Chinese side, seeing that all the Japanese soldiers had left the motorboats, gave an order and the ambushes opened fire. The Japanese soldiers on Dasha Dam had nothing to cover themselves with and were all caught in the crossfire. The Japanese army was caught off guard and suffered heavy casualties. In less than half an hour of fighting, thirty to forty corpses were left on the beach. The remnants retreated to the boats and sailed to the sea. The Chinese militia captured five rifles and thousands of rounds of ammunition. On the same day, the Japanese motorboats were also repelled in their attack on Guanbu, Chaoyang.

### Medical Experts from Various Countries Gather in Chongqing to Discuss Malaria Prevention; Government Allocates 2 Million Yuan for Five-Year Malaria Prevention Program

The Mainland News reported that, according to news from yesterday (25th), medical experts from various countries will hold a meeting in Chongqing at the beginning of next month to draft a two-year program to combat malaria in Yunnan, which is funded by the Rockefeller Foundation and continues throughout the year. The experts will thoroughly investigate the causes of the disease and train the necessary personnel to carry out the work. Experts from the National Health Administration, who have been fighting in the malaria-stricken areas of Yunnan, will represent the Chinese government at the meeting. Dr. Sweet, a member of the Rockefeller Foundation and a world-renowned malaria authority, has always been in Mysore, India, and has now set off for Chongqing. After meeting with experts in Chongqing, he will lead a research team to the southwest to conduct research. Dr. Balfour, Director of the Far East Office of the International Health Department of the Rockefeller Foundation, left Shanghai by ship yesterday to go south to Chongqing to attend the meeting. Several famous Chinese doctors will cooperate with doctors from Guangdong and other experts to conduct investigations. Another expert attending the meeting is Dr. Williams. He and two other doctors came to China last autumn to conduct a preliminary investigation of infectious diseases in the southwest. Dr. Williams will soon return to the United States, but before leaving, he will transfer the results of his four-month investigation to other experts to continue their research. Dr. Balfour is expected to return to Shanghai in April after attending the meeting in Chongqing and visiting the rural laboratories in Yunnan, and then go to other places under the jurisdiction of the Foundation's Far East Office, such as Japan, Manila, and the Malay Archipelago. According to Dr. Balfour, investigators who went to the countryside have identified approximately 25 species of malaria-carrying mosquitoes in China. Investigators will start from this point to determine the relevant activities of the transmitting insects. It has been determined that some species of insects are more active than others, and that mosquitoes produced in rice fields are less harmful than other mosquitoes. Dr. Williams and his assistants' laboratory is located in Zhezhuang (transliteration) in Yunnan, and the association will generally use this place as its research site.

### Central Government Improves the Three Principles of the People Curriculum in Universities; Establishes a Research Association to Revise Curriculum Standards; Researchers Appointed by the Ministry of Education to Teach

(Chongqing Navigation News) The 130th meeting of the Standing Committee of the Central Party Headquarters passed the "Measures to Improve the Three Principles of the People Curriculum in Colleges and Universities" and requested the National Government to forward it to the Ministry of Education for compliance. The main points are as follows:

1.  The Party Ideology Course in colleges and universities will be renamed "Three Principles of the People Curriculum."
2.  The Three Principles of the People Curriculum in colleges and universities will be offered in the first and second semesters of the first academic year, with two credits per semester and two hours per week.
3.  The teaching method of the Three Principles of the People Curriculum should focus on studying various Chinese problems (such as national problems, livelihood problems, local autonomy problems, administrative organization problems, land problems, capital problems, and ethical problems) based on the principles and plans for the implementation of the Three Principles of the People (such as the Founding Strategy and the declarations and important resolutions of past representative meetings of the Party), and compare the Three Principles of the People with other ideologies on each of these problems, and summarize the conclusions in the Three Principles of the People.
4.  In order to cultivate talents for teaching the Three Principles of the People, the Ministry of Education may first organize a Three Principles of the People Teaching Research Association to identify comrades who have graduated from domestic and foreign universities and have taught in colleges and universities (including those who have passed the assessment and current Party Ideology teachers) to participate in the research, and the Ministry of Education will hire comrades who have rich research on the Three Principles of the People to guide them.
5.  The Research Association in the preceding article should, based on the teaching principles stipulated in Article 3, prepare an outline for teaching the Three Principles of the People. After being approved by the instructor, it will be used as the standard for the Three Principles of the People Curriculum. The Research Association may also divide into groups to prepare teaching materials according to this standard. The Research Association should also collect teaching materials and periodically print and distribute them to teachers for teaching purposes.
6.  The teachers of the Three Principles of the People Curriculum in each school will be selected by the Ministry of Education from the members of the Research Association in Article 4 and appointed by the schools.
7.  The teachers of the Three Principles of the People Curriculum in each school will receive the same treatment as other full-time professors and should also serve as counselors. When necessary, the Ministry of Education may provide appropriate subsidies for their teaching salaries.
8.  In order to instill the theory of the Three Principles of the People into students in the second, third, and fourth grades, the Ministry of Education may establish lectures on political, economic, and social courses in each school, and the methods will be determined separately.
9.  These measures will be implemented after being approved by the Central Executive Committee.

### Schools Concurrently Run Social Education; Ministry of Education Issues Subsidies; 10,000 Yuan Issued to Ten Provinces and Cities

(Chongqing, 27th) The Ministry of Education attaches great importance to the concurrent running of social education by schools, so it has been very effective since its implementation. Now, according to the reports of supervisors at all levels, the Ministry has given subsidies to the schools that have achieved excellent results in running social education to encourage them. It is learned that the first batch of schools approved for rewards includes elementary and secondary schools in ten provinces and cities, including Zhejiang, Guizhou, Sichuan, Bohai, Hebei, Hunan, Hubei, Ningxia, Xikang, and Chongqing, and a total of 10,000 yuan in subsidies has been issued. Other provinces and public and private colleges and universities are also being inspected and assessed and will be handled separately in succession.

### Guangdong Cultural Relics Exhibition Opens

Chairman Ye Gongchuo and Wu Tiecheng Cut the Ribbon; Holding this Exhibition During a Time of National Crisis is of Profound Significance

(Hong Kong Communication) The Guangdong Cultural Relics Exhibition, organized by the Chinese Cultural Promotion Association, was held at the Fung Ping Shan Library on Bonham Road. It opened at 9:00 a.m. on the 22nd of this month. More than 100 people attended, including Foreign Minister Wu Tiecheng, Ye Gongchuo, Zhang Fa-kui, Gao Jianwen, Yu Hongjun, Chen Bingquan, Chen Gongzhe, Jian Youwen, Sun Zhongying, Gao Tingzi, Zhao Haogong, Lu Danlin, Huang Bore, Tang Tianru, Huang Cibo, and Wang Tang. Chairman Ye Gongchuo and Wu Tiecheng presided over the opening ceremony. It opened for public viewing at 11:00 a.m. It is learned that there are many exhibits at this exhibition, a dazzling array, and the beauty is beyond description. Most of them are calligraphy and paintings by famous people, manuscripts, and writings. Therefore, it is impossible to see them all in a few days. Among them, there are many rare treasures, such as the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom part, including the Zizheng Xinbian, the Imperial Military Reality Record, Taiping Tianguo Tianli Yaolun, and the Zhu Yao檄文, exhibited by Jian Youwen. The originals, which have been lost in China, are now in the British Museum. What is displayed this time is the photographs Jian brought back from England, which are very precious. The revolutionary relics section includes the oath of the Premier of the Chinese Revolutionary Party, exhibited by Lu Danlin, with the Premier's fingerprints on it, as well as the confession of the martyr Shi Jianru's elder brother, who was captured by the Qing government and interrogated on September 13th in the 26th year of Guangxu, with his handprint on it. These are all documents related to the revolution. As for the antiques, such as the prehistoric artifacts discovered by Chen Gongzhe in Hong Kong, and the three pieces of boxwood carvings discovered in the tomb of the King of Nanyue in Guangzhou, are of great value in historical research. In addition, the completeness of various documents and utensils of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom is also a characteristic of this exhibition.

### Wu Shaoshu Talks About the Shanghai Student Federation

Dissolved Long Ago Due to Unsound Organization

(Hong Kong, 27th) Wu Shaoshu, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters and Chief of the Shanghai Branch of the Three Principles of the People Youth League, issued a statement, saying that the Shanghai Student Federation was dissolved long ago because of its complex elements and unsound organization. Recently, a small number of elements have attempted to use the name of the Student Federation to use their consistent tricks of threats and inducements to carry out activities in various schools. They deceive the pure youth with their methods and use ambiguous tones to achieve their conspiracy of passing off fish eyes as pearls. They do not say obey the President, but obey the leader; they do not say resist until the end, but struggle until the end. Things like this are endless. He is deeply afraid that the students will be confused by them, so he especially thoroughly exposes them, hoping that the students will pay close attention and not be fooled. If there are still those who are obsessed, they should be exposed at any time.

### General Situation of Wuhan University

(III)

(IV) The College of Engineering was established in the eighteenth year. Initially, it had only the Department of Civil Engineering. Subsequently, recruitment was gradually increased. By the end of the twenty-sixth year, there were six classes of graduating students. At the beginning of the twenty-second year, the Department of Mechanical Engineering was added, and one class of freshmen in Mechanical Engineering was recruited. Currently, there are two classes of graduating students. At the beginning of the twenty-fourth year, the Department of Electrical Engineering was added, and one class of freshmen in Electrical Engineering was recruited. These students will graduate at the end of this year. This year, following the Ministry's order, the Department of Mining and Metallurgical Engineering was added, recruiting a new class of freshmen. In total, the college now has four departments and three grades. It is expected that by the thirty-first year, it will increase to sixteen grades. The curriculum set by the college emphasizes both theory and practice, aiming to cultivate specialized industrial talents. In the past nine years, efforts have been made to purchase basic books for each department and new publications such as journals from engineering societies of various countries. At the same time, the college has actively planned and strived to improve the facilities of factories and laboratories. Regarding the facilities of factories and laboratories, by the end of the fifteenth year, the Materials Testing Laboratory, Thermal Power Laboratory, Hydraulic Laboratory, Road Materials Testing Laboratory, Electrical Laboratory, Power Room (including diesel engine power plant and steam turbine power plant), Surveying Instrument Room, and Machine Work, Model Work, Forging, and Foundry workshops were completed. Each can accommodate more than two hundred students for practical training simultaneously. Metallographic Laboratory and Hydraulic Engineering Research Institute, etc., are also being established and expanded separately. Since the beginning of the sixteenth year, the July 7th Incident (Marco Polo Bridge Incident) occurred, which affected the expansion plan and made it impossible to proceed actively. During the winter vacation of that year, the school moved to Sichuan. All instruments and machines in the laboratories and factories, except for large items that could not be moved and were properly stored in appropriate locations, were transported to Sichuan Province. Even the various equipment ordered in the twenty-fifth year, which had not yet arrived due to transportation issues, is being negotiated for transport. Currently, construction of buildings is actively underway. It is expected that new factories and new laboratories can be established within this year, sufficient for students' experiments and practical training. In addition, a Telecommunications Laboratory and a Mining and Metallurgical Laboratory have been added, which are newly established after the relocation.

In the twenty-fourth year, the college established the Engineering Research Institute, aiming to conduct more in-depth exploration of engineering theory and technical problems. Initially, it established a Department of Civil Engineering, and then planned to expand to Mechanical and Electrical Engineering. The Department of Civil Engineering is divided into two sections: Structural Engineering and Hydraulic Engineering. This year, a section of Hydraulic Machinery has been added, now totaling three sections, with emphasis on the research of hydraulic engineering and hydraulic machinery, in order to suit the actual needs of Sichuan Province. Recruitment has been carried out for research purposes. According to the statistics of students enrolled in the twenty-seventh year, there are currently 327 students, including eight female students (115 in the Department of Civil Engineering, 108 in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, 79 in the Department of Electrical Engineering, and 25 in the Department of Mineralogy).

### French Consulate General Publishes Articles of Association of the Valuation Committee: Violations Will Be Punished with a Fine of 1,000 Yuan; The Director of the Police Department Is Responsible for Enforcement; A Meeting Will Be Held Tomorrow to Prepare for the Proceedings

The Valuation Committee, organized by the French Consul General in Shanghai, prominent businessmen in the Settlement, and senior officials of the Municipal Council, will hold a meeting at 5:30 p.m. this Thursday at the French Municipal Council to discuss new prices. There were rumors that the meeting was held on the 26th. Senior officials of the French Consulate General denied this, saying that no meeting had actually been convened. This Thursday's meeting will be the first collective discussion, at which time they will consider "the work steps we should take." The list of members consists of 20 people, 16 of whom are foreigners and 4 are Chinese. The Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession will also consider the steps to be taken after the Municipal Council.

### The Issue of Road Construction Beyond the Boundary Will Be Negotiated Again

The North China Daily News reports that regarding the issue of road construction beyond the boundary, "Shanghai Mayor" Chuan Xiaohu told reporters yesterday (the 26th) morning that the Shanghai Municipal Council and the "Shanghai Municipal Government" will hold consultations in the very near future. The harmony and friendship before the signing of the agreement on police affairs for road construction beyond the boundary proves that continued talks can be successful. However, he declined to disclose the demands he will make to the Shanghai Municipal Council. When asked whether opium dens in the road construction area beyond the boundary will be ordered to close, as gambling dens are, Fu replied that he believed it was possible.

### Citizens Express Dissent Over the Shanghai Municipal Council's Tax Increase; They All Believe It Will Accelerate the Collapse of the Market; Wasteful Policies Must Be Considered First

Since the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession announced that it plans to increase the general municipal tax, special property tax, and land tax by 50% from July 1st of this year, residents in the Settlement have unanimously expressed their fear of severe taxation. They all believe that this measure of draining the pond to catch all the fish by the Municipal Council will definitely accelerate the collapse of the market. Because prices are high for everything, the absolute majority of citizens have difficulty maintaining even the minimum standard of living. If taxes are increased again, it will inevitably stimulate prices and continue to soar, and rents will also increase accordingly.

Reasons for the Tax Increase

Contrary to the Facts: The Municipal Council claims that the market is currently improving and the living conditions of citizens are better than in previous years, and that the majority of employees have increased their salaries and cost-of-living allowances, but this is not true. The majority of citizens are threatened by high prices, making it impossible for them to maintain their survival. Although the working class has some cost-of-living allowances, it is a drop in the bucket and cannot compensate for the high rise in prices. Moreover, the salary increase movement is not universal at all. All sectors hope that the Municipal Council will not rush to increase taxes in this time of economic depression, but must try to save as much as possible in terms of expenditure.

Treatment is Rare

The Ta Kung Pao's editorial on the 27th criticized the Municipal Council's plan to increase taxes, stating briefly that the Municipal Council had previously estimated its revenue for 1938 to be 25,908,680 yuan, while the amount spent on employee salaries, foreign exchange allowances, long-term holiday allowances, and pensions exceeded 18,000,000 yuan. It is extremely rare for a commercial company to spend 69% of its total revenue on employee salaries and allowances. The current financial difficulties of the Municipal Council are the natural result of the Council's short-sightedness and excessive wasteful policies, and cannot be avoided. If savings are to be sought, taxpayers must first consider the salaries, foreign exchange allowances, and other items of the Council's employees.

### Assassination in Hua'e Lane Yesterday Morning: Liu Zhongying Was Shot Dead; Both Bullets Hit Vital Spots and Could Not Be Treated; The Police Station Is Investigating the Cause of the Murder

An assassination by shooting suddenly occurred at 9:10 yesterday morning in Hua'e Lane, Jiujiang Road (Hubei Road Dajin Street Intersection), Public Concession. The victim was Liu Zhongying from Ningbo, who was shot twice, injuring vital spots. He died in the hospital at 5:20 p.m. One accomplice was arrested at the time, and a live ammunition pistol was seized. They were taken to the police station for questioning. The details are as follows:

Serving in the Business Community, Residing in Hua'e Lane

Liu Zhongying, a native of Ningbo, is 42 years old and serves in the business community. He participates in various group activities in Shanghai and serves as an executive committee member of the Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers' Association, an executive committee member of the First Special District Citizens' Federation, and the general director of the Citizens' Group of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association. He also manages the Shanghai New Market on Jing'an Temple Road. Last year, he founded the Daya Broadcasting Station at No. 545 Huaman Lane, Jiujiang Road, and lived in the broadcasting station with his children and wife. He usually uses a gray private car for transportation.

Shot on the Way to the Yude Bathhouse

Yesterday morning at 9:00, Liu, wearing a dark gray suit, a black woolen overcoat, and crystal glasses, took a private car to the Yude Bathhouse on Zhejiang Road, Nanjing Road. Because the bathhouse was sold out last year, the former manager Ge Futian resigned, and Liu took over. Yesterday happened to be the auspicious day of the new opening after the sale. Unexpectedly, Liu's car had only left the house a few steps, at the door of No. 555, and had not yet come out. Suddenly, two men ambushed there and opened fire upon seeing Liu, firing five shots in a row. One bullet hit Liu's throat on the left side, and one hit Liu's chest. He immediately fell under the car, bleeding profusely and unconscious.

Police Search and Capture One Suspect

After the incident, the police arrived after receiving the news and rushed Liu to Renji Hospital. At the same time, the police immediately dispatched a large number of detectives to the scene to search. As a result, a suspect was found on the Hankou Road side of Dajin Street, named Xiao Youming. A lotus-patterned pistol was confiscated, with the chamber full of bullets. In addition, five bullets were found in the bag. He is currently being questioned in detail. At the same time, an ambulance was quickly called to the scene and Liu was rushed to Renji Hospital.

Injured in Vital Spots, Died Without Treatment

After examination by the doctor, Liu's throat and lungs were hit, the wounds were in vital spots, and there was excessive bleeding. Breathing was weak and the situation was very serious. It was not convenient to perform surgery immediately, so the staff was ordered to send Liu to a temporary ward for the time being to observe his dangerous condition. At 1:30 p.m., the symptoms were the same as before. Then the doctor performed surgery to try to remove the bullet from the lungs. After a while, Liu died due to his serious injuries, became unconscious, and could not speak. He died at 5:10.

The Cause of the Assassination Is Not Political

As for the reason why Liu was suddenly assassinated this time, there are various rumors, some saying that it was related to the internal sale of the Yude Bathhouse, and it does not seem to be related to politics. The police are currently investigating the arrested suspect and the pistol shells separately, and the case will not be difficult to find out.

### Disorder at the Gap in North Jiangxi Road

Since the North Suzhou Road entrance of North Jiangxi Road was blocked by the Japanese, residents entering and leaving were forced to take a detour. The gap in the barbed wire at the intersection of North Jiangxi Road and Wenshi Road is extremely chaotic due to the sudden influx of residents. Yesterday, the Japanese sentries at that location were also extremely harsh on residents passing through. Moreover, the street there is not wide, and pedestrians are congested, making traffic extremely inconvenient.

### The Salvation Army Receives Donations from Guangdong Middle School

Salvation Army Major Morley told reporters that last week was the second time this year to collect donations. Most of these donations come from the Chinese side. There are dozens of donations of 200 yuan and 100 yuan each. Students from Guangdong Middle School Junior High School generously donated 100 yuan. The total amount of donations yesterday exceeded 105,000 yuan, not including the 10,000 yuan received last time. There are several donations of 1,000 yuan each. Morley expressed his admiration for the Chinese who enthusiastically supported this righteous cause. If there are donations from all sectors of China and abroad, they can be sent to the army headquarters at No. 4000 Sassoon House.

### Japanese Narrow-Mindedly Criticize Sassoon; Sassoon Says the Japanese People Will Resist the Military; The Japanese Embassy Spokesperson Is Therefore Very Dissatisfied

The North China Daily News reports that Sir Sassoon, a Shanghai financier currently traveling in the United States, gave a speech to reporters in New York on the 25th of this month, in which he said that the Japanese people are increasingly dissatisfied and will soon revolt against the military, and that Japan's domestic economy is heading towards collapse. The day when they seek any peace, only to maintain their face, is near. Regarding this news, the Japanese Embassy spokesperson severely criticized Sir Sassoon when hosting reporters yesterday (the 26th). According to him, these remarks, if not misreported, are actually a serious defamation of the Japanese army and Japan and its people. In the eyes of the Japanese people, Sassoon is just a Jew. Shanghai's Japanese authorities have studied the Jewish refugee issue, which is unrelated to them, and have given them great convenience. Now that they hear these words, they cannot help but regret it. The Japanese authorities restrict Japanese people from coming to Shanghai because they do not have enough space, but for humanitarian reasons, they allow as many Jewish refugees as possible to come to Shanghai and live in peace. Unexpectedly, this attitude of the Japanese authorities has not been appreciated by at least one of the Jews, which is truly regrettable. Moreover, when Sassoon arrived in San Francisco on January 31, he also made statements such as the lack of unity in Japanese public opinion. It is important to know that major events such as the current war will inevitably have economic repercussions and internal differences of opinion. As for the United States' "New Deal" plan and the countries' attitude towards the current situation in Europe, there are differences of opinion. Therefore, observers must be familiar with the national conditions of Japan in order to judge the Chinese problem, otherwise, misunderstandings are inevitable. When asked whether Sir Sassoon would be arrested if he landed in Japan, given that American reporter Yang Ge had been arrested for making statements about Japan in China, the spokesperson replied that this matter had not been considered yet.

### Organizing Coal Briquette Sales at a Discount; Each 2.4 Catty for Two Jiao, totaling Five Yuan Per Dan; Sales to Commence on March 1st, Limited to 1,000 Dan; The Method is Excellent, But We Hope it Will be Handled Permanently.

The Shanghai Municipal Machine-Made Coal Briquette Trade Association held a joint meeting of representatives from various factories yesterday, with representatives from Yitai Xing, Nanyang, Guohua, and other factories, totaling over ten people, in attendance. Chairman Chen Cuifang first reported the purpose of the meeting, and then discussions began. As a result of the discussions, it was decided to take into account the livelihoods of ordinary people and organize discounted coal briquette sales. It was decided that from March 1st to the 20th, for a period of 20 days, a total of 20,000 dan (1,000 tons) of coal briquettes would be sold at a discount, with each person limited to one jiao, and each 2.4 catty sold for two jiao, totaling five yuan per dan. The discount sales would be held daily from 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM, until the 1,000 dan were sold out. The factories present at the meeting determined the coal briquettes to be sold at a discount. As for the locations for the discount sales, they have already been decided internally and will be announced today.

Stack Order Issues

The Shanghai Coal Trade Association held its 92nd executive committee meeting at its clubhouse on Tianjin Road at 3:00 PM yesterday. Chairman Mao Chun immediately began discussions on the following matters: (1) Regarding the letter from Mao and other coal companies requesting the handling of coal briquette stack order registration and negotiations with the Coal Briquette Association, etc., these should be settled one after another, and the original price should not be recovered, and the supply should be at the lowest possible price. At the meeting, Lu Jilin, Yan Yinfang, and others requested (1) that the issue of clearing the coal briquette stack orders within ten days be referred to the Coal Briquette Association for cancellation, and that exemptions be granted within the deadline. (2) That they should be supplied for flat sales as much as possible, according to the factory disk of 110 yuan. It was decided that Lu Qisheng would be publicly recommended to negotiate with the Machine-Made Coal Briquette Association, together with member representative Yan Yinfang, and that members would be notified to register their coal briquette stack orders with the association, with a deadline of one week from the date of the announcement. (2) Regarding the Chamber of Commerce requesting the nomination of three representatives to attend the meeting for the purpose of cheap coal briquettes, it was decided that Wei Zhidai, Bao Zhexian, and Lu Sheng would be nominated as representatives. The meeting adjourned at approximately 6:00 PM.

Retail Issues

The Shanghai Coal and Firewood Trade Association sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating, "We respectfully inform you that because various coal briquette factories have stopped supplying spot goods, the small coal and firewood shops have no goods to sell. We sent a letter requesting your esteemed association to ask the factories to supply spot coal briquettes. We received your reply, informing us that you have forwarded the letter to the Machine-Made Coal Briquette Trade Association, notifying the industry to properly allocate goods during the afternoon spot purchase transactions, in accordance with the original agreement. We are very grateful for your letter of the 14th, Pu Zi No. 9867. However, recently, various small coal and firewood shops have requested to purchase spot coal briquettes, but the factories

have no goods in stock

and only allow delivery of goods with stack orders. We have received reports from our members and are aware of this situation, and the advertisements published in the newspapers by the factories on the 21st also state that the delivery of goods is entirely for the needs of stack order goods. Their claims and the facts are the same, showing that the factories are unwilling to supply spot coal briquettes at a flat price. In the relief measures, there is a proposal to sell spot goods in the afternoon, which means that both stack order withdrawals and spot supply are taken into consideration. It shows the comprehensive planning of the benevolent people who are enthusiastic about relief. However, the factories are now stopping the supply of spot goods and only supplying goods for stack order withdrawals, which is

a violation of their own agreement and not the original intention of those who are enthusiastic about relief. This is one point. The members of our association are all small coal and firewood shops, as briefly described in the previous letter. These small coal and firewood shops are located everywhere, with as many as two or three thousand shops throughout the city, specializing in retail transactions of small quantities of coal and firewood to supply fuel to nearby poor households. Their scope is small, their capital is meager, and their inventory is also small. They are different from the large capital operators in the same industry, and there is a difference between large and small businesses. The organization of the groups is also different, including the Coal Trade Association, the Firewood and Charcoal Trade Association, and the Coal and Firewood Trade Association. Those belonging to the Coal and Firewood Trade are called large businesses, while the Coal and Firewood Trade Association is the small business. Large businesses operate as agents for buying and selling on behalf of customers, and their coal briquettes are sold in large quantities, mostly through stack order transactions. Small businesses have little capital and sell coal briquettes as they are purchased. Whether it is a stack order or a spot purchase, they usually do not have the ability to purchase and store large quantities. Therefore, in recent days, a small amount of inventory has been sold out, and the factories have not provided spot assistance. The source has been exhausted, and the opportunity for survival has been cut off. The

suffering is that tens of thousands of poor households in the city

have no way to purchase fuel. The factories' cessation of spot supply is the main cause of this panic, and the result is that thousands of small coal and firewood shops are suffering great losses in their business, and hundreds of thousands of poor households have no way to cook. This is the second point. I believe that there is no shortage of sympathy for the relief of the market situation. Although the members of our association are small, most of them are unwilling to fall behind. If they can support themselves, they still try to supply spot coal briquettes to the stores in addition to selling firewood. They all still

first buy stack orders from their colleagues to get the goods, and then sell them at a flat price. Their painful sacrifice is originally to help the nearby poor households and to respond to the needs of their patrons, in order to maintain their livelihoods in the future. However, it is like taking flesh to heal wounds, increasing the pain to themselves, and it is not a long-term solution. In summary, the factories' cessation of spot supply violates the original agreement and

presents a more alarming picture for civilian fuel

and is inconsistent with the original intention of coal briquette relief. Your esteemed association leads the merchants and cares about the difficulties of the times. We sincerely ask you to discuss with the coal briquette industry to change the biased aspects of the original plan in order to adjust it, and to earnestly persuade the factories to issue spot goods to the small coal and firewood shops to supply actual sales, benefit the poor, and we look forward to your reply.

### British Soldiers Arrest Bandits on Crescent Moon Road in Western Shanghai; A Total of Fourteen People Were Arrested and Held in the British Barracks; Japanese Military Police Demanded the Return of the Weapons, But Were Unsuccessful.

The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reports that British troops arrested fourteen bandits in the western part of Shanghai early this morning (the 27th), and seized a considerable number of pistols and bullets. They are currently being held in custody. The details are as follows: A British military patrol was conducting a routine patrol to

Crescent Moon Road at around 9:20 this morning when two bandits wearing green uniforms and carrying Mauser rifles suddenly took refuge in a street next to the road. The British soldiers immediately took swift action, catching the two off guard, arresting them, and disarming them. Not satisfied with this, the British soldiers decided to continue the search and ordered two Chinese to lead them to their headquarters. The British soldiers followed with rifles and machine guns, arriving at an outpost a short distance away. The British soldiers immediately took up key positions and ordered the people inside the house to come out. There were no fewer than twelve people in total. The British soldiers then searched the house and seized several pistols and some bullets. A few minutes later, Japanese military police arrived at the scene and demanded that the British soldiers return the weapons, but they did not demand that the arrested persons be detained.

After some discussion, the Japanese military police did not object to the British troops taking the seized pistols and bullets away, as the soldiers were acting in their own defense zone. Subsequently, several British military trucks arrived and took all fourteen bandits and their weapons to the British barracks and detained them.

### Standards for Direct Sailings to Ningbo;

Twelve Feet Draft as the Standard; Only the Gaodeng Meets the Standard

After special permission was granted for Shanghai-Ningbo voyages, five foreign ships applied for registration: the "Hana" of the German Far East Company, the "Baoli" of the Italian Yihua Foreign Firm, the "Ruita" of the Norwegian Hualun Foreign Firm, the "Haifu" of the German Lihe Foreign Firm, and the "Gaodeng" of the German Lulin Foreign Firm. After receiving the reports, the highest authorities in Zhejiang Province believed that it was necessary and allowed the ships to proceed. Therefore, all the ships were preparing to implement this. According to shipping industry news yesterday, the Ningbo Shipping Administration Office believed that the Zhenhai Estuary was winding, and the larger ships with deeper drafts had difficulty entering and exiting. Therefore, the office stipulated that ships entering the blockade line should have a draft of twelve feet. Those exceeding this limit would only be allowed to anchor outside the estuary. According to the regulations, the draft limits of the above five ships were measured one by one, and only the "Gaodeng" met the requirements. The other ships all exceeded the limit. Therefore, the "Hana" and "Ruita", which had sailed from Shanghai to Ningbo a few days ago, were unable to enter. However, according to the shipping companies, although the drafts of the ships vary, the difference is very small. In order to ensure the smooth flow of cargo between Shanghai and Ningbo, they are now in contact with the Ningbo Shipping Administration Office to try it out, but it is difficult to predict whether they will be allowed. It is reported that the shipping department of Lulin Foreign Firm saw the above situation and specially rented the "Haikang" of the German Hanwen Foreign Firm. The tonnage of the ship is similar to that of the "Gaodeng", and it sailed to Ningbo yesterday. The German-owned "Gaodeng" and "Haikang" are scheduled to return to Shanghai today.

### The Japanese Side Obstructs Postal Traffic; Zapfel Will Do His Best to Negotiate; The Japanese Side's Intentions Are Still Unclear.

Shanghai Postal Administration Director Zapfel believes that the Japanese side has arbitrarily blocked the main road of North Suzhou Road, making the bureau building encircled by the Hongkou warning area, making it very inconvenient for the bureau to handle postal affairs and for the public to deliver mail. He has dispatched Japanese Deputy Postmaster Jing Zhi Jian Yilang to negotiate, but as of yesterday, there have been no results. In addition to reporting to the General Post Office, Zapfel is determined not to avoid difficulties and will do his best to negotiate to avoid hindering business.

### The Haili Wheel Towed an Iron Barge to Shanghai; The Cable Broke and It Sank.

More than 1,000 Loads of Shaoxing Wine; All Declared Lost.

The "Haili" wheel was represented by the Shanghai Ningbo Road Tonghe Lane Neifeng Yugong Customs Brokerage. At 2:00 PM on the 25th of this month, it towed two iron barges from Ningbo to Shanghai. At 4:00 PM, it sailed out of the blockade line. But at about 6:00 PM, outside the Zhenhai Estuary Yushan waters, the cable suddenly broke. One of the iron barges immediately drifted with the waves. Suddenly, at about 6:00 PM in the evening, it hit a reef and the ship immediately sank. The iron barge was loaded with more than 1,000 loads of Shaoxing wine, worth about 10,000 yuan, and it was declared a total loss.

### Public Works Bureau Road Repair Workers Strike; Demand Pay Raises.

The Shanghai Times reported that 2,600 road repair workers, coolies, and temporary workers employed by the Public Works Department of the Public Works Bureau demanded an increase in wages and rice subsidies due to the high cost of living. Yesterday (the 26th), they began to strike. Although they gathered as usual at the Public Works Bureau's Lou Lang Road, Bai Li Nan Road, and Ren De Road storage locations, they

refused to work unless their demands were met. Their demand for a doubling of wages seems unreasonable, but the Public Works Bureau will still consider this demand due to the high cost of living, so as to increase wages slightly. According to an official from the Public Works Department yesterday, they have investigated the demands of the road repair workers and submitted them to the Public Works Bureau for

consideration and approval. The strikers were quite orderly yesterday and it is expected that there will be no disputes. It is noted that most of the road repair workers who demand wage increases are not officially employed by the Public Works Bureau, but are hired only when road repair work is busy. Therefore, they have not received the benefits of the special rice subsidy issued by the Public Works Bureau to other employees. According to the strikers, they appealed to the Special District One Citizens' Association a week ago to demand wage increases, stating that various public utility companies have recently increased the wages of their employees, while the temporary road repair workers and coolies of the Public Works Department earn only 75 cents a day. They appealed to the Public Works Bureau, but received no reply.

### The Public Works Bureau's Budget for This Year; Business Corps, Fire Department, Police Department

The Public Works Bureau, in view of the fact that last year's depreciation of the national currency led to a sharp increase in expenditures, resulting in a huge shortfall in the bureau's funding, issued instructions to all its departments to reduce and save as much as possible when preparing this year's budget. Now, all departments have complied with the instructions, and all draft budgets have been submitted to the committees for review. According to the drafts, many reductions have been made. The budgets of the Business Corps, the Fire Department, and the Police Department (including the prison) have been discussed at a meeting of the Security Committee on the 2nd of this month. All temporary expenditures are divided into the following two categories as usual: (A) Those that have been reviewed by the board of directors or are deemed necessary; (B) Those that should not be spent this year due to financial conditions and other aspects.

Temporary Expenditure Items in the Business Corps Budget After a detailed review of the various important temporary expenditures of the Business Corps, the original draft listed 53,314 yuan, which was reduced by 34,714 yuan by the committee. The following two items were approved for temporary expenditure: (1) Mobilization equipment costs: 1,600 yuan; (2) Emergency measures costs: 17,000 yuan. The latter includes the cost of purchasing new sacks (many of the old sacks have been damaged and new sacks urgently need to be added to supplement them). According to the commander of the Business Corps, the number of sacks planned to be stored is the minimum limit necessary for the Business Corps to be responsible for defending various posts in the future.

The total amount of recurring expenses listed in the recurring expenditure draft was 1,264,376 yuan, an increase of 379,776 yuan compared to last year. After consultation between the director of the Finance Department and the commander of the Business Corps, 71,946 yuan was reduced. The breakdown and comparison are as follows:

Business Corps Headquarters

Russian Team

Purchase of Stored Goods

Personnel The terms of office of the Business Corps Commander, the Brigade Major, and three sergeants were originally due to expire in 1940. After consultation, the Brigade Major and two sergeants have been dismissed and returned to their countries. Only one of them has been transferred to the Bureau, and one staff member has been added. Therefore, the items "Salaries and Allowances", "Pensions and Retirement Benefits", and "Travel Expenses" in the recurring expenditure section can be reduced by 105,460 yuan.

Business Corps Headquarters The revised figure for the Corps Headquarters budget is 90 yuan less than last year. The main items are listed and compared as follows:

1. Salaries and Allowances (Increase) 37,100 yuan

2. Travel Expenses (Decrease) 28,520 yuan

3. Vehicle and Horse Expenses (Increase) 20,320 yuan

4. Fuel (Increase) 12,900 yuan

5. Repair of Firearms and Equipment (Decrease) 4,260 yuan

6. Ammunition (Increase) 46,720 yuan

7. Sports Camp (Increase) 4,450 yuan

8. Other Items (Increase) 4,640 yuan

((Increase) Compared to last year; (Decrease) Compared to last year)

The increase in "Salaries and Allowances" is due to the increase in salaries, but the important reason is the issuance of living expenses for staff. The increase in "Vehicle and Horse Expenses" is due to the increase in the price of gasoline, etc., and the increased use of transport vehicles during the training of members. The increase in "Fuel" and "Sports Camp" is due to the increase in the prices of goods, food, and sports equipment.

The decrease in "Travel Expenses" is because there are no such expenses listed in the budget. The decrease in "Repair of Firearms and Equipment" is because parts ordered from the United Kingdom cannot be shipped to Shanghai due to the war. The decrease in "Ammunition" is due to the modification of the training syllabus. Under the "Armored Vehicle Team" item, there is an extraordinary expenditure of 8,000 yuan to repair and paint ten armored vehicles. However, after consultation between the director of the Finance Department and the commander of the Business Corps, the amount was reduced to 2,000 yuan, and the remaining 6,000 yuan was transferred from the emergency measures fund to purchase military blankets.

Russian Team The revised budget for the team increased by 294,760 yuan compared to last year, including an increase of 131,060 yuan in salaries and allowances, 18,100 yuan in fuel, 6,410 yuan in water and electricity, 114,840 yuan in food allowances and meals, 19,900 yuan in clothing, and 4,450 yuan in other expenses. The reasons for the increase are mostly similar to those of the headquarters.

Purchase of Stored Goods The chairman of the Security Committee believed that the expenditure on clothing was too large and consulted the commander of the Business Corps on whether clothing could be reduced and whether accessories such as copper buttons could be removed to simplify and standardize the clothing. According to the commander of the Business Corps, this matter is not feasible due to the nationality and team affiliation of the members, so as not to affect recruitment matters. Finally, a group of workers hired at the target range is needed both during target practice and at other times, and it is not easy to reduce them much.

The above budgets have been approved by the Security Committee and may be submitted to the Finance Committee for review, unless adjustments are still made by the director of the Finance Department in consultation with the commander of the Business Corps when necessary.

Fire Department Budget

The draft budget for the Public Works Bureau Fire Department for this year has been submitted to the Security Committee for discussion at a meeting on the 2nd of this month.

The amended items of the above general category of expenditures, except for the "Travel Expenses" item, which is 52,940 yuan less than last year, are all more than last year. The reasons for the increase are generally the same as those of the Business Corps. The expenses for the ambulance team's first aid group are 22,010 yuan more than last year, and the hospital group is 2,820 yuan more. The reason for the increase is that the cost of maintaining and using the ambulance is higher.

The expenses for the purchase of stored goods that are expected to be approved after the amendment are as follows:

A. Temporary Expenditure Items The draft temporary expenses of the Fire Department totaled 187,013 yuan, which was reduced by 95,123 yuan by the committee after detailed review. The important uses include (1) 1,400 yuan for adding Chen Shai leather belt racks to the Yichang Road Fire Station, (2) 1,400 yuan for building a steam boiler room chimney at the Xinzha Road Fire Station, (3) 1,400 yuan for expanding the hot water equipment in the foreign staff dormitory at the Yangshupu Fire Station, and 1,000 yuan for adding a leather belt rack, (4) 7,800 yuan for another star project, in addition, it is planned to purchase a "Gaoli" military body at a cost of 53,210 yuan, and a universal truck body at 14,10 yuan, and a light body at 11,270 yuan.

B. Recurring Expenditure Items The original draft of recurring expenditure items totaled 1,550,867 yuan, an increase of 386,137 yuan compared to last year. After consultation between the director of the Finance Department and the director of the Fire Department, the total amount was reduced by 37,137 yuan. The breakdown and comparison are as follows: (1) 4,500 yuan for the purchase of rescue equipment, (2) 100 yuan for the purchase of faucet indicator tables, (3) 6,600 yuan for the purchase of utensils, (4) 1,770 yuan for factory equipment, (5) 3,500 yuan for the purchase of woodenware and other parts, (6) 17,440 yuan for the purchase of one ambulance, totaling 33,910 yuan.

The above budgets have been approved by the Security Committee and may be submitted to the Finance Committee for review, unless adjustments are still made by the director of the Finance Department in consultation with the director of the Fire Department when necessary.

### A Watchman Was Shot Suddenly

The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reported that a watchman at the Huierdeng Ballroom on Yuyuan Road was guarding the entrance of the ballroom at around 1:15 AM today (the 27th) when he saw two Chinese who looked suspicious lurking nearby. He went up to question them, and the two men, seeing the watchman approaching, suddenly drew their pistols and fired four or five shots before fleeing. The watchman drew his gun and attempted to return fire, but the two men had already disappeared. The watchman was hit by a bullet that pierced his foot. He was taken to the Second Branch of the Tongren Hospital by a fire truck for treatment.

### The Retrial of the Murder of Father An Concluded.

The case of the murder of Father An, the head of the orphanage at Tushanwan, Xujiahui, Shanghai, has been concluded. The culprits, Ju Bolu, Jiang Yunqing, Xu Gendi, Shen Xingtang, Wang Guirong, etc., were transferred from the French police to the Second Special Court, and a public prosecution was filed on charges of robbery and murder. The court, due to jurisdictional issues, requested the Shanghai Special District Branch of the Supreme Court to designate the Second Special Court to hear the trial. The head of the Criminal Court, Liao, held several hearings and designated lawyers Wang Hengyuan and Yu Zhaolin to defend the defendants. The trial has been declared concluded, and the verdict was originally scheduled to be announced on the 7th of this month. Later, because the presiding judge of the case, Liao, believed that the motive of the defendants for killing Father An, whether it was due to conspiracy or robbery, was not clear, he specially announced the revocation of the conclusion of the debate and waited for a scheduled military debate. All the details have been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon at 2:30, Judge Liao, together with Prosecutor Wang, came to Criminal Court One to continue the trial. The lawyers for the defendants, Wang and Yu, also arrived on time. The court ordered the defendants to be brought to court and repeatedly interrogated them about the conspiracy to murder the victim and steal property. After an hour, the court announced that the case had been clarified and ordered the commencement of the proceedings. First, the prosecutor made his statement, and then the police lawyer and the defendants' lawyers debated each other. After the debate, the court declared the conclusion of the debate and waited for the verdict. The defendants were still returned to the detention center.

### Mail from Shanghai to the UK is Inspected by Germany En Route; Magazines Sent from Shanghai Have Never Been Received in London; The Postmaster Also Does Not Know Why the Letters Passed Through Germany.

The North-China Daily News reported that Mr. Rosenpeng, general manager of Meilingdeng Company in this city, told reporters yesterday (the 26th) that the letters he mailed from this port to the UK were inspected by German inspectors en route, and were stamped with a German inspection seal when they arrived at their destination. He also received a notice stating that the magazines sent from

Shanghai last January and December have never been received in London, and it is believed that they have been seized by the Germans.

### Grain: Imported Rice Dips and Rises Again: Speculators Exploit Black Market Exchange Rates and Cause Major Trouble Again

Once the rumors in the rice market were broken, rice prices suddenly [gap]. Yesterday, the early market saw a continued downward trend. No. 1 Saigon rice was sold off as low as 44 yuan to 43.5 yuan, fire-milled rice at 42 yuan, and small-milled rice at 40 yuan and 2 jiao, more than [gap] yuan lower than the previous closing price, seeming to indicate a continued decline. Unexpectedly, news suddenly spread of a sharp rise in gold prices and a shrinking in exchange rates. Speculators immediately seized the opportunity to buy in at low prices, and the market rebounded by more than one yuan. No. 1 Saigon closed at 45 yuan and 2 jiao, 45 yuan, large-milled rice at 43.5 yuan, small-milled rice at 41.5 yuan, Tokyo polished rice at 41 yuan, and mixed broken rice at 34 yuan. However, compared to the previous session, it should be depreciated by [gap] yuan. As for white yuan [gap], they were rarely seen, with no ups or downs. Only second-grade goods [gap] sluggishly and also dropped by [gap] yuan. Kai Shenyang Zhente was 41.5 yuan, 41 yuan, and Danyang second-grade rice was 39 yuan, 38 yuan. There were rumors in the rice market that there were no transactions of Kunshan glutinous rice outside the market at 46-47 yuan, and early and late rice at 43-44 yuan. Whether these rumors are true is difficult to determine because of the extraordinary secrecy of these people.

Foreign rice, bearing the weary wind of continuous sharp declines, has weakened morale. Moreover, the quantity of goods ordered and yet to arrive is very large, and the huge total of already-arrived stock makes it impossible for general speculative decisions to be supported, and many floating loose holdings are panicking to escape. Therefore, the morning market once again suffered a terrible fall of two or three yuan. No. 1 Saigon was as low as 43 yuan, and Tokyo indica rice was as low as 40 yuan. All other types of rice uniformly fell. However, after the sharp decline, local actual [gap] and new hoarders took advantage of the small inquiry, so the market suddenly saw a rebound of about one yuan. However, in the afternoon, floating households took advantage of the high prices to escape again, and the result was still weak. Only futures returned to the sudden rise relatively slightly, while the spot market still pulled a small yuan outside. Second-grade return opened at 52 yuan to 51.9 jiao, second-grade Siam opened at 50.9 jiao to 52 yuan, and small pattern rice opened at 50.8 jiao to 51.34 yuan.

### Flour and Wheat Both Sluggish, Trading Flat

Flour: Yesterday, the flour market returned to a flat and sluggish state. The price of No. 1 flour factory remained unchanged, only supplying this street at a flat [gap], unwilling to sell more. Therefore, other sales [gap] were all restricted, and mainland customers could only rely on spot goods in the market for scattered actual sales. It was heard that the supply and demand for stack order flour was low yesterday, slightly looser than the previous day by five or six fen. The old car brand stack order was quoted at 14.7 jiao, and the green cannon car customer offer was still shouting 16 yuan, but there was no substantial transaction.

Wheat: Yesterday's wheat market trading was also quiet. Both Chinese and Japanese factories had no formal intake, only one or two cars were sold in the market, at a price of 25.2 jiao, slightly more fatigued and falling than the previous session. With the sound of foreign wheat flour from factories arriving in Shanghai, the future of domestic wheat is inevitably affected.

### Securities: Jardine Matheson Shares Rise, Domestic Debt Still Weak

Securities gray market: Yesterday's market conditions were gradually unsustainable due to the outflow of a large number of spot goods. Class C shares broke into the 8-yuan mark again, and Class A shares retreated to the 7-yuan mark again. At this juncture, there have been many instances of sudden entry and exit. The original circulating chips in the market were not of much consequence. This time, however, each decline was mostly due to the outflow of spot goods from new accounts. The chips in the market became increasingly abundant, and the [gap] was narrow, which is a sign of overcrowding. Moreover, due to the cotton yarn delivery relationship during the day, there were not a few people who abandoned this and went to that, which also led to the sharp rise in the spread. There are indeed clues to be found. Currently, because the old bulls have not moved, there will not be any major changes for the time being. Yesterday morning can be called stable, and the entry and exit of small financial circles are also insignificant. In the afternoon, Lianhe suddenly had a large number of sales, and Dingkang also followed the trend to sell off. Jiufeng slightly recovered, and Hongkang had more demand, but the market price was fatigued and unable to rise. As a result, it returned a small two to four jiao, with a turnover of about 800,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below.

Stock transactions: 20 shares of Continental Bank were traded at 70% of face value.

Yesterday, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce stock market was still firmly in a potential position. Jardine Matheson Textile shares were exceptionally active, rising to a maximum of 44 yuan, with 18,500 shares traded. Later, due to many profit-taking activities, the value rebounded and fell back, closing at 42.75 yuan with buyers. China Land Reclamation shares also rose to 14.2 jiao at one point. The rest of the market was relatively calm and firm. Rubber stocks were in great demand.

London, 26th (Tuesday): Today, the listed market prices of Chinese foreign debt remained stable, with no changes in the bonds at either end of the range.

London, 26th (Monday): Today, the listed market price of British [gap] East Company shares saw another increase. HSBC shares rose by £1 each, with those registered in England at £89 and those registered in Hong Kong at £91. Chartered Bank shares rose by 2 shillings and 6 pence, to £12.5. The new price of Kaiping Mines bearer shares after deducting dividends was 17 shillings and 6 pence, a decrease of 1 shilling and 6 pence from the previous [price]. (According to outside rumors, this dividend is 3 shillings per share, but it remains to be verified.) The rest remained unchanged.

### Finance: Foreign Exchange Initially Tightens, Finally Returns to Equilibrium

Yesterday's foreign exchange market conditions: HSBC's listed prices remained unchanged. The black market for US dollars continued to be mediocre.

As for the day's situation, the morning opening was flat, remaining at 4 shillings, 140625, and 6 yuan, 8125. Subsequently, due to a sudden commission from Hong Kong speculative merchants for a certain Chinese bank to purchase 3-month forward sterling, and the fact that foreign firms had considerable demand for settlement, [the market] suddenly tightened to 4 shillings, 125, and 6 yuan, 78125. Fortunately, HSBC suddenly provided settlements, releasing tens of thousands of pounds of spot sterling. In addition, certain American banks and Sassoon and others also began to sell, so although Chinese merchants were active in the meantime, the positions still felt abundant. After 11 o'clock, the market finally returned to equilibrium. The afternoon market was quiet. It was rumored that HSBC had come to buy back spot sterling, but there was no change in the market. By the evening close, it was still 4 shillings, 140625, and 6 yuan, 8125, which was similar to the previous day. The potential for futures was no different from spot.

At this time, the spot price of US dollars also reached 6 yuan, 78125. HSBC's listed prices did not move, and the silver equalization tax also remained unchanged. After that, HSBC suddenly provided tens of thousands of pounds of spot British gold to foreign firms and counterparts, all priced at 4 shillings, 125, causing the market to stabilize immediately.

At the same time, actual demand in South China showed signs of improvement, and the tightening of foreign exchange led to good morale, and the buying style was rampant again. The February period has arrived, and most of it has fallen into the next month, so the March period trading is very prosperous, and the market price is moving forward. The highest peak was 890 yuan. The future of the yarn market must rely on customer sales and the exchange market as a fallback.

The current yarn morning opening price was 8612 yuan for 20-count Bianma [trademark], and 875 yuan for the March period, because the exchange market was still tight and sellers in the [gap] were not prosperous.

However, the general mentality is quite high, and there is no news that the factory has purchased it for a long time. Japanese manufacturers are also very quiet, because the goods they ordered earlier have already been continuously en route, and they will all be decided to arrive at the port.

Hardware transactions have been relatively stable for the past one or two days, and the intake of each road has also been launched accordingly. Both the local and foreign parties have a bit of [gap]. The Cowie [tinplate] goods are the only must-read item for the local can manufacturers. However, toy factories, printing factories, biscuit companies, and cigarette companies also cannot lack it, so this goods can be called popular in the market.

### National Anthem

— Zhang Songran

On the morning of the eighteenth of this month, I followed a large crowd into the Great Light Cinema to attend a music service by the American Navy. The previous day's newspaper had advertised a harmonica band performance, which motivated me to go. Indeed, I was not disappointed. After they played several refreshing tunes, they announced, "Everyone, please stand." I thought the service was over when suddenly I heard a melody that hadn't resonated in my ears for a long time. At first, it sounded so unfamiliar that I almost couldn't understand it. However, involuntarily, my throat joined in, singing along with the melodious, passionate, magnificent, and grand sound waves. The blood throughout my body circulated faster, and my mind immediately cleared up, like waking from a drunken dream. At that moment, everyone present, Chinese and Westerners alike, stood in respect. In that instant, I found several valuable answers:

The Chinese are not like a heap of loose sand!

The Chinese observe order!

The Chinese have not forgotten everything!

As long as we don't abandon ourselves, all friendly nations will respect us.

On the third page of this newspaper on the twenty-first of this month, there was a news item reprinted from the North-China Daily News, titled "A Chinese National Anthem Evokes Patriotic Emotions." This is why I recalled this event, and I thank all the members of the harmonica band that day for giving me unparalleled spiritual comfort.

### A Citizen's Plea

— Someone

Since the Municipal Council announced the increase in the Municipal General Rate, the Special Rate, and the Land Tax, both Chinese and foreigners have paid close attention, because this affects every citizen living in the Settlement. The Municipal Council's reason for increasing taxes is a financial drought, which is like a family. If income does not meet expenditure, one must find ways to make up for it. However, this example also has a slight difference, which is that a family's profit or loss will not affect anyone outside the family, while the Municipal Council's tax increase affects all citizens.

For this reason, we must appeal to the Municipal Council: since the outbreak of the war, the Municipal Council has seen the situation in the Settlement most clearly. For example, the Western Jail is full, exposed corpses have increased sharply, and robbery and fraud cases are endless. All of this illustrates that the current prosperity is superficial, or rather, belongs to a part of the population, because indeed many people have taken advantage of this opportunity to make a fortune. However, their fortune-making has further oppressed the general public, which is a reality that everyone sees. Therefore, while the Municipal Council is experiencing a financial drought, it is unaware that the general public is in dire straits!

However, we do not want the Municipal Council to be in debt. Just as we ourselves are trying to survive in difficult circumstances, the solution is naturally to increase revenue and reduce expenditure. Regarding reducing expenditure, as mentioned in yesterday's newspaper, such as "not hiring many foreigners paid in pounds" and "cutting back on the music band's expenses"—these are just examples that we can see and cite. I think that with the Municipal Council's large scope, there must be other areas where some savings can be made. Regarding increasing revenue, increasing taxes is naturally the best solution, but the facts tell us that now is not the time to increase taxes. Therefore, the way to increase revenue is not simply to find ways to increase income, but to fundamentally solve the problem.

The citizens of the city cannot bear the burden of increased taxes any longer. Since this is due to the reasons mentioned above, the fundamental solution is to bring the public's living conditions back on track. To bring living conditions back on track, suppressing commodity prices is the top priority. Therefore, I believe that the Municipal Council may as well first strictly handle the work of suppressing commodity prices before increasing taxes.

Moreover, if the public's living conditions return to normal, the Municipal Council's financial income and expenditure may not be so depleted!

These are just some personal opinions, and I hope that the Municipal Council and all sectors will correct them.

### Talking About Shrunken Textbook Editions

— Jin Fan

I saw Ji Fufang's report in the Chunqiu on the twenty-third, "It is said that major bookstores are preparing to shrink the editions of elementary school textbooks to save paper and prevent book prices from becoming too expensive." Let's put aside for now whether the bookstores have such a concrete proposal, and talk about whether it is possible to shrink textbook editions from the perspective of educational principles and actual situations.

(1) The size of the font in textbooks not only affects reading, but also has a significant impact on children's health. If the font is too small, children will not be able to recognize it correctly, and their eyesight will easily become fatigued, leading to nearsightedness or other eye diseases.

(2) The line spacing and columns in textbooks have a great impact on reading efficiency. Generally, the line spacing of textbooks for lower and middle grades should be standardized at two centimeters and the columns at eighteen centimeters.

(3) Illustrations can increase reading interest and help children understand the text, especially in textbooks for lower grades, which must have many high-capacity illustrations.

The above three points are all essential standards for the form of textbooks, but after shrinking the editions, can these standards be maintained without being compromised? This is certainly a question. Now let's talk about the actual situation.

When a child receives a new book, they are certainly very cherished. However, soon the corners of the book are rolled up, then the cover falls off... even lost. If we shrink the textbooks, wouldn't it be easier to promote this situation?

Comparing children's readers from various countries around the world, China's elementary school textbooks are already pitiful enough: no good paper, lack of beautiful illustrations, and no sturdy binding... Children's education has already been recognized as a major national undertaking. We are already not doing enough to improve it, how can we "dig" into it again!

No matter how you look at it, shrinking the editions of elementary school textbooks is a losing proposition.

### Underhanded Tactics

Episode 21: Managing Finances by Mixing Fibers; Promoting Machinery to Aid Literary Achievement

Ye Songfen's father's idea was also good. He thought: since we are running a silk store and a silk weaving factory, we should pass on the silk weaving business. But I only have this one son. When I get old, I will pass on all the business to him to manage, so that he will not become a complete outsider. However, Ye Songfen replied to his father: he is not interested in textile science, but he likes economics, finance, and banking. He said: In the future, we can entrust the silk factory to Jiang Jingrong for full management. He is capable and honest, and we can trust him. Ye Songfen's father, seeing his son say this, since he was not suitable for textile science, did not force him. Jiang Jingrong was not only trusted by Ye Songfen, but also by his father. They treated him like family. Soon Ye Songfen went abroad to study, and Jiang Jingrong gradually became an important employee in the factory with the trust of Mr. Ye. At that time, their branch factories were also increasing day by day. In addition to the main factory in Hangzhou, there were also two branch factories; in addition to the main factory in Shanghai, there were also six branch factories. After another seven or eight years, Mr. Ye became old and handed over the silk factory to Jiang Jingrong for full management. At that time, Jiang Jingrong was already thirty years old, and Ye Songfen had returned from studying abroad and was working as a vice president in a bank. What was even more wonderful was that Ye Songfen and Jiang Jingrong became relatives through their classmates and marriage. Why? It turned out that Ye Songfen and Jiang Jingrong's eldest sister fell in love and got married. At this time, his two younger sisters, with the help of their brother, entered the university together. The eldest sister, who graduated first, also studied business. After marrying Ye Songfen, the Jiang and Ye families became relatives. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, Hangzhou was occupied, and part of the Ye family's silk factory in Hangzhou was finished. Even many of the silk factories in Shanghai that were outside the Settlement could no longer work. It was not until after the end of the war that Jiang Jingrong worked hard to revive them. At this time, the silk factory had become a joint-stock company and was no longer exclusively owned by the Ye family. Because after the war, most businesses were cooperative, both commercial and industrial. All company laws have also been improved to seek mutual benefit and prohibit monopoly. Jiang Jingrong also tried his best to improve Chinese silk fabrics. He thought: Chinese silk fabrics have already been famous in the world. People from Europe and the United States who come to China must bring some Chinese silk back to give to their relatives and lovers. In the past, there was a silk shop in Shanghai that specialized in Western-style clothing. Every time a European or American ship came to Shanghai, their retail business could do more than a thousand yuan, and there was no publicity campaign at all. (243)

### Some Contributions to Alarm Systems

— Yao Yongxiu

The newspaper on the twenty-second of this month published a news item about the Public Concession Police Department soliciting residents to install alarm systems. Indeed, there are too many thieves in Shanghai. The Municipal Council, in view of this, is striving for social stability, so it is planning to make each household install alarm systems and vigorously promote cooperation between citizens and the authorities to eliminate crime. However, before the Police Department authorities publish the style and usage of the alarm system in the newspaper, I would like to offer some opinions based on my humble opinion:

(1) The alarm system should preferably be installed using the simplest method, because the previous method of jointly installing alarm bells by five households was too troublesome.

(2) The price of the alarm system should preferably be affordable for the general public, so that every household has the ability to purchase it. Otherwise, although the method of alarm bells is good, the installation cost is too expensive. It can be said that in Shanghai, apart from companies and firms, very few households install alarm bells. Therefore, although there is a good anti-theft method, because of the high price, it is equivalent to not having this method.

The above two points, I hope, are exactly what we, the little citizens, are eagerly looking forward to in the Police Department authorities' plan.

### The Goddess of Pear Garden Presents Literary Gift to Prince Wenyan

— Yan

Prince Wenyan, Zhang Wenyan, before the tenth year of the Republic, took on the role of Little Guihong at the Old Gong stage. At that time, a wealthy merchant named Cao established a firm in the Tongshengong Inn on Er Yangjing Bridge. The inn was very close to the Gong stage. Cao was the leader of the Six Chen businesses in northern Jiangsu, with a magnificent physique and extraordinary generosity. Every spring and autumn, when beans and wheat were harvested in the Jiangsu and Henan areas, Cao always transported several trainloads to Shanghai for sale, thereby making a huge profit. Cao was also a generous person, and the ticket prices at the Gong stage were very low at that time (the highest seat price was only five or six mao). Wenyan had long heard of Cao's name. Before going on stage, it was customary for the case clerk, Little Yang Er, to lead her to visit the residences of various merchant guilds to pay her respects. Although Zhang's talent in both appearance and performance was ordinary, she was good at social interactions and was particularly attentive to Cao. Therefore, all the seats in the main hall and flower pavilion during her three-day performance were bought out by Cao to support Wenyan. The funniest thing was that the merchants living in the inn with Cao, regardless of whether they knew him or not, were all invited by Cao to watch the play at the Gong stage. Sometimes there were not many guests, so he ordered the tea boy and cook to occupy the seats. Cao often hosted banquets at the Xinlicha and Tongxinglou restaurants, and the waiters were very familiar with Cao. Therefore, he also distributed dozens of tickets to them, ordering them to go. In total, Zhang performed on that stage for several years, and Cao spent no less than twenty or thirty thousand gold dollars. Zhang's mother, seeing Cao's magnanimity, not only married her sister to him, but also secretly deposited a large sum of money in Cao's place. From then on, the two sides had even closer relations. With such a powerful supporter, Wenyan's performances were always well-attended, and Wenyan's name became famous for a time. Officials and nobles from Tianjin and Beijing had long admired her name and were eager to see her. When the Goddess of Pear Garden, Li Pusa, hastily left Beijing and performed her Gui opera "Forcing the Palace to Seize the Seal," she sought refuge in the Shanghai Settlement. As soon as her luggage was unloaded, she invited Wenyan's adoptive father, a celebrity in Shanghai, to watch the play at the Gong stage. The owner of the garden specially reserved the central box to prepare for the arrival of the Bodhisattva's chariot. On that day, the Bodhisattva personally selected the play "Meilong Town" and rewarded her with five hundred yuan in foreign currency to show his appreciation. After the play, he insisted on inviting a certain celebrity to accompany him to the residence of the prince in Daqingli for a chat. Everyone saw that the Bodhisattva was also infatuated with the prince, and they all sighed in unison. The Bodhisattva's secret assistant, Rao, originally planned to send out a telegram, announcing to the people of the country, hoping that Chinese and foreigners would shed tears of sympathy for him, and then slowly plan to restore his position. Now seeing him indulging in sensual pleasures and not taking national affairs seriously, his followers gradually dispersed. Before long, the Bodhisattva also left Shanghai and went east to the island of Penglai to avoid the world.

### The Purpose of Watching Movies

— Xin Liang

Do you like watching movies? What exactly is your reason for running into a movie theater to watch a movie?

I have asked many people the above two questions in the past, and their answers are all different. Now let me list their purposes for watching movies one by one:

(1) It is to spend some time. Some people say: "I have been really too free these days. I have nothing to do after eating, so I might as well hide in the movie theater."

(2) It is to seek a moment of leisure for the body and mind. Many people are indeed working too hard during the day. Their spirits are naturally very tired after extreme work. If they don't choose some proper entertainment, or go to the movie theater for two hours, then they will definitely get sick tomorrow.

(3) It is to listen to some fluent English. This group of people is mostly students.

(4) It is to truly appreciate the art of film. They don't watch indiscriminately, and they pay great attention to the excellent acting skills of the actors, the director's clear and concise techniques, as well as the photography, sound, and sets.

(5) It is to see the various dynamics of Europeans and Americans. In fact, don't you often see young male and female college students who are happy to learn the appearance of those red stars?

Do you have a purpose for watching movies? Why do you go to the movies with your beloved wife or daughter? Everyone has different preferences, so of course, the movies they like to watch are also different. I think: watching movies should not only be for entertainment. We should absorb various new knowledge from those good movie scripts.

### Women's Apartment

— Qi Hua

Hollywood film companies have recently been employing new people as much as possible. Their intention is not so much to discover new people as it is to reduce recurring expenses and increase production, because new people have low salaries and are easy to transfer. Linda Darnell is one of the people that 20th Century is preparing to promote.

In "Women's Apartment," Linda Darnell's Marcia certainly occupies a very important position, but her performance is not satisfactory. For example, she is not good enough in several important scenes, such as meeting Jeff and Marilyn at the banquet, and Barbara shooting John.

As for the playwright of "Women's Apartment," he attempts to expose the living conditions of women of all classes, but because he focuses on the love relationship between Marcia and Jeff, he only introduces a few characters through the idle talk of two women. This superficial description has failed the subject matter he has adopted. "A Cage of Flowers and Moon" is better than it in terms of character creation, layout, and structure.

However, "Women's Apartment" is a winner in terms of interest. Every woman meets a man and kisses him goodbye in the hallway of the apartment; Marcia applying for a model, the makeup artist and photographer being busy, are all very interesting. Ann Sothern's Irene naturally adds a lot of interest. However, because of the strong interest, the whole play seems very scattered. In the end, Barbara shooting John is not only abrupt (although she and Marcia had a dispute in the apartment), but also very loose.

### Unofficial History of the Pear Garden

A Certain Kun Actress's Beloved Daughter Fell to Her Death (Part Two)

Unexpectedly, at this moment, the door was pushed open and seven or eight men and women walked in. Among them were two or three wives surrounding a certain Kun actress. As they walked, they were mumbling words of persuasion. When they looked at the Kun actress again, they saw that her face was full of tears, her eyes were swollen from crying, and her hair was disheveled. The engineers were all confused. When they asked her the reason for her absence, she sobbed and said: "Today, because the weather is particularly hot, I didn't feel well. The four children were also making a lot of noise and couldn't sleep peacefully. If I don't get enough sleep, my voice will go wrong. I thought it would be better to take a bath before coming to the recording room. Several children went to the fourth floor to enjoy the cool breeze. The youngest child, who I love the most, was being held by the nanny, also playing near the railing on the fourth floor. Unexpectedly, the nanny dozed off, and the four-year-old child walked to the railing by himself. In a moment of carelessness, he fell from the fourth floor." She could no longer cry when she said this. After being translated to the Westerners, they realized the reason for her lateness, and everyone felt sad for her. However, according to a certain wife who came with her, when the girl fell into the patio, she was immediately smashed into a meat patty. While she was in the bathroom and had no time to dress, the family only told her that she was injured and sent to the hospital. She came downstairs to see the girl clearly, so everyone persuaded and accompanied her to this side. She still doesn't know that her most beloved young daughter has already been crushed to pieces. Everyone felt even more tragic when they heard this. Because there was still a glimmer of hope in her heart, she reluctantly finished recording the few pieces she had asked for, hastily signed her name, took the check for several thousand yuan in her hand, and got into the car. Fortunately, the engineer was an American and very humanitarian, so he was not very demanding. Therefore, although her voice was hoarse and slightly flawed after crying, he couldn't bear to argue with her. Thinking back to when she was at her peak, how could a few thousand dollars catch her attention? Now, because her husband's family is in decline and owes a lot of money, she is doing it again. At this moment of great sorrow, when mother and daughter are separated by death, she still has to force herself to sing. After she returned to her residence, she couldn't even see the bones of her beloved daughter. Her grief can be imagined. Before long, she also died and passed away. I am afraid that the tragic death of her beloved daughter was the biggest reason for her death. (187)

### "Light of East Asia" Begins Filming in Chongqing

Previously, the Chongqing China Film Studio used Japanese anti-war comrades to perform the drama "Light of East Asia" in Chongqing, criticizing the country's warlords for forcing people to fight and portraying the war-weary and homesick sentiments of the invading Japanese army. It was well received by all parties. The original drama has been adapted into a film for international publicity and began filming on February 1. Japanese anti-war comrades will appear in person and participate in the joint performance. Many Japanese anti-war comrades, including Yamamoto Kaoru, Ue Susumu, Takahashi Nobuo, and Nakajo Kakyui, will play important roles in the film.
