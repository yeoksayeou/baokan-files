The technical advisor of the cooperative is a New Zealander named Alley. (Reuters, 14th)

### Opposition to Japanese Expansion in the Far East: South America Supports U.S. Policy; Brazil and Chile Lease Naval and Air Bases; Roosevelt Urges National Sacrifice

Washington: President Roosevelt, at the opening of the annual "Mobilization for Human Needs" campaign here last night, urged Americans to generously support private charitable causes. The President stated, "This year is no less important than previous years. We need to expand our strength. Events abroad have warned us that we need not only a large number of airplanes, tanks, ships, and cannons, but they have also warned us that we should be prepared to make greater sacrifices, bravery, etc., to promote the nation's morale." (United Press, 14th)

Washington: A prominent South American diplomatic expert stated to the United States today that, as a result of discussions with other South American diplomats, he is convinced that South American countries will firmly support the United States' policy of opposing Japanese expansion in the Far East. It is said that, should a conflict arise between the United States and Japan, South American countries will assist the United States with resources. As to whether Pan-America will jointly issue a policy to deal with the Far East after the U.S. declared its protection of Western Hemisphere countries, he did not give a definite answer. (United Press, 14th)

New York: The New York Times reports that Brazil and Chile have agreed to lease naval and air bases to the United States, and the U.S. will bear all expenses for constructing these bases. It is believed that Uruguay may revise its previous decision and agree to lease its bases as well. (Reuters, 14th)

Eugene, Oregon: Japanese Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka, in an article for his alma mater, the University of Oregon's school newspaper, stated today that Japan's position is being wrongly condemned by international public opinion. He wrote, "Among my countrymen, there are many ideas that cannot understand other so-called armed conflicts except for the word 'conquest'." However, he stated that this way of thinking is not popular. Matsuoka added that the East needs the opportunity to build its own house and live its life under a new order created by its own ideas. "Japan assumes a leading position because other countries are incapable." (United Press, 14th)

Chongqing: Naval experts here express doubts about the possibility of any major naval battles between the U.S. and Japanese fleets in the event of a deterioration in U.S.-Japan relations. They anticipate that small-scale battles may be unavoidable, but both sides will be unwilling to risk decisive battles far from their bases. A British and American blockade of Japan, unless close to the Japanese mainland, will likely be ineffective, as their strength in the Pacific is insufficient for a long-distance blockade. These experts believe that once the U.S. fleet moves to Singapore, the Japanese fleet will attempt to intercept it in the ocean. (Reuters, 14th)

### Accelerated Evacuation of Nationals: U.S. Unintimidated

Washington: Government officials continued to hold meetings over the weekend to discuss all matters related to accelerating the evacuation of American nationals from the Far East. The official statement emphasized that the "Manhattan" and "Washington" liners have been ordered by the authorities to sail to the East as soon as possible to assist in the evacuation. However, as of this morning, the date of departure and the routes of these two liners have not yet been announced. (United Press, 14th)

Tokyo: According to semi-official Japanese sources, the Harbin branch of Citibank has closed its deposit department, largely in response to the U.S. State Department's order to evacuate American nationals from the Far East. (Reuters, 14th)

New York: The New York Times, discussing U.S.-Japan relations, stated that the U.S. today is as unintimidated as it was sixteen years ago. Sixteen years ago, the Japanese Ambassador to the U.S., Kijūrō Shidehara, told Secretary of State Hughes that if the U.S. established legislation to abolish the Gentlemen's Agreement and prevent Japanese immigrants from entering the U.S., it would have serious consequences on U.S.-Japan relations. Today, Japanese newspapers, under strict censorship, not only echo Ambassador Shidehara's remarks about retaliating against the U.S., but also threaten a Pacific war to end U.S. aid to China and Britain. If the Japanese are not forgetful, then the experience gained by Shidehara in those years should serve as a lesson. The U.S. can be deceived by clever tactics, but it cannot be intimidated. Today is the same as it was sixteen years ago. (United Press, 14th)

### Hopes for German-Italian-U.S. Understanding Shattered

Berlin: German officials have generally refused to comment on President Roosevelt's speech in Dayton. (Haitong News Agency, 14th)

Rome: Fascist political circles expressed the opinion yesterday that President Roosevelt's speech in Dayton has paved the way for the U.S. to join the war on the British side soon. These political circles said that this speech shattered all hopes for an understanding between the U.S. and the Axis powers. Some authoritative spokesmen here believe that President Roosevelt's remarks are "a declaration of an initial state of war." The spokesman said that relations between the U.S. and the Axis powers have reached a new low. (Nazi spokesmen in Berlin refused to give any special criticism of the U.S. president's speech yesterday, saying they had not yet read the full text of the speech. However, one spokesman said, "The full text of the speech will be thoroughly studied as the basis for any subsequent actions." In his Dayton speech, President Roosevelt declared the principle of the Western Hemisphere being "all for one, one for all," criticized the new alliance between the Axis powers and Japan, and declared that the U.S. is determined to continue providing military assistance to Britain because Britain's courageous war is resisting aggression outside our coast.) Informed Fascist party members solemnly stated yesterday that the Axis powers' greatly increased animosity is the result of President Roosevelt's "contemptuous remarks" towards dictators. The tough attitude adopted by the U.S. President towards totalitarian states in his speech is seen here as a sign of rising U.S. war sentiment. A prominent Fascist party member told reporters today, "Italy should fulfill its responsibilities and prepare to deal with this situation." (United Press, 14th)

### Japanese Side Indicates: Fewer Statements the Better

Tokyo: Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman Suma refused to comment today on President Roosevelt's speech in Dayton, on the grounds that Tokyo has not yet received the official full text of the speech. Suma said, "At this point, fewer statements are better." (United Press, 14th)

Tokyo: President Roosevelt's speech in Dayton on Saturday has attracted widespread attention because it was the first formal expression of opinion by the U.S. regarding the Tripartite Pact, and announced the U.S. government's intention to increase aid to Britain and China. According to semi-official Japanese sources, political observers believe that this speech is intended to sensationalize the public before the election. (Reuters, 14th)

Tokyo: The Yomiuri Shimbun, which often reflects the will of the Japanese high command, stated today that the U.S. has shown a "hostile attitude" toward the Axis powers and the new tripartite alliance. The Yomiuri Shimbun believes that President Roosevelt's speech in Dayton yesterday was the official response of the U.S. to the German, Italian, and Japanese pact. The newspaper said that the President's move clearly misunderstands what the nations that signed the pact expect from the U.S., because the signing of the Tripartite Pact was not intended to deal with any particular country. The newspaper also criticized the U.S.'s mistaken view, stating that the purpose of the pact is to prevent the spread of war, not to cause new wars. The Yomiuri Shimbun criticized the President for making unfriendly references to the three countries. The newspaper said that President Roosevelt often referred to the three countries as "united enemy countries." The newspaper continued, saying that President Roosevelt's motive in the Dayton speech may be to use it to promote his re-election campaign, but in the opinion of the newspaper, the speech is greatly suspected of inciting war. Tokyo newspapers today competed to publish the full text of the President's speech yesterday, and all put headlines of the same nature at the beginning of the speech. The headline of the White Day News said, "The U.S. Will Completely Abandon its 'Appeasement Policy'." The largest commercial newspaper, "Chugai Shimbun," attacked the "irresponsible remarks towards Japan" of American leaders. The newspaper said, "If they think that tough words can intimidate Japan, then they lack an understanding of the current situation." The Hochi Shimbun claimed, "The reason why American political circles are making almost comical remarks is that they misunderstand the true meaning of the tripartite alliance. The American people may think that the tripartite alliance is aimed at the United States, so they are deeply afraid that the Axis powers will directly attack the United States." The newspaper continued, "However, if the United States insists that the construction of a new order in the world by the three countries is an unfair and unreasonable move, then war between the United States and the Axis powers is inevitable." Someone in the Yomiuri Shimbun selected a commentary that said, "It is incomprehensible why American nationals need to be evacuated from the Far East. Japanese nationals abroad, on the contrary, have no intention of panicking. The author also said that Japan is the only country in the world that has been able to preserve its strength after three years of arduous war. The Japanese government and people have gained valuable lessons from this." (United Press, 14th)

### Japan Determined to Implement Southern Advance Policy: Seeking a Quick End to the War of Aggression Against China

Tokyo: The Nichinichi Shimbun stated today that the Japanese government has already decided to sincerely promote the Southern Advance Policy since the conclusion of a "national alliance to protect the uniformity of diplomatic opinions." Furthermore, with Vietnam granting military facilities and friendly relations with Thailand, Japan's foundation for the Southern Advance has long been established. "At present, what is suspended and pending is only the Dutch East Indies issue." The newspaper also claimed that the Japanese government's policy is to launch the Southern Advance as soon as possible in order to seek an early resolution of the China Incident. As for the increasing economic pressure from Britain and the United States, since it is unavoidable, Japan must rebuild its economic system. (United Press, 14th)

### Japan and Dutch East Indies Continue Negotiations: Oil is the Main Topic of Discussion

Hong Kong: Tokyo reports that regarding the meeting between the Dutch East Indies and the Japanese delegation, the Japanese spokesperson said that the most important issue discussed by both sides was the oil issue. The Japanese government has received several reports from Batavia, but the content has not been released. (14th)

### Thai Minister of Information Denies Assisting Japan: Non-Aggression Pact with Britain Already Ratified by Exchange of Documents

Bangkok: Minister of Information Yasasenotai denied today the reports from Vichy that Thailand and the Axis powers are cooperating to help Japan blockade the Burma Road. It is said that Thailand has already ratified the non-aggression pact with Britain by exchanging documents, and Japan has also signed a friendship treaty. Although the Thai Prime Minister recently expressed that it was too early to criticize Britain's decision to open the Burma Road, he has repeatedly declared Thailand's neutrality. Semi-official sources say that Thai troops are currently guarding along the northern border to prevent Britain from reopening the Burma Road or an invasion of Thai territory. (United Press, 14th)

### France's Attitude Towards Thailand

Vichy: The French Foreign Ministry spokesman elaborated today on France's position on various issues related to Thailand, roughly stating: (1) The French government is eager to ratify the French-Thai Non-Aggression Pact signed on July 12 this year. Since the French ratification document has not yet been sent to Bangkok, France intends to ratify the treaty wirelessly. (2) The French government believes that the French-Thai Mixed Committee may not be able to start work before the non-aggression pact is ratified. (3) The French government recommends appointing members of the Mixed Committee to conduct an on-the-spot investigation into the circumstances of Phanthiamese's death. (4) The French government must refuse any other territorial demands made by Thailand. (Haitong News Agency, 14th)

### Anhui Chinese Troops Recapture Xuancheng: More Than 1,000 Japanese Soldiers Annihilated; Chinese Troops Enter the City to Comfort and Gather Refugees

Tunxi: On the 12th, more than 2,000 Japanese soldiers invaded Xuancheng from the northwest and southwest sides. One force was encircled and attacked by Chinese troops north of the city, suffering almost complete casualties. Another force, under the cover of artillery fire, entered the city and engaged in fierce street fighting with the Chinese troops. The Chinese troops inflicted heavy losses on the Japanese on one side, and dispatched a unit on the other side, detouring to the north of the city, uniting with reinforcements, and completely eliminating the Japanese outside the city. They then joined forces to launch a fierce attack on the Japanese troops in the city, annihilating a large number of Japanese troops. The Japanese did not dare to resist stubbornly, so they broke out of the city. The Chinese troops annihilated more than 1,000 Japanese troops in this battle. They have now entered the city to comfort and gather refugees, and at the same time sent troops to take advantage of the victory to pursue the fleeing Japanese troops. On the afternoon of the 13th, the Japanese reinforcements advanced to Yicheng on Jiulishan (between Wanzhi and Xuancheng), and the Chinese troops pursued them immediately. The Japanese troops were already extremely embarrassed under the encirclement of the Chinese troops on all sides. Now the Chinese troops are stepping up their pursuit. (13th)

Chongqing: According to Chinese sources, 6,000 Japanese soldiers in Anhui Province, starting on the 5th of this month, were divided into two routes and advanced towards the Chinese army positions in southern Anhui, implementing their so-called autumn offensive. After the Chinese army fought bravely and fiercely for two weeks, they finally broke the Japanese army's offensive and completely eliminated the remnants of the Japanese brigade east of Jing County. In addition, the war situation in western Hubei has also been very intense in recent days. (Havas News Agency, 14th)

Editorial

### The Brewing and Unfolding of International Competition

Four days ago, the Soviet Union solemnly guaranteed that its policy of aiding China would never change. We are deeply gratified that our observations and judgments in our recent reviews of the Soviet Union's attitude were fortunately accurate. At the same time, it is even more certain that amidst the various difficult-to-grasp aspects of the Soviet Union's international stance, this clear aspect is first obtained, giving a consensus to the international community. The new Japanese ambassador to the Soviet Union has taken office, and the Japanese side says that he has been given full power to conduct all negotiations. Recently, Japanese Prime Minister Konoe made a statement, saying that Soviet-Japanese negotiations are underway. Yesterday, news from Berlin relayed by Tokyo said that Germany had dispatched a mission to Moscow to promote the re-rapprochement between the Soviet Union and Japan. If the central goal of all kinds of actions related to the Soviet Union and Japan is, as Japan has repeatedly stated, to hope to complete its so-called resolution of the China Incident by striving to adjust Soviet-Japanese relations, then the significance of the above-mentioned various actions has been head-on attacked by the Soviet Union's guarantee not to change its policy of aiding China, giving it a failed answer in advance.

The Soviet Union, established in the international community, must have its fundamental grand plan; as for the application of policies, it is of course unconventional, but it does not deviate from its foundation. Therefore, the success or failure of the competition between the Anglo-American and German-Japanese sides to pursue Moscow is at most within the temporary and partial angle of the Soviet policy; perhaps there will be elasticity as a result; beyond this angle, it is ultimately tangential. The Soviet-German alliance, the Soviet Union never sided with Germany and fought against Britain; the recent global chaos, the Soviet Union never hesitated in its approach to aiding China; this is a clear category. However, how to use elasticity between them must be coordinated and echoed with other international situations; therefore, the Soviet Union, which has never boasted about its aid to China in silence for several years, this time, at the same time as Britain abandoned its Far Eastern compromise policy and reopened the Yunnan-Burma transportation, solemnly declared that it would not change its policy of aiding China, encouraging Britain's determination and expressing the mutual adaptation between them. We do not need to overstate how important the meaning of such mutual adaptation is; however, ten days ago, it seemed that the world was expecting the Soviet Union to take the lead in speaking out for Britain and the United States; and at that time, our observation was that "the Soviet Union's attitude towards it is clear, and Britain and the United States do not need to have any new expectations for this; on the contrary, whether the Soviet Union is willing to take a step further and have better actions in the Far East. It is probably after Britain and the United States have taken decisive action"; to let the Soviet Union "launch" everything, "first look at Britain and the United States." From this kind of observation, compared with this time the Soviet Union's declared guarantee, if we try to speculate, we cannot deny that there is a subtle breath between them! Following this pursuit, although the Soviet Union has grasped a very high proportion of decisive factors in the Far Eastern changes and is the focus of world attention, that is, what everyone expects; however, the dynamic fulcrum that the public should pay attention to is not there, but in the Anglo-American in the South Asian evolution. Britain and the United States, especially the United States, have recently been active and energetic in the Far East, and they have probably seen through the key points.

Of course, Britain's and the United States' current vigorous rise, sharing the heavy responsibility in the Far East, is absolutely not comparable to the negligence and contempt of the Soviet Union in the Munich era; but looking at how harmoniously and thoroughly the United States has recently been in diplomacy and material supply to the Soviet Union, it can not only be used as a counter-evidence that it does not neglect or despise the Soviet Union, but also be regarded as the United States' sincere practice of doing its best for the Soviet Union. Some commentators believe that the Anglo-American intention is so, it is not allowed to quickly allow it to be the certainty of the Anglo-American binding of the Soviet Union; moreover, the Soviet Union has always been called an inscrutable mystery, and its actions may go beyond the Anglo-American surprise, causing the Anglo-American to reap the opposite consequences? No one can make a necessary prophecy for this hypothetical fork in the road. And the prophecy does not bear the responsibility of fulfillment, although the prophecy is also useless. However, recently there is no new reason, which can increase some hope for the Anglo-American side. It is because, in the root nature, essence, and long-term interests of the Soviet Union and Germany, Italy, and Japan, there are deep and irreconcilable gaps, irresolvable contradictions, and beyond that, there are things that contradict its fundamental grand plan, but there are also places where the Soviet Union should be cautious and reluctant to face Germany, Italy, and Japan in its temporary and partial policies. Recently, an unnamed reader, Mr. someone, submitted a letter to this newspaper, stating his another observation on the Three-Power Alliance; he said that the Three-Power Alliance clearly faces the United States, and clearly excludes the Soviet Union, but do not forget Mr. Hitler's principle of using unexpected, attacking east and west strategies; he has repeatedly used psychological warfare tactics to divert the opponent's attention, but then suddenly used blitzkrieg tactics to achieve success; therefore, where in the alliance is it clearly excluding the Soviet Union, one should examine its consistent strategy principles and seek its true meaning. He also said: Germany does not want the British Isles, so why must it risk irreversible dangers and pay countless costs to continue attacking the Isles? After he overcame France, the western front was quite stable, so why must he use the alliance to clearly reject the United States from thousands of miles away? The permanent military strategy, which is the resource for establishing a country, is extremely important in the Balkans and Ukraine, and therefore is incompatible with Britain, France, and the Soviet Union from the beginning; now that France has been taken into control, and because of possessing France, it has more than enough to hold Britain, removing two of the three, leaving only a Soviet Union; the alliance clearly excludes "the Soviet Union"; as soon as the alliance was announced, it immediately advanced towards the Balkans and sent troops into Romania. Is this to deal with Britain or to deal with the Soviet Union? This gentleman's argument, we most agree with him on this point about Germany's troops entering Romania. We do not think that the German troops entering Romania are not another aspect of the war against Britain, but we think that this simultaneously emphasized the original contradiction between the Soviet Union and Germany; even if Mr. Hitler does not subjectively use this move to threaten the Soviet Union, in fact, it will probably make the Soviet Union more cautious and reluctant to face Germany because of this move; this is a new reason that is more unfavorable to the British defeat, and it is also to the Anglo-American that it is seeking to win the Soviet Union's sympathy, and it has increased a few new reasons. Yesterday, it was reported that Germany sent a mission to Moscow. Its mission is probably not much for Japan's sake, but its main mission is to explain the entry of troops into Rome, seek understanding, or even promise! International promises often have miraculous effects; but when the benefits are exhausted, the friendship becomes alienated, and the map is poor, then one often sees that is often the case in the chaotic competition.

### Fourteen Aircraft Destroyed in Liangshan, Kunming: Heavy Material Losses, Few Casualties; Fourteen Japanese Aircraft Destroyed in Yichang

Chongqing: Three batches of Japanese planes, totaling thirty-nine, raided Liangshan in northeastern Chongqing, Sichuan, this afternoon, bombing it. The first batch of six Japanese planes was discovered here at noon, and a special alarm was issued when they crossed the Sichuan border. The Japanese planes went up the river together and flew towards Chongqing, but when they reached Chongqing, they suddenly turned around and did not appear over the city, probably because of the low cloud cover. After bombing Liangshan, the Japanese planes flew back to their base. According to Chinese military news from the front line in Yichang, yesterday the Chinese mobile artillery suddenly shelled the Yichang Japanese airfield unexpectedly, destroying fourteen of the twenty-nine Japanese planes parked on the ground. (Reuters, 14th)

(United Press, 14th)

Kunming: Yesterday afternoon, Kunming suffered the most violent bombing ever. The city of Kunming was almost razed to the ground by Japanese bombers. After the bombing, thick smoke still shrouded the sky, as if the entire city had been destroyed. Although the material damage was great, the loss of life was not much, because most of the residents had taken refuge in air-raid shelters. Yunnan University was also hit. A bomb fell a hundred yards outside the American consulate, slightly damaging the consulate building. The glass windows of the German and British consulates were also shattered. A total of twenty-seven Japanese planes participated in the raid, first attacking a certain target in the south of the city. Where the bombs exploded, tiles and rubble flew up, obscuring the sky like smoke. The Japanese planes ravaged the area in a systematic manner, from north to south. When bombing, Japanese fighter planes flew over the sky, and at one point flew low around the city, and the markings on the wings could be seen with the naked eye. (Reuters, 14th)

### Dai Jitao Prepares to Go Abroad; Farewell Tea Party Held in Chongqing

Chongqing: Dai Jitao, President of the Examination Yuan, will be visiting India, Burma, and various parts of Southeast Asia in the coming days.

The relationship between India, Burma, and China in history is very close, and there are many historical records of the mutual exchange of Chinese and Indian culture.

### Navigation Administration Bureau Plans to Build Shallow-Draft Steamships

Chongqing: Wang Kuangyue, Director of the Navigation Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Communications and concurrently Director of the West River Shipyard, was previously injured in a car accident on his way back from a public trip to Guizhou. He was hospitalized for two weeks and has recently recovered. The reporter made a special visit yesterday and inquired about the Ministry of Communications' recent shipbuilding plans. He gave the following detailed account: The West River Shipyard of the Ministry of Communications originally had three factories in Guizhou, manufacturing wooden boats. To date, more than 570 ships have been completed and added to the navigation lines in Guizhou Province, greatly increasing transportation capacity. Now, because the Jialing River and Yuan River areas are both land-sea combined transportation routes, there is a great need for wooden boats. Although the Navigation Administration Bureau has loaned money to manufacture a large number of wooden boats in various parts of Sichuan Province, it is still insufficient. In order to develop land-sea combined transportation in Sichuan and Hunan and to regulate supply and demand, Minister Zhang ordered this bureau to move the First Factory to a certain location in western Hunan, and the Third Factory to a certain location in northern Sichuan, to rush to manufacture wooden boats. The First Factory will remain in its original location and continue to manufacture. In order to meet the needs of the Xiang and Yuan Rivers for shallow-draft steamships, it has been ordered to establish a Fourth Factory in a certain location in southern Hunan to manufacture shallow-draft steamships. After I went to Guizhou to supervise and promote this task, it has been completed. All factories will be able to start construction at the beginning of next month. There will be new developments in the shipbuilding industry in Sichuan and Hunan. The equipment for the shoals on the Yuan and Jialing Rivers, which the Navigation Administration Bureau has been ordered to increase, is also being actively handled, in order to further improve the speed and safety of water transportation.

### German Troops in Romania Show Signs of Advancing South; Soviet Forces in Black Sea Increase Alert; Naval Conflict Between Soviets and Romanians Resolved; Greece, Turkey, and Yugoslavia Prepare to Defend Against Aggression

London: A Reuters diplomatic correspondent says that the entry of German troops into Romania may lead to a breakdown in Anglo-Romanian diplomatic relations. The future plans of the Axis powers are still a matter of speculation at this time. However, the general opinion is that Bulgaria and Greece will be the next targets of the Axis powers. The Axis powers will try to force Bulgaria and Greece to follow in the footsteps of Romania. If successful, Axis troops will reach the Bulgarian-Turkish border to threaten Turkey. The ultimate goal of the Axis powers is to subdue Turkey and Egypt by force or threat, so that they can advance to the Suez Canal. If this is indeed the plan of the Axis powers, it is clearly a gamble. Although Turkey and Egypt have not declared war, Turkey has already issued a statement that if there is an invasion, Turkey will respond with two million rifles. British troops are also stationed in Egypt and Palestine, and they will not allow enemy troops to enter. Turkey does not seem to be overly concerned about Germany's occupation of Romania, because it is now too late for German troops to invade Turkey. Even if Axis troops reach the Turkish border, it should not be considered an action that could disrupt the British Empire's very valuable assets. If Greece is invaded, Turkey will not sit idly by, and Britain will occupy Crete and the Ionian Islands in the Mediterranean Sea. This is something the Axis powers cannot ignore.

Bucharest: According to a traveler who arrived here from the Black Sea port of Constanta, political circles there believe that German troops are currently preparing to attack Greece through Romania, and the Soviet Union is preparing to deal with the incident. (Reuters dispatch of the 14th)

Madrid: People here are paying close attention to the developments in Romania and the Middle East. Westerners often express the opinion that if the Axis powers do not quickly attack Egypt and achieve results, then the occupation of Romania will not be in Germany's interest, because the Allied forces will bomb the Romanian oil wells. Italian General Bono went to Seville yesterday, plans to go to Granada today, and will return home on Wednesday or Thursday. (Reuters dispatch of the 14th)

German Military Mission Arrives, Romanian Military and Civilians Indignant

Bucharest: The sudden arrival of the German "military mission" has shocked the Romanian people. Morale is very high in the Romanian army. When the keys to the 6th Regiment's camp were formally handed over to the German army, a young military officer shed tears. The arrogant behavior of German officers in Bucharest cafes has aroused public anger. In one case, four German officers, after a hearty meal at a hotel in Bucharest, ran over and killed a Romanian on the street in their car. Onlookers saw this but were afraid to speak out in anger.

Five British Nationals Detained in Romania for Espionage

Five British nationals were recently arrested here on charges of "pouring acidic liquid into oil bound for Germany". This move has further complicated the already strained relations between Britain and Romania. Well-informed sources predict that Anglo-Romanian relations may become more strained at any time. It is reported that the Romanian government has introduced chemical inspections of every oil tanker bound for Germany to prevent British espionage. In the future, German secret police will cooperate with Romanian secret police. Police were busy yesterday confiscating leaflets opposing German activities in Romania from the public. A large number of leaflets were thrown into government agencies, public places, and newspaper offices throughout the city. However, apart from the leaflets, there was no organized anti-German rule action in the city. Yesterday, news was received locally that a team of Italian planes and pilots had arrived in Constanta on Saturday. As of late Sunday night, it had not been verified. Yesterday, the British Consulate was crowded with British nationals completing the procedures for leaving the country. It is understood that a transport ship dedicated to carrying British nationals will leave Constanta on Monday. British nationals can be evacuated in a few days. Bucharest was outwardly calm yesterday, and German officers were constantly going in and out of the streets and hostels in groups of three or five. (Associated Press dispatch of the 10th)

### Britain Stops Paying All Accounts to Romania; German Mission to Moscow to Prevent Anglo-Soviet Rapprochement; Rumor of German Plans to Define Spheres of Influence

Bucharest: According to yesterday's Afhtong newspaper here, Romanian accounts in Britain and the Empire have been stopped. This measure by Britain comes after the United States stopped paying all accounts to Romania. London's motive in publishing about this matter is fear that the accounts will fall into German hands. (Haitong dispatch)

Tokyo: News from Berlin has been received here that the German Foreign Office has dispatched a mission to Moscow, hoping to prevent the trend of Anglo-Soviet relations improving. The German ambassador to the Soviet Union, who went to Berlin, flew back to the Soviet Union last night. Neutral observers in Berlin believe that Germany is currently seeking to agree with the Soviet Union on some method of dividing regions, and following the public guidelines set by the Axis powers for Japan, mutually recognizing the other's sphere of influence. Hitler will respect Stalin's "interests" in Afghanistan, Iran, and other Central Asian regions, in exchange for Soviet acquiescence to Germany's invasion of the Balkan Peninsula. Berlin has not expressed hope that the Soviet Union and Japan will approach each other again. (Reuters dispatch)

Madrid: From the Berlin dispatch of the Spanish Efe News Agency, it is clear that the Germans are now quite suspicious of the Soviet Union's attitude. The correspondent stated the German official view that the strange events that have occurred in the past few days show that German-Soviet relations are "currently" still good. Talks will begin in Moscow in a few days, aimed at auditing the half-year trade surplus between Germany and the Soviet Union, which is a sign that the existing good understanding between the two countries still exists. Therefore, the rumor heard by people in Madrid that after the alliance of Germany, Italy, and Japan, a "surprising diplomatic event" is expected to occur in Moscow may not materialize, and the prospect of improving Soviet-Japanese relations also proves that Stalin does not want to engage in dangerous adventures. (Reuters dispatch)

Lyon: The Times recently published an editorial commenting on the Soviet Union's attitude, with the meaning that the Soviet Union's position is indeed very important in the current international struggle, but to say that the country's policy will have a drastic change, and that if it does not actively cooperate with the two Axis powers of Germany and Italy, it should approach the two countries of Britain and the United States, is too early to say. In fact, the Soviet Union's current policy, which can avoid being drawn into the vortex of the European war while obtaining so many territorial and economic benefits, will not be rashly changed due to recent events. In short, the goal revealed by the Soviet government is to avoid being drawn into the war as long as its own interests are not directly threatened, to try to improve relations with various countries and to resolve various outstanding issues with its neighbors in a peaceful manner, and to do its best to strengthen its military equipment in order to cope with future events. If the current war in Europe spreads to the Far East and expands into a world war, then the country cannot continue to ignore it. Moreover, the Slavic ethnic groups have always been of concern to the country, and it must pay close attention to the various changes that may occur in the Balkan Peninsula and the Near East. As for the Far East, since Japan joined the German-Italian alliance, the nature of the relationship between Japan and the Soviet Union has been completely changed. (Havas dispatch of the 13th)

### British Air Force Bombs Krupp Armaments Factory with Unprecedented Power - Most Fierce Strike Against Germany Since the Start of the War - Dropped Giant Bombs Hit Targets and Started Fires

London - Yesterday at dawn, the British Air Force flew to Essen, Germany, and bombed the Krupp steel factory, the largest in Europe, for two hours, inflicting the most fierce blow since the start of the war. British planes used flares to find their targets and then dropped bombs, which were larger than those previously used, and also dropped high-explosive bombs, which hit their targets. According to one airman, when the British planes flew to Essen, they used flares to see the factory buildings, which stretched for miles. Black smoke billowed from the chimneys, indicating that they were working at full capacity. The bombs dropped by the British planes either hit the machinery directly or were very close to it. Another pilot said that he circled over the factory area for fifteen minutes to find the exact location of the power station, and then dropped bombs, which hit the target and started a fire. British planes that arrived later then bombed the machine shops fiercely, and the fire became very intense. At the same time, Blenheim bombers from the British Island Command flew near Trondheim, Norway, and bombed a German supply ship, which was hit and caught fire. Earlier, Blenheim British bombers patrolled the northern coast of Norway and saw two supply ships marked with the "卍" symbol, each weighing about 2,000 to 3,000 tons, with decks full of cargo. They flew low and bombed and strafed the two ships separately. Two hours later, when the British planes flew back, they still saw one of the two ships on fire, with thick smoke billowing. Soon after, the British planes saw another supply ship near the Norwegian coast, but because they had run out of bombs, they opened fire and strafed the ship, which sped towards the shore to avoid them. (Reuters, 14th)

London - Officials announced that last night, despite extremely unfavorable weather conditions, the British Air Force still launched attacks on several targets inside Germany. The Channel ports were also among those bombed. British planes also bombed the naval bases of Kiel and Wilhelmshaven, and the Krupp factory in Essen. According to the Air Ministry, one British plane was lost in the above raids. (Reuters, 14th)

London - Officials said today that British planes used the largest giant bombs ever used to launch a devastating attack on 40 German military targets on the continent, including the Krupp armaments factory in the central district of Berlin, and other German military centers and transportation hubs.

According to German-controlled radio messages, four thousand Dutchmen have already been dispatched to Hamburg to assist in construction work. (Reuters, 14th)

British Air Force Night Raid on Berlin - Fires in Many Central Areas

London - On Saturday, the British Air Force launched a night raid on Berlin, dropping tons of high-explosive bombs and hundreds of incendiary bombs, and fiercely bombed several military targets in the central district of Berlin. Although the bombing's detailed results could not be clearly seen due to cloud cover, large fires could be seen from far outside the city. According to the Air Ministry's intelligence office, the first batch of attacking British planes arrived in Berlin at nearly 10 p.m. The local artillery, aided by the city's surrounding searchlights, resisted fiercely, but the British were good at using low clouds to fly towards the city center from all directions, found their targets through the gaps in the clouds, and bombed in turn at high and low altitudes. The central power station in the Moabit district was particularly targeted by the British planes, which dropped incendiary bombs and set it on fire. The Berlin dispatch of the Swiss Afton newspaper described the situation in Berlin when the air raid alert was issued on Saturday night, when traffic stopped and entertainment ceased, and people suddenly rushed to take cover, saying that Berlin had been safe for four consecutive nights. On Saturday night, when pedestrians were crowding the streets, the alarm sounded loudly. The underground trains all stopped at the nearest station, and the passengers all got off the train. The train only proceeded after the alarm was lifted. The trams also stopped immediately, and the drivers and conductors, and the passengers hurriedly took refuge in air-raid shelters. The theaters and cinemas stopped showing films, and the audiences went to the cellars for cover. Restaurants also stopped serving meals. (Reuters, 14th)

London - Berlin's main transportation lines were disrupted by the British Air Force's fierce bombing, causing great inconvenience to Berlin residents. Although senior Nazi officials expressed calm and set off for Upper Bavaria for their "autumn vacation," less important Berliners were not encouraged by this. According to recent news from Germany, although Berlin residents recognize air raids as inevitable, they also feel that General Goering's repeated guarantees that foreign planes cannot penetrate German defenses are simply deceptive. A Swedish newspaper recently published a conversation with a Swedish sailor who recently arrived in Sweden from Luleå on a ore carrier. He said, "My impression of Bremen was constant bombing. On the eve of our arrival in Bremen, the port's large warehouse was bombed to the ground. Although the damage to the city was not as great as the bombing of the naval base and its wharves and warehouses in Bremerhaven, it was still a scene of devastation. Every night, the bombing was so intense that it was extremely dangerous. We spent seven days and nights there, and could not sleep peacefully because the air raids lasted for hours." (Reuters, 14th)

German and Dutch Coastal Port Areas Attacked by Air Raids in Storms

London - According to an Air Ministry communiqué, on Friday night, bombers of the Royal Air Force attacked many places in Germany and German-occupied territories in unfavorable weather, with great success. One pilot said, "The weather was impossible. When approaching the Dutch coast, the sky was covered with thick clouds, completely dark, and there was heavy fog and rain. Neither the sea nor the land could be seen. It was also extremely cold in the air, almost freezing, and flying was quite difficult." According to the pilots' reports, although the thick clouds hindered them in many places, the enemy's anti-aircraft guns and searchlights were also hindered. When bombers bombed Wilhelmshaven, the clouds cleared and they saw the target, so they dropped a very large bomb on the port area, and then there was a huge explosion. Other planes continued to drop bombs, and then fires broke out. At the same time, planes attacked Bremen, and explosions occurred repeatedly on the ground in Kiel. When the planes left, three large fires could be seen. The shipyards of Hamburg and the Dutch oil refineries also caught fire due to bomb hits. Several airfields on the six islands of Texel and others on the Dutch and German coasts were also severely damaged. When bombing Texel, a heavy bomber was attacked by two enemy fighters, and one of them was shot down into the sea. A British plane descended to an altitude of 5,000 feet over Den Helder and attacked ships along the docks, causing five large fires. German attacks on British ports such as Antwerp and others were also attacked. The port of Boulogne and Woosdan experienced huge explosions and flames due to bomb hits. (Reuters, 13th)

London - A joint communiqué from the Admiralty and the Air Ministry stated that after Cherbourg was fiercely bombed by British naval heavy warships and the British Air Force on Thursday night, the British immediately sent planes to scout. Although it is impossible to publish all the intelligence obtained, it can be announced that the port's shipping has been greatly reduced, and its shipyards and seaplane base have been damaged. Torpedo boats in the small bay were also damaged. Only a few small boats remained in the Bassin d'Airs, and the dry docks and repair shops in the Bassin Napoléon were also damaged. When the British planes flew to scout, they saw a ship and the entrance to the east side of the inner harbor still burning. The main seaplane base of Zhang Telaian was also hit and severely damaged.

### Fierce Air Battle Over London - German Planes Break Through Anti-Aircraft Fire Net - Drop Bombs in Central London

London - Yesterday, tens of thousands of London residents witnessed several attempts by German planes to attack London being repelled in the streets. Spectators saw four or five bombers dodging through the clouds and eventually escaping. A Spitfire British fighter plane swooped down from the west and fiercely attacked nine German fighter-bombers. When the British plane accelerated, the German planes dispersed and quickly fled to the southeast. An Air Ministry communiqué on Sunday's air raid stated that shortly after noon, enemy planes began a series of air raids on southeastern England. The number of planes was small, but later, German planes in batches flew across the Kent coast in succession. Several of them sneaked into the London area and dropped bombs on several places in London and the suburbs. There was no major material damage, and there were some casualties. Several houses in one area were destroyed by bombing, and a fire broke out, which was quickly extinguished. Two places in the suburbs of London were bombed, causing some casualties. The damage suffered in other places was minimal. According to reports received so far, one enemy plane was shot down, and the British also lost one fighter plane, but the pilot was unharmed. (Reuters, 11th)

London - Last night, German planes made their 37th night raid on London, earlier than usual. Not long after the air raid sirens sounded, bombs fell one after another from the moonlit sky. The German planes invaded the skies over London in teams of four or five, taking turns approximately every fifteen minutes. This method was obviously an attempt to defeat the capital's defenses. The German planes were flying so high that the anti-aircraft shells fired upwards and exploding at the German planes' altitude could hardly be seen from the ground. Two bombs fell in one area of London, destroying five houses, and many people were buried in the broken beams, broken rafters, broken tiles, and ruined walls. After the air raid on London began yesterday, German planes were again reported to have flown over Liverpool and a town in the west. The people of London went to the air-raid shelters at dusk, while the sound of distant anti-aircraft guns seemed to warn them that the raiders were coming. On Sunday morning, there were no air raid alerts in the London area. There were only two alerts all day, and the second one was very short. However, during the second air raid, six high-explosive bombs fell in one area of London, four of which landed in open fields, causing no damage. The fifth bomb destroyed a tavern, and the sixth bomb damaged one side of a school building and destroyed another tavern. The two bombs caused more than a dozen deaths and injuries. After Sunday's short air raid, last night until dawn this morning, the German planes again wreaked havoc. Countless houses were destroyed in several areas of London, and in several other areas, incendiary bombs fell like rain. After midnight, 21 areas of London had been bombed, and the German planes were launching intermittent attacks around the city, reportedly breaking into London and unloading their deadly explosives. A house was hit by a bomb, and it is feared that many people were killed under the house. Rescue teams immediately rushed to search. Incendiary bombs caused fires in several places in one area, but the fires were quickly brought under control. Last night's air raid on London was much lighter than the previous few nights, but it was reported that several other places in Britain were also bombed at the same time. It was reported that in a city in southeastern England, a bomb destroyed the mayor's home's basement, and the mayor and his wife are feared to have been killed. Machine gun fire and aircraft engines were heard over eastern Ingria, and it was reported that an air battle had taken place there. Spitfires chased two German planes out to sea. South Wales was also reported to have been attacked. Bombs also fell in the working-class area of a town in northwestern England and a town in southeastern England. During the first air raid yesterday, thousands of people saw German planes repeatedly attempt to break through the defense line and reach central London, but were repelled by British fighters. British fighters chased four or five German planes in the clouds, closely pursuing them until the German planes fled back to their homeland. After a Spitfire swooped down on nine German fighter-bombers from the west and broke through their formation, the German planes scattered to the southeast. The anti-aircraft batteries along the coast of Kent heavily attacked several squadrons of Messerschmitts flying towards London. The German planes were hit and dispersed their formation into several small teams, still pushing towards London. It was not until a squadron of Spitfires rose to meet them that they turned back and fled. (United Press, 10th)

London - Last night, German planes bombed 36 districts of London and more than 20 other places. An apartment in Liverpool was hit by a bomb, causing many deaths and injuries. A monastery was bombed, but fortunately, no one was injured. German planes dropped a new type of "bread basket" bomb in the suburbs of London, which was filled with small high-explosive bombs instead of incendiary bombs. Residents reported that 16 bombs exploded in succession within one minute. The Air Ministry announced that a total of two enemy planes were destroyed yesterday. The British lost two fighter planes, but their pilots had safely escaped. (Reuters, 10th)

### Italian Planes Continue to Bomb Aden

### Details of the Malta Sea Battle - Italy Lost Four Ships

Rome - The details of the Malta sea battle mentioned in yesterday's military report are still being announced. However, according to reports from Stefani correspondents, on the morning of October 11, an Italian torpedo boat patrol discovered a British fleet in the Strait of Sicily. The Italian flagship, with a displacement of 600 tons, rushed to within 700 meters of a British large cruiser at maximum speed, firing three torpedoes in succession while bombarding the enemy ship with its cannons. The ship was sunk by a torpedo. The Italian torpedo boat was also sunk by enemy fire. Fortunately, all the sailors and crew were rescued by another Italian boat. The battle continued for some time, and two more Italian torpedo boats were sunk. Another torpedo destroyer was hit by enemy fire and could not move. It was towed by another ship and then scuttled by its crew because it was no longer usable. On Saturday morning, the enemy ships retreated to their base. (Haitong News Agency, 14th)

According to Sweeney, competition to join the squadron is fierce. Hundreds of American youths have applied to the Montreal recruitment office to join, so there is no shortage of manpower. On average, twenty people are selected each week to come to England for training. (Reuters, 14th)

### The Reason for Marital Tragedy - The Spearhead withers on the Wedding Night; - A Wife yearns for rain during a long drought, how can she not resent the endless wait!

Affectionate feelings, as sticky as glue and as thick as lacquer, this is the phenomenon that a loving couple should exhibit. Truly, when a robust man with powerful feelings marries a charming girl who is yearning for spring, they will inevitably have affection as deep as the sea, happiness surpassing flying, giving birth to clever children, and organizing a happy family. What happiness this is! Originally, a couple is the combination of male and female love, they should be in harmony with each other, intimately connected, sharing joys and sorrows, with no distinction between you and me. If a couple is not loving, with whom shall they be loving? However, the reality is often not so. Loving couples do exist in this world, but there are also not a few couples who hate each other like enemies. In social news, tragic events such as suicide, murder, elopement, adultery, separation, and divorce are not uncommon.

Why does a lover turn into an enemy? Why does a husband and wife become adversaries? There are various, intricate, and confusing reasons for this. However, the decline of sexual function, leading to the wavering of love, is often the most common cause. To be frank, a couple is the union of sexual relations. If their sex life is fulfilling, then their love will inevitably be strong. If a man has committed self-pleasuring and seminal emission in his early years, or if he has been dissolute and indulged in lust after marriage, or if he has damaged his sexual function due to overwork and anxiety, resulting in seminal leakage, premature ejaculation, impotence, incomplete development of sexual organs, shortness like a finger, neurasthenia, thin sperm, infertility, etc., then there will be no way to have a satisfactory sex life for the couple. Let us put ourselves in her place and think. If the one who is in the inferior position, who is gazing with beautiful eyes and yearning for joy, finds that her partner is completely useless, or even collapses at the first sign of trouble, then everything is over. What a heartbreaking thing this is! If it happens again and again, making her youth wasted, how can she not feel resentment? Therefore, love breaks down, and all kinds of tragedies occur between couples!

The only way for a smart husband to remedy this is to cure the disease from the root. According to world-renowned doctors and my experience, the most effective and appropriate treatment is to take the gonadal hormone preparation "Sheng Zhi Su". This agent is replicated using scientific methods from the gonadal hormones extracted from strong animals such as gorillas and sea dogs. Therefore, it is of pure quality and has a potent medicinal effect. After taking it, it can generate sperm, tonify the kidneys, strengthen the brain, activate blood circulation, and nourish the nerves within one day and night, exerting a great effect. If you continue to take it, you can completely cure the above symptoms in a short period of time, and you can also benefit from longevity, extending your life, and rejuvenating yourself. Only those with seminal emission need to take "Xi Mi Tuo Shi Gu Jing Pian" at the same time to strengthen the seminal gate and prevent leakage, so that both the symptoms and the root cause can be treated, and the effect will be rapid.

### Failure to Treat Seminal Emission Can Lead to Premature Aging and Death

— Venereal Disease Specialist Zhan Nian-zeng

According to health experts: "A person is originally supposed to live to seventy or eighty years, but they shorten their natural lifespan due to carelessness and illness, and this is their sin!" So, how sinful is it for young people to commit self-pollution and seminal emission? Seminal fluid in the human body is the most precious of all endocrine gland secretions. It functions to regulate metabolism, promote developmental functions, and nourish various nerves. If self-pollution and seminal emission cause excessive loss of seminal fluid in the body, the metabolic rate will decrease, new cells will be lacking in various tissues, and too many old cells will die. This leads to a sallow complexion and emaciated body. Although young in age, one already appears old. Furthermore, due to the weakening of the brain, spinal cord, and sexual nerves, various symptoms such as memory loss, insomnia with excessive dreaming, back pain, kidney deficiency, and scattered energy will follow. Not only that, but failure to treat seminal emission will inevitably lead to depletion of essence and exhaustion of blood. Developmental functions will be inhibited, often resulting in a short stature and small genitals, like a child. Indeed, such a youth, on the verge of death, will not only be unable to concentrate on studies and be incompetent in their profession, but will also be impoverished and accomplish nothing in life. Even in the marital life that is essential for life, they will inevitably fail to fulfill their duties, be hated by their wife, and the family will fall into a miserable hell. With a weak body, and encountering all kinds of stimulation, leading to suicidal depression or succumbing to illness, is also very common!

To seek remedy, self-pollution must be stopped, and seminal emission must be treated as soon as possible. Taking "Hemitol's Semen-Consolidating Pills" can consolidate the seminal gate, calm the nerves, and seminal emission will heal itself. If seminal emission has already caused the above-mentioned symptoms, it is necessary to also take the gonadotropic hormone preparation "Reproductin" to nourish the brain and kidneys, increase essence and blood, nourish the nerves, promote developmental functions, and invigorate metabolism. If continued to be taken, it will definitely be able to completely cure the above symptoms in a short period of time, and can also achieve the effect of prolonging life, rejuvenating, and returning to youth. However, if patients in this city can come to our clinic in person for expert treatment, a cure can be guaranteed.

Beauty and Health

### The Latest Method for Developing Breast Size

— American Medical Doctor Yao Chongpei

If we want to thoroughly understand the value of female beauty and health, then undoubtedly we only need to first estimate the level of breast development, which is most essential. If a woman's breasts can be higher and more elastic, then not only can they form the most mysterious curves with a graceful waist and plump buttocks, making people intoxicated and admiring, but also their ovarian function must be healthy. The metabolic rate must be vigorous, so their temperament is invariably gentle and docile, their muscles invariably crystal clear and white, and their complexion is invariably ruddy and charming. Not only are they fragrant and envied everywhere, taking up many advantages, but also in the private life within the boudoir, they invariably satisfy their husbands and have infinite happiness!

But having said that. If this kind of happiness is destroyed due to breast binding, self-pollution, or suffering from menstrual irregularities, leucorrhea, anemia, etc., resulting in the destruction of ovarian function and affecting the metabolic rate, leading to breast atrophy and loss of beauty and health, then the god of happiness will not be close to her, and what she encounters is only a bad environment and a tragic fate. The only remedy is to actively take the ovarian preparation for women "Reproductin," which is most suitable and effective. This preparation was invented by the Austrian physiology master Dr. Staner after more than thirty years of arduous experimentation, and has been proven by many famous Chinese and Western doctors to have mild properties and great efficacy. Regardless of various hidden female diseases, they can all be completely cured in the shortest period of time. If continued to be taken consistently, it can not only make atrophied breasts stand tall, but also make the kidneys plump, the muscles smooth, and the cheeks delicate, keeping youth for a long time.

### Gandhi Drafts Plan to Fight for Freedom; Prepares for Final Fast; Congress Passes Non-Violent Movement

Wardha: Gandhi's civil disobedience plan has been approved today by the All-India National Congress Executive Committee. This plan is a response to the British Empire's failure to meet the Congress's demands for independence. It is understood that only two people will be involved in this plan. It is rumored that Gandhi or Nehru may be arrested for distributing leaflets promoting non-violent civil disobedience. (International News Agency, 14th)

Wardha: The All-India National Congress Party Council issued a statement before adjourning, endorsing Gandhi's proposed individual civil resistance plan. The implementation of this plan will be limited to a small number of people. It is heard that Gandhi proposed that initially only two people would be eligible for arrest, one being the most prominent non-violent passive resister, and the other most likely being Nehru. (Reuters, 14th)

Wardha: The two people Gandhi is preparing to be arrested by the British authorities are Nehru and Vinoba. Vinoba is promoting non-violence in the meeting place every day, and his method of promotion will not be tolerated by the government. It is expected that Vinoba and Nehru will be ordered to speak to the public assembly when necessary, and the German government will arrest them, while Gandhi himself has decided to operate outside of prison, so as to personally guide the passive resistance movement and maintain strict restrictions. (Reuters, 14th)

Delhi: The All-India Hindu Association Council passed a resolution criticizing the attitude of the All-India National Congress Party, saying that the future of India's political liberation depends on the victory of Britain, because the fates of India and Britain are inextricably linked. (Reuters, 14th)

Bugar: Because of the recent two-party meeting between Gandhi and the Viceroy of India, the demands made were extremely moderate, but the Viceroy rejected them. Therefore, at present, the members of the Indian National Party will fight for freedom even at the cost of their lives. (Haitong News Agency, 14th)

Bombay: Gandhi confirmed last night the news that he plans to make a final fast, which is said to be related to the upcoming disobedience movement. This movement is to resist officials who prohibit Gandhi from giving anti-war speeches. Gandhi explained last night that the plan for his fast has not yet been decided. In a letter responding to Baravia, Gandhi only admitted that the news of his fast was "considerably accurate." The letter said, "I have told the Congress Executive Committee and some friends about this idea. I will definitely fast one last time in my life. My fasts are all momentary inspirations. I call them God's gift. The results of the fast are also beautiful. I hope reading this letter should not make you anxious. If God has prepared a fast for me, then the fast will come, and the result will be beautiful. May God's will be done." (United Press, 14th)

Walta: News here last night, Gandhi has selected a worker to lead a movement to resist those who prevent Gandhi from giving anti-war speeches. It is heard that Gandhi originally intended to publish a statement to declare the reasons for his determination to support the authorities and let the conflict happen at this time when Britain is fighting for life and death. It is believed here that the scope of this upcoming movement will be limited, and Gandhi is also prohibited by the Congress from being named to participate. (United Press, 14th)

European War Talk (21)

### Paris Under German Occupation

Paris, known for its prosperity, has lost its former bustling scene since being occupied by the German army. The situation in the city is desolate, and the number of unemployed residents is countless. Men and women on the hunger line, especially housewives and demobilized soldiers still wearing military uniforms, stand in long lines every day outside food stores and butcher shops, waiting to buy food, and the severity of the food shortage can be imagined. The following is a translation of the recent situation in Paris as recorded by the New York Times:

French Deputy Prime Minister Laval secretly went to Paris from Vichy on August 26. At the Médignon Hotel, he hosted a banquet to entertain senior German military officers to discuss the issue of the French government moving back to Paris. Although the German side expressed its willingness to discuss this matter at length, it also said that in fact there was a major difficulty. If the Pétain government moved back to Paris, the number of officials of all levels who would follow would be around 25,000. In this overstaffed Paris, it would be difficult to accommodate such a large number of people no matter what.

French demobilized soldiers and people who have been affected by the war and have lost their jobs have recently returned to Paris one after another to seek work. Among the 3 million French people in the Paris area, no less than 600,000 are unemployed. Originally, 75% of those working in factories in the suburbs of Paris were munitions workers. Because the munitions factories closed, these workers were all unemployed. Laval's return to Paris in disguise, in addition to discussing with the German side about the Pétain government's return to the capital, will also try to solve this serious unemployment problem with the German military authorities.

A New York Times reporter went to Paris from Vichy in late August and found it difficult to go from Vichy to Paris, waiting for a week before obtaining a pass from the Vichy government. The situation in Paris is very different from the past. A notice was posted at the entrance of the Mauriki Hotel on the Rue de Rivoli, with the words "Paris Garrison Headquarters" on it. The German side does not call Paris a metropolis, but degrades it as a city, which is very striking.

On the way from the suburbs to the city, the swastika flag of the 13th-century Château de Vaux-le-Vicomte flew in the wind, indicating that the German headquarters was stationed there. Along the way, I saw German soldiers coming and going, some walking, some riding motorbikes, and some sitting in cars and transport vehicles. In the ditches on both sides of the road, there were more than a thousand various vehicles that had been damaged, all abandoned by the military and civilians when they fled Paris. On the section of road from Fontainebleau to Paris, which was always busy with traffic, the road is now deserted under the dark twilight. Driving along the avenue, heading straight for the Italian Gate. Driving into Paris on a foggy summer night, I saw a desolate scene and a feeling of dragging mud and water. There were no vehicles on the road. After driving for three or four minutes, I reached the Avenue Raspail. Except for a few people seen at the gatehouses of a few large buildings, everything was lifeless. A coffee shop at the intersection of the Boulevard Montparnasse was still open, and customers were sitting on the steps. Those artists and aspiring artists have not forgotten this lovely place.

Passing through the Boulevard Saint-Germain, crossing the Place de la Concorde, and reaching the Champs-Élysées, I crossed the center of Paris again in a few minutes. The twilight was gradually falling, and looking at the street scene, I knew that it would soon be dark. Two or three beautiful coffee shops on the Champs-Élysées were still open. However, the Fouquet's café, sometimes called the American Club of Paris, was tightly closed. The square, which was usually busy with traffic, the center of transportation, was deserted and empty. The eternal flame next to the tomb of the war dead under the Arc de Triomphe was still burning.

The high-rise buildings and luxurious apartments on the Avenue Foch, which had been empty since July, were unexpectedly bustling at this time. The German army has subtly used these magnificent buildings, and their military vehicles are constantly transporting officers to and from them.

In the early morning, beside the Bois de Boulogne, the German army marched in formation. The sound of their footsteps interrupted the chirping of the birds in the park. A team of young German soldiers in green uniforms stood on the corner, singing military songs loudly. The march and their footsteps formed a harmonious tone. Almost every German troop in the German-occupied area sings this kind of military song. So listening to this march, you will be confused and lost, wondering whether you are really next to the Bois de Boulogne or next to a park in Berlin?

The nearest road to the New Bridge subway station is through a mile-long bridle path in the park, where I encountered a group of German officers riding horses. This scene reminded me of everything I saw in the park in Berlin after the last war. At that time, the German officers riding horses in the park in this semi-communist Berlin city themselves did not feel excited. They were all wearing worn-out military uniforms and riding horses. Now these German officers in Paris are in a very different situation, all wearing brand-new uniforms.

After walking this mile-long lonely road, I reached the subway station. In addition to the subway, which has not been interrupted, Paris has no buses, no taxis, and private cars have also been requisitioned by the government. Everything I see is very different from the past. When I woke up in the morning, all the pleasant atmosphere that Paris used to have had been swept away. Yes, this place is still Paris, and the houses, streets, and some people are still Parisian. But the beauty and gentleness of Paris cannot be found anymore. (To be continued)

### Food: Imported Rice Continues to Arrive Non-Stop, Early Market Rose Briefly on Rumors, New Indica Rice Supply Still Exceeds Demand

Since the imported rice market tightened a week ago, with a day's closure in the middle due to the weekend, yesterday saw renewed optimism. In the early morning, rumors of Saigon's closure spread, causing widespread panic buying. No. 2 Saigon rice was the most sought-after, rising sharply by one yuan in an instant. Other varieties followed suit. However, upon learning that the earlier news was inaccurate, speculators quickly tried to sell, causing the market to falter. Subsequently, Shenji announced an agreement to sell 1,000 tons, with 500 tons of No. 1 Saigon at 78.8 yuan and 500 tons of No. 2 at 75.3 yuan, both ready for immediate loading. Additionally, there were two or three inquiries by telegram, and previously arranged batches were expected to arrive today or tomorrow, with smaller batches already arriving continuously. This led to a slight drop in the market by three to five jiao due to wavering confidence. In the afternoon, both buying and selling slowed, and the market remained weak. If large shipments arrive today and tomorrow, prices are expected to fall again.

More imported rice arrived in Shanghai yesterday. The Taikoo Company's Qiongzhou vessel arrived from Hong Kong carrying 1,000 bags and docked at the company's pier on the Bund in the French Concession at around 2 PM yesterday for unloading. Jardine Matheson's Mingsheng vessel also arrived from Hong Kong with 1,500 bags and docked at Roosevelt Pier at 5 PM yesterday for unloading. The Risheng vessel arrived last night, reportedly carrying rice as well, but the exact amount is unknown. Due to the late hour, details will be reported after investigation today. (Zu)

The source of new indica rice, such as Jianyao and Zhong Baige from the lower reaches of the river and from tricycles, is no less than 2,000 bags. Indica rice accounts for two-thirds of this. Therefore, although the sales of new indica rice and Jianyao Zhong Baige are not weak, the supply still exceeds demand, causing prices to fall by about one yuan. New indica rice from Minhang sold for as high as 78.5 yuan, eventually settling at 76 yuan. Zhongguan Jianyao from Qingjiao was at 78 yuan, and Baige from Xitang was at 77 and 76.5 yuan. Taicang Yangjian remained stable, still opening at 70 yuan per original bag. Dujian from Qingjiao was an exception, rising nearly one yuan due to its scarcity and aroma, opening at 72 yuan per original bag, and settling at 67 yuan per dan. Kejian from Wuhu opened at 62.5 to 62 yuan. As for broken rice, the market was already sparse and the prices were falling, so there was no change in the market. Changbang broken rice was at 82-83 yuan to 80 yuan, Sutong broken rice at 76-77 yuan, and Nangang original bag early rice at 82-83 yuan, settling at 72 yuan per dan. Both national and imported glutinous rice had mediocre sales and remained unchanged. Jinli goods opened at around 72 yuan, and Hong Kong goods were at 71 yuan, settling at 68-69 yuan.

### Chinese Flour Insufficient, Market Remains Firm and Expensive

Flour: Yesterday's market was still advantageous, but trading volume was low. This was due to the fact that the supply from Chinese factories was insufficient and returned goods were completely bought up by hoarders, with asking prices reaching over 19 yuan. As a result, transactions were quite quiet. Imported flour's current inventory is depleted, and new shipments are not expected to arrive for another month, making it a case of "distant water cannot quench immediate thirst." Furthermore, Japanese and mainland flour are also lacking in deliveries to the concessions, so sentiment is naturally positive. Yesterday, it was heard that the factory price remained unchanged, and the quantity of shipments was reduced. Retail outlets still lacked supply. The customer price for Chinese flour remained at 18.5 yuan, and the price of Gaopai imported flour rose to 19.5-6 yuan. Muke saw a slight improvement, but the overall situation is that a large shipment of imported flour is expected soon, and the market may have difficulty standing firm.

Wheat: Yesterday's supply was even scarcer as vehicle transport was obstructed, and the amount transported into the concessions was extremely rare. Therefore, asking prices from sellers were quite high. However, Japanese factories limited purchase prices to around 21 yuan, while Chinese factories did not make any formal purchases. There were also no new transactions from the mainland or other regions.

### Financial Commentary (Continued)

— St. Catherington

— October 12 —

Although Japan currently appears strong on the surface but is weak internally, it still seeks to realize its aggressive ambitions by exploiting opportunities while controlling Vietnam. Former Admiral Takahashi of the Japanese Combined Fleet stated that Japan should not fear US interference and must continue its southward advance. Today is the last opportunity for Japan to progress southward. Japan must place Vietnam and the Dutch East Indies within its sphere of influence to resolve the "China Incident." While a US economic blockade will be detrimental to Japan, it can be offset by the oil, iron, and rubber from the Dutch East Indies and Vietnam. Therefore, Japan's outward display of moderation, calmness, and patience is merely a disguise for its inner anger, impatience, and scheming. Frankly speaking, after controlling Vietnam, Japan will sooner or later seize the Dutch East Indies, which will sooner or later lead to conflict with the United States. A war between Japan and the US will inevitably occur in the Pacific. Once Japan is able to seize the Dutch East Indies, it will no longer fear the economic warfare waged by the UK and the US, as what cannot be obtained from them can be compensated for by Vietnam and the Dutch East Indies. As for Vietnam, it produces 7 million tons of rice annually. Besides rice, its cotton, corn, sesame, soybeans, peanuts, and sugarcane production are also extremely abundant. Even its rubber production reaches 60,000 tons per year. As for underground resources, it produces 2.4 million tons of coal annually, of which 60% is Hongji anthracite. It also produces 34,000 tons of ore, including over 16,000 tons of iron-containing ore, over 2,500 tons of manganese ore, and over 1,600 tons of tin. Japan has consistently run a trade deficit with Vietnam. The Dutch East Indies are even more important to Japan than Vietnam. Among the Dutch East Indies' abundant resources: it produces 1.4 million tons of sugar annually, 180,000 tons of rubber, over 10,000 tons of quinine, and 74 million tons of tin. These account for 30% to 90% of global production. Additionally, it produces 8 million tons of crude oil annually. Therefore, the Dutch East Indies are the best region for obtaining resources and developing markets, both militarily and economically. In fact, Japan will not abandon the Dutch East Indies under any circumstances. Once Japan seizes the Dutch East Indies through cunning or force, the United States will inevitably resort to war to maintain security in the Pacific and protect its economic interests. This possibility will not occur in the distant future, but in the very near future. When that time comes, the Far East war will expand, and only legal tender will be usable. The exchange rate of legal tender will undoubtedly lengthen naturally.

Here, I sincerely advise speculators in the foreign exchange market to stop using their valuable funds for speculation. I dare to say that there is no profit to be made from foreign exchange speculation in the future, and due to the changing situation, it will inevitably lead to losses sooner or later. The recent interest rate cuts by banks have implicitly indicated this trend. To strengthen the security of your funds and increase the accumulation of your funds, the only option is to strengthen the forces of resistance and national reconstruction -- strive to recognize the national savings program, which is not only safe and reliable but also offers generous interest. Compared to speculation in foreign exchange, the resulting benefits are far incomparable due to the difference in labor and leisure, not to mention that speculation is currently more likely to fail. People who are speculating, quickly shift your mindset from seeking speculative profits to seeking legitimate investment profits, and strive to recognize savings in support of national reconstruction!

### Finance: Gold Market Short Squeeze Turns Upward in Afternoon

Yesterday's spot gold futures market saw a tired trend in the morning session after a bearish dark market. However, the market suddenly rose in the afternoon, driven by the shift from loose to tight in the exchange market and rumors of positive news from abroad, which stirred up sentiment. At one point before the close, it surged to a peak of 5,690 yuan. It was rumored that a securities firm with long positions aggressively added to its holdings, and those who had been short selling for several days were forced to cover due to lack of delivery. However, the closing price settled at 5,658 yuan due to a slight easing in the US exchange rate and continued selling by a money exchange. This was a short squeeze increase of 78 yuan compared to last weekend, with a total trading volume of 4,000 taels. Gold jewelry shops increased prices by 10 yuan, while customs gold and others remained unchanged.

Spot Futures Up 78 Yuan

The market initially opened with a soft sentiment, falling by a small margin of 20 yuan. A money exchange sold 20 taels to a silver firm for 5,550 yuan. Lai Gold Firm subsequently bought, pushing the price up to 5,565 yuan. However, money exchanges and silver firms sold heavily again, causing the price to drop to a low of 5,520 yuan. At that time, limited-price buyers came in, halting the decline. Soon after, two money exchanges competed to cover their shorts, and the spot gold market was also strong. As a result, the closing price recovered to 5,560 yuan. In the afternoon, the market opened up 20 yuan, with a silver firm buying 30 taels from a gold firm for 5,580 yuan. Later, due to selling by a money exchange, the price fell slightly to 5,565 yuan. However, retail investors were quite willing to buy in, driving the price upwards again. When it reached 5,590 yuan, a securities firm suddenly bought in, pushing the price above the 5,600 yuan mark. The securities firm continued to buy aggressively, and silver firms and money exchanges rushed to cover their shorts. At the same time, the exchange market was weak and there were rumors of positive news. Although a money exchange continued to sell from time to time, its positions still felt insufficient. The price soon surged to 5,690 yuan. After that, the number of buyers decreased, and securities firms and retail investors took profits. The closing price fell back to 5,650 yuan. The final closing price was 5,658 yuan, a short squeeze increase of 78 yuan compared to last weekend. The total daily fluctuation was 170 yuan. The selling price of spot gold firms was over ten yuan higher than the spot futures price, while the purchase price was over thirty yuan lower. The current bid price was over fifty yuan lower than the listed gold price. There was little trading activity.

Jewelry Prices Also Increased by 10 Yuan

The price of jewelry in silver shops initially remained unchanged, but at 2:40 PM, it increased by 10 yuan. The price at the Da Tong Hang was changed to 580 yuan, and the price at the Xin Tong Hang was the same. The purchase price was lowered by about 30 yuan.

### Foreign Exchange Buying Spree Continues

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw HSBC announce rates, with the British and US rates each increasing by 0.125, resulting in 3 shillings 6.875 pence and 5 yuan 6.25 fen, respectively. Other exchange rates also increased across the board. The dark market for British and US exchange rates initially loosened then tightened, following a winding trend. The after-market saw a sudden rise in buying interest from speculators, such as the Guangdong group, due to rumors of positive overseas news. The market tightened to 3 shillings 7.8125 pence and 5 yuan 7.5 fen. However, the closing rate for British gold remained at 3 shillings 7.8125 pence, while the US exchange rate was 5 yuan 7.8125 fen, a tightening of 0.03125 and 0.0625, respectively, compared to last weekend.

The morning began with overseas exchange rates, with British versus US and versus Shanghai staying flat. The US exchange rate was closed. The central rate for each exchange remained unchanged. Banks opened with spot selling prices in the morning, with British gold at 3 shillings 8.28125 pence and the US exchange rate at 5 yuan 8.125 fen, with British flat and US tightening by 0.03125 compared to Saturday. Afterwards, Chinese banks initially sold, and foreign banks with beneficial terms were willing to supply at the opening price, leading the market to loosen and flatten. Chinese banks sold October US exchange rates to a US bank at 5 yuan 8.75 fen. HSBC announced rates, with British and US each increasing by 0.125. The white silver balance tax was unchanged. Afterwards, the market was very quiet, and the trend was stagnant. Speculators bought October and November US exchange rates at 5 yuan 8.4375 fen and 8.75 fen. Later, foreign banks absorbed beneficial spot US exchange rates at 5 yuan 8.4375 fen. Afterwards, there was even less trading activity. Until the close of the morning session, British gold loosened to 3 shillings 8.28125 pence, and the US exchange rate was at 5 yuan 8.4375 fen.

The initial trend of the after-market was still flat. At 2:10 PM, speculators intended to close out October US exchange rates at 5 yuan 8.4375 fen, but were unsuccessful. Soon after, due to certain rumors, the Guangdong group took the lead in covering, and other speculators followed suit. The market suddenly weakened, with the current month US exchange rate opening at 5 yuan 8.125 fen and 7.8125 fen. At 3:30 PM, the spot market also tightened to 3 shillings 7.8125 pence and 5 yuan 7.5 fen. The buying spree finally subsided before the close, and the market slightly recovered. By the evening close, British gold was at 3 shillings 7.8125 pence, and the US exchange rate was at 5 yuan 7.8125 fen. November British gold was at 3 shillings 7.65625 pence, and the US exchange rate was at 5 yuan 7.5 fen. As a result, the current period for British gold tightened by 0.03125, while the US softened by 0.0625 compared to last weekend.

Hong Kong, 14th (Monday) Telegram: The exchange market opened flat this morning, with British stable and the US fluctuating. British exchange rate for current and forward and the Japanese exchange rate for current remained unchanged. The US exchange rate for current tightened by 0.0625, to 21 yuan 8.75 fen. The Shanghai exchange rate for current increased by 1 yuan, to 390 yuan. At 10:10, stable. The US exchange rate for current loosened by 0.0625, to 22 yuan 9.375 fen. At 11:30, stable. The Shanghai exchange rate for current continued to increase by 1 yuan, to 391 yuan. The rest unchanged. The afternoon session opened at 2:30, bull stable. All exchange rates unchanged. At 3:40, stable. The US exchange rate for current further softened by 0.0625, to 22 yuan 8.75 fen. The Shanghai exchange rate for current increased by 3 yuan, to 394 yuan.

Tianjin, 14th (Monday) Telegram: The exchange market opened flat this morning. Exchange rates for British and table telegraphic transfer were stable, with no fluctuations. The Shanghai exchange rate decreased slightly by 0.25 yuan compared to Friday, to 105.5 yuan. "Lianchao" dark market continued to increase by 1 yuan, to 74.5 yuan.

### Most Foreign Currencies Rise

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw spot gold futures initially remain stable, but rumors of positive news emerged in the afternoon, causing prices to surge. British and US gold pounds also initially stabilized and then rose, ultimately increasing by two yuan compared to last Saturday. The British gold bill saw balanced supply and demand, and the market price remained flat. The US gold bill initially fell to 16 yuan 5.5 fen, but the exchange market suddenly tightened in the afternoon with strong rumors of positive news, causing demand to surge from all sides. At 3:45, it rose to a high of 16 yuan 8.3 fen, an increase of 9 fen compared to last Saturday. The Hong Kong bill fell and then recovered. Japanese gold bills and Korean banknotes took advantage of the trend and became quite weak, with market prices trending downwards uniformly. The former fell to 1 yuan 3.5 fen, while the latter fell to 1 yuan 1.4 fen.

### Securities: Internal Debt Revolves

In the securities dark market, yesterday's trend was revolving, with the sentiment of various groups being very slack. This was because various news in the environment was brewing and waiting to change. Yesterday, the volume of buying and selling by various groups was very limited, and the market sentiment was very slack. As soon as there was a slight increase, someone would sell and press it down, and then someone would buy back in, revolving between one and two jiao of the market price from beginning to end. The transactions were nothing more than ins and outs of a small number of people on the table. The total amount of transactions was about 700,000 to 800,000 yuan. The simple table is listed below.

Stock Trading: 100 shares of New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory were traded at a price of 24 yuan and 7.5 fen.

The stock market opened yesterday at the Public Industry Exchange, and the trend was slightly volatile. Initially, the market was pushed downstream due to a large number of short sellers. Subsequently, the prices of other stocks were raised due to continuous purchases of Jardine Matheson shares. The morning session closed with a strong underlying trend. Although there was a strong trend of taking profits in the afternoon, the public's absorption was also good.

### Yarn and Cotton: Japanese Factories Reduce Production, Cotton Yarn Surges, Spot Double Horse Raised to 1,250 Yuan in Afternoon

The yarn market, which had been revolving for many days, rose again yesterday. This was because there was still no hope of clearing the source of raw materials, and Japanese factories were significantly reducing production. At the same time, the Guangdong group had an urgent need for 23-count and 10-count coarse yarn. Rumors were rampant in the market, all favorable to bulls. As a result, the buying spree was extremely fierce, and the market price gradually advanced. 20-count Double Horse reappeared at a new peak. Today, there are 1,930 bales of cotton yarn being transported to Hong Kong.

The opening price of the current yarn market rose, inheriting the enthusiastic sentiment from last weekend. The first price for 20-count Double Horse was 1,190 yuan. After a while, it fell to 1,178 yuan. Soon after, it was heard that Japanese yarn had risen sharply, which excited people and a buying spree started suddenly, rising directly to 1,203 yuan. At this time, bulls slightly took profits, and it fell back to 1,197 yuan. After 11:00 AM, the buying voices suddenly vibrated, and the sentiment became strong. There were only buyers, and very few sellers. The market rose again to 1,222 yuan at closing. The half-day transaction statistics were 5,990 bales. The price of 20-count Double Horse rose by 54 yuan. After the closing, it continued to rise. The amounts bought by various groups are listed as follows:

Fellow Traders: 3,770, Hong Kong: 2,220, Total: 5,990

In the afternoon, the yarn market heard of another surge, and the bullish forces were exceptionally active. Because there was talk of another limit-up for Blue Phoenix Brand yarn, there were buying voices throughout the market. 20-count Double Horse reached 1,250 yuan. The situation in the first half of the year seemed to be making a comeback. It is certainly a big jump at present. Whether the future is good or bad, I dare not predict.

### Cotton Brought Up Quite a Bit

The situation of current cotton turned for the better, due to the jump in the yarn market, which brought up the sentiment of the people. However, the factory's sales are still not smooth, because Japanese factories are reducing production. However, the minds of those holding goods are very active. Today, there are 560 bales of cotton being transported to Hong Kong.

Another piece of news: In the foreign cotton market, yesterday was Columbus Day in the New York cotton market, and the entire city suspended trading for one day. The Indian market was also very quiet. It is heard that the forecast is for a rise of more than half a rupee.

The trading of imported cotton in Shanghai has been very firm recently, especially long-fiber cotton. The stock on the market is not abundant, and fellow traders are unwilling to sell, so the price of cotton has been rising, but it has not been possible to obtain huge profits. The minds of all parties are exceptionally active, so it is generally expected that the cotton market will continue to rise.

### Piece Goods: Hoarders Active, Selling Offers Rise

Domestic Cloth: Yesterday's cloth market surged, because fellow traders and hoarders were enthusiastically speculating. Although actual sales did not show expansion, the buying sentiment was very strong. Selling offers rose uniformly. White goods, fine cloth, and fine twill rose by 0.5 to 1 yuan per bolt, coarse cloth rose by 0.25 to 0.5 yuan, bleached and dyed cloth and flannel rose by 0.5 to 1 yuan, serge, straight tribute, and other fine yarn thread blank cloth rose by 1 to 1.5 yuan. More than 2,000 pieces of various goods were traded in the street. Most of them were sales and purchases by fellow traders. Guangdong and Hong Kong groups traded more than 300 pieces of twill colored cloth and other goods. Yantai groups traded more than 200 pieces of flannel, coarse cloth, and colored twill. Transportation on the Zhejiang Road, Wen Yong, and Furong were not smooth, but because the price of goods rose, they also purchased more than 200 pieces of coarse cloth, colored twill, and other goods for storage and loading.

Eastern Cloth: Yesterday, because yarn and thread were rising, people inside and outside the industry were optimistic about rising prices and buying was vigorous. 12-pound Longtou fine cloth surged by 1.5 yuan per bolt. The high price was over 38 yuan 4 jiao. The closing price was 38 yuan 1 jiao 5 fen. Fine twill also rose by about 1 yuan per bolt. The surge in the Four Gentlemen serge was very intense. The top selling price was over 1 yuan 1 jiao 6 fen 7.5 li per yard. The closing price was 1 yuan 1 jiao 5 fen 7 li 5 hao, a sharp increase of 6 fen 3.75 li per yard compared to last weekend.

Export: 100 pieces of cotton cloth were shipped to Hong Kong today, and 200 pieces were shipped to Tianjin.

### Women's Coat Materials Sell Especially Well

Mohair, sea tiger velvet, lamb velvet, long-haired velvet, and spiral four velvet, etc., have had a large number of retail and wholesale transactions recently. Women's clothing stores in various places have had strong demand, because actual sales have started with the cold weather, and door-to-door customization is increasing daily. Among them, the transactions of long and short-haired Haibailong velvet have been particularly large. Yesterday, Three Camel Brand long-haired velvet was sold in bulk for 56 yuan per yard, and miscellaneous brands were around 50 yuan. Ordinary short-haired velvet was selling for 46-47 yuan, mohair for 60 yuan, sea tiger velvet for 45-46 yuan, and lamb velvet for 40 yuan. A custom-made women's coat made of long-haired velvet (i.e., Haibailong) now requires 170-180 legal tender. Last year at this time, it was only 110-120 yuan, and the year before last, it was only 70 yuan. It can be seen that the price of clothing has risen sharply.

### Miscellaneous Grains: Soybean Market Flat

In the recent soybean market, because the export route is not connected, the sales in the street are affected by hawkers and merchants transporting new beans from nearby villages directly to bean curd shops, so the overall situation is hindered and the underlying trend is flat. However, the price of oil has not dropped significantly, and transportation is difficult and the cost is high, resulting in the trend of small price increases. Yesterday, 150 bags of Qingdao beans were traded at a price of 36 yuan, 30 bags of Taicang beans at 33 yuan, 50 bags of Dachang beans at 32 yuan, 30 bags of Beixinjing beans at 33 yuan 1 jiao, and 300 bags of Tianjin beans on the road at 44 yuan 5 jiao, it is said.

Yesterday (14th), 2,250 tins of raw oil and 1,570 tins of soybean oil were shipped from Qingdao.

### Sugar Market: Sugar Prices Fluctuate

Yesterday, sugar prices fluctuated, but the trend was still stable. The association's board set the prices for spot goods, with 24 coarse white foreign warehouse goods at 74 yuan 9 jiao, up 1 jiao, transit goods at 58 yuan 5 jiao, down 0.5 jiao, Dutch cotton white at 72 yuan 4 jiao, Dutch red continuing to rise 7 jiao to 57 yuan, Taikoo car white B mark at 72 yuan 7 jiao, up 2 jiao, DY mark at 70 yuan, down 0.4 jiao, HX mark at 69 yuan 2 jiao, down 0.6 jiao, and H mark car red at 56 yuan 7 jiao.

### Northern and Southern Goods: Black Dates Up More Than 20 Yuan

Since the introduction of new black dates, the initial price was quite flat. However, due to exchange rate relations, the cost has increased, so the asking price has continued to rise. Yesterday, a small number opened, and Gaozhuang reached as high as 96 yuan, rising by more than 20 yuan.

### Coal: Bituminous Coal Supply and Demand in Equilibrium

Recently, the coal market has seen prices rise since the interruption of Hongji coal supplies. However, due to ample existing stocks of bituminous coal, and with various factories cautiously making purchases, the supply and demand remain relatively balanced, and there have been no significant fluctuations in sales prices. Yesterday's prices were: Indian bituminous coal at $205 per ton, lump coal at $210 per ton. The above prices are after trade discounts, ex-warehouse, with lighterage and cartage at the buyer's expense. Door-to-door deliveries are subject to additional charges.

### Metals: Straits Tin - Scarce Goods, Firm Prices

The Straits tin market, which had been quiet for some time, is currently facing a situation where no new shipments are arriving from overseas, and the existing stocks in Shanghai are low. Market sentiment is positive, and prices remain firm. Historically, the primary use for this tin has been for rollers in cotton mills. However, with many cotton mills relocating, business has declined. Even those that have not relocated are unable to procure the tin due to the high prices. Furthermore, lock factories and machine factories are also refraining from purchasing due to the high cost. Current market transactions are limited to small-scale transactions by a few hardware stores. The current prices are $1,000 for 24-gauge tin and $500 for 26-gauge tin.

### Aniseed Tightening

Aniseed is experiencing a persistent shortage of arrivals, leading to dwindling stocks in the market. Asking prices continue to rise. The previous market price was $250, but it has now risen to $260. Some are even asking for $300, indicating that the tight supply situation has not eased.

The Post-War Chinese Silk Industry (Continued from the 12th) by Shi Xiang

If one has a hundred dan of dry cocoons, calculated at 380 catties per dan for silk reeling, one can produce 31 dan of silk, resulting in a loss of $970 per dan. Thus, the spring season's operations would incur a loss of over $30,000. If the raw materials collected could produce 80 dan of silk, the loss would reach $78,000. According to current estimates, small silk factories in Wuxi are fortunate if their losses are only between $30,000 and $50,000. The outcome for those with outstanding debts is even more uncertain.

(C) Various Difficulties

While exporting new silk faces difficulties, most silk workers have no choice but to seek ways to make a living. At the same time, transportation companies specializing in shipping silk for manufacturers are also seeking solutions. As a result, they pay $300 to obtain a transportation permit. With this, a few batches of new silk can be shipped to Shanghai, but most of the silk stored inland cannot be shipped as desired, as everyone wants to wait for an opportunity to ship it. However, in the past month, permits have disappeared, and no one has been able to obtain them. Therefore, the silk market in Shanghai has been quiet recently. Looking back at the silk factories in Shanghai, since the outbreak of the war in eastern Zhejiang, the ports have been blocked, and not a single cocoon can be transported to Shanghai. Only five or six factories are operating, and their remaining raw materials are only sufficient to reel until the end of March. The decline of the Chinese silk industry is inevitable.

Small factories are constantly facing their demise, and the 12% construction special tax is adding insult to injury. If the price is assessed at $4,000, each dan would be subject to a tax of $480. Subsequently, silk merchants from various regions expressed their distress, so the tax for the spring season this year was temporarily set at $110 per dan. Whether the tax will be increased in the future is reportedly not yet concretely decided. (The End)

### Amidst Rumors of Two American Liners Arriving, American Nationals in Shanghai Prepare; Most Believe Situation Growing Serious; Consulate Ordered to Handle Necessary Procedures

American nationals in this port are eagerly anticipating the news of the Washington and Manhattan liners being dispatched to the Far East to evacuate American citizens. The majority here believe that the US government's dispatch of these two liners indicates that the Far Eastern situation is more serious than previously imagined. During the weekend investigation by reporters, some Americans believed that war between the US and Japan was unlikely in the Far East, and therefore adopted a wait-and-see attitude towards the State Department's recommendation that "non-essential" Americans leave the Far East. However, since the news was released that the two liners had been ordered to leave New York on the 12th to come to Shanghai, American nationals here have begun to prepare for evacuation, packing their belongings and sending their wives and children back home first. Male employees of major American commercial firms, however, have expressed their determination to stay in Shanghai.

Two Large Liners, Richly Equipped

Yesterday's report in this newspaper, citing a Washington dispatch, stated that the US government had dispatched the two giant liners, the Washington and Manhattan, to various locations in the Far East to transport American nationals back home. These two giant liners belong to the United States Lines and are represented by the American President Lines in this city, operating on the Atlantic route, namely from New York to Naples (Italy) and Genoa. They have a gross tonnage of 40,000 tons, a net tonnage of 24,289 tons, a length of 705 feet, and a width of 86 feet, which is more than 20% larger than the American mail steamer President Coolidge, which operates on the Pacific route. They are similar to the Empress of Britain, a giant liner of the World Class of the British Changxing Company (visiting Shanghai once a year, but not entering the Huangpu River, anchoring outside the Wusong Estuary). The two giant liners are sister ships with the same tonnage and hull. Passenger accommodations are divided into different classes. The Manhattan has 69 first-class, 98 second-class, 24 third-class, and 26 fourth-class seats. The Washington has 69 first-class (same), 98 second-class (same), 19 third-class (5 fewer), and 25 fourth-class seats (1 fewer). The internal facilities are roughly the same, including restaurants, smoking rooms, swimming pools, deck tennis courts, elevators, and in-room bathrooms. Everything is available and extremely luxurious, equivalent to a palace on the sea. According to the American President Lines, they have not yet received a cable from the head office regarding the two giant liners operating in the Far East to transport the nationals back. It is expected that due to the government requisition, there is no news temporarily. The news must be made official after the departure of the two liners.

Reserved Berths Not Yet Crowded

However, some American nationals went to the company yesterday to inquire and planned to reserve cabin space on the two giant liners. The company was unable to process the procedures because it has not received notice from the head office, and politely declined. According to the Acting American Consul General, Mr. Blodgett, some of the notices issued to American nationals have been answered, but the applications for booking berths and preparing to evacuate are not yet crowded. The president of the American Chamber of Commerce in this port, Mr. Smith, told reporters that the American Chamber of Commerce has not made any decisions on this matter, and believes that the handling of this matter by the American Consulate General is very satisfactory to the general public. According to Mr. Fanklin, an American lawyer and former Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, "I still do not understand why my family should not stay here with me."

Ambassador's Family Returning Home on Scheduled Route

Reuters reported from Peiping on the 14th that the families of the guards of the American Embassy, ​​a total of dozens of women and children, are packing their luggage and leaving Peiping under the order of the US Navy. There are currently 540 American nationals in Peiping, of whom 70 have requested to leave Peiping as soon as possible, and another 100 want to leave the country when the situation deteriorates. The rest are unwilling to leave unless the situation becomes extremely serious. Mrs. Johnson, the wife of the American Ambassador, and her two children, as well as some family members of the American Embassy staff, are scheduled to depart from Shanghai on the President Coolidge on November 7.

Most American Nationals Prepare to Leave

The English-language Da Mei Evening News stated that American nationals in this city (14th) are speculating on the news that the United States has dispatched the Washington and Manhattan liners to evacuate Americans from the Far East. Many Americans believe that the US government's dispatch of these two liners shows that the situation in the Far East is far more serious than previously thought. According to the investigation conducted by reporters at the end of the week, most American nationals in Shanghai are packing their luggage and preparing to leave the country. However, there are also many American nationals who believe that "no changes will occur."

### US Flagship Augusta Reportedly to Leave Shanghai Tomorrow; US Reservists in Shanghai to Depart This Week; 21 Will Board Flagship for Duty

The English-language Da Mei Evening News reported that, according to sources in this city this morning (14th), the flagship Augusta of the US Asiatic Fleet is expected to leave Shanghai on Wednesday (i.e., tomorrow), destination unknown. When reporters asked US naval officers on the Augusta about this, they neither confirmed nor denied it.

Shanghai Reservists Boarding Ship for Duty

American naval reservists in Shanghai are expected to board the Augusta this week. It is reported that of the 60 American naval reservists in this city, about 21 will definitely serve on the flagship. The rest will soon return to the United States to take up shore duties. Last night (13th), the American Naval Reserve in this city held its last dinner at the American Fleet Reserve Club.

Liner Waiters Called Up

It is also reported that several waiters on the American mail steamer Cafeir President, which berthed in Shanghai yesterday, will leave the ship upon arrival in Manila to join the US Fleet for duty, as they are all members of the US Naval Reserve and have received orders to be transferred to the US Navy.

Consulate Continues to Issue Notices

As far as the entire American community is concerned, the agitation initially caused by the US State Department's recommendation that "non-essential" Americans leave the Far East has now largely dissipated. The US Consulate has been sending notices urging evacuation to registered Americans in the city over the past two days. According to a written statement from the US Consulate, the Consulate will send these notices to all registered Americans and will also send these notices to unregistered Americans.

Form Attached to Survey Numbers

The notice contains the announcement issued by the US State Department last week, advising Americans to return home. The notice includes a form for Americans to fill out the number of people in their family, so that the shipping company can process the information easily. It was reported from Shanghai today that employees of Texaco Oil Company in North China have received notices to return home, while employees of Mobil Oil, Citibank, and Texaco Oil in this city received similar notices to evacuate the Far East last week.

### Preparations Actively Underway for Reopening of Yunnan-Burma Road and Resumption of Joint Transportation; Shipping Companies Increase Shipments to Handle Cargo; French Ships Arrive in Shanghai Daily and Head Directly to Haiphong

With the Yunnan-Burma Road scheduled to reopen on the 18th (Friday), foreign firms in this port are actively preparing to transport goods via this route. According to news from foreign import and export firms, American, British, French, and other merchants in Shanghai, now that the transportation route has been restored, are placing large orders with the Chinese interior for various important metal raw materials such as tungsten, tin, aluminum, and tung oil, which will be exported via the Yunnan-Burma Road. As for the tungsten ore purchased by the US government from China, more than 15,000 tons have been concentrated in Kunming, waiting for an opportunity to be loaded and exported.

Inland Transportation Route

There are no regular ships between Shanghai and Yangon. Irregular ships occasionally make direct voyages. Normally, most goods are transshipped via Singapore. Because the Yunnan-Burma Road is opening on the 18th, British and American shipping companies have decided to increase ships operating between Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Yangon. If necessary, a new direct route between Shanghai and Yangon may be opened. In the future, goods from Shanghai to Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou provinces will be transported to Yangon, and then transferred to the southwest and northwest provinces via the Yunnan-Burma Highway. However, the transportation costs will be slightly higher than transferring via the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway or the Zhejiang-Wenzhou-Ningbo route.

Preparing for Domestic Sales

The goods produced by factories in Shanghai are mainly sold to the southwest and northwest provinces. Since the Yunnan-Burma Road was temporarily closed, it has been impossible to import goods into the interior, resulting in accumulated inventory and falling prices, with virtually no sales. Since hearing that the Yunnan-Burma Road is reopening, all industries have been greatly encouraged and believe that goods can be imported via the Yunnan-Burma Road, and Shanghai's industry and commerce will be able to recover. This is what Shanghai's industry and commerce sectors have been looking forward to. It is reported that specialists have been dispatched to Yangon to discuss matters related to joint transportation between Shanghai, Sichuan, Guizhou, and Yunnan.

Direct Connection to Shanghai-Haiphong

At a time when British ships have suspended service to ports in Vietnam, French ships are still operating between Shanghai and Haiphong without interruption. It is understood that several French ships will operate between Haiphong and Saigon in the near future. On the 20th of this month, the Ross ship will depart directly from Shanghai to Haiphong. The ship is scheduled to arrive on the 18th and will berth at the Suntai Wharf in Hongkou. The second ship, the Yarrow, will also arrive on the 18th and depart on the 23rd. These two ships will arrive on the same day, carrying 7,500 tons, or 80,000 bags, of imported rice from Saigon. As for the Kindia ship, it will arrive in Shanghai on the 25th, berth at the Huacheng Wharf, and depart directly from Shanghai to Haiphong and Saigon on the 27th, also carrying cargo. In addition, a large Datnan mail ship will also arrive here at the end of this month. All of the above-mentioned ships are managed by the French Post Office Company at No. 9, the Bund, in the French Concession. In the future, goods and tribute rice from Saigon and other places can be transported to Shanghai by French mail ships without any doubt. As for when British ships will resume service, it remains to be decided by the British Admiralty.

### French Tram Strike Nearing Resolution

Half a month after the French tram company workers went on strike, the transportation has been disrupted and the people are upset. According to the news agency, its reporters learned from reliable sources that labor and management of the company are gradually approaching a resolution, and that the disagreement exists only in some of the specific articles, which are expected to be resolved soon. Therefore, the strike is expected to be settled soon, and the public will soon see all trams and buses resume operation in the French Concession.

### Three Major Oil Companies Reduce Operations, Central China Operations Become Monopolized, Transportation No Longer Possible as Desired

The foreign-owned Asiatic Petroleum Company, Standard-Vacuum Oil Company, and Texaco, the three major oil companies, used to hold a dominant position in China's oil industry. Since the outbreak of the war, their operational scope has been forced to shrink. Recently, the Japanese side has further restricted the issuance of oil transport permits to these three companies, making it extremely difficult for them to transport oil to the occupied areas of Central China for sale. They can only hand over the oil to Japanese merchants for transshipment. In fact, the oil industry in Central China has become a monopoly. Previously, the three companies could obtain oil transport permits from the Japanese Oil Merchants Association when transporting oil to the occupied areas of Central China, but now this is no longer possible. It is said that the only oil merchant who can currently obtain oil transport permits is the Chusan Company, which is run by a Japanese.

### Establishment of the Grain Administration, Unified Authority, Agricultural Credit Administration's Price Stabilization Matters Transferred Entirely to Jurisdiction

The National Government authorities are making every effort to regulate wartime food supplies. The National Grain Administration has now been formally established, and its internal organizational structure has also been fully established. The price stabilization of grain and other matters formerly under the jurisdiction of the Agricultural Credit Administration of the Ministry of Economic Affairs have been entirely transferred to the jurisdiction of the Grain Administration, effective this month, since the Grain Administration has been established. The original Grain Commission has also been merged at the same time. Hereafter, all matters related to grain issues nationwide will be entirely the responsibility of the Grain Administration.

### Protest Against Major Theft Case, Japanese Consul Still Has No Reply

Regarding the case of Japanese military police obstructing the Shanghai Municipal Council Police from arresting the Swiss thief Wehrt, the Swiss Consul General in Shanghai, Fontanel, was still awaiting a reply yesterday from the Japanese Consul General Horiuchi regarding his protest. According to Fontanel, he submitted a note to Japanese Consul Horiuchi on Saturday (the 12th) regarding the actions of the Japanese military police and requested cooperation in arresting the thief. At that time, Japanese Consul Horiuchi said he would reply soon.

### In Memory of the Austrian Psychiatrist Professor Wagner-Jauregg (1) - The Overcomer of General Paralysis of the Insane

— Written by Hanfen — Translated by Xia Chu

Julius Wagner-Jauregg, the director of the Vienna Psychiatric Hospital, recently passed away in Austria. Previously, our government had requested Wagner-Jauregg to send someone to China to guide psychiatric medical affairs. He then sent his outstanding student, Dr. Fanny G. Haipern, to China in 1933 to serve. Wagner-Jauregg was extremely concerned about the progress of psychiatry in China and provided appropriate guidance on various pathologies. He was particularly interested in the thyroid goiter commonly seen in western China. The brain charts currently used in our country's medical schools are also taken from the Vienna Psychiatric Hospital. After Wagner-Jauregg's death, medical circles around the world expressed their condolences for this most contributing medical figure. Dr. Hanfen is currently a professor of psychiatry at the St. John's University Medical School in Shanghai and a neurologist at the Red Cross Neurological Clinic at 1771 Yu Yuan Road. Recently, at the urging of friends in the medical community, she wrote an article in memory of her teacher. With Dr. Hanfen's permission, we are translating and publishing this article in our newspaper for the benefit of the nation.

Professor Wagner-Jauregg was the inventor of malaria therapy for the treatment of general paralysis of the insane, and also the winner of the 1928 Nobel Prize. Now he has passed away at the age of eighty-three. When the news came, not only the medical community mourned him, but also the general public, as long as they cared about these warriors fighting against the god of death, all felt regret.

From 1924 to 1933, I had the honor of being taught by this master of psychiatry at the University of Vienna and studying with him. As the old saying goes, "Only a good person can be a good doctor." This is undoubtedly true for Professor Wagner-Jauregg. All those who had a private relationship with him, all those who worked with him, now not only feel that they have lost their mentor, but also lost a good friend; although they may be separated from him by vast distances, they are still guided and inspired by him at all times.

He endowed mankind with the ability to eradicate general paralysis, but the impression he gave you was definitely not that of a revolutionary. The wrinkles on his face had become his trademark, his eyes were deep and kind, and year after year you could see him pacing back and forth in the dark Vienna Psychiatric Hospital. He never wore fancy clothes, always wearing a black felt brimmed hat, winter or summer, dressed in black, with an old-fashioned collar turned up and an old-fashioned black tie—everyone in the streets of Vienna knew him like that.

He was a true doctor, he loved nature, he observed nature, and he knew how to draw practical conclusions from observation. What he considered most important was the treatment of disease and the health of patients. These were much more important than interesting experiments or moving hypotheses. Any exaggerated or overly theoretical scientific work had no connection with him, but he was tolerant and treated everything with kindness and sympathy. (To be continued)

### American Journalist Enlists, Volunteers to Serve in British Army, Departs Shanghai Yesterday with Companions

The English-language *Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury* reported that the latest batch of foreign nationals residing in Shanghai who volunteered for the British Army will depart Shanghai before this evening (the 14th) for Singapore. Some of them will be transferred from Singapore to Egypt to join the British Army forces. P.R. O'Keane, a well-known American journalist in Shanghai, is also among the group of foreign nationals enlisting in the British Army departing today. It is reported that after graduating from university, O'Keane covered news in the Italian invasion of Abyssinia and the Spanish Civil War, providing reports to several American newspapers. During the war between the Soviet Union and Finland, O'Keane planned to enlist in the Finnish army, but his plan was suspended due to the armistice between the Soviet Union and Finland. O'Keane has been in Shanghai for just over a year.

### Continued Sale of Rice at Stabilized Prices, Decision to Open Sales from November 1, Rice Price Assessment Committee to Assess and Set New Price Limits Today

The Committee for Stabilizing Rice Prices held its 16th Standing Committee meeting at 2:00 PM yesterday at its office at 93 Guangdong Road. Chairman Yu Qiaqing reported that (1) the second round of donations, up to October 12, totaled $299,973.76, and (2) the sixth phase of sales at stabilized prices involved 25,200 bags of rice. The following was then discussed: (1) It was decided to continue with another phase from November 1 until the remaining rice is sold out, and (2) the target for this round of donations is 600,000 yuan to cover losses from sales at stabilized prices. Since only half of this amount has been collected, efforts should be made to solicit donations from all industries and sectors to meet the target. At the same time, the Deputy Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Mr. Hederque, wrote to the committee expressing the Council's willingness to assist with stabilizing rice prices and to solicit donations from Chinese and foreign individuals. If necessary, he is also willing to nominate representatives to participate.

Today's Price Assessment

The Rice Price Assessment Committee decided to hold a full committee meeting at 3:00 PM today at its office at 15 Avenue Edward VII. All committee members are expected to attend on time to seriously discuss new price limits for domestic and imported rice and to announce them to the market for strict implementation. If any fellow merchants are found to be privately trading in the market, they will be severely punished according to regulations. It is reported that representatives from both the foreign concessions and the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce will be appointed to attend and provide guidance.

Imported Rice Transactions

Various rice businesses have completed the transaction for the purchase of 1,000 tons (i.e., 10,000 bags) of imported rice yesterday. 5,000 bags of No. 1 Spanish rice and 5,000 bags of No. 2 Spanish rice were transacted at prices of 75.30 yuan and 78.80 yuan, respectively. It is reported that the imported rice was transacted by Jardine Matheson & Co. and will be loaded onto ships and transported to Shanghai soon to supply the market. As for the No. 2 tribute rice that was previously telegraphed for transaction, it may arrive at the port this weekend.

### New French Consul General Unwilling to Come to Shanghai

After the French Consul General in Shanghai, Orlandini, resigned, the new Consul General appointed to succeed him was Maguet, who was reported to have departed from the United States for Shanghai. It is now heard that Maguet, due to unfamiliarity with the situation in Shanghai, is unwilling to come here to take up his new post. His telegram of resignation stated, "Unfamiliar with the situation in the Orient, and even more clueless about the international city of Shanghai, I am unable to perform my duties. Considering my lack of knowledge, I would rather resign to make way for a more capable person."

### New US Consul General to Shanghai to Arrive Next Week to Take Office, Acting Consul General Peck to Return to US Soon, American University Club Schedules Farewell Event

The new U.S. Consul General to Shanghai, Lockhart, was formally appointed to the position after Consul General Gauss was promoted to Minister to Australia. Mr. Lockhart was on vacation, so he left Shanghai with his family in July to return to the United States for vacation. According to a reporter from the Sin Wan Pao, Lockhart has now arrived in Shanghai from San Francisco on the President Coolidge. Mr. Lockhart's wife, however, was prevented from coming to Shanghai due to a State Department order for

His first decision to come to Shanghai was in 1919. In 1925, he represented the United States in the revision of Chinese customs tariffs. Lockhart is now 59 years old, born in Texas, USA in 1881.

### Polish Merchant Talks About German Confiscation of Private Property

Recently, a Polish merchant arrived here from Lodz, Poland, and spoke about an order recently issued by Greiser, the administrative head of Warsaw, stating that all private property confiscated in the area would be managed by German officials. This Greiser had served as the mayor of the Free City of Danzig. After Poland was occupied by Germany, he was assigned to be the head of Warsaw, and his first "order" concerned the confiscation of private property of Poles and Jews in the area. In Lodz, Poland's second largest city, the German head has also officially established an organization to manage Aryan property. According to the merchant, all civilian property currently confiscated by the German government is controlled by the German General Administration in the eastern provinces, which is composed entirely of German committee members.

### Japanese Ship Damages Pontoon Dock, Great Disturbance on the Bund, Part of the Bow Embedded in the Dock, Reason for the Accident by Shunfeng Maru Inexplicable

According to the *Shanghai Times*, around 4:30 PM yesterday (the 13th), a great disturbance arose near the Beijing Road dock on the Bund. The cause was that the Shunfeng Maru, an inland river ship of the Japanese-owned Huadong Shipping Company, suddenly crashed straight into the 14th pontoon dock while sailing there. Part of the bow of the ship was embedded in the dock. It is heard that the ship suffered significant damage, but the pontoon dock has been damaged and will require two weeks of repairs before it can be used to moor ships. The Water Police stated yesterday that the reason for the accident by the Shunfeng Maru is inexplicable, as the ship was heading to the third pontoon dock downstream on the Bund to moor.

### Several Mercerizing and Dyeing Factories Have Resumed Work

The strike by silk mercerizing and dyeing factories in Shanghai was resolved by the French Concession Political Affairs Department, which convened representatives of labor and management at the Machine Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association the other day. Nine preliminary conditions were signed on the spot, and the labor representatives agreed that all workers would first resume work the next day (the 11th). The remaining unresolved items were also decided to be negotiated again after resuming work. However, some short-term workers believed that the working period had not been agreed upon and expressed strong dissatisfaction. They went out and strongly prevented the resumption of work. After direct talks between labor and management, it was agreed that if any further attempts were made to prevent the resumption of work, the factories could request the police authorities to send police to protect them. Therefore, several factories have resumed work within the day. Continued negotiations will be held on the 17th of this month.

### British-Owned Public Bus Company Orders New Buses, No Further Motion to Increase Fares

The British-owned China General Omnibus Company in Shanghai has recently ordered new double-decker buses from the United Kingdom due to the development of its business. Several buses have been loaded onto ships and transported to Shanghai, joining the operations on routes 1, 4, and 14. The appearance of these new buses is generally similar to the existing ones, but the rear windows are square. The mechanical structure is also very sophisticated. As for the recent rumors in Shanghai that public bus fares will be increased, a reporter from the Datong News Agency learned from relevant sources that the company is not currently preparing to increase fares. Moreover, the price increase of passenger tickets must be reviewed and approved by the Municipal Council, and the Council has not heard of such a proposal.

### Chairman of Jingyong Nail Factory Illegally Dismisses Manager, Court Rules Board Resolution Invalid, Zhang Shixin Continues to Perform Duties

Zhang Shixin, a Wuxi native, founded the Jingyong Machinery Nail Manufacturing Joint Stock Company on Longfu Lane, North Zhejiang Road, several years ago. He raised a total of 20,000 yuan in capital. Zhang is a major shareholder, having paid up 5,500 yuan of capital, accounting for one-fourth of the total capital. Therefore, the board of directors organized by the shareholders elected Zhang as the company's manager and elected shareholder Zhu Ruilin as the company's chairman. After Zhang took office as manager, he

Strove for Development

Of the company's business, with annual surpluses. However, Chairman Zhu Ruilin and Director Xi Xisheng and others disagreed with Zhang. On April 23 of this year, Zhang was imprisoned by the police. On April 25, Zhu Ruilin and others, in the name of a joint meeting of directors and supervisors, dismissed Zhang from his position as manager and resolved that Zhu Ruilin should serve as manager and Xi Xisheng should serve as assistant manager. Xi Xisheng also took away the company's account books. After Zhang was cleared by the police and allowed to regain his freedom, he felt extremely angry because his managerial powers had been

Illegally Deprived. He recently commissioned lawyers Dan Yuhua and Zhang Bingjun to file a complaint with the Civil Division of the First Special Court, requesting confirmation that all resolutions of the meeting of directors and supervisors convened by the defendants Zhu Ruilin et al. on April 25 of this year were invalid, and requesting an order for the defendants Xi Xisheng et al. to hand over the account books and for the plaintiff to continue to perform his managerial duties. They also listed as many as eight violations by the defendants Zhu Ruilin et al. After the court received the complaint, Judge Mo

Concluded the Trial

Ruling that the eight claims made by Zhang Shixin were not without reason. Therefore, the court announced its judgment the other day. The main text stated: "The resolutions passed by the defendants on April 25 of this year are invalid. The defendants should hand over the account books to the plaintiff, who will continue to perform his managerial duties. The litigation costs will be borne by the defendants."

### Failed Speculation, Sued for Debt, Subject of the Suit Over 20,000 Yuan, Defendant Claims Illness and Fails to Appear

A merchant named Chen Xisheng believed that speculation was profitable in recent years. On May 6 of this year, he deposited 2,500 yuan in cash with Runheng Company at the Securities Building and entrusted the company's broker, Ding Zhiming, to buy and sell stocks on his behalf. These were not spot transactions, but were calculated based on the difference between the buying and selling prices. On May 13 of this year, Ding Zhiming bought more than a thousand shares of various Huai stocks on Chen's behalf. By May 24, Ding had sold all of the stocks because Chen had not expressed any opinion. As a result, Chen lost 26,352 yuan. Ding then repeatedly requested Chen to pay this amount orally and in writing, but Chen ignored him. Recently, Ding hired lawyer E Sen to file a complaint with the Civil Division of the First Special Court, requesting an order for the defendant Chen Xisheng to repay 26,352.25 yuan in national currency. After the court received the complaint, Judge Mo opened a civil hearing yesterday to summon the defendant Chen Xisheng in person, but Chen

Claimed Illness and Failed to Appear, and commissioned lawyer Tao Wuzhi to appear on his behalf. The plaintiff Ding Zhiming's lawyer, E Sen, often stated to the court that the defendant Chen Xisheng was feigning illness and not appearing. In fact, the defendant had come to the plaintiff's office yesterday to discuss a settlement, but the conditions were not agreed upon, and the discussions broke down. After verifying the statements, the court ordered that the case be rescheduled for trial on the 29th of this month. It is hoped that the two parties, Chen and Ding, can reach a settlement out of court during the rescheduling period. If a settlement is not reached, the defendant will be required to appear in court in person for the next hearing.

### Japanese Military Truck Speeds, Crushes Pedestrian to Death

Around 2:00 PM yesterday, several Japanese military trucks were traveling through the area near the Qiujiang Wharf on Qiujiang Road. A middle-aged man, approximately forty years old, who looked like a merchant, wearing a long Ishilin cloth gown, Western-style trousers, and leather shoes, was crossing the road when he was suddenly knocked down by a speeding truck. His head was crushed and his brains spilled out, resulting in his immediate death. The scene was horrific.

### Japanese Military Vehicle Attacked by Gunfire, Driver Shot and Wounded, Officer Unharmed, Temporary Special Martial Law in North of Suzhou Creek

At 6:30 PM yesterday, Hirano Taoo, a Japanese Navy Lieutenant Commander, who is currently a medical officer in the Naval Landing Force, was traveling in a military vehicle with Naval Lieutenant Commander Yakisai on business when someone suddenly pulled out a handgun at the intersection of Bazhi Road and North Sichuan Road and fired

Seven or Eight Shots at the Japanese Officers in the Vehicle. Because the vehicle was moving very fast, neither of the two officers in the vehicle were hit. However, the driver of the vehicle was shot and seriously wounded. The gunman fled without a trace after the incident. When nearby Chinese police officers arrived after hearing the shots, they saw the Japanese military vehicle parked on the side of the road and the gunman had already fled. They immediately sent the injured driver to Huimin Hospital for treatment. After the incident, the Japanese side suddenly declared

Temporary Martial Law in Hongkou. All bridges connecting to the south of Suzhou Creek were blocked by Japanese troops. Except for Japanese people, all pedestrians and vehicles were prohibited from passing. Two red security vehicles and many Chinese and Western detectives were stationed at the southern end of the Waibaidu Bridge, strictly searching pedestrians. The situation was quite serious. Many residents living north of Suzhou Creek were stopped and stranded at the ends of the bridges while returning home, numbering several hundred.

### A Bachelor Father and Unmarried Mother: Mother and Child Sue for Support; Deceased Husband's Father Refuses Acknowledgment; Mediation for Living Expenses Fails

Xu Caiyun, also known as Meimei, a woman from Pudong, is 22 years old this year. Recently, acting as the legal representative of her young child, Xu Ziwen, she filed a petition with the Civil Mediation Office of the Second Special Court against Xu Yuansheng (resident of No. 14, Gengyu Lane, Bubai Road), requesting payment of 50,000 yuan in support. The petition states, in essence, that in the spring of the 28th year [of the Republic], Ms. Xu met Xiang Han, the son of the defendant, and they fell in love. Xiang Han repeatedly said he had no wife and was willing to marry. Ms. Xu, seeing Xiang Han's sincerity, pledged herself to him. Thus, their love blossomed, although their virtue was compromised. Initially, they met secretly in hotels, then rented a house and lived together. After a sweet honeymoon, she became pregnant. When the time came, Xiang Han, using the name Zhu Desheng, sent her to the Kemei Hospital on Avenue Joffre, where she gave birth to a son. Xiang Han named him Ziwen and doted on him. Unexpectedly, misfortune struck, and Xiang Han suddenly fell seriously ill and died at his old home despite doctors' efforts. Upon hearing the news, Ms. Xu was overcome with grief. Thinking of Xiang Han's misfortune, she found solace in Ziwen. She endured the pain and struggled to raise her infant. Considering that the defendant was a direct blood relative of her and her child, and should bear the responsibility of support, she took Ziwen to request adoption, hoping to avoid destitution and provide for their care. However, on the day they arrived, the defendant refused to see them, leaving Ms. Xu lost and helpless. Forced to hire a lawyer to send a letter, she was also ignored. In this time of high prices, Ms. Xu, a weak woman, has no means to support herself. Bereaved and adrift, her daily life is unsustainable, and she is in a precarious situation. Therefore, she filed this petition, requesting the court to order the defendant to pay 50,000 yuan in support to save their lives. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Shen Youqi convened both parties to the court in the Fourth Civil Division for mediation based on the petition. Only the petitioner appeared in court; the defendant did not appear despite being summoned. The court concluded that the mediation was unsuccessful.

### Social Miscellany

Since the war, more than 100 thatched sheds have been built near the Lukia Road intersection in the Fahua Township, Shanghai West, where taverns and teahouses operate.

### Kidnapping of an Elementary School Student; Car Accident Leads to Rescue; All Three Kidnappers Apprehended Afterward; Driver Detained for Investigation Due to Strong Suspicion

Yesterday afternoon around 1:00 PM, an attempted kidnapping occurred in front of the American School on Avenue Petain in the French Concession. The victim was a young student named Xi Deji. The details are as follows:

Returning Late as Usual

Xi Juxing, a comprador at the Shangying Youli Bank from Suzhou, lives in a Western-style house at No. 1131 Avenue Joffre. His son, Deji, is ten years old and studies at the American Elementary School on Avenue Petain. He goes to school early and returns late, and is usually picked up and dropped off by his own car, No. 11590, driven by Zhang Amao, a local driver. Yesterday afternoon around 1:00 PM, Zhang Amao drove the car to the school to pick up the young master for lunch.

Car Accident

Three kidnappers ambushed the car on the roadside, blocking its path. They pulled out guns, shouting loudly. As a result, they kidnapped both the person and the car. When the car reached Route Heig and Route Hongqiao, a cyclist happened to be coming in front, and the car was unable to swerve in time, knocking the cyclist to the ground. Nearby police officers arrived after hearing the news and questioned them. The three kidnappers in the car knew things were going badly, so they abandoned their guns and got out of the car one after another, fleeing towards the Chinese area.

Rescuing the Hostage

At that time, the young hostage in the car reported the kidnapping to the police. After listening, the police immediately gave chase and blew their whistles wildly. Police officers gathered to assist in the encirclement and arrest. As a result, all three kidnappers were captured and taken to the police station for investigation. Meanwhile, the police drove the hostage Xi Deji and the driver Zhang Amao, along with the car, to the Avenue Petain police station, informing the family and sending someone to take them back. The police now believe that the driver Zhang Amao is highly suspicious and has been detained. Detectives have been sent to search his residence.

### Autumn Wind Rises

— Lei Xing

Sir, the season has changed! What are your thoughts?

Would you like to take a look around the streets? Come! Let me point them out to you: there's a pear stall, this side sells sesame candy, and there are passersby coming and going; but, you always see people in tattered clothes, right?

Isn't it strange? There are so many vagrants on just one street: children, old men, women; with rotten legs, blind eyes; sir, what are your thoughts?

When you go out at night, you won't forget to bring a coat for your wife, right? It's getting cold!

Towards our suffering compatriots, we shouldn't be stingy with that bit of concern, right? They share our misfortunes, shall we cruelly clench our own little happiness, and let them freeze to death in the future north wind?

Moreover, in such times, who can guarantee there will still be a warm home tomorrow? Sir, extend your sympathetic hand, and save the suffering people!

Look, even the autumn wind is so tight! Winter is far and long.

Family

### I Hate My Family

— Ruihua

Friends all say that I am a happy person because I grew up in a wealthy family and live a stable life. However, how can they understand my heart! A surge of anger is rising: silent anger, resentment, revulsion towards everything in the family.

My father is a very easygoing person who lives a leisurely life relying on the property of his ancestors. But his deformed hobby keeps him busy all day long, and he rarely stays at home for a whole day. My mother passed away when I was nine years old, leaving only me behind. I don't know much about the origin of my stepmother, but I only heard that she came from a "business wave" because many people say so.

At first, my stepmother had a very good temper and treated me quite kindly, often taking care of me personally, sometimes even making me forget that there was a dead mother in the underworld. Everyone said this was my good fortune, and I myself thought it was not bad.

However, in less than a year, I finally tasted the stepmother's fist. She revealed her true colors and became very terrible. Not only were her snobbish eyes particularly fierce, but her mouth was also very venomous. In her mind, everyone seemed to have a long, strange, and nice-sounding criticism, scaring relatives from visiting, but she didn't realize it and instead blamed them for being too indifferent.

A year later, she brought in a seven-year-old girl, who became my sister. It was said that she was her relative, but others said she was her biological daughter. Only my stepmother knew this in her heart.

From then on, there was another quarrelsome member in the family. The two of them, working together, could cause a storm over trivial matters, going east to find fault and west to scold, making the family uneasy. My father never said a word. As a result, she became bolder and more shrewish, scolding everyone in the family, and even the servants couldn't stay long. Finally, my grandmother couldn't stand her domineering power and left to live separately with my aunt. Then, my uncles and aunts also moved away. Suddenly, a lively big family became cold and desolate. I also felt bored, so I simply lived in school and rarely went home. Even during vacations, I would stay with my grandmother. Therefore, during those years, I seemed very distant from my stepmother, sister, and father.

The war changed my life again. The headmaster didn't provide accommodation, so I had to return home. At first, I hoped that my stepmother would be gentler and that my sister would be older and no longer find fault. Who knew that the result didn't give me that impression. My father was still out all day, even returning at dawn. My stepmother, in addition to going out often, played mahjong with friends at home all day long, still so snobbish, liking to talk about others, finding fault with people, and scolding. She was still the same as before, and I was disappointed. Although my sister was also studying, her temper was as muddled as my stepmother's. Sometimes, when there were three people missing for a mahjong game, she would throw away her textbooks and sit down to make up the numbers. I was disappointed in her too.

For three years, the whole family was still shrouded in smog and decay. I was always alone at home because I was not as muddled as them. Anger and resentment blazed in my heart. I could only bury myself in hard work, preparing for the day when I could be independent, fly far away, and leave this corrupt family forever.

Hawthorne's Cases

### The Ballerina's Ending

— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter Nine: Shocking News

Ni Jinshou continued, "Mr. Hawthorne, there's more. According to Qin Mozhai, the result of Dr. Bai's autopsy is that Wang Lilan died from a stab wound to the heart from a blade, not from a gunshot. Mr. Hawthorne, do you think this is a problem? Hasn't our half-day's work been a waste?"

Upon hearing this, Hawthorne's nerves seemed to undergo a drastic change. He put the receiver down on the telephone and stopped speaking. He remained silent by the phone for two or three seconds, then raised his left hand to look at his watch. Then, a wry smile appeared on his face.

"Baolang, you really have foresight! I can't help but admire you! -- It's already two-thirty."

I felt his words were simply incoherent. Could it be that the stimulus of this news was too drastic, and his iron-willed nerves couldn't withstand it, causing him to lose his composure? Before I could find words of comfort, he suddenly spoke a few more coherent sentences.

"Baolang, I'm going to the police station right away to see the commissioner. You don't need to come with me." He looked at my face and said with a smile, "Don't worry, I won't have a falling out with him. Although I have a gun in my pocket, I won't use it recklessly. You still don't understand me, my nerves are as sound as yours—maybe even more so. The reason I don't want you to come along is that I need you to take on other tasks."

I asked, "Then, what do you want me to do?"

Hawthorne said, "In half an hour, go to Wang Lilan's house and measure Old Mao's shoes first."

I replied, "Okay, that's easy. What else?"

"Secondly, invite that old man Li Zhiban and ask him to keep you company in the downstairs parlor—remember, you must talk to him inside the parlor. There are two more conditions: close the door to the parlor and pull down the yellow curtains on the steel window."

### Rising Tides and Price Limits

### Go Learn from Others

— Ren An

The meaning of education is to confirm the path of effort based on experience, and its purpose is to reduce errors and failures. In this regard, history is a mirror for reality, and the biographical articles of so-called successful people tell us the path of effort.

But if we study it from the saying "drawing a tiger and failing to resemble it," then this act of "learning from others" is not a simple matter!

At present, some people think that success or failure has a natural iron law. The manager thinks that it is a matter of course to go from being an apprentice to the current high position, and wants his apprentice to imitate him one by one; the father takes his own transformation from a coppersmith to a wealthy man as a wealth of experience, and wants his college graduate son to stand by the furnace. This is not only that these overly individualistic gentlemen are too stupid, but they are also likely to make young people misunderstand that learning plus effort equals the natural law of success. The current and past realities are different, so how can we come and decide to turn over the old book?

However, I am by no means denying the efforts of the predecessors. But, when we learn from others, we should indeed learn their spirit of effort, but we should also recognize the actual environment in which they are and our own actual environment. In this regard, when we go to learn from others, we should first clearly recognize others.

At the same time, we must understand that the reason why I want to learn from others is not in the pursuit of voices and smiles. There are many gentlemen who think they are smart and go to learn the small actions of other people's homes step by step, like puppets holding tablets on stage, like actors in operas, dressed in formal clothes, looking like emperors. We must know that the success of Tian Xuwo Sheng (Mr. Chen Diexian) is not in voices and smiles. Zhang San and Li Siaosheng have the same face as Mr. Wu Yun Chu, and without effort and struggle, they will not become MSG inventors. Yu Dafu's success is definitely not in romance and drinking. If you only go whoring and drinking, you will only succeed as a prodigal, so how can you be worthy of being called a writer!

Accordingly, when we go to learn from others, we should learn actual effort!

However, there is no perfect person in the world, and we do not necessarily have to accept and learn from the past of others in its entirety. The so-called it is better to have no book than to completely trust the book. The most economical way is to grasp the point that can be learned. In the study of writing and painting, people are generally proud of imitating the style of a certain teacher, but the most successful people are those who integrate various schools, or form their own style. Zheng Banqiao also deliberately imitated at first, but later realized the four words "each person has a body" before he became famous.

Therefore, taking the law from above, and obtaining the middle, this is learning from one school, taking the strengths of each school, and developing each part together. This is not only better than the blue, but also a superior "learning from others" method that can eat and digest.

### Crisis of Life (I)

Jesus once taught people, "Do not store up treasures for yourselves on earth, where moths and vermin destroy, and where thieves break in and steal. But store up treasures for yourselves in heaven, where moths and vermin do not destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also." (Matthew 6:19-21)

If we want to understand this passage of the Bible, we must first know that the two words "treasure" used here are "jewels" in the original Greek. Although money is a treasure, treasures should not be limited to money. Jesus said, "Where your treasure is, there your heart will be also," which shows that Jesus is focused on the human heart, not treasures. We often see that as people's external possessions increase, their inner hearts shrink instead. First, treasures are for people to use, and later people are reduced to slaves of treasures, driven by treasures. The so-called crisis of people is here. Because people's hearts are easily eroded, easily fallen, and easily stolen, now let's talk about these three points separately:

(1) Worm-eaten: The so-called worm-eaten refers to infection. No matter what something is, as long as a worm invades, it will soon multiply into thousands upon thousands, until the thing is hollowed out. The worm that harms personality is sin. At first, it is extremely small. Later, it grows from small to large, from light to heavy, from shallow to deep, endlessly, which can completely eat up a person's personality. Over time, it leads people to the path of destruction. Therefore, we must guard against our hearts from becoming infected, and not let this kind of personality worm invade, causing the danger of being worm-eaten. There are many sins in the world, most of which are for treasures. All theft, embezzlement, plundering, exploitation, robbery, and extortion are due to the treasures. If the rich use their wealth properly for their own sake, and the poor can also use their personality not to covet or covet what belongs to others, then the sins in society can be eliminated a lot.

### Historical Dramas of the Ming Dynasty

Recently, there are two historical dramas about the Ming Dynasty being performed: one is "Heroes of the Sea Kingdom" by the New Art Drama Society, written by Wei Ruhui; and the other is "The Great Ming Heroes" by the Shanghai Drama Art Society, written by Yu Ling. These two historical dramas each have their own merits.

Wei's work is based on historical facts everywhere, referring to 300 kinds of books. The description is a small booklet, in which the textual research on the characters is very detailed. The bibliography can be seen from the bibliography, which is the characteristic of Ruhui with the textual research habit: Yu's work is mostly not based on historical facts. Except for Liu Bowen and Chang Yuchun, who are historical figures, most of the others, including the heroine Su Jiaojiao, are not historically extant, but they are not completely imagined. Although there is no historical basis, there is a basis in fact. If we look carefully, we can imagine one or two of them. In short, there are such moving things in the world.

But these two historical dramas have made great efforts in terms of structure. Wei's work can be called "The Post-Modern Ge Nenniang," so in the second act, Zheng Hongda mentioned, "When the former Ge Nenniang came, I had a big fight with him." In the fourth act, Ma Yuzi came on stage, and there was another "damn it," which can arouse the audience's interest. The third act also mentions Zhang Huangyan's letter, so it is prepared to lead to the fourth part of the Southern Ming historical drama "Lonely Ape on a Hanging Island." According to the old novel, these are said to be "correspondence" and "foreshadowing." For example, the third act uses two "exchanges" to replace the two days and nights of war: in the fourth act, when Cang'er sees Zheng Jing, he recalls the past, all of which are excellent structures. Yu Ling's works have always been developed in many aspects, and there is not much compact structure, such as "Flowers Splashed with Tears," "Women's Apartment," "Women's Country," "Night Shanghai," etc. This time, it is an exception to have a complete structure. The last act is similar to the Soviet film "Female Warrior."

At the same time, these two scripts both end with victory and optimism, and both try their best to avoid defeatism. Yu's work is based on the early Ming Dynasty, with historical evidence, so it is naturally victorious; Wei's work writes to Zheng Chenggong's revitalization of the righteous army and plans to launch another northern expedition, just like Ouyang's "Liang Hongyu," and in the end, it still gives us great excitement.

After we have seen these two scripts, we should be able to get a lot of undertones from here, right?

### Tong Zhiling, About to Return North

— Mengyu

Tong Zhiling, who performed in the Golden Theater, is a proud disciple of Hui Sheng and is quite famous in Ping. This is her first time in Shanghai. Because of her beautiful appearance and superb acting skills, she is very popular with the audience and has become a famous actress in the north and south. According to Zhiling, she is originally from Nanchang and was born in Peiping. Her father once served as the principal of the Tianjin Jiangxi School; she has two elder brothers, both of whom are students of Jiang Miaoxiang and are as famous as Zhiling. Zhiling received secondary education, is beautiful and dignified, and has no actress habits. She loved Peking opera since she was a child, and could perform on stage at the age of eleven or twelve. After apprenticing to Hui Sheng, she received the deepest guidance, and she can perform Hui Sheng's plays with his charm, vividly. Her talent is very thick, and her voice is high and bright. She can also perform plays from the Mei and Cheng schools, which is really rare. However, this time in the south, because Li Shengzao often performs the original plays, Zhiling's plays were scheduled earlier, and the audience who arrived late often did not have time to see the whole picture, which inevitably disappointed the beautiful art, and Zhiling was also regretful about it. Now that the term has expired, she is about to return north. Below is a recent photo of her.

Book Circle Biographies

### Shen Jian'an and Xu Jixiang

— Ye Jiale

The Soviet Union's Hailanpao and Heilongjiang's Aigun are far apart: seeing the ballad singer Shen Jian'an and the storytelling master Xu Jixiang can also be said to be far apart, one is the dumb school's Pearl Pagoda, which is popular in the book circle, and the other is the dumb school's heroic martyrs, which was once very popular. Now I will describe them separately as follows:

"Pearl Pagoda" is the king of small books, which no one can deny, because this book is the most bookish. When it comes to the talents who tell the Pearl Pagoda, they are really endless. But there are very few who can tell it vividly, except for Wei Yuqing, only Shen Jian'an. The old-fashionedness of his speech, the delicacy of his book path, and the dumb but waxy voice are of course his excellent conditions. His good partner Xue Xiaoqing is famous for his exquisite pipa, so when singing and playing, the dumb voice and the pipa are blended together, which makes it even more flavorful. His signature actions, such as Fang Qing seeing the girl, beating the three unfilial, and crying about Chen Cui'e, have long been known.

"Vomiting Blood Four Officials" is Xu Jixiang's nickname. This of course shows that he is physically weak. When it comes to his book art, it is not worth mentioning, his voice is dumb but not sandy, his book path is pure and clear, without any clutter; he does not pay much attention to the role, except for the old brand Hu Dahai, most of the others are perfunctory. Coming up with jokes is his specialty, which is second to none in the storytelling circle. Often when he talks about the highlights, witty remarks are born, lining his funny face, of course, he wins the laughter of the whole hall, so I dare to say boldly that eight or nine tenths of his popularity is obtained from the jokes.

In short, Shen Jian'an and Xu Jixiang are both popular files today, and I don't need to praise them anymore. I hope they will maintain their current position well.

### Record of the First Performance by Drama School Students

— Prepared by Cheng

The Shanghai Drama School, modeled after the Fu Liancheng Binqingshe and other institutions in Beiping, has invited Guan Hongbin, Ruidebao, and others to teach with utmost care. Although it has only been ten months, the results are already remarkable. To enhance the students' stage experience, more than 40,000 yuan was specially made for costumes and props. Starting from the 12th of this month, they will perform at the Golden Grand Theater for four days. The opening play on the first day, *Quan Guan Ci Fu* (The Official's Grant of Blessings), involved more than one hundred people. The dazzling spectacle was a group play rarely seen on the Shanghai stage in recent years. The complete *Jiulong Bei* (Nine Dragon Cups) and the complete *Si Pan Shan* (Four Plateaus Mountain). In the first, Wang Zhengkun played Huang Santai, while Jing Zhengfei and Liu Zhengkui played Yang Xiangwu and Zhou Yinglong respectively. During the fight scenes, banners fluttered and swords flashed, making for a truly impressive sight. In the second, Guan Zhengming played Si Lang (the Fourth Son), while Gu Zhengqiu and Zhou Zhengwen played the Princess and the Empress Dowager. There were as many as forty Tartars. On the second day, during the matinee performance of *Fugui Changchun* (Wealth and Longevity), the "Pile of Flowers" scene was filled with singing and dancing, creating an exceptionally lively atmosphere. In the complete *Famen Si* (Famen Temple), Zhou Zhengli played Liu Ying, while Sun Zhenglu and Zhang Zhengfang played Yu Jiao and Zhao Lian respectively, both in terms of singing and acting were excellent. In the complete *Tielong Shan* (Iron Dragon Mountain), Wang Zhengkun played Jiang Wei, while Zheng Zhengxue and Liu Zhengyi played Chen Tai before and after, all putting in great effort. The evening performance of *Caiyuan Fusou* (Wealth Gathering) was also a popular opera piece with many auspicious words in the lyrics, performed by over a hundred people, also a large-scale group play; *Jie Jiang Duo Dou* (Intercepting the River to Seize the Dipper) and *Er Jin Gong* (Second Entrance to the Palace), in the first, Yang Zhengshan and Wang Zhengkun played Shangxiang and Zhao Yun, and both were wonderful. In the latter, Xu Zhengjun and Guan Zhengming played Yanzhao and Yang Bo, with equal skill. The closing act, *Ba Wu Hua Dong* (Eight Five Flower Caves), from the starting of the boat to the stopping of the demon, the eight true and false Wu Das, with their curled feet and short steps, were already very funny, and the eight true and false Jin Lians had sweet and tuneful voices, making them very pleasant to listen to. Because the students all strove for excellence, even when playing minor roles, they followed the rules meticulously, without the slightest carelessness. Coupled with the brand-new costumes and the large number of performers, it is no wonder that every performance was sold out.

Tall and strong men, riding white horses, holding double guns, galloping across the vast wilderness, just like sitting quietly in a small movie theater as a child, watching Tom Mix play four movies.

Mr. Zhou has also written another play, *Hua Mulan* (Mulan), during these three months, which is currently in rehearsal. However, *Haiguo Yingxiong* (Heroes of the Sea) will run until the 17th, and *Hua Mulan* may not be ready to go on stage at that time. It has now been decided to use the famous work *Demon of Desire* from the past as a transitional piece for several days, with the leading role of Hua Yueying played by Sun Jinglu.
