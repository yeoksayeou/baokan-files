Chongqing: At a tea party for the Chinese press yesterday, Chen Cheng delivered a lengthy speech, reporting on the progress of the Battle of Yichang and announcing that he had received permission to resign from all rear-area positions in order to focus on his responsibilities in the war zone. Regarding the future war situation, Chen Cheng stressed that the Japanese are still urgently seeking to resolve the China issue, but all means have been exhausted, so there may be a final desperate attempt. On our side, regardless of whether the Japanese come or not, we should be actively prepared. Considering the various conditions, if the Japanese attack, we welcome it. Even if they do not attack, we will counterattack. Finally, regarding the issue of prices, Chen Cheng pointed out that the reasons for the surge are hoarding and difficulties in transportation. Regarding the former, Chen Cheng believes that judging from the international situation, the enemy's situation, and our own conditions, it is not difficult to conclude that the war will be successful within a year. At that time, the goods hoarded by unscrupulous merchants will be impossible to sell. Hoarding is foolish. Moreover, the war of resistance is a revolution. When necessary, we may use revolutionary means to deal with these fools. Regarding the difficulty in transportation, Chen Cheng used rice prices as an example, believing that the fundamental solution is to drastically disperse the personnel of various agencies to enable them to obtain food locally (Havas Telegraph from the 24th).

### Ministry of Finance Designates Bank of China as the Agency for Exchanging British Currency; Orders Holders of British Banknotes to Exchange Them for Legal Tender at Local Branches of the Bank of China

Chongqing: The British government recently promulgated a law restricting the British pound banknotes issued by the Bank of England, requiring them to be sent back to the Bank of England for clearing before August 17th of this year. After August 27th of this year, these British pound banknotes may not be returned to the UK for clearing. The Hong Kong government has implemented this in accordance with the British law. In order to protect the interests of the Chinese people holding these British pound banknotes, the Ministry of Finance has designated the Bank of China's branches as agencies for exchanging British pound banknotes for legal tender, so that they can be collected and transported to the central bank. In addition to ordering the Bank of China to handle the exchange, it is also announced to the public that all citizens holding British pound banknotes issued by the Bank of England must exchange them for legal tender at local branches of the Bank of China before the 26th of this month to avoid losses. The time is pressing, so please do not hesitate and make a mistake (Telegraph from the 24th).

### Chinese Impression of the British Prime Minister's Speech

According to sources close to the government, Churchill said in his speech: "Our purpose is to faithfully and resolutely fulfill all responsibilities and obligations in all parts of the world." The Far East is one of the important parts of the world. Since the British Prime Minister is determined to fulfill Britain's responsibilities and obligations in all parts of the world, Britain will naturally not neglect its responsibilities and obligations to the Far East, especially to China. It is generally believed that under the British Prime Minister's serious statement, the recent Burma Agreement concluded between Britain and Japan will not be renewed after the three-month period expires (Telegraph from the 24th).

Chongqing: A senior Chinese official recently told Reuters that British Prime Minister Churchill's speech in the House of Commons has made a deep impression on the Chinese side here.

This statement has strengthened the hope that Britain will not continue to neglect its obligations and responsibilities to China, and that the Anglo-Japanese agreement on the Burma Road will not be continued after its expiration (Reuters Telegraph from the 24th).

Editorial

### The Test of Bombing Chongqing

A week ago, this newspaper discussed the Japanese side's published statistics on the bombing of Chongqing by the Japanese Air Force in the three months after May 18th, and compared them to the air war between Britain and Germany. Afterwards, we continued to receive telegrams from Chongqing stating that the Japanese army continued to bomb, dropping mostly incendiary bombs, and it was reported that almost four-fifths of the Chongqing urban area was destroyed, and nearly ten thousand citizens lost their homes and had nowhere to go. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, grieving the citizens' tragic suffering, ordered the allocation of one million yuan for emergency relief. Recently, the Chinese government issued a statement saying that in the three months, a total of 64 Japanese aircraft were shot down, and it was estimated that the Japanese side spent as much as 47 million US dollars bombing Chongqing, while Chongqing's losses were worth about 1 million US dollars. The number of people killed was 2,051, and the number of injured was 3,479. According to neutral observers, Chongqing's losses are undoubtedly considerable, but in any case, they are not as great as the Japanese side's waste. It is also rumored that the National Government has moved away from this ruined wartime capital, which the National Government has denied. All these recent reports must be remembered by those who sympathize with China's war of resistance and construction and care about the officials and people of Chongqing. However, this is also a good test, and soon facts will provide a clear answer.

Chongqing was the State of Ba in the Zhou Dynasty and Ba County in the Qin and Han Dynasties. It is a pity that this ancient city with more than 3,000 years of history has been almost completely destroyed due to foreign aggression; and more than 5,000 people have been killed and injured, and the number of homeless people will be doubled. This is the ultimate tragedy for humanity. Moreover, the reason why the war of resistance and national construction is justified is that it has suffered this unexpected disaster hundreds of miles behind the front line due to the comparative backwardness of military preparations. This is especially deeply lamented by those with a sense of justice. What can be tolerated is that on the day the country is at war, the devastation of cities and fields, and the sacrifice of life and property, whether it is 5,000 people or hundreds of thousands of people, whether it is four-fifths of a place or the entire place being razed to the ground, whether it is worth one million or tens of millions, is not unusual. After all, war is fundamentally a tragedy, a destructive act; for those who are sacrificed, those who are devastated, for justice, for independence and freedom, for the country, for future generations, they will of course endure the pain and never yield. Moreover, they are prepared to endure from the beginning of their determination to fight, and they will not regret it at the time of winning victory. Moreover, compared with the occupied areas, Chongqing has suffered damage to the ground, while the occupied areas have suffered damage to the land, air, and underground treasures. More than 5,000 people have been killed and injured in Chongqing, while the number of people killed and injured in the occupied areas is countless. The citizens of Chongqing have lost their possessions, while the people in the occupied areas have almost lost their eyesight, mind, and soul. Chongqing has indeed suffered deep pain, and those who hear about it far and wide will sympathize with it. However, the people in the occupied areas are hoping that Chongqing will be able to relieve their suffering!

After the disaster, is Chongqing only one-fifth of what the Japanese side ideally targeted? The Japanese side bombed Chongqing, saying that it must be completely destroyed. Now that four-fifths have been destroyed, and the most severe destruction has been achieved in recent days, is the complete destruction not far away? The Japanese side said that destroying Chongqing is to destroy the political power of the National Government, and it is to destroy the policy of war of resistance and national construction; then in the near future, if Chongqing is completely razed to the ground, will Japan's great desire to conquer China and its attempt to quickly end the so-called China Incident not be fulfilled? The Japanese side said this so loudly that it ignored the world's condemnation of the bombing of Chongqing, saying that it must move forward in this way to achieve its established national policy. Those who argue against it, those who know it criticize it, but the Japanese side not only retorts, but also boasts about the great results of the bombing. Now, Chongqing is on the verge of complete destruction. Empty words are boring, and soon we will be able to get evidence from the facts. Who wants to predict the facts to come? However, is the bombing of Chongqing completely devoid of military value, and is it only a violation of humanity, only a manifestation of barbarism, only a manifestation of cruelty and ruthlessness, so that even if Chongqing is destroyed, it will not change the overall situation of the Sino-Japanese War? Can it really achieve the effect of destroying materials and frustrating the spirit, so that the National Government will give up the war of resistance and destroy it? This test, with the facts to come, is placed before the Japanese and open to the people of the world. What is the answer?

### The US Reaffirms a Severe Attitude Toward Aggressor Nations; Opposes Japan's Current East Asia Policy; All Outstanding Issues Will Eventually Be Settled

Washington: According to news here last night, the US government submitted a strong note to Tokyo two weeks ago. This note was a warning to the Japanese government, opposing Japan's current policy in East Asia. The State Department currently refuses to comment on this news, but Japanese Ambassador to the US Kensuke Horiuchi, who has been summoned back to his country, shows that the Japanese government has recently received a note from the US government. The note was the US response to Japan's protest against the ban on the export of US oil and scrap iron to Japan. US officials refused to confirm or deny the news that Secretary of State Hull's memorandum to Horiuchi detailed the outstanding issues between the US and Japan. It is learned that the memorandum included special criticisms regarding the situation of American expatriates in China and the American commercial situation in China. In addition to reviewing the unresolved cases between Tokyo and Washington, the memorandum also warned Japan that the US has not forgotten the various cases, and the day of reckoning will come. Observers recalled that Horiuchi had a meeting with US Acting Secretary of State Welles on August 9, and informed sources claimed that Welles may have explained Hull's attitude to Horiuchi at that time. Earlier, Japan strongly protested President Roosevelt's announcement banning the export of aircraft gasoline and scrap iron to foreign countries, including Japan. It is widely believed that the US may have used the note responding to Japan's protest to reaffirm the US's severe attitude toward aggressor nations. The content of Japan's protest to the US and the US's reply have not been released here. Welles stated yesterday that in order to preserve diplomatic courtesy, whether or not to release the above protest and reply must follow the Japanese government's opinion.

Horiuchi Stays in Washington Temporarily, Refuses to Talk About US-Japan Relations: Horiuchi notified Hull yesterday that he had been summoned back to his country. He did not yet know the surname of his successor. He will stay in Washington until the new ambassador arrives. After visiting Hull, Horiuchi refused to discuss Japan-US relations. He said that he did not hand over any Japanese note to Hull in person (Associated Press Telegraph from the 24th).

Washington: US Secretary of State Hull returned to Washington yesterday to attend a cabinet meeting. His three-week vacation was obviously not over. Hull told reporters yesterday that he could not mention anything regarding current affairs because he had been in contact with Kume (Haitong News Agency Telegraph from the 24th).

Tokyo: Regarding the Japanese Foreign Minister's recall of 40 overseas representatives, the Asahi Shimbun stated, "This step is to eliminate pro-US elements. The recalled personnel may be completely excluded from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. According to the Foreign Minister's plan, all departments of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs will be changed" (TASS News Agency Telegraph from the 24th).

Washington: The Department of Commerce released a report from a certain Japanese newspaper, saying that a certain Japanese person who recently returned from Rio de Janeiro after consulting with local Japanese diplomats claimed that he could not feel optimistic about Japan and Latin America increasing commerce. The Department of Commerce here, according to Japanese newspaper news, Japanese officials even proposed restricting trade between Japan and Latin America, because most of the raw materials needed by the Americas are chemicals and factory equipment, which Japan cannot easily supply. However, the Department of Commerce also stated that as a result of the talks in Brazil, Japan is carefully studying the establishment of a permanent government trade agency with Latin America (Associated Press Telegraph from the 24th).

### US Conscription Bill: Senate Reopens Debate; Roosevelt Urges Swift Passage; National Guard Mobilization Planned

Washington - Following the passage of the National Guard Mobilization Act, the US Senate yesterday reopened debate on the Burke-Wadsworth Conscription Bill. Wisconsin Republican Senator Wiley declared that even if the conscription bill passes, the United States will not necessarily be drawn into war. The decision on war depends, firstly, on Hitler's actions; secondly, on the attitude of the American public; and thirdly, on the decisions of American political leaders. "We deeply understand that once Britain falls, the flames of war may spread to the Americas, at which time we may have to go out and put out the fire." (United Press International dispatch, 24th)

Washington - President Roosevelt yesterday urged the swift passage of the Burke-Wadsworth Conscription Bill, which is currently being debated in Congress, as it is essential for national defense. The President told the press that national defense must begin within two weeks. Many defense deployments will be completed in the autumn. These deployments are useless if no one uses them. Yesterday, the Senate passed a bill authorizing the President to mobilize 360,000 National Guard and Reserve troops for one year of intensive military training and sent it to the White House. The President, based on this bill, can dispatch defense forces and reserve troops to any place in the Western Hemisphere or to American territories such as the Philippines. The President will sign the bill today, and once signed, it will become law. President Roosevelt told the press that based on the current number of volunteers, 400,000 people can be mobilized in one year. These 400,000 people are necessary to strengthen the regular army and the National Guard. However, in another year, another 400,000 people should be mobilized to meet the need to build an appropriate defense organization. If this huge and organized army is not established by the spring, the entire national defense program cannot proceed according to schedule. There are many military supplies and equipment that can be used by conscripted soldiers. In addition to training in the use of rifles, these conscripted soldiers must also receive training in the use of various other equipment. The President specifically mentioned the need for people to use portable wireless radios and explained the necessity of cooperation between air and ground forces. However, training in this cooperation is still in its preliminary stages in the army. If the military needs 100 people with this skill, but there are only 10 people who have been trained, it is still useless, because the army must be tightly organized and strong. (United Press International dispatch, 24th)

Washington - Senator Barkley, the majority leader, convened a meeting after the Senate failed to approve various amendments to the conscription bill. It is also rumored that President Roosevelt, now that the National Guard bill has been passed, is planning to mobilize 55,000 people on September 15, 55,000 people on October 15, 65,000 people on November 15, and 40,000 people in December for military service. (United Press International dispatch, 24th)

### Japan Admits China Is Not Conquered; Long-Term War Against China Still a Failure

New York - The New York Times editorial today stated that Japan's recent political eruption contains a clear admission that the long-term war against China has, to this day, been a failure.

(Reuters dispatch, 24th)

### Japan and Germany Ready to Invade Brazil; Panama Strictly Guarding Against Fifth Column Activities

Middlesex - Military expert and author Pratt stated yesterday at an authors' conference that thousands of Japanese reservists and German fifth column members are active in Brazil, preparing the groundwork for a German invasion of Brazil should Britain be defeated. (United Press International dispatch, 14th)

Panama - The government of the Republic of Panama today began investigating the existence of fifth column activities within its borders, due to reports that a large number of foreigners, especially Germans, have infiltrated Panama in the past two months. Many foreigners enter the country with temporary passports and then hire lawyers to obtain permanent residency permits. It is hard to guarantee that these people do not aim to destroy the Panama Canal, the lifeline of US national defense. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)

### US to Conduct Alien Registration; Begins on the 27th

Washington - California postal officials have quickly learned fingerprinting techniques and will begin registering 3.6 million aliens in the United States. This task is being carried out under the Smith Act passed by Congress and will begin on August 27 and must be completed within four months. Postal officials have all received instructions on how to handle this matter. The first step is to consult with nearby police and those familiar with fingerprinting.

Panama - Four old-style American destroyers suddenly sailed from the Panama region to the east coast of the United States. Observers here point to this as a sign that the United States is preparing to sell these old ships to Britain. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)

New York - The Chicago Daily News today openly advocated selling outdated American destroyers to Britain, saying that President Roosevelt, Republican presidential candidate Willkie, and domestic public opinion all support this move, and it is regrettable that some are contesting it legally. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)

Washington - President Roosevelt and his cabinet members held a two-hour meeting last night. It is believed that they discussed the issue of the United States leasing 50 destroyers to Britain and leasing British territories in the Western Hemisphere for naval and air bases. However, cabinet members all refused to explain what was discussed at the meeting. (United Press International dispatch, 24th)

New York - The New York Times' Washington correspondent stated that there is now a proposal in Congress gaining considerable support regarding the lease of British Atlantic bases to the United States. It is presented to President Roosevelt, advocating the cancellation of Britain's war debts to the United States as suitable compensation for 99-year leases on eighteen sites suitable for naval bases. This measure will allow Britain to be free from the restrictions of the Johnson Act, which stipulates that any foreign country that does not repay its war debts to the United States cannot borrow money in the United States. (Reuters dispatch, 24th)

Washington - Secretary of the Navy Knox is currently considering a flight inspection of naval construction in San Francisco, Hawaii, and other Pacific coast areas.

(United Press dispatch, 24th)

### Japan to Make New Demands on the Dutch East Indies; Cabinet Sends Kobayashi as Special Envoy to the Dutch East Indies

London - British sources here predicted yesterday that the Japanese will make new demands on the Dutch East Indies, to transfer mineral resources to Japan and recognize Japan's future right to oversee the production of nickel and chromium there. It is also believed that Japan will soon demand general economic expansion and various freedoms for immigration to the Dutch East Indies. These demands will closely follow the forced abandonment of trade negotiations between Britain and Japan due to the burden of the European war. Japan is now forced to find ways to obtain various raw materials elsewhere, because this year Japan has not been able to obtain nickel and copper from Canada. Apart from obtaining a small amount of scrap iron from India, Japan has not been able to obtain the required materials from Britain. (United Press dispatch, 24th)

Tokyo - The government recently consulted with General Koiso and others, asking him to undertake the mission to the Dutch East Indies.

### African British-Italian War Entering Decisive Phase; Italy Launches Aerial Offensive Against Ethiopia as Prelude to Land Attack

Moscow - The Soviet "Red Star" newspaper recently commented on the African war situation, saying, "The preliminary war in Africa is about to end. The Italian side intends to carry out large-scale operations in both Libya and Sudan. In Sudan, Italian troops have broken into the enemy's lines. It is worth noting that a small number of isolated Italian troops are even more active than British soldiers. After winning in Somaliland, the southern Italian troops concentrated all their forces and launched a general attack on Khartoum, heading straight down the Nile River to avoid being surrounded. At the same time, Italian troops stationed in North Africa will take decisive action in Egypt, seizing the Suez Canal. The British army will take a defensive posture. We expect the African war situation to enter a decisive phase, although the fate of Egypt, Sudan, and other British colonies will still be determined by the Battle of the Straits." (TASS dispatch, 24th)

Rome - Well-informed sources here say that after Italian aircraft heavily bombed Egypt and Sudan, it is believed that the Italian Air Force has launched an aerial blitz against Egypt and Sudan as a prelude to a land attack. The Italian official gazette stated that Italian aircraft had carried out heavy and prolonged bombing of Sidi Barrani, Marsa Matruh, and Alexandria. These places are all located in Egypt. According to the gazette, this bombing was carried out after the Egyptian government decided to send Egyptian troops to join forces with British troops to defend Egyptian territory. The gazette first announced that Italian aircraft had bombed Khartoum, the capital of British Sudan, claiming that the Italian Air Force had begun a systematic attempt to destroy Khartoum's airfields and cripple British troops in Sudan, and claiming that Khartoum's aircraft hangars had been severely damaged by bombs and fire. (United Press dispatch, 24th)

Rome - There is rejoicing here over the heavy Italian air raids on the port of Alexandria and the Italian aircraft attacks on British convoys in the Mediterranean, claiming that the Italian offensive against Egypt is imminent. However, the official gazette reporting on the Italian military's actions cannot further clarify future plans. The official statement also said, "When Italian troops arrive in Egypt, they will not fight the Egyptian people, but will fight the British in Egypt." The official statement also declared, "If Egypt modifies its current judicial situation, its attitude towards Italy will also change," etc. (International dispatch, 24th)

Determined to Abide by Alliance Obligations; Will Not Hesitate to Cross Egyptian Border

London - The newspapers here all expressed enthusiastic praise for the Egyptian government's decision to fight if Italian troops cross the border. The "Daily Mail" reported that Mussolini's sweet words and threats have completely failed to prevent Egypt from hindering and violating its alliance treaty with Britain. The victory of British domestic and Middle East air forces has restored the other party's trust in our country's military strength. The British naval and air forces' combined strength in shattering the Bardia and Capuzzo forts has exposed the false propaganda of Rome and Berlin and proved that British strength is on the rise. Egypt has extremely strong strength to protect its territory against Mussolini's aggression. If fascist legions attempt to advance into a 150-mile waterless desert, they will encounter bombardment by British naval and air forces along the way. In addition to the troops under the command of General Wavell, the British Commander-in-Chief of the Middle East, currently on the battlefield, Egypt will be able to increase the deployment of an army equipped with modern weapons and a very large air force. Egypt has warned the people of the East that Italy threatens the entire civilized world. This is the spirit of resistance aroused by Mussolini's ambition. (Reuters dispatch, 24th)

British Aircraft Heavily Bomb Italian Military Base; Capuzzo Fort Regained and Lost

Cairo - (According to this question last night's news), British air forces yesterday heavily attacked Italian troops in East Africa, thwarting their advance. Four Italian aircraft were shot down, and many military bases were destroyed by bombing. The British Royal Air Force and the South African Air Force are making every effort to disrupt Italy's preparations for attacking Egypt and Aden over Libya and Somaliland. However, the communique acknowledged that the Capuzzo Fort, near the Egyptian border on the Libyan coast, was recaptured on August 17 with the assistance of the British Navy. British dive bombers bombed the Benghazi port, destroying one Italian submarine supply ship, one destroyer, and two submarines, and "severely damaged" a mechanized unit transportation center at an aircraft repair station and on a ship. All British aircraft returned safely. It was also reported that Mogadishu and Asab were also bombed. At the same time, it was heard that Italian aircraft had also raided the port of Alexandria three times, but were all driven back early by British troops, so the damage was very slight. (International Press Agency dispatch, 24th)

Rome - According to the Italian official news agency, authoritative sources mentioned the news circulating in Cairo that an Egyptian division had been stationed next to the British army to defend against Italian invasion, saying that if this statement were true, Italy could not remain silent for long. If Egypt decides to take the same steps as Britain and fight against Italy, then the current situation will change, and Italy will respond accordingly. (Reuters dispatch, 24th)

Turkey Watches the Development of the War; Confidence in Britain Increases

Ankara - The official mouthpiece "Ulus" newspaper stated that Turkish and all Arab people in the Near East, as a result of closely observing the development of the war, especially Britain's air victories, have seen a very obvious increase in their trust in Britain's ultimate victory. From this, it can be seen that conquering Britain is impossible. At present, Turkey's focus is on Egypt first, the attitude of the United States second, and the position of Spain third. The Turkish side fully understands that France's surrender has greatly increased Britain's difficulties in Egypt, but it greatly admires the British side's courage in deciding not to make unnecessary sacrifices in Somaliland, and believes that this move has greatly enhanced Britain's ability to hold Egypt to deal with the enemy. People here believe that the recent developments in the Americas and Spain are most favorable. Furthermore, news that the Soviet Union is dealing with Turkey in a more friendly manner is also encouraging. (Reuters dispatch, 24th)

### Italian Troops Deploy on Albanian Border; Greece Eagerly Seeks Self-Defense; Rome Denies Forcing Greece to Abandon British Guarantee; If Greece Is Invaded, Britain Will Fulfill Promise of Assistance

A Border Town in Greece - There is good reason to believe that Greece does not want to abolish the British guarantee. The Greek cabinet met last night, but the content of the discussion is unknown. Some sources say that regarding Italy's attitude towards Greece, Germany is still exerting its mitigating influence on Italy. (Reuters dispatch, 24th)

London - Rome Wireless Radio announced today that Greek authorities have committed another murder in Albania. According to a report in an Albanian newspaper, a person was found hanged, initially regarded as suicide, but later investigation revealed that he had been murdered. The Italian news agency said that Roman officials did not admit that Italy had telegraphed Greece demanding the abolition of the British guarantee, nor had they heard that Britain was planning to occupy the islands of Corfu and Crete. However, if Greece uses its territory or territorial waters for Britain to fight against Italy, Italy will retaliate in full measure. Reuters diplomatic correspondents heard that Italy is using the Albanian incident as a basis for negotiations with Greece, which is more beneficial to Italy's position, because this matter is not directly related to Italy's prestige, and its pressure can be increased or decreased according to the political needs of the time. (Reuters dispatch, 24th)

Athens - According to reports, Italian mountain troops yesterday deployed in key passes in the Albanian mountains facing the Greek border, as Greece is waiting anxiously for the rapid deterioration of Greek-Italian relations. However, as of now, no skirmishes between reconnaissance troops have occurred. As a result of special consultations between the government and King George of Greece this morning, several levels of troops have been conscripted and will receive one month of training. The troops called into service include machine gun, searchlight, special soldiers, and mechanized units. At the same time, London authorities claimed yesterday, "Britain, no matter what the situation, will be faithful to its promise to Greece." They said that if Greece is attacked, Britain will do its best to provide military assistance. At the same time, the Greeks believe that in addition to British assistance, once invaded, the country will also be able to obtain assistance from Yugoslavia and Turkey. If Greece is occupied by Italian troops, Turkey's position in the Dardanelles will be extremely dangerous. It is generally believed here that although Greece has no national defense, it will be able to do its best to resist. Based on this spirit, the government will be able to obtain the support of the entire country. (United Press dispatch, 28th)

Tirana - According to news received here, over the past day, the Greek authorities in Cameria and Pindus have distributed firearms to Greek residents. The Greek gendarmerie has organized militia, and a colonel has arrived in Janina to command the Greek militia. (Haitong dispatch, 24th)

### Romanian-Hungarian Negotiations Break Down Again; Romanian Authorities Order Air Defense; Hungarian Military Preparations Will Also Be Intensified; Dobruja Agreement Between Romania and Bulgaria to Be Signed

Rome - According to the Stefani news agency, the Romanian-Hungarian negotiations on Outer Transylvania have broken down again. (Reuters dispatch, 24th)

Bucharest - The Romanian-Hungarian negotiations on Outer Transylvania reopened in Turnu Severin yesterday. The Hungarian representative submitted his government's reply to the Romanian government's rejection of the Hungarian side's original demands. At present, the situation is rarely seen in which the prospect of a satisfactory outcome of the negotiations is gradually becoming bright. Romania's attitude of opposing any solution other than the exchange of residents has become strong. The newspapers have published the number of Romanian land forces guarding the border and the navy patrolling the Danube River. Correspondents in Berlin all acknowledged the unsatisfactory nature of the negotiations, but said that German officials hoped that major issues would be resolved as soon as possible. At the same time, in Outer Transylvania, the movement against ceding territory to Hungary is still on the rise. The Romanian-Hungarian border has gradually become restless. The authorities have ordered air defense, and all air defense shelters must be completed by September 15 at the latest. It is heard that the Hungarian side has not obtained Germany's support, and its original broad demands are expected to have been greatly modified. It is heard from responsible sources that the Hungarian side has inquired with Moscow about the Soviet Union's attitude towards Hungary's demands, and the Soviet Union told them that it was not interested in the development of Outer Transylvania. (Reuters dispatch, 24th)

Budapest - In view of the current stalemate in direct negotiations between Hungary and Romania, well-informed observers all believe that German arbitration is ultimately inevitable. The authorities have now ordered severe restrictions on public transportation services. Most public buses will be suspended from tomorrow, and the number of taxis has been greatly reduced. According to unofficial news, railway trains departing from the east have also been greatly reduced. It is expected that military methods will be intensified. (Reuters dispatch, 24th)

Budapest - According to news here last night, Romania has again called four classes of reservists into service, and all military leave passes have been revoked. Observers here believe that because the Romanian-Hungarian negotiations on Outer Transylvania have reached a deadlock, Romania is preparing for the worst. (International Press Agency dispatch, 24th)

Bucharest - It was announced here yesterday that Army Chief of Staff General Tezcunescu has submitted his resignation and has now been replaced by Associate General Michael. (Haitong dispatch, 24th)

### Streets of Aden Filled with British Troops

Aden - The streets here are filled with British troops withdrawn from Somaliland. Although they have experienced hardship, their morale is still very high. There are countless stories of individual and team heroism. It is said that a famous British regiment joined forces with Indian troops to hold their ground against the fierce attacks of superior enemy forces and inflicted heavy casualties on them. The Italian claim that they captured a large number of military supplies and ammunition is completely unfounded. (Reuters dispatch, 24th)

Athens - One of Greece's largest ammunition factories, the Athens Ammunition Factory, accidentally caught fire yesterday and was completely destroyed. The sound of the explosion could be clearly heard in nearby towns. The number of dead and injured has not yet been ascertained. The loss is expected to reach tens of millions of yuan. (Haitong dispatch, 24th)

### Anti-Jewish Movement Extends to France; Government to Promulgate Laws Regulating the Status of Jews

Vichy: French political figures anticipate that the government will soon pass laws regulating the status of Jews in France. Recently, anti-Jewish riots have frequently occurred in various French cities. Simultaneously, French government radio stations have initiated a campaign against Jewish doctors. It is widely believed that Marshal Pétain will announce a special law regarding Jews. A French news agency close to the government recently published an article stating that the Jewish problem in France has become acute. The order protecting Jews issued on April 26, 1939, should be revoked. The article further claims that Jews dominate the legal, medical, journalistic, radio, and film industries. The People's Front government's policy of allowing a large number of Jews to enter the country, which led to problems with participation in the war, should be completely overturned. The anti-Jewish actions in various cities within France are expressions of the demand that the government promptly resolve the Jewish problem. (Haitong Electric Telegram, 24th)

### French Technician Invents Artificial Gasoline

Vichy: An electrical plant technician named Kirar recently invented a type of artificial gasoline that can be used as automobile fuel. Among the various gasoline substitutes available today, it is considered to be the best. It was recently tested publicly in Clermont-Ferrand, with excellent results. It is said that Kirar purchased a small amount of inexpensive minerals near the power plant where he works and, using electricity, combined them to create this product. Therefore, the cost is quite low. (Havas News Agency Electric Telegram, 24th)

### British Air Force Flies Across the Channel, Bombards German Artillery Positions; Distant View of Fires Burning on the French Coast; Two Hundred German Aircraft Attack England Again Yesterday

London: Before 9 PM last night, the lights of German anti-aircraft guns were seen flashing continuously across the English Channel near Boulogne, along several miles of the French coastline, indicating a major British air raid was imminent. Occasionally, bright fires were seen burning, likely caused by bombs. (Reuters Electric Telegram, 24th)

London: The Royal Air Force made a second attack on German artillery positions along the French coast yesterday in seven hours. Yesterday at 10 PM (7 AM Shanghai Summer Time), German anti-aircraft fire could be seen from the southeastern coast of England. According to news agency sources, the anti-aircraft fire in France erupted for several miles, demonstrating the unprecedented intensity of the Royal Air Force's bombardment. Larger flashes of light were seen from time to time, believed to be caused by bombs exploding. According to the Ministry of Aviation, the Royal Air Force conducted another bombing raid on German artillery positions in France on Thursday night and yesterday morning. This attack lasted six hours, ending at 3:35 AM yesterday. (United Press Electric Telegram, 24th)

London: After Dover was bombed, the British Air Force quickly retaliated, heavily bombing German artillery units on the French coast the previous night and yesterday morning. The sound of artillery explosions was incessant. British bombers dropped high-explosive and incendiary bombs on the artillery positions. German fighters and anti-aircraft guns attempted to intercept them. However, according to the Ministry of Aviation, the British attacks lasted for a long time, continuously bombing German artillery units from 9:30 PM Thursday night to 3:35 AM Friday morning. The main target was Cap Gris-Nez, and artillery positions near Audembert and Saint-Inglevert in that area were also bombed. Simultaneously, other bombers conducted their usual nighttime raids on German-occupied airfields along the northern coast and in central France, as well as extremely important locations in Germany. The German targets attacked that night included the petrol refineries in Politz, the aircraft factory in Frankfurt, the power station near Cologne, the high-explosives factory near Frankfurt, and the port of Duisburg on the Rhine River. Twenty-two airfields in Germany and occupied territories were also attacked. According to the Ministry of Aviation, all British bombers returned safely, except for one that was forced to land and its crew perished. (Reuters News Agency Electric Telegram, 24th)

London: Hitler launched his aerial blitzkrieg tactic against England again today. This morning, an estimated 200 German bombers flew into English territory, dropping bombs on military targets along the coast and inland. According to various reports, twelve German aircraft were shot down, while official reports claim that at least three were shot down. (United Press Electric Telegram, 24th)

London: The Ministry of Aviation and the Ministry of Home Security announced that enemy aircraft conducted small-scale operations at night. Bombs fell in several areas of the southeast and southwest, as well as in one area of the Midlands and one area of South Wales. Property was damaged in the Midlands and South Wales, with minimal damage elsewhere. There were very few injuries and no fatalities. This morning, an air raid alert was issued in the London area. Public buses and trams continued to operate as usual, and people flocked to their offices. Other vehicles mostly stopped. Everyone calmly took shelter in air raid shelters and waited, after which the all-clear signal was issued. In the southeastern outskirts of London, bombs fell in open areas, causing minimal damage. Last night's enemy attack lasted the longest in the Midlands area, where two to three hundred high-explosive and incendiary bombs were dropped. Anti-aircraft fire was extremely intense, and property was slightly damaged. There were no reports of deaths or injuries. Single enemy aircraft occasionally flew over a certain town in the southwest, dropping bombs that caused several deaths and injuries. (Reuters News Agency Electric Telegram, 24th)

Berlin: This afternoon, the German military announced that the German Navy sank the British armed merchant ship "Turakina" (8,706 tons) in Australian waters. In the past eight days, German submarines have sunk over 100,000 tons of enemy cargo. One German submarine alone sank three British ships, with a total displacement of no less than 15,000 tons. Another submarine fired a torpedo, damaging an armed merchant ship (11,000 tons). Yesterday, German aircraft attacked ports and dockyard projects, aircraft factories, aircraft manufacturing plants, and military camps in central and eastern England day and night. The armory in Dumbarton was bombed during the day, with flames reaching the clouds and explosions shaking the distance. As a result of the German air raids, the ports of Bristol, Avonmouth, Devonport, and Great Yarmouth, as well as the Cambridge airfield, were either set on fire or exploded, resulting in significant losses. Enemy aircraft bombed western Germany last night, without significant effect. Yesterday, the enemy lost seven aircraft, three of which were shot down by German aircraft and four by anti-aircraft guns. Two German aircraft did not return to their bases. (Haitong News Agency Electric Telegram, 14th)

### German Long-Range Guns Bombard England Again; Three Loud Explosions Heard; Dover Area Shaken

London: At 9 AM this morning, the Dover area was shaken by three loud explosions. It is believed that the shells were fired by German artillery units on the French coast. An alert was issued at the time, notifying people to take cover. No aircraft were seen or heard when the explosions occurred. (Reuters Electric Telegram, 24th)

London: A Reuters diplomatic correspondent states that regarding the German shelling across the English Channel, military experts believe that the guns used by the Germans are approximately 12-inch caliber or slightly larger. We have long known that Germany possesses guns of this caliber. Although this type of German artillery warfare may not bring the war into a new stage, it clearly has considerable nuisance value. Military experts generally believe that the Germans may increase their shelling of the Channel escort convoys, or that the accuracy of their shelling may improve with practice. However, reviewing the results of yesterday's shelling, it can be asserted that the Nazi efforts to blockade the Channel with artillery fire will meet with the same failure as their recent aerial offensive. (Reuters Electric Telegram, 24th)

### The Balkans Become a Powder Keg Again

The Balkan Peninsula has once again fallen into the dangerous situation of the past. For many years, it has been known as the powder keg of Europe. Armies travel on muddy roads, and great empires appear and disappear in a flash. Twenty-six years ago, incessant warfare erupted like a volcano in the Balkans. Neighboring powers vied for dominance, resulting in a global conflagration. Currently, the flames of war have first ignited elsewhere, but the threat of war is again reverberating in the Balkans.

Emergency decrees have spread from the Aegean Sea to the Carpathian Mountains. Troops march across uncultivated fields. Every night, several artillery units rumble westward along the rutted roads of Turkish Thrace. Bulgarian farmers trade homespun cloth for military uniforms, traveling north on shaky trains.

The Hungarian General Staff is hastily deploying troops to defend the plains near the Tisza River and the foothills of the Lesser Russian Mountains. Romania has been under martial law ever since it was forced to cede its eastern border provinces. Mobilization has been fully implemented, and every city is under nightly blackout restrictions to prevent danger.

And around this area, the great powers are all watching each other with jealousy. Soviet troops are moving ever closer to Germany, deploying along the Prut and Siret rivers, a short distance from the strategically important Danube Delta, and only half an hour by plane from Romania's abundant oilfields. Rumors of German mechanized units moving east are also rampant. On the Adriatic Sea, Albania and Istria, Italy is watching the restless peninsula with anxious eyes.

Historically speaking, the Balkan Peninsula is similar to the situation at the beginning of this century, when the German and Russian empires both crossed the Danube River and came into contact with each other. At that time, the Russian sphere of influence extended to Serbia and as far as the Adriatic Sea, where the small kingdom of Montenegro, located before the European war, was located.

Kaiser Wilhelm II cleverly exploited the ambitious Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand, who hoped to create a South Slav state under Austrian protection. In this way, the unwieldy Austrian Empire was effectively controlled by Germany, and the interests of the opposing German and Russian states unfolded in small countries such as Romania and Bulgaria.

Signs of a similar situation are emerging again under modern, complex circumstances. The Soviet Union and Germany constantly declare that their relations are good, but the hidden situation is quite the opposite.

The current encroachment of these two countries on Eastern Europe, and the era when German power invaded Bosnia and Herzegovina through Austria in 1908, and when pro-Russian elements in Serbia assassinated a pro-German king and established a pro-Russian government, have many similarities.

The main countries with conflicting interests in the Balkans are currently Germany and the Soviet Union. Italy only occupies an important position because it is an ally of Germany, because Italy alone cannot play any role outside of the Mediterranean and Adriatic coasts. Britain and France once occupied a position in the Balkans using Turkey, but this position suddenly ended in June of this year.

Romania is currently the focal point of competition between opposing powers. Although some believe that the German-Soviet agreement last August included a rumored provision to cede Bessarabia to the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union's timely move to occupy Bessarabia surprised Germany. This assumption is that the Soviet Union fears that after a crushing victory for Germany, it may not be as generous as it hopes, and that the Soviet Union believes that war between its neighbors is inevitable and must quickly obtain militarily valuable locations that are needed.

As the reporter is writing, Soviet troops are pouring into the occupied area. Some believe that the Soviet Union may want to occupy Moldavia and the Danube Delta, as well as Northern Dobruja, which could serve as a bridge to the Slavic nations of Bulgaria and South Slavs.

On the other hand, Germany still wants to restrain ambitious Hungary, a country that has been constantly negotiating for the return of Outer Transylvania for twenty-one years, and whose army is now eager to seize the territory as its own. Bulgaria does not have such rash and reckless actions, because the Bulgarian government firmly believes that the lost province of Southern Dobruja should be returned to Bulgaria in any case, so it is not worth going to war over. It is believed that, during this period, Germany is unwilling to clash with the Soviet Union because it still has affairs with the British Empire.

Germany still needs supplies from the Balkan countries, so it does not need blind competition to disrupt Balkan traffic. Germany feels that once it can eliminate Britain, dealing with the Soviet Union is easy. Germans claim that they are fully prepared, because they only need to draw twenty-five divisions from the two hundred and forty divisions attacking France to meet the needs of attacking the British Isles. Even so, the Germans claim that it would be wiser to wait for an appropriate time before advancing east.

The Soviet Union's direct threat to Germany is its air base, only half an hour's flight from the Romanian oilfields. If the Soviet Union occupies these oil wells with paratroopers and then occupies Moldavia, it can threaten Germany's needed fuel for the invasion of England. If Germany attacks it, the Soviet Union can destroy the oil wells and refineries.

The Romanian government is desperately turning to Germany, asking it to help prevent dangers on the eastern border. But at the moment, Germany does not seem willing to offend the Soviet Union and conclude a treaty with Romania, even if Romania fulfills all the necessary treaties and adjusts relations between Hungary and Bulgaria.

The Balkans have once again become full of explosive primers. The current crisis may pass safely without exploding, or it may not. That depends on the Soviet Union. Opposing forces are active throughout the Balkans. The Bulgarian government is very pro-German, but its people are agitated by Soviet propaganda. Yugoslavia is restrained on the one hand by its Eastern blood ties, and on the other hand by the practical environment of its Western borders.

It is not yet clear whether the Soviet Union's goal is world revolution. But in any case, the tradition of Pan-Slavism is a good tool to resist Germany's eastward control of the East European continent. In both countries, there is a mixture of ideological formation and expansion of power. The coming days will see whether the flames in the Balkans are rising high, or whether it will not happen immediately, but the time is not very far away. (Translated from The New York Times)

### Japan Plans to Force Dissolution of Labor Unions

Tokyo: The Japanese government has decided that all independent labor unions, if they do not "voluntarily" disband, will be forced to join the "Industrial Patriotic Association." Japan's military and economic problems are becoming increasingly acute due to the prolonged Sino-Japanese conflict. Therefore, it wants to encourage the patriotic enthusiasm of the people to a greater extent, in order to quickly solve these problems. However, whether Japanese labor unions will immediately dissolve is still uncertain, because the chairman of the Japanese labor union is not legally obliged to follow the dissolution proposal of the Japanese Minister of the Army. According to the chairman of the Japanese labor union, all Japanese workers can be patriotic, and it has nothing to do with whether Japanese workers are members of labor unions or the "Industrial Patriotic Association."

### Finance: Active Foreign Exchange Swap Trading

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no change in HSBC's listed rates. The unofficial market for British and American exchange rates remained in a state of fluctuation. The previous day saw a slight easing, but yesterday it softened again. Although trading was active, there was no excitement. Market participants were indecisive, especially speculators who were constantly buying and selling, which had a significant impact. Chinese banks engaged in active trading, with many swaps being made. Although the American banks Citibank and Chase, and the British bank Jardine Matheson, actively sold, the market trend was still softening. Around 11:30 AM, the US dollar softened to $5.5625, then recovered slightly, ultimately closing at $5.59375, tightening by 0.03125, while the British pound tightened by 0.015625, closing at 3 shillings and 6.875 pence.

HSBC's listed rates were announced unchanged. The silver equalization tax was announced to increase by 0.25%. After this, Chinese banks and speculators developed buying interest, and prices softened slightly. US banks such as Chase bought this month's US dollar at $5.625 to $5.25.

### 銀錢業中　積習難改　少數不良分子　常使顧客難堪

Bad Habits in the Banking Industry Are Hard to Change; A Few Unscrupulous Individuals Often Embarrass Customers

Recently, there has been an abundance of idle capital in this city, and the amount of legal tender has increased accordingly. In previous months, arbitrage on foreign exchange could reach 30-40%, but last month it was only about 10%. This month, because there is not much difference, the difference between this month's and next month's US dollar is only 0.03125, and the difference in British pounds is 0.015625. Arbitrage transactions have virtually stopped, and the use of cash has suddenly narrowed. As a result, a small number of banks, when presented with checks marked "cash" by customers, submit them to the paying bank for exchange or entrust them to the reserve for collection, but actually issue "only cash accepted" as the reason for returning the check. In fact, cash and clearing are originally the same thing. If "only cash accepted" is used as the reason for returning the check, it not only hinders the circulation of negotiable instruments, but also poses a great risk in the current state of this city. It is hoped that banks with such practices will no longer create difficulties. It would be best if the association notified its members to reiterate that cash and clearing are originally one and the same, and should not insist on customers accepting cash simply because there is a temporary lack of use for cash. However, when the demand for cash is strong, they fear that people will withdraw cash. Many in the banking industry only care about their own interests and make things difficult for customers, especially the tellers. Few bank employees have a calm attitude. Most are arrogant and indifferent to customers. Banks treat customers so poorly, and there will eventually be a day of retribution. Watching them leave in dismay, closing their doors, and regretting it will be too late. (English)

### 中國二角新票　色澤素凈安閑

New 20-Cent Chinese Note Features Simple and Elegant Colors

Because one-yuan banknotes and subsidiary currency notes are insufficient in this city, HSBC has specially transported one-yuan notes and 10-cent and 20-cent notes from Hong Kong to make adjustments. The design of the new 10-cent Chinese note has been detailed in this newspaper on the 22nd. Now, a new type of 20-cent note from the Bank of China has arrived. The front is light tan, and the back has green on both sides, with 20 and Twenty Cents printed in the middle, surrounded by brown-green edges. The colors are simple and elegant, offering a different flavor from the bright and dazzling 10-cent notes. (See attached picture for the design) It is rumored that the newly arrived one-yuan notes are the red notes of the fourth printing by the Central Bank, which can be exchanged at the reserve. The 10-cent notes will be accepted by HSBC and the Bank of China.

### 英鎊票　可掉換支單　市場價已穩定

Pound Notes Can Be Exchanged for Checks; Market Price Has Stabilized

Yesterday, the foreign currency market was rising steadily, with British and American pounds also rising by one yuan each. The decline in pound notes has stopped, and the market price has suddenly rebounded. It is said that holders of pound notes can exchange them for checks at a certain British bank, but a handling fee is required. This has calmed people down, and holders are no longer eager to sell. The market price has risen to 53.50 yuan, an increase of 1.90 yuan compared to the previous day. US dollar notes followed the upward trend, reaching 17.92 yuan in the evening, an increase of 0.19 yuan compared to the previous day. There was a demand for Hong Kong notes, and the price rose by 0.02 yuan. The rise in Japanese yen notes and Korean notes has stopped, and the market price has stabilized. The former remains at 1.455 yuan, and the latter remains at 1.085 yuan.

### 證券　內債又見轉機

Securities: Domestic Debt Sees Another Turnaround

The securities grey market remained sluggish yesterday. However, the situation changed in the afternoon as a certain bank came in to absorb at low prices, and the bulls gradually lost their strength. Tongxinghao suddenly bought in large quantities at the close. After the close, it was heard that there were no problems with the US military taking over the defense of this port, and the grey market was slightly firmer. Yesterday's trading saw Jiufeng, Lianhe, and Lianyi buying throughout the morning and afternoon. Hongkang, Shunheng, and Hengfu also bought, but No. 38 turned to selling. The Xinfu bulls continued to sell, and Xieda and retail investors showed strong selling sentiment in the evening. In the morning, it was slightly down by 0.02-0.03 yuan, and in the afternoon, No. 38 bought domestic E shares cheaply. Zhongyi Trust bought in eagerly, and Yitai and Hongda also bought in. Tongxinghao suddenly bought in large quantities near the close, with Tongkang being the main seller. Hengfu sold slightly, and No. 20 also sold. As a result, it continued to fall slightly by 0.05-0.25 yuan, with E shares falling by only 0.05 yuan due to their low market price. The total turnover was around 1.1 million yuan. A brief table is listed below.

Yesterday's stock trading saw 50 shares of the stock exchange being traded, with a price of 25 yuan per share.

London, 23rd (Friday) - Today's listed prices of Chinese foreign debt and Far East British company stocks were generally calm. Only bank stocks showed a slight decline.

### 糧食　洋米交易清淡

Grains: Imported Rice Trading Is Sluggish

The imported rice market was fluctuating yesterday, rising and falling sharply, often with differences of 0.03-0.05 yuan. However, the result was still similar to the previous market. Because the inventory of imported rice is sufficient, new goods continue to arrive, and digestion is weak, the market price is difficult to raise. However, with the new prices not being set, the owners are unwilling to sell cheaply, and speculators and those in the interior are also taking advantage of the small profits. The market is also not easy to suppress, but actual sales are not smooth, and transactions are finally sluggish. Speculators are beginning to realize that the market is difficult to boost, so they are also dumping, and the market color has entered a weary state. The closing prices showed a depreciation of 0.03-0.05 yuan. No. 1 aged Saigon was 58.03 yuan and 58 yuan, new pointed rice was 56-57 yuan, and No. 2 was 53.50 yuan. The transaction volume of spot rice was also less than 4,500 bags. Trading of original-package Yinghua Sze was not completed.

1,300-1,400 bags of japonica and glutinous domestic rice continued to arrive. Market rumors, one being that there was too much stock, and the second being that they were restrained by the imported rice, the news was all weary. The price fell by about 0.5 yuan. Changbang fresh Qing japonica was 67 yuan, Wuxi Qing japonica was 65-66 yuan, Changzhou Sukun japonica was 64-65 yuan, then to about 60 yuan, old thin rice was 62 yuan, Nangang original package early rice was 62-63 yuan, particularly fresh rice was 62 yuan, ordinary rice was 60 yuan, and then to 58 yuan. Glutinous rice Jinli special yuan was 61.50 yuan and 61 yuan, Changzhou white yuan was 60 yuan, Danyang was 58-59 yuan, Hong Kong special yuan was 61 yuan, Zhongguan was 58 yuan, and Yuan was 54 yuan, etc. The source of Zhoupu new japonica was also more abundant than before, with more than 40 loads, but the sales market felt sluggish, so the opening price was weary. Chong special goods were sold at 62 yuan, and Zhongguan was 61 yuan.

### 粉麥湧到　月餅訉銷路不旺

Flour and Wheat Flood In; Mooncake Sales Are Not Strong

The flour market was particularly calm yesterday. Due to transportation difficulties, new transactions are unlikely to develop. Although the retail market is in the midst of the mooncake season, the demand is not comparable to the past. Therefore, although the output of Fuxin and Fufeng factories is small, it is sufficient to meet the needs of this street. The factory price is still 15 yuan. The two factories ship out 3,000-4,000 bags per day. The market is calm. The trading of Japanese flour Phoenix brand is also not much. The September price is 14.75 yuan, and the October price is 14.90 yuan. Because the recovered goods are running out, futures are still tight by about 0.20 yuan. The spot price is not conducive to the environment and lacks transactions.

Furthermore, yesterday it was heard that a new ship of imported flour had arrived, totaling more than 100,000 bags, all of which are the Fortress and Asahi brands. The goods are still being unloaded. It was also heard that a ship of wheat ordered by Fuxin had also been imported. With imported flour and wheat flooding in at the same time, the market may be difficult to improve for a while.

The wheat market continued to be calm. Due to the weekend, arrivals and sales were equally quiet. Japanese factories such as Sanxin and Xiexing were slow to buy, and the sellers also attached great importance to the eating plate, holding on and unwilling to sell easily. Therefore, the transaction volume was only 1,000-2,000 bags. It was heard that imported wheat was being shipped in batches, and the price had secretly loosened by 0.03-0.05 yuan.

### 油市　生油現貨　於疲跌中得買戶

Oil Market: Crude Oil Spot Market Finds Buyers Amidst a Weary Decline

Yesterday morning, the peanut oil market initially continued the previous day's weakness, with futures continuing to fall by 1 yuan. As a result, more than 3,000 pieces of Jiaozhou oil were traded, with the price for the second half of September being 59 yuan and the price for the first half of October being 60 yuan. 100 barrels of Qingdao oil were ordered for September delivery, with the price being 88 yuan. The spot oil, under the heavy decline, attracted buyers from the interior, causing speculators to take the opportunity to push up prices. Buying interest turned strong, and the market price immediately rose sharply. A total of more than 1,500 pieces were traded, with prices ranging from 60 yuan to 62 yuan. Soybean oil consequently stabilized, with 50 barrels of Dalian oil being traded at 97 yuan and 100 dan of Dayouyu factory oil being traded at 74 yuan, according to old warehouse receipts.

The amount of oil beans and miscellaneous grains exported today was also not small. 1,105 tins of crude oil were shipped to Xiamen, and another 610 tins were shipped to Hong Kong. There were also 300 pieces of soybean oil and 34 bags of soybeans shipped to Hong Kong, 500 bags of soybeans and 500 pieces of soybean cake shipped to Singapore, 3,500 pieces of soybean cake and 120 bags of wheat shipped to Xiamen, and 40 pieces of soybean cake shipped to Siam.

### 紗花　紗市迂廻前進

Yarn and Cotton: The Yarn Market Advances Circuitously

The yarn market continued to rise, and the upward trend reappeared, but actual transactions still showed little progress. However, speculative sentiment was very good. This was because the consolidation had been going on for a long time, and the general amount of absorption was firmly unwilling to give up. Therefore, the chips on the table were tight. The market is advancing circuitously. However, according to the inventory report, the inventory of yarn in various warehouses is increasing daily. As soon as the bulls can make a profit, they sell, and the market changes quickly.

The spot yarn market opened in the morning with a very tight atmosphere. Everyone wanted to buy and grab bull positions. As a result, the table felt very weak. The price of 20-count Double Horse was 938 yuan, an increase of 5 yuan compared to the previous day. After a while, it fell slightly to 934 yuan. At this time, buying interest suddenly increased, and it rose again to 942-943 yuan, hovering for a long time. After the bulls slightly released, it fell back to 937-938 yuan. Around 11 o'clock, the bulls came back to life, tracking and hedging empty positions, and gradually rising to 947 yuan, but after the close, it returned to 941 yuan. According to the half-day transaction statistics, 2,645 bales were traded. The price of 20-count Double Horse rose by 15 yuan. Today, 255 pieces of yarn were shipped to Siam, 445 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong, and 81 pieces were shipped to Xiamen. The amount of yarn purchased by each gang is as follows:

Fellow traders 2,150, Ningbo 50, Hong Kong 185
Yunnan 140, Wenzhou 20, total 2,645

### 棉市仍無特色

The Cotton Market Still Has No Distinctive Features

The situation with spot cotton is that there was a slightly excited atmosphere in the past, but this newspaper has already learned that there is no hope for large-scale development from all parties. Because the yarn price is not rising, and all parties have sufficient inventory, the cotton market cannot rise sharply, and the future is still not very good. Fellow traders have slightly traded, with White Locke priced at 197 yuan, Fire Machine Flower at 158 yuan, and Houston at 208 yuan. The market price remains stagnant, with no distinctive features and a downward trend.

### 疋頭　國布前途　仍看稪航能否實現　東疋棉紗已見活動

Piece Goods: The Future of Domestic Cloth Still Depends on Whether Navigation Can Be Restored; Eastern Piece Cotton Yarn Has Seen Activity

Domestic Cloth

Yesterday, the cloth market showed a glimmer of hope with the resumption of navigation between Zhejiang and Fujian. Cotton yarn in eastern pieces reported an increase in price, and the market trend slightly turned lively. The northern gang and Nanyang gang in this street had a slightly stronger intention to buy, and the market plate was firm. The asking price increased by 0.025 yuan per piece, but the actual transaction price was mostly the original plate from the previous day. More than 500 pieces of various cloths were traded in this street. The Northern Route Yanjin gang transacted more than 200 pieces of colored cloth, coarse cloth, twill money cloth, etc. The Nanyang gang transacted more than 8,000 pieces of colored cloth, bleached cloth, printed cloth, and twill. Because whether the navigation line in Zhejiang and Fujian can be smoothly operated is still in question, most people are unwilling to take risks and are watching and waiting.

Eastern Cloth

The fellow traders and speculators in this street are bullish and have a strong desire to buy. 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth opened in the morning at 31.03 yuan, rose to 31.06 yuan, and closed. The market atmosphere continued to tighten in the afternoon, rising gradually. At the close, it was 31.085 yuan. Four Gentlemen Biji rose to 0.09275 yuan per yard. Mid-range miscellaneous brand fine cloth and fine twill also increased by 0.025-0.05 yuan per piece.

Export

Today, 12 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Xiamen, 697 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong, and 197 pieces were shipped to Siam.

### 國產防雨布暢銷

Domestically Produced Rainproof Cloth Sells Well

The rainproof cloth produced by the domestic Yousheng Factory has recently been selling quite well, especially with Western clothing stores and raincoat makers in the Daxin Street area making very large purchases. This is because Western rainwear cloth is expensive, and Eastern goods are in extremely short supply. Only China Icy Company and the Shanghai Raincoat Fabric Factory have a slight output of domestic goods, but because they do not sell materials and only sell ready-made raincoats, they have not been popularized, which has created a good opportunity for the Yousheng Factory's rainproof cloth to sell well. Yesterday it was heard that Rentaihao in Juyuanfang, Fujian Road, opened and purchased more than 10,000 yards, with the transaction price being 3.09 yuan. Light and dark beige, cyan-gray, and navy blue were all the same. Most of the Chinese clothing shops sell navy blue, while Western raincoat shops mostly use beige.

### 糖市　下檔車白回好

Sugar Market: Lower-Grade Refined White Sugar Recovers

The sugar market trend was stable yesterday, with little fluctuations. The association set the price for spot goods at 73.08 yuan per ton for first-grade coarse white sugar from local warehouses, up 0.03 yuan, 73 yuan for goods arriving on April 7, 73.50 yuan for new goods from foreign warehouses, 58.02 yuan for re-export goods, and 58.50 yuan for goods arriving on August 15. Taikoo refined white sugar B mark remained at 74 yuan, DY mark was 69.45 yuan, up 0.5 yuan, HX mark was 69.34 yuan, up 7.89 yuan, Dutch red mark was 61 yuan, 61.50 yuan for goods arriving on September 6, and then tightened to 63 yuan, but no deal was made. According to the Dutch telegraph, it was 10.50. The rest of the local refined white sugar and first-grade ice sugar had little fluctuation, and domestic sugar was not yet available.

### 南北貨　槐米獻新

North and South Goods: Locust Flower Rice Offers New

Locust flower rice has been sluggish for a long time due to the slow sales and dull market. Yesterday it was heard that more than ten new pieces of goods had been transported to the number shops, and the goods were in good condition and color. However, because the market is sluggish, it is feared that it will be difficult to sell well.

### 五金　盤元銷路奇呆

Hardware: Wire Rod Sales Are Strangely Stagnant

The new wire rod market has recently been fluctuating due to the sudden changes in foreign exchange, so the market price has also been rising and falling. It was found that the price of Japanese nails fell the day before yesterday, but the foreign exchange did not show any relaxation, so the standard remains firm. It was found that the price of Japanese nails was 45 yuan per case, but the asking price for wire rod was 47-48 yuan per load, so most of the nail manufacturers stopped or reduced production after seeing this situation. On the contrary, they saw the strangely stagnant sales of the produced goods (Japanese nails), so the people in this industry became more and more tired, and the market atmosphere was also decaying. To save this decline, it is necessary to sell the wire nails produced by the factories in this street overseas. However, the recent closure of the sea ports has caused both domestic and southern sales to be cut off, so it is difficult to improve the trend for a while. The sales of new wire rod will also suffer a major setback.

### 煤炭　開平塊挺俏

Coal: Kailan Lump Coal Is Rising and Attractive

Kailan lump coal has been in short supply for a long time, and the supply has not been abundant. Sales are even stronger. The streets, knowing that it is difficult to receive goods, have to follow the market and take it. The market has continued to rise. Kailan No. 1 mixed coal is 170 yuan per ton, screened lump coal is 190 yuan, No. 1 and 2 mixed coal is 155 yuan, and lump coal is 175 yuan. The above are the discounted prices for fellow traders, and customers are charged a small amount for delivery.

### Medicinal Materials　Armadillo Scales Rise Ten Dollars

Armadillo scales have recently been in short supply and arrivals are infrequent, while demand remains active. As a result, market prices have continued to rise. The current market price is 210 yuan, which is about 10 yuan higher than in the early part of this month. The future market may continue to be tight, depending on how the demand for stomach ailments shifts.

### The Problem of Defense Areas Left by British Troops Has Not Yet Reached a Resolution Stage, Officials Continue to Remain Silent on This Matter, No Definite Date Yet for Japanese Troops to Take Over the Western District

Yesterday, business circles in Shanghai once again expressed deep concern regarding which party would permanently take over the defense of the "Ding" and "Yi" districts after the withdrawal of American troops. It has been a week since the compromise solution was proposed, but the Japanese side has not yet moved into the Western District of Shanghai. According to general opinion, this is sufficient to prove that the Japanese side is not yet satisfied with the International Settlement Volunteer Corps taking over from the British troops. It is understood that the Japanese side is unwilling to take over the Western District because they do not want the people of Shanghai to believe that the Japanese side has at least partially agreed to the decision made by the Defense Committee. This is because they have consistently insisted that all British troop defense areas should be taken over by the Japanese troops. Yesterday morning, officials continued to remain silent on this issue, even remaining tight-lipped about whether Washington and Tokyo are still negotiating the issue of "who will take over from the British troops."

British Cavalry Deployed Last Night

Since the International Settlement Volunteer Corps' armored car unit was issued rifles by the Settlement authorities the night before, it has moved to the Western District of Hongkou to take over the defense duties of some vacationing members of the A-Character Battalion. Furthermore, the Volunteer Corps Commander, Hemphill, also summoned the light cavalry unit of the cavalry regiment yesterday afternoon to deploy at 7 PM last night. This light cavalry unit is also a British contingent, and its new task, like the previously summoned armored car unit, is to remedy the inadequacy of the A-Character Battalion's forces and thereby strengthen the defense of the area. The quota for this light cavalry unit is 110 men, but the actual number is currently around 70 men.

Remarks Made by Japanese Spokesperson

The Shanghai Times reports that a Japanese naval spokesperson, at a press reception last night (23rd), could not issue a definitive statement regarding the new method for redefining the foreign military defense areas in Shanghai. It is reported that, to his knowledge, the Japanese naval landing force has not yet specified a definite date for dispatching troops to take over the "Ding" defense area in the Western District of Shanghai. When a reporter asked whether the establishment of the new police force in the Western District would be changed if the Japanese troops were assigned to take over the "Ding" defense area, the spokesperson replied that these were two separate issues. The issue of the new police force has not yet reached the final stage. The spokesperson also stated that, in his opinion, the Japanese troops might not enter and garrison the "Ding" defense area until the outstanding issue of the "Yi" defense area is resolved through negotiations. However, he expects that the defense area issue will be resolved soon.

Increased Scrutiny of Automobile Licenses

The English-language Great Shanghai Evening Post reports that several "municipal police" have been meticulously inspecting the licenses of passing automobiles and various vehicles at the intersection of Yu Yuan Road and Di Feng Road in recent days. It is said that the "municipal police" in the area have been intensifying the inspection of vehicle licenses for two days, so almost all automobiles have been inspected. Many believe that this move is a harbinger that the "Shanghai Municipal Government" will begin to force all vehicles to obtain licenses next month.

Rumor Has It That the Japanese Side Intends to Draft a New Plan

At the same time, there is a rumor circulating that the Japanese authorities in the city are currently drafting a new plan regarding the jurisdiction of roads outside the settlement in the Western District. Both the Shanghai Municipal Council and the "Municipal Government" remain silent. However, government officials hint that the Shanghai Municipal Council will certainly not permit any changes to the Western District Agreement concluded in February.

### The Germans Recruit Chinese Laborers in France and Raise Wages

Since the outbreak of the European War, more than a thousand Chinese living in France have returned to their home country one after another. This is because, after the war, France imposed very strict restrictions on all work and activities of foreign residents, whether in industry, commerce, or as students. After the German troops occupied Paris, they exercised even more direct control, prohibiting vendors from setting up stalls on the streets, which made it impossible for foreign residents to maintain their livelihoods. As a result, the number of unemployed people increased dramatically, reaching tens of thousands. In order to facilitate the war against Britain and expedite the production of military supplies, the Germans are vigorously recruiting Chinese from all over France. Their wages have also increased from five francs to twenty francs per hour.

### The British London Banknote Ban Has Little Impact on Trade, Normal Trade Transactions Are Mostly in Drafts, the Real Purpose Is to Eliminate the British Banknote Market and Prevent Germany from Remitting British Banknotes to Neutral Countries

The Continental Daily News reports that the British government has issued a plan to prohibit the import of Bank of England banknotes into Britain. Many merchants are asking whether the free British gold on the Shanghai market will disappear after the British government takes this action. It should be known that this new regulation only applies to banknotes, and the method of payment by banknotes has never occupied any important position in international trade, because the main medium of exchange in international trade

is drafts.

However, under special circumstances, once a transaction involves expensive insurance fees, especially under the current war conditions, there is indeed the practice of remitting banknotes to London to settle the outstanding accounts. According to a representative of a certain British bank, as far as he can remember, the bank has never used banknotes for remittance in the past five years. Therefore, the impact of the British government's new plan

is only that Shanghai will no longer have a market for British banknotes from August 28th. However, other payment methods, such as drafts, checks, and letters of credit, will continue to be traded. Due to the shrinking free British gold market, drafts and the like will not be traded on a large scale. However, this matter has nothing to do with the aforementioned steps taken by the British government. As the current situation reveals, the British government is determined to

prevent the German side

from having the opportunity to remit British pound banknotes from occupied areas to neutral countries, and for British bank agencies in neutral countries to accept them. New York and Shanghai still have a demand for free British gold, because the avenues for using free gold pounds have not been completely closed. Japan is still able to settle outstanding accounts with some British gold group countries, such as India, so Japanese banks are purchasing British gold on the Shanghai exchange market. However, the intention of the British authorities is to eliminate the free British gold market as soon as possible and base all transactions on the official exchange rate.

### A Singapore Western Newspaper Reporter Discusses Japan's Temporary Non-Invasion of the South, Will Decide on Future Actions Based on the Outcome of the European War, The Occupied Chinese Territory Will Ultimately Not Be Maintained

The English-language Great Shanghai Evening Post reports that Mr. White, the economic editor of the Malay Straits Times, is passing through Shanghai on his way back to Singapore from the United States. According to his discussion, the United States is quite concerned about the activities of the German Fifth Column, and manufacturers are admittedly uneasy about the secret sabotage of the Fifth Column. When he was in the United States, only one

airplane factory

had already experienced three instances of secret sabotage. Today, the members of the Fifth Column in the United States no longer attempt to curry favor with public opinion, and their main purpose is to obstruct industrial production, especially to hinder the production of airplanes, and are proceeding with the greatest vigor. Since the German invasion of the Netherlands, American public opinion seems to be more supportive of the Allied countries, so the majority of the American public now supports actively assisting the Allied countries, except for participating in the war. He believes that the United States will not participate in the war. Mr. White also said that,

when he passed through Japan

on this trip, he received treatment that was extremely unfriendly, which he had never encountered before in other places. The recent arrest of British residents in Japan may be because some of the arrested British people were known to be pro-Japanese. Mr. White feels that Japan has reached a point where it is financially strapped, and a shortage of money cannot be supported indefinitely by force. He believes that Japan's southward advance will not be launched at present and will be decided based on the outcome of the European war. Furthermore, the question of whether Japan

can maintain

the territory it has occupied in China is quite problematic. He personally believes that Japan cannot maintain it, because the Chinese side has always planned to recover the lost territory. Mr. White concluded by saying that half of Singapore's population is Chinese, who strongly support China. Looking at the entire Malay Archipelago, the population is five million, and there are many Chinese. According to Mr. White, this is his first visit to China and Japan, and he is scheduled to leave Shanghai on Sunday to return to Singapore.

### High Tide Abated Yesterday

The high tide in the Huangpu River has receded to below ten feet since yesterday, so it is gradually abating. However, the water level outside Wusongkou is steeply high due to the rapid discharge of water from the Yangtze River. Also, according to the investigation, there will still be high tides in the Huangpu River next month, and the water level will not be stable until after autumn.

### British Military Officers and Their Families Boarded Ships and Left Shanghai for Australia, All British Troops Can Be Withdrawn Tomorrow

The departure of various ships for the withdrawal of British troops has been slightly delayed. The Jardine Matheson's Yongsheng ship docked at the Shuntai Wharf in Hongkou. After the British troops boarded the ship the day before yesterday, it moved to Roosevelt Buoys Nos. 2 and 3 yesterday morning and weighed anchor at 11 AM. The British Company's Tanda ship, which docked at the Gonghexiang Wharf and was scheduled to carry the families of British military officers, left port yesterday morning after the boarding. It sailed south from the Wusongkou at 1 PM (Customs Time) together with the Yongsheng ship.　Three Ships to Weigh Anchor Today and Tomorrow

The Haosheng ship, originally docked at Buoys Nos. 11, 12, and 13, moved to the Shuntai Wharf this morning. The British military baggage and supplies that should be loaded on the ship were transported onto the ship yesterday. It is scheduled to leave Shanghai this afternoon. The Desheng ship, which carried 160 British troops withdrawn from North China from Tianjin and landed in Shanghai, moved to the Ruirong Shipyard Wharf in Yangshupu and berthed there. The cabins are being painted, and the work is scheduled to be completed today. It will also move to the Shuntai Wharf tonight or tomorrow morning to facilitate the boarding of British troops. It is scheduled to depart tomorrow. The British Company's Nakunda ship, which arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong last Sunday (18th) and berthed at Buoys Nos. 11 and 12, is also being used to transport some of the families of British military officers. It is scheduled to weigh anchor and leave port at 4 PM tomorrow afternoon. It is generally expected that all British troops will be able to leave Shanghai tomorrow.

Officers' Families Travel to Australia Together

The English-language Great Shanghai Evening Post reports that the families of the British military personnel stationed in Shanghai are leaving Shanghai for Australia today on the Tanda ship. This is a harbinger that the remaining British troops still in Shanghai will depart as soon as possible. Those departing on the Tanda ship include Mrs. Simmons, the wife of Major General Simmons, the commander of the British garrison in Shanghai, and Mrs. Ashmore, the wife of Major Ashmore. It is expected that tomorrow morning (25th), another batch of British troops will go to the Gonghexiang Wharf to board transport ships to Hong Kong and Singapore. A total of five ships are transporting British troops, and it is expected that they will set sail with troops tomorrow afternoon and Sunday.

### Farewell Luncheon for Arnold Scheduled for September 4th at the Country Club

The Great Shanghai Evening Post reports that the farewell banquet for Mr. Arnold, the American Commercial Counselor to China, by the American community in Shanghai has been scheduled for 8 PM on September 4th at the Country Club. Members of the American Association and their relatives and friends will gather for a grand banquet to bid farewell to Mr. and Mrs. Arnold. The president of the association will also deliver a farewell speech to his American friends after the banquet. Because the association's facilities can only accommodate 300 people, a notice has been issued asking those who plan to attend the farewell banquet to reserve seats at the association early. Mr. Arnold's residency and service in China and Shanghai is the longest among the American community. His service in China began 38 years ago, when he only served as an interpreter, and later he was transferred to the position of Commercial Counselor to China. He initially resided in Beijing, and ten years ago, he moved to Shanghai, where he has remained until today. During this long period of service, Mr. and Mrs. Arnold have been renowned among Americans and people of other countries, and they are also very friendly with Chinese officials and businessmen. They have no less than hundreds of close Chinese friends, and they all feel saddened by their departure.

### Japanese Newspaper Reports That British Soldiers Beat Someone, This Is Absolutely Not the Case

The British Embassy Officially Denies the Report The English-language Great Shanghai Evening Post reports that a Japanese newspaper today (24th) carried a report that two British soldiers from the Seaforth Highlanders, who were drunk, beat someone and were arrested by a patrol team from the Japanese Naval Landing Force and the Japanese Consulate Police Department. A spokesman for the British Embassy has denied this. It is reported that the British soldiers from the Seaforth Highlanders did not have any unfortunate incidents with the Japanese.

### Scheduled Departure of Coastal Defense Ships

Regarding the shipping routes between Shanghai and coastal defense areas, shipping industry sources yesterday and today expressed concern due to the intensifying situation in Vietnam. However, it is understood that all ships heading to Haiphong are prepared to sail as scheduled. Apart from the Shandong ship, which sailed to coastal defense areas at 6:00 AM yesterday, the Qingyuan and Mingsheng ships are also scheduled to sail to Vietnam on the 28th. The Taisheng ship is scheduled to depart on the 3rd of next month. Additionally, the French postal ship, the Xijiang, will sail directly to Haiphong at 8:30 AM this morning. According to the company, after the Xijiang unloads passengers and cargo in Vietnam, it will sail along its original route to Kobe, Japan, and then return to Shanghai.

### Implementation of Restrictions on Rice Exports

Previously, suggestions were made to suppress the current rice prices, firstly by improving the sources of rice both domestically and internationally, increasing rice reserves, and cracking down on illegal transactions; and secondly by preventing rice already transported to Shanghai from being re-exported to other areas, thereby increasing local reserves. The rice industry and the authorities of the two concessions had attached considerable importance to these suggestions. Now, the Public Works Department has issued a notice restricting the transportation of rice outside the concession areas, requiring prior acquisition of permits. It is also reported that the rice industry has received instructions from the authorities to implement these measures.

### Revision of US President Liner Schedule Due to Hurricane Season

The regular liners of the American President Lines have experienced delays in their original itineraries due to orders to evacuate American citizens from Hong Kong and the impact of typhoons encountered en route. The President Coolidge has been delayed until August 27th for its arrival in Shanghai from the United States, and it will set sail for Hong Kong and the Philippines on the 28th. The President Pierce, originally scheduled to depart the United States on the 29th, has also been rescheduled to depart Shanghai on September 1st. The President Taft has also been rescheduled to depart Shanghai for Japan, San Francisco, and Los Angeles on September 20th.

### Japanese Military Vehicle on Nanjing Road Allegedly Attacked with Stones

However, the Public Works Department has not reported that around 1:00 PM the day before yesterday, it was rumored that two Japanese military officers in uniform were riding in a car when someone suddenly threw stones at them in front of the Sincere Company on Nanjing Road, injuring the forehead of one officer. The stone thrower escaped in the crowded street. The Japanese side requested the police authorities to conduct an on-site investigation. Detective Hart of the detective department and Hollen once inspected the scene and it appeared to be true. It is reported that the Japanese side may lodge a protest with the Police Commissioner of the Public Works Department, Mr. Bowen. However, according to an official of the Police Department of the Public Works Department yesterday morning, the Police Department has not received any reports about the Japanese side claiming that an officer was injured in the car when the incident occurred.

### Sheng Sheng Ranch Manager Shen Jiucheng Abducted Yesterday - Bandits Ambushed and Drove Away in His Car - Rescue Efforts Outside the Concession Were Ineffective

An abduction occurred at the entrance of Youyi Village on Columbia Road in Shanghai at approximately 10:15 AM yesterday. The victim was Shen Jiucheng, the manager of the local Sheng Sheng Ranch. The kidnappers, numbering four, brandished firearms, forcing Shen's driver out of the car. The bandits jumped in and one of them drove off towards Anhua Temple Road, Hongqiao Road, and Lujia Road. The details of the abduction, as learned, are as follows:

Heading to the Factory for Business

Shen Jiucheng, 47 years old, a native of Cixi, Zhejiang, has resided at No. 9 Columbia Road in Shanghai for many years. He currently serves as the manager of Sheng Sheng Ranch at No. 174 Daxilu. Before the war, Shen was known for his skillful management and dedicated efforts, making the business very prosperous. He also established a branch at No. 200, Lane 541, Anhua Temple Road. At approximately 10:15 AM yesterday, Shen was riding in his own Ford car, license plate number 3735, driven by his Ningbo driver, Ying Zhonghui (who has been working for him for seven or eight years), heading towards the Anhua Temple Road branch for inspection.

Abducted En Route

When the car had not gone far, reaching the entrance of Youyi Village on the same road, a car suddenly blocked the road. The kidnappers, who had been lying in wait, shouted Shen's name. Seeing Shen's car approaching, two of the bandits immediately pulled out handguns, blocking the way. They first forced Shen's driver, Ying Zhonghui, out of the car. Ying, intimidated by their violence, had no choice but to obey. The bandits then jumped into the car, and one of them, acting as the driver, drove the car towards Anhua Temple Road, Hongqiao Road, and Lujia Road.

Unable to Pursue

After the incident, the driver, Ying Zhonghui, ran back home and reported to Shen's family. Shen's residence immediately pressed the police alarm. Upon hearing the alarm, the Jing'an Temple Road police station quickly dispatched a red patrol car to the scene to pursue the kidnappers. When they reached the vicinity of the barbed wire on Hongqiao Road, they vaguely saw what appeared to be Shen's car speeding away. However, because the area belonged to the occupied zone and there was a foreign military guard post nearby, it was inconvenient to cross the border to pursue them. They immediately returned to Shen's residence, brought the driver, Ying Zhonghui, back to the police station to question him about the abduction of his employer, in order to track down the kidnappers and bring them to justice.

Outward Strength, Inward Weakness

The reporter met with Mr. Ju of the ranch, who stated that the ranch had been established for over ten years and had a modest scale. Before the war, branches had been opened in Longhua, Xietu Road, Caohejing, and other places. A branch was also established in Zhuanqiao, on the Shanghai-Minhang Road, specializing in raising dairy cows. However, after August 13th, the above-mentioned areas became occupied zones. The ranch buildings were razed to the ground, and the ranch was almost completely destroyed by artillery fire. The losses suffered were incalculable. In addition, with the recent soaring prices and a slight increase in milk prices, sales have become sluggish, and the business has been greatly affected. The company's situation has become one of outward strength but inward weakness.

### Harana and Golden Set Sail Last Night to Explore Zhejiang Eastern Shipping Routes - Harana Sails to Gu'ao, Golden Sails to Songmen and Ganpu

The German Far East Company's Harana ship, continuing its trial voyage to Gu'ao Head, set sail last night at dusk. The Golden ship, also exploring Zhejiang eastern shipping routes, set sail from the Bund No. 4 wharf at 6:00 PM yesterday. The destination is Songmen, Ganpu, and nearby islands. Where the passengers will disembark will be determined after observing the situation in eastern Zhejiang. There is no confirmation yet whether the Moufu ship will also attempt to explore the routes.

Fujian Merchants Oppose Freight Rate Increase

Dozens of Fujian merchants in Shanghai, including Huang Fengji (representing the Fuzhou, Xinghua, and Quanzhou merchant guilds), opposed the doubling of the freight rate for the Fusheng Company's Xin'anna ship on its trial voyage to Fuqing. They convened a joint meeting at the Fujian Fellow Association yesterday. They resolved: "The shipping rates between Shanghai and Fujian have been increased several times by various companies, and we have reluctantly accepted them. The current doubling is unbearable. Moreover, with each ship's original return to Shanghai, the losses to Fujian merchants have been enormous. Therefore, we will not accept this further increase in freight rates and will announce to all Fujian merchants that those who ship goods to Fujian on this ship must calculate according to the original freight rates, otherwise the association will impose penalties." According to the Pingming News Agency's inquiry to the Fusheng Company, the doubling of the freight rate is imperative and unlikely to change.

### The Path of Three Hurricanes

According to the Observatory's report at 6:00 AM yesterday, regarding the three consecutive hurricanes in the Pacific, the first hurricane, after making landfall west of Hong Kong and heading towards western Guangdong, has dissipated. The second hurricane had reached 29 degrees North latitude, 127 degrees East longitude at 6:00 AM yesterday, slowly moving north. The center of the storm was within 60 nautical miles. There was no report on the path of the third hurricane as of 10:00 AM this morning.

### Ministry Orders Release of Fresh Eggs Shipped to Shanghai by Haening Foreign Firm

Regarding the ban on egg transport, the Shanghai office of the American firm Haening received a telegram from the American Consul General's office, which in turn had received a telegram from the Chongqing Embassy. The Ministry of Finance had sent a special telegram to the Zhejiang Provincial Government regarding this matter. The Chongqing telegram stated: "The Ministry of Finance's previous telegram to the Zhejiang Provincial Government regarding the ban on egg exports did not include fresh eggs. The Ministry of Finance has now sent a special telegram to the Zhejiang Provincial Government clarifying the situation and ordering the Zhejiang Provincial Government to allow the normal release of fresh eggs shipped to Shanghai by the American firm Haening from Ningbo."

### Designation of Native Goods Exempt from Transit Tax - Objections to Valuation Permitted - Tax-Exempt Goods Include Forty-Four Categories Such as Fresh Eggs

Since the promulgation of the Provisional Regulations on Customs Transit Tax, all goods manufactured or structured in the country from dutiable foreign raw materials, or foreign goods that have been adulterated or diluted after import, or whose original state has been altered by other means, shall be regarded as native goods and subject to transit tax upon transshipment. All manufactured goods sold domestically are entitled to the same treatment as ordinary native goods, i.e., manufactured goods transported to various parts of the country are subject to transit tax in the same way as similar ordinary native goods. These goods should also be subject to customs duty once, except for goods subject to consolidated tax. Now, in order to relieve the burden on merchants, the National Government has stipulated that forty-four categories of goods, such as fresh eggs, shall be exempt from transit tax. Other goods shall be subject to transit tax at a rate of several percent either ad valorem or per hundred.

Tax-Exempt Goods

Fresh eggs, honey, bones, shells, oyster shells, unnamed animal products, unnamed fish and seafood products, bran, buckwheat, unnamed miscellaneous grain flour, sorghum, corn, millet, rice, seed cakes, wheat, unnamed miscellaneous grains, unnamed vegetable dyes, fresh olives, bridges, unnamed fruits, garlic, large mustard, salted dried radish, unnamed dried and fresh bran vegetables, feed, unnamed plant products, unnamed bamboo products, charcoal, firewood, unnamed rattan products, waste cotton, waste silk, unnamed textile fibers, ropes and nets, drawnwork, drawnwork, embroidered products, lace ornaments, unnamed textiles, bricks and tiles, earthenware pottery, unnamed clay sand and stone and their products, unnamed chemicals and chemical products, unnamed printed matter, straw hats, whips, and straw hats, hair nets, hairpieces, straw mats, reed mats.

Objections Allowed

If an exporter is dissatisfied with the price or classification determined by the customs, he may lodge a written protest with the Commissioner of Customs within fourteen days from the date of issuance of the transit tax payment certificate, clearly stating the reasons for the objection. Pending resolution of the case, the merchant may submit a deposit and request that the goods be released first. The amount of the deposit must be sufficient to pay the full amount of tax due and other additional charges determined by the customs, but this procedure is limited to those approved by the customs. Within fifteen days of receiving the protest, the Commissioner of Customs shall review the case. If he still considers the merchant's protest to be invalid, he shall submit the case to the Director-General of Customs for verification. If the Director-General of Customs deems the handling of the case to be appropriate, he shall forward it to the Tariff Classification and Valuation Review Committee for final determination.

Tax Evasion and False Reporting

When the Tariff Classification and Valuation Review Committee meets, all questions concerning procedures, etc., shall be decided by a majority vote. These resolutions shall be implemented after being approved by the Directorate General of Customs. Regarding disputes over the price of goods, if the Tariff Classification and Valuation Review Committee determines that the actual price of the goods exceeds the price originally reported by the protester by 20% or more, the Customs may, in addition to collecting the correct tax due, order the protester to pay a penalty of ten times or less the amount of tax evaded. For goods whose prices are in dispute and have already been sold under contract, if the contract was not submitted for verification at the time of declaration, the contract will not be recognized as evidence of the price of the goods if it is later submitted to the Tariff Classification and Valuation Review Committee, and the protest will be considered invalid.

### Japanese Planes Disturb Xikou Again, Dropping Twenty-Four Bombs - Over One Hundred Houses Destroyed, Only One Death - Also Invading Ningbo and Strafing with Machine Guns

Four Japanese planes, taking off from the skies above Guanhaizi at 7:44 AM the previous morning, intruded into Ningbo for low-altitude reconnaissance and dropped many absurd leaflets. They then used machine guns to strafe, resulting in a civilian, He Shunli, from Baiheqiao in Jiangdong, being shot in the waist and falling to the ground injured. He was immediately rushed to the hospital by the air defense rescue team, and his life is expected to be saved.

Sneaking into Xikou

The group of Japanese planes then sneaked into Fenghua Xikou, dropping fifteen bombs, including incendiary bombs, causing fires in many places. After the Japanese planes wreaked havoc, they headed out to sea towards Longshan. At 12:30 PM, two more Japanese planes intruded into the skies over Xikou from Guanhaizi and dropped nine more bombs. They only left along their original route after 1:00 PM.

Bombing Locations

After investigation, it was found that the first time, the Japanese planes dropped fifteen bombs, landing near Wuling Mountain, Xikou Middle Street, the Wang Family Ancestral Hall, Wang Shihe's shop, Zhuyuan Lane on Shang Street, and Yangqiaotou. The second time, they dropped nine bombs, landing behind the Xikou Post Office, across from the Post Office, to the left of the Post Office, and in the fields nearby.

Japanese Warships Shell

A Japanese warship anchored in the waters off Hengshan shelled Shuangquan Port with three rounds at 8:05 AM.

### Daylight Robbery on Xinzha Road - Detectives Open Fire to Capture Robbers - One Robber Wounded, One Captured Alive - Three Lookouts Escape

The home of Fu Zhongshan, resident of No. 8 Renji Lane, Xinzha Road, was suddenly visited by five well-dressed robbers in Western suits at approximately 1:30 PM yesterday. Two of them carried handguns and entered the house to rob, while the other three stood guard at the entrance and in the lane. After the two robbers entered the house, they drove the homeowner's family and servants into a corner, then ransacked the boxes and cabinets, stealing cash and jewelry worth approximately one thousand several hundred yuan, which they put into bags.

Just About to Escape

Unexpectedly, a resident of a neighboring house noticed that Fu's house had been robbed and secretly called the Xinzha Police Station. Upon receiving the report, the police station immediately dispatched Chinese detective Yang Yunfeng along with several Chinese and Western detectives, driving a patrol car to arrest the robbers. The three robbers who were standing guard in the lane saw the armed detectives arriving and knew that something was wrong, so they quietly escaped. When

The Detectives Swarmed In

The two robbers inside the house also turned around and attempted to escape upstairs. The detectives drew their guns and ordered them to stop from behind. One of the robbers dropped his handgun and surrendered. The other robber climbed onto the wall of a neighboring house from the roof, intending to jump down. The detectives fired a shot, wounding the robber in the leg, and were able to capture him. They also found all the stolen goods near the two robbers, then summoned an ambulance to take the wounded robber to the police hospital for treatment. Because

The Injuries Were Severe

He was unable to speak, so it was impossible to interrogate him. The other captured robber was tall and sturdy, and dressed in fashionable Western clothing. After being taken back to the police station for questioning, he identified himself as Gao Shunfa, also known as Guo Shunfa, and admitted to conspiring with the gang to commit armed robbery. He is currently detained at the police station, awaiting transfer to the court for prosecution.

### Sudden Search by Japanese on Haining Road - Forty-Nine Gamblers Arrested - Over 4,000 Yuan in Legal Tender Confiscated

At approximately 2:00 PM the day before yesterday, a team of judicial police from the Japanese Consulate suddenly rushed to the residence of Yan Zhao at No. 49, Lane 2, Dexing Lane, Haining Road. One part of the team guarded the entrances and exits, and another part broke into the house. At that time, those in the residence were engrossed in gambling. This unexpected intrusion startled everyone. Forty-nine gamblers (including seven women) and Mori Tsumori, a Japanese man who was the "Supervisor of the Shanghai Rickshaw Association" on Dongjiaxing Road, were arrested on the spot, and all gambling funds of over 4,000 yuan on the table were confiscated.

### Unemployed Youth - Commits Suicide Out of Shame and Anger

Zhu Shende, a Ningbo native residing at No. 11, Rue Paul Beau, French Concession, is 26 years old and unmarried. He has been unemployed for five or six years. He relies on his elderly father, Zhu Zihui (64 years old), who works as a merchant outside, for financial support. Recently, due to the high cost of living, his father's monthly income was not enough to cover household expenses, causing financial difficulties. His father scolded him for not finding a way to make a living outside and for sitting at home doing nothing. As a result, father and son had an argument. Shende felt ashamed that he could not run a business to support his elderly father, but instead relied on his father to work hard outside to make a living. After thinking it over, he suddenly had a suicidal thought. At 4:00 PM on the 23rd, while his father was out, he swallowed poisonous liquid to commit suicide. When his father returned home at night and discovered what had happened, he reported it to the police and sent him to Guangci Hospital. However, the poison had already taken effect, and he died at 3:00 AM that night despite treatment.

### Enticing Women From Good Families - Forcing Them Into Prostitution - Three Female Victims Rescued - Procuress Chen Liu Arrested for Investigation

Chen Liu, a Yangzhou woman residing at No. 8, Lane 51, Guling Road, specialized in enticing women from good families and forcing them into prostitution. Recently, Li Cuiying (father named Wang Jinmei, 19 years old), a Changshu girl raised by Chen, could not bear the abuse and secretly informed the detective department of the Zhabei Police Station. Western detective Fang Tewahua (badge number 31013) went to the address, arrested Chen, and rescued Li Cuiying and another 18-year-old Yangzhou woman, Li Guiying (also known as Chen Guiying or Li Xiuzhen). Later, they went to No. 9 Avenue Haig, French Concession, and rescued Wu A'mei (also known as Sun Lingdi), a 14-year-old girl from Danyang. They also seized six contracts of sale, which clearly proved that Chen Liu was in the business of enticing women from good families and forcing them into prostitution as a regular occupation. She was handed over to the Second Criminal Court of the Special District Court yesterday morning. Police lawyer Li Zhishan prosecuted her according to Article 231, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. After questioning by Judge Chuan Lin, she was ordered to be detained for further interrogation at a later date.

### Divorced Woman Accuses Ex-Husband of Joint Embezzlement - Hu Jinli Absconds with the Money

Xu Fulong, 37 years old, a native of Yancheng, residing at No. 47 Baixiang Village, Rue de la Mission, is the owner of the Pingjin Sanhelou restaurant opposite the Great World on Min'ti'ni Road. In 1926, he married Xu Jiang (38 years old, nicknamed "Thirteen O'Clock", also known as "Crazy Three"), a woman from Yangzhou. The relationship was relatively harmonious after the marriage, but they did not have any children. In recent years, Jiang's attitude suddenly changed. She frequently visited entertainment venues, and met Xu Haishan (42 years old), a truck driver from Yancheng, at the Great World. She then rented a house and lived with him at No. 462, Route des Soeurs. It was not until January 27th of this year that Xu Fulong found out about it. He reported it to the French police, who dispatched detectives to arrest Xu Jiang and Xu Haishan, and sent them to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Special District Court. Judge Wu Kechou sentenced each of them to four months' imprisonment. Xu Fulong also filed a divorce suit against Jiang in the Civil Court of the same court. Judge Yu Changzi presided over the seventh civil court to mediate a settlement. A settlement was reached in court, with Xu Fulong paying a separation fee of 800 yuan. Jiang designated her nephew-in-law, Hu Jinli, to collect the money on her behalf. A written agreement was made on March 16th, with Hu collecting the 800 yuan. However, after receiving the money, Hu did not hand it over to Jiang, but fled to Hongkou. Recently, Jiang hired a lawyer to file a complaint with the Criminal Court of the Special District Court, accusing Xu Fulong and Hu Jinli of colluding to embezzle the money, violating Article 335 of the Criminal Law. The court accepted the complaint, and Judge Tang Jia-hua presided over the second criminal court to hear the case yesterday morning. Xu Fulong commissioned lawyer Xu Wufang to appear in court to defend him, claiming that after the civil court settlement, the plaintiff instructed to hand the money to Hu, and the money and receipt were exchanged on March 16th, so it was actually unrelated to the defendant and Hu Jinli should be pursued separately. Hu Jinli did not appear despite being summoned by the court. The court ordered that the case be adjourned for further hearing, and Hu Jinli's address was unknown, so a public notice was served.

### A Grand Spectacle of Tennis Exhibition; Extremely Exciting Match; Carson and Little Hsu Lost in Doubles, Lin and Wang Take the Lead; British Consul-General George Attends and Delivers a Thank You Speech

The Shanghai Race Club hosted a performance by Chinese and Western tennis masters yesterday afternoon at 4:30 in front of the grandstand at the Race Course to raise funds for the British War Relief Fund. The performance was extremely exciting, and the audience was unprecedentedly large, with two to three thousand Chinese and Westerners in attendance. In the middle of the match, the British Westforth Military Band played famous songs, which was also a farewell performance for the band. Finally, British Consul-General George gave a speech, thanking all parties. It was a pity that the match could not be completed due to a sudden autumn rain. The performance was the most exciting seen in Shanghai recently. Carson flew back from Japan to participate. Hsu Cheng-wei's backhand shot in the first singles match was quite skillful, hitting the mark repeatedly, but his net play and stamina were not as good as Carson's. The two young boys, Li and Liang, in the second doubles match showed remarkable progress. They came back from 2-4 to win 7-5. Stokes made many mistakes. The final doubles match was the highlight, with Wang Wenzheng and Lin directly defeating Qiu Feihai of that year. They took an extremely advantageous lead in the first set with 4-1, and then won 6-2 very easily. They won three consecutive games in the third set before the heavy rain stopped the match. Based on Lin and Wang's performance yesterday, they are likely to win the Robber Cup.

### This City Orders the Academic Calendar for Primary and Secondary Schools in the 29th Year of the Republic (1)

(Dahua News Agency) The annual academic calendar for primary and secondary schools in this city was originally announced and implemented by the Municipal Social Bureau. After the westward movement of the Chinese army and the retreat of the government, each school formulated its own academic calendar, resulting in a lack of uniformity across the city, which is a major regret.

### Returning from Gambling, Tasting the Flavor of Detention, More Than Seventy People Detained Overnight, The Public Rental Office Intensifies Enforcement of Curfew

According to the English Greater America Evening News, between 12:30 am and 5:00 am yesterday, more than 70 Chinese, including 7 women, were detained at the Jing'an Temple Patrol Room for violating the curfew. In addition, 16 cars, some of which were private cars, were also detained at the Patrol Room for violating the curfew. They were only released at 7:00 am yesterday. Most of the detained Chinese were caught entering the Public Concession from various gambling houses in West Shanghai in chartered cars. It is believed that the Public Concession Police Department, in view of the British army's withdrawal from West Shanghai, has intensified the strict enforcement of the curfew in that area during this period. It is reported that the reason why the Police Department has taken this strict measure is to eliminate the intrusion of gambling crimes in the western district into the Public Concession.

### The Growth of American Literature and Art

In this year, where is there still a paradise? It is either a series of wars or frequent disasters. The Americans, uniquely blessed by nature, rely on the three major elements of favorable weather, geography, and human harmony, and still live a life of good weather, prosperity, and peace. Under the extremely democratic spirit, various forms of literature and art are nurtured and grown without end, creating a new garden of American culture.

What deserves to be called literature and art? National history, social customs, and the real environment, all these reasons cannot be ignored. The Americans, however, honestly use the extremely realistic life and the extremely democratic spirit to set their literary and artistic standards. Their literature and art is alive, dynamic, universal, popular, and under the current situation, it is progressing very quickly. Now, let's not discuss the standards of American literature and art, but only describe the recent development situation as follows:

Radio broadcasting music is all the rage. The symphony orchestras conducted by the famous musician Toscanini every week have as many as 4.5 million listeners. Walter Dan Roshi broadcasts music on NBC radio, and the number of listeners every week is as high as several million. If it were not for the popularity of radio broadcasting, where would there be such a wide audience to appreciate this kind of noble music? The popularization of this kind of music has only been in the past fifteen years. As for schools, there are already more than 35,000 music teams.

The atmosphere of reading books, newspapers and magazines is now far better than before. The works of writers have improved in terms of ideas, materials and writing style. Fifty years ago, the sales volume of any magazine in the United States never exceeded one million copies. Now there are 26 kinds of magazines with sales volumes exceeding one million copies. Famous magazines have a strong literary flavor, but they can have such a large number of readers. This cannot but be said to be the progress of American readers.

Let's look at art again. Famous magazines like Life have begun to use color to exquisitely print ancient and modern famous paintings. Secondly, the famous painting collection A Treasury of Art Masterpieces is priced at ten US dollars, and its sales volume still surpasses other books. The reproduced masterpieces for home decoration are also in short supply. People are flocking to museums and art galleries to study fine arts. The Picasso exhibition held in the New York Museum of Modern Art attracted nearly 100,000 visitors in 50 days. The Italian painting exhibition attracted more than 277,000 visitors in 73 days, which are all amazing records.

The number of people studying in society has increased tenfold compared to 1900. Millions of Americans hope that their children will receive higher education. Enthusiasts who sponsor education and scientific research donate millions of dollars to raise teaching standards. Now, diligent students and young people with scientific talent can get considerable assistance and develop their strengths. The government and the public are also more eager to help artists than before.

The so-called eighth art, the film industry, after a long time of avoiding substantive descriptions, now also has signs of progress, and films based on research and facts are attracting attention. Disney's cartoons are especially unprecedented.

The public's enthusiasm for photography is also a sign of their love for art. Hundreds of thousands of men and women, young and old, can be seen everywhere taking pictures with cameras. After the film is taken, it is developed in the darkroom at home, which fully demonstrates the spirit of amateurs.

If you drive out in a car, you can see engineers and architects working together to plan and create beautiful buildings in the suburbs, and new-style houses of the 20th century stand tall on both sides of the road. New-style bridges and water gates are both practical and beautiful. Just look at the Washington Bridge and the Texaco gas depot. How majestic and moving they are. These are the masterpieces of American unique talent.

In the New York World's Fair, the rainbow-like colored electric light is also a great spectacle in optics and electrical engineering. This is the beginning of the art of light, and there will be more advanced works in the future.

The application of color is now greatly improved. The kitchens in homes, even the machines in factories, and the glassware bought in department stores seem to be made for pleasing the eye, and they are arranged that way. The appearance and packaging of things purchased from stores have also been greatly changed from before, with beauty and convenience as the main goals. Gradually, everyone knows that daily necessities can be beautified, and many people love to use beautiful things.

### Quezon, the First President of the Philippines

— Shou Shan

Quezon, the first president of the Philippines, is full of rubber-like elasticity and lightning-like alertness, and can be regarded as a "veteran" among the world's dictators. He is short in stature, fashionable in dress, wears his hat tilted to the most fashionable angle, and loves pleasure no less than power. He is a very shrewd poker gambler and also a dance expert.

But he is by no means just a playboy, but one of the most shrewd politicians in the world. He is as enthusiastic about patriotism as he is about self-love. The history of the Philippines in the 20th century is inseparable from Quezon's biography.

He was born in a small town on Luzon Island and is now 62 years old. His father was a school principal. His half-Spanish mother was a teacher. When he was young, he was smart but lazy. He went to university to study law, but dropped out in 1898 when the Philippine Revolution broke out against Spanish rule.

Most of the 14 million Filipinos love comfort, but in order to resist the oppression of the Spanish, they unanimously launched a great revolutionary struggle under the leadership of the patriotic leader Aguinaldo. At this time, the United States also declared war on Spain, and the revolutionary army won victories. After the United States defeated Spain, it took over the Philippine Islands, and Aguinaldo resisted the United States until he was captured by the US military in 1901.

Quezon then continued to resist the American army, and his anger at the failure of the resistance can be imagined. Therefore, he refused to learn English for many years. Later, he worked as a lawyer in a province of the Philippines, earning about 500 US dollars a month, but he soon gave it up and changed to a prosecutor for 75 yuan a month. He dared to accuse a famous American lawyer of fraud, and thus became famous throughout the country. Before 1904, the Philippines had never heard of a Filipino accusing an American. In 1908, when he was 30 years old, he became a leader of the Philippine Assembly and the Philippine Islands.

In the next 25 years, he continued to engage in the independence movement. He served as the Philippine representative in Washington for eight years, and after returning to China, he was elected Speaker of the Philippine Senate. In 1934, the US Congress passed the Tydings-McDuffie Act, and the Philippines became an autonomous republic, and it was stipulated that it would be completely independent by 1946. Quezon was elected as the first president.

Although he is over 60 years old, he still works tirelessly every day. He usually gets up at dawn and likes to receive guests at breakfast. He meets guests very informally, often wearing a sports shirt and opening his collar.

During the week, he would make two or three unexpected inspections of the police station, prison, tobacco factory, or any department of the government. He likes to listen to people complaining, and sometimes he even eats with the workers. If a political prisoner is arrested, he often talks to him in person.

He likes to do things quickly. He decided in five minutes to invite former US Chief of Staff MacArthur to Manila as a military advisor. He asked MacArthur, "I only ask you to answer one question: Can the Philippines be defended?" MacArthur replied, "Yes," and he gave MacArthur full authority.

He is not rich, and the rumors outside are absolutely unreliable. His annual salary is only 15,000 yuan, and he himself is very fond of extravagance.

The wife he loves the most is his first cousin, beautiful and talented, and a Catholic.

Quezon is proficient in English, Spanish, and Tagalog, and can speak in three languages. He used to devote himself to the Philippine independence movement, but now he is not sure whether independence is necessary.

General MacArthur and the Philippine General Staff both believe that the Philippines can defend itself. They all believe that air attacks on the Philippine Islands will not be effective, and infantry invasions are even more impossible. The Philippine army trains 40,000 new recruits every year and can become a strong force. However, the Philippines lacks the industrial equipment necessary for modern warfare, and it does not have a fleet to resist the Japanese navy.

Politically, the Philippines is at least in theory a progressive democratic country, but economically it still maintains the conditions of the feudal era. This is the legacy of Spanish rule. Industry is mostly controlled by a small number of Spanish aristocrats, and most of the land is also controlled by large landlords or churches. The real farmers cannot even make ends meet.

Quezon has cautiously begun to implement the division of large landowners. But his situation is roughly the same as that of President Roosevelt. If President Roosevelt wants to attack Wall Street, but 70% of his supporters are from Wall Street. Quezon knows that if he wants to truly reform, he must first destroy the feudal system - that is, the Catholic Church. But doing so would undoubtedly destroy himself.

Quezon's opposition is very weak. There is not a single member of parliament who opposes him. All those who oppose him also respect him as the father of the Philippines. What they complain about is nothing more than saying that he is a dictator.

### British Air Defense Weapons

In the past two months, the air war between Britain and Germany has intensified. German planes are superior in quantity, while British planes are superior in quality. The mainstay of British air defense is superior fighter planes and high-speed destroyers. Secondly, there are anti-aircraft guns and anti-aircraft machine gun teams. In addition, there are the following two types:

One is the "Ashbos-style flying fortress." Ashbos is a Hungarian, a famous designer of vertical take-off and landing aircraft. He used to work at the Austrian Aviation Research Institute, and then served in Germany, assisting General Goering in expanding the air force. Not long before the outbreak of the European war, he changed to helping Britain. Each of his designed vertical take-off and landing aircraft has 2,000 horsepower, is equipped with heavy armor, and is equipped with rapid-firing machine guns, which can kill enemy dive bombers. This new type of aircraft is the so-called "flying fortress." It can take off and land vertically without a large airfield. Moreover, even if the parts are accidentally damaged, it can land safely. After taking off, it is extremely agile in intercepting enemy aircraft; at the same time, because of its stable flight, it is easier for machine gunners to aim. Because of these advantages, it is most suitable for defending densely populated areas. The "flying fortress" made according to his design can be used as a fighter in small sizes, and as a transport plane in large sizes, each carrying 50 people. On the other hand, because it can hover and aim in the air, it can also become the best bomber. Now a small number of these aircraft have been built and will be used to protect the skies over London.

The second is the aerial minefield. This device for defending against enemy air raids is a recent invention. Its setup is to raise hundreds of balloons, each five feet in diameter, into the air to a height of about 30,000 feet, each balloon attached to a small bomb with a 40-foot-long line. If an enemy plane hits a bomb, it will definitely be greatly damaged or even crash to the ground. It is said that it only takes two people to release one in 30 minutes, and they can be adjusted to float at any predetermined height. The manufacturing cost of aerial mines is very low, so they can be used in large quantities to defend cities and military targets. Another type that uses balloons is called "anti-aircraft balloons." The main function of this anti-aircraft balloon is the large iron cable it tows. After the balloon rises, the iron cable is pulled tight, and if an aircraft hits the iron cable, it can immediately be shattered. With this equipment in the air, it forces the attacking aircraft to not be able to perform dive bombing or low-flying strafing. As for the position of each balloon, it is scientifically distributed; the placement position also needs to be changed frequently to confuse the enemy aircraft. Its release is under a strict and witty command, just like commanding an army to fight. The height of ascent is also determined by the commander based on the situation. After such an aerial Bagua formation is formed, it is not easy for enemy aircraft to enter and exit this iron cable circle. According to the report of Secretary of War Eden, this type of anti-aircraft balloon has captured several German aircraft, which shows its effectiveness.

Finally, there is a newly invented "predictor." It can predict when an enemy aircraft will fly to a certain point, so that anti-aircraft guns can accurately hit it, or send a fleet of aircraft to intercept it. There is also a type called "mobile searchlight" that can illuminate an aircraft as it flies overhead, so that it cannot hide at all.

Old News Re-copied Sixty-Seven Years Ago (486) (See the Twelfth Year of Tongzhi of the Late Qing Dynasty)
— The Sanjiang Literary School

Regarding the writing style of the imperial examination, predecessors all discussed it in terms of trends, truly the words of Chu! The eight-legged essay is different from policy essays, memorials, poems, and fu, etc., in that it must have a certain scope. Even if one boasts of talent and displays temperament, one still follows the rules. Therefore, those who learn it are like women tracing flower patterns. From childhood to adulthood, there is a time for improvement in skill, but the method never changes. Since it is like a flower pattern, then it can be changed and innovated endlessly. When it is popular, thousands of people imitate it. If it is not successful, then it is not in style. Since the establishment of the imperial examination system at the beginning of the Ming Dynasty, the first examination tested four-book essays in seven sections, now changed to three sections. The essays of the early Ming Dynasty were plain and bland. In the sections, there were several sentences that tightly grasped the whole topic and elaborated on its meaning, which were considered masterpieces. By the Chenghua, Hongzhi, Zhengde, and Jiajing periods, it had changed slightly. The tightly refined parts gradually increased, the concluding sentences were solemn, and the conception was difficult. It was a transition from simplicity to magnificence. Then in the Longqing and Wanli periods, it changed again; in the Tianqi and Chongzhen periods, it changed again. Generally speaking, magnificence was slightly embellished, and the skill was further advanced. By the early Qing Dynasty, it was considered the most prosperous period, with writing style and substance complementing each other, and both the virtual and the real being present. The structure also gradually became new and beautiful. By the Yongzheng and Qianlong periods, it was pure and refined, broad and prosperous, even and balanced. The mastery of current affairs essays reached its peak at this point. Then, when things reached their extreme, they changed. After purity, novelty was occasionally added. From then on, it went downhill, avoiding the common and familiar in the questions, and cutting off without reason; using novelty in the writing, and adding unnecessary details. The paired style was gradually abandoned; the erudite words were generally deleted.

Children's Weekly

### A Contribution to Children Who Are About to Start School

— Wen

Children! In this turbulent era, our schools are about to start again. Before school starts, let's review whether our vacation life has been meaningful, whether our bodies and studies have improved, and how much progress we have made in our vacation homework. At the same time, we must think that there are tens of thousands of children across the country who do not have the opportunity to study, and there are also many studious children who have lost their schooling due to the closure of summer tutoring schools. We can still go to school and study, but we are not forced, and we do not strive forward. Isn't this shameful?

When the semester starts, children will meet again, and there will inevitably be a lot of excitement and joy. However, they do not know that the tuition fees for this semester have also increased due to rising prices, and how anxiously their parents are planning. In addition, children are unwilling to take care of their belongings. In addition to buying new books, they also have to add school supplies, but these items have all risen in price. Even the worst five-cent notebooks cost more than one yuan a dozen. Therefore, parents have added burdens. If children do not know how to cherish and save, it will be too late to regret when they are unable to buy.

The following is a brief explanation of how to save on school supplies:

1.  Schoolbag: It is best to make it yourself, because if you buy it on the market, they will add labor costs to the fabric price, so it is extra expensive. When you make it yourself, you only need a piece of cloth, and you can make various styles as you like. If you like beauty, you can embroider flowers or paste cloth on the corners of the bag. Fabrics such as bamboo cloth and twill cloth that are not easily soiled, such as dark-colored shilin cloth, are much more durable than those bought.

2.  Books: The paper in the books that children read is very thin. If they are not taken care of, they will be damaged in a few days. Therefore, after we buy new books, we immediately wrap them with book covers, replacing them as they break. At the same time, we should not scribble on the books, and place them flat in a fixed place after reading. In this way, our books will still be new when the semester is over.

3.  Pencil: It should not be written too sharp and long. If it is too sharp and long, it is easy to break off and is not durable.

4.  Paper: Children should get rid of the habit of changing paper. When we start writing, we should have the idea of writing well. Sometimes we accidentally make a mistake, we mark it as invalid next to it and supervise ourselves not to change a single piece of paper. Later, we will naturally write well.

Schoolbags, books, pencils, and paper are the main items of school supplies. I have briefly described some saving methods. Other things like erasers and blades should also be cherished. I offer these little ideas to children who are starting or have not started school, hoping that you will earnestly implement them.

### A Word to Teachers on Organizing Summer Homework

— Yu Yu

Children are children after all. It is not easy to have perseverance in whatever they do. If you want children's work to be successful, it all depends on the patient guidance of the teachers. Now that the summer vacation is coming to an end and schools are about to start, I would like to offer a suggestion to the teachers for the summer homework competition. In the first week after school starts, focus on organizing summer homework. If you find children who have not finished their homework, encourage them to complete it as soon as possible. First, hold a competition for the number of summer homework submissions in each grade. Give a model class banner to the grade with the most submissions. This is an easy task to do. Using children's competitive psychology to complete summer homework has many benefits and no harm. Secondly, hold an exhibition of summer homework test papers from each grade in the school. Invite parents to the school to visit to show the school's seriousness about summer homework. This is a good way to gain the trust of parents. Of course, the best way is to not only exhibit summer homework, but also to judge it. The school should give some rewards to those with excellent results. This is also a way to be generous without spending much. Then, collect them and send them to the head office of this newspaper before September 15. The competition for the number of submissions and the achievement exhibition can all be designed as connected units. Leaving aside the inherent value of the summer homework competition, these matters alone have considerable educational effects. I believe that the teachers have already thought of and planned for this.

### Bombardment

— Su Ming

The news reported the other day that "The southern coast of England was bombarded by German long-range artillery. The top floors of two private houses were bombed and collapsed. Shrapnel rained down on the roofs of nearby houses. Windows within a half-mile radius were shattered..." This news caught the eye of Yong'er, but it aroused his attention.

"The German artillery on the French coast can actually bombard the English border. Modern military weapons are truly becoming more and more sophisticated. I wonder how huge this artillery is." After reading the news, he thought blankly. He also told his father about the news and asked him to talk about the general situation of this artillery. At this time, his brother Zong'er also came over.

"This long-range artillery was invented by the German Army General Staff in 1918, the year when the First World War in Europe was about to end. The motivation for the invention was that the air forces of Britain and France were very active, and Germany's air raids on various places were ineffective. Therefore, they came up with a method of using artillery to bombard the French capital, Paris. This was just an ideal. Who knew that the ideal would actually become a reality and was accidentally discovered by the German artillery. The caliber of the artillery was very large, and the angle between the artillery body and the ground was also very large, almost standing the artillery body upright on the ground. In this way, the height of the shell fired was more than twice that of ordinary artillery, that is, the shell was rapidly fired straight into the sky. Therefore, in the summer of 1918, Paris was bombarded by more than 300 shells. The structure of this artillery was kept secret by Germany and not made public. Later, I don't know how it was publicly announced: the weight of the artillery was 750 tons, and the artillery tube was a thick steel tube, more than one meter thick and three or four meters long. The shell was also more than one meter long and weighed about 300 pounds. The shell contained 400 pounds of gunpowder, so when a shell was fired, the explosive force of the shell had about 70,000 pounds of pressure, plus the weight of the shell, it was unimaginable. Since the shell was so heavy, how could it be fired to such a long distance? The artillery used mechanical force to make an appropriate angle with the ground, and then fired the shell. The speed at the moment it left the muzzle reached 2,000 meters per second. At this time, the air resistance also increased, but it could not resist the force of the shell. This fast speed was to make the shell reach a very high altitude layer, where the air was thin and the resistance was reduced, so that the shell could be fired to a very long distance, and then the shell fell rapidly and exploded at the destination. As for how to hit the destination, military experts made precise calculations beforehand. This was only more than 20 years ago. In modern times, almost every country has long-range artillery, and it is much more precise than before."

### Shirley Temple's Autobiography (13)

— Min

At first, our bodies were only 36 inches tall, but now we are gradually growing taller. I personally have grown to 40 inches, and other children are even taller than me. At this height, it is really unreasonable to be babies anymore, so our set of "Baby Take a Bow" films ended like this. I said goodbye to those children as if I was reluctant to leave. We had worked together for more than a year, loved each other, and became good friends, and we often played together.

There was a little girl who I liked the most. I spent the most time with her. Whenever I was filming, she was always with me. Before, I filmed "Stand Up and Cheer!", "Little Miss Marker", and "The Littlest Rebel". She never missed a single one. I think it will be the same when I film other films in the future. Coco, do you know why? Because she is my stand-in.

Now let me tell you what a stand-in is. Originally, her figure was the same as mine, and the clothes she wore were the same as the clothes I wore in the film. She and I were like a pair of twin sisters, but the faces did not have to be exactly the same. As for what this stand-in does, I also have to tell you clearly. Originally, I didn't understand this matter, but my good friend Jamie Dunn told me. Whenever I was about to film a scene, the cameramen, soundmen, and lighting men had to test it in advance. The cameraman wanted the lead actor to sit in the designated place so that he could calibrate the lens and avoid the problem of inaccurate lenses in a hurry. The soundmen and lighting men also wanted you to sit in the designated place to do some preliminary work.

But the lead actor is often very busy before officially appearing in front of the camera and doesn't have time to sit there and let them test. She has to comb her hair, tidy up her clothes, or practice new dance steps and sing new songs in the dressing room, which are all needed in this new film. However, even if you don't have time, the cameramen still have to test it, so they have to find a stand-in to represent everything. But as I see it, this is also a very hard job, because the testing time is very long, you often sit still and can't move, and the hot lights are always shining on you, almost making you unable to open your eyes.

### A Letter Discussing Writing (Part 1)

— He Ren

Hua Di, Ming Mei:

I had just received your letter when I heard the air raid siren. I hurriedly put your letter in my bag, took some important things, and hid in the air raid shelter. I barely finished reading your letter by the dim light. In today's China, it is such a rare and special opportunity for you to be able to talk about books and write at home in peace. Don't let it go lightly. You should work harder and forge ahead so as not to disappoint the thousands upon thousands of people who are risking their lives and fighting desperately. — You must always remember that they are risking their lives and fighting desperately for you! Enough of the idle talk, let's get down to business. — You are particularly happy to write during the summer vacation, so you specially wrote a letter to discuss the practice methods with me. However, you asked: What is the most effective way to practice? This is a bit difficult to answer. Even if the method is good, whether it is effective or not depends on your own efforts. One of the subjects I am currently studying is how to teach elementary school students. One part of it is about "how to teach elementary school students to practice writing." Now I will write out what I have learned from reading, which can be used as a reference for you:

(1) First, you must write correctly, neatly, and quickly. The most important thing for elementary school students to practice writing is to pay attention to practicality. The first step is to write each character correctly, without adding a stroke or omitting a stroke, and without inverting the shape. The second step is to write each line neatly and straight. The third step is not only to write clearly, so that it can be recognized at a glance, but also to look pleasing to the eye. However, in the modern world, things must be done quickly, and writing must of course be done quickly.

(2) You don't necessarily have to copy calligraphic models all the time when practicing writing. When we mention practicing writing, we think of copying calligraphic models. In fact, why do elementary school students have to copy calligraphic models? For example, the elementary textbooks you read when you were young have very good regular script characters on them. You can copy them, making use of waste and killing two birds with one stone. Also, there are many letters and notes written by adults, advertisements on the street and in schools, advertisements in newspapers, etc., many of which have very good handwriting. As long as you pay attention everywhere, there will be no shortage of materials for practice.

### A Record of Miss Li Xiaqing's Visit to the United States

— Qinghui

Co-starring in "Air Combat Competition" for Another Purpose

Aspiring to Develop Aviation, Not Interested in the Silver Screen

This article is a record of an interview with Miss Li Xiaqing by Ms. Liang Mamei (Mannie Louise Leung), a female Chinese reporter in the United States. Ms. Liang often writes for major newspapers in the United States and enjoys a high reputation. It is now excerpted and translated by Mr. Qinghui for the readers. (Editor)

It was a clear morning. Miss Xiaqing, in her morning dress, had her hair curled up around her head in a semi-circular shape. She wore a grey-green dress with light red flowers, topped with a light green shawl, making her look extremely exquisite. Her skin was very delicate, her mouth was like a ripe cherry, her face was oval-shaped, her eyebrows were curved, and her body was tall. At first glance, she was a typical Cantonese woman.

After I introduced myself, she smiled and invited me in. The furnishings in the room were purely Western-style. While she removed the newspaper from the sofa, she repeatedly offered me a seat. It seemed to be her comfortable home, both peaceful and gentle.

After she settled down, she waited for the guest to ask questions, her eyes twinkling, revealing that she was a smart and courageous woman.

So I asked her about her memories of being in film as a child, how many places she had been to, where she had learned aviation, how many years she had lived abroad, whether she had recently been writing, and her future hopes, etc...

The following is her answer.

"Speaking of my appearance on the screen, I am no longer very interested. At that time, my stage name was "Li Dandan," but after wandering around Europe and the United States for a few years, I abandoned the stage name "Dandan" and changed to my current name. Therefore, my film career is simply not worth recalling.

"I lived in Europe for four years and in the United States for one year. I studied aviation in Switzerland for four years. Because Switzerland and France are neighbors, I often went to France as well. I have been to most places in Europe and the United States that have air routes.

"Regarding writing, I am ashamed to say that I have only written one book in my life, "The Romance of Airways in China." The content of this book is dedicated to everything about aviation, my own experience in aviation, and the necessity of promoting the development of aviation. If time permits, I would also like to write a "Flying Across America" book recently. Maybe you think I am too daring!

"As for my future hopes, I want to fly to every corner of the world. This will not only truly develop what I have learned and fulfill my past aspirations, but also greatly promote China's aviation industry. Not only that, but I also hope to work hard for the aviation industry for the rest of my life, and I hope that every Chinese person will have rich aviation knowledge and increase the strength of national defense.

Finally, I asked her if she had any intention of continuing to make films in Hollywood? She suddenly blushed and was unhappy, as if she had been greatly insulted. She said: "My decision to co-star with Miss Dolores Lamour in "Disputed Passage" is on the one hand to promote aviation, and on the other hand to send the proceeds from filming back to the motherland as donations. I have no intention of appearing on the screen again. After that, I will continue to raise funds until the victory of the war of resistance for national reconstruction is achieved."

### Actors' Private Lives Need to be Taken Seriously

In order to promote newcomers, the National Drama Association recruited more than 20 male and female trainees two months ago, hoping that they would work hard to study during the training period and then be given acting opportunities. Unexpectedly, a small number of them thought that once they were admitted, they would be stars, and they did not study hard. Instead, they went in and out of song and dance halls all day long, giving people a bad impression. It is heard that the National Drama Association authorities believe that these few people are really unteachable and will be fired. A reporter from the Hai Xing News Agency asked Mr. Han Langen, the director of the National Drama Association, about this yesterday. He said that the authorities may handle it this way, but it is not completely decided yet. The reporter believes that the private lives of film actors really need to be taken seriously. Those who cannot repent and start anew, even if they have genius acting skills, it is not a pity to abandon them.

Chapter 5 Bad News

He added, "I've also sent a telegram to the Suzhou Police Department to investigate Li Shouqi's whereabouts."

I asked in surprise, "Li Shouqi? Who is he?"

"He's Li Zhiban's son, the deceased's cousin. He came to Shanghai on the seventeenth, stayed at Lilan's house for one night, and returned to Suzhou early on the eighteenth. According to Mr. Huo, this person may also have some relationship with the deceased. Therefore, when I was leaving, I asked the old man, and he said that his son was a teacher at the Suzhou Nursery School, so I sent a telegram to ask. If he really arrived in Suzhou during the day on the eighteenth, then we can reduce a suspect, and we can concentrate our attention during the investigation without being too distracted." He paused, and added, "In my opinion, the suspicions against this Mr. Yu and Mr. Zhao are very strong. There is really no need to be distracted by other people."

I nodded. "I agree with that. Is there any other information?"

Ni Jinying said, "Officer No. 202 was assigned to the Datong Road post from 11 p.m. to 2 a.m. last night. According to his report, at around 12 o'clock last night, there was indeed a black car parked on Datong Road near the corner of Qingpu Road."

I couldn't help but interrupt and say, "In that case, Old Mao's words were really true."

Ni Jinshou replied, "Yes, No. 202 also saw another car at the same time, parked on the west side of the open space on Qingpu Road, only three or four doors away from No. 27. I think this car is also related."

I hurriedly replied, "Of course. Did he pay attention to the license plate number?"

Ni Jinshou said, "No, but that green-cornered car looks like a taxi. It's not difficult to investigate. I've also sent people to investigate in this area." (86)
