### Unable to Invade Chinese Army, Japanese Army May Shorten Front, Chinese Armies Preparing for Large-Scale Counter-Offensive

Chongqing: Well-informed Chinese sources here, based on front-line news from North China, Central China, and South China, assert that in the near future, the Japanese army in any part of China will not launch a large-scale offensive. It is reported that the Japanese army on all fronts has indicated a shortening of the戰钱 (zhàn qián, war front), especially in Suiyuan, southern Jiangxi, central Hubei, and the areas near Nanchang. The news of the Japanese army withdrawing on all fronts leads one to believe that the Japanese commander-in-chief may temporarily adopt a defensive strategy in the war against China. Japan seems likely to concentrate its efforts on political and economic offensives in the near future. Now that the Nanjing "new regime" has been established, it is said that the Japanese are gradually hoping to defeat China by political means. At the same time, Japan is also attempting to develop the economic resources, trade, and industry in the occupied areas to consolidate what it has gained. If the above observations are correct, there will probably be no large-scale Japanese offensive in any part of China in the short term. Therefore, people are speculating about what policy China will adopt to cope with this new Japanese strategy. China hopes to lure the Japanese army deep inland and further hopes to消耗 (xiāohào, deplete) the Japanese army in the mountains of western China through mobile warfare. If the Japanese army no longer goes deeper, the question arises as to whether the Chinese army will take the offensive or continue to adopt a defensive stance and prolong the stalemate. Although China's supreme commander has not yet announced the Chinese plan, the Chinese armies on all fronts may have the possibility of launching a large-scale counter-offensive in the near future. It is heard that this attack is already being prepared in some areas. After the Japanese army in Suiyuan, southern Jiangxi, and the areas near Nanchang began to shorten their defense lines and redistribute their troops, the Chinese army launched a fierce attack. Well-informed Chinese sources here believe that the opportunity for a general Chinese counter-offensive has not yet arrived, and it does not seem likely that all efforts will be made to recover major cities such as Hangzhou, Nanning, and Nanjing. However, the Chinese army's attacks will continue to be maintained, and if they can be occupied without paying too great a price, they will still be攻取 (gōngqǔ, attacked and captured).

### The Future of the US Dollar

In the past week, there have been dramatic changes in the European war. Germany seized Denmark and attacked Norway, causing an uproar around the world and making people feel惶惑 (huánghuò, perplexed). The exchange rate between British and US currencies has frequently shrunk due to the tense world situation, which has especially encouraged people in Shanghai to accumulate US dollars and increased their interest. With the需求 (xūqiú, demand) being strong, the price naturally rose. But it is not only China that is like this. Since gold from various countries regards the United States as the only safe haven, and US dollars are the most reliable currency in the world, it is fitting that there is a觀 (guān, view) of獨造 (dúzào, originality). Although the United States possesses a huge amount of gold, regardless of whether part of it is deposited by European countries, it is the United States' business to take good care of it. Now that US dollars are as expensive as they are, this is something that the United States can be proud of, but the possible difficulties that are accumulating are something that the world cannot ignore.

The reason why the US dollar is expensive is precisely because the demand for US dollars is huge. The reason why the demand for US dollars is huge is that, first, since the outbreak of the European war, European countries have been demanding more arms and equipment from the United States, which means that more US dollars need to be spent. Secondly, as the scope of global unrest expands, more and more funds from various places seek to escape to the United States. Whenever there is a storage, it is in US dollars, and whenever there is a use, it is in US dollars. US dollars have almost become the world's standard currency, so how can the market not be firm and expensive. As a物 (wù, commodity), currency should not be too expensive or too cheap. Too expensive will hinder the outflow of products, and too cheap will increase the difficulties of general internal life. Although the currencies of various countries 各自为政 (gèzì wèizhèng, each governs its own affairs) and strive to strengthen controls, they are quite able to maintain their nominal levels. In fact, there are those that cannot be maintained and can only allow them to rise and fall naturally, resulting in uneven market conditions. For example, the exchange rate between the US dollar and the British pound is still four yuan and change in London, but only three yuan and four jiao in New York. The exchange rate between the British pound and the US dollar in London is a nominal price, and the exchange rate between the British pound and the US dollar in New York is a real price. In today's Britain, it is by no means a lack of ability to maintain the 名實齐一 (míngshí qiyi, uniformity between name and reality) of the pound's price, but because it is wartime, this is not what it is focusing on.

It is indeed expensive to use US dollars. This is because the credit of the US dollar is strong, which is gratifying. But 美金貴 (měijīn guì, expensive US dollars) means that the US goods purchased by various countries are also expensive. If US goods are expensive, those who use them will change to using goods that are cheaper than US goods because of their high cost, or even制 (jié, restricting) and not use them. If the United States wants to maintain its normal foreign trade, it must either lower prices or lower the currency value to cope. But both of these have their difficulties. Lowering prices will inevitably cause unrest in domestic industry and commerce. Moreover, the United States' measures for industry, commerce, and finance in recent years have been aimed at promoting the external development of industry and commerce and maintaining the stability of international exchange rates. Although the advent of world events does not allow this to continue, the United States still remains a砥柱 (dǐzhù, pillar) in the狂瀾 (kuánglán, turbulent waves), and there is a reason not to lightly change things. Moreover, the various接濟 (jiējì, aid) needed by various countries in wartime are exactly what the United States is seeking. Regardless of whether the US dollar縮 (suō, shrinks) or US goods are貴 (guì, expensive), if the required products cannot be obtained from the United States, they can only be sought from the United States even if they are貴 (guì, expensive). Moreover, it is not only during wartime. After the war ends, there will still be many material resources that need the help of the United States. Therefore, the gold of millions of US dollars stored by various countries in the United States may gradually transfer to become the property of the United States. For example, Japan originally had存金 (cúnjīn, gold deposits) in the United States, but as a result of China's sustained resistance, the Japanese尽耗 (jìnhào, exhausted) their deposits. Because US goods are sold to Japan in an endless stream, which means that Japanese gold偿美 (cháng měi, is paying the US), gradually coming to an end. The same is true for European countries against the United States. However, on the other hand, if the US dollar is firmly昂 (áng, expensive) and does not松 (sōng, loosen) a little, and the amount of gold held by various countries is also decreasing, then the United States' normal foreign exports will inevitably encounter a huge打擊 (dǎjī, blow). For example, recently the British orders for the wool industry in Shanghai have temporarily become very active, while the orders for Italy have become淡 (dàn, sluggish). This is because British gold is平 (píng, flat) and US dollars are紧 (jǐn, tight). It is cheaper to use British gold to place orders than to use US dollars, and Italian goods must be settled in US dollars. So they changed to using British currency to place orders. Even this one point is not enough to槪其餘 (gài qí yú, generalize about the rest). However, like China's foreign trade, which ranked first with the United States before the war, has greatly fallen after the war. There are many reasons for this, and the暴縮 (bàosuō, sharp shrinkage) of the US exchange rate and the 本重 (běnzhòng, high cost) of US goods are one of the important reasons. The貴 (guì, expensiveness) of US dollars is not limited to a corner of China, but is the same in other countries. Then, US industry and commerce, except for the military industry, will eventually feel a沉闷 (chénmèn, depressing) situation one day, and seeking a way to打通开塞 (dǎtōng kāisè, open up the obstruction) will necessarily lower one of the物价 (wùjià, commodity price) and the currency price to make some adjustments. In addition, the only way is to invest abroad to疏散 (shūsàn, disperse) its雄厚 (xiónghòu, strong) funds. Now, I do not know how the United States plans to do it, but it is possible to use several methods at the same time and deal with it carefully. Not only is it possible, but it is also necessary for the United States. Therefore, those who are now沉溺于美滙 (chénnì yú měi huì, addicted to US currency) should also know where to stop.

### General Lu Can Leads Norwegian Army in Resistance, Defense Line Parallels Swedish Border, Report Norwegian Army Recaptures Transit City Hamar

Stockholm, Sweden - The Norwegian government has just appointed General Lu, the country's infantry inspector general, as commander-in-chief of the army to lead the troops in resisting aggression. (Havas dispatch, 11th)

Stockholm, Sweden - The Norwegian government issued a public statement in Elverum last night stating that national mobilization is proceeding in an orderly manner. Authorities are focusing on defense as soldiers gather. German forces are attempting to advance on Elverum but have been repelled near Eidsvoll. The Norwegian General Staff has deployed defenses throughout the western provinces. Defenses in the Bergen area are in place, and there is reason to believe German forces there have been contained. The situation is similar in the Trondelag area. The fortress at Bolærne in the Oslofjord was still resisting yesterday morning. The German forces advancing on Elverum are under the command of the former German air force attaché stationed in Oslo, with the apparent intention of capturing the Norwegian government and members of parliament. Although defenses in the Elverum area are not yet fully in place, Norwegian troops have hastily assembled there, aided by military engineers and members of rifle clubs and training officers. When the German forces attacked, this hastily formed army engaged them for half an hour, eventually driving them back, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy while suffering only two Norwegian casualties. The Norwegian army's combat performance in this engagement is commendable. Another public statement said that the Norwegian government has organized administrative affairs in the new capital. Officials in various regions should await instructions. Mobilization continues according to plan. The Oslo radio station has fallen into German hands, and the cancellation of mobilization orders it announced is a German fabrication. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)

Stockholm, Sweden - Local evening newspapers are reporting that Norwegian authorities have established a very long defense line within the country, running parallel to the Swedish border. The army has requisitioned all private transportation for military use. A unit of the Norwegian army is attempting to dislodge German forces occupying the city of Stavanger, to prevent the forward units of German forces fighting near the Swedish border from linking up with the main German forces stationed in Trondheim. Furthermore, all indications suggest that the Quisling-led Norwegian puppet government was prepared well before the German invasion and had planted supporters in key ports, especially Narvik. (Havas dispatch, 11th)

Stockholm, Sweden - According to news broadcast by a local radio station, the Norwegian army has recaptured the transit city of Hamar and pushed the German forces back to a point 50 kilometers south of the city. As of last night, the outer defense line between Oslo and Boholmarna was still in Norwegian hands. Furthermore, Norwegian authorities claim that the railway line from Trondheim to the Swedish border has been occupied by German forces. They also deny that British troops have landed at Narvik. (Havas dispatch, 11th)

Stockholm, Sweden - According to reports in local newspapers, Trondheim, located 100 kilometers from the Swedish border, is under German control. German forces have advanced from Trondheim in two directions, north and south. The situation in Narvik remains unchanged, with the Germans controlling the city and harbor. It is unknown whether Tromsø, located 150 kilometers north of Narvik, has been occupied by German forces or is still in Norwegian hands. (Haitong dispatch, 12th)

### German War Report

Berlin - The German High Command has announced that Denmark is calm and peaceful. The German air force on the west coast of Denmark has not encountered any enemy aircraft. In Norway, German forces in Narvik continue to advance and have occupied Evignes without any fighting. British aircraft attacked Trondheim but were repelled. A British light warship attempted to enter Trondheim Bay but was unsuccessful. Bergen, Stavanger, and Kristiansand Bay are all calm and peaceful. British aircraft attacked Stavanger, and one was shot down by anti-aircraft artillery. German forces near Oslo are also advancing in all directions. The German navy continued operations yesterday and sank two British cruisers near Narvik. (Haitong dispatch, 12th)

### Reports of Unusual German Activity, Major War About to Break Out on Western Front, Netherlands Takes Defensive Measures, Belgium Completes Mobilization

Paris - Authoritative sources stated yesterday that the French high command believes Germany is preparing to attack the Western Front. French army analysts say that a major war is about to break out on the Western Front. Germany is making obvious preparations at several points on the front line. News from the Netherlands says that Dutch authorities, as a precautionary measure, have evacuated Dutch villagers living near the German border. (United Press dispatch, 12th)

London - Belief that Germany is about to launch a major offensive on the Western Front has increased here last night. Many believe that the Netherlands or Belgium is on Hitler's action timetable. Not only amateur strategists but also most experts believe that Germany's adventure in Scandinavia, in addition to its direct objectives, is using a feint to divert Allied attention to the Scandinavian countries so that Germany can invade the Netherlands and Belgium using blitzkrieg tactics. An experienced Dutch commentator expressed serious doubts about the Netherlands' ability to resist Germany fiercely. However, it is generally believed that Belgium will fiercely resist any German invasion. (United Press dispatch, 12th)

Amsterdam - The Netherlands has stepped up defensive measures against a possible German blitzkrieg. Yesterday, women and children working for the Philips Radio Tube Company in Eindhoven were evacuated. The area is located on the Dutch-German border north of Blerick. Military sources say this is a precautionary measure and ask residents to remain calm. (United Press dispatch, 12th)

Amsterdam - It is reported that German troops outside the Dutch border have received extra ammunition. Military precautions continue in the Netherlands today, and troops are being deployed. All this work is done at night to avoid attention. The general public knows very little about the new arrangements. Authorities have also taken some important steps to ensure that the government maintains absolute control over the country in the event of an incident. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)

"Daily Telegraph" Paris dispatch - Paris has received news of new German threats to the Netherlands and Belgium. Many believe that the fate of Denmark and Norway has caused the Netherlands and Belgium to consider whether they can wait for a definite German offensive before requesting assistance from the Allies. It is generally believed that the German government has informed the Dutch and Belgian representatives in Germany that any attempt by the Netherlands and Belgium to place themselves under the protection of Britain and France will prompt a swift German attack. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)

Brussels - The Belgian government yesterday announced that the mobilization of the Belgian army had been completed. Before the German invasion of Scandinavia, the Belgian government had conducted various secret examinations of the Belgian-German border defense line. After the outbreak of the German-Scandinavian war, the Belgian government immediately dispatched several high-ranking military officers to the border to inspect defense conditions, so that they could clearly understand that Belgium must be able to stay out of the current European war. The Belgian government has already taken various military measures, and its neighboring countries are able to respect Belgium's neutral status. Since the outbreak of the European war eight months ago, the Belgian army has already completed mobilization, and various defensive works have also been completed in sequence. If an aggressor wishes to take action against Belgium, it will definitely not be able to drive straight in. The Belgian government will make this clear. (Havas dispatch, 11th)

### Belgian Foreign Minister Says Every Effort Will Be Made to Avoid War, If Neutral Status Is Violated, Will Defend Territory with Utmost Sacrifice

Brussels - Today, Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak gave a speech stating that Belgium's main problem at present is whether it will stay out of the war. The Belgian government will make every effort to avoid war. However, if it is unfortunately drawn into the vortex, all our efforts will be aimed at defending our country's territory. We must be strong and united and know how to make the greatest sacrifices. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)

### Tense Situation in Southern Sweden, Major Cities Evacuate Women and Children, Reservists Enlisting One After Another, Mines Laid in Western Territorial Waters

Gothenburg, Sweden - The situation in southern Sweden is very tense. It is reported that a large number of German soldiers have set out by sea and air and could land on the Swedish coast at any time. Several squadrons of German aircraft intruded into Swedish airspace this morning, and an air raid alert was once issued in this city. Swedish authorities have taken various military measures to prepare for any eventuality. Major cities such as this city, Jönköping, Malmö, and Helsingborg have begun evacuating women and children. Railway and automobile transportation is very busy. In addition, the construction of air raid shelters is also underway. All cities across the country have implemented a blackout from 5:00 PM today. (Havas dispatch, 12th)

Stockholm, Sweden - Blast sounds are nearly continuous as air raid shelters are being blasted out of mountain rock. There was no blackout here last night, but all preparations for contingencies are underway. Reservists have been arriving at barracks all day yesterday. Germany does not seem to have taken any specific action regarding Sweden, but many believe that Germany will inevitably demand concessions from Sweden, especially to use Swedish railways. Well-informed sources in Sweden claim that the issue of German demands on Sweden has not yet arisen. However, Sweden is determined to defend its independence and territorial integrity under any circumstances. (Reuters dispatch, 11th)

### Britain Lays Mines in the North Sea Area

London - The Admiralty announces that certain areas of the North Sea, the Skagerrak, and the Kattegat have been mined and are therefore dangerous areas. They border the coasts of Denmark and Germany, as well as the territorial waters of Sweden and the Netherlands. It also states that no mines have been laid in a channel ten miles wide on either side of certain points. The westernmost limit of the minefield extends 420 miles north from Fyvom near Schiermonnikoog off the Dutch coast to a point 60 miles southwest of Bergen. It then extends east, encompassing the entire North Sea, reaching the Danish coast. The Skagerrak is also within it. In view of the comments made by Germany after the Allies laid mines in Norwegian territorial waters and subsequent events, this minefield does not extend into Swedish or Dutch territorial waters at any point, to avoid giving Germany an excuse. It also leaves a channel two miles wide in the center of the minefield, so that neutral ships can safely sail from the Swedish coast into the unmined part of the North Sea. The new minefield in the Skagerrak and the Kattegat has cut off Germany's access to the North Sea via the Skagerrak. German ships that now cross the Skagerrak directly to the Oslofjord or to the fortresses occupied by German forces in southwestern Norway will be at risk. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)

### A Fierce Battle in the North Sea, German Fleet "Crippled," Nearly One-Tenth of Its Entire Force Lost, Churchill Reports British Naval Victories

London - British First Lord of the Admiralty Churchill reported to the House of Commons yesterday on naval battles, saying, "I must acknowledge that the German navy is now crippled in important respects. I believe that the German navy's actions, which have been adventurous but have come at a heavy price, are only a prelude to the larger events that will occur on land. However, we are prepared to resist the enemy's greatest threats and will devote our lives and strength to achieving the victory that the world needs. The German navy has now suffered very heavy losses. The Norwegian artillery has played a role in inflicting damage on the enemy. I believe that Hitler has expanded the war to the north, forcing the people of the Scandinavian Peninsula to change their neutral attitude. Since Sunday, four German cruisers, accounting for half of their pre-war strength, have now been sunk, and many destroyers and submarines have also been lost." (Reuters dispatch, 12th)

London - A Reuters naval correspondent says that the losses on both sides in this week's naval battles cannot be accurately compared at this time, but rough estimates can confirm the accuracy of Churchill's statement that "the German fleet is now crippled in key areas." According to available information, before the war, the Germans had eight cruisers and thirty destroyers. Now, four cruisers have been lost, and three destroyers are known to have been lost. Another two or three may have sunk. In addition, several submarines and more than ten supply ships have been lost. German ships damaged include one battleship, one cruiser, and several destroyers. According to current estimates, Britain had 160 destroyers before the war. Four have been lost, and two destroyers and one battlecruiser have been damaged. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)

### Churchill’s Speech Full Text (Continued and Completed)

During last night’s dusk attack, the enemy used sixty aircraft in a continuous wave-like assault. We suffered no losses, while at least six enemy aircraft were shot down (cheers). This achievement is due to the effectiveness of our artillery and the appropriate combined efforts of our air force. The safe anchorage of our fleet in Scapa Flow is of utmost importance. The repeated attacks by German aircraft have provided our artillery units with opportunities to practice their anti-aircraft gunnery. We have never had such moving targets before (cheers and laughter).

Now, let me talk about matters beyond Scapa Flow. When undertaking risky actions, we naturally prepare for unexpected losses. Our aircraft have been conducting reconnaissance over the entire North Sea. On Sunday night, it was reported that a German battlecruiser and several other cruisers and destroyers were speeding north. Upon receiving the report, our fleet in Scapa Flow immediately prepared for action, and the Commander-in-Chief personally led the ships out to sea. Simultaneously, another strong British naval force sped toward Narvik to lay a minefield off the Norwegian coast, aiming to achieve the purpose I mentioned earlier. At dawn on Sunday, the mine laying was completed according to plan. The mine-laying ships then withdrew to avoid any potential conflict with Norwegian warships maintaining Norway's neutrality. When the destroyer HMS “Glowworm” was heading north to join the fleet on Sunday afternoon, it sighted the first enemy destroyer at 8:00 AM on Monday, followed by two more, and engaged in battle.

The ship then reported that an unknown number of enemy ships were active in the north. Reports of these incidents arrived every few minutes, but the final report was abruptly cut off. We believe that the ship engaged a superior enemy fleet and must have been sunk in the battle. This encounter indicated that a significant number of enemy naval vessels had entered the sea and that many events were already underway. Since then, the battle has continued day and night without stopping and is still ongoing. Currently, we have not secured any ports along the Norwegian coast, so the full extent of the situation is not yet known. There are many reports in the news, but they are all rumors from neutral sources, and the truth will be known later.

Churchill continued, "Now, I will try to summarize the main events for you. On Monday morning, the enemy fleet, which sank the British ship HMS “Glowworm” and included a German battlecruiser and other important warships, appeared to be surrounded by the northern British fleet and the main British domestic fleet. Both of these British fleets were stronger than the enemy fleet. However, the enemy fleet escaped. Looking at the map with flags indicating positions, you might think there would be a certain outcome, but when you are at sea, there is only water and sky, an endless expanse, surging waves, thick fog, and the darkness of night, making it difficult to track the enemy ships. At such times, you cannot expect to be able to measure the advances and retreats of the army as you would on land."

On Tuesday, while patrolling south of Bergen, the British fleet was under constant attack by German aircraft. German radio regularly broadcasted news of the sinking or severe damage to several British battleships and cruisers, but in reality, only two cruisers suffered minor damage that did not hinder their operation. These two ships are still with the fleet. The British flagship HMS "Rodney" was hit by a large bomb, but the ship's deck armor was very strong, and despite the explosion, the ship was not damaged, with only four crew members and three sailors injured. Considering the structure of British warships, this is considered very satisfactory (cheers). The British cruiser HMS "Aurora" was attacked five times by bombers, but all failed. However, the destroyer HMS "Gurkha" was directly hit, causing the ship to list and sink after four and a half hours. Almost all of the crew were rescued. On Tuesday afternoon, the British destroyer HMS "Zulu" sank a German submarine off the Orkney Islands. On Tuesday morning, the British battlecruiser HMS "Renown" sighted the German battlecruiser "Scharnhorst" and a 10,000-ton cruiser off Narvik. At that time, the seas were treacherous, and in the high winds, HMS "Renown" opened fire at a range of 18,000 yards. After three minutes, the enemy ships returned fire and then sped away. HMS "Renown," after nine minutes of shelling, saw that the front of "Scharnhorst" had been hit and no longer returned fire, with only the rear beginning to return fire. The German ship was very fast, and HMS "Renown" moved forward at a speed of 24 knots. After another two minutes, a plume of thick smoke rose from the German ship, indicating it had been hit by a second shell. At this time, the 10,000-ton German cruiser laid a smokescreen behind "Scharnhorst," and the two German ships fled at full speed.

Churchill continued, "British submarines have sunk a large number of German transport ships and supply ships. All German ships in the Skagerrak and Kattegat will be sunk. By evening, when the opportunity arises, all enemy ships will be sunk. We will not allow the enemy to pass through these waters without difficulty to supply their army. To date, more than ten enemy ships, some of which are large, have been sunk or captured in the Kattegat or other parts of the North Sea while attempting to transport supplies to troops landing in Narvik."

Based on the information we obtained from the Naval Department late Tuesday, we believed that the military operation was quite dangerous. Therefore, at 1:00 AM, we notified the commander of a destroyer flotilla, instructing him to use his own judgment on whether to attack. We will support all of his actions, regardless of what happens (cheers). The commander then led five destroyers forward and attacked enemy destroyers and shore batteries. His initial report only mentioned our losses, which I will announce immediately, because I believe we should not hide such events. Since we are at war, we are always prepared to accept setbacks. After receiving the report at around 1:00 AM, I immediately sent it to the Prime Minister, who immediately announced it to the House of Commons, the country, and the press. After receiving any news, whether good or bad, we will send it to Parliament, the Prime Minister, and the newspapers.

We later received a report that our destroyers, while returning, encountered the enemy ship "Rauenfels," loaded with reserve munitions. I believe the enemy intended to use these munitions to turn Narvik into a strong fortress, like Sevastopol or Gibraltar. That ship was sunk. We must admit that this will reduce our current workload.

The British Air Force has been constantly flying reconnaissance, bombing, and protecting the Navy. I would like to express my gratitude on behalf of my naval colleagues. Yesterday, this Air Force sent two groups of twelve aircraft each to attack the two German cruisers in Bergen Harbor, which were protecting the troops landing there. One bomb immediately disappeared. Yesterday evening, British Naval Air Arm aircraft also flew from their base in the Orkneys to Bergen to attack another German cruiser that had not been sunk, dropping three 500-pound bombs on it. Fifteen of the sixteen British aircraft returned. Later, aircraft were dispatched for reconnaissance. It was reported that the ship was no longer at its original mooring, and there was only an oil slick about a mile long on the surface of the harbor. At dawn today, eighteen Naval Air Arm aircraft, each carrying torpedoes, attacked enemy ships in Trondheim. We had hoped to sink a Hipper-class German cruiser that was moored there, but that ship had sailed the previous night, so the result was only the sinking of one enemy destroyer."

Mr. Churchill added that the Faroe Islands are a very important military base. The residents of the islands have expressed a warm welcome to the British army. I hope to give a further report to Parliament in a few days.

Labour MP Alexander then spoke, warning people to be wary of rumors. He said he would prefer to hear delayed but accurate news. He also said that we should explain to the neutral countries in the dangerous areas the remarks made by certain quarters in Turkey this morning, which said that this week’s events further prove that they only have two paths to follow: to resolutely accept German control or to fight alongside the Allied countries.

Liberal leader Sinclair also spoke, saying that Churchill’s remarks were serious and appropriate, and that these two qualities were deeply gratifying. Today, we can rejoice that the German aggressors have been severely punished by the British Navy. It is not only the British who rejoice. Norway’s defense is admirable, and the British government should provide effective assistance in a timely manner. He does not believe that the people understand how important the current work is. Minimizing the impact of Germany’s recent steps is not beneficial to the people and is detrimental to the cause of joint operations. He would like to say one more thing: do not make optimistic predictions to the people, but firmly grasp reality and tell them the truth. Although things are difficult, they are sufficient to strengthen the people’s determination to persevere to the end. We cannot rule out the possibility that Germany’s attack on Norway is a feint. Once our attention is diverted, Germany may strike elsewhere. (Reuters, 11th)

Correction: The last seven lines of Churchill's speech in yesterday's report should be deleted.

### British and French Naval Power Absolutely Superior; Polish Ships Join the Battle; French Prime Minister Reports on the War Situation

Paris: French Prime Minister Reynaud announced in the Chamber of Deputies that as a result of the historical naval battle off the coast of Norway yesterday, it is said that 22 ships sank to the bottom of the sea, including 18 German ships and 4 British ships. None were French. Germany’s initial tactical victory has proven to be a major strategic error. Germany’s iron ore transport line has been cut off and will remain impassable from now on. The British Navy lost 4 destroyers, and the German Navy lost 4 cruisers, accounting for one-tenth of its entire cruiser fleet, and lost 1 destroyer and 12 troop carriers. Germany needs steel to attack us, but now it is acting like a besieged army breaking out. Germany ravaged Denmark and then hastily invaded Norway, thinking it would not encounter more resistance than it did in Austria in 1938, but it did not expect the Norwegians to resist like the Belgians in 1914. The entire chamber stood up and cheered as the Prime Minister said this. Reynaud also described the naval situation in the war, saying that there is no precedent in history for a navy that is certainly at a disadvantage to fight without losing. The French fleet and Polish warships have joined the British ships in battle. (Reuters, 12th)

### Germany’s Invasion of Northern Europe a Major Mistake

Washington: British Naval Minister Churchill's clear announcement yesterday of British losses has created a very good impression here. The general public infers from Churchill’s account of the Scandinavian naval battle that the development of the war is favorable to the Allied countries, and that Hitler's invasion of Norway is a major strategic error. (Reuters, 12th)

Berlin: According to sources here, the British naval losses acknowledged by British Defence Committee Chairman Churchill in the House of Commons yesterday were mostly previous losses. For example, the HMS "Rodney" was said by Churchill to have been damaged yesterday, but in fact, it was damaged by a German air raid on the British naval base at Scapa Flow on March 16.

Hong Kong: It is said here today that the British Navy stationed in Hong Kong is now preparing to seize 40 to 50 Norwegian and Danish ships off the Chinese coast.

### Britain Resolves Not to Allow Germany to Gain a Foothold in Iceland; The Safety of Danish Greenland Becomes a Question

London: Naval Minister Churchill announced in the House of Commons yesterday that British troops have occupied the Faroe Islands, but have not retaken Norwegian ports. Iceland is still under consideration. Once Denmark is liberated, the Faroe Islands will be returned to their original owners. British troops should take what they want on the Norwegian coast to enhance their blockade effectiveness and will not allow the Germans to gain a foothold in Iceland. From a strategic and military point of view, we have a great advantage in Scandinavia and the northern European seas. (Reuters, 12th)

London: Foreign affairs figures here have declared that the situation caused by Iceland’s separation from Denmark is being closely watched by the British and French governments, and that they will discuss the protection issue with the Icelandic government. The United States will also participate at that time because its interests are affected. As for the Faroe Islands, which belong to Denmark, they have been occupied by British troops. There is no difficulty in finding a legal explanation for this move, but Iceland is an independent country, and the situation is different. Therefore, Britain has no intention of occupying it. In addition, Danish Greenland is not likely to be threatened in the short term. If Germany invades it, Britain and France will immediately deal with it from Canada. (Havas, 12th)

Ottawa: Prime Minister Mackenzie King recently told the press that after German troops invaded Denmark and Norway, the Canadian federal government is exchanging views with the British government and will consult with the US government to determine policies on Danish Greenland and Iceland. He also said that he would travel to the United States for a weekend vacation in Virginia and spend a day or two in Washington to visit President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull in the name of "friendship" and take the opportunity to talk with British Ambassador Lord Lothian. (Havas, 12th)

Washington: After Germany's invasion of Denmark and Norway, the status of Danish Greenland has become an issue. Some members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee advocate that the US government should extend the Monroe Doctrine to the island. California Democratic Congressman Isaac said that Greenland is located on the shipping lanes between the United States and Europe, and its fate is vital to the United States. Connecticut Democratic Congressman Stanley said that if one of the warring countries in Europe wants to occupy the island, the United States should protect it. New Jersey Republican Congressman Eaton said, "Denmark and Greenland are the location of a new world crisis." (Havas, 12th)

### Soviet Union Denies German Troops Passing Through

Moscow: According to the Berlin correspondent of the "New York Times", most of the German troops occupying Narvik passed through Leningrad and Murmansk.

### German Aircraft Fly Over Paris; Repelled by Anti-Aircraft Fire

### Japanese People Fear Going to War; Violate National Mobilization Law; Those in Vocational Circles Avoid Registering

Tokyo: "Miyako Shimbun" reported that Japanese authorities have now found the results of the national vocational registration system unsatisfactory. Since its implementation, there have been about 3,000 people violating these regulations in Tokyo alone. The national vocational registration system is implemented in accordance with Article 21 of the National Mobilization Law, which stipulates that people in 134 designated occupations must report their age, address, and other relevant information to the vocational department of the local government so that the authorities can conscript necessary personnel for wartime needs. Now, in Tokyo, there are daily cases of people who are required to register not registering or making false reports. Graduates of Russian, Spanish, and Mongolian language departments and those who can drive cars are especially unwilling to report to the authorities. In light of this situation, the Tokyo Vocational Department and the Ministry of Health and Welfare have decided to take stricter measures against those who refuse to report, as this system has now passed its one-year trial period since its implementation.

### British-Japanese Talks in Tokyo; Craigie Dined at Arita’s Luncheon; US Commissioner to the Philippines to Visit Tokyo for Discussions with Ambassador Grew

Tokyo: Japanese sources said that Japanese Foreign Minister Arita invited British Ambassador Craigie and members of the British Embassy to a luncheon at his official residence today. Sir Craigie has temporarily postponed his departure for the United States for vacation, but it is widely believed that he will travel to the United States soon. It was also reported from Manila that US Commissioner to the Philippines, Sayre, will arrive in Tokyo on the "President Pierce" on the 18th of this month to hold important military discussions with US Ambassador Grew. Sayre will be accompanied by his wife and Naval Attaché Lieutenant Commander Eckvall. It is expected that he will return to Manila from Kobe by ship on May 6. The public attaches great importance to Sayre’s visit, as Grew will return to the United States for vacation after Sayre leaves Japan for Manila. (Reuters, 12th)

London: British MP Sandeman said yesterday that the Japanese have blockaded the British concession in Tianjin for about nine months, and the residents are living in detention, their businesses are being destroyed, and they are suffering humiliation. How long will this situation be tolerated? Under-Secretary of State Butler replied that talks to resolve the Tianjin issue are currently underway in Tokyo. The Japanese government, in view of the British negotiations, is well aware of the British government's attitude towards restricting British trade and discriminating against British shipping. The British government is now closely watching the general issues related to improving British-Japanese relations. (Reuters, 12th)

### Britain Should Strengthen Aid to China: Hollington Tong's Proposal

London: Hollington Tong, Chairman of the Manchester China Relief Committee, wrote to the Manchester Guardian today that after the establishment of the Nanjing puppet government, Britain should provide stronger, not weaker, aid to the real government of China. Britain may not yet realize that Japan is still completely unable to conquer even its so-called occupied areas. There are now one million guerrillas in East China who continue to fight behind Japanese lines. The establishment of the puppet government is an attempt by Japan to reverse its military failure through conspiracy. Any recognition of the puppet government by Britain, even if indirect, will undoubtedly help Japan to finally achieve its goal of driving Western powers out of the Far East. (Reuters, 12th)

### United States Decides to Build More Battleships; New Navy Budget Approved by Senate Committee

Washington: The US Navy Department has decided to build ten new battleships and modernize three submarines.

The plan to build warships has been included in this year's budget, which will begin on July 1, 1940. The cost of building warships is estimated to be approximately $965,000,000. (Haitong Telegraph, 12th)

Washington: The US Navy budget has been passed by the House of Representatives, and the Senate Naval Committee also passed it yesterday. The total budget is $67,000,000, an increase of $44,000,000 over last year, but a decrease of $119,000,000 from the government's original plan. However, it has broken the budget record in peacetime. (Haitong Telegraph, 13th)

Washington: The Senate Appropriations Committee yesterday reported the Navy's budget of $967,414,878, authorizing the construction of new ships and the enhancement of the naval base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. This budget includes the construction of two 45,000-ton battleships, two cruisers, one aircraft carrier, and eight destroyers, as well as expenses for Pearl Harbor's oil storage, air defense network, and improvement of the harbor's waterways.

### Japanese Munitions Industry Deformed Development; Munitions Merchants Suddenly Become Rich and Display Elegance by Playing with Calligraphy and Painting

Tokyo: According to "Chugai Commercial News", the munitions industry has developed abnormally since the outbreak of the China Incident. For two years now, shareholders of general munitions factories and owners of tea houses and taverns have become extremely wealthy and are competing to purchase precious calligraphy and paintings to show their elegance. The prices of calligraphy and paintings have increased by ten to twenty times compared to 1937. Among them, ancient Buddhist statues, which have always been enjoyed by business tycoons, have also soared in price. However, there are more fakes in ancient paintings, and buyers are easily deceived. Therefore, nouveau riche buyers prefer the works of modern famous painters. When Kyoto's famous painter Shoen Uemura auctioned off a painting the other day, the price rose to 17,000 yen, but after police intervention, it was deemed too expensive and was finally sold for 15,000 yen. (Havas, 11th)

### Soybeans Can Be Made into Spray Paint

New York: Soybeans, a specialty of China, can be used to make soy milk and are known as "Chinese milk." Two years ago, the DuPont Motor Company here used them as a raw material to try to make spray paint, which has now been successfully completed. It is of excellent quality, has a natural color, is not affected by sunlight and gasification, and the car, once sprayed, only needs to be washed regularly to maintain its beauty and become more durable. The shiny and gorgeous car bodies of the latest models of cars are due to the use of soybean-based spray paint. It is expected that after the promotion of this new invention, the world's car spray paint industry will be completely changed. (Havas, 11th)

### Japanese Nurses Insufficiently Distributed

Tokyo: According to "Kokumin Shimbun", Japan originally had 10,000 female nurses, but due to their dispatch to serve in China and "Manchukuo", the number has decreased to only a little over 7,000, which is felt to be insufficiently distributed. The 375 nurses' associations here are now working hard to recruit new nurses to replenish the ranks. (Havas, 11th)

### Japan to Revise Restrictions on the Pearl River

Tokyo - Japanese sources report that the Japanese Army and Navy Commanders in South China issued a joint announcement this morning, stating that restrictions on trade on the Pearl River will be revised from the 20th of this month. Within the scope that does not hinder military operations, general trade will be permitted up to Guangzhou. The Japanese authorities have informed third-country authorities, stating that foreign ships are now permitted to navigate the Pearl River carrying general goods, provided they comply with the existing conditions regarding navigation and anchoring. Goods harmful to the maintenance of peace and order, and pacification efforts, will be treated as contraband. Third-country authorities should notify the Japanese authorities in advance of any goods destined for Guangzhou. According to Mr. Kita, the Japanese Consul-General in Guangzhou, the current measures do not represent a complete reopening of the Pearl River for navigation and trade. However, he hopes that the restrictions will be modified as much as possible and hopes for sympathetic understanding and cooperation from third countries towards Japan's true intentions.

### Heated Electioneering is a Thing of the Past, New Directors to Take Office on Schedule, Election of Chairman and Vice-Chairman on the 18th, All Parties Give Unified Attention to the Proposed Tax Increase

The results of the Shanghai Municipal Council director election were announced yesterday, and the outcome of five British, two American, and two Japanese directors being elected has been confirmed, maintaining the original situation. The Japanese ambition to monopolize the concession through an election victory has been completely shattered. Recalling four years ago, in 1936, the Japanese also made a request to increase the number of Japanese directors. At that time, due to the strong attitude of the British and Americans, they were unable to achieve their objective. This is the second failure. However, although the Japanese have suffered these repeated failures, their desire to control the concession and feast on it is not willing to quietly cease. They will undoubtedly continue to use legal advancements to assist illegal seizures, and at the same time use illegal threats to promote legal advancements. Thus, it remains for the British, Americans, and other foreign residents in Shanghai to handle this situation well.

British and American Victory, Hearts Greatly Relieved

At the beginning of the Shanghai Municipal Council director election, the Japanese decided to tear up the gentlemen's agreement of the five-two-two British-American-Japanese ratio. They publicly declared that they had mastered a "secret strategy for certain victory." In recent days, they have been using their military and political special forces to work and coerce all parties from top to bottom. Their strength is indeed not to be underestimated. However, yesterday morning's announcement revealed that the British and Americans had defeated them. Their desire to seize Shanghai has already failed. After the news of this victory was revealed in the newspapers yesterday morning, both Chinese and foreigners were greatly relieved. It is fervently hoped that the seven British and American directors who were elected will uphold the spirit they showed when participating in the election, and serve the concession with their original intentions, with the welfare of millions of Chinese as the foundation, and maintain close contact with the five Chinese directors. In that case, the interests of third countries in the concession can not only be ensured, but also the increasing prosperity of the concession can be expected.

Re-elected Chinese Directors, Candidates for Chinese Committee Members

The Shanghai Municipal Council recently approved a letter from the Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers Association, stating that Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Ludeng, Guo Shun, Jiang Yiping, and Xi Yushu have been elected by the current meeting of ratepayers as Chinese directors of the Shanghai Municipal Council for the years 1940 to 1941. In addition, Lin Kanghou, Xu Guanqun, Xu Xiaochu, Liu Shifang, Li Wenjie, and Chen Tingrui have been elected as Chinese committee members of the Shanghai Municipal Council. Furthermore, Jin Zongcheng has been appointed as a real estate committee member of the Shanghai Municipal Council.

Newly Elected Directors to Take Office on Schedule

The election of the Shanghai Municipal Council directors by the Chinese, British, American, and Japanese has been completed. It is reported that the nine newly elected foreign directors and the five re-elected Chinese directors are scheduled to take office in the meeting room of the Shanghai Municipal Council on the 18th of this month, the day after the ratepayers' annual meeting on the 17th of this month. The chairman and vice-chairman will also be elected at that time.

All Parties Pay Attention to the Proposed Tax Increase

The annual meeting of foreign ratepayers is scheduled to be held at 2:30 PM on the 17th of this month. The proposal to increase the municipal general tax, special property tax, and land tax surcharge by 51% is receiving unanimous attention from all parties. At a time when the market is outwardly strong but inwardly weak, and the livelihoods of the citizens are extremely difficult, it is hoped that this proposal will be rejected at the meeting. Furthermore, foreign residents attending the annual meeting must comply with the provisions of Article 19 of the Land Regulations, which states that "Only ratepayers who are absent from the consular area or unable to attend the meeting due to illness may authorize a representative to attend and vote at the ratepayers' annual meeting. The authorization must be in the form of a written authorization certificate, signed by the authorizing ratepayer, and must state the reason within the certificate. If due to illness, a medical certificate must also be submitted. The authorization form can be obtained from the Shanghai Municipal Council Revenue Office."

Japanese Failure, Subsequent Remarks

Mr. Lin Xiongji (Chairman of the Japanese Residents' Election Committee) made a statement, the gist of which is as follows: "It is regrettable that this election failed to achieve the expected goal. As the Chairman of the Election Committee, I feel that I have no excuse to face the Japanese residents. Regarding the issue of the concession, we originally advocated abandoning the dictatorial state and seeking true 'internationalization' to make Shanghai an ideal,

International City

in order to improve the happiness of the residents. This noble proposition is completely different from egoists. However, the most important thing in the election is not who wins or loses, but the correctness of the platform. In order to implement our reasonable proposition, we will redouble our efforts and continue to struggle until we succeed. Whether this election was conducted fairly and appropriately, and the unreasonable points of the current election system, should be

Fully Reviewed

and appropriate measures should be taken to amend them. We will never be discouraged by the results of this election. To prepare for a comeback in next year's election, we should start preparing from today." Lin Xiongji's statement has at least a semi-official nature. His "ambition" has not died, which is conceivable. Furthermore, a spokesperson for the Japanese Embassy told Western reporters yesterday, "The ultimate goal of the Japanese government is to abolish the consular jurisdiction and concession powers here, but

This Ideal

is difficult to achieve in a short time. As a last resort, we seek to improve the administration of the International Settlement. The results of the Shanghai Municipal Council director election have now been announced, but the process was tortuous and still needs to be investigated. The Japanese hope to obtain a superior position in the Shanghai Municipal Council has never changed. I further hope to achieve this wish through legal procedures, but this statement does not imply the use of various illegal means.

British and American Residents

believe that the revision of the Land Regulations of Yangjingbang is not yet the time, which is extremely unreasonable from the Japanese point of view. The establishment of these regulations began in 1846. In the face of the rapid progress of the world, the old regulations are certainly difficult to meet the current needs." In addition, he also attacked the principle of using property as the standard for the number of directors of the Shanghai Municipal Council. He said, "As the world evolves, we should

Value Population

rather than property, but Shanghai's adherence to the old ways is truly astonishing. If this principle can be established, then the Shanghai Municipal Council can be managed by nine millionaires." Finally, the spokesperson also expressed his willingness to congratulate all those elected, saying, "Elections are a kind of competition, and both sides should maintain the personality of a competitor."

A Retrospective Account of Tallying Votes Through the Night

After voting closed simultaneously in the Fuzhou Road International Settlement Volunteer Corps drill ground and the Hongkou Xiaocai Chang districts at 3:00 PM the day before yesterday, the supervisor at the International Settlement Volunteer Corps drill ground, Mr. Browns (Norwegian), ordered assistants to move ballot boxes No. 2 and No. 4 to the Shanghai Municipal Council meeting room and begin checking the registration forms and permits. Half an hour later, the supervisor at the Hongkou Xiaocai Chang, Mr. Bullingert (Swedish), also arrived, and Japanese and Indian police officers carried ballot boxes No. 1 and No. 3. The ballot boxes were opened and votes were tallied at around 5:00 PM. Sixteen assistants participated in the vote tallying, including two Japanese assistants. The meeting room was immediately closed at that time, and extra Western, Indian, Chinese and Japanese police officers and patrolmen were dispatched to guard the door. The vote tallying work was not completed until 3:20 AM yesterday morning. Senior Shanghai Municipal Council officials, such as Director-General Fellypus, Deputy Director-General Cabot, Director Neasy, Assistant Allen, and Director of the Intelligence Office Fulan Shan, all worked through the night. In particular, the election affairs assistant specially appointed by the Municipal Council was the most nervous, as he had to be consulted by the supervisors at any time. The work was not completed until 4:00 AM yesterday morning.

British and American Foreign Residents Should Know to Be Awakened

A Reuters dispatch from Chongqing on the 12th states that a New China Daily editorial this morning issued a warning to foreign countries, roughly stating that yesterday's Shanghai International Settlement Municipal Council director election should make all countries understand Japan's intention to dominate China and completely exclude foreign interests. The current situation in Shanghai is a direct result of foreign appeasement policies towards Japan. In the past two and a half years, the Shanghai Municipal Council has accepted every request made by the Japanese. However, every time the Municipal Council makes a concession, the Japanese will follow it up with a new request. The Japanese objective is to exclude the rights and interests of third countries in China. This election is only part of the Japanese process. Although the British and Americans are able to maintain the status quo at this moment, it can be asserted that the Japanese will inevitably exert stronger pressure. Foreign residents in China should urge their respective governments to change their policies and provide China with material assistance in order to effectively curb Japanese aggression in order to preserve their own rights and interests in China.

### The Attitude of the Newly Elected Directors, Mr. Allman Claims He Benefited from His Surname, Mr. Carnell is Willing to Invite Reporters to Drink Beer

The Shanghai Municipal Council's foreign directors election concluded yesterday morning at 3:30 AM after extremely tense competition, maintaining the five-two-two ratio of British, American, and Japanese directors. American director Allman received the most votes, with 80,000 votes, and was the most watched. The statements of the elected candidates are recorded below.

Mr. Allman is the Most Popular

The English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post reports that the results of the Shanghai Municipal Council director election have been announced. When asked why Mr. Allman received the most votes, he replied that unexpected events are inevitable. His surname begins with the letter A and is listed at the top of the ballot, making it the easiest to fill in. Furthermore, he did not wish to express any further opinions.

Mr. Carnell Promises to Treat Reporters to Beer

Mr. Carnell of Standard Oil stated that he was quite pleased with the results of this election and that he was the second-highest vote-getter, but he did not say anything else. When asked when he would fulfill his promise made during the election campaign, Mr. Carnell said he had not made any promises. The reporter told him that he was willing to provide news reporters with free wine every day. Mr. Carnell laughed upon hearing this and said that this promise can be fulfilled immediately.

The Japanese Representative is Disheartened

Mr. Yuta Hanawa, manager of Mitsui Bussan Kaisha, who was re-elected, replied to reporters, "We have done our best. It is very regrettable that we have failed." When asked if the restoration of police administration on the north bank of the Suzhou Creek would therefore be delayed, Mr. Hanawa replied, "That is not the case. This is a separate matter." Furthermore, according to Japanese lawyer Koichi Okamoto, he did not want to talk too much because he had lost the election. However, he did not feel particularly surprised because it was inevitable that two Japanese candidates would lose, but he could not predict which one would lose. This is irreversible, he said.

Mr. Kezia Will's Witty Reply

Mr. Kezia Will, the British candidate who received the most votes, also did not wish to make any statement. Mr. Bawyer, the manager of Asiatic Petroleum Company who was elected, had stated during the election campaign that the Shanghai Municipal Council's administrative policy must be better publicized. He replied to reporters, "I do not know you. It is not convenient to make statements of this nature over the phone."

### Yu Qiaqing Righteously Takes Action, Mortgages Private Property to Advocate Price Controls on Rice, Borrows One Million Yuan with Self-Owned Property as Security, to Fund Price Controls in Sanbei and the City

Shanghai business leader Yu Qiaqing's telegram reads: Respectfully to Chairman Jiang and Executive Directors Kong, Song, and Qian of the Chongqing Joint Office of the Four Banks, my hometown of Sanbei relies entirely on cotton for agricultural production, and its food relies on external supply. Last year, in order to obey government orders, cotton production was purchased by the Agricultural Bank at a low price, and the farmers' economy has become extremely depressed. Food prices have also reached more than 40 yuan per stone due to control and transportation difficulties, which is unsustainable and will lead to starvation. In addition to sending a separate telegram requesting government relief, we have decided to urgently advance funds to purchase foreign rice and transport it back to our hometown to carry out price controls. The Shanghai Price Control Committee has also been assisted by donations from enthusiastic people in various industries and sectors, which has lasted for three months. Judging from the current situation, it is impossible not to continue to do so. Since Sanbei is concerned with hometown feelings, and Shanghai is involved in leading the association's affairs, we cannot shirk our responsibility. A total of two million yuan in working capital is required for both locations to make ends meet. Although we have received assistance from fellow villagers and enthusiastic people, we are still short of half of that. After repeated consideration, we plan to borrow one million yuan from local banks and firms using the Shanghai prime real estate self-owned by Hode, valued at 1.5 million yuan, as security to fund price controls in both locations, for a period of six months. After contacting them, given that this matter is a righteous act and there is collateral to guarantee it, the various banks and firms have collectively decided to provide half of the amount. There is still a shortage of 500,000 yuan. We plan to ask the Four Banks to undertake this, and hereby submit this special telegram. We earnestly request that you instruct the Shanghai branch of the Four Banks to jointly accept the mortgage funds so that we can achieve our goal. We are eagerly awaiting your instructions, Yu Hede respectfully.

### Taxi Fares to Increase Today

Four major taxi companies in the city, Yunfei, Xiang Shengtai, and Silver, have agreed to revise taxi fares starting today (the 13th). The fare will be 2.7 yuan per 20 minutes, excluding the driver's tip.

### Shipping Companies Charter Vessels from Hong Kong, Jiangning Arrives in Shanghai

Since some British vessels in Shanghai were ordered to be slightly adjusted, the number of ships has gradually decreased, causing shipping companies to charter ships from Hong Kong recently to sail to Shanghai. It is reported that the British vessel Jiangning has obtained permission from the Hong Kong authorities to be chartered by shipping companies in Shanghai and will arrive in Shanghai from Hong Kong within days.

### Japan Repeats Propaganda of Opening the Yangtze River, Still Unreliable

The Da Zhong News Agency reports that a spokesperson for the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated a few days ago (the 10th), "The Japanese authorities in China have taken measures to accelerate the reopening of the Yangtze River." A reporter from the Da Zhong News Agency recently met with an economist in the city and asked for his views on the matter. According to his statement, after the National Army withdrew to the west, the ports along the Yangtze River were occupied by the Japanese army. Under the pretext of dangerous navigation and preventing third countries from supplying guerrillas, they blockaded the Yangtze River, prohibiting third-country ships from navigating and goods from being imported. All trade was monopolized by the Japanese. Because the customs offices in the Yangtze River ports have been closed, Japanese goods can be imported without reporting and paying taxes, just like domestic trade in Japan. The gentleman also presented statistics published by China and Japan. According to Japanese statistics, Japanese goods worth 168 million yuan were transported to Central China last year, while according to Chinese customs records, Japanese goods imported into Central China were only worth 81 million yuan. This shows that at least half of the Japanese goods in Central China are not reported and taxed. At present, Japanese goods are flooded in Zhenjiang, Nanjing, Wuhu, Jiujiang, Suzhou, Hangzhou and other ports, and the customs offices in these places have been closed for a long time, and Japanese goods are freely imported. This is the main reason why the Japanese have been reluctant to open the Yangtze River, and it is also one of the reasons why European and American countries have accused Japan of excluding the interests of third countries.

### International Settlement Volunteer Corps to Hold Review Tomorrow, Chairman Fankling to Serve as Reviewing Officer, Commander Osape Resigns

Tomorrow is the date for the annual review of the Shanghai International Settlement Volunteer Corps. Chairman Fankling of the Municipal Council, who is about to leave office, will serve as the reviewing commander, and the commander of the International Settlement Volunteer Corps will serve as the commanding officer. The review will take place at the racecourse baseball field at 3:00 PM tomorrow.

Traffic Changes

The Municipal Council, with its annual review approaching, has sent invitations to senior officials of the embassies and consulates of various countries in Shanghai, as well as generals of the defense forces of various countries stationed in Shanghai, and Chinese and foreign directors of the Municipal Council to attend and participate in the exercise. On this day, traffic has also been slightly altered by the police department. The intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Mache Road will be closed to traffic, and all vehicles will travel west on Baker Road. The intersections between Baker Road, Pike Road, Macbeth Road and Mache Road will be temporarily closed to traffic. Parking is not allowed between Jing'an Temple Road and Mache Road, but only on Qinghai Road. Other areas such as the west of Chengdu Road, the east of Jing'an Temple, and the north of the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Chengdu Road also have parking regulations.

Participating Units

The units of various countries participating in the review include: (A) the cavalry, including the light cavalry and the American troops stationed in Shanghai; (B) the combined team, including the interpreter team, armored vehicle team, Chinese team, engineering team, machine gun team, transportation and signal team; (C) A Company, including the Scottish A and B teams, air defense team, Jewish team; (D) B Company, including the Philippine team, American team, Portuguese team, American machine gun team; (E) C Company, including the 3rd volunteer company. The total number of participants in the review is 3,000. Commander Hongbai of the Volunteer Corps will lead the procession. The review will proceed from Mache Road to Jing'an Temple Road and end at the clubhouse at Xieqiao. Volunteer Corps vehicles will enter through the dragon gate entrance of the racecourse, park on the west side of the entrance, and traffic will be directed by police officers on Tongfu Road and Mache Road.

Farewell to Mr. Osape

Commander Osape of the Volunteer Corps joined the Volunteer Corps in 1898 and has been in office for 42 years. He then served as commander of A Company. He has now completed his term and submitted his resignation this year. Commander Hongbai, Fankling, Wilson, and other senior officials recognized Mr. Osape's outstanding contributions during his tenure. Therefore, a farewell party was held for Mr. Osape at the headquarters of the International Settlement Volunteer Corps on Wednesday evening. In addition, Captain Haskins of the General Staff Headquarters and Captain Brege of the A Company Headquarters resigned in January and this month, respectively.

### French Defense Forces Conduct Review This Morning

The French-language Shanghai Daily News reports that Senior Commander Gasville has been recalled to France for a new assignment. He will be replaced by Colonel Aesoti. Mr. Aesoti and his wife arrived in Shanghai on Sunday (the 7th). Colonel Gasville, the commanders of the Apodic and Fapo Companies, and officials from the French Command in China and the Staff Department personally welcomed them at the pier. On Monday (the 8th), the French Bridge Volunteer Team in China hosted a banquet for the new and old commanders and French military officers at the French General Association on Mayershi Road.

Regarding the ethnic minorities in the remote areas of southwestern China, such as the Yao, Man, and Zhuang peoples, although their cultures are backward, people have often been disparaging them based on their lifestyle habits, which is not in accordance with the principle of equality.

(2) For the convenience of academic research, the Secretariat of the Central Committee should be requested to send a letter to the Academia Sinica, detailing the following rules for revision. The principles for ethnic minorities in the southwest are as follows: A, All radicals involving insects, animals, or birds should be changed to the human radical; B, For those who do not apply to the first principle, homophones should be used, such as Man, Yao, and Dong. (3) The names of ethnic minorities, which are adjectives based on their living habits, should be abolished. A joint order has now been issued to the provincial governments to instruct educational institutions to comply.

People were rejoicing that rice prices could be lowered, but unexpectedly, the price of gold soared a few days ago, making the cost of imported rice prohibitive, and prices rose again. Although two to three thousand bags of domestic rice arrive daily, and it is reported that Dachang Company in Hongkou has already prepared over 40,000 bags of goods in Xichang and other areas, which will also arrive in Shanghai successively, the rice market has not been affected by this at all. Instead, prices have risen by half a yuan to nearly a yuan. This is because everyone tightens their grip as soon as the market opens in the morning, and customers from various groups continue to buy steadily without retreating, creating a good opportunity for merchants to push prices up. Once there is demand, prices rise repeatedly, and floating speculators seize the opportunity to buy low and sell high, which is especially exhilarating. The prices of imported rice have returned to their levels before the price drop. Annam rice is 44 yuan, Saigon No. 1 is 43.5 yuan, Huojiao is 42 yuan, and Xiaojiao is 39.5 yuan. For domestic rice, only very old or water-damaged rice is still traded at normal prices. Sutung water-damaged japonica rice and old Nangang early rice are sold for 40 yuan. The better quality rice has disappeared from the market, and there are many off-market deals. It is said that Changxi Gaote japonica rice is sold for 44.5 yuan, Zhongguan is 43.5 yuan, Changzhou Zhongjing is 41.7 yuan, Kunshan white japonica rice is 42-3 yuan, Qingsi Tebo is 42-3 yuan, and Nangang original package early and late rice is 41-2 yuan. The price of glutinous rice has also increased by 5-6 jiao. However, although the prices of various types of rice continue to rise in the market, it is not easy to raise them sharply, because the supply of domestic rice is smooth and unhindered, imported rice continues to arrive, and the amount of rice stored in Shanghai warehouses is very large. According to industry insiders, the total amount of rice stored in warehouses inside and outside the concession is no less than 1.5 to 1.6 million bags, which is enough to feed the city's residents for four to five months. Therefore, although sales are wide, there is no shortage in the short term. Moreover, scarcity makes goods valuable, while abundance makes them cheap. This is a fixed principle. How can rice prices still rise sharply like before? This current wave of price increases is likely just a turnaround in the market and a necessary change. Yesterday, the entire city rose from the initial wait-and-see to the mid-market high, and then hovered without being able to climb further. The market closed with an increase of only half a yuan to nearly a yuan.

The price of imported rice fluctuates greatly due to international changes and people's nervousness, as well as rumors in the market. However, due to the persistence of the suppliers and the activity of new speculators, as well as the impact of insufficient ship space and high pricing, the market has gradually risen. The price of Saigon No. 2 for the April-May term once fell to 50.02 yuan in the morning, but rebounded in the afternoon, and the price increase was even more frenzied. As a result, the price rose to 51 yuan. The spot price also rose sharply from 49 yuan to 50 yuan. The spot price of Xiaojiao also rose to 48.6 yuan. The spot price was also sharp. The price of No. 1 rose to 43.5 yuan in the morning and then to 44 yuan in the afternoon. The price of Xiaojiao rose from around 39 yuan in the morning to 40 yuan in the afternoon, which was more than a yuan higher than the previous day. A total of 8,000 bags of spot rice and 350-60 tons of term rice were traded.

The price of imported rice and corn shipped north is very strong. Today, the Yihua Yongsheng Wheel exported to North China. In addition to 8,709 bags of imported rice loaded in Hong Kong and transported to Yanjin, another 500 bags were loaded in Shanghai and transported to Tianjin. The Taikoo Company's Shuntian Wheel also exported this afternoon, carrying 750 bags of imported rice and about 6,400 bags of corn to Tianjin. It is said that the corn is imported corn from Holland and Vietnam. The trade of flour and wheat is sluggish.

The flour market showed a pattern of initial stability followed by fatigue. The price of flour from the No. 2 flour factory was still 13.8 yuan. The price of old brand return cargo was reduced to 13.45 yuan in the morning. The asking price of Shuangshi brand was also above 13 yuan. Later, due to the sluggish actual effect and the emphasis of buyers, the old brand was only willing to enter the market at 4 jiao. Therefore, the two sides disagreed and there was no substantial transaction. However, according to news from the factory, the Beiyang gang sold 30,000 to 40,000 bags of lower-grade flour, and the market felt brighter. As for retail transactions on the street, the amount was only a few thousand bags. According to the current environment of the flour market, it is no longer comparable to the past. Sudden rises and falls may not have a significant impact.

The wheat market continued to be deadlocked. Both Chinese and Japanese factories did not officially sell. Buyers intended to suppress the price, while sellers wanted to defend it. However, it was heard that 100 bags of goods were sent to the factory the day before yesterday, and the price yesterday was only 21.5 yuan, which was half a yuan lower than the previous price. There was no news of other transactions. This kind of environment is unlikely to be optimistic. Medicinal Materials, Chaozhi Continues to Rise by 5 Yuan

Although there have been recent arrivals of Chaozhi, the quantity is small, so the base is very thin. However, the demand from all sides is frequent, so the situation is quite good. For example, more than 20 pieces were traded a few days ago, and the price was 8,000 yuan, which was 5 yuan higher than before. Finance: Buying and Selling Hesitant, Exchange Rate Fluctuations Are Still Slight.

The sharp rise in the exchange rate between the US dollar and the British pound was as much as 0.0675 yuan, resulting in a flat US dollar and a flat British pound. However, throughout the day, due to numerous rumors and difficulty in determining the truth of the news, speculators had little real direction in buying and selling, so the impact was small. In the early morning, the US dollar was quoted at over 6.125 yuan, but later, foreign news came that more countries were bound to be drawn into the vortex of the European war, and the exchange rate was expected to fall, so there were more short sellers and the price fell back. The afternoon started mediocre with few transactions. In the middle of the day, only the exchange rate between the US dollar and the British pound for this month was traded at 3.52875 yuan.

Speculators saw the opportunity to stop and switch to short selling. At that time, it was also reported that a certain senior army official in France told the people that the expansion of the war was inevitable. As a result, people's minds were still short on the exchange rate, demand increased, and the price became soft. Chinese merchants bought the May US dollar at 5.8125 yuan from the US bank.

The Tomb of Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai

Twenty miles west of Ningbo City, there is a place called Shaojiadu. The south of it is Yin County, and the north is Ci County, using this river as the boundary between the two counties. On the other bank, there is the Liangjun Temple, and behind the temple is the tomb of Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai. According to legend, during the Jin Dynasty, Liang Shanbo, whose courtesy name was Churen, was from Kuaiji. He studied in the same school as Zhu Yingtai for three years. When Shanbo visited her, he realized she was a woman. He returned to tell his parents and asked for her hand in marriage, but Zhu had already been promised to the Ma family in Shengcheng. When Shanbo became the magistrate, he fell ill and died, leaving instructions to be buried in Sishi Qingdaoyuan. The following year, when Zhu married into the Ma family, her boat passed by Shanbo's tomb. Overcome by the wind, Yingtai went ashore and wailed at the tomb. The ground cracked and she fell in. When the matter was reported to the court, Prime Minister Xie An of the time奏封義婦塚, now the crack in the stone bar in front of the tomb still looks like something from thousands of years ago. Although this story is close to allegory, the record is solid and verifiable, so there may be some truth to it. On the fifteenth day of the second month of this year, the statue was consecrated, and on the first day of the third month, a play was performed to appease the gods. It is also said that the god specializes in progeny, so those who seek children are most likely to have their wishes fulfilled. It is now known that seeking wealth, sailing the seas, taking exams, and all trivial matters can be promised. Reciting a certain number of Lotus Sutras, each costing 72 Wen. Villagers do not use foreign money. Those who promise to recite 100 Lotus Sutras must carry 7,200 Wen in white square coins into the temple to fulfill their vows. This year, the incense is the most prosperous. Those who live in the temple are neither monks nor Taoists nor nuns. It is undertaken by several local families, allocated according to shares, like ancestral property. Every year, the soil on the tomb is dug up and taken home by those who burn incense, saying that it can cure bedbugs, ants, mudfish, flies, etc. Therefore, every year in September, the cost of repairing the tomb and adding soil is drawn from the income from incense. Villagers, couples, officials, and people from other prefectures and counties all write letters. It is said that last year, after deducting all expenses, the temple keeper made a large profit.
