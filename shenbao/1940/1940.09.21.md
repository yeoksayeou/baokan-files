### Japan Puts Forward New Demands; Vietnamese Governor-General Decoux Rejects Them; Japan Issues Ultimatum, Giving France Three Days to Respond; Negotiations Break Down, Situation in Vietnam Extremely Tense

Hong Kong: According to well-informed sources, French-Japanese negotiations on Vietnam have broken down, and the situation is extremely serious. (20th Dispatch)

Hong Kong: According to well-informed sources here, negotiations between the French authorities and the Japanese inspection team in Hanoi have completely broken down, and the situation in Vietnam is very critical. It is reported that the breakdown of the negotiations was brought about because, after the two sides agreed to allow the Japanese army (reportedly 25,000 troops) to pass through Vietnam to the border of Yunnan Province, the Japanese army made further demands. Vietnamese Governor-General Decoux has rejected these subsequent demands. It is said that the content concerns various bases outside the scope of the Vichy agreement and is considered unnecessary for Japan's military operations against China. Japanese expatriates in Hanoi are reportedly preparing to evacuate to Haiphong, where a Japanese ship is waiting. (20th Reuters Dispatch)

Chongqing: Authoritative government sources here are paying close attention to reports from Hanoi that Major General Nishihara, the leader of the Japanese delegation, has delivered a second ultimatum to the French authorities. For the past two days, wireless communications between Chongqing and Kunming have been busy, as key officials in these two cities are exchanging views and information on steps to be taken in response to the situation in Vietnam. Most political circles believe that the rapid turn of events in Hanoi may occur within a few days, and they anticipate that France will adopt a stronger stance. (20th United Press Dispatch)

Hong Kong: According to authoritative sources, Japan has issued an ultimatum to Vietnam, giving them 72 hours to respond, with the deadline expiring at midnight on September 22nd. However, this information has not yet been confirmed by official channels. (20th Reuters Dispatch)

Hong Kong: Although there are as-yet-unverified reports from Guangzhou Bay that personnel from the Japanese consulate and the Japanese monitoring team have been ordered to withdraw from Hanoi today, it is now reported that negotiations between Vietnamese Governor-General Decoux and Japanese representative Nishihara have reached an agreement, allowing 25,000 Japanese soldiers and military supplies to land in Haiphong in order to pass through Vietnam to the Yunnan border. Japanese Consul-General in Hong Kong, Okazaki, stated that he has not received any information regarding departures. It is also reported that the French authorities have prepared special trains for the Japanese to use to transport them to Haiphong. A Japanese warship is currently waiting in Haiphong. (20th Reuters Dispatch)

Hong Kong: News from Guangxi states that if the Japanese military's landing in Vietnam is stalled, it will be greatly detrimental to their plans to attack Yunnan. According to news from Shuikouguan, no Japanese troops have entered Vietnam through the Guangxi-Vietnam border. Sources in Chinese military circles here report that the Chinese army in Yunnan and Guangxi is currently monitoring the Japanese forces at Zhennanguan and Longzhou. It is also said that the Japanese commander in Guangxi, in light of the increasing possibility of cooperation between Britain and the United States in the Far East, dares not rashly send troops into Vietnam. However, every day the Japanese army is stalled, British-American cooperation gets closer. Reports on the Japanese troop strength on the Vietnamese border vary, according to news reports from Hanoi, Vichy, and Tokyo. According to Chinese sources in Beihai, there are four Japanese divisions stationed in Qinzhou County, Hainan, and the Hunzhou Islands, totaling 100,000 troops. It is said that in the event of a conflict, these 100,000 troops would be transported by sea to Haiphong, while the Japanese forces at Zhennanguan would move west towards Tang Dang (transliteration). North of Guangzhou and the Dongjiang area have been quiet for the past two weeks due to the Japanese troops being moved to Guangxi, Hainan, and the Hunzhou Islands. The main battles in South China are currently taking place in Shangsi County, between Nanning, Longzhou. (20th International News Agency Dispatch)

Tokyo: Today, Foreign Ministry spokesman Suma told reporters that although negotiations between the Japanese and French authorities in Hanoi have not yet reached an understanding, they are progressing smoothly. When asked whether Japanese troops had landed anywhere in Vietnam, the spokesman solemnly replied that he could confidently say that Japanese troops had not landed in Vietnam, and that Japan did not need to send troops to land before reaching an understanding with the Vietnamese authorities. The spokesman also stated that reports in the foreign press of clashes between Chinese and French forces near the Vietnamese border have not been confirmed by official reports. (20th Reuters Dispatch)

Hanoi: Since the Japanese side presented a new ultimatum to the French authorities last night, Japanese expatriates and personnel from the Japanese military delegation have hurriedly evacuated Hanoi, causing the situation in Annam to be exceptionally tense today. According to French officials, the Japanese side presented the French last night with new demands that the Vichy government would find difficult to accept. Well-informed sources also revealed that the new demands made by the Japanese side were presented entirely in the form of an ultimatum, reportedly with a deadline of midnight this Saturday. (20th United Press Dispatch)

Hanoi: Much attention is being paid here to the movements of six French warships. These warships began this week to pass through the Strait of Gibraltar with British permission. Some believe that these warships are unlikely to arrive quickly enough to cope with the current tense situation, but their destination is undoubtedly Annam. Annam officials apparently decided last night to reject the Japanese ultimatum, and the French army stationed in Annam is also prepared to resist any invading Japanese. It is widely believed that if the French resolutely reject Japan's demands before the ultimatum deadline expires, Japan may launch a joint land and sea invasion of Annam. The Japanese army in Guangdong has already concentrated a large number of troops on the Annam border, and the Japanese navy is concentrated on the waters off Annam. Some are convinced that Japan's new demands, in addition to special economic interests, mainly concern permanent naval and air bases in Annam. As for Japan's previous request to pass through Annam, it was merely a smokescreen for the new demands mentioned above. (20th Reuters Dispatch)

Tokyo: According to the "Yomiuri Shimbun," the Thai government has denied reports of Thai troops invading Vietnam and Thai aircraft flying into Vietnamese airspace. (20th Haitong Dispatch)

### Nishihara Issues Warning, Says Situation Will Worsen

Hanoi: Major General Nishihara, the leader of the Japanese delegation, recently issued a warning, stating that the Japanese ultimatum will expire on Sunday evening. If French-Japanese negotiations completely break down, the situation will become even worse, and he is prepared to leave Haiphong for Tokyo. Nishihara said that the evacuation of Japanese nationals today does not mean that a real crisis has arrived. He also stated that he is prepared to leave Hanoi today. If the negotiations reach a point that "I consider hopeless, then I will return to Tokyo." What steps the Japanese will take if France rejects Japan's demands will be decided in Tokyo. There is now a time limit on the response to the demands. Nishihara also denied that the new demands were outside the scope of the Vichy-Tokyo agreement, stating that the Japanese delegation is acting strictly in accordance with the Vichy-Tokyo agreement. Nishihara accused France of adopting delaying tactics, saying that the Tokyo agreement was signed three weeks ago, but the French side has not yet fulfilled its obligations under the agreement. Nishihara also accused the French side of ignoring Japan's proposals. According to an official announcement here, French-Japanese negotiations are still underway, but France is unlikely to accept any demands that go beyond the scope of the Vichy-Tokyo agreement. The situation in Vietnam is currently quite critical, but also very chaotic, because Japan's new demands have not been announced. However, it is said that they are the same as the demands of September 2nd. Major General Nishihara, when asked by reporters about U.S. Secretary of State Hull's recent statement that the U.S. is very concerned about the current situation in Vietnam, replied that the current situation in Vietnam is not threatened and that the territorial integrity of Vietnam is not endangered. Nishihara also understands that the current relationship between France and Japan is similar to the current cooperation between Britain and the United States. Although Japanese expatriates are withdrawing from Hanoi to Haiphong, the Japanese still maintain a sense of self-restraint. This sense of self-restraint is reflected in the actions of the Japanese delegation personnel, who are paying hotel waiters and bartenders in Japanese yen, saying that Japanese currency cannot be used in Vietnam. Major General Nishihara met with American reporters at the heavily guarded headquarters of the Japanese delegation, which is located inside a government building. Nishihara stressed that the Japanese have very friendly feelings towards the French and that the Japanese have no intention of hating the French. 147 Japanese expatriates here, including some members of the delegation, sang the Japanese national anthem this morning and boarded special trains to Haiphong. When the Japanese gathered on the station platform and sang the Japanese national anthem, French and Annamese people stood and watched continuously. As for the other senior Japanese delegation officials, it is reported that they will travel to Haiphong by car this afternoon. (20th United Press Dispatch)

### Japanese Expatriates Rush to Evacuate; Negotiations Enter Delicate Stage

Hanoi: Negotiations between France and Japan over Japan's demands on Annam had almost reached the point of rupture as of last night. According to a French official report, after Japan put forward new demands that were "greatly at odds with the instructions of the Vichy government and completely deviated from the normal track of the French-Japanese agreement," the negotiations had suddenly turned into a "weak state." Although the French official report stated that negotiations were still continuing, Japan was apparently preparing for the breakdown of negotiations. Last night, 400 Japanese expatriates received orders to evacuate Annam urgently, at the latest by today. Most Japanese have already taken special trains from Hanoi to Haiphong this morning. 4.5 tons of luggage was transported to Haiphong last night. It is said that three Japanese warships are pre-stationed there, specifically for the evacuation of Japanese expatriates. It is reported that these ships were ordered to come and must wait for the evacuating Japanese expatriates to board before they can set sail after receiving orders. Personnel from the Japanese military delegation also announced that they were preparing to leave Hanoi, but delegation leader Nishihara would remain here for a few more days before leaving. Last night, Mr. Nishihara visited Vietnamese Governor-General Decoux and his wife. It is widely believed that this visit was really a "farewell" visit. (20th Taiwan Mass Press Dispatch)

Hanoi: Japanese consuls in various parts of Vietnam are preparing for their country's expatriates to board ships and evacuate. This measure is initially not based on concrete facts, but the Governor-General of Vietnam has provided various conveniences. It is now known that the Japanese delegation has put forward new demands, the nature of which seems to have exceeded the scope of the agreement in principle between France and Japan and is difficult to reconcile with the instructions received by the Vietnamese authorities. For this reason, it has entered a delicate stage. The two sides are currently continuing discussions. (20th Havas Dispatch)

Haiphong: According to French official sources, negotiations between France and Japan in Hanoi have reached a "delicate" stage. It is reported that the Japanese side has demanded the establishment of bases, a demand that is not within the scope of the Vichy Agreement and is unrelated to the war against China. All Japanese expatriates in Vietnam are now ostensibly gathered in one place, preparing to evacuate. A special train will depart from Hanoi to Haiphong today, specially carrying Japanese expatriates. However, the Japanese authorities have not yet issued an evacuation order. According to a Japanese army spokesman, negotiations are still underway and we remain optimistic about reaching a satisfactory conclusion. (20th Reuters Dispatch)

### French Foreign Minister Tells U.S. Will Allow Japanese Troops to Pass Through

New York: French Foreign Minister Baudouin told U.S. reporters in Vichy yesterday that France would accept Japan's request to send troops through Vietnam. France cannot expect the assistance of Britain and the United States, so the Pétain government must adopt a realistic policy to protect French colonies. (20th Reuters Dispatch)

Vichy: Today, French Foreign Minister Baudouin, when meeting with representatives of the U.S. press, stated that France had recently accepted something unexpected and had to succumb to Japan's request to pass through Vietnam. Baudouin said that France could not hope for the assistance of Britain and the United States, and therefore had to follow a realistic policy to protect the country's security. "France is currently negotiating alone with the Japanese." Baudouin's remarks contradict rumors that Germany is directing the Vichy government on the Vietnam issue. Baudouin also said that the Japanese government made a request to pass through Vietnam as early as June 13th. This was the day that General Weygand requested an armistice from Germany and Italy. Lieutenant General Decoux, the Governor-General of Vietnam, was conducting negotiations with the Japanese side, but the Japanese side expressed dissatisfaction and made new demands on August 2nd. Baudouin said that although the French were under the threat of Japanese military occupation, they rejected negotiations on the new demands made by the Japanese side because the Japanese demands at that time were extremely unreasonable. He said, "We recognize that Japan is the strongest country in the Far East. We intend to follow a realistic policy to protect France's interests and unity. We have notified the U.S. government of the progress of the negotiations from the beginning. Vietnam still exists under the influence of the British government in the Far East, but we must act alone, because we cannot hope for more than diplomatic assistance from Britain and the United States. (20th International News Agency Dispatch)

Washington: Although newspapers in major cities on the East Coast have published special news reports stating that France has decided to allow Japanese troops to pass through Vietnam, Secretary of State Hull declared late yesterday that he had not yet received official confirmation of the matter. Hull added that the United States firmly opposes Japanese aggression against Vietnam. This policy of the United States is known to the world. As for the rumors that France has decided to allow Japanese troops to enter Vietnam, he is still waiting for official confirmation. Continued on page 4

### The Origins and Destinations of Legal Tender

Rumors have been circulating in the Shanghai market that a large amount of new banknotes has been shipped from the United States and Britain to Chongqing, leading to all sorts of misinformation. Speculators are gleefully spreading the word that this is evidence of inflation, a harbinger of rising prices, and a clear sign that the foundation of legal tender is weakening. Their aim is to stir up trouble and create opportunities for profit. However, this is extremely naive. If their claims were true, would the legal tender they deceitfully acquire still hold any value? If they are not naive, then there must be other motives behind their actions. However, in today's world, where everything is in ruins and economic activities are severely restricted, can they be sure of benefiting from their actions? This is something that even those with a little common sense can understand. It is important to recognize that legal tender is currently the only currency in China and the lifeline of the Chinese economy. Those who speak of inflation do not understand the vastness of China and its large population, nor do they understand the complex financial system of old China, the variety of currencies, and the centralization of silver dollars after the circulation of legal tender. Legal tender has its own inherent expansiveness. To simply grasp a superficial understanding and misuse terminology, claiming that the circulation of new banknotes equates to inflation and impacts prices, demonstrates a failure to understand the matter. This is akin to strumming a lute without understanding the keys. Their aim is to create chaos and sabotage through insidious plots.

During the process of currency unification, the increase in the issuance of legal tender is a necessary adjustment to factual needs, not comparable to situations where the currency system has long been unified, issuance has long been centralized, and the issuance of paper money suddenly expands to meet fiscal needs. Leaving aside the fact that the increase in the issuance of Chinese legal tender is an appropriate move, even if we concede that today's rising prices are a result of the increased issuance of legal tender, or that the increased issuance of legal tender is itself influenced by rising prices and the inadequacy of small denominations, it is not difficult to determine this by comparing the development rates of the two. When measured against prices, the rate of increase is often five to six times higher than before the war, but the increase in the issuance of legal tender has not been so huge or rapid. Furthermore, when compared to the large total population of China and the destruction of old currencies and banknotes, it is clear that legal tender alone is far from sufficient as a medium of exchange. Moreover, the Central Bank of China and the Farmers Bank of China are publicly handling the gradual recall of old banknotes. Therefore, exchanging old for new to facilitate transactions is also an inevitable path for issuing new banknotes. To not consider this and blindly focus on the increase in new banknotes, claiming it to be inflation, is unreasonable. Inflation, after all, is a comparative term. More now than before is inflation, less now than before is contraction. The degree of inflation and contraction each has its own measure. Only when it exceeds this naturally expected measure, whether it be more or less, can inflation and contraction be said to exist. As for the soaring prices of today, it is due to (1) the extensive destruction of agricultural and industrial enterprises in the occupied areas, leading to reduced production. Even when there is production, it is subject to extortion and outflow. (2) There are those who attack the foreign exchange market, causing the Chinese authorities to abandon their policy of maintaining it, allowing the black market to grow and fall on its own, ultimately leading to a shortage due to the failure to adjust supply and demand, hence the high prices. (3) Coastal transportation is often blockaded, disrupting freight transportation, and naturally causing price fluctuations. (4) Then there is the "control" in the occupied areas, clever extortion and plunder, so that the producers suffer huge losses, which they have to recoup through the prices of goods sold freely, so prices cannot but be high. These are the major factors. Moreover, due to the high prices, small denomination currencies are inconvenient for transactions and have to be replaced with higher denomination currencies. This can be seen in the recent trend of rising retail prices, the decreasing need for one-cent coins, and the gradual trend of using five cents as the retail unit. Therefore, the progression of paper money from one yuan to five yuan, ten yuan, and even fifty yuan or one hundred yuan, is necessary given the current situation. Moreover, the banknotes printed this time are intended to "alleviate the panic over the lack of banknotes in free China." If the "lack" is so great as to cause "panic," it is clear that there is an excess deficit. To "supplement" what is "insufficient" through the issuance of new banknotes is not comparable to inflation. Moreover, how could it flow into the occupied areas, making their inflammatory rhetoric even more misleading?

How could free China face a shortage of banknotes leading to panic? One can assume that it is due to the smooth implementation of legal tender, such as in Sichuan, Yunnan, Kang, and Tibet, where silver was previously used, but now legal tender is used, and the demand for legal tender has naturally increased. Secondly, private funds are fleeing abroad, which is undeniable in today's unstable situation. The result of this flight is bound to lead to a situation where the circulation of legal tender is abundant in some places and deficient in others. For example, Shanghai is a central point for fleeing funds from home and abroad, resulting in an oversupply of floating capital, rampant speculation, and promoting rising prices. Therefore, to ultimately prevent inflation, it is not difficult to do so by (1) moving banknotes from places with an excess of banknotes to places with a shortage of banknotes, leveling the playing field. (2) Lowering the interest rate on current deposits and raising the interest rate on fixed savings deposits, so that floating capital can be used for legitimate purposes through the hands of the financial sector. (3) Buying and selling new and old public bonds, which not only offer generous benefits but also have government guarantees, eliminating the risk of speculation. Indeed, today, the chances of failure for those who speculate in commodities are greater than the chances of success, unlike last year. (4) Form a syndicate or corporate investment group to undertake planned development projects in the interior, soliciting investment from all sectors, with the government guaranteeing interest. All of these measures will channel floating capital into legitimate uses, which is also a strategy to curb the loose and chaotic market and suppress speculation. In fact, a State Department official pointed out that the Secretary of State had issued three diplomatic warnings to Tokyo regarding disturbances to the territorial status quo in the Far East. No matter where Japan invades, it is contrary to the views of the United States. (20th International News Agency Dispatch)

### Tokyo Opens Imperial Conference; Content Kept Absolutely Secret

Tokyo: Cabinet ministers and heads of the Navy and Army met in the Imperial Palace yesterday for an Imperial Conference, which lasted three hours. The Chief Cabinet Secretary then issued a communiqué, stating that important state affairs were discussed. Those in attendance included the Prime Minister, Minister of the Navy, Minister of the Army, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Minister of Finance, the Chiefs and Deputy Chiefs of Staff of the Army and Navy, and the Director of the Planning Board. (20th Reuters Dispatch)

Tokyo: The Japanese government today maintained absolute secrecy regarding its attitude towards Vietnam and prohibited domestic newspapers from publishing any information regarding Japan's ultimatum to Vietnam. Japanese newspapers attached great importance to the news of the Imperial Conference, but currently no newspaper openly speculates on the details of the meeting. Government officials refused to confirm reports that Japan had sent an ultimatum to Vietnam. It is rumored that the sending of the ultimatum was the result of the Imperial Conference, which was attended by the Emperor himself. Other officials who attended the meeting included Prime Minister Konoe and the heads of the Navy and Army. For two weeks, Japanese newspapers have refrained from publishing details of the French-Japanese negotiations in Hanoi, so the Japanese people today are still unaware that the French-Japanese negotiations have broken down and that Japanese expatriates in Vietnam are beginning to evacuate. Most of the news about Vietnam published in Japanese newspapers is "educational" in nature, with the sole intention of giving the Japanese general public the impression that "Vietnam is very important to Japan."

It is also understood that: (1) For goods subject to the sales ban, if the owner declares they are for personal use, the inspection authorities may, after verification, open the original packaging as appropriate to ensure that they cannot be resold. During transit, only quantities that are scattered with opened packaging and verified by the inspection authorities for personal use are permitted, in order to meet the intent of the sales ban; (2) The purchase price of foreign goods subject to the sales ban will generally be based on the import price at the first port of entry, plus the applicable customs duties, as the basic figure for calculation; (3) The purchase price of Shanghai and Hong Kong-made cigarettes subject to the sales ban will generally be based on the registered price reported by the tobacco company to the Tax Bureau, plus the applicable consolidated tax, as the basic figure for calculation.

### United States Closely Watching Developments in the Far East Situation; US, UK, and Australia Discuss Pacific Joint Defense; Use of Singapore Naval Base for Information Exchange

Washington: Well-informed sources here expressed concern about the negotiations between U.S. Secretary of State Hull, British Ambassador to the U.S. Lord Lothian, and Australian Minister to the U.S. Casey, deeply worried that the situation in the Far East may undergo a decisive change due to the Japanese army's entry into Vietnam. According to sources in Hanoi, negotiations between Japan and the Vietnamese authorities are nearing completion. U.S. officials believe that the U.S. will draw conclusions from this development, but the State Department claims that there is no affiliation with Japan's attempt to reorganize the status quo in the Far East. It is generally expected that the U.S. and Australia are conducting negotiations, preparing for the U.S. team to protect Australia, or will simultaneously protect Singapore, at least temporarily. The withdrawal of the U.S. fleet from Hawaii to the Pacific coast appears to be a sign of easing tensions, but in reality, it is a strategy by the U.S. Navy to enhance the efficiency of the Pacific Fleet in preparation for developments in the situation. (20th Haitong dispatch)

Washington: Secretary of State Hull announced yesterday that the governments of the United States, Britain, and Australia have recently exchanged information on the joint use of the British naval base in Singapore by the four countries of Britain, the United States, the Netherlands, and France.

Hull continued, "There was no discussion of proposals other than the usual exchange of information." He said, "The joint use of the Singapore naval base is still being sought to reach a definitive decision, and a formal request has not yet been submitted." (20th United Press dispatch)

London: It has been confirmed here that U.S. Secretary of State Hull, British Ambassador Lothian, and Australian Minister Casey are currently conducting talks in Washington. It is reported that the events discussed include methods of defense for the Pacific. (20th Reuters dispatch)

Those participating in this discussion are Secretary of State Hull, British Ambassador to the U.S. Lothian, and Australian Minister Casey. Hull also declared in Washington yesterday that information has already been exchanged regarding the United States' use of the British naval base in Singapore. (20th United Press dispatch)

New York: Former commander of the U.S. Far East Fleet, Rear Admiral Yarnell, strongly stated yesterday that the United States should adopt an offensive policy to protect its interests in Asia. Yarnell said, "Withdrawing from the Far East is an impossible policy for the United States." He further said that the U.S. government should immediately sign a joint agreement with Britain, the Netherlands, and France to jointly protect mutual interests in the East. The United States should also seek new bases in the Pacific and strengthen its Far East Fleet, "using Singapore as a fleet base, assisting China in every possible way, and stopping the transport of military raw materials to Japan." Yarnell made these three points in his powerful speech. Yarnell also condemned Japan for not destroying American commerce in China, not bombing American people and property, not violating American treaty rights, and not ignoring American protests. (20th International dispatch)

Washington: Rear Admiral Yarnell suggested that the United States should adopt an offensive policy in the Pacific in order to protect American interests in Asia. Secretary of State Hull declined to comment on this suggestion, saying that he had no immediate opportunity to discuss the Far East issue with Yarnell. (20th International dispatch)

### US Secretary of War Strenuously Advocates Strengthening External Defense Lines

Washington: Secretary of War Stimson declared yesterday while hosting reporters that the United States should immediately strengthen its external defense lines. He said that because the defense money has already been lost and the British navy has begun to be shaken again, the United States must strengthen its external defense lines. The so-called external defense lines are obtained from British bases, which are all for naval use, but can also be used for combined land and sea operations. Once the survey of the valley is completed, the defense procedure will begin immediately. As for the construction of the southern base to defend the Panama Canal, diplomatic efforts are already underway. If someone approaches the area and launches an attack, the army and navy should resist. Stimson indicated that the United States' military plans have no intention of starting a war. He said, "We are seeking to prevent war." It was also specially stipulated at yesterday's meeting that Stimson's reception meetings every Thursday would be permitted only to reporters.

### German Air Force Continues Offensive Against England in Wind and Rain; London Air Raid Lasted Eleven Hours Last Night; German Aircraft Groups Invaded England Again Yesterday Morning

Dublin: Yesterday, German bombers, escorted by fighter planes, attacked London again, dropping several bombs, many of which were heavy. The bombing lasted almost all night, and the alert was only lifted shortly after 6:00 am this morning. Despite the wind and rain, enemy planes continued to fly blindly, randomly dropping bombs on the capital. Residential areas suffered the most damage again. Before dawn, enemy bombers dive-bombed northwest and east London. Central London also suffered heavy damage, but casualties were minimal. A German bomber was hit by anti-aircraft fire in southwest London and crashed, destroying a house. A hospital was almost affected. (20th Reuters dispatch)

London: German aircraft raided the entire city of London for eleven hours, lasting until 6:00 am this morning. This time, the Germans' brutal behavior towards London was unparalleled. German planes flew even lower than before, and explosive bombs and incendiary bombs fell like hail. Tall buildings in London, long-standing landmarks, large stores in the West End, and old markets all became victims. Entire streets in several residential areas were completely destroyed. However, the British continued to attack German-occupied ports across the Channel. (20th International dispatch)

London: Last night until this morning, German planes continuously dropped particularly heavy bombs indiscriminately over London, while also bombing other parts of England, including Lanarkshire, Essex, Surrey, Berkshire, Kent, the Midlands, and the Southwest. Although the number of casualties was not significant, the material losses were likely to be huge. Residential areas in central, northwest, and east London were severely damaged. This morning, a powerful German fleet of aircraft flew across the coast from the Belgian seaside towards London. After reaching English territory, the planes divided into three groups and invaded simultaneously. At the same time, British Spitfire fighters also appeared in the sky above the coast and intercepted them. Approximately two hundred German planes were eventually able to penetrate inland. An alert was issued in London just before the German planes arrived, but after a fierce interception by British Spitfire and Hurricane fighters, the German planes retreated in disarray, and the alert was quickly lifted. (20th Reuters dispatch)

London: Since the German side launched its sky offensive on September 7th, yesterday was the quietest day in London. However, as dusk fell, the German side launched the most extensive attack since the start of the war on England. Therefore, last night German bombers flew in batches over London and many other places. The German air force apparently began to implement the intimidation issued by German newspapers yesterday, which referred to the British planes bombing a mental asylum in Pesar and demanded retaliation. When London was attacked last night, the areas hit were quite wide. It was reported that a certain town in the southeast was also attacked, with five bombs causing considerable damage. Northwest England was also attacked, but the German planes flying to the northeast were not as frequent as in previous nights. Some German planes that attacked last night seemed to try to penetrate central London from the northwest along new routes. Anti-aircraft guns in the northwest fired fiercely. Before long, the enemy planes got closer, and anti-aircraft guns in central London also roared in unison. Enemy planes continued to fly to northwest London, and dozens of searchlights opened to search. Suddenly, the roar of British fighters was heard, and the searchlights immediately went out. The German planes immediately tried to evade, while the British planes increased their search and pursuit. At the beginning of this air raid, a bomb fell in a suburb of north London. London's anti-aircraft fire was as fierce as before. (20th Reuters dispatch)

London: A Reuters visitor stated that the lightning and thick black clouds in southeastern England caused the other side's large-scale aircraft to fail to move. The problem of how to exhaust Goering's large-scale plan was not solved, but only a small number of enemy aircraft came alone. Although the British aircraft attacked the enemy aircraft yesterday was quite difficult, they still achieved good results. Last night, the Department of Aviation issued a bulletin stating that there was no large-scale air combat report yesterday. Two enemy aircraft dropped bombs in several areas of eastern London, with slight losses in property and life. British aircraft intercepted the two enemy aircraft and shot down a total of one. It was heard that bombs also fell on coastal towns in Essex and Sussex and somewhere in western England, with minor injuries and deaths. British fighters intercepted most of the attacking enemy aircraft with bad vision and destroyed five enemy bombers. It is estimated that about three hundred and fifty enemy aircraft carried out "blind bombing" of London and other places in England on Wednesday night. (20th Reuters dispatch)

### German Aircraft Groups Invade London from the Northwest Suburbs and Drop Bombs

London: The fleet of planes of Head of State Hitler continued to bomb London last night, although the weather at the time was quite bad. However, aircraft groups still dropped huge amounts of bombs in various places in the city. The sound of anti-aircraft guns and the roar of aircraft were heard in the sky above London. German aircraft seemed to have adopted a new route to invade London, as they came from the northwest suburbs this time. The German planes were flying very low and were resisted by anti-aircraft guns everywhere. When the German planes flew to the center of the city, searchlights became very active. It was said that the bombs dropped by the German planes in the northern suburbs did not cause much damage to the city. Shortly after midnight, all the city's searchlights were completely extinguished. British planes then rose to engage. It was said that British fighters were searching everywhere for German planes under the moonlight. Thousands of London residents, ignoring the notices issued by the Ministry of Shipping and the Department of Security, still gathered at various stations last night for several hours before the air raid alert was issued. Last night, several German planes hovered over the city again, dropping five heavy bombs. Houses, shops, and all buildings within a mile were destroyed. It was said that the Southeastern Baptist Church, the former service personnel club, and the fire station were all hit. Also, the industrial area in the northwest of the city was also destroyed. Three bombs landed on a small factory. A spokesman for the Department of Domestic Security reported to the press last night that the German air force's attacks on British oil pools had so far only damaged slightly more than two percent of the total oil reserves. News last night said that the London County Council had also recently been bombed by German aircraft. As of 6:00 pm last night, London had only issued one alert yesterday. As for the bombing situation in the West End, a small bomb fell in the front yard of the British Museum. There were three large bomb holes on the street near the Japanese Embassy. The roof of the Beagaterly Hotel on Regent Street was also hit and collapsed. The secretary of the British Museum told the United Press, "We have suffered a slight glorious wound, but the losses are very small. The essence of the museum's antiquities has long been transported to a safe place." (20th United Press dispatch)

Stockholm: According to the latest news from London received here, when the German bombers and fighters attacked London last night, they were flying very low. After breaking through the anti-aircraft fire network on the outskirts of London, the German planes encountered British planes in the northwest district, but the German planes still reached the important targets of bombing in the southwest and northwest districts. The bombing was not over at 3:00 am this morning. The British Ministry of the Interior and the White Hall were partly destroyed, as was the Munson Building in the city center. (20th Haitong dispatch)

### British Naval and Air Forces Attack Italian Military Base in Libya; Considerable Damage to the Italian Fleet in Benghazi; Difficulties with Supplies for Italian Forces Advancing East

Cairo: According to news obtained here today, the British naval and air forces cooperated to attack the Italian military from both sides of the Mediterranean Sea. Italian military raids on the coast of northern Egypt and Italian strongholds in the Dodecanese Islands were all hit. The British Navy apparently suddenly concentrated its forces to make a surprising attack and attacked the Italian military with unprecedented momentum. According to reports, there were many large fires on the Dodecanese Islands, and thick smoke billowed into the sky, which could be seen from ships dozens of miles away. At the same time, the British military headquarters here denied the claim that the Egyptian Italian army had passed Maisa Matru. Today, it was also reported here that the British fleet stationed in Alexandria suddenly sailed towards the Egyptian coast at night, flanking the Italian transportation route from Libya. The British ships came so fast that the Italian military was caught off guard, and their coastal artillery had no chance to fight back. Reconnaissance planes worked hard in the dark to indicate targets, and the British Navy bombarded the Italian supply line from Libya to Egypt with artillery. It was heard that the British army in Egypt was greatly encouraged by the help of the navy. (20th International Agency dispatch)

Cairo: A public notice was released here last night stating that on the 18th of this month, British aircraft attacked the Italian base in the Dodecanese Islands with great success. The Mali area of Rhodes Island was bombed and caught fire, and Calato also had a large fire after several explosions. Porto Lago Bay on Leros Island was attacked, with hangars, barracks, and piers being hit. The oil storage also caught fire. Flames spread along the coast. All British aircraft returned safely. British aircraft continued to attack enemy forces in the western desert. One aircraft was hit and burned in Duna. Tobruk, an important Italian naval base in Libya, was attacked, and buildings were hit. An enemy motorcycle transport team between Sidi Barrani and Solon was bombed and burned. The El Tmimi airfield in Libya was bombed by British aircraft. About fifty enemy aircraft in the field were heavily damaged. Other camps in Pumba, Bardia, and between Gazala and Solon were also bombed. One British aircraft went missing. Also, on the 17th of this month, the South African British Air Force made its sixth raid on the Mogadishu airfield in Italian Somaliland, and all the bombs hit hangars and houses, with fires breaking out in many places. Chawiro in Abyssinia was attacked, and houses and hangars were severely damaged. One enemy bomber was also destroyed. When British bombers attacked Gasara three times, an enemy fighter plane tried to intercept but was destroyed instead. Asmara and Diralenwa in Eritrea were bombed again, with severe fires. (20th Reuters dispatch)

London: A Reuters military visitor stated that the news of the British Air Force's attack on the Italian naval base of Benghazi in Libya shows that the Italian military and supplies going to reinforce it may have been severely deterred. Benghazi Port is located 350 miles east of Tripoli and is advantageous for supplying food and water. The Italian side uses it as an outpost base. However, the Italian military transportation line in North Africa is lengthening, and the supply problem is becoming more difficult. Moreover, the left side of the Italian army along the coast has repeatedly been severely bombarded by the British Navy's fierce artillery fire, causing considerable damage. The Italian military relies on assembling large teams for rapid action, but it has not yet reached the British side's first real defense line, and the British military it has encountered is only a highly mobile force using guerrilla tactics in the desert. The Italian base in Benghazi is about 360 miles away from the vanguard of the Italian army. If the British Air Force continues to harass the Italian military's difficult-to-maintain transportation line, and the British Navy also increases its attacks, the mission of the British Army will be greatly reduced. (20th Reuters dispatch)

### British Bomber Squadrons Bomb Ports at Night; Heaviest Bombing on Le Havre

London – An official announcement stated that on Wednesday night, British bomber squadrons attacked the ports of Antwerp, Zeebrugge, Dunkirk, Ostend, Calais, Boulogne, Dieppe, and Le Havre, continuing to strike at enemy invasion plans. Enemy ships and military targets suffered heavy damage, with fires breaking out in multiple locations. Additionally, British bombers attacked enemy supply distribution centers such as Bessèges. Aircraft based on the British coast also attacked a convoy off Bergen, with one bomb hitting an enemy destroyer. Coastal aircraft attacked Cherbourg and ships off the Dutch coast, as well as the Texel airfield. Seven British aircraft are missing (Reuters, 20th).

London – An Air Ministry communiqué detailed the relentless attacks by British aircraft on enemy-held Channel ports, stating that the heaviest bombing on Wednesday night was on Le Havre. Large British heavy bomber squadrons, divided into multiple groups, braved fierce ground defenses to continuously attack the port's docks and ships for approximately five hours. They dropped multiple tons of high-explosive bombs and a large number of incendiary bombs. One bomb hit a dock, causing two terrifying explosions, apparently from a ship near the basin or a large warehouse by the pier. Flames quickly soared. British bombers, flying fifty miles away from the area, could still see the fire blazing when they looked back. A later British aircraft was attacked by heavy anti-aircraft fire from the port, so intense that the British aircrew could not distinguish between the sound of the exploding bombs. The British aircraft attacked at an altitude of less than a thousand feet, passing through a fire net, and was hit by three "pom-pom" shells, damaging gears, rubber tires, and piercing the fuselage. However, the crew was unharmed, and the aircraft safely returned to its base. Other British aircraft arrived in groups, fiercely bombing docks and ships until dawn. Large fires burned fiercely in various parts of the bombed area. The communiqué also described the fierce attacks by British aircraft on French, Dutch, and Belgian ports. During the attack on Ostend, a British aircraft at an altitude of one thousand five hundred feet dropped a massive bomb. The force of the explosion was so intense that the British aircraft was shaken and turned upside down (Reuters, 20th).

### Spanish Interior Minister Inspects War Zone

Berlin – Spanish Interior Minister Suñer, accompanied by a portion of his entourage, traveled to Brussels last night at 7:45 PM on a special train. From there, they will tour the battlefield by car.

General Salgado will inspect the Berlin police system. The head of the Barcelona district, Català, discussed organizational issues with Dr. Ley, leader of the German Labour Front, yesterday afternoon, and will continue discussions today. Suñer will return to Berlin from Brussels tomorrow morning to continue negotiations from previous days (Haitong Telegraph, 20th).

### Germany and Italy Agree on Plans for a New European Order; Italian Prime Minister and German Foreign Minister Meet Twice

Rome – Reliable sources here state that the Axis powers of Germany and Italy are preparing plans for a new European order, to be implemented based on the situation after Italy occupies Egypt and Germany occupies England. These plans began to be drafted yesterday during a meeting between Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop. The issues included in this new European order, such as Albania's demands on Greece and Yugoslavia, Spain's demands on Gibraltar, etc., are very far-reaching. Therefore, Mussolini and Hitler will need to confer again in the near future. Ribbentrop met with the Italian dictator for two hours yesterday. It is said that their conversation was quite "sincere," and Italian officials expressed satisfaction with the meeting last night, believing that future talks between Hitler and Mussolini will be smooth. However, Italian officials only described the meeting between Ribbentrop and Ciano as "very important" and refused to reveal any details. Officials also deny reports that the Axis powers have made new proposals to Britain. Regarding this point, a responsible Italian government spokesman told a United Press reporter, "We will fight to the last drop of blood if necessary. There are no peace proposals now, only the surrender of the enemy." Authoritative sources also state that Mussolini and Ribbentrop discussed redrawing countless new boundaries on the map of Europe during their meeting. Mussolini's mouthpiece, Gayda, recently wrote in the newspapers that the meeting also discussed the issues of Greece, Yugoslavia, and Turkey. Most Italian newspapers indicate that Albania's demands on Greece have not been abandoned, and Germany and Italy are very dissatisfied with Greece's pro-British stance. At the same time, well-informed sources believe that the Spanish issue also occupied an important position in yesterday's meeting between Mussolini and the German Foreign Minister. Observers point out that the Spanish Ambassador to Italy went to the station to welcome the German Foreign Minister upon his arrival in Italy yesterday, an action unprecedented by previous Spanish envoys. This situation is another sign of Spain's approach to the Axis powers. The Jianghuai Daily recently stated that the meeting between the Italian Prime Minister and the German Foreign Minister was held while Spain expressed its continued solidarity with the Axis powers (Haitong Telegraph, 20th).

Rome – It was announced here today that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini will meet again with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop at 5 PM today (Haitong News Agency, 20th).

Rome – An international intelligence conference here today read out a statement explaining the views of Roman political circles on the meeting between the German Foreign Minister and the Italian leader, stating that the Rome meeting was an important event for close cooperation between the Axis powers, expressing the friendship and sincerity between the two leaders and foreign ministers. Yesterday's declaration did not mention any of the issues discussed in the meeting. This is the policy of the Axis powers, and it is not appropriate to announce during wartime. What can be announced is that the opinions of all parties on the various issues in this meeting, such as future strategies, are completely consistent. The content discussed regarding the Danube and Spanish issues cannot be announced (Haitong News Agency, 20th).

### Situation of Italian Troops Fighting in North Africa; Italian Army Commander-in-Chief Reports to the Italian Prime Minister

Rome – Yesterday, newspapers here published a letter from General Graziani to Mussolini, describing the fighting situation of the Italian army on the Egyptian-Libyan border. It stated that the original strategy of the Italian army was to attack the British right wing, but due to enemy reinforcements, a lightning attack was launched on the left wing. As a result, the British armored vehicle column's rear was cut off. The Italian army's line of defense is as follows: the first line consists of several Libyan divisions, with the 20th Army Corps and artillery in the rear. The left wing consists of two mechanized army corps, and the right wing consists of a Blackshirt division as a reserve force. The combat plan is divided into two aspects: one is to advance to the point where the attack began, and the other is to attack the gates of Sollum and Halfaya, and then advance rapidly to Bardia. Difficulties were encountered in the second phase in Malerki, so the army quickly advanced north with the 10th Army Corps. On September 13th, the Italian army unexpectedly attacked Sollum and Halfaya, and by the evening of the 14th, they arrived at Teitan and Qaha, 25 kilometers from Sollum. On the 16th, Bardia was occupied, and a large number of British war materials were captured. According to various evidence, the British army's internal arrangements were improper, lacking drinking water and gasoline, and the headquarters were chaotic and at a loss. General Graziani highly praised the Italian army's bravery and endurance, as well as the Italian Air Force's attacks on the enemy and its protective work. British military experts predicted that the maximum number of Italian troops advancing along the coast would be 15,000, along with a small number of vehicles. In fact, the Italian mechanized units that passed through the area numbered 2,000 vehicles (Haitong Telegraph, 20th).

### Soviet Union Intensifies Fortifications on Romanian Border

Bucharest, Romania – News has recently been received from various locations along the border between this country and the Soviet Union, particularly from Galați and Iași, that the Soviet authorities are building fortifications and constructing multiple airfields in the border area (Havas News Agency, 19th).

Bucharest – Romanian authorities issued an official gazette last night accusing the Hungarian troops occupying Outer Transylvania of arbitrary killings and arson. The official gazette cited 13 specific cases, detailing the events, proving that ten Romanians were killed by Hungarian troops, and several buildings in Outer Transylvanian villages were set on fire by Hungarian troops. One teacher and one pastor were burned to death (Haitong News Agency, 20th).

### New Caledonia Island Severs Ties with Vichy Government; Support for Free France Grows

Melbourne – The Australian Federal Government has received notification that the French New Caledonia Island in Oceania has severed ties with the Vichy government and announced its allegiance to General de Gaulle, leader of the Free French forces in England. De Gaulle has appointed Sautot as Governor of New Caledonia Island, replacing General Denis, appointed by the Vichy government, who has now resigned. Australian Prime Minister Menzies stated that New Caledonia Island's allegiance to General de Gaulle further strengthens the connection between the island and Australia. The welfare of New Caledonia Island is related to Australia's genuine material interests, but this relationship is not an expression of hostility towards anyone else. This new development will not hinder the commercial agreements between Australia and the mining industry of New Caledonia Island (Reuters, 20th).

Hong Kong – The "Cross of Lorraine" badge worn by Free French supporters of General de Gaulle is now also seen in Hong Kong. A French architect has set up an office, and several French citizens have already registered there, volunteering to join the Free French Army currently being formed in England, and will depart as soon as possible. Those in charge may establish a committee to raise funds to cover their expenses to England (Reuters, 20th).

### Romanian Prime Minister Changes Title to Leader

Bucharest – Romanian Prime Minister Antonescu will henceforth be called "Leader." The Foreign Ministry has notified foreign diplomats stationed in Romania that they should also use this title in diplomatic correspondence. This matter was passed by the Legionary Movement, which has now recognized Antonescu as a member of the Legionary Movement (Haitong News Agency, 20th).

### Random Notes on the European War (Part 1): Compiègne – Tragedy in the Forest

This old-fashioned 2419D dining car was originally designed and built by Fleming, an American from California, and was stored in a museum seventy-five yards away. A week before the signing, German engineers, following Hitler's orders, moved it to the designated historically significant location. Journalists at the scene saw Hitler through the dust-covered windows, sitting in the chair once occupied by Foch, in front of his statue. To his left and right were Göring and Keitel; Brauchitsch and Hess sat on one side; Raeder and Ribbentrop sat on the other. Four empty seats were left at the opposite end.

At 3:30 PM, the four French representatives arrived by car and disembarked in front of the Alsace-Lorraine Memorial. They were General Huntziger, wearing a khaki uniform; Air Force General Bergeret; Navy Vice-Admiral Le Luc, all in dark blue uniforms; and former Polish Ambassador Noël, wearing civilian army attire. The representatives glanced at the war victory memorial covered by the swastika flag as they walked forward, accompanied by three German officers. The German guards saluted the French representatives.

After the French representatives boarded the car, the German leaders stood up in solemn respect. Hitler greeted the French representatives with a Nazi salute. Göring and Raeder saluted with their batons. Brauchitsch and Keitel saluted militarily, while Hess and Ribbentrop raised their arms in the Nazi salute. The French representatives returned the military salute. Hitler then sat down, nodding to General Keitel, who, in a calm tone, read aloud the preamble to the armistice terms proposed by Hitler in German, roughly stating: "On November 11, 1918, in this train car, the era of suffering for the German people began... On September 3, 1939,... England and France, without any reason, declared war on Germany again. Now, due to the judgment of firepower, Germany has been invited to propose ceasefire terms. If the historically significant Compiègne Forest is chosen as the site for receiving and delivering these terms, this is also a once and for all, appropriate matter. From this act of bovine retribution, it is good to wipe out a kind of memory that is not honorable in France and deeply ashamed of by the German side. After several bloody battles and heroic resistance, France has disintegrated. Germany does not want to impose conditions of an abusive nature on a brave enemy."

At 3:42 PM, Hitler stood up as a courtesy and then got out of the car. Except for General Keitel, the German leaders followed him and left. They walked past the guards as the music played loudly. Shortly after, they boarded the car and drove back to glorious Germany under the leafy branches of the Compiègne Forest. Here, in the 2419D dining car, Keitel stood in front of the green baize table, reading out the terms of the armistice one by one to the four French representatives. The negotiations were generally conducted in German. The French representatives were very proficient in German; the chief representative, General Huntziger, was originally from Alsace.

At 4:26 PM, the sun shone on the back of the forest, and some shadows were already dark in the open space. The French representatives then walked down the dining car and retreated into a small tent at the edge of the field. Inside were four wooden chairs, a table, and a washbasin. A bunch of roses was also placed on the table. Each seat had a document folder, and a calendar was marking this memorable date of June 21st. Telephone and telegraph lines could directly connect to Bordeaux, where General Pétain and his cabinet were eagerly waiting to hear this news. The draft of the conditions given to the French side by General Keitel consisted of thirty pages of paper, entirely in French. While the French representatives retreated into the tent to discuss, he took the time to get out of the car and stroll in the forest.

That evening, the French representatives drove fifty-two miles southwest of Paris, through the deserted streets under a curfew that began at nine o'clock, and stayed overnight in a hotel. The next morning, they returned to the small tent in the forest clearing. General Keitel allowed them to use the dining car, adding five secretaries inside. The French representatives carefully studied each clause. Almost every clause had to be discussed in detail with Bordeaux; every clause had to obtain the consent of General Keitel, who was outwardly polite but very firm in attitude. The next afternoon, Keitel sent someone to tell the French representatives that time was running short. The French chief representative, General Huntziger, replied that the French side was ready. Then, the French and German sides negotiated everything again at the green baize table.

General Huntziger said to the German representatives: "The French delegation believes that there is one more thing that needs to be stated. After being defeated in battle, France gave up armed resistance, hoping to use the spirit of this consultation to allow the two countries to obtain opportunities for common survival and mutual cooperation in the future. As a soldier, you should know how painful this time is for me." General Keitel replied: "I accept your words... I can only answer that the glory given by the victor to the vanquished is worthy of respect."

After the representatives of both sides spoke a few words, French Navy Vice-Admiral Le Luc wiped the tears from his cheeks. Amidst the rustling of pen tips, a French sentence was heard: "General, please give me the pen." The sound of the second signature began again. At this time, it was exactly 6:50 PM German summer time.

The four French representatives, having signed in the Compiègne Forest, were mentally exhausted and drove to Munich, where Hitler and Mussolini had already finalized their joint armistice treaty. After a good night's sleep, German military planes transported the French delegation to Rome to hear the Italian terms. In the 17th-century Villa Incisa, twelve miles from the outskirts of Rome, the French delegation met with Italian Foreign Minister Ciano, Chief of Staff General Badoglio, Admiral Cavagnari, and General Pricolo. Although France had no way not to accept the terms proposed by the Italian side, the French delegation spent twenty-four hours consulting with Bordeaux. Until 7:15 PM Italian summer time, two days after the signing of the Franco-German armistice, French General Huntziger and Italian General Badoglio signed the second armistice treaty.

At 1:35 AM German-Italian summer time on June 25, 1940, the war in France completely ended. Hitler announced to the people: "Thanks to God's blessing, flags should be hung in Germany for ten days and bells should be rung for seven days." France stipulated this day as a day of national humiliation. The Bordeaux newspapers said that France was not only defeated in battle, but all organizations and systems were also greatly damaged. The mistakes and sins of the past one or two decades have come to an end.

### Finance: Tension in Vietnam Stimulates Chinese Merchants to Buy US Dollars

The foreign exchange market situation yesterday: HSBC announced its exchange rates, with the British pound reduced by 0.125 to 3 3/8, and the US dollar reduced by 0.0625 to $5.0625. Other exchange rates also followed suit, tightening slightly. The unofficial markets for British and US dollars suddenly turned tight and stable, due to continued demand for settling rice bills from abroad, and the afternoon rumors of various positive developments in Vietnam, stimulating speculators to aggressively purchase US dollars amounting to over 300,000, but fortunately foreign banks were willing to supply US dollars at $5.25 as much as possible, resulting in the British pound only tightening by 0.015625, and the US dollar only tightening by 0.03125, with the September futures almost aligned with the spot price, differing only in whether they were easy or difficult to settle.

HSBC Exchange Rates Reduced

Early morning, the London price fell close to 0.125, New York silver prices remained flat, London gold remained unchanged, and the exchange rates of the British pound against the US dollar and the Shanghai dollar were flat, and the US dollar against the British pound and the Shanghai dollar also remained unchanged. Central bank exchange rates remained as before. The opening selling prices of banks for spot currencies were 3 1/2 for the British pound and $5.28125 for the US dollar, with no change compared to the previous closing prices. After opening, the market suddenly tightened slightly due to considerable demand from the foreign firms. Rice merchants and foreign firms bought US dollars for spot at $5.28125 and $5.25 from foreign banks. HSBC announced its exchange rates, reducing the British pound by 0.125 and the US dollar by a small amount of 0.0625. The silver balancing tax was announced unchanged. Thereafter, relying on the supply from Hong Kong telegrams and foreign banks were also willing to release dollars at that time, but the demand for British pounds was higher, still slightly soft, while the US dollar relied on it to return to flat. Hong Kong telegrams sold spot British gold at 3 3/8 and Chinese merchants released spot US dollars at $5.3125 to foreign banks. After 11 o'clock, Chinese and foreign firms released currencies, and the Hong Kong dollar also returned to strength, with the US dollar slightly hardening. Chinese firms released US dollars for September at $5.28125 and $5.3125 to foreign banks, and HSBC sold spot British gold at 3 1/2 to foreign firms and peer banks. By the closing of the morning session, the British pound stood at 3 1/2 and the US dollar at $5.28125.

Tea Merchants Release Dollars, Turning Stable

The afternoon market was initially quiet, but around 3 o'clock, due to rumors of various positive developments in Vietnam, Chinese merchants suddenly developed buying interest, aggressively purchasing over 300,000 dollars in September and October futures, and the market softened suddenly. Transactions included Chinese banks, Shanghai East Asia Bank, and foreign banks such as Oliver & Co. and the Belgian Bank buying September futures at $5.25 and October futures at $5.25 and $5.21875. Fortunately, foreign banks were still willing to supply and export tea merchants slightly released currencies, stopping the tightening trend and making it flat.

### Sudden Good News Revives the Gold Market After a Fall

Yesterday, the cash "boiled red" (烚赤 - slang for spot market) black market situation initially showed a weak trend. Unexpectedly, before the evening close, it suddenly rebounded strongly. First, cash brokers and securities firms frequently exerted pressure, and around noon, this triggered a tendency among general floating traders to sell. The lowest price of the day reached 6,195 yuan. The afternoon opening was quiet, but around 3 p.m., news suddenly spread that the Japanese side had presented an ultimatum to Vietnam, demanding a reply within 72 hours, along with various mixed and favorable news. The foreign exchange market showed a slight tightening again, leading to considerable buying activity, pushing the price to a high of 6,290 yuan at one point. However, the result was that many profits were taken, causing the evening close to fall back to 6,265 yuan, an increase of 47 yuan compared to the previous day's settlement. The total trading volume was approximately 4,000 taels. Gold jewelry prices in silver shops remained unchanged. Customs gold and other types of gold remained stable.

Boiled Red Rises by 47 Yuan

The morning market was calm at the start. Silver brokers initially offered 10 taels of gold at 6,215 yuan, a slight decrease of 3 yuan compared to the previous closing price. Subsequently, due to still many sellers, the price continued to drop by 5 yuan, falling to 6,210 yuan. Then, a slight tightening of the foreign exchange market stimulated buying activity, with money exchange businesses and silver brokers competing to buy, gradually pushing the price up to 6,240 yuan. However, after that, the tightening of the foreign exchange market stopped and tended to stabilize. Gold brokers frequently sold, and soon securities firms followed suit, selling short. The market trend frequently turned downwards, and by 11:30 a.m., it had plummeted to the 6,200 yuan level, reaching a low price of 6,195 yuan. Later, the number of sellers decreased, and with the support of money exchange businesses, it recovered to 6,210 yuan. Finally, due to the excessive interest rates charged on margin accounts, there was renewed selling, so the noon close was only 6,200 yuan. At the afternoon opening, gold brokers initially offered 10 taels of gold at 6,210 yuan. Later, it briefly fell by 5 yuan, but soon a certain gold broker suddenly started buying aggressively. At that time, silver brokers intervened to sell, so the upward trend was slow. Before long, it rose to 6,220 yuan, and then slightly reached 6,215 yuan. Unexpectedly, after that, the buying activity suddenly expanded due to reports of various favorable news from Vietnam and a tightening foreign exchange market, which excited the people. Gold brokers and money exchange businesses bought aggressively, and silver brokers also turned around and started buying, at one point reaching as high as 6,290 yuan. After 3:15 p.m., the buying activity gradually dissipated, and the foreign exchange market had slightly stabilized, immediately triggering profit-taking. A certain gold broker also closed out positions from it, so before the close, it fell back to 6,258 yuan. However, as the people's confidence remained strong, the evening close was still 6,265 yuan, an increase of 47 yuan compared to the settlement of the previous day, with a fluctuation range of 95 yuan throughout the day. The selling price of the original funds of cash brokers was about ten yuan higher than "boiled red", and the buying price was 30 yuan lower. The current marked gold price is over 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price, and there is little activity in both.

Gold Jewelry Prices Still Unchanged

The selling price of gold jewelry in silver shops remained unchanged throughout the day. Da Tong Heng still hung a price of 640 yuan per tael. The price in Xin Tong Heng was the same as the above, with the buying price reduced by about 30 yuan.

### Foreign Currency Strengthens in the Evening

Yesterday's foreign currency market, the "boiled red" market price, initially fluctuated slightly lower. In the afternoon, there were sudden rumors of favorable news, causing the market price to rise frequently. English and American gold pounds also fell first and then rebounded, ultimately rising by one yuan each. There was still no shortage of demand for English gold notes, and the market price continued to rise by half a jiao (角 - a unit of currency). The price of American gold notes initially fell to 18 yuan, 7 jiao, and 3 fen (分 - a smaller unit of currency). In the afternoon, rumors of favorable news stirred up, and the evening market rose to 18 yuan and 8 jiao and a half, an increase of 7 fen compared to the previous day's close. The price of Hong Kong notes followed the Hong Kong-Shanghai exchange rate and rose another 3 fen. The price of Singapore notes rose by one jiao. The prices of Japanese gold notes and Korean notes continued to rise steadily, with the former reaching as high as 1 yuan, 5 jiao, and 1 fen, and the latter reaching as high as 1 yuan, 1 jiao, and 8 fen.

### Hankou Shanghai Exchange Rate Continues to Fall

According to Hankou news, due to supply and demand relationships, the Shanghai exchange rate has continued to fall, with each thousand yuan increasing the premium by two yuan, i.e., Hankou paying 998 yuan in legal tender for 1,000 yuan in Shanghai legal tender. Each yuan of Japanese currency is worth 1 yuan, 3 jiao, and 4 fen in legal tender. The buying price of gold is 605 yuan per tael, and the selling price is 645 yuan. Previously, the exchange rate from Hankou to Shanghai was 50 yuan per thousand yuan.

### Grains: New Rice Gains Popularity, Another 30,000 Bags of Foreign Rice Arrive

The black market price of foreign rice has recently become sluggish because 2,000-3,000 bags of national rice are successively transported from the suburbs of Shanghai to the city daily, which are directly received and sold by rice stores. Only so-called "bouncing ball" businesses make occasional forays, creating invisible rises and falls. These "bouncing ball" businesses have seemed calmer recently, but because of the price of production, sellers remain firm, and the market has risen by five or six jiao. After the rise, many floating traders flock out to sell, actual sales stop completely, and cargo owners do not take manipulative advantage, so the market falls in line with sentiment by small steps of six or seven jiao by noon. The result is that most deals are similar to before, and a minority are only one or two jiao less. Saigon first-grade and coarse-milled both sell for 17 yuan. Siamese first-grade sells for 66 yuan, second-grade for 61.5 yuan, coarse-milled for 61.8 yuan, Saigon second-grade for 62.5 yuan, broken rice for 53 yuan, and ground rice for 56.7 yuan. Jardine Matheson and Cie. and China Merchants Steam Navigation Co. Saigon Siamese are both marked at around 73 yuan, and there have been transactions. Only 3,000 bags of national rice have been traded.

Foreign rice has continued to arrive in recent days. It was reported in previous newspapers that the Jardine Matheson and Cie.'s Ding Sheng and China Merchants Steam Navigation Co.'s Taiyuan had transported foreign rice from Hong Kong. Yesterday afternoon, China Merchants Steam Navigation Co.'s Shandong arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong, also transporting 4,288 bags of foreign rice, berthing at the China Merchants Steam Navigation Co. wharf in the French Concession to unload. China Travel Service Shipping Company's Haida, which had directly loaded over 26,000 bags of foreign rice from the West, was hindered from entering the harbor when it reached the Wusongkou on Sunday (the 15th), and it was not allowed to enter the port for five days. It only entered the port yesterday morning, and is now unloading along the Pudong Hong Yu wharf.

No glutinous rice has arrived, so the market relies on existing stocks. But sales continue to be non-existent, and the market has fallen by four or five jiao. Opening Jinli special-grade sells for 68-69.5 yuan, Changdan white-grade sells for 67.5-68 yuan, Hong Kong special-grade sells for 68.5-69 yuan, and ordinary sells for 65-66 yuan.

The black market prices for national rice like thick/thin and broken early japonica are weak and stable. The opened prices are: Changbang special japonica 79 yuan, ordinary 75-76 yuan, Wuchang Su Kun japonica high 77.5 yuan, and second-grade 73-74 yuan. Qingpu thin broken ordinary sells for 75-76 yuan, and Nan Gang early broken sells for around 71 yuan per dan (斛 - a unit of dry measure).

New japonica varieties from various sources arriving in Shanghai yesterday by land and water were approximately 2,500-2,600 shi (石 - a unit of dry measure). Sales were mediocre, and the market fell by four or five jiao. The opened prices are: new japonica 71 yuan, Taicang Jiading Yanjian sold for 60 yuan per dan, and Dujian sold for 60.5 yuan per dan.

### Phoenix Flour Settles at 15.7 Yuan, Wheat Supply is Slightly Improved

Flour: Spot flour continued to be in demand yesterday, because the supply from the Fufeng and Fuchang factories was limited, which was insufficient to meet demand in the trade. Each bag sold for 16.8 yuan, and there was no surplus to supply. It is said that the trade purchased over 2,000 bags of Red Plum brand no. 4 flour from the Fufeng factory at a price of 15.23 yuan to meet the needs of retail sales. Other flour such as inland and foreign flour all shouted higher prices but were rarely actually transacted. It has been decided that the futures contracts from the Japanese-owned Phoenix brand will be settled regardless of the transaction price. It is said that this matter was settled between buyers and sellers at 15.7 yuan, and is now being negotiated. Market trading continues to be at a standstill.

Wheat: Yesterday the supply of wheat was slightly improved because a small amount was transported from places such as Taicang, Danyang, and Chuzhou. The Japanese mill's foreign exchange rate was only around 21 yuan, and the cargo owners were unwilling to sell, so only 1,000-2,000 bags were sent to the mill for unloading. The Chinese mills received over 2,000 bags of Danyang and Taicang wheat at a price of 24.6-24.65 yuan. It is also said that the inland trade also bought 100 bags of Chuzhou new wheat at a price of 24.65 yuan, and the market is firm.

### Securities: Small Trading in Domestic Debt

The black market for securities yesterday fluctuated slightly. After falling sharply by six or seven jiao, it recovered slightly. The market seemed to be slightly firmer because trading was small from the opening of the market in the morning until close to the afternoon closing. Speculators in the market frequently changed from bullish to bearish at any moment. Yesterday, at the morning open, the No. 7, No. 41, and Tongkang stocks were bought slightly, while Yongfeng and Hengfu were sold, and the market price fell slightly by three or five jiao. In the afternoon, it continued to be weak. Class C stocks broke through the four yuan level, and Yongkang, Tongkang, Datong, etc. had considerable demand. The market then followed the trend, changing from bearish to bullish, and Class C stocks rose again by several jiao. However, sellers such as Shunchang, Lianhe, Hengfu, Yongfeng, etc. continued to sell, so the market price was still about two or three jiao lower than the previous day. The trading volume was about 800,000-900,000 yuan. A brief summary table is listed below.

In stock trading, 600 shares of China Electric Company were traded at a price of 6 yuan. The late-night market opening at the Public Chamber of Commerce continued the firm trend of the previous day, and all stocks generally rose again. Wheelock Marden was traded heavily at a price of 86.5 yuan. There was a slight disturbance in the morning due to the news from Vietnam, and prices fluctuated greatly, but there was no sign of softening. The trading volume of industrial stocks was very common, while rubber stocks were very sluggish.

London, 19th (Friday) Cable: The listed prices of Chinese foreign debt and Far East British companies' stocks remained calm today, with minimal price fluctuations. Hong Kong & Shanghai Bank shares fell by one shilling and three pence, priced at eleven pounds. Gula-Kalumpang Rubber Estates rose by seven and a half pence, priced at fourteen shillings and four and a half pence. The rest remained unchanged.

### China Thread Company's Capital Increase: Subscription Exceeds Tenfold in One Day; Allocation Proportional to the Number of Shares Subscribed

China Thread Company, managed by Reiss & Co., offered 400,000 new shares on the 19th, with a par value of 5 yuan per share and a price of 5.5 yuan. After the opening of the subscription, by 10:30 a.m. on the same day, the subscription amount had reached 21.5 million yuan, exceeding the original share amount by tenfold. It is said that the company allocates shares proportionally, with those subscribing for 500 shares receiving 20%, those subscribing for over 1,000 shares receiving 10%, and those subscribing for over 10,000 shares receiving 5%.

### Yarn & Cotton: Major Speculators Seize Opportunity to Sell High; Cotton Yarn Goes from High to Low

The yarn market, which had been rising the previous day, re-entered a revolving path yesterday. This was because Hong Kong buyers were significantly less active than the previous day, so although the bulls maintained support, they released a small amount of their positions, which they considered excessive, given the lack of significant improvement in the actual situation. As a result, the market fell from high to low, but the general sentiment still tended to be bullish. In short, the stock reserves are sufficient, but without a steady stream of sales, the market will be difficult to prosper.

Spot Yarn: The market opened with bulls making a play on the firm market situation of the previous day, and the shouting of higher prices was chaotic. However, a large number of major speculators took the opportunity to sell, and the opening price of 20s Double Horse was 1,019 yuan. There were many sellers, and the market immediately relaxed. At the same time, rumors returned to quiet the market, and the market fell from high to happy, dropping to 1,004 yuan. Then, the bulls came back to cover short positions, and a few packages were bought back, returning to 1,007 yuan at the close. It was found that the half-day trading volume was 3,145 packages, and the price of 20s Double Horse rose by 2.5 yuan. The amounts bought by each trade are listed below:

Trade 2,290, Hong Kong 855, Total 3,145

### Cotton Mill's Appetite Slightly Moves

The spot cotton situation has been slightly more active, but large-scale transactions still cannot develop, but it is more active compared to before. The spot cotton transaction prices are listed below:

Wesson 234.00, Toyota Mill bought 200 bales

Great China 225.00, Xinsheng Mill bought 200 bales

Xindonggou 180.00, Guangdong Mill bought 100 bales

Secondary Great China 154.00, Rongfeng Mill bought 112 bales

Pengjiapu 224.50, An Yu bought 200 bales

Also 123.50, Also 100 bales

Fire Machine Cotton 155.00, Sen Tai bought 120 bales

According to further news, the foreign cotton market price: the New York cotton market initially rose due to speculative buying, and then due to good spot transactions, and Wall Street buying, the closing price was eight or nine points higher than the previous day. India fell one rupee yesterday.

Shanghai's foreign cotton transactions have recently been slightly more active because the price of yarn has loosened. The mills are only making small transactions, buying only those with low prices. The Japanese side has rumors of continuing to reduce work, so there is no news of transactions in recent days.

### Silk & Tea: Japanese Silk Comes to Shanghai for Promotion, Affected by American Thrifting

According to a certain foreign firm, Japanese silk will be coming to Shanghai soon, and it is said that two boxes of sample silk have already arrived. The silk uses two strands of silk to form a thread, which is most suitable for silk factories. It is also said that this year's Japanese silk production is approximately 710,000 packages, a decrease of 17% compared to last year. However, European sales are currently cut off, and American sales are also affected by "Nylon," a new artificial silk that is quite popular in the United States (47 out of 494 hosiery factories in the United States have completely adopted nylon for hosiery), so in recent times, actual sales of Japanese silk in the United States have often been around 15,000 packages, i.e. a total of 180,000 packages per year. Japanese silk will inevitably have a surplus of 530,000 packages to find a way out, so it is quite possible, based on the circumstances, that Japanese silk will come to Shanghai recently. However, the cost of Japanese silk is more expensive than Chinese silk, and Chinese silk factories may not be able to use it.

### Piece Goods: Trade in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Cloth is Exclusively Dominated by Japanese Merchants

The cloth market trend is flat, and actual sales are sluggish. This is because the transport of goods from Guangdong, Fujian, and eastern Zhejiang is intermittent, and the handling of goods is not smooth. There is a rumor that the trade in cloth in the guerrilla areas of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui is entirely dominated by Japanese trading houses, and the market atmosphere is increasingly dim. Stockholders also lack interest. Yesterday, cloth prices had little fluctuation. Hand goods are cheaper than factory goods by 2.5 jiao. The trade transacted over 300 pieces of gray cloth, colored cloth, and velvet. The Zhejiang-Fujian traders transacted over 200 pieces of colored cloth and coarse cloth. The Guangdong-Hong Kong traders transacted over 200 pieces. The northern Yantai traders transacted nearly 100 pieces of heavy coarse cloth. 2,030 pieces were shipped to Yantai on the 21st.

There were few transactions by buyers on the east side, but the sentiment in the market was more lively, and the selling price was slightly higher. The closing price for 12-pound Longtou fine cloth futures was 32.75 yuan, and Four Gentlemen drill was sold at 9 jiao, 2 fen, and 2.5 li (厘 - a very small unit of currency) per yard.

### Dried and Preserved Goods: New Goods of Powdered Vermicelli and Black Dates Enter the Market

The prices of Tianjin red dates have been rising recently because of the need to settle in foreign exchange (US dollars). The inventory of over 200 packages that were opened earlier has risen by ten to several yuan each. Jujube King is 85 yuan, then asked for 90 yuan, Jujube Head is 80 yuan, Show Household is 74 yuan, and Secondary Household is 64 yuan. Dozens of packages of new black dates have arrived, and the goods are average. Hand goods are opening at 50 yuan.

New Jiangbei powdered vermicelli has recently arrived at 24 yuan. Because the inventory bottom is empty, the market is quite good, opening as high as 85 yuan, also a new high price.

### Oil Cakes: Raw Oil Falls Sharply

In yesterday's oil market, the soybean oil market was mild. Both sides were paying attention to raw oil, the scope of buying and selling was limited, and prices remained the same. 20 barrels of Dalian oil, 100 dan (擔 - a unit of weight) of refined oil, and 350 dan of Dayou Yu factory oil were transacted. Peanut oil was highly speculative, so its waves of rise and fall were unpredictable. Continuing the weary winds of the previous day, it immediately fell at the open. Afterward, there were widespread rumors that Qingdao reported continued increases, but the Japanese are buying them to ship to Shanghai, causing panic. Selling was widespread, and prices frequently fell. As a result, it rose slightly at the close, but it was still down two yuan from the previous day. The spot price was inevitably affected, and also fell two yuan. 70 pieces of Chefoo raw oil were transacted at a price of 66 yuan, and 150 pieces of Jiaozhou raw oil were transacted at 66.5-66 yuan. 250 pieces were booked for delivery in late September at the same price as the spot oil, 500 pieces were booked for delivery in early October at a price of 66.5-67.5 yuan, and over 2,000 pieces were booked for delivery in late October at a price that fell from 69 yuan to 67.5 yuan. The closing price was 68 yuan. 100 barrels of Qingdao raw oil were transacted at a price of 93 yuan, and 50 barrels were booked for delivery in early October, also at 93 yuan, and 100 barrels were booked for delivery in early November at 93.5 yuan.

### Sugar Market Sugar Prices Continue Tight

Yesterday, the sugar market trend remained tight. The guild sold off. Spot prices for "Erligao" coarse white sugar from local warehouses were 78.50 yuan, up 50 cents yesterday. Imported sugar was also 78.50 yuan. Re-export sugar initially sold for 63 yuan, later rising to 63.50 yuan, up 70 cents. Dutch refined white sugar (BS mark) was 73.50 yuan. Dutch raw sugar ("" mark) was 63 yuan, up 50 cents. Road sugar was 62 yuan. Taikoo refined white sugar (B mark) was 76.50 yuan, up 50 cents. CW mark was 75.50 yuan. DY mark was 73.40 yuan, up 10 cents. KX mark initially sold for 73 yuan, quickly rising to 73.40 yuan, up 40 cents. H mark raw sugar was 62.50 yuan. First-grade ice sugar was 96 yuan. Crystal-clear ice sugar was 97.50 yuan, with little fluctuation. Hao Fang offered 50 bags of Surabaya Green (Java Green produced in Holland), priced at 74 yuan. The asking price for domestic "Diao Qing" sugar was tight, but buyers were still 1-2 yuan short of the asking price, so no deal was made. 268 bags of sugar arrived from Hong Kong.

### Public Concession Tram Workers Suddenly Launch a Strike Wave All Lines Halted Yesterday Morning Authorities Highly Concerned, Mediating

Five hundred workers, including coppersmiths from the Beikaier Road depot of the British-owned tram company, requested improved conditions on the 10th of this month due to difficult living conditions. After taking slow-down action on the morning before yesterday (the 19th), yesterday morning at 5:00 AM, two thousand ticket conductors from the company also suddenly joined the work slowdown, causing the situation to escalate. The company's operations could not continue. Yesterday, all tram and trolleybus lines in the Public Concession were completely halted, causing serious disruptions to the city's transportation. The reason for the ticket conductors' work slowdown was also due to unsuccessful demands for improved treatment. However, according to sources from the management side, the striking workers never consulted with the company beforehand and only presented their demands after the work slowdown began. The Concession authorities are paying close attention to this labor dispute due to its significant impact. Yesterday, representatives from the Industrial Section and the Political Division of the Shanghai Municipal Council were dispatched to investigate and worked diligently in the afternoon to facilitate a peaceful resolution of the dispute.

Workers Put Forward Four Demands

Workers from the company's coppersmith, ticket conductor, and driver departments have presented four demands for improved treatment to the management: (1) Cancellation of the company's original rice subsidy, with each person receiving five "dou" of rice per month; (2) Each worker to receive a daily miscellaneous expense allowance of one yuan; (3) An increase of five cents in wages per hour of work for workers; (4) Short-term workers with more than six months of service to be considered long-term workers. The above conditions were originally presented to the acting manager of the company by the coppersmiths' representatives at 2:00 PM on the 19th. Because they were rejected, they first took slow-down action, and only yesterday did they take unified action with the ticket conductors.

All Lines Completely Halted

Due to the general strike by the ticket conductors, the company's vehicles did not leave the depot and all lines were completely halted. These include: (A) Trams: Line 1 (The Bund to Jing'an Temple), Line 2 (Yangjingbang to Jing'an Temple), Line 3 (Dongxin Bridge to Maigen Road), Line 5 (Xiaobeimen to North Station), Line 6 (Yuan Road); (B) Trolleybuses: Line 14 (Zhengjia Muqiao to North Station), Line 16 (Sanyangjing Bridge to Caojiadu), Line 17 (Dapu Bridge to Sichuan Road Bridge), Line 18 (Xieqiao to North Station), Line 19 (Sanyangjing Bridge to Yichang Road), Line 20 (Zhaofeng Park to New Customs Wharf), Line 21 (Sichuan Road Bridge to Yichang Road), Line 24 (Xiaoshadu Road to West Gate). Due to the strike of the British tram company, the French tram Line 5 and trolleybus Lines 17 and 18 also suspended service to the Public Concession.

Public Buses Overcrowded

Since the complete halt of trams, transportation in the Public Concession now relies solely on the British public buses. Yesterday, there were reports that some workers from the company's coppersmith department had also taken slow-down action, but this was denied by company officials. Yesterday, all British public bus lines continued to operate as usual, and business was exceptionally busy due to the tram stoppage. To prevent the public buses from becoming too crowded, the company specially allocated a dozen or so additional buses to join the various lines to meet passenger demand.

Authorities Highly Concerned, Mediating with All Efforts

The Political Division and the Industrial Section of the Public Concession Shanghai Municipal Council consider trams to be a public transportation utility. If the labor dispute is allowed to drag on, it would have a significant impact on the order of the Concession. Therefore, detectives Gao Yangen and Gu Bingyuan were specially dispatched to the company and the labor side to mediate. However, since the intentions of the two sides were still difficult to reconcile, no resolution was reached. It was decided to continue persuasion. The police authorities, fearing that the striking workers might cause other disputes, specially dispatched a large number of detectives to be stationed at the head office on Suzhou Road, the factory on Huasheng Road, the Jing'an Temple depot, the Hed Road depot, and the Beikaier Road material depot to provide protection.

Operations in the French Concession Continued as Usual

Due to the impact of the British tram stoppage, all tram lines in the French Concession stopped entering the Public Concession yesterday. Trolleybus Line 17 only ran from Dapu Bridge to the Great World. Line 18 only ran from Xieqiao to the Great World. Line 24 ran from West Gate via Route Lafayette to Route Albert (Avenue Foch). Routes 3 and 5, which run from West Gate to the North Railway Station, were also suspended in the French Concession because their main business was in the Public Concession. Yesterday, French tram and bus lines were also quite crowded, and the companies allocated additional vehicles to join the service.

Strike Developments as Reported in Western Newspapers

The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reported that approximately eight hundred Shanghai Tramway Company employees, including drivers, ticket sellers, and coolies, were incited by striking coppersmiths from the company's Beikaier Road depot machine shop and began striking at 4:30 AM yesterday, resulting in the complete disappearance of trams from the streets yesterday. Subsequently, at around 5:30 AM, workers from the Connaught Road branch of the China General Omnibus Company also took action in response and began a

Sit-Down Strike

Inciting other employees and workers to join. Yesterday morning, an official from the tram company stated that the striking workers had not yet presented any demands, and the bus workers had adopted the same attitude. Yesterday morning, the police authorities increased the number of police officers stationed at the offices of the two companies

To Prevent Any Accidents

A reporter from the "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" inquired about the strike situation with Arno Jones, secretary of the bus company, who replied that there were no disputes and everything was as usual. Yesterday morning, the Concession police authorities reported the same situation regarding the labor dispute, but the buses were still

Operating as Usual

Until 12:30 PM yesterday, the bus authorities expressed to the workers their willingness to consider their demand for an increase in cost-of-living allowances, so the labor dispute was temporarily resolved. Traffic Manager Zheng Dela of the company mediated the labor dispute and promised the workers that if the authorities accepted the workers' demands, a separate announcement would be made on Monday.

### Xie Jinyuan Cables British and American Authorities, Appealing for Justice; Shanghai Municipal Council Remains Silent; Situation Generally Stable Yesterday

Since the unfortunate incident at the Lone Army Barracks, several days have passed. Local Chinese residents deeply regret the inappropriate measures taken by the Shanghai Municipal Council. Yesterday, the Shanghai Municipal Council remained silent, responding to inquiries from Chinese and foreign journalists with, "No information to release." A reporter from the Pingming News Agency inquired with senior officials of the Shanghai Municipal Council but received only the response, "The Shanghai Municipal Council is continuing its investigation." However, it is understood that the Lone Army Barracks is still surrounded by White Russian detachments of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps.

### Xie Jinyuan Cables British and American Authorities

Yesterday, Regiment Commander Xie Jinyuan sent a cable to the British and American authorities, the text of which is as follows: "To the English-language *Shanghai Evening Post*, please forward to President Roosevelt of the United States and Prime Minister Churchill of London, and appeal to people worldwide. We are the eight hundred Lone Soldiers who, in October 1937, were ordered to cover the retreat when our troops in Shanghai shifted positions, holding fast to the Sihang Warehouse. Because we were close to the concessions, and bullets were flying, endangering the lives and property of Chinese and foreigners, the Consular Body authorized Major General Smolan-Toru, Commander of British Defense Forces, and others to jointly request that our Supreme Commander order us to break through the blockade and retreat into the concession. For three years, we have been imprisoned here, and we have consistently maintained order and have not overstepped our bounds. Furthermore, all our expenses have been paid on time by our government, and the Shanghai Municipal Council has not borne a single cent. On August 8, 1938, the Flag Incident occurred. After the Shanghai Municipal Council sent representatives to negotiate, we were allowed to raise the national flag of the Republic of China on commemorative days, but we were subjected to violent suppression, resulting in the deaths of four soldiers and injuries to one hundred and seven, exceeding the price we paid for holding the Sihang Warehouse by more than three times. On the 1st and 2nd of this month, amidst heavy guard, barbed wire was erected, leading to conflict. The Shanghai Municipal Council used water cannons, liquid gas, and bayonets in cruel and oppressive ways for three years. At that time, twenty-five soldiers were injured, and on the 2nd, when soldiers spoke to pedestrians on the road, they were shot by White Russian detachments, resulting in one death and one serious injury on the spot. Since the 2nd, all communication with the outside world has been completely cut off, and food and vegetables are not allowed to be delivered. Citizens, moved by righteous indignation, throw items over the wall but are beaten and arrested. Electricity is also cut off because we allegedly have radios to listen to news from the outside world. International law stipulates that the treatment of prisoners must conform to humanitarian standards. I respectfully appeal to you to uphold justice for us and maintain international law and world civilization. I earnestly hope and pray. Xie Jinyuan, Regiment Commander of the Chinese Sihang Lone Army, bows in respect."

Situation Still Calm Yesterday

The English-language *Shanghai Evening Post* reports that the situation at the Lone Army Barracks on Jiaozhou Road was calm this morning (the 20th). Although the morale of the Lone Army remains uneasy, no further disturbances have been reported. A spokesperson for the Shanghai Municipal Council stated this morning that the situation remains unchanged and that the Council will only use the most peaceful means to restore order in the Lone Army Barracks. The Council is currently awaiting the Lone Army leaders to first take conciliatory action, without which the Council will not begin discussions or negotiations.

The Dead Temporarily Buried, the Wounded Sent to Hospital

During this incident at the Lone Army Barracks, the White Russian detachments recklessly used tear gas and opened fire. In addition to one person killed on the spot, more than twenty people were injured. It is now reported that the deceased was temporarily buried in the Lone Army Barracks yesterday. All the soldiers in the camp were deeply saddened. Gao Guangrong, who suffered a gunshot wound to his right leg, was also taken to Renji Hospital for treatment yesterday. Jia Yuexian was stabbed in the leg, and Chen De'an and Fan Shengbao suffered severe tear gas injuries and were also taken to the North Sea Road Police Station Hospital for treatment. More than twenty other injured people remain in the camp. Regiment Commander Xie Jinyuan did not allow them to be sent to the hospital.

Reader's Letter Expressing Concern

Yesterday, a reader of this newspaper, Yang Hui, wrote: "To the esteemed Editor, I am writing to express my indignation at the brutal treatment of the soldiers of the Lone Army Barracks on Jiaozhou Road on the 14th, followed by the tragic killing of our brave men in the French Concession, which words cannot describe. (Omission) Alas, let us not speak of the contempt of others. Are our compatriots, whom they defended with their lives, unmoved? Although this is the concession, and power is in the hands of others, our compatriots account for 99% of the population. In the social, industrial, and commercial sectors, they also hold considerable positions. If they could work together, they could negotiate with the local authorities. Today, the soldiers of the Lone Army are demanding the lifting of the blockade and the restoration of freedom. Setting aside the restoration of personal freedom, which is related to politics, the request to lift the blockade in order to obtain freedom of life and action is not excessive. Can all compatriots in the city not lend a helping hand? (Omission) I hope that you, sir, will convey my humble opinion on my behalf to comfort my loyal heart. With this special request, I wish you good health. Sincerely, Yang Hui, September 19th."

### German Embassy Hosts Press

Since the outbreak of the European war, Ke De, the Information Officer of the German Embassy in China, has held information meetings every Thursday at the International Hotel to maintain close contact with the Shanghai press. Due to the hot weather, the meetings were changed to once every two weeks and held at the German Embassy at No. 2 Beijing Road. Yesterday was Thursday, and Ke De hosted a dinner at the Xinya Restaurant on Nanjing Road at 8 PM to celebrate with reporters from Chinese newspapers. More than fifty representatives from various newspapers and news agencies attended. Ke De, Embassy Secretaries Jiao Huafu, Fei Zongzhi, Jiang Zhaofeng, General Manager Mei Zuishi and Editor-in-Chief Liu Zongyue of Haitong News Agency, and officials from the German Consulate in Shanghai were present to warmly greet the guests. The party ended with the guests and hosts enjoying themselves until after 10 PM.

### French Consul General in Shanghai, Orin, Leaves Shanghai Yesterday; Vacancy Temporarily Filled by Deputy Consul Duval; New Consul General Magli to Arrive in Shanghai Next Month

French Consul General in Shanghai, Orin, left Shanghai yesterday on the President Hoover mail ship. Government officials stated that Orin was returning to his country to take up a new position in the government. However, according to private French expatriates, Orin was leaving his consular position in the Vichy government to join General Tegor's movement. An official of the French Consulate resolutely denied the news that Orin had joined General Tegor's movement, saying that the news was completely inaccurate. Orin was traveling to the United States and then to France and has not left his consular duties.

Officer to England

The official also said that he had not heard anything about four French military officers leaving Shanghai soon for the United States and then to London. When asked by reporters whether the news that several French expatriates would also be leaving Shanghai soon for London was true, he only said that it might be the case. He said that the new Consul General Magli, who will succeed Orin, will arrive in Shanghai next month. Before the new Consul General arrives, Orin's vacancy will be temporarily filled by Deputy Consul Duval, who will act as Consul General.

Rumored Retirement

Another report states that French Consul General in Shanghai, Orin, left Shanghai yesterday with his wife and children on the President Hoover mail ship, traveling to France via the United States. Orin has served as the French Consul General in Shanghai for three years and has jointly managed the affairs of the French Consulate in Shanghai with Consul General Baudazzi, who left Shanghai and returned to France three months ago. It is not yet known whether Orin will continue to serve in the French diplomatic service after returning to France. It is generally believed that Orin may retire in accordance with the recent order issued by the Vichy government regarding the age limit for government officials. There is no official news about Orin's successor, but it is generally known that the Vichy government has appointed Mattiri La to succeed him. Mattiri's father once served as the French Ambassador to Germany.

### Mounted Police Unit to be Disbanded on Schedule; Farewell Drill to be Held; Inspection to be Held at Gordon Road Police Station on the Afternoon of the 23rd; Unit Has Been Established for 75 Years

The Shanghai Municipal Police Mounted Patrol Unit, which was previously proposed for disbandment by the Shanghai Municipal Council's Economic Committee and approved by the Board of Directors, is scheduled to hold its final inspection at the Gordon Road Police Station at 2 PM on the 23rd of this month. The Chairman of the Board of Directors, Ke Zaiwei, will serve as the inspecting officer.

Solemn Farewell Drill to be Held

The Shanghai Municipal Police Mounted Patrol Unit is scheduled to disband after a simple and solemn ceremony at the Gordon Road Police Station at 2 PM on the 23rd. The ceremony will take the form of a farewell drill. Chairman of the Board of Directors Ke Zaiwei and Chief of Police Bao Wen will attend the ceremony. They will first inspect the Mounted Patrol Unit with senior police officers, and then inspect the unit's drill. The Police Band will play music in the arena, and many police officers will also attend to observe.

Its History Dates Back a Long Time

The disbandment of the Mounted Patrol Unit is one of the many thrift plans recently announced by the Shanghai Municipal Council. All 26 members of the Mounted Patrol Unit will be incorporated into other departments of the Police Force. The exact date of the establishment of the Mounted Patrol Unit cannot be verified, as is the case with many other police records. Although historians have made great efforts to study it, they have not been able to determine it to this day. However, it is generally believed that the Mounted Patrol Unit was founded in 1865, as the budget of the Shanghai Municipal Council first contained an item for feed in that year.

Loss of Importance in the Age of Progress

Initially, the Mounted Patrol Unit patrolled Jing'an Temple Road (at that time, the road was still outside the concession). About 20 years later, the Indian Police Unit was established, and the number of Mounted Patrol Unit personnel also increased. Subsequently, the Indian Police Unit continued to increase, reaching 524 people today. The Mounted Patrol Unit gradually lost its initial value due to the appearance of motor vehicles and other mechanical transportation tools. However, it still maintained a strength of 26 mounted patrolmen, continuing its task of patrolling the roads outside the concession until its disbandment today.

Serving as Escorts, Imposing Appearance

For many years, the Mounted Patrol Unit has led the way in all grand parades and troop deployments. Their imposing appearance is well-known to the public. Of the 26 members of the Mounted Patrol Unit, there are two foreign and two Indian police officers, and 22 Indian constables, most of whom have served in the Indian Army. The unit has more than 40 steeds, most of which were donated by local horse owners. Now that the Mounted Patrol Unit has been disbanded, the horses will be returned to their original owners, including some famous horses that have excelled at the racecourse.

### Foreign Missionaries Arrive in Zhejiang by Indirect Routes to Provide Disaster Relief in Ningbo, Carrying a Large Quantity of Medicine

More than 30 missionaries of American, British, French, Italian, and other nationalities from major churches in Shanghai were previously stranded in Shanghai due to the interruption of shipping. They then took the Far East Company's Hana ship to the interior, but were intercepted by Japanese warships and forced to return. It is now learned that several of them have left Shanghai by ship and traveled to eastern Zhejiang, carrying a large quantity of daily medicines. They will provide medical assistance to residents injured in the bombing in Ningbo and other bombed areas.

### Haida Ship Entered Port Yesterday Morning, Carrying a Large Quantity of Foreign Rice, Estimated at More Than 26,000 Bags, to be Unloaded Today; Ship Was Detained at the Mouth of the Song River for Five Days

It is now learned that the China-Lune Shipping Company's Haida ship recently transported a large quantity of foreign rice directly from Saigon to Shanghai, estimated at more than 26,000 bags. On Thursday (the 15th), when it arrived at the mouth of the Wusong River and was about to enter the port, it suddenly saw a Japanese warship parked nearby flying a flag and ordered it to stop and anchor. The owner of the Haida ship saw this and immediately stopped and anchored. At that time, a small motorboat carrying many Japanese soldiers

Boarded the Ship for Inspection

They also questioned the crew and ordered the ship to sail to Tianjin. The owner of the ship refused, so they were not allowed to enter the port. Two Japanese soldiers were stationed on the ship. The owner of the ship immediately telegraphed the Shanghai office to report the situation. After receiving the telegram, the Shanghai office immediately reported it to the Norwegian Consulate in Shanghai, requesting negotiation for release. On the other hand, they also contacted the Japanese privately.

Release Was Granted Last Night

The ship then sailed into the Huangpu River at about 8 AM yesterday morning. At about 10 AM, it docked at the Hongxing Wharf in Pudong. The foreign rice will be unloaded today. The ship was detained outside the mouth of the Wusong River for five days. However, since the restoration of navigation in Shanghai's defense zone, the freight rates for foreign rice have been lower than before, and the production price has fallen. Therefore, rice merchants in Shanghai believe that once the foreign rice is sold and transported to Shanghai for sale,

Substantial Profits Can be Obtained

Therefore, they have been telegraphed abroad to place orders. According to sources, the source of domestic rice will continue to increase, and the autumn harvest can be predicted to begin in mid-September of the lunar calendar.

### Shi Jiutang Not Out of Danger; Bullet Still Lodged in Head

Lawyer Shi Jiutang, of Room 305, 3rd Floor, No. 24 Central Road, was suddenly shot at around 12 PM the day before yesterday. He was hit in the face and nose, blood gushing out, and he collapsed. The shooter fled without a trace. Shi was immediately rushed to Renji Hospital for treatment. Details have been reported in various newspapers. It was learned yesterday that after Shi entered the hospital, doctors diagnosed a fractured skull, and the bullet had not yet penetrated. Because Shi was confused, his pulse was weak, and his fever was high, he could not be operated on until yesterday evening. Therefore, Shi's fate is still uncertain.

### Industrial Section Organizes Safety Training; Great Importance to Industrial Safety; Trainees Scheduled to Register at the End of the Month

In order to improve worker skills and reduce work hazards, the Shanghai Municipal Council's Industrial Section has decided to organize an autumn industrial safety training course, specifically for factory owners, foremen, mechanics, and mold workers who use machine milling beds to manufacture cans, lamp holders, door locks, and other hardware items. Classes will be held from 7 PM, twice a week on Mondays and Thursdays, and are scheduled to be completed in six weeks. There is no fee. The subjects taught include: (1) Practical work in machine factories, (2) Casting of steel molds, (3) Selection and exploration of mold steel plates and their "heat" treatment methods, (4) Management and safety methods of gun beds, (5) Gun manufacturing methods, etc.

The class is scheduled to register students at 7 PM on September 30th at the Shanghai Municipal Council Health Sub-office at the Large Self-ringing Clock on Labosheng Road. Factories wishing to send their workers to participate in the training can first apply in writing to the Industrial Section, Room 602, Shanghai Municipal Council, No. 209 Jiangxi Road, and then instruct them to report to the above-mentioned lower point before 7 PM on September 30th.

### Difficulties Increase for Sending Parcels and Postal Money Orders; Parcel Post to Various Places Suspended; New Restrictions Added to Postal Money Orders in Zhejiang Province

According to news from the Remittance Office of the Shanghai Postal Administration, there have recently been changes to the postal money orders, remittance fees, and remittance limits from Shanghai to various post offices in the Zhejiang region. Starting today, in addition to the ordinary remittance fee, an additional 1.5 cents per yuan will be charged for postal money orders. To areas in the occupied territories, an additional 3.5 cents per yuan will be charged in addition to the ordinary remittance fee. These measures are due to the difficulty of postal delivery and transportation.

Remittance Limits

New restrictions on remittance limits have been added to the following areas: Changxing, Nanxun Pinghu, Weishan, Wuxing, Zhude, Aoyang, Maolin Village, and Sunjiabu. The maximum remittance amount for each person per day is limited to 30 yuan in the above areas. In Chang'an, Wangdian, and Shenqing, the maximum remittance amount per person per day is 50 yuan. In Tangqi Town, the maximum remittance amount is only 10 yuan per person per day. In Hangzhou and its branches, Heshanling, Yiqiao, Jiashan, Haxia Stone, Xiangshan, Xialu Bridge, and Linfu, the limit is 200 yuan per person per day. Remittances to Zhenhai, Chaiqiao, Linghu, Puyuan, Luotuo Bridge, Dazhe, Chongde, Yuhang, and Fanchang have been temporarily suspended.

Parcel Post Suspended

According to news from the Parcel Post Business Section of the Postal Administration, due to the invisible blockade of seaports in various places, land and water transportation has been suspended, and transportation is stagnant. All large and small parcels sent from Shanghai to various places have been temporarily suspended. The bureau's parcel business is unusually slack, resulting in a considerable loss. According to reporters from the Xinsheng News Agency, parcel post is currently only available to Qingdao, Yantai, Weihaiwei, Penglai, Longkou, Tianjin, Beiping, and Xiamen itself. Large commodity parcels are still available. As for the cities and counties along the Beijing-Shanghai Railway and the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, only personal parcels are currently available. Large and small parcels to Sichuan, Guizhou, Yunnan, and various cities and counties in eastern Zhejiang have been temporarily suspended and there is no date for resumption. Personal parcels may be available to other places, or they may be completely suspended. As for large commodity parcels sent from Shanghai to Guangzhou, the Shanghai Postal Bureau has resumed acceptance, with a limit of 30 kilograms per item. Those who wish to send such parcels must register with the Parcel Post Business Section of the Bureau before 11 AM one day in advance, otherwise, they will be refused delivery on the same day.

### Rumor that Japan is Sending Missionaries to China to Control Churches in Occupied Territories; Aim is to Exclude Foreign Church Leaders; Same Tactics Used in Korea

The Mainland News reports that, according to foreign missionaries in the city, the news that Japan is sending missionaries to China to spread "purely Japanese Christianity" shows that Japan will continue to intensify its control over churches in the occupied territories of China and

Exclude Foreign Church Leaders

And force them to leave their positions. It is expected that the Japanese authorities will strictly implement the religious laws implemented in Japan within the occupied territories, aiming to consolidate the churches and end foreign assistance to the churches. In terms of the implementation of religious laws, the Japanese are in the occupied territories of China and Korea

Same Tactics

The Japanese are now taking multiple steps in North China that are the same as those taken in Korea.

At the beginning of this summer, officials in Tokyo told reporters that Japan would allocate more than 10 million Japanese yen to take over the work of Christian churches in the occupied territories, which is part of Japan's plan to spread "purely Japanese Christianity" in China. According to the report of the Shanghai Municipal Council Health Department on the 19th of this month, there are currently 14 shelters with a total of 17,026 refugees.

### Lawsuit Over the Menger Nu Film; Zhang Niankun Appeals; Believes Amount of Judgment is Incorrect

Liu Zhonghao of Guohua Film Company entered into a contract with Zhang Niankun last spring, entrusting him to distribute the company's films such as "Menger Nu" in various ports in South China. In February of this year, after receiving the guarantee deposit for the film "Little Heroine," Guohua Company failed to deliver the film to Zhang Niankun for distribution as agreed and did not repay the agency fees and remuneration. Zhang Niankun then retained the films such as "Menger Nu" that Guohua Company had previously delivered. Guohua Company then commissioned lawyer Feng Xizui to file a lawsuit in the Special First Court to return the films, while Zhang Niankun also hired lawyers Lu Juntang and Juexian to file a counterclaim. As a result, the court ruled that Guohua Film Company should repay Zhang Niankun 1,800 yuan in national currency and 482 yuan, 3 jiao, and 4 cents in Hong Kong currency, and confirmed that Zhang Niankun had a lien on the company's "Menger Nu," "Romantic Wronged Soul," "Li Sanniang," and "New Hell" films for the aforementioned amount. It is now learned that Zhang Niankun believes that the amount of the judgment does not match the amount that Guohua Film Company should be responsible for paying under the contract, and therefore he is dissatisfied and has hired lawyers Lu and Tang to appeal to the Second High Court.

There is a piece of news in the newspaper that is worth exciting us. The headline is "The Shanghai Municipal Council Relieves the Suffering of Poultry and Livestock." The content says:

"The Municipal Council has received a letter from the Shanghai Animal Protection Society, stating that stores selling poultry and livestock in the area near Yuqiaqing Road and Guangdong Road often abuse poultry and livestock. Please ban them to comply with humanitarianism. After receiving the letter, the Bureau ordered the Health Department to send personnel to investigate and found it to be true. On yesterday, the fifth-third-one-six proclamation was issued, stating that: "It is known that merchants sell animals, including poultry, game, birds, and field chickens, etc., all should be treated in a humane manner. Sellers must find ways to prevent them from suffering unnecessary pain. If there is any violation of the provisions of this proclamation, the Bureau will file a lawsuit in accordance with the law." The Municipal Council has banned citizens from abusing animals more than once, but "the speaker speaks earnestly, the listener listens vaguely," and the effect seems to be small. We hope, from the bottom of our hearts, that this time the Municipal Council will earnestly implement this ban, and all citizens will also earnestly abide by it.

We not only hope that the abuse of animals will not be seen in Shanghai, but we also hope that the abuse of higher animals will disappear from now on!

### Essays A "Drenched Chicken"

— Gao Yang

Alas, heaven truly does not "bless" people. When I went out in the morning, although the sky wore a stern face and was a little gray, there was still a glimmer of sunlight in the east, and the wind wasn't strong. I thought it wouldn't rain, so I didn't bring any rain gear.

Actually, I was unusually excited today because I wanted to see our soldiers. So, even if it rained, I wouldn't have worried about it.

I don't know if it was my rich subjective imagination, or a real fact - even the verdant lawn in the park seemed tense. It seemed to be breathing the air of battle, but the armed people added to the corners, were they real?

Across the fence, our heroes were standing inside. Although there wasn't a good place to stand, the "plum blossom stakes" facing the air on all sides became "stable" sentry posts, where they stood firmly.

It rained. The raindrops seemed to be specially looking for dry clothes to soak. The people standing there were soaked. Those standing on this side put on raincoats, but the heroes on the "plum blossom stakes" still stood bravely and unmoved. Other people's material conditions are good, but our spirit is strong. In fact, this is also forged by the environment.

Someone was saying, "Oh, they're going to turn into 'drenched chickens' today!" I don't know if this was a joke or sympathy, but I always feel that this spirit is great and remarkable. Deep in my heart, I offer silent respect.

Hunger forced me to go home, but the raindrops refused to let up. However, the heroes standing on the "plum blossom stakes" did not change shifts to eat, and just let the water hang on their bodies. I felt ashamed.

Okay, others can endure hardship and not be afraid of the rain, can't I run? So, I mustered my courage, made up my mind, and walked home in the heavy rain.

Passing by the bus stop, it was very crowded with people waiting, but the ticket seller responded with two sounds of "ding ke," and the bus continued forward. The bus was very empty, but the door didn't open. The people drenched in the rain continued to be drenched. After the bus passed, a burst of abuse arose at the station, but the ticket seller didn't care.

At the corner, I met a modern girl, a colleague. Seeing me, she exclaimed, "Oh, a 'drenched chicken!'" I didn't answer, just nodded.

Wearing high heels, barefoot, her toes were red, holding an umbrella in her hand, calling for a rickshaw, muttering to herself: "Rain is annoying!"

In a blink of an eye, the rickshaw carrying the modern girl ran in front of me. Thinking of the situation just now, I couldn't help but feel solemn. I also felt sad for them!

Arriving home, my mother greeted me with a kind smile, "Your clothes are wet, change them quickly, you'll get sick... Why didn't you take the bus?"

"It's okay, Mom, the wind will dry them!"

Miscellaneous Thoughts

### A Chapter of Occasional Thoughts

— Ge Mo Feng

I detest the so-called "relying on seniority," especially when veteran writers often have no seniority to sell. After printing one or two "masterpiece collections," or plagiarizing and patching together a "guideline" or "outline" of sorts, or after releasing a "××'s Poems" with "oh-oh" sounds, they actually join the ranks of scholars, poets, or writers. From then on, they become like bulls, unable to produce even a drop of milk. If they still want to rely on their age, then dwelling on decay as something magical is probably also embarrassing, right?

However, the degree to which boastful "young writers" "rely on youth" is sometimes even more disgusting: grabbing a banner, scribbling some "great works," and then thinking they have surpassed everyone else; thus, they become arrogant, unthinking, and look down on the world. Even more despicable ones degenerate into "literary thugs," using yelling and threats as a career, and using ridicule and abuse as a shortcut to fame. In their arrogant and unbridled minds: "There are no predecessors, and no successors." Only themselves, it's truly lamentable!

Self-overflowing, boasting, and arrogance, for a literary and artistic worker, to borrow a phrase from Chekhov; these are precisely the horseflies that hinder the horse from plowing! I think: it's better to be more humble and diligent. What should be strengthened is not others, but also "oneself"!

"I don't dare to consider myself an Arabian thoroughbred horse, but just a pack horse. My achievements... are mostly due to my ability to work, my love of work." This is Gorky's humble and sincere confession. If you think it's not worth learning, then these kinds of "young writers" can give up!

Hawthorne's Detective Work

### The Homecoming of the Dance Queen

— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter Seven "Take him into Custody"

He asked me, "You're carrying a gun on you now, right?"

I replied, "Yes, it's that little gun from the drawer upstairs. Do you think Number Seventy-One would have seen Zhao Boxiong?"

"Probably so. Do you have cash on you? Fifty or sixty yuan will do."

"Yes, is it the reward for Number Seventy-One?"

"Yes, I didn't bring much cash. This guy worked hard because of my promise, so of course, I need to pay him in cash. He might not trust a check."

At this time, the car's speed was very fast, almost exceeding the prescribed limit. My nerves were also tense to a considerable degree.

I also asked, "Do you think Zhao Boxiong could be the murderer?"

Hawthorne replied, "It's hard to say. But based on the facts we already know, this person is indeed an important protagonist in this drama."

The car stopped in front of the side door of Yadong. Hawthorne put on those dark crystal glasses again, stuck on the fake mustache, and did another temporary disguise. He walked into the hotel door, his right hand inserted into the pocket of his navy blue serge short jacket, his eyes constantly shifting left and right, adopting a serious state of vigilance. I followed behind, of course, also cautiously. We stood in front of the elevator door for a while. When the elevator descended, six or seven people came out. I also observed carefully, not seeing any suspicious figures. The elevator went straight up to the seventh floor. We walked out and went straight to the west end of the corridor, just in time to see the Number Seventy-One waiter walking over. Hawthorne quickly grabbed his arm. The waiter was stunned, apparently Hawthorne's disguise had some effect. Hawthorne pulled him to the turning point where we had talked before, and spoke in a low voice.

Hawthorne said, "A-Gen, I'm Hawthorne. Have you seen him yet?"

Number Seventy-One looked at Hawthorne for a moment before nodding and replying, "Yes, Mr. Hawthorne. He has changed his appearance. He was originally wearing a suit, but I just saw him wearing a dark blue wool robe and a brown felt hat—"

Hawthorne interrupted him, his eyes seeming to burst with fire. "Does he have a short beard on his lips? Is he wearing glasses?"

"Yes, Mr. Hawthorne, have you seen him too?" (113)

### Regarding the Death of Saake

— Yi Yi

The city's most well-organized amateur theater groups, China United, Silver United, and Bao United, will hold a joint performance this Sunday (the 22nd) at 10:00 AM at the Xuan Palace Theater. Tickets are priced at 60 cents and 40 cents. The programs are China United's "The Death of Saake," Silver United's "A Corner of the Metropolis," and Bao United's "A Wasp," all one-act plays.

When I pick up the pen to write this nondescript thing, I have joy and worry, because recently I have been troubled by this contradictory psychology. I am a child who doesn't understand anything, and of course drama is no exception. Directing is even more out of the question. This time, I was actually assigned to be the director of "The Death of Saake." I really don't believe in myself. I really feel a little at a loss. Fortunately, the actors in the play are all my good classmates and good friends, so I resolutely decided to rehearse this play boldly. But today, I can't help but feel a little chilly. Will a good work be damaged because of me? Will the acting talents of my friends be hindered by me? I am really worried about these two points!

The story of "The Death of Saake" unfolds on the stage, telling the contradictory psychology of Colonel Saake, commander of the air force during the Spanish Civil War. Because he loves his own children and also loves his great motherland, his reason and emotion are constantly clashing, but the country's laws are only one, and the country cannot sacrifice its great future because of his son's relationship. In the end, Saake resolutely decided everything and finally made a heroic sacrifice for the motherland. His son, Louis, an air force captain, is a handsome and promising young man. Although his father's death inevitably makes him sad, he immediately uses reason to overcome emotion and quickly decides to serve the country and never follow in his father's footsteps. - The old is dead, and new life, new strength is constantly growing!

The entire script unfolds from the opening to the closing without a minute passing in passion, tension, stimulation, and grandeur. It can also give a head-on blow to the generally昏迷 compatriots in Shanghai today. In short, "The Death of Saake" is indeed a good play, worthy of our rehearsal and presentation to everyone.

### Supplement to Wang Men Taoli (Peaches and Plums)

— Sick Pigeon

In my previous work "Talking About Wang Yaoqing's Disciples," the list of Wang's disciples was based solely on memory and had not been carefully checked. Now that I have received corrections from Weiwei, I will continue to record the omissions from the previous article. However, Yaoqing has many disciples, and the author's knowledge is limited, so it is difficult to avoid leaving out some pearls.

Male actors: Ding Yunqiu, Su Xiaoyu (amateur), Song Dezhu, Jin Biyan, Cao Hewen (drama school student)

Female actors: Ma Yanyun, Hu Bilan, Zhao Shenyun, Zhu Yanhua, Deng Deqin, Zhao Jinrong, Zhang Jinfeng, Feng Yufu, Wang Jinlan, Jin Heming

Hou Yulan (the above seven are all students of the opera school)

Regarding Jiang Miaoxiang, Wang Huifang, and Mei Shang among the four famous dan, the old opera fans all know this. Wang, Jiang, Mei, and Shang are called disciples of Delin, but they have not formally apprenticed. Delin's true disciple is only Wang Qinong. At that time, the disciples respected Delin as an old gentleman because of his age. The situation was the same as Wang, Jiang, and Mei respecting Yaoqing as a teacher. I flipped through the Journal of Drama Studies published by the Peking Branch of the Nanjing Academy of Opera and Music, Volume 3, Issue 7, and found an article titled "Two Revolutionarys of Peking Opera Sheng and Dan," written by a famous writer, narrating the artistic experiences of Tan Xinpei and Wang Yaoqing in detail, with thousands of words, which can be called an immortal masterpiece. The article on Wang's disciples includes the disciples of Gu Maoxuan (Gu Maoxuan is Yaoqing's pseudonym) at the end. All the actors listed in the previous article are listed, and short articles are attached to record their brief histories. Now, I will record the appendix of Jiang, Wang, Mei, and Shang to conclude this article.

Jiang Miaoxiang: Yaoqing explained a lot of plays for Miaoxiang. At that time, Yaoqing was only in his twenties and slept very early. Whenever Miaoxiang came, Yaoqing would invite people to the bedroom, teach while lying down. When Miaoxiang changed to Xiaosheng and no longer played Qingyi, Yaoqing still explained plays such as "Yanmen Pass" and "Yang Balang."

Wang Huifang: Wang Huifang asked Yaoqing for advice the most. Although she did not formally apprentice, she had the reality but not the name. When Yaoqing was in his prime, Huifang often worked with him.

Mei Lanfang: Lanfang initially treated Yaoqing as an elder brother. His uncle, Yutian, once ordered him to take Yaoqing as a teacher. Some say that he had a formal apprenticeship ceremony, others say that he had not. Lanfang always called him "Mr." and sometimes called him "Big Brother," which is even more unclear. Most of his skills in the play were obtained from Wang, and most of the new tunes were created by Yaoqing's son, Shaoqing, not entirely Yaoqing's effort. The entire "Xi Shi" was mostly directed by Yaoqing.

Shang Xiaoyun: Xiaoyun learned plays such as "Fu Shou Jing" from Yaoqing.

### Shanghai Opera Company Rehearsal

Since its establishment, the Shanghai Opera Company has been enthusiastically managed by President Yuan Ludeng, Ye Jun, Shi Zhibo, and Ren Zhang Boren. The company's affairs are developing exceptionally well. The original company address was greatly expanded the other day, and the internal equipment has been completely improved. The second rehearsal will be held at the Ningbo Association Hall today, and the programs are all very exciting.

Brief News: (1) The Lily Literary Magazine, Issue 7, will be published on the Double Tenth Festival, soliciting excellent works from all writers, including movies, dramas, women, children, and poetry. Submissions should be sent to the Shanghai post office, box number 2020.

### Shang Xiaoyun Will Go to Japan to Perform

— Hai Xing

Recently, I received a letter from a friend in Peiping, stating that Shang Xiaoyun's performance in Japan has been finalized. He is expected to depart in early October for a period of one month, with a fee of 70,000 yuan. Shang Xiaoyun knows that foreigners' appreciation of Peking opera does not spark interest in Xusheng, but they love Wusheng and Wudan. Therefore, he plans to invite Zhou Ruian, Yan Shishan, etc., to cooperate and travel together. Zhou and Yan may decline the invitation, citing that the Peiping troupe is too busy. It is also said that many people have advised Xiaoyun against this move, but it seems that it is impossible to recover, lamenting what to do.
