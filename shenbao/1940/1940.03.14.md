London: Moscow radio confirms that the Soviet Union and Finland have concluded a peace treaty and that the armistice has taken effect this afternoon (i.e., 8:00 PM Shanghai time today). (Reuters, 13th)

Berlin: The terms of the Soviet-Finnish peace include the following five points: (1) The entire Karelian Isthmus, the entire shore of Lake Ladoga, the Fisherman's Peninsula, and part of eastern Finland are ceded to the Soviet Union. (2) Hango Island is leased to the Soviet Union as a naval base for a period of 30 years, with an annual rent of five million Finnish marks. (3) A railway will be built this year from the Kandalaksha naval base to Kemijärvi. (4) Troops will withdraw to the new border by 10:00 AM on March 15th. (5) The Petsamo area is a demilitarized zone. (Reuters, 13th)

Moscow: The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the Republic of Finland have signed a peace treaty. The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union and the Finnish organization jointly desire to end the war and establish peace relations. At the same time, they firmly believe that guaranteeing mutual security conditions (including the security of Leningrad, Murmansk, and the Murmansk Railway) fully aligns with the interests of both parties. Therefore, both parties deem it necessary to sign a peace treaty.

The Soviet and Finnish governments have appointed the following representatives: Molotov, Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars and People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union; Zhdanov, Member of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet; Lieutenant General Vasilevsky; President Ryti of Finland; Minister without Portfolio Paasikivi; General Walden; and Professor Vuorma. (TASS, 13th)

Moscow: After 104 days of fighting between the Soviet Union and Finland, the territory Finland has agreed to cede is far greater than what the Soviet side demanded before the war. As for the Karelian Isthmus, it has now been entirely ceded to the Soviet Union. Vyborg, Finland's second-largest city (with a population of 74,000), is also included in the cession, which was not part of the demands last autumn. The old Finnish border was only twenty kilometers from Leningrad, but now it is one hundred and twenty kilometers away. Historically, the Karelian Isthmus, including Vyborg, once belonged to Russia, which is when Russian troops captured Vyborg in 1710. At that time, all of Finland belonged to Sweden. As for the Hango Peninsula, due to its strategic location, it is not only located at the northwest entrance of the Gulf of Finland, but also because it had a naval port built during the Imperial Russian era, it is sufficient to control the Gulf of Finland and affect Leningrad. Therefore, the Soviet Union demanded the construction of a military base on the peninsula, and this goal has also been achieved in this peace treaty. (Haitong Telegraph, 13th)

### Full Text of the Soviet-Finnish Peace Treaty

Moscow: The contents of the Soviet-Finnish Peace Treaty are as follows:

(1) According to the procedures stipulated in the annex to this treaty, the Soviet Union and Finland shall immediately cease hostilities.

(2) The border between the Soviet Union and Finland will be established along the new boundary. According to this new boundary, the territory of the Soviet Union will include the entire Karelian Isthmus: the town of Vyborg, Vyborg Bay, the west and north shores of Lake Ladoga, Käkisalmi, Sortavala, the town of Suojärvi, some islands in the Gulf of Finland, the town of Koivisto in the Terijoki area, and some parts of the Rybachi and Sredny Peninsulas (the above sections are detailed in the attached map). The more detailed definition of the border will be determined by a mixed commission of signatories from both sides. This mixed commission must be established within ten days of the signing of the treaty.

(3) Both signatory countries must avoid mutual acts of aggression and must not ally or cooperate with countries that oppose either side.

(4) The Republic of Finland agrees to lease the Hango Peninsula to the Soviet Union for a period of 30 years, with the Soviet Union paying a rent of eight million Finnish marks per year. The leased territory includes the territory within five miles around the eastern and southern parts of the island and within three miles around the western and northern parts, as well as nearby islands (detailed in the attached map). The purpose of this lease is: (1) to establish a naval base to defend the entrance to the Gulf of Finland; (2) for the purpose of defending this base, the Soviet Union has the right to station the necessary naval, land, and air forces there. All expenses will still be borne by the Soviet Union. Within ten days of the treaty taking effect, the Finnish government must withdraw its troops from the Hango Peninsula and nearby islands and transfer jurisdiction there to the Soviet Union.

(5) The Soviet Union agrees to withdraw its troops from Petsamo (which was voluntarily ceded to Finland by the Soviet Union under the 1920 Treaty). At the same time, in accordance with the 1920 Treaty, Finland must also avoid stationing armed vessels along the Arctic Ocean coast, except for those with a displacement of less than 100 tons. In addition, armed vessels under 400 tons may also be stationed there, but not exceeding 15 vessels. Also, in accordance with the same treaty, Finland may not station submarines and aircraft there, and may not establish military ports, naval bases, or naval repair facilities exceeding necessary needs along the coast there.

(6) In accordance with the 1920 Treaty, the Soviet Union and its people have the right to pass through Petsamo to and from Norway. At the same time, the Soviet Union may open a consulate in Petsamo. Transportation goods traveling to and from the Soviet Union and Norway via Petsamo shall not be subject to inspection and control, except for those that must be controlled under transportation regulations. Also, these transportation goods do not need to pay tariffs and other taxes. The management methods for the aforementioned transportation goods must comply with international practice. Also, Soviet citizens holding passports issued by Soviet agencies may freely travel to and from Norway and the Soviet Union via Petsamo. At the same time, Soviet civilian aircraft may cross Petsamo to and from the Soviet Union and Norway.

(7) The Finnish government grants the Soviet Union the right to transport goods between the Soviet Union and Sweden. To develop this cargo transport, both parties believe that it is necessary to build the shortest railway line. To the extent possible, both parties will build new railways on their respective territories this year, linking the towns of Kandalaksha and Kemijärvi.

(8) When this peace treaty takes effect, the economic relations between the signatory countries will be restored, and efforts will be made to continue to conclude trade agreements.

(9) This peace treaty shall take effect immediately after signing and shall be ratified by both parties. The procedures for exchanging ratification documents shall be held in Moscow within ten days.

This peace treaty has two original copies, each in Russian, Finnish, and Swedish. The date is March 12, 1940, and the location is Moscow. The signatories are Molotov, Zhdanov, Vasilevsky, Ryti, Paasikivi, Walden, and Vuorma. (TASS, 13th)

### Annex Contains Eight Items: Stipulates Procedures for Armistice and Troop Withdrawal

Moscow: According to the annex to the Soviet-Finnish Peace Treaty of March 12, 1940, both parties have decided on the following procedures for armistice and troop withdrawal: (1) Both parties will cease hostilities at noon on March 13, 1940 (Leningrad time, 8:00 PM Shanghai time on March 13). (2) From the time of the armistice, a neutral zone (one kilometer wide) will be established between the advancing troops of both sides. Also, if the troops of one party discover that they have entered the territory of the other party under the new border principles on the first day, they must immediately withdraw one kilometer. (3) When the troops of one party withdraw from the new border, the troops of the other party will advance to the new border to take up positions. This withdrawal and advance procedure will begin at 10:00 AM on March 15, 1940, from the Gulf of Finland to the area of Riikisaari, and at 10:00 AM on March 16, 1940, north of Riikisaari. The daily withdrawal speed must not be less than seven kilometers, and the advancing troops and the withdrawing troops should maintain a distance of seven kilometers. (4) Regarding the withdrawal deadline, both parties, in accordance with Article 3 of the annex, stipulate as follows: (A) The withdrawal procedure for troops on both sides from the Taipaleenjoki River, Koivisto, and Taipale to the eastern shore of Lake Joukamojärvi shall be completed by 8:00 PM on March 20, 1940. (B) In the Ladva district of Kumunjoki, the troop withdrawal procedure shall be completed by 8:00 PM on March 22, 1940. (C) At the Logivaara, Värtsilä, and Matkaselkä stations, the troop withdrawal shall be completed by 8:00 PM on March 26, 1940. (D) In the area of Matkaselkä Station and Kolatselkä, the withdrawal procedure shall be completed by 8:00 PM on March 22 at noon. (E) From Kolatselkä to Ensi, the withdrawal procedure shall be completed by 8:00 PM on March 25. (F) From Ensi Station and Pietarin Island, the withdrawal procedure shall be completed by 8:00 PM on March 19. (5) The Red Army's withdrawal procedure from Petsamo shall be completed by April 10, 1940. (6) The commanders of both parties agree to take necessary steps in various cities and towns during the withdrawal to prevent the destruction of cities and buildings with defensive and economic characteristics (such as bridges, water gates, airfields, barracks, military depots, railway junctions, industrial facilities, telegraph and power plants). (7) All problems that occur in the transfer area (i.e., the areas stipulated in Article 6) shall be resolved by local representatives of both parties. In this regard, both command headquarters will appoint commissioners to monitor the main locations of troop movements. (8) After the cessation of hostilities, both parties will exchange prisoners of war in the shortest possible time. This procedure is based on a special agreement.

The signatories of the aforementioned annex are Molotov, Zhdanov, Vasilevsky, Ryti, Paasikivi, Walden, Vuono, and Vuorma. (TASS, 13th)

### Tanner Explains Reasons for Reconciliation; Finland Flies National Flag at Half-Mast in Mourning

Helsinki: Finnish Foreign Minister Tanner recently gave a 20-minute radio broadcast, announcing that the Soviet-Finnish armistice agreement took effect at 10:00 AM this morning. At that time, all hostilities ended. Tanner also released an outline of the peace terms received by the Finnish government and said that these terms must be ratified by the Finnish Parliament. Tanner continued, "Finland is a small country. This war has been an unequal struggle from the beginning. We are not responsible for the war. We originally did not believe in the outbreak of war. When it could not be avoided, we were forced to fight for self-defense. Although we relied on the dedication of our officers and soldiers, we felt a lack of both manpower and materials. We have received overseas assistance, but it is still insufficient. Not long ago, Western powers proposed military assistance. After careful study by the Finnish military authorities, a weakness was discovered, namely, the problem of troop transport. The Scandinavian countries refused the requests of both Finland and the Western powers. As a result, Finland had to recognize that this assistance was unreliable. The Finnish government, in light of this, believed that it would be better to pursue peace before Finland was defended, so it signed a treaty last night. People will naturally have different opinions on this issue and will advocate continuing the war. However, at present, we must strive to build and consolidate peace and concentrate all our efforts on this task. We must forget the past and look to the future." Tanner continued, "The conditions proposed by the Soviet Union are not more severe than those proposed last autumn. Our representatives tried unsuccessfully to revise them. The Soviet Union did not put forward political conditions and did not interfere in our internal affairs. The People's Government has now shelved everything. The price of this peace is extremely high, which is why the government hesitated greatly to accept the terms." The above broadcast was the first Finnish confirmation of the peace news transmitted by Moscow. The people were silent when they heard the news, and many men and women shed tears. However, the Finnish people all seemed to have the idea that if the Finnish Army General Commander, Mannerheim, and the government decided to end the fighting, then continuing the war would be tantamount to suicide. After the news from Tanner, the flags on various military buildings were immediately flown at half-mast. (Reuters, 12th)

### Finland Loses Territory: 15,000 Square Miles

Berlin: According to a Soviet official news agency report, the Moscow Communist Party organ Pravda published the contents of the Soviet-Finnish peace treaty. Finland, according to the treaty, must cede approximately one-tenth of its territory, which is about 15,000 square miles, depending on how vast the strip of land ceded to the Soviet Union near Terijoki is, and how the boundary line from Sortavala to Porosozero is drawn. According to Pravda, the new Soviet-Finnish border line stipulated in the treaty starts from the Gulf of Finland about 30 miles west of Vyborg and runs roughly straight 15 miles north of Vyborg and about 15 miles north of Sortavala (Note: Sortavala is located on the northern shore of Lake Ladoga). Therefore, the railway line from Vyborg to Sortavala is still within the land that the Soviet Union should receive. The boundary line still trends northeast to the former border near the Soviet town of Porosozero. The former boundary to the Arctic Circle has not been changed. The Soviet Union obtained a narrow strip of land northeast of Rovaniemi within the Salla region, including the village of Kuolajärvi opposite the Soviet town of Kandalaksha. The Soviet Union also obtained the Rybachi (Fisherman's Peninsula) and the Sredny Peninsula in the Petsamo Bay in the far north. Except for changes that benefit the Finnish side, the new border is the same as the line drawn in the Treaty of Uusikaupunki in 1721. (Reuters, 13th)

Editorial

### The Cause and Effect of the Restoration of Peace Between Finland and the Soviet Union

The cessation of hostilities and reconciliation between Finland and the Soviet Union was discussed by this newspaper yesterday as the key to whether the negotiations would succeed or fail, "the key to whether the European war would expand or not, and the key to whether the world situation would gradually stabilize or become more dangerous," and "We hope with utmost sincerity to achieve a satisfactory solution." However, just overnight, news came yesterday morning that the two sides had signed the agreement. An important link in international disputes has been resolved, and an abnormal extreme of human reason has been overcome. This is something to be gratifying about, something not encountered for a long time.

The Finnish-Soviet war broke out at the end of November last year. It lasted 104 days of bloody fighting until the signing of the agreement yesterday morning. Before the war, there were very long diplomatic negotiations between the two countries, and the contents of the negotiations and the truth of the breakdown were not made public. Summarizing what has been revealed by various parties, it is only known that the Soviet Union's demands on Finland at that time were very extravagant. The main terms of this peace agreement were informally released yesterday by the Soviet state-run TASS news agency. The situation of territorial transfers can be roughly seen, but the detailed boundaries need to be surveyed and determined by a mixed commission organized by both sides. Therefore, there is no formal data to make a practical comparison between the pre-war demands and the post-war compromise. However, the severity of the pre-war demands was to the extent that Finland would rather be destroyed than accept them, and thus waged a desperate battle. The extent of the current compromise plan is that Finland believes that it can maintain the independence and freedom of the nation, and thus sacrifices what can be sacrificed to stabilize the country. Thus, it can be inferred that what the Soviet Union sought and obtained was a concession compared to before the war. In addition to the territorial issue, the peace treaty has a clause of a political nature, that is, Article 3 stipulates that "Both signatory countries must avoid mutual acts of aggression and must not ally or cooperate with countries that oppose either side." This kind of mutual and passive restriction does not hinder Finland's sovereignty, nor does it hinder the Soviet Union's sovereignty, and it is a common clause in various non-aggression agreements in recent international relations.

If the peace treaty is like this, then the question will arise: Why did Finland and the Soviet Union go to war in the first place? Humans occasionally have times when reason is abnormal, and there are always things in the world that people regret doing. At that time and in that matter, people can only sigh and cannot answer why. This is not only the case with the Finnish-Soviet war. Forcibly trying to explain it and seeking an answer, it can be said that the Soviet Union did not fundamentally have a planned initiation of this hundred-day war; Finland's heroic act of going to death was a masterpiece. It is impossible to avoid being generous in going to death. The Soviet Union did not intend to go to war at first, but it still went to war, and it ended in peace despite its superior military power. Moreover, the compensation obtained after the war was not as severe as the demands made in the pre-war diplomatic negotiations. Therefore, the Moscow telegram yesterday stated: "This is a great proof of the Soviet government's commitment to peace." It cannot be regarded as exaggeration and hypocrisy, and I agree with it.

However, the current question is not why Finland and the Soviet Union went to war in the first place, but why they are now negotiating peace? Saying that the reason for going to war was the restoration of reason and the Soviet Union's commitment to peace seems correct, but it is insufficient. If the peace agreement had not been reached, or if the parties had not negotiated peace, there were two obvious possibilities for success: the Soviet Union, with its majestic power, could have taken advantage of the spring season to attack Finland. It would not have been an exaggeration to say that it would have been as easy as catching a rabbit. Destroying the reality and supporting a puppet government is something that the Soviet Union could have achieved through war, one. Finland could have asked for assistance from Britain and France, and Britain and France could have assisted Finland in resisting Russia. Finland had already obtained promises from Britain and France, and Britain and France had also expressed their readiness to depart with their troops. Thus, the two groups of wars in Europe would have merged into one. During the First European War, Belgium lost all of its territory, but was eventually able to stand tall after the war. Using that example, Finland could have achieved this through war, two. In the midst of artillery fire and flying flesh and blood, new and old feuds had almost become irreconcilable. If there had been no remaining strength, no future, and they had had to stop the war, it would have been understandable. Now, however, both sides have the possibility of continuing to fight and striving for final victory, but they have ended in peace. Shouldn't this be considered an anomaly in the wartime mass psychological state?

What goes on behind the scenes is something that we who are outside the situation cannot know. Looking back and forth, let's try to make an educated guess, and there are things that can be said: the Soviet Union's international policy is based on peaceful coexistence. Last year, it first sent troops to Poland, followed by sending troops to Finland. Although the reactions were very different, the original intention of sending troops was not to go to war, and there was absolutely no difference between the two. Criticizing Britain and France and siding with Germany, the close relationship and tight coordination between the Soviet Union and Germany was even greater than that of the countries with alliance treaties, such as Germany and Italy. It almost delighted in wiping out Britain and France, but it has not participated in the war from the beginning while helping Germany to fight. It is limited by the core of its international policy. Only because of this core can the war be stopped if it can be stopped. If the war is not stopped now, although there is the possibility of controlling the entire territory of Finland, it will inevitably confront Britain and France head-on. The Soviet Union is extremely concerned about who wins and who loses in the war between Britain and France and Germany, but confronting Britain and France and then siding with Germany is something that the Soviet Union's national policy does not allow. What's more, even if the war is stopped, there are already gains. As for Finland, it knows that Britain and France can be obtained with just one call, and that fighting side by side with Britain and France would not only have the possibility of recovering the lost territory, but also the hope of expanding its territory. However, if it does not stop the war now, the whole country will become a battlefield for the war between Britain and France and the Soviet Union and Germany, which is inevitable. Therefore, with the generous aid promised by Britain and France, it keenly perceived the Soviet Union's national policy of not going to war, and wanted to exchange peace for concessions. Territory was ceded, but the nation's independence and freedom were unharmed. Isn't this the strategy of the two countries' peace and war?

The international impact of the successful reconciliation between Finland and the Soviet Union is complex and far-reaching, and it is also subtle and difficult to describe. The changes will be difficult to grasp. Let's briefly describe it from the bright side: Finland can take a sigh of relief. In the future, with its excellent nation, it will manage a smaller world and will definitely have a different kind of brilliance. The Soviet Union, in addition to the gains from the peace agreement, has extricated itself from the quagmire. From now on, it will get rid of the coercion that is most easily suffered during wartime, and get rid of the intolerable demands that had to be tolerated during wartime, and will be able to maintain an independent position and a lively function in the international arena. Sweden and Norway, at a time when disaster was imminent, turned danger into safety and felt as if a heavy burden had been lifted. It will also be easier for them to maintain their neutral policies towards Britain, France, and Germany as the threat is lifted. Britain and France are pleased that Finland has obtained peace and has not become a vassal of the Soviet Union. In the future, their concerns in Northern Europe will be reduced, and the possibility of reconciliation with the Soviet Union will be increased. Germany has greater hope of obtaining Soviet economic assistance. The small countries along the Baltic Sea and the North Sea have reduced the atmosphere of gunpowder on one side. The United States, which has been painstakingly trying to deal with the three groups of wars in the world, will be able to concentrate the power it devotes to the three groups in the future and deal with two groups. The power and possible effectiveness of its efforts will of course increase in inverse proportion. China and Japan will not directly gain from the peace agreement in that region, but will indirectly benefit from the Soviet Union and the United States!

### Ambassador Yang Jie Returns to Chongqing; Soviet Aid to China Will Be More Active; Believes Soviet-Japanese Rapprochement Is Impossible; Powers Do Not Attach Importance to Puppet Regime

Kunming: According to Yang Jie, the Chinese ambassador to the Soviet Union, who arrived here yesterday, after the cessation of hostilities between the Soviet Union and Finland, Soviet aid to China will definitely increase further. At the same time, Britain and France are not interested in the organization of Wang Jingwei's "new government." As for the Soviet Union and Japan concluding a non-aggression treaty, this is impossible because the ceasefire at Nomonhan was the result of Japan's defeat, and Japan has never been sincere towards the Soviet Union. (United Press, 13th)

Chongqing: The Ta Kung Pao here reported a special dispatch from Kunming saying that General Yang Jie, the Chinese ambassador to the Soviet Union, arrived in Kunming from the Soviet Union yesterday morning. When he met with reporters, he said that the Soviet-Finnish war would be resolved soon, and that the Soviet Union would increase its aid to China afterwards. There is no possibility of reconciliation between the Soviet Union and Japan. The Soviet Union, Britain, and France do not pay much attention to Wang Jingwei's activities. As far as the European war is concerned, there is no sign of an early end to the war. He was satisfied with his work in the Soviet Union. It is reported that Yang Jie left Moscow at the beginning of this year and returned to China. On the way, he visited several European countries. He will fly from Kunming to Chongqing to report to the government soon, and then go to his hometown of Dali, Yunnan, to reunite with his family. General He Yaodu is now in Moscow, representing the Chinese government during Yang Jie's absence. (Reuters, 13th)

### Chongqing Observers View the European Situation as Beneficial to China; Soviet Union to Shift Attention to the Far East; Eastern Newspaper Commentary Expresses Doubts Towards the Soviet Union

Chongqing – According to political circles here today, after the end of the Soviet-Finnish war, the Soviet Union's attention will shift to the Far East, presumably to aid China. It is claimed that Soviet assistance to China has lasted twenty years, which can be considered historically significant. As for rumors that the Soviet Union would vacate the Siberian Railway for Japan to restore its trade with Europe, enhance Japan's economic position, and simultaneously conclude a non-aggression treaty with Japan, allowing Japan to transfer its troops stationed in the Northeast to Inner Mongolia to attack the government it aids, this is considered unthinkable. Furthermore, according to the Chinese Communist Party's newspaper "Xinhua Daily," Soviet diplomacy is entirely based on love of peace and opposition to aggression. The victory of the Soviet Union's peaceful policy is entirely consistent with the interests of all peace-loving nations worldwide. Another element of Soviet diplomacy is its sympathetic assistance to invaded countries seeking independence. (United Press, 13th)

Chongqing – Chongqing Chinese sources received the news of the Soviet-Finnish peace without surprise, but with mixed emotions. The general Chinese population welcomes the news of the peace agreement, believing that the peaceful resolution of the Soviet-Finnish war will reduce the risk of the Soviet Union being drawn into the European war and will alleviate the Soviet Union's concerns about the western front, allowing it to pay more attention to the overall situation in the Far East. On the other hand, it is heard that the terms of the peace agreement are quite important. If the terms do not hinder Finland's independence and sovereignty, then China welcomes the agreement. However, if the treaty aims to subjugate Finland, then there is a sense of anxiety here, fearing that this will set a dangerous precedent for the future. In addition to interpreting the Soviet-Finnish situation from a perspective favorable to China, it is also said that the Soviet-Finnish peace is nothing more than an important victory for Soviet-German diplomacy. It is feared that the events in Austria, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and now Finland will make small countries doubt the guarantees of the Allied powers, as the Allied powers, although issuing guarantees and statements that they are fighting for small countries and resisting aggression, do not provide effective assistance to small countries. (Reuters, 13th)

Tokyo – The "Asahi Shimbun" reported that Japanese Foreign Ministry officials attach great importance to the Soviet-Finnish peace agreement. It is believed that it will not only have a significant impact on the attitude of the Scandinavian countries but is also expected to strengthen the policies of the Soviet Union and Germany towards the Far East. Furthermore, the "Nichinichi Shimbun" believes that the Soviet Union will now adopt a more resolute attitude in the Far East. In this regard, the newspaper reported that the Soviet Union recently expressed an ambiguous attitude towards Japan's efforts to resolve various pending issues related to the Manchurian border and fishing rights in the Kamchatka Sea. (Reuters, 13th)

### Soviet Union Sees It as Satisfactory, Finland with Hidden Pain

Moscow – The Communist Party's official mouthpiece, "Pravda," commented on the Soviet-Finnish peace agreement, saying that the Soviet Union's responsibility has been completed, and the security of the Soviet Union's northwest border and Leningrad has been guaranteed. Today, after the end of the war on the front lines, the Soviet people will feel very satisfied. This peace agreement has established permanent peaceful relations between the two countries. (Reuters, 13th)

Moscow – Political figures here are very satisfied with the conclusion of the Soviet-Finnish peace treaty, aiming to quickly end the negotiations, not only to stop the war between the two countries but also to consolidate peace in Northern Europe. Political figures pointed out that the Soviet conditions were exceptionally generous because, since the beginning of the war, the Soviet Union had stated that it had no territorial ambitions towards Finland and only wanted to protect interests vital to its survival. As for the Karelian Isthmus, the reason for a more advanced request than that proposed last autumn is that since February, the Soviet Union has made significant sacrifices in the area to gain control of heavily fortified defensive positions, so the expansion of its demands is a natural result. Secondly, the Soviet Union's peace negotiations with Finland this time prove that the Soviet Union has abandoned the treaty concluded with the so-called "People's Government" on December 1, 193_, and no longer recognizes Kuusinen as the Head of State of Finland. (Haitong Telegram, 12th)

Helsinki – Neutral political figures in Helsinki believe that the establishment of the Soviet-Finnish peace agreement is a defeat for Britain by the Soviet Union, and Finland is a sacrifice for Britain. Before the agreement is passed by parliament, it has not yet been made public. The general population hopes that the Soviet Union will not insist on the cession of Viipuri, firstly because the city is Finland's second-largest city, and secondly because Finnish troops are still continuing to resist in the center of the city. Military figures are disappointed with the delegation's hasty signing of the agreement. According to government sources, Norway and Denmark put pressure on Finland, hoping it would sign the agreement to prevent the war in Northern Europe from escalating due to British and French intervention. It is believed that if Britain and France provide Finland with substantial assistance, Germany will help the Soviet Union in the war, and then Scandinavia will be drawn into the war. (Haitong Telegram, 13th)

Helsinki – People in Helsinki believe that after the signing of the Soviet-Finnish peace agreement, Finland has lost the Karelian Isthmus and leased the Hanko Peninsula, and as a result, Finland's sovereignty has been greatly restricted. Therefore, the future of Finland is expected to be extremely bleak. Since the start of the war on the morning of November 30, 1939, it has lasted 104 days. Finnish casualties are over 50,000, and the material destruction and financial losses are even more difficult to recover, making Finland's position today inferior to that of the Baltic countries. (Haitong Telegram, 13th)

### Berlin Excited, Rome Welcomes

Amsterdam – According to Reuters, Berlin officials expressed excitement about the Soviet-Finnish agreement, as if Germany was celebrating its own victory. The "Rotterdamsch Nieuwsblad" correspondent in Berlin believes that in addition to the material benefits that Germany hopes to gain from the Soviet Union no longer being at war, the Soviet-Finnish compromise will further increase the Nazi government's authority and prestige at home. (Reuters, 13th)

Berlin – People here are very welcoming of the news of the conclusion of a peace agreement between the Soviet Union and Finland, pointing out that Britain and France have repeatedly attempted to expand the European war to Scandinavia. Therefore, even at the last moment, the British and French leaders issued statements of assistance to Finland in the past two days, intending to induce Finland to continue its resistance. This attempt has been completely thwarted by the signing of the Soviet-Finnish peace agreement last night. Political figures in Berlin pointed out that since the start of Soviet-Finnish negotiations, the British newspapers have said that if the Soviet-Finnish negotiations are successful, it will be a major blow to Britain and France. This remark shows self-awareness, and Germany deeply agrees. (Haitong Telegram, 13th)

Rome – After the establishment of a peace agreement between Finland and the Soviet Union, people here generally expressed welcome, because from the perspective of Italy's position, it really does not want to see the war between Finland and the Soviet Union expand to the Scandinavian countries. (Havas, 13th)

### Major Blow to the Prestige of Britain and France; The Moral Loss of the Allied Powers is Greater Than the Material Loss

London – According to political observers here today, the conclusion of the Soviet-Finnish war is a major blow to the prestige of Britain and France. At the very least, the Nordic countries will now fall into the sphere of influence of the Soviet Union and Germany. At the same time, it will further weaken the position of Turkey and Romania. Finally, this move will greatly benefit Germany's wartime economy. (United Press, 13th)

Paris – "L'Ordre" published an article today commenting on the Soviet-Finnish peace agreement, saying that the result of the agreement is that Finland is under the influence of the Soviet Union, as it was from 1808 to 1919. Can we have any illusions about the durability of this? The moral loss of the Allied powers is greater than the material loss. Another small country in Europe will now be gone. The power of those who advocate national freedom will be affected by this. The trust that they want neutral countries to have will now be reduced. (Reuters, 13th)

### American Public Opinion Expresses Disappointment

Washington – Congressional figures here today unanimously expressed disappointment with the terms of the Soviet-Finnish peace agreement. Democratic Senator Burke said, "These terms cannot be called a treaty, but only extortion." Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Republican Senator Vandenberg declined to comment, believing that it is necessary to conduct a detailed study of the peace treaty. Democrat Clark said that the Soviet-Finnish peace agreement is a matter for the Soviet Union and Finland and has nothing to do with us. Senator Norris believes that this is "a victory for Hitler, a defeat for Finland, a victory for dictatorships, and a defeat for democracy." Democrat Hittler said that all friends of Finland hope that Finland can effectively maintain its independence, but in fact, Finland's sacrifices can be said to be astonishing. (United Press, 12th)

### Finnish Newspapers Published Conditions, All Surrounded by Black Borders

### Severe Disaster in Hebei Province

Beiping – According to news from central Hebei, the famine in Hebei Province has become a reality, and the people have now reached the point of starvation. It is heard that some people are eating tree bark, and some are even eating soil to fill their hunger, resulting in many deaths. There is no food available, and many farmers are pulling up wheat stalks to eat, so there is no hope for the spring harvest. The situation is particularly bad in the Baoding area. It has now been ascertained that the entire area between Baoding and Tianjin is desolate. Last year's floods have not receded to this day, and residents have no food to store. Before September of this year, they will have to find a way to escape the famine. However, the food stored elsewhere has either been taken by the guerrillas or confiscated by the Japanese army, so there is a severe shortage of food among the people, and the situation is becoming increasingly serious. It is estimated that there are about 3 million famine victims in Hebei Province who are crying out for food after last year's floods, and there are also 1 million in Shandong Province. The number of devastated rural areas is about 12,500 in Hebei Province and about 5,000 in Shandong Province. This situation will become increasingly difficult to deal with in the future, and it is feared that it will be unimaginable by spring, as food becomes scarcer and the number of victims increases. Even in Beiping alone, the poor have now reduced their daily meals from three to one. (Reuters, 13th)

### The Premier's Great Contributions: Soviet Newspapers Unanimously Praise Him; His Testament Has Become the Banner of the War of Liberation; Striving to Lead China onto the Path of Victory

Moscow – On the 15th anniversary of the passing of the Chinese leader, Dr. Sun Yat-sen, Soviet newspapers unanimously published articles detailing Dr. Sun's contributions to China. Pravda stated, "The great Chinese figure, Dr. Sun Yat-sen, dedicated his life to the struggle for the liberation of the Chinese nation, breaking the feudalistic shackles imposed on the Chinese people by imperialism. In 1925-27, the reactionary petty bourgeoisie of China violated Dr. Sun's testament and deviated from his path of struggle. As a result, China's national crisis deepened and faced the threat of Japanese imperialism.

This lesson has united honest and patriotic elements in China, forming a solid united front against Japan. The Chinese political parties, the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, have joined hands to advance together, aiming to realize Dr. Sun's Three Principles of the People. Dr. Sun's testament has now become the banner for the Chinese people's great war of liberation against Japanese imperialism, and also the standard for the Chinese people's efforts in construction.

Under this banner, the Chinese people have fought against the Japanese invaders for two and a half years. This struggle has led China onto the path of final victory, completely freeing itself from the shackles of imperialism.

Shameless traitors attempt to lead the Chinese people to violate Dr. Sun Yat-sen's testament. These despicable collaborators shamelessly invoke Dr. Sun's name, attempting to deceive the people in order to achieve their shameless goals. The greatest enemies of China, the greatest enemies of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, will surely be defeated by the entire Chinese people and Dr. Sun's loyal comrades. The great Dr. Sun Yat-sen belongs to the Chinese people, and China will always be loyal to Dr. Sun's testament and strive to realize it." (TASS dispatch, 12th)

Washington – Yesterday, the United States House of Representatives passed the unprecedented Vinson Naval Expansion Act, totaling $966,772,878. Chairman of the House Naval Affairs Committee and drafter of the Vinson Naval Expansion Act, Vinson, stated during the debate on the naval expansion bill, "We want to make it clear to the European countries that our country can use force when necessary. This is the cheapest price to guarantee our country's peace and security. Our primary duty is to have a navy sufficient to protect the United States." Republican Congressman Fish opposed the bill, stating, "Our current navy already makes our country very safe." The naval expansion bill stipulates the construction of 12 new warships, including 2 super battleships of 45,000 tons, 352 new naval aircraft, and $22,553,250 for naval aircraft and munitions. The bill also designates funds to maintain a strength of 150,000 naval officers and sailors and 25,000 Marines. The bill is $111,699,699 less than what President Roosevelt proposed, a reduction of approximately 10 percent. The Navy Department indicated that it would submit a supplementary bill of $100,000,000 before the end of the year to restore the original proposal. The Navy Department also stated that regardless of whether Congress appropriates funds, the department will proceed with the Guam development plan, which requires $4,000,000. The Navy Department has placed Guam under the jurisdiction of the 14th Naval District, using part of the Hawaiian Naval District's budget to develop Guam. The Navy Department does not intend to withdraw the U.S. fleet from the Pacific to the Atlantic or the western coast of the United States. (United Press dispatch, 13th)

### British Under-Secretary Declares That He Deeply Feels the Importance of Aiding China; Will Do His Best to Fulfill the Obligations of the Alliance; Loans to China Appear to Be Under Negotiation

London – During today's House of Commons session, a member asked whether it was true that a credit line of £3,000,000 had been lent to China by Britain last summer and had not been fully used, and whether there were other ways to help China. Under-Secretary Butler replied that the British government fully realized the importance of helping China. As for the availability of the £3,000,000 credit line, he believed there was no doubt.

Another member asked whether he had noted that the U.S. Export-Import Bank had recently decided to provide a loan of $20,000,000 to China.

### British and French Prime Ministers Report on the Progress of Aid to Finland; French Chamber of Deputies Postpones Discussion

London – This afternoon, Prime Minister Chamberlain presented the Finnish situation in the House of Commons. Soviet Ambassador Maisky also listened in the diplomatic gallery. The Prime Minister declared that the Finnish Foreign Minister had informed the British Minister to Finland this morning that the terms of the Soviet-Finnish peace treaty had been signed in Moscow last night, and that the Finnish and Soviet armies had ceased fire at 11:00 a.m. today (Finnish time). Throughout the Soviet-Finnish war, the British government had, together with the French government, supplied Finland with a large amount of war materials and various military supplies (applause). The British government had indeed expressed its willingness to provide the Finnish people with all possible assistance to resist aggression heroically (great applause). I told the House on Monday that we were prepared to provide Finland with all the resources at our disposal, once we knew that this action was in accordance with the wishes of the Finnish government. As for deciding on the course of action most beneficial to Finland in light of all the facts, this should be done by the Finnish government. This is what we should understand. Whatever the Finnish government decides, the British people wish to unite to express sympathy for their situation and admiration for their perseverance and bravery in fighting against overwhelming odds. This can be a consolation to the Finnish people. These heroic facts will be forever remembered in Finnish history and will long remain in the minds of all nations. After the Prime Minister finished his speech, opposition leader Attlee rose and said, "We all admire Finland's struggle. We are relieved that the slaughter has ended, but we cannot help but regret the victory of the aggressor (great applause). Britain should now provide Finland with all possible assistance to help it recover from the wounds caused by this unprovoked attack." (Reuters dispatch, 13th)

London – Conservative Member of Parliament Macmillan requested that the House of Commons hold a secret session to discuss the government's handling of the Finnish issue in recent months. Chamberlain refused. (Havas dispatch, 13th)

Paris – During the afternoon session of the Chamber of Deputies today, Premier Daladier delivered a speech requesting a postponement of the discussion on the Finnish issue. He said, "Since the outbreak of hostilities between Finland and the Soviet Union, France has continuously assisted Finland without interruption. It ranks first among the countries that have provided Finland with military equipment. Detailed figures have been published. Recently, at Finland's request, we provided the country with the latest type of bomber." Our Minister to Finland transmitted a telegram from Finnish Foreign Minister Tanner, expressing gratitude for our country's decision to provide unconditional assistance to Finland. This is clear evidence. "However, merely providing military equipment is not enough to save Finland from its crisis. Therefore, the Supreme National Defense Council decided on the 3rd of last month to send troops to assist in the war. By the 26th of last month, our expeditionary force had been fully equipped and was ready to move out at any time, with many ships waiting in the major ports along the Atlantic Ocean and the English Channel. At the same time, the British government made similar efforts, constantly negotiating with neutral friendly countries diplomatically to ensure that these troops could reach Finland smoothly. However, this assistance could not be provided unless Finland requested it, and up to this point, Finland has not directly and publicly requested it from Britain and France. The reason why we must wait for that country to make a request is that Sweden and Norway have consistently opposed British and French troops passing through their countries. We want to respect international law even during wartime, as can be seen in this example (applause from the members). In short, although our country is prepared to send 50,000 troops to Finland to assist in the war, this must be with the consent of the countries responsible for transportation. There is no doubt. I sent a letter to Finnish Minister Holma on the 7th of this month, in which the key points were, 'Our country has been waiting for your country's call for help for many days,' and informed him of Sweden's pressure on that country. Although we have heard about it, we would still like to reiterate that France is prepared to assist Finland immediately. Our expeditionary force is already fully equipped and ready to go." He also stated that Finnish Foreign Minister Tanner had promised to give our country a concrete reply as soon as the Finnish Parliament held a meeting today. Therefore, I propose that the Chamber of Deputies should postpone the discussion of the Finnish issue." After the Premier finished his speech, the Chamber of Deputies decided to adopt the Premier's opinion and postpone the discussion of this issue until the 19th of this month. (Havas dispatch, 13th)

### Stanley Reports in the House of Commons That the British Army Is Being Organized; The Security and Integrity of Britain and France Are Intrinsically Linked; Equipped on a Continental Scale, It Is Extremely Appropriate

London – When Secretary of State for War Stanley presented the army budget in the House of Commons today, he said that it would be neither appropriate nor desirable for him to predict, as his predecessors had done in peacetime, what kind of tasks the British army would perform in the future. Whatever tasks the army may be asked to perform in the future, the army has not yet undergone the same trials as the navy and air force. Stanley looked back at the views on the continental army, which had previously met with fierce opposition in the country, and then said that the nature of the Munich Agreement seemed to indicate that although war was not absolutely inevitable, it was approaching, and that if war did come, its nature would be what it would be. It is obvious that if war breaks out, Britain must fight side by side with France for freedom and justice, so the security of France is linked to the security and integrity of Britain. If so, then Britain's security will depend on France's security. Therefore, Britain's manpower and great industrial strength must be used to organize an army on a scale sufficient to guarantee our security and worthy of being in the position of a major power. Stanley continued to mention the decision made last year to equip the army on a continental scale, and the British expeditionary force is now in France. No one has heard that this decision was inappropriate. Initially, the military strength was not strong, but now it is rapidly becoming stronger. A large army is currently being organized. We can now assume a larger part of all the war burdens of France, and France initially bears a heavier burden. We must know that although the general decision on British rearmament began in 1936, the army, equipped with all kinds of new weapons and ammunition necessary for modern warfare, only existed one year ago, according to the previous scale. The British army in France is continuing to expand. The number of British troops in France today is about twice as many as in October, and the number continues to increase every day. He had recently visited France, and at that time the British army had gained six or seven weeks of experience in the ice and snow. He inspected along the British army's defensive line and was surprised by the reality that the British army had become and would present. After he returned home, the weather turned better. He knew that in recent weeks, the British army's positions had become increasingly fortified. When he inspected the troops, he saw an atmosphere of practical work and confidence in victory throughout the army, and the relationship between Britain and France was closer in this war than it had been in the last war. In the last war, Britain and France were allies, but in this war, Britain and France are close friends. The British Dominions and India and the colonies have successively given Britain very valuable assistance, for which the people of the country are deeply grateful. The Canadian army has been training in Britain for nearly three months and is gradually completing its training. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)

London – The House of Commons met this afternoon to discuss the army budget for the next year and immediately passed it unanimously.

### Simon's Speech: Peace Must Include the Restoration of Freedom to Czechoslovakia and Poland

London – Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon delivered a speech at a luncheon at the National Liberal Club today, advising the people of the country not to waste energy discussing detailed peace plans and new systems for the international community before the main foundations necessary for a new Europe had been laid. For if the power of the Nazis is not effectively restrained, the free people of Europe will have no future to speak of. Peace must include the restoration of freedom to the people of Czechoslovakia and Poland, but the most difficult and most important condition is that it must be guaranteed that there will be no more Nazi aggression in the future. Verbal recognition of this will be difficult to believe, because Hitler has repeatedly broken his word in the past. This situation has made even the most moderate among us believe that as long as Hitler and his confidants hold power, any valuable solution will be difficult to achieve. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)

It is claimed that the results of Soviet diplomacy in the past two years are threefold: (1) preventing the spread of the imperialist war to the Soviet Union; (2) ensuring the security of the Baltic coastal states; (3) ensuring peace in Southeastern Europe. The conclusion of the Soviet-German Non-Aggression Pact has destroyed the hope of the enemy imperialist powers to turn Germany against the Soviet Union.

### Speculating on the Price of Essential Goods: Authorities to Prosecute According to Law; Municipal Chamber of Commerce Ordered to Find Ways to Suppress Prices; Stabilization Committee to Formulate Specific Measures; Rumor that Two Concessions May Negotiate Cooperation Methods with the Japanese

Yesterday (the 13th), the Public Works Department issued a notice stating: "Notice is hereby given: Recently, certain individuals within the Public Concession have been hoarding, monopolizing, speculating, and profiting from food and other essential goods, causing the current selling price of some of these items to be very high, which hinders the maintenance of public order and good governance in the Shanghai Public Concession. Therefore, it is hereby announced that anyone who commits the aforementioned acts will be prosecuted according to law. This notice is hereby given."

Chamber of Commerce Ordered to Suppress Speculation
In view of the soaring prices affecting people's livelihoods, the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, in addition to issuing orders to various guilds to find ways to suppress and crack down on speculation and hoarding of goods, has reportedly received an order from the Shanghai Special Municipal Party Department to find ways to suppress the prices of daily necessities for the people in order to maintain people's livelihoods. As for the staff of various trade guilds, such as secretaries, clerks, accountants, general affairs officers, and other staff, who are also salary earners, their lives are inevitably difficult at this time of high prices. Therefore, the responsible personnel of various industries are advised to provide appropriate subsidies within their means to provide relief and stabilize their livelihoods.

Working Methods of the French Concession Stabilization Committee
The Rice, Coal, and Retail Market Investigation Subcommittees established by the French Concession Public Works Bureau Price Stabilization Committee have been working actively since their establishment and have achieved considerable success. According to a committee member, the work of the three subcommittees involves listening to information from the French Police Department and various parties, and conducting thorough investigations into the industries under the jurisdiction of each subcommittee. Currently, this work has come to a preliminary conclusion. According to the results of the investigation, we are gradually able to understand the inside story of this price increase. We will formulate specific measures and submit them to the authorities to suppress prices, etc.

The Subcommittee held a meeting yesterday to report on the findings of each group's investigation, in order to discuss how to prepare a report on specific measures to suppress prices and future directions for investigation work. The meeting was held after 5:00 PM yesterday at the French Public Works Bureau. In addition to the foreign members of the subcommittee, Chinese members Yao Zhongba, Jin Zhixuan, Lu Gaoyi, and Wan Modong also participated.

Foreigners Express Opinions
According to foreign sources, the Price Stabilization Committees of the Public Concession and the French Concession may begin negotiations with the Japanese in the near future to request full cooperation from the Japanese side. It is observed that prices in this city will be difficult to fall unless various restrictions and taxes imposed by the Japanese are removed. Taking rice as an example, the efforts of the Stabilization Committee to restrict hoarding and speculation in the concession area may be effective in lowering the price of rice. However, if the Japanese do not allow the inland rice to come to Shanghai, its price will still be unable to continue to fall due to the insufficient supply. Therefore, according to foreign critics, the fact that the Price Stabilization Committees of the two concessions can see this point and implement direct negotiations with the Japanese can be called a "fundamental solution."

### American Judge Returned to Shanghai Yesterday Morning; Enjoyed His Trip to the Mainland; Heard Cases in Guangzhou

According to the English-language "China Press", American Judge Helmick of the U.S. Court for China returned to Shanghai on the French mail ship "Xiafei" on the 13th after visiting Chongqing. He was accompanied by his wife and Collin, the clerk of the U.S. Court. According to Judge Helmick, his trip to China's wartime capital was not an "official mission" but was purely for his vacation and to take the opportunity to travel to the mainland with U.S. Ambassador Johnson and others. He enjoyed the trip very much and visited unfamiliar places, seeing and hearing a lot. After arriving in Hanoi, he traveled by car to Kunming, and then followed the newly opened road to Chongqing. This journey took about five and a half days, without any danger or accidents along the way. He only stayed in Chongqing for a few days. On the way back to Shanghai, he temporarily opened a court in Guangzhou to hear cases involving American citizens.

### The Public Works Department's Surtax Case; Strong Opposition from All Parties; Taxpayers' Association Will Make a More Solemn Representation; Hoping the Bureau Will Tighten its Belt and Abandon the Surtax

Since the Public Works Department of the Public Concession announced its intention to increase the general municipal surtax, special house surtax, and land surtax surcharge by 50% again from July 1 this year, Chinese and foreign taxpayers have taken a clear stance of opposition, believing that it is impossible to increase the burden again during this extraordinary period of soaring prices. The Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the Public Concession has already sent a letter to the Public Works Department at the joint request of the Federation of Citizens of the First Special District and the Citizens' Sub-Associations of various districts, asking them to consider the situation and stop before it is too late. It is learned that the association is closely watching the development of this surtax case and will make a more solemn and firm representation through the Taxpayers' Representative Conference. Currently, all parties in the concession, both Chinese and foreign, hope that the Public Works Department can consider austerity, tighten expenses as much as possible, and abandon the proposed surcharge, so that the outwardly prosperous market can overcome the difficulties.

### Bureau's Explanation of Staff Salaries

A director of the Public Works Department once proposed to the Bureau that in the future, the salaries and retirement allowances paid to the Bureau's employees should be paid in national currency. The Board of Directors of the Bureau has agreed to the above proposal, except for special positions that cannot be hired without paying foreign currency. This very special situation will be considered by the Personnel Committee. Some people outside have misunderstood this matter, and a statement is hereby made to eliminate it. It has been pointed out by the outside world that the Bureau pays its employees in gold pounds, but this is not true. Only one of the Bureau's foreign employees receives a salary in foreign currency, and the rest are paid in national currency. The basic salaries of these employees were converted into national currency when the exchange rate was one shilling, one pence and seven-eighths in 1937. Since then, due to the high cost of living, some allowances have been given to compensate. For Grade A employees (there are actually 163 employees in this category with varying levels in each department, not the very small number that the outside world claims), when the exchange rate fell to six pence, an allowance of 73.24% of their basic salary was added. After that, the exchange rate continued to fall, but the Bureau did not add any allowances. As for Grade B and L employees, a cost-of-living allowance of 40% of their salaries was added. All of the aforementioned temporary allowances were determined by an independent subcommittee after research. The members of the subcommittee were all businessmen of different nationalities, and the report was approved by the annual meeting of the Taxpayers' Association. In addition, the Bureau deducted 5% of their salaries and paid another 10% as savings. Due to the decline in the exchange rate, the value of this savings has also been reduced. According to the recent instructions, the reduction in losses will be borne by the employees by 57% and by the Bureau by 43%. Furthermore, the basic salaries of these employees were previously converted into national currency at the rate of one shilling, two pence and seven-eighths. Later, the exchange rate plummeted, and the Bureau, out of consideration, had guaranteed the exchange rate at one shilling when employees completed their term and withdrew their savings, starting in 1928. As for American and Japanese employees, they were also paid at the same exchange rate, but it was later stipulated that this guaranteed exchange rate would be reduced to eight pence. The majority of the outside world criticizes the Bureau's total expenditure, most of which is used for the salaries of Chinese and foreign employees, but this is also not true. The Bureau's total expenditure on salaries accounts for about 48%, and the Police Department accounts for about half of 48%. This expenditure on police expenses can be called huge compared with other places. At present, the Bureau has a total of 1,348 foreign employees, excluding the Russian detachment of the Volunteer Corps. Their distribution is as follows: (1) Volunteer Corps (excluding the Russian detachment) 10 people, (2) Fire Brigade 40 people, (3) Police Department 858 people, (4) Public Works Department 89 people, (5) Health Department 129 people, (6) Education Department 82 people, (7) Finance Department 15 people, (8) Tax Collection Section 43 people, (9) General Office 22 people, (10) Industrial Section 4 people, (11) Legal Department 2 people, (12) Library 1 person, (13) Chinese Department 4 people, (14) Music Band 48 people. From this point of view, those who want to criticize the Bureau should first consider the above numbers, and if the security provided by foreign employees is greatly reduced, the impact will be not insignificant, and should be noted as well.

### Rotation of Low-Priced Rice Shops; Temporarily Suspended for Five Days Starting Today; Continued from the 19th of This Month; Foreign Rice Arriving in Shanghai Has Exceeded One Million Piculs

The sale of low-priced Saigon broken rice in this city will be temporarily suspended for five days starting today. The Shanghai Low-Priced Rice Committee issued its fourth notice yesterday, stating, "The second phase of low-priced rice sales is scheduled for 20 days, starting on February 23 and ending on March 13. From the 14th, rice sales will be suspended for five days to change the location of the low-priced rice distribution points and handle the handover. The second phase will resume on March 19. This notice is hereby given." The Public Works Department Police also issued a notice yesterday stating, "The Shanghai Low-Priced Rice Committee has chosen to suspend low-priced rice sales from March 14 to March 18, 1940, due to the selection of low-priced rice shops. The address of the new low-priced distribution point (ticket sales and rice distribution address) will be announced separately. In addition to posting the above two notices, each low-priced rice shop will also post a notice stating 'Low-priced rice has not arrived, tickets will be sold when rice arrives.'" According to a member of the Rice Shop Guild, in addition to the 30,000 bags of tribute rice sold in the first phase, more than 20,000 bags of the 40,000 bags of tribute rice scheduled for the second phase have been sold as of March 13, and the remaining amount can be sold out before April 7. The second phase of low-priced rice work is currently being actively prepared.

Although Gold Prices Rise, the Rice Market Remains Stable
Also, after the opening of the rice shop and tea house markets yesterday, rice prices tended to fall due to the sale of hoarding households. However, due to the sharp rise in gold prices, there was no major decline. According to reliable sources in the rice industry, since the beginning of the lunar new year, the total amount of foreign rice ordered by rice merchants that has arrived in Shanghai has exceeded one million piculs, and as foreign rice continues to arrive in Shanghai, rice warehouses are already unable to accommodate it.

Large Quantities of Foreign Rice to Arrive Today
The arrival of foreign rice is reported in this newspaper repeatedly. Yesterday and the day before yesterday, another 18,000 bags arrived. The Taikoo Company's Taiyuan Wheel brought 4,347 bags from Haiphong and 5,310 bags from Hong Kong. It arrived in Shanghai at noon the day before yesterday (the 11th) and has been unloaded. Yesterday morning, the company's Qingyuan Wheel arrived in port, also bringing 8,911 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong, and docked at the company's wharf in the French Concession for unloading. It is reported that a French wheel will arrive in Shanghai today, with a large quantity of foreign rice directly shipped from Saigon.

### Tramcars to Operate in the North District of Suzhou Creek; Negotiations Progressing Well

Since the Suzhou Creek North District tram service agreement was signed by Director-General Ke Lin and Japanese Consul-General Miura at the Japanese Consulate on Seymour Road, rumors have been spreading that the tram service will resume soon. These rumors are rampant, but authoritative sources have not confirmed them. According to sources from the tram company, negotiations to restore tram service north of Suzhou Creek have made good progress. Mr. Ivan, the general manager of the tram company, has hinted that the tram service may be restored in the near future, or within the next week. The negotiations are being conducted directly between the Shanghai Tramway Company and the Japanese authorities, with the British consulates acting as intermediaries. The exact date of operation has not been announced.

### USS Guam to Arrive in Shanghai Tomorrow

According to the Continental News, the USS Guam, a gunboat of the U.S. Yangtze River Fleet, is expected to arrive in Shanghai on the 15th from Wuhu. The USS Luzon is scheduled to leave Shanghai for Wuhu on the 18th. In addition, it is reported that the U.S. cruisers USS Augusta and USS Marblehead will come to Shanghai next month and then sail to Qingdao and Yantai. It is expected that Rear Admiral Glassford, commander of the U.S. Yangtze River Fleet, will remain in Shanghai.

New Subsidiary Coins Have Not Been Shipped to Shanghai; Rumors of Large Shipments Being Delivered Are Inaccurate; However, They Can Still Be Used If They Enter Circulation

In view of the fact that subsidiary coins are the medium for small transactions and are in great demand by the people, the Ministry of Finance has revised the Subsidiary Coin Regulations in order to maintain the circulation of subsidiary coins and eliminate the illegal profits sought by unscrupulous people. The Ministry has ordered the Central Mint to mint new one-cent, two-cent, five-cent, and ten-cent subsidiary coins, which have been minted and will be issued and circulated by the Central Bank. The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce has also been ordered by the Ministry to inform all trade associations and merchants. It is reported that the new subsidiary coins will be issued in the mainland first, and will not be shipped to Shanghai for the time being. However, those that enter Shanghai in circulation can still be used. The number of ten-cent and five-cent coins that can be accepted is limited to 20 yuan in legal tender each time, and the number of two-cent and one-cent coins that can be accepted is limited to 5 yuan in legal tender each time. However, this restriction does not apply to the receipt of taxes and the exchange of currency by the Central Bank. The rumor that a large number of coins have been shipped to Shanghai is inaccurate. It is reported that the design is slightly the same as the previous one, but the model is smaller.

Subsidiary Coin Photos; The Investigation Is A Fake Product
The other day after the subsidiary coins came to Shanghai, a press agency dispatched so called 'Subsidiary Coins' and dispatched the photos to different presses. At that time, this newspaper was thoroughly examining the photos and one side said 'one corner/dime' and there was a picture of an ancient coin. The other side was in English and the words were as such: Loanedror Prizeonlv 1939 and its meaning was for a prize. So it's deduced that this drawing is not the new subsidiary coin because it's a token from a slot machine/coin machine. Because the picture was published by another newspaper, the readers keep asking this newspaper, so record the truth to dispel doubts.

### Japanese Ships Competing for the Yangjiadu Wharf in Pudong Are Blocked; Rowing Gangs Block the Wharf; The Japanese Ferry Company Fails

The ferry business on both sides of the Huangpu River has been controlled by the Japanese Shanghai Ferry Company since the war. The company has expanded its business lines one after another, with a total of eight lines. Yesterday, it tried to open a new ferry line from Yangjiadu in Pudong to the Great Pier in Nanshi, seizing the livelihood of the original private ferries. The boatmen resisted for their livelihood, and the Japanese ferry's attempt to launch its first maiden voyage was blocked. The details are recorded as follows:

Pre-War Ferries Were Seized
Before the war, the Shanghai Olympic Trust Company's Huangpu River ferries had six large ferries (numbers one to six) and eight small ferries (numbers eleven to eighteen), a total of fourteen ferries. All were seized by the Japanese and, except for one that had its machinery dismantled, the rest fell into the hands of the Japanese Shanghai Ferry Company. The profits made from operating the ferries on the other side of the Huangpu River were even greater than before the war. The so-called "Public Works Bureau" had asked the Japanese to hand over the ferries last year based on "city-run reasons", but after many negotiations, they were rejected.

Annual Profit of More Than 700,000 Yuan
At present, the Shanghai Ferry Company operates a total of eight cross-river ferry lines, including (1) Shanghai (Beijing Road Pier) to Gaoqiao, (2) Shanghai to Donggou, (3) Shanghai to Gaomiao, (4) Shanghai to Xidu, (5) Shanghai to Qichangzhan, (6) Shanghai to Nanmatou, (7) Shanghai to Zhoujiadu, (8) Nanshi Nanmatou to Zhoujiadu. The daily profit is about 2,000 yuan in gold, the average monthly profit is 60,000 yuan, and the annual profit is more than 700,000 yuan, which is an astonishing amount.

New Ferry Line; Competing for Private Ferries
In order to control the entire ferry industry, the company recently planned to open a new ferry line from Yangjiadu in Pudong to the Great Pier in Nanshi, which was scheduled to have its first trial voyage yesterday. The operating hours were from 7:00 am to 4:30 pm, and the one-way fare was set at 5 cents per passenger. A small ferry, the "Xidu Maru", was sent out to make its maiden voyage from the Great Pier in Nanshi to Yangjiadu to pick up passengers.

Large Numbers of Rowing Boats Block the Wharf
The Yangjiadu Wharf in Pudong was originally designated as a cordon by the Japanese. After it was opened on January 15, there were 50 or 60 rowing boats carrying passengers between the Great Pier in Nanshi. Recently, seeing that the Shanghai Ferry Company had scheduled to open a ferry yesterday, competing for their livelihood, they united dozens of rowing boats yesterday morning, mooring around the Yangjiadu Wharf, tying them together with ropes, blocking the ferry from docking, and preparing more than 100 thugs on the wharf to destroy the ferry. At 7:10 am, the Xidu Maru arrived in Pudong. The boatmen responded to the call, armed with bamboo poles, preparing to use force. The crew of the Xidu Maru, fearing that the hull would be damaged, immediately sped away. As of yesterday afternoon, the ferry had not resumed operation. It is unknown whether it will be able to reopen today.

### Strictly Prevent the Shipment and Reprinting of Substitute Coupons for Subsidiary Coins in Eastern Zhejiang

The chambers of commerce in various parts of eastern Zhejiang have printed and issued substitute coupons in order to facilitate trade and exchange, as the market is extremely short of corner notes and small change. It has been learned that the chambers of commerce have limited the use of these substitute coupons to the counties, fearing that unscrupulous people will inevitably carry them out of the country and reprint them privately in Shanghai, and then transport them to Ningbo to use them in an attempt to pass them off as real. They have sent a letter to the Customs Superintendent of the Zhejiang Customs, ordering their subordinates to pay attention and strictly prohibit the smuggling of these circulating coupons out of the country, and to strictly prevent counterfeit coupons from entering the country, in order to prevent financial disruption.

### No Results Yet in Negotiations on the Details of the "Police Agreement"; Authorities Say It Is Difficult to Predict When It Will End; Many Outstanding Issues Remain

According to foreign sources, the Public Works Department Police told reporters yesterday that there is currently no possibility of implementing the police agreement on road construction beyond the boundary signed by the Public Works Department and the puppet "Mayor" Chuan Xiaoyan, as no results have yet been achieved on the various details of the agreement. What can be told to you at present is only that the principles are being discussed, but no specific details have been reached. The truth is not allowed to be disclosed, and it is difficult to predict when the negotiations will end. It is said that although the agreement on police matters relating to the construction of roads beyond the boundary was signed by both parties on February 16, many outstanding issues remain to be resolved.

### Post Office Opens Military Yen Drafts for the Japanese Army; Creates a Bad Precedent in the History of Postal Money Orders; Original Tickets Are Sealed and Mailed, Similar to Insurance Letters; The Outside World Has Criticisms of the Post Office's Measures

The Shanghai Postal Administration's acquiescence to the Japanese demand that the public be allowed to use Japanese military yen to issue drafts to Hankou and Jiujiang has attracted great attention from the outside world. The following is a continuation of the situation:

The outside world criticizes the Shanghai Postal Administration for unilaterally agreeing to the Japanese demand that Japanese military yen be used to issue drafts to Hankou and Jiujiang. Because this matter was not reported to the General Administration for approval, the outside world is criticizing the Shanghai postal authorities for compromising and seeking completeness.

Development in the Suburbs of Shanghai
Although the issuance of the above drafts is still limited to the occupied areas, and the branches in the concession do not follow suit, the suburban post offices in Shanghai such as Henglu in Hongkou, Huajin Road in Nanshi, Laoximen, and Lanidu in Pudong all follow suit.

Designated Amount of Remittance
The locations for exchanging remittances of Japanese military yen are still limited to the post offices in Hankou and Jiujiang. Other occupied areas do not follow suit. According to the Datong News Agency, the amount of military yen that can be remitted is limited to 200 yuan in Hankou and 50 yuan in Jiujiang.

Sealing and Mailing Method
Finally, according to the Datong News Agency, the method of mailing the above Japanese military yen is to seal and mail the original tickets. This method was previously only used for insurance letters, and the remittance following this method is a bad precedent in the history of postal money orders, not only violating postal regulations.

### Gold Prices Reach Record High; Strict Sanctions Being Prepared; Deposits, Mortgages, and Exchanges Are Not Allowed; Conversion of Legal Tender Is Underway

Since the end of the war, financial institutions have concentrated in Shanghai. The government has management measures for gold, and private buying and selling are absolutely prohibited. However, Shanghai's black market for gold reached a new record high yesterday. The morning closing price was 4,982 yuan, and the afternoon closing price was 4,995 yuan, once exceeding the 5,000 yuan mark. The price posted by silver shops has reached 5,005 yuan. The local banks and money houses have stopped accepting gold deposits and mortgages in view of national policies. However, pawnshops and silver shops have not stopped the business of gold deposits, mortgages, and exchanges. Silver and money houses that have complied with the regulations are proceeding with the procedure of exchanging gold deposits for legal tender at the legal price. The authorities are paying close attention to other pawnshops and silver shops that have not complied, and will negotiate strict sanctions to correct the law as soon as the necessary preparations are completed.

### Great Shanghai Gambling Den in the City：Fake Police Raid Gambling,恒安 Gambling Den's Thugs Cause Trouble, Japanese Troops Arrive to Suppress and Round Up Everything, Nanyang Bridge Iron Gate Once Closed

The Great Shanghai Club gambling den, located at the Houjiabangkou of Fuyou Road, near the City God Temple in the city, is grand in scale and exquisitely decorated. Inside, it is equipped with all kinds of gambling tools, such as dice games, big and small tables, and Pai Gow. It also has opium couches and employs young women to entertain and serve attentively. Therefore, residents inside the city generally enjoy frequenting it. Unexpectedly, yesterday afternoon around 4 o'clock, while the gamblers were in high spirits, Wen Zhenya, the head of the fake police substation of the City God Temple, leading dozens of fake police officers, armed, rushed to surround and arrest them. They arrested over sixty gamblers and male and female employees on the spot, tied them up with ropes, and took them to the fake substation for investigation. It was also learned that at around 9 a.m. yesterday, two Japanese suddenly broke into the Heng'an Company gambling den in Heng'an Lane, near Nanyang Bridge on Fangbang Road. The gamblers inside were all frightened and dispersed. At that time, the Japanese fired a shot from a handgun, fortunately without hurting anyone. The gambling den then announced its closure.

Zhang Mengsheng, a former detective with a limp, came forward to open the Heng'an Company fake government gambling den at No. 24, Heng'an Lane, near Nanyang Bridge. Because he relied on strong backing, he had earned a huge sum of tens of thousands of gold since its opening, which aroused the jealousy of others in the same industry. A gangster named Yang Abing also opened the Huasheng gambling den at No. 44 in the same area, intending to compete. Unexpectedly, at 12:30 p.m. yesterday, more than ten armed gangsters suddenly demanded protection money from Yang. The two sides disagreed and

a conflict broke out. At that time, someone shouted that guerrillas were attacking the gambling den, which made the situation even more chaotic. The Nanshi Miura Military Police Headquarters was originally stationed at Nanyang Bridge, and the Qizhou Road detachment was nearby. Upon receiving the news, they immediately telegraphed for a large team of Japanese military police to rush to the scene and surround the two gambling dens. The situation was tense. Because the doors and windows of the gambling dens were closed, the Japanese military police fired five or six shots as a warning before they were able to rush in, arresting a total of more than 140 people, including dealers, lookouts, tea servers, and gamblers. They also seized a Mauser pistol inside the den. At the same time, the French Concession police authorities also ordered

Chinese and French police to implement security and temporarily closed the iron gate to traffic. Yang Kufsky, a French Russian detective who was proficient in Japanese, inquired about the incident. Afterwards, Zhang Mengsheng, the limping man who came forward for the Heng'an gambling den, and the old man Li Xiaobao appeared and, through strong connections, offered a large sum of money to have the arrested members of the den released first, in order to resume gambling immediately.

### Selling Counterfeit Money: Two Criminals Arrested Awaiting Investigation

Lang Guangchun, a Chinese detective of the Lao Zha station, and detective Chen Dianwen, investigated the sale of counterfeit Chinese, Jiaotong, Peasant, and Central banknotes. They arrested Han Yu'an, a Yangzhou native, in front of No. 18, Lafayette Road in the French Concession, and seized counterfeit Jiaotong Bank five-yuan notes worth 200 yuan. After interrogation, they went to No. 18, Lafayette Road in the French Concession and arrested Lu A'gen, a Chongming native, and seized counterfeit Jiaotong Bank five-yuan notes, one counterfeit Chinese Bank five-yuan note, one counterfeit Peasant Bank five-yuan note, and four counterfeit Central Bank one-yuan notes. They were all taken back to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court. The police lawyer, Ru Bao'yi, requested permission to reschedule the hearing because it was still necessary to investigate and crack down on the counterfeiting organization.

### Finance: Thinking of the Soviet-Finnish Armistice and the Western Front War, British-American Exchange Rates Have Shrunk Sharply for Days, Affecting the Shanghai Market, Fortunately, the British Exchange Rate Remains at the Original Price

Yesterday's foreign exchange market conditions were affected by the further sharp drop of eight and a half points in British-American exchange rates overseas.

Exchange rates of Dutch, Luxembourg, and Japanese currencies also shrank, while other exchange rates such as the British exchange rate remained stable. As for the half-large inner market situation, although there is talk of a peaceful resolution between the Soviet and Finnish sides in the European situation, the world observes that the Western Front war has the potential to become fierce. In other words, it is unfavorable for Britain and France. Although the British-American exchange rate has plummeted by a large amount of 1 jiao 6 fen 375 in the past five days, most local speculators still look at the small side. Therefore, there are still quite a few who are adding to the British-American exchange rate. However, HSBC is absorbing when it sees it cheap, but it has not given up on maintaining the price of 4 shillings 1 and 25. Therefore, the market situation still remains hidden. The morning opening continued to report British stability and American tightness, priced at 4 shillings 1 and 25 and 6 yuan 46875.

Hua Bi sold to HSBC this month's British gold for 4 shillings 1 and 40625, and Hong Kong telegrams sold to HSBC spot British gold for 4 shillings 1 and 5625. At that time, spot British gold at 4 shillings 1 and 40625 and American exchange rates at 6 and a half yuan could be settled. HSBC's listing was announced, British was flat and American缩 by 1875, and the silver equalization tax was褐晓, falling by 1 and a half points. After this, Huahang Shanghai sold to a certain firm this month's American exchange rate for 6 and a half yuan. Later, Sassoon suddenly came to buy Dutch April 美滙 for 6 yuan 375. At the same time, speculators also came to buy at higher prices, but supply and demand remained flat, and the situation was very stable. Unexpectedly, after 11:30, rumors suddenly spread in the market that HSBC had given up on maintaining the British gold price of 4 shillings 1 and 25. Therefore, the扒风 started again, and the state suddenly告转紧. A certain Huahang结入 同行 Dongya April 美滙 for 6 yuan 375, and Huashang扒进 a certain firm's April 美滙 for 6 yuan 375 and 3125.

### Under Heavy Absorption, Gold Reaches Unprecedented High Price – $5,052 –

Yesterday, the cash gold market surged, rising rapidly and endlessly, breaking the previous high record of $4,915 on the 16th of last month. It soared past the $5,000 mark, reaching an unprecedented peak of $5,052. However, many holders took profits, leading to some resistance to the price advance. Nevertheless, the market still rose by over $100. The reason for today's surge is rumored to be "the clandestine massive absorption by the pseudo-government's Huaxing Bank, coupled with the tightening of the US dollar exchange rate and purchasing by Hong Kong syndicates." Looking at the day's proceedings, the market opened high at $4,910, up $25 from the previous day due to the tight US dollar exchange rate. Subsequently, a certain gold firm, securities houses, and a certain bank competed to buy, pushing the price up another $70 to $4,980. However, some cash gold firms and jewelers sold, causing the price to fall back by over $10 to $4,968. Then, as the foreign exchange rate weakened again, buying resumed, reaching $4,985 before the midday close. In the afternoon, a certain securities house continued to aggressively buy, and a Hong Kong syndicate also joined in, snapping up over 500 taels, causing the price to soar to a high of $5,052. Afterwards, a certain gold firm took the opportunity to cash in profits, releasing a substantial amount, coupled with selling from currency exchange businesses and individual investors, causing the situation to reverse downwards. By the evening close, the price had retreated to $4,990, but the final price was $4,995, still a sharp increase of $110 from the previous day. The entire day's trading was extremely active, with over 4,000 taels changing hands. Jewelry gold once reached $510, and although it later retreated slightly, the final price was still $10 higher. Gold for customs duties remained unchanged.

Spot Gold Jumps $110

From the morning, each bar (10 taels) saw the US dollar exchange rate reported tight, intensifying market sentiment and creating a buying frenzy. The market opened up $25. A certain bank purchased 20 taels from Yu Hao at $4,910. Shortly after, gold firms and currency exchange businesses scrambled to buy, causing a further increase of $30 in an instant. Gold firms purchased 50 taels from currency exchange businesses at $4,940. Subsequently, because jewelry syndicates and cash gold firms sold aggressively, the price was suppressed by a small amount of $8. Jewelry syndicates sold 50 taels to a certain bank at $4,932. Then, a certain securities house suddenly began to aggressively absorb, while currency exchange businesses and a certain jewelry syndicate also bought, causing another surge of $48. Gold firms purchased 50 taels from banks at $4,980. At that time, a certain currency exchange business switched from buying to selling, and a certain bank also began to sell. Although a certain securities house continued to buy, the market still felt oversupplied, causing a small decline of $12. Currency exchange businesses traded 20 taels amongst themselves at $4,968. Unexpectedly, the foreign exchange rate was suddenly reported tighter, and buying resumed. A certain currency exchange business bought again, and gold firms also released offers to buy, causing a further increase of $17. Gold firms purchased 50 taels from currency exchange businesses at $4,985. Then, a bank sold 10 taels to a gold firm at $4,982, which became the midday closing price.

Later, a certain gold firm continued to sell, coupled with individual investors also competing to take profits, causing the situation to suddenly change and fall back by $62. Currency exchange businesses sold 50 taels to securities houses at $4,990. Afterwards, banks slightly absorbed, pushing the price up again by $5. A certain bank purchased 20 taels from currency exchange businesses at $4,995, which became the evening closing price. As a result, compared to the previous day, the price surged by $110. It has now increased for four consecutive days, for a total increase of $219. The entire day saw fluctuations of $142. The selling price of the cash gold firm's own-brand gold, based on the spot gold price, was several dollars higher. The buying price was $20 lower.

### Food Prices: Foreign Rice Fluctuates Rapidly; Kun Sick's Rice at $50 on the Black Market

The rice market was closed the day before yesterday due to the memorial day for the passing of Sun Yat-sen. Yesterday, the source of domestic rice was 2,250+ bags of both Japonica and Glutinous that were being routed from Hongkou District. Meanwhile, the black market for foreign rice outside of the bourse initially tightened due to a higher volume of transactions. However, the results were rather languid and prices saw no changes, holding at the original listed prices. Rumor has it that Kun Sick Japonica was $50, Green Si Thin at $48, and early Late varieties at $46-$47. Glutinous rice saw increased imports in the last two days and therefore, although general customers have purchased it due to its lower prices, sellers remained flexible and the market was mediocre, with no particular gains or losses.

Foreign rice had been trending steadily downward this week, but yesterday morning, due to restocking by general merchants, it was heard that the price of gold had skyrocketed to $500 and that the exchange rate was tightening. Public sentiment suddenly stiffened, and original merchants and vendors were unwilling to sell easily. Speculative hoarders also refused to release their goods, and some even wanted to take the opportunity to pull prices higher. As a result, the shouting began, and the situation was unusually tense, reversing the previous fatigue and showing an upward trend. Saigon No. 1 opened at $44.50, which, compared to the $43.50 price the afternoon before the holiday, was an increase of $1. Others, such as Huo Wen at $43.50 and Xiao Jiao at $40, were up by 50 cents to a dollar. At the time, it seemed that there was hope for a turnaround. However, the market's foundation had already weakened, and people remained fearful. Moreover, credit was tight, turnover was difficult, and a large batch of futures was still arriving this month. Generally, people viewed this upward trend as merely a small recovery after a large fall, and that the overall situation could not be salvaged by financial fluctuations. Therefore, merchants and speculative hoarders sold in unison to capitalize on the high prices. Buyers had no intention of buying more than necessary for restocking. As a result, chips were suddenly plentiful, there were few inquiries, and market prices could not be maintained, falling back again and again. The midday closing prices were tight at first but then fatigued, resulting in a stalemate, with no significant changes compared to the previous market's prices. Saigon No. 1 was $44, $43.60; Saigon No. 2 was $40, Special $41.20; Huo Jiao Pagoda Brand was $43, $42.50; Mixed Brand was $42.25, $42; Xiao Jiao was $39.60, $39; Tokyo Grain Tip was $39.50, $39; Siam No. 2 was $39.50, Mixed Broken $35.50, $35, Next $34, Semi-polished $21.50, $31.

The influence of the shortened exchange rate in morning wholesales of foreign rice resulted in spot and futures prices rising once or twice over 10 cents. As soon as the market showed signs of a turnaround, both the Fuka and Heyi foreign firms began to release their goods. Fuka released 500 tons of Saigon No. 1 due April 1 at $52.30, and Heyi released 400 tons at only $52. The market immediately declined. Return Saigon No. 2 opened at $48.60 to $49 and Xiao Wen at $48.68 to $49, but the market for recycled futures lacked buyers after foreign merchants sold off their holdings. Current foreign rice prices were level or unchanged since the early price gains, at a value similar to the prior day, but about 7,000-8,000 bags sold.

Yesterday, 8,911 bags of foreign rice arrived in Shanghai, transported by the Taigu Company's Qingyuan vessel from Hong Kong. It arrived in Shanghai at approximately 7:00 AM yesterday morning and docked at the French Concession's own wharf to unload. (Zu)

### Returned Flour Market Trends Upward; Wheat Prices Reach $25 Again

Yesterday's flour market trended upwards. The No. 2 Flour Mill's disk was still in its flat-sale period, and as such saw no fluctuations. However, the limited time is only one week and worries that the flat-sale period ending on the 19th would trigger price increases have already emerged. The market remains focused on the returned-to-port inventory to decorate and pad. Rumor has it that with the abolition of export bans for the Green Artillery, Northern gangs continued to load and sell for $15. Old models with good sales in the interior townships sold for $44.50. It was heard that the margin skyrocketed later in the market, with gains of up to 5-10 cents.

Wheat: The market was also turned upward yesterday due to good gains by a certain factory, and there were also rumors of increased purchasing of exported inventory. Suzhou wheat from the North again reached $25/unit. Bengbu wheat opened at $24.75 and Chang wheat at $24.5, selling at 15-16 truckloads of volume.

### Yarn and Cotton: Buyers Rally, Cotton Yarn Grows More Vigorously; March Futures of Double Horses Traded Over $987.50

The yarn market surged forward and retreated rapidly, and was intensely energetic. This resulted from a tighter exchange rate and a stirred public that increased the buying interest, and this resulted in a more forceful market trend. Actual sales of yarn in South China remained comparatively active; however, the level of procurement has not seen a large increase. As the gold market has risen and the exchange rates become short and high, speculators will certainly pull up inventory to a situation of non-relaxation. In the afternoon, public sentiment was more vigorous and the March 20s Double Horses Futures traded at $987.50.

Yesterday, the market for existing yarn inventories saw aggressive buyer interest in response to high public sentiment in the afternoon before the day. The opening price for March 20s Double Horses futures reached $985, and sellers rushed to capitalize on gains, rapidly weakening the momentum and reducing the price by $1.62. By the end of market, it was heard that the US exchange rates tightened and the buying interest rose again. The price trend rebounded to $969, and the calculated volume of transactions at the end of a half-day totaled 3,765 packages. Existing yarn prices for 20s Double Horse grew by $13 per unit. It was recorded that 30 units of cotton yarn were being shipped to Haiphong, 100 units to Haikou, 75 units to the Guangzhou Bay, and 40 units to Hong Kong. A breakdown of the volume being procured by local gangs follows: Local dealers: 3,410; Hong Kong: 340; Wenzhou: 15; Total: 3,765.

### Cotton Mill Procurement has Begun; Local Dealers Feel Stifled

Trade in existing cotton inventories has again grown lively as the cotton mills are seeing growing procurement of 32s and 60s raw materials by Shenxin and Yufeng plants, and cotton purchases by Xinyu consist of 20s and 32s raw materials. Cotton prices have dropped with Indian cotton being cheaper on the currency exchange, and so the local market is uninspired. Market conditions for existing inventory is still complex as American cotton remains tight, so the existing situation is as follows:

News of Foreign Cotton Prices: Prices on the New York Cotton Bourse were pushed down 5-6 pounds in the morning due to low numbers telegraphed from Liverpool and the low performance of the Indian cotton markets, but saw some recovery in price through local trading and some short covering. End of market prices had risen +11 pounds compared to the prior day with futures rising 4-5 pounds. Indian cotton yesterday also declined 6 Robies, and it is predicted that some will see recovery to +2 Robies in volume. Egyptian Cotton has dropped 10 pounds.

### Securities: Unified Class C Approaches $8; Ye Guang Stocks Rise Before Falling

Yesterday's securities market was showing increasing signs of being unable to withstand the high pressure of a sharp reduction of foreign exchange and skyrocketing gold prices, with a gradual trend toward lower prices. Cracks have been shown in positions taken by bullish speculators, and the dumping by Lianhe Company has been most evident. Public debt has long been of little interest to capital-heavy investors, and as such, there has been no great flood of dumping on the market. The sale of 400,000 RMB of Class C stocks sold by Lianhe was the most significant. The other securities companies all procured through cover buys, but the supply still outpaced demand, and the market gradually fatigued. The 8 RMB-range for Class C stocks has been broken, and all stocks followed the market downtrend. The end of market saw losses of 0.25-0.6 RMB with a total turnover of ~ 1,000,000 RMB. A simple summary follows:

Stock Transactions: 50 shares of Zhonghua Publishing sold at 32 RMB each. The stock market for public companies remains dim, with no pressure from sellers and no changes in prices. Real estate stocks rose from 15.4 to 16.5 RMB on rumors that rentals for properties in Hongkou district would be rising. The trend increased so fast that sellers took to the market to capitalize on their gains, and the market reversed itself to 15.9 RMB on the buy and 16 RMB on the sell side. Rubber stocks have been ignored.

### Mixed Grains: Soybean Market, Oil Presses Account for 3/4

The mixed grain market, which was closed in commemoration of the General Manager, resumed as normal. The soybean market was especially active, with oil presses accounting for 3/4 of all sales, and the rest going to Nanyang hoarders from this street. All parties have heatedly tried to raise prices, with average prices for lower and mid-grade inventory increasing by 1 RMB. Higher grade soybean sales saw marginal gains of 50-60 cents, with a total volume of the following: Bengbu Soybean- Truckload at $25.50; Mulberry Garden Bean – 120 packages at $22.50-$21; Nanjing Bean – 4 truckloads at $25-$23.50, Average at $21; Wuhu Bean – 3 truckloads at $25.50-$24.50; Dingjiazhou Bean – 600+ packages at $26.50-$26; Yangzhou Mountain Bean – 2 truckloads at $23.60-$23; Chongming Shayang – 600+ packages at $25.20-$23; Pinghu Du Bean – 300+ packages at $27-$24; Jiangbei Qing Bean sold 700 packages to factories and hoarders from this street at prices that gradually rose from $20.60 to $21.50.

### Life Guidance for Middle School Students (II)

— Wang Maozu

Third, Methods of Life Guidance The objective of life guidance is to channel the thoughts, emotions, and actions of young people towards national rejuvenation and to strengthen the forces of resistance and nation-building. The guiding principle should be based on the New Life Movement, providing guidance and direction on all aspects of daily life—clothing, food, housing, and transportation—to align with the principles of life—propriety, righteousness, integrity, and sense of shame. However, guidance must have a methodology to achieve twice the result with half the effort. Based on the aforementioned characteristics of adolescence, I will further elaborate as follows: (1) "Suggestion and Inspiration" First, young people are susceptible to suggestion, so the impression teachers give to students must be pure and profound. In addition to leading by example, they must also join student groups, collaborate with them, observe student actions, and provide guidance as needed. The school environment must also be arranged to eliminate all negative stimuli. In regular classes, regardless of the subject taught, it is necessary to constantly highlight the points related to morality and life, expanding their concepts so that they can be applied to all aspects of daily life. For example, cleanliness, speed, accuracy, and the habit of thinking about things can be cultivated in mathematics and natural science. By analogy, the teaching value of each subject is not limited to the practical knowledge of the subject itself, but its function can be aggregated into the cultivation of personality. Second, extracurricular activities are even greater opportunities for life guidance. Students should be allowed to organize themselves and be supervised and assisted by counselors to cultivate students' ability to act automatically and organize. It is essential not to let teachers take the initiative entirely, which would result in mechanical forms. In addition, it is necessary to visit families, report the advantages and disadvantages of each student to parents to encourage them to pay attention. Third, the teaching policy should be based on Sun Yat-sen's teachings and President Chiang Kai-shek's instructions, and should also select pictures, biographies, etc. of giants, great virtues, thinkers, scientists, industrialists, and explorers from Chinese and foreign history for students to emulate. The selection of student reading materials should be able to inspire thought and wisdom, nurture morality and personality, provide correct explanations for modern social problems, and promote students' lofty ideals and noble outlook on life. Guide extracurricular reading. Fourth, young people have weak comprehension but like to debate. Discussion groups on current events should be organized to allow everyone to state their opinions, which are then summarized by the teacher, and questions should be repeatedly asked to discover their naivety and make them aware of their errors to reach correct conclusions. Socrates' method of dialogue and inspiration is very useful. (2) "Transplantation and Sublimation" Ways should be found to channel and release the movements and surplus energy of young people. One method of guidance is substitution or transplantation. Substitution is selecting good stimuli to replace bad stimuli. For example, hand movements, from small to large, can be said to be incessant. Once they stop, they will scribble when they see chalk, play with objects, or create all sorts of mischief. Therefore, hand labor must be intentionally trained. It is best to equip each person with a set of simple tools, or paintings or crafts, for them to practice in their spare time. Transplantation is transferring harmful reactions to beneficial reactions. For example, the aforementioned antagonistic competition can be regulated to cultivate fair competition. To go further, to enable citizens to abandon private fights and courageously engage in public battles is also a kind of transplantation method. Sublimation is the transformation of human desires from lower to higher expressions. For example, the diversion of sexual desires and boredom can be promoted through music, literature, recreation, sports, and various service activities to channel their attention to some task of interest and turn the original desire into a driving force for their careers.

### Scott Cup Final: Lido to Play with Reserves; Injuries Mount, Helpless; Tens of Thousands of Fans Will Be Disappointed

The Scott Cup Football Championship, after Donghua quickly lost it to foreign teams for three years, Lido surprisingly won it back last year, restoring the pride of Chinese teams. This year's Scott Cup competition has attracted as many as fourteen teams, making it a grand event. Lido, as the defending champion, broke through Survey, defeated the British Army, and smoothly reached the final week. They are scheduled to compete against Portuguese Businesses this Saturday for the championship. Lido's only strong rivals in the Scott Cup were Dong Sailai and West Force. Currently, the British Army has been defeated by Lido in the semi-final week, and West Force has been eliminated by Portuguese Businesses. Strong enemies have been eliminated. The Portuguese are not to be feared, but Lido, in order to maintain the spirit of sportsmanship, does not want to compete too fiercely. Furthermore, many players were injured in the match against Dong Sailai. Li Yichen, Zhang Lin'gen, Jiang Zhaoxiang, Meng Yiliang, Huang Kehou, Xu Wenkui, Cao Qiuting, etc., are either ill or injured, making it difficult to field a full team for this Scott Cup final. It is heard that Lido may use the same lineup as last week's match against the French Businesses to compete with the Portuguese Businesses, but this is a last resort. Tens of thousands of fans will be greatly disappointed. The ticket revenue of Western football clubs will also be greatly affected.

### Salt Yard Oversupply

Since the Huai Riverbank has not been fully restored, the sales channels are limited, and the salt yards are accumulating more and more salt over time. After previous inspections, a comprehensive review was conducted on all the fields in Tongtai, summarizing the total amounts as of the end of April this year. Excluding the salt stored in Yizhan, the Tong area, under the inspection, has a total of 138,097 barrels and six fen and one li of pointed salt, 8,936 barrels and six fen and four li of mixed salt, and 243 barrels and eight fen of alkaline salt. Under subsequent receipts, there are a total of 539,105 barrels and six fen and two li of pointed salt, 68,183 barrels and three fen and two li of mixed salt, and 68,650 barrels and six fen and nine li of alkaline salt. In the Tai area, under the inspection, there are a total of 381,565 barrels and three fen and four li of pointed salt, 249,112 barrels and three fen and nine li of mixed salt, and 421 barrels and four li of alkaline salt. Under subsequent receipts, there are a total of 827,015 barrels and four fen and six li and eight hao of pointed salt, 613,572 barrels and seven fen and eight li of mixed salt, and 82,888 barrels and two fen and four li and two hao of alkaline salt. There are also 1,123 barrels and one fen and five li of newly received Pu Lin pointed salt. In total, there are 1,968,835 barrels and nine li of salt in storage. Calculated at three barrels and five fen per yin, this amounts to nearly 900,000 yin. Based on annual coastal sales, it will take nearly three years to transport all the salt. During these three years, new salt will continue to accumulate in the various fields, inevitably increasing year by year. In this situation, the cost is locked up, and the merchants are becoming increasingly distressed, which is unsustainable. It is now heard that the Ministry is considering the restoration of the Huai Riverbank as a priority, and the Governor-General of Liangjiang is also strongly advocating for it. It remains to be seen how the provinces of Sichuan and Hubei will respond and whether there will be any turnaround for the Huai merchants. This matter will be closely watched.

### The Source of Articles

— Huang Jiayin

In my opinion, the sources of articles can be divided into three categories: The first is firsthand experience, personal observation, or the result of one's own reasoning, which belongs to the realm of original creation.

The second is written records of what one has heard, which is not as authentic or profound as the first type. However, if the speaker is reliable and the recorder has a knack for writing, it can still be a good article.

The third is the compilation of materials from various books, newspapers, and magazines, which belongs to the realm of translation and editing. This type of article also requires considerable artistic cultivation and effort and is completely different from plagiarism.

Among the above three types, the first type of writing is the most valuable. However, it is not always possible for every writer and reporter to have firsthand experience before writing an article. Therefore, feature articles in foreign newspapers and magazines often draw from all three sources. The most ideal situation is, of course, a combination of all three sources, which results in the richest content and the most profound descriptions. Even articles with only two sources are already good.

In the future, the criteria for selecting manuscripts for Free Talk will also strictly adhere to the above-mentioned sources of article materials. We hope that the authors of every article, long or short, will provide detailed information about the source of the materials, especially for articles that are translated or edited. The original author, publisher, and publication date must be clearly indicated. Considering that Free Talk belongs to the readers, we hope to provide readers with a guarantee of meaningful and valuable spiritual nourishment.

Manuscripts plagiarized from old newspapers are strongly discouraged from being submitted!

### War: Anti-Gas Campaigns in European Countries

— Qing

The god of war has plunged the hearts of Europeans entirely into the terror of poisonous gas. Newspapers are using eye-catching, startling headlines to report that laboratories are stepping up the production of some novel and potent poisonous gas. In magazines of various countries, such as London's 'Observer' and Paris's "La MATIN," there are texts debating war: Can enemy aircraft's mustard gas bombs suffocate the entire city? Or are they merely advertisements pushed by arms dealers to sell goods? There are also news items such as Parisians busily surveying gas shelters and Londoners discussing the construction of field hospitals for gas protection. Indeed, Europeans are panicked and at a loss under the threat of poisonous gas, finding no way to escape.

In addition to urging people and governments to pay attention to preventing the threat of poisonous gas, the International Red Cross in Geneva has recently published a monthly magazine dedicated to reporting the implementation and results of anti-gas campaigns. Numerous shops in Paris display gas masks in large glass windows. In Rome, many large department stores place a mannequin wearing a strange mask in front of the window, staring outward as if warning that the god of death is about to fall from the sky. In London, the number of gas masks sold is astonishing. Usually, each mask is worth about 15 US dollars, but with the recent increase in production, supply exceeds demand, and the price has dropped to 7 US dollars per mask.

Germany is training the public to fully recognize various poisonous gases. White cross gas is a "tear gas" that can cause people to tear up. In severe cases, it can cause complete vision loss, bleeding, and death. Green cross and blue cross gases are "lung-rotting gases." Under the dissemination of the above three types of poisonous gas, gas masks are only sufficient to protect people's eyes and respiratory systems. There is also a yellow cross or mustard gas that can only be defended against with a full-body rubber suit, as it can penetrate thick woolen uniforms and skin and reach the internal organs. Residents of major German cities have extensive knowledge of the above-mentioned poisonous gases. To familiarize the public, the authorities sell boxes containing glass tubes filled with small amounts of the four types of poisonous gas. Buyers can attach each glass tube to a toy cannon. When the cannon is fired, the poisonous gas inside the glass tube is released, allowing citizens to distinguish the different characteristics of each type of poisonous gas's odor.

Recently, a portable "gas shelter" has become popular in Paris. It is made of metal plates formed into a small pavilion, equipped with oxygen equipment inside. Each shelter can accommodate ten people and costs about 95 US dollars. It can last for up to eight hours when the door is closed. Outside of the city, camps and cellars, such as field hospitals, provide shelter for about 500 citizens in Paris. Italy's Mussolini had already formulated a plan for the safe evacuation of residents in the event of a declaration of war and printed its outline in a booklet for distribution throughout the country.

Regarding the protection of citizens, a certain French general said: "We certainly cannot completely protect all citizens of a large city from the traps of bombs and poisonous gas... but if we can save five and a half out of a thousand people, the efforts we have made can be considered rewarded."

Today, European countries are both stepping up the production of lethal weapons on a large scale and making various anti-gas preparations. The tragic re-enactment of the history of war is only a matter of time.

### The European War and Crime (Part 1) Death Penalty, Death Penalty, Death Penalty - Germany

— Shi Tao

At the same time as the German army attacked Poland, Hitler issued a serious warning to the German people: "While the soldiers on the front lines are staking their lives in battle, any citizen who takes advantage of the war to enrich themselves will be courting death!" German wartime criminal law, wartime economic law, and general wartime regulations all embody this spirit. Therefore, since the war began, the daily life of Germans seems to be approaching the death penalty. For example, last October, a 27-year-old young man took advantage of the darkness of the blackout to steal a purse containing collections placed by a female shop assistant. At that time, the Berlin Special Court sentenced the young man to death, which shocked the entire Germany. The verdict was based on the "Offenders Against National Life" ordinance, the first item of which was "Crimes Utilizing Air Defense Measures," which stipulated the death penalty for those who commit crimes against body, life, or property by taking advantage of the blackout. Therefore, the young man became the first person to be subject to this ordinance.

Although the law was so strict, news of people being executed for violating that law appeared in newspapers almost every week thereafter. On November 27, a 23-year-old man born in Nuremberg tried to steal the money bag of a coffee shop waitress, but unfortunately, his initial attempt failed. Thus, he ended his life on the gallows. The reason for the verdict was: "Every working woman has the right to safely return home on the streets during the blackout. To ensure the safety of the dark streets, even though the defendant is a first-time offender, the death penalty is appropriate."

At the end of last year, a man was finally sentenced to death by the High Court for indecent assault on women in the dark. Arsonists, etc., were punished much more severely than usual. A man named Grafa set fire to his flour mill in order to defraud insurance money, and the wheat stored in the warehouse was reduced to ashes along with it. Later, this man was also sentenced to death, the reason being: "The defendant turned the necessities of German national life during the war into nothingness, damaging Germany's economic ability to resist the war. Therefore, the defendant is an offender against national life and is sentenced to death."

In wartime Germany, the interests of the country must be placed before personal interests. If you break someone else's hand or foot, you will also be sentenced to death, because this damages human resources and reduces Germany's ability to resist the war. In the economic sphere, everyone knows that Germany is now implementing a shopping coupon system, and crimes that violate price control orders are also emerging one after another. For example, at the beginning of the war, the owner of the famous Filsdaan Hotel in Berlin was fined 300,000 marks for violating wartime prices and providing food. Since the news was published in the newspaper, the entire food and beverage industry has not dared to disobey the control. Other incidents of exposing large-scale price transactions are simply too numerous to count.

Since the start of the war, more than a dozen Germans have been executed for leaking state secrets. Therefore, we can imagine that espionage activities in Germany must be quite lively. As for anti-National Socialist political prisoners, they are absolutely not something outsiders can know. Even the bomber who tried to kill Hitler in Munich is still some kind of non-news to this day.

### Clouds of Jimei: Impressions of Zhou Bichu's Oil Landscape Paintings

— Wu Cun

Several years ago, I had already urged Mr. Zhou Bichu, an artist known for his bright landscape paintings, to hold a solo exhibition. Mr. Zhou always modestly said, "Let's wait a little longer." When Mr. Zhou returned with great acclaim after holding an exhibition in Fujian Province at the invitation of the Fujian Provincial Department of Education (during the tenure of Huang Mengkui as Minister of Education in 1932), I urged him again, but he still modestly said, "Let's wait a little longer."

Last autumn, I saw his masterpiece "Clouds of Jimei" in Mr. Zhou's studio. Its brightness, its beauty, its atmosphere, all made me feel that Mr. Zhou's paintings had reached a very high level of achievement. Jimei is the only school village in southern Fujian. I received education there as a child, and the scenery of the village has always been admired. After the war, Xiamen was occupied, and Jimei was constantly bombed. The school village has become a scorched earth, and the beautiful clouds of Jimei have become pervasive war clouds. Therefore, this masterpiece has gained unparalleled value.

Mr. Zhou's landscape works are comparable to those of Mr. Zhou Tingxu, whose name is renowned in the international art world (coincidentally, both Mr. Zhous are from the same hometown). I don't understand painting, but I have a strong interest in painting because the film I work in is related to painting. This time, I was able to see Mr. Zhou's preview and fulfill my wish to urge him to hold a solo exhibition. I am very happy and content, so I scribble down this article.

### The Age of the Earth

— Xu Mengbiao

The Earth existed long before humans, and its age is unknown. Now, some scientists have used various methods to estimate its age. French geologist Gauder believes that the solid crust existed as early as 200 million years ago. Others estimate the history of the Earth to be even longer than 200 million years.

As for the basis for studying this question, some analyze the chemical composition of the Earth's crust; others use the Earth's diameter as a starting point for research; if we observe the movement of the Moon from an astronomical perspective, we can also solve the problem of the Earth's age.

### Citizens of the Kingdom (3)

A person cannot be considered a citizen of the kingdom simply because of their belief. The so-called kingdom is not only a matter of belief but also a code of conduct. That scholar knew his theology, was familiar with all the doctrines of religion, and could fluently recite the laws of Sabbath keeping, the rite of Holy Communion, and the various habits and methods of prayer. He had a systematic belief that he was able to memorize and recite, but Jesus told him that that was not the true essence of religion. Because it is not only a believing heart that makes a person a Christian. A person can have a believing heart like an angel and at the same time behave like a devil. He can know all the religious laws and rituals while lacking pure thoughts and generous compassion. For anyone like this, his religion is only a set of doctrines unrelated to life and is all outside the realm of the kingdom. We want to test a person's beliefs simply by looking at his life. It is possible to believe in a doctrine while remaining unconcerned with personal dignity and social justice. Sincerity is a virtue, but sincerity alone cannot make a person a citizen of the kingdom, because sincerity, without tolerance, reason, and charity, is often the opposite of religion. If a person is sincere, we should respect him, but in fact, his sincerity can never make him free from fault. Jesus was nailed to the cross, and those who did it were undoubtedly sincere in their beliefs, and yet. Jesus prayed for them, because they were sincere, but ignorant. Sincerity without knowledge turns faith into stubborn obstinacy. Because it can only make a person fervent but cannot make a person blameless. Saul of Tarsus, who wanted to kill the Christians of Damascus, was absolutely sincere in his mind, and from that time on, millions of people were killed and became martyrs because of those sincere but misguided accusers. Therefore, we must not only be sincere but also have enlightened minds and charitable hearts. (To be continued)

Silver Screen Anecdotes

### African Black Films: Jingyi, the director and cinematographer are all black. Actors are paid in livestock.

— Jingyi

In Da Kao Nigeria in Africa, there is a black film company. The supervisor of the company is a black man named Nokdto Tuo. He was born in the United States. Film is his only hobby. He went to Hollywood to study film production techniques. After completing his studies, he opened this black film company.

The initial capital of the company was five yuan. The shareholders are all black. Even the directors, photographers and set designers are all black. Black actors do not like surplus money, so the company pays them mostly in livestock such as cattle and sheep. Hiring a leading actor often requires nearly a hundred cattle or more sheep as salary.

After the first film was shot, it caused a sensation. Black films were an unprecedented initiative, so the business was very prosperous. So the company increased its capital and continued to film. But when shooting a film with a night festival ceremony as the background, because the light was too dark, plus the leading actor's dark face, when it was filmed and released, the holes on the silver screen became looming black shadows. So no one watched the film, and the company lost a lot of money. The leading actor also demanded that the company compensate him for his loss of reputation. Since then, this black film company has not dared to shoot films with night scenes again.

### Unofficial Chronicles of the Pear Garden

— Xu Muyun

Remembering Liu Hongsheng's Sudden Death (Part 2)

Unexpectedly, during his last visit to Shanghai, because the owner of the garden praised him so much, he couldn't help but want to sell more energy. One day, his "Perfect Return to Zhao" was scheduled, and he felt that this play, in addition to the "Just Received Orders to Go to Western Qin" section of the Xipi original board, did not have any major singing, which was too easy, so he specially added a cross-dressing performance of Cao Cao in "Yangping Pass" in front. The most difficult part of this play is the big introduction when he comes on stage. Insiders call this the Tiger Head Introduction, which is considered the most difficult among the net roles. As for the singing in the back, it is not very difficult at all. Because Hongsheng wanted to show off his black voice, he had to put in all his energy and spirit to do it. Unexpectedly, after all these years of not singing, the usage of the raw net voice is completely different from that of the gong, and it is very different. When he read it, he inevitably used too much force, and he already felt the blood churning upwards, and he couldn't support it anymore. What's more, he was over fifty years old and had been excessively lustful when he was young, which crippled one of his legs, which was the reason. When the finale "Perfect Return to Zhao" came on stage, he was even more dizzy and dizzy, and he barely sang halfway when he suddenly fell to the ground and vomited blood. After his death, various rumors spread in the opera troupe. Some said that Zhang Yuting had come to take revenge, and some said that Liu's adoptive father, Mr. Li, had come to capture him alive. It turned out that when Zhang Yuting went south from Tianjin that year, he heard on the ship that Hongsheng was also taking a stage on the sea. In the future, the two sides would compete against each other. Yuting thought to himself, his voice could not compete with Liu. What's more, after he vomited blood, his body was weak and had not recovered. This scare caused him to vomit blood and die. As for Hongsheng's adoptive father, Mr. Li, he was originally a wealthy businessman. When Hongsheng contracted a venereal disease and crippled one of his feet, he was so poor that he was about to die. Fortunately, Mr. Li took him to his home, extended medical treatment, and recuperated him, so that he could actually go on stage again. This was considered his great benefactor: Unexpectedly, Liu even fornicated with his wife, and Li died in resentment. After Hongsheng's death, his colleagues announced it for him. Regardless of whether these superstitious things are true or not, I think it is important for all people not to be ungrateful or kick the ladder after crossing the river, and even more so to repay kindness with resentment and even fornicate with the wife and daughter of one's benefactor. That kind of sin is even greater. Luo Xiaobao is indeed worthy of being praised, first of all because of his good personality, which can be said to be worlds apart from Liu.
