### German Forces Launch Full-Scale Offensive, French Army Resists Fiercely Along Bloody Front, Famous Verdun Fortress Falls Yesterday, German Vanguard Units Have Crossed the Argonne Forest

Bordeaux Port - The General Headquarters issued a war bulletin this morning stating, "The intensity of the front-line battles has reached its peak in the past 24 hours. The enemy has deployed fresh troops to the front lines to join the fighting, using various powerful weapons to launch fierce attacks on the heights of Langres. Their vanguard units have crossed the Argonne Forest, reaching the vicinity of Glennes. Although our forces are smaller in number and have inferior armaments, they are still fighting heroically, offering resolute resistance." (Havas News Agency dispatch from the 16th)

Hitler's Headquarters - The German High Command announced yesterday that German forces, after breaking through the Maginot Line on both banks of the Meuse River, have already occupied the Verdun fortress and its urban area. (Haitong News Agency dispatch from the 16th)

Berlin - The German Supreme Command announced that German troops yesterday, after capturing two fortresses on the Maginot Line, had broken through a vast section of the line south of Saarbrücken. The Supreme Command also announced that the city and forts of Verdun were captured by German forces yesterday. It is noted that this area was one of the major bloody battlefields of the last European war. The main defensive forts of Verdun, Fort Douaumont and Fort Vaux, have both been occupied. Authoritative circles solemnly declared, "Germany will not rest until the enemy is completely subdued." Rumors of peace negotiations were also denied. German sources said that the French army is currently putting up fierce resistance on the Maginot Line, using the depth and breadth of the line to transport large quantities of supplies, stockpiling provisions for more than a year of use. (United dispatch from the 16th)

Somewhere in France - According to military sources, the German army's plan to break through the Maginot Line has had little effect. As for the German troops occupying the Paris area, they are launching a new offensive southeast along the Seine River and the upper reaches of the Marne River, aiming to attack the rear of the Maginot Line from the flank. These German troops have crossed the Seine River in the Romilly-sur-Seine area and broken through the town of Saint-Thierry. The vanguard of their motorized units advanced towards the Argonne Forest last night. At the same time, the German army is increasing pressure on the French army across the entire front, forcing the French army to retreat further south after abandoning Paris. In addition, German troops west of Paris, after breaking through the towns of Troyes and Évreux, have advanced to western Normandy, occupying the port of Le Havre and areas south of the Seine River. (Havas News Agency dispatch from the 16th)

Berlin - While the churches here are still ringing their bells to celebrate the occupation of Paris, the German High Command announced the capture of Verdun and the breakthrough of the Maginot Line south of Saarbrücken. People in Berlin were greatly surprised, as in the last World War, the German army began its attack on Verdun on February 21st, lasting half a year, with over a million casualties on both sides, but never conquered Verdun. This time, however, it was announced to be occupied in just [blank] hours, which is truly a miracle. (Haitong dispatch from the 16th)

### German Army War Bulletin

Hitler's Headquarters - This afternoon, the German war bulletin stated that the entire front, from the Swiss border to the English Channel, is under German control. The German army is pursuing its victories with rapid progress, and the number of prisoners increases daily. Southeast of Paris and on the upper reaches of the Marne River, German tanks and mechanized units are advancing south, having crossed the Langres plateau. The fortresses of Verdun and nearby forts are all in German hands. The Longuyon fortress, known for its strength, has also been occupied by German forces. German military aircraft and anti-aircraft guns assisted troops in crossing the upper reaches of the Rhine River. German fighter planes, dive bombers, and destroyers are active throughout the entire front, destroying thirty train cars and burning several trains carrying military supplies. In total, the enemy lost forty aircraft yesterday, eleven of which were shot down in air combat, nine shot down by anti-aircraft guns, and the rest destroyed on the ground. Seven German aircraft are missing. A submarine that recently returned to Germany reported that it sank a troop transport ship with a displacement of 12,000 tons on May 30th. Another submarine reported that it fired a torpedo at a British auxiliary cruiser, inflicting heavy damage or sinking it. The ship's displacement was 14,000 tons. (Haitong dispatch from the 16th)

French Forces Dispersed, Acknowledge Serious Situation

Bordeaux Port - French military officials recently stated that the enemy is increasing pressure on the entire front today, forcing French retreating troops to continue their southward retreat. The French cabinet is holding an emergency meeting here with the heads of the army, navy, and air force. "But it is undeniable that the military situation has become extremely serious. All of our divisions have been deployed to the front lines for combat. Since our forces are dispersed, we cannot deploy heavy troops to each front line, so our defenses are truly lacking in depth. In addition, it is well known to the world that we have no reserve forces to dispatch and that military equipment is urgently needed." As for the military situation on the front lines, the General Headquarters issued a war bulletin tonight, the main points of which are as follows: (1) In the eastern Alsace region, German troops near Neuf-Brisach have crossed the Rhine River but have not yet broken through the French lines. (2) On the western coast, German troops are advancing along the coast towards Le Havre, while those on the south bank of the Seine have crossed the towns of Troyes and Évreux. (3) In the central Paris region, German troops are advancing eastward in pursuit of their victories, crossing the Seine River in the Romilly-sur-Seine area. Another unit has broken through the town of Saint-Thierry, and its vanguard troops have advanced towards the town of Argonne Forest. (Havas News Agency dispatch from the 15th)

Italian Troops Assist German Operations, Penetrate Southern France

Rome - According to the Italian military bulletin, Italian troops are continuing their attack on the French border, penetrating into French territory, repelling several French counterattacks. (Taiwan Public Dispatch from the 16th)

Rome - According to a military bulletin, Italian forces recently bombed military facilities in southern France, dropping many tons of heavy bombs on Le Cannet, north of Cannes, and the town of Sospel, northeast of Turbie. More than forty French aircraft were destroyed, and several ammunition depots were also destroyed. However, five Italian aircraft did not return to base after this air raid. (United Press dispatch from the 16th)

Rome - According to news received here yesterday, Italian troops along the Alpine border advanced towards Nice yesterday. It is reported that French fresh troops have been deployed to the southern front to prepare to resist a large-scale invasion. (United Press dispatch from the 16th)

French Forces Fight Hard to Save the Situation, Hoping for American Assistance Like Watching for Clouds

London - According to special dispatches from here, the question of how long the French army can continue to hold out against a far larger enemy force has become increasingly agonizing in the past 24 hours. It is estimated that 2 million German troops are participating in the battle from the coast to the Meuse River, including several fresh divisions. The French retreat behind Paris has further lengthened their lines. In French Prime Minister Reynaud's appeal to President Roosevelt, he also stated that German aircraft and tanks are superior. Officials have not attempted to conceal the extremely dangerous nature of the war situation. Both the east and west fronts, from the coast to the Meuse River, are now under threat. In the western region, German armored units are followed by large numbers of well-equipped motorized divisions. The urgency of the situation at the eastern end is no less. However, the French army has been able to defend the Montmirail hub, which has a mobile line of [blank] the Maginot Line. In the past 24 to 48 hours, the war may have reached its critical point. French forces have made superhuman efforts [blank], suffering enormous losses, but are still fighting the enemy with their remaining strength. However, if active assistance from other civilized countries cannot arrive quickly, then the future is grim and cannot be concealed. France is now facing one of the most tragic moments in its history, hoping daily to see a cloud the size of a hand appear in the sky over the Atlantic, a sign of French [blank] aircraft arriving. But they must arrive, and they must arrive in the thousands. (Reuters dispatch from the 16th)

### Maginot Line - Construction Cost 10 Billion Francs, Built with Underground Tunnels Leading to the Rear

Copenhagen - Three Danish journalists had the opportunity to visit the Maginot Line. One of them published an article in the Afnavis newspaper yesterday, describing his impressions of the Maginot Line. The article stated that France boasts of having spent 10 billion francs on building the Maginot Line, but this huge sum would have been enough to build a hundred Elizabeth-class battleships. The Maginot Line is designed to prevent attacks, so its construction includes water tanks, food [blank], and car pools, all of which can store enough supplies for several months. If the defending forces in each section of the line are cut off, they will not be captured by the enemy or surrender to the enemy, because there are underground tunnels that can retreat to the rear. Their entrances and exits are extremely secret. (Haitong Ray dispatch from the 16th)

### British Forces Occupy Two Italian Forts on the Libyan Border, Over 100 Italian Soldiers Captured

London - A War Office bulletin stated that British forces, working closely with the Royal Air Force, attacked the Italian forts of Capuzzo and Maddalena near the Egyptian-Libyan border. They have captured the fort of Capuzzo, capturing four Italian officers and one hundred soldiers. The fort of Maddalena has surrendered. The details of the battle are not yet known. In addition, Italian aircraft bombed the border post of Sollum in Egypt, causing minor casualties. (Reuters Military dispatch from the 16th)

Cairo - British aircraft assisted army units in attacking the Italian fort of Capuzzo in the Italian colony of Libya in North Africa, destroying Italian powder magazines and damaging the forts. Army units then attacked, finally capturing the fort. In addition, British aircraft flew to Sidi Azaz [blank] on the 13th of this month, bombing Italian military targets with considerable success, destroying four Italian aircraft and damaging two. (Havas News Agency dispatch from the 16th)

### France Firmly Denies Separate Peace, Maintains Cooperation

Bordeaux - Political figures here are unwilling to comment on the proceedings of today's cabinet meeting, saying only that the cabinet met [blank] reports on the seriousness of the situation, especially the seriousness of the situation in the east. However, the cabinet members were encouraged again when they heard reports that the French resistance was not weakening. As for rumors that France is about to make a separate peace with Germany, this statement has been denied by official sources, who strongly stated that France's position has not changed. (Havas News Agency dispatch from the 15th)

London - A Reuters reporter asked responsible officials today about rumors from the German and Italian sides. The answer was that the Allies are continuing to cooperate as closely as before. German and Italian radio stations are broadcasting messages in various languages that there are disagreements between British and French civilian and military authorities. It is important to know that these messages are all unfounded. (Reuters dispatch from the 16th)

Editorial

### Far Eastern Stirrings Amidst European Developments

The Allied forces of Britain and France are fighting hard without success, and Paris has finally fallen. This is the most dramatic and significant development in recent days; its significance may only be comparable to the fall of Constantinople in the Middle Ages. However, in today's world, where human reason and intelligence have reached unprecedented levels, it is not necessarily the case that force is the supreme authority! In the past, the fall of Constantinople led to the complete annihilation of Eastern European civilization, which inherited the Greek tradition; but this time, the fall of Paris certainly does not mean the demise of democratic civilization. Of course, after this defeat, the subsequent restoration of order will be ten or a hundred times more difficult; and all people who love freedom and democracy in the world will also feel ten or a hundred times the burden. It is unbearable to look back, judging from conscience, both hating and regretting! But after regret, there are only wise and courageous people who can be steadfast and more motivated to deal with the current and future difficulties. Not only to cope, not only to have such aspirations, but to firmly believe that unless the universe is destroyed in an instant, the return of light is inevitable and not far off.

The United States is a major factor in stabilizing world changes, with its calm and rational observation of world events. Therefore, while paying attention to the situation in Europe, it can also pay close attention to the turbulence in the Far Eastern situation. In recent days, the solemn statements of President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull are precisely expressions of their rationality and a guarantee that democratic civilization will never fall. There is no clearer contrast: in these days of European developments, the so-called reformists in Japan have become very active, taking advantage of the changes in Europe, touting their old tune of joining the German-Italian alliance and vigorously pursuing a southward advance policy. They have seen that the resistance China has encountered in its aggression is no different from divine punishment, and they have divided their efforts to engage in both military and peace offensives against China. They have released all kinds of boring and unbelievable peace rumors, and they have driven their dwindling, exhausted troops to steal the fur of Germany's new battle achievements, launching guerrilla attacks in the hinterland of Central China, and indiscriminately bombing Chinese rear cities with airplanes, initially not showing any restraint due to the US's moral embargo and protests. Instead, they have intensified their actions, even demanding that third-country nationals withdraw from Chongqing. On the part of the major powers, such as the settlement of the Anglo-Japanese Tianjin Incident, and some American politicians advocating accommodating Japan's arguments, are undoubtedly reactions caused by Japan's recent posture. We are not at all surprised, knowing that international situation is so chaotic that whether belligerent or non-belligerent countries, each has its own difficulties. It is inevitable that paying attention to the European situation will neglect other aspects. Therefore, we should not demand perfection with regard to matters related to the Far East. What must be clearly pointed out is that accommodating reality has its insurmountable limits, and that the iron rule of resisting aggression must be adapted to both the West and the Far East. Under the iron rule, there is no room for trickery. But looking at the past two or three years, Britain and France have spent a lot of effort and paid a heavy price to dismantle the German-Italian axis, but the result is still that they cannot prevent Italy from joining the European war. This is an iron fact and an iron lesson under the iron rule. The West and the Far East are the same in this matter.

Japan's offensive against China has not caused China any fear, and China's simple and resolute response is only to resist with real strength. What we want to further explain is that the international situation in the Far East is also very complex. Currently, various forms of turbulence are still developing. What is hoped for from the authorities of the countries concerned is to recognize the following three basic principles:

First, the safety and security of the Far East are actually tied to China's resistance war. For the nine months since the outbreak of the European war, Japan's ambition has been extremely high, but in action, it has always dared not to take risks lightly. This is absolutely not due to the appeasement policy of the major powers, nor is it due to Japan's goodwill towards the major powers. The main reason is that most of Japan's strength has been restrained by China, so that it cannot turn around. Japan's recent indiscriminate offensive against China, including bombing, although has its own internal political reasons, is also sufficient to show its anxiety to end the war. The more firm and powerful China's resistance is, the smaller the possibility of Japan expanding to other areas. In other words, China's resistance and the Far Eastern interests of the major powers are indeed linked. The argument that preparations should be made to make slight concessions to Japan in exchange for its benevolent neutrality is actually ignorant of the overall situation in the Far East. If the interests that are prepared to be given to Japan are used to assist China instead, it can truly achieve the effective result of stabilizing the Far East.

Second, the slogan of the general reformists in Japan is to join the German-Italian alliance. The Allies' willingness to compromise with Japan is also to prevent Japan from colluding with Germany and Italy. However, if Germany really needs Japan's help, then before Germany compromised with the Soviet Union last year, it must first have obtained the understanding of both Italy and Japan. Japan would never be left out in the cold. At that time, the Japanese military delegation was already on its way, but was dejected and returned due to the establishment of the Soviet-German non-aggression pact. This shows that Germany has seen through Japan's exhaustion and is not enough to be used. Recently, when the European war has reached a serious stage, although a part of the Japanese are extremely arrogant, Germany's attitude has turned cold, and there is no sign of welcoming Japan to join their camp. The Japanese calls are just a posture to threaten the Allies.

Third, to deal with aggressors, one can only use strength to make decisive decisions in a timely manner in order to achieve results. Routine protests and empty condemnations only delay the opportunity and are not taken into consideration by those who deliberately aggress. Hull's condemnation of the bombing of Chongqing was met by Japan demanding the evacuation of foreigners in exchange; while the ban on the export of machinery immediately put pressure on Japan, and it engaged in easing the situation diplomatically. This proves what is an effective method. Moreover, most aggressors take advantage of unpreparedness to break out incidents. Therefore, if the other party's alertness and preparation are not sufficient, they will inevitably be caught off guard and unable to cope. In this European war, the Allies have suffered a lot as a result. To maintain the current situation in the Far East, it is essential that the major powers increase their strength for use and ensure a proactive position.

The difficulties in the European situation may not be improved in a short time, but the Far East has a bright future, and the situation is simpler than in Europe, and the measures are easier than in Europe. It only depends on how the people who grasp this opportunity use it.

### US President Replies to French Prime Minister, Resolves Not to Recognize Conquest by Force, Expresses Infinite Admiration for the Heroic Achievements of the French Army, Guarantees Assistance but Not Bound by Military Obligations

Washington - President Roosevelt has assured France that as long as France continues its struggle to defend freedom, the United States will redouble its efforts to aid the Allies with aircraft and military supplies. This guarantee was telegraphed to French Prime Minister Reynaud last night in response to Reynaud's appeal for large numbers of aircraft. Shortly after sending the telegram, President Roosevelt met with the British and French ambassadors. The content of the above telegram is as follows: "I am now replying to your telegram of yesterday. I dare say that you will understand that this telegram has received our most sincere and well-intentioned study. Now, I must first reiterate that the United States, both government and people, pay their infinite admiration to the heroic achievements of the French army in resisting the aggressor in its territory. In addition, I would like to reiterate in the most solemn tone that the US government is making every possible effort under the current circumstances to ensure that the Allied forces have been able to obtain supplies of aircraft, artillery, and various military materials in the past few weeks. As long as the Allied governments continue to resist, the US government will redouble its efforts to provide this assistance. I believe that each week thereafter will see more materials of various kinds being shipped to the Allies. Based on its policy of not recognizing the results of conquest of other people's territories by military aggression, the US government will not recognize as valid any attempt to infringe upon the independence and territorial integrity of France by force. Now, at a time when the French people are heartbroken, I offer you my most sympathetic assurance, and I can continue to assure you that as long as the French continue to defend their freedom, this freedom, which has now become the main reason for all institutions of the world that conform to the popular will, the United States will continuously supply material supplies of increasing quantity and variety. They can rest assured of this. I know that you understand that the above remarks do not contain any military obligations, and only Congress can make such obligations." People here believe that it is impossible for the United States to declare war at present. According to political observers, it is difficult to obtain the approval of Congress at this time, but steps may be taken to adjust various American industries to assist the Allies. After the British and French ambassadors met with President Roosevelt, they solemnly stated to reporters that they had not presented any formal documents to President Roosevelt. When answering a question, French Ambassador Saint-Quentin said that he believed that the Allied military conference would be held regularly in Bordeaux to discuss future plans. (Reuters dispatch from the 16th)

Washington - The British and French ambassadors to Washington held talks with President Roosevelt yesterday for more than an hour. British Ambassador Lord Lothian said after the meeting that the talks "have clarified several things in our minds." (Associated Press dispatch from the 16th)

London - London political circles commented on President Roosevelt's telegram to French Prime Minister Reynaud, saying that the British people were deeply grateful for President Roosevelt's generous response to the French Prime Minister's appeal. It is needless to say that President Roosevelt's assurance that if the Allied governments continued to resist, the United States intended to redouble its efforts to supply aircraft and military supplies, was especially welcomed. The British people fully understand President Roosevelt's explanation that this guarantee did not contain any "military" significance and that "only Congress can make this commitment."

### Analysis by British Intelligence of Hitler's Remarks: Contains the Meaning of Threatening Global Freedom; Britain Determined to Fully Defend Maritime Freedom

London. Intelligence officer and Member of Parliament Nicolson delivered a radio address last night, providing a detailed analysis of Hitler's conversation with Karl Henry von Wiegand, a correspondent for the International News Service. Nicolson stated that Hitler always presents a bouquet of roses with thorns hidden within. Thus, when he assured America that there was no need to fear Germany, he touched upon the Monroe Doctrine, which made Americans uncomfortable, implying that his promise not to attack America would only be valid if the United States continued to refrain from interfering in European affairs. As for Hitler's stated determination to break British sea power and restore what he calls "freedom of the seas," this is a cunning tactic. Millions of Americans will find it pleasing and comforting. In reality, for nearly 150 years, it has been the British Navy that has maintained maritime freedom and benefited both North and South America. Britain has protected the seas from being disrupted by Napoleon, Bismarck, and the German Emperor and will continue to defend the seas from Hitler. This conversation is of great interest. Hitler's warnings were anticipated. When Hitler decided to annex Czechoslovakia, he did not initially announce his intention to annex the whole of it, only claiming that his actions in Czechoslovakia were merely to slightly adjust the German-Czech border. Today, Hitler maintains the same stance, not announcing any intention to destroy Great Britain, and only stating that what he wants to do to the country is merely to seize its colonies and eliminate some well-known British men and women. His emphasis on freedom of the seas is, in fact, aimed at the surrender of the British Navy. If Hitler were to seize our maritime defenses, we would be as powerless as Czechoslovakia was when it lost its land defenses, having no power at all. If we lose it today, Hitler will be in London tomorrow. Is it necessary for people to pay a shameful price to purchase peace, and will we not be able to enjoy peace? We are determined not to pay a shameful price to buy peace. The glory and security of the world are truly in our hands. (Reuters, 16th)

London. A prominent commentator here, referring to Hitler's recent conversation with International News Service correspondent Wiegand, stated that those familiar with Hitler's past history and tactics will immediately understand the meaning of the threat to global freedom contained in Hitler's words. Hitler's phrases "America for the Americans" and "Europe for the Europeans" have revealed Germany's hope for hegemony and will implement an economic policy detrimental to the countries of the Americas. Considering Hitler's past solemn assurances to Austria, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Norway, Denmark, Belgium, and Luxembourg, Hitler's recent statement that he never dreamed of interfering in the Western Hemisphere is more ominous than a harbinger of good fortune. Unfortunately, the reporter asked Hitler about the "Fifth Column" issue. Hitler's denial of responsibility seems laughable to countries that have witnessed or suffered from "Fifth Column" activities. Equally laughable is Nazi Germany's complaint that other countries have failed to treat Nazi spies favorably. In fact, in recent years, Nazi spies have instigated disturbances around the world, and the tolerance shown to these spies and Nazi sympathizers is the reason why every country in the world is facing the danger of "Fifth Column" activities. Regarding Hitler's intentions towards the British Empire, his statements about eliminating figures who would destroy the British Empire and eradicating the plutocracy are tantamount to stating that he intends to wipe out all parties in countries that are united and determined to fight and replace them with puppet Nazi and Fascist governments appointed by him. Hitler's desire to eliminate the so-called British maritime hegemony means that he intends to force Britain to be subject to Hitler's will in maintaining its vital sea lanes. In other words, he intends to reduce Britain to a vassal state, subject to suppression at any time according to Hitler's personal whims. It is quite interesting to compare Hitler's statement that he does not want to smash the British Empire with the declaration made by Propaganda Minister Goebbels in Posen on January 19. Goebbels said, "Germany has only one opinion of Britain, and that is to destroy it." Goebbels also declared to the German people on June 5, "My enemies still refuse peace. The war will be prosecuted to the point of their complete destruction." Finally, Hitler was particularly cautious about declaring his peaceful intentions, because Hitler has never been prepared to put down his instruments of gambling, and he has never clearly stated Germany's wishes. In fact, Germany's "major needs" are inconvenient to define clearly even now, given their limitless nature, and because Hitler will never consider himself satisfied until he has achieved his goal of not only dominating Europe but also the world. Hitler's claim that reason is being restored in various countries means that those countries should be prepared to accept Nazi philosophy and completely submit to Nazi military rule. (Reuters, 16th)

### French Cabinet Meeting: Thorough Discussion of the Diplomatic and Military Situation

Bordeaux. The cabinet this morning continued its state meeting at 11:15 a.m., chaired by President Lebrun. Cabinet Associate General Pétain, Allied Commander-in-Chief General Weygand, and French Naval Commander-in-Chief Vice Admiral Darlan were all in attendance. The meeting discussed the response from U.S. President Roosevelt to Premier Reynaud's appeal. It adjourned at noon and was scheduled to continue in the afternoon to consider the general diplomatic and military situation and study the extent to which France, based on this U.S. response, could continue to fight within its own territory and contribute to the cause of civilized nations. (Havas, 16th)

### Lindbergh Opposes Involvement in War; Attacks the Government Severely

Washington. Famous aviator Colonel Lindbergh delivered a radio address to the nation today, stating that the countries of the Americas should cooperate to defend the Western Hemisphere and that the government's current policy of "meddling in foreign affairs" is not appropriate. Our immediate priority is to establish a clear national defense plan and work with the countries of the Americas to achieve it. To protect our security, we must establish various military bases in necessary locations, regardless of which country the territory belongs to. Once our defenses are sufficient, foreign troops will have no possibility of invading us. The government's current policies will lead our country into the whirlpool of war. If these policies continue, we will no longer be able to consider ourselves a great nation. Look at our position today. The officials in power have caused us to lose the power that we could have wielded as the world's largest neutral country. We are only selling small quantities of arms to Britain and France, which has little impact on the outcome of the war, and this war cannot be changed by our military strength. Since our founding, we have always demanded that foreign countries not interfere in the affairs of the Western Hemisphere, but we ourselves often interfere in the affairs of other countries. Is this not self-contradictory? What we are doing to Britain and France now is exactly the same as what those countries did to Czechoslovakia, Poland, Finland, and Norway before, namely, encouraging those countries and hoping that we will provide impossible assistance. The lesson is not far off. If we do not know how to change our ways, will we not be missing a major opportunity? Furthermore, the matter of our country sending troops to participate in the war is out of the question. Even if we want to send a small number of troops, it will take considerable time to train them. Far water cannot quench a nearby fire. Moreover, after our country enters the war, our position will change, and there will be various problems to deal with. In short, we must clearly recognize the current facts, even if we do not welcome these facts. The fact is that before we take effective action in the European war, German troops may have already controlled the entire Europe. In that case, Europe will be controlled by a powerful military state unlike any other in history, and the population it controls will soon be larger than our country. Today, American citizens are at the crossroads of war and peace. Are we, as the world's powerful nation, going to let the independent destiny created by our ancestors' sacrifice of life flow into the East, or are we willing to be dragged into the endless wars of the Old Continent and be unable to extricate ourselves, or are we going to strengthen our own defenses and let the European countries deal with the European war themselves? Which way to go awaits our decisive decision. (Havas, 15th)

### Sketches of Paris Under the Nazi Boot: Filled with Desolation, Like a Dead City

Paris. The reporter flew from Berlin on Friday evening and arrived here, only to see that this prosperous French capital had completely changed its appearance and become a dead city. The Nazi swastika flag flies over the Arc de Triomphe, the Eiffel Tower, the Hotel Ville, and other locations in Paris. Most of the people here fled in panic as German troops approached the gates of Paris. According to estimates by the Paris police, the number of residents who have left the city and fled elsewhere has reached ten percent. In the lush forests surrounding Paris, many refugees have been hiding. Only yesterday did they return to Paris under the German boot. As the German troops marched triumphantly into the city, a small number of people who remained in the city and had not left gathered at the doors of their homes or on the roadsides to watch the arrival of the victorious army. It is said that German leader Hitler will also come here in a few days, but it is not known whether he will inspect the troops after his arrival. When the reporter arrived here at eight o'clock on Friday night, the American flag was still flying high on the roof of the embassy. It is believed that the ambassador to France must still be in the city. Military officials said that dozens of German soldiers arrived here yesterday, and German soldiers continue to arrive. German sentries in gray uniforms are stationed in front of various buildings occupied by German military institutions. The reporter witnessed Mr. Russel following the officers of the German General Headquarters, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Ministry of Propaganda to this place. Our group consisted of ten foreign reporters, including three American reporters. I am one of the members of this group. We arrived here within ten hours after the Germans entered the city. The first team of German soldiers entered the city very quietly and orderly. At nine o'clock in the evening, they ordered all residents to turn off their lights, and the entire city became dark and silent. The sounds of the German soldiers' boots could be heard incessantly. Looking back, everything was desolate. The sounds of newspaper vendors shouting were no longer heard, and there were no more scenes of people drinking happily in restaurants. All the famous French restaurants, theaters, bars, and most hotels were closed. (United Press, 16th)

### Italian Military Communiqué: Claims Naval Victory, One French Ship Sunk

Rome. An official Italian army communiqué stated that Italian forces continued reconnaissance on the Alpine border, which the enemy tried to hinder without success, and was captured by Italian forces. One person and lost automatic weapons. Naval and air forces continued operations in the Mediterranean. Italian destroyers sank an enemy submarine. The Italian Air Force bombed French air force bases and port facilities in Corsica, and bombed the ordnance factories of Malta, Brindisi, and Mola. Seventy Italian fighter planes launched a large-scale and daring attack on Rennes, La Motte, and other places in southern France. During the fierce battle between the planes, Italian planes destroyed forty enemy planes and several planes on the ground. A large armory was destroyed, and several fires broke out. Five Italian planes were lost. The offensive against British forces in North Africa is ongoing. The British forces, aided by a large number of tanks, attempted to attack towards Sidi Azzaz. In East Africa, a squadron of Italian planes attacked the air force bases of Berbera and Mandera. Two British planes attempted to attack Mayunwa and were shot down. On the night of June 15, enemy planes made ordinary attacks in the skies over mainland Italy. Several bombs fell on Genoa, killing and injuring several civilians. Land suffered only minor damage. Italian anti-aircraft guns shot down four enemy planes. (Reuters, 16th)

Rome. Yesterday was the fifth day after Italy entered the war, celebrating the first victory of the Italian Navy, namely, an Italian destroyer of 967 tons fought alone with four French destroyers and sank a French destroyer twice its tonnage. The Italian ship's name is "Calatafimi." Calatafimi is a place name located in Sicily. On May 15, 1860, 1,000 Italian volunteers on the island defeated General Landi, greatly influencing the Sardinian campaign. Its victory can be regarded as the preliminary stage of the last victory of Italy at that time. Therefore, the victory of the Calatafimi is generally regarded as an auspicious sign of this war. As for the name of the French destroyer that was sunk, the official has not yet announced it. What is known is that the ship is a "Dalto" type, built in 1932, with a tonnage of 2,441 tons, equipped with five 13.8 cm cannons, four 13 cm cannons, several anti-aircraft guns, and six torpedo tubes. The Italian ship was commanded by a young captain named Bellinor, born in 1906. (Telecommunications, 16th)

### British Churches of All Denominations Hold a Day of Prayer: Barbarity Constitutes a Sin and Will Inevitably Reap Its Own Reward

London. British churches of all denominations have held a day of prayer for France. Dean of Westminster Norwood spoke of the madness of mechanized forces in attack, saying that the fate of the world's freedom now hangs in the balance.

### Japanese Planes Attacked Chongqing in Four Waves Yesterday: 150 Japanese Planes Indiscriminately Bombed; Hundreds of Bombs Dropped, Casualties Still Few

Chongqing. This afternoon, Japanese bombers attacked Chongqing again in four waves. The bombing lasted for about two hours and caused several fires. The Chongqing Hotel, where all foreigners resided, was destroyed by three bombs. All foreign tourists took refuge in the nearby air-raid shelters and were not injured. The first alarm was issued shortly after noon. An hour later, the first batch of 36 Japanese planes dropped bombs on the lower city of Chongqing. Incendiary bombs caused a large fire, which spread rapidly and was extinguished after three hours. A team of Chinese fighter planes fought fiercely with the Japanese planes. An hour later, three more batches of Japanese bombers bombed the western suburbs of Chongqing. The Chinese anti-aircraft gun teams opened fire and bombarded them fiercely. Chinese fighter planes also took off to intercept them. The alarm was lifted at 3:30 p.m. (Reuters, 16th)

Chongqing. At 3:00 p.m. today, Chongqing suffered another extremely serious and brutal air raid. 150 Japanese planes dropped more than 800 large bombs in the skies over Chongqing, both inside the old-style brick city and outside the modern city of Chongqing, destroying more than 3,000 houses. It is heard that the casualties in this air raid were very small, because many residents had been evacuated to other places two weeks ago. Many new-style government buildings were destroyed in today's air raid. The famous Chongqing Hotel, where most foreigners and journalists lived, has now been completely destroyed. The old-style brick city has suffered two bombings in four days, and the losses have been very heavy. Entire streets and entire residential areas have been completely changed, turning tall buildings into rubble. No less than 2,000 buildings in the city have been burned down. Many parts of Chongqing are still on fire, especially near the foreign hotels. The water pipes have been broken, so the intense fire cannot be contained. The air-raid alarm was issued at noon, giving the local people two hours to calmly take refuge in air-raid shelters or other suitable places. After the alarm was lifted, the Chongqing air-raid authorities prohibited people from approaching their destroyed homes, because they feared that some of the bombs dropped by the Japanese planes might not have exploded and could cause another accident. The streets of Chongqing are full of ruins and rubble, and there are bomb craters everywhere, so firefighters and paramedics can hardly do their work. In the last air raid, Japanese planes dropped more than 150 bombs and incendiary bombs, which have already destroyed many parts of the city. This bombing was even more fierce than the last one. (United Press, 16th)

### One Week of War Situation: June 9 to June 15

Chongqing. A spokesman for the Military Affairs Commission said that the war this week was still the most intense in central Hubei. The Chinese army implemented its plan step by step, achieving glorious results. Now the Japanese west of the Xiang River are staggering between Dangyang and Yichang, and Yichang is in the Chinese encirclement. The time for its complete annihilation is imminent. In other war zones, the Chinese army is also actively attacking the Japanese, causing the Japanese army to collapse day by day. The important war results of this week are briefly described as follows:

Henan and Hubei

Since the Japanese invaded Xiangyang last week and were defeated by the Chinese, with thousands killed, they again crossed the river on the Han-Yi Road front and invaded westward. In order to achieve the annihilation of the main force of the entire Japanese army in that direction, the Chinese army resisted step by step, killing seven or eight thousand Japanese soldiers, and gradually lured the Japanese deep into the encirclement. At the same time, the large army that had turned to the rear of the Japanese army pressed towards the Japanese from all directions, first clearing the remaining Japanese north of Jingmen and Dangyang, and in one fell swoop recapturing Yuan'an, killing more than a thousand Japanese soldiers and capturing more than 300 horses, hundreds of rifles, more than 120 mountain gun shells, more than 80 pairs of rifle bullets, and more than 3,000 meters of rice. The Japanese are now surrounded by the Chinese in the mountainous area west of Dangyang, making it difficult to advance or retreat. The Chinese army has also dispatched extremely rapid and capable troops to control all the crossings along the Xiang River and take the opportunity to attack Jiangling and Shashi, and another unit of soldiers has directly attacked Hanyang, further cutting off the Japanese rear. By noon on the 14th, the Chinese army had completed a certain objective action, and the encirclement and annihilation campaign in western Xiangyang was about to unfold gradually under extremely favorable conditions. Near Xinyang in southern Henan, there were also fierce battles between Chinese and Japanese forces on the 7th, killing more than 200 Japanese soldiers. At the same time, the puppet troops Wang Xiangfa, Sun Dajing, and He Laoba led more than 2,000 troops to revolt one after another, thwarting the Japanese attempt to "use Chinese to control Chinese."

Guangdong and Guangxi

The Chinese army in southern Guangdong chased after the Japanese and pressed straight to Jiekou. The Japanese reinforced and counterattacked the Chinese units at Yi Feng Yuan, Guantian, Guancun, Ji Du Qiao, Xian County Gang, and other places. After the Chinese army bravely charged and killed four Japanese officers, including Lieutenant Colonel Brigade Commander Rie Haruto Kizo Nakamuteng, and more than ten other officers and soldiers, including Ozaki Masa, all of whom are continuing their advance.

### Hull Says Japan Did Not Ask the U.S. Envoy to Leave Chongqing

Washington. U.S. Secretary of State Hull told reporters here yesterday that he had not heard that the Japanese had asked the U.S. Embassy in Chongqing to withdraw. The U.S. Embassy has long been on the opposite side of the Yangtze River. He learned that the Japanese had warned other countries' embassies in Chongqing and U.S. citizens to temporarily evacuate Chongqing. He thought this was another example of a belligerent nation wanting to notify civilians before an attack. (United Press, 16th)

### Large-Scale Scuffle in the Outskirts of Shantou; Japanese Troops Attempt to Cross the Tuojiang River to Invade Guanbu; Chinese Troops Launch Attacks on Shantou from Multiple Routes

Shantou Dispatch: After the city of Chaozhou was besieged by Chinese troops, the Japanese forces, though holding fast to their strongholds, were subjected to east-west assaults along the railway line by the Chinese, who gained the initiative. Consequently, the Japanese were unable to extend their reach towards Jieyang and Chenghai. On May 13th, the Japanese launched an attack from Fuyang, striking the Qingma Mountain, Lianhu, and Baishui areas bordering Anjie Road, charging as far as the outskirts of Yu’e City, where they were annihilated by the Chinese Chen Regiment. The Japanese then resorted to artillery bombardment of Jieyang, Xigang, Guigang, and Dengtang City. The Chinese Wu Regiment launched flanking attacks from Guxiang, Linmapo, and Aoling Mountain, even storming into Chao'an Chuncheng Tower. As a result, the Japanese forces in Chao'an, after repeated unsuccessful attempts to break out, could only hold their ground in the Chihu, Matuanxiasi, and Fengxi areas in the southwestern suburbs. The Chinese special operations Wang Regiment then launched night attacks on Yinhu, Caitang, and Huamei on the 15th, 16th, and 17th, achieving a major victory, and together with the Gu Regiment of Sangpu Mountain, formed a united front, gradually closing in on the outskirts of Shantou City. Currently, a semicircular encirclement line has been completed from Guanshan Township outside Chenghai City, via Anbu, to Pengzhousuo and Tuopu City, only eight miles from Shantou City. Transportation from Chao'an to Shantou has also been cut off by guerrilla forces, causing great panic among the Japanese and their puppets. The Japanese army opened fire indiscriminately from the East Gate of Chenghai City. On the 17th, they dispatched 200 artillery soldiers, traveling by motorboat to cross the Dongxi River, a tributary of the Han River, and invaded villages in the Chengyanggang area. Various local militias fought back for two hours, causing over 50 casualties to the Japanese and their puppets, who fled back to Chenghai City in disarray. However, the villages along the Dongxi River suffered greatly from the Japanese troops' devastation, incurring significant losses. The Chinese troops then pursued their advantage, crossing the Lianyang River to attack the city. At dawn on the 18th, 300 Japanese and puppet soldiers launched two-pronged attacks: one from Beidou directly towards Longtian, harassing Beilong Huafu; and the other from Ximen, exiting Fenghuakeng, ostensibly searching for guerrillas but in reality looting from the civilians along the way and arresting over 100 able-bodied men. The people closed the gates of their villages and rose up in resistance, resulting in a melee that lasted three hours. Fortunately, the arrested men were rescued, and the Japanese and puppet soldiers suffered dozens of casualties. Those who harassed Guanshan Township were also defeated by the militia and fled in disarray back to Chenghai City. From the 19th onward, Chinese militia teams gathered from all directions like ants, each closing the gates of their villages, not allowing outsiders to enter, thus severing transportation between Shantou and Chenghai. That morning, the sound of gunfire suddenly erupted outside Shantou City, causing shops in the city not to dare open for business. It was reported that large numbers of Chinese troops had arrived on Sangpu Mountain, and Japanese planes continuously flew over for reconnaissance. Shantou and Anbu jointly dispatched 400 to 500 Japanese soldiers to meet the enemy below Sangpu Mountain. Six miles from Shantou City, they encountered the Chinese Gu Regiment, and a fierce battle broke out at Pengzhousuo and Zhuanglong Mountain at 10:00 AM on the 19th. Anbu, where the Japanese Eastern Route Commander Horino was stationed, had its headquarters in Guanlutou, and fortified artillery positions had been built nearby on Panlong Mountain and Wuta Gang. Pengzhou and Zhuanglong, three miles from Anbu, were heavily bombarded by Japanese artillery, with nearly 1,000 shells fired. The sound of the shelling could be heard in Shantou City. The Gu Regiment, suppressed by the artillery fire, retreated back to Sangpu Mountain. Five to six hundred Japanese and puppet troops pursued them to Pengzhousuo and Tuopu City, hastily building artillery positions and opening fire on Guanbu across the river. They collected thirty to forty fishing boats and sampans, and the Japanese shallow-water warships in Shantou sailed to the mouth of the Tuojiang River, intending to provide cover for the Japanese troops crossing the river to attack Guanbu. Guanbu belongs to Chaoyang County and could bypass Guiyu Bridge and enter Puning Lihu, attaching to the rear of Jieyang Mianhu. At 3:00 PM on the 19th, Chinese reinforcements arrived and launched a fierce counterattack on Tuopu, engaging in a fierce battle for three hours. The Japanese and puppet troops suffered over 100 casualties. As dusk approached, the Japanese dared not cross the river, and the remnants fled towards Anbu Panlong Mountain. That evening, Chinese troops dispersed into several routes, penetrating deep into the suburbs of the city, building countless "plum blossom" earth dugouts. Soldiers hid in the hollows, firing cold shots to challenge the Japanese troops in Shantou and Anbu. Gunfire was heard everywhere, but no one could be seen. Transportation between Shantou and Anbu was completely cut off. Every night, Chinese troops formed teams to attack Japanese strongholds. This has been going on for three days and nights, and the outskirts of Shantou City have fallen into a state of chaos.

### Fujian Province Constructs New Villages; Plans for Balanced Development of Rural Villages and Cities; and Issues Real Estate Investment Certificates

Yong'an Dispatch: Fujian Province is mountainous, so the culture of this province has always been concentrated in several coastal cities. The population of the province in the ninth year of the Daoguang era of the Qing Dynasty was over 17 million. According to the survey in the 24th year of the Republic of China, it was only over 12 million. Although there are many reasons for the recent decrease in the population of this province, the unsanitary housing conditions and the prevalence of epidemics everywhere have a great impact on the health of the people. Since the War of Resistance, the provincial government has paid great attention to the people's

housing problem

in order to disperse the coastal population, develop inland resources, and complete the economic construction of the province. The Fujian Provincial Bank, in order to assist in construction and improve housing problems throughout the province, has built a total of eight new villages inside and outside Yong'an City, where the provincial capital is located, all of which have been built in places with beautiful environments and scenery. As for the internal equipment, it only seeks to be economical and beautiful. Among them, four have been completed and rented out, and others are underway in Nanping, Sanyuan, Sha County and other places. The Fujian Provincial Bank has another important purpose in building new villages, which is to seek balanced development between rural villages and cities, to make cities pastoral and pastoral areas urban. This is not only sufficient to prevent enemy aircraft from bombing during wartime, but also serves as a model for the people when the government is currently promoting the new county system and implementing local autonomy. It is reported that the bank is based on the economic principles of social undertakings, taking into account the

situation of new villages

around the world and issuing real estate investment certificates, divided into two types: National Currency, one yuan and one hundred yuan, with a term of five years, guaranteed by the bank to protect the principal and interest, allowing the public to purchase and freely transfer them. Certificate holders may also inherit real estate equivalent to the value of the bank's investment in real estate. Before the principal is due, dividends can be distributed. This measure can enable "residents" to have their own "houses," and people have the benefits of real estate without the stagnation of funds, which can be said to be a gain in many ways.

### The Japanese Side Fails to Win Over Overseas Chinese

Fuzhou Dispatch: In order to disperse China's resistance forces, the Japanese side has been trying its best to seduce overseas Chinese to betray their motherland. For the past two years, they have designed various methods, but they have been seen through by the overseas Chinese and have failed. The Japanese agency in Fujian that seduces overseas Chinese is the South China Liaison Department of the Asia Development Board in Xiamen. Therefore, Xiamen can also be said to be the central location for seducing overseas Chinese in Fujian Province. Its work can be divided into two stages. The first stage was to use strong-arm tactics, block the sea ports, concentrate the entry and exit of overseas Chinese in Gulangyu, confiscate the property of anti-Japanese overseas Chinese in Xiamen City, bombard the Tong'an Jimei School run by Chen Jiageng, and bomb Xiamen University in Changting, as revenge for Chen's leadership of overseas Chinese in Nanyang to engage in the patriotic movement, hoping to threaten the overseas Chinese and soften them. However, the overseas Chinese are very determined. Although the entrances and exits have been blocked, they would rather go through Shanghai than through Xiamen. As for the confiscation of property, they all believe that they can be fully recovered when the War of Resistance is successful, otherwise they will be occupied by the Japanese and Taiwanese. The bombing by aircraft and the bombardment by warships only increased their indignation. At the same time, when the Japanese saw that overseas Chinese in various places in Nanyang were enthusiastically purchasing legal tender from the Bank of China and the Overseas Chinese Bank, they also transported the legal tender they had plundered in the occupied areas to Nanyang to sell it in the hope of exchanging it for foreign currency, which was also discovered and rejected by the overseas Chinese. Therefore, the strong-arm tactics used by the Japanese side completely failed. The second stage was to use gentle tactics, setting up a puppet Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau in Xiamen, appointing the fatuous and old Chen Kewei as the puppet director, setting up an Overseas Chinese Reception Center in Gulangyu, organizing a puppet Overseas Chinese Association in Hong Kong, and sending traitors Hong Lixun and Huang Lianfang to Nanyang to persuade overseas Chinese, vainly hoping that overseas Chinese would participate in puppet organizations. The Osaka Economic Inspection Group sent Nakata Morio, Ishii Soitsu, and Komatsu Genmao to Xiamen to form the Xiamen Construction Company, absorbing overseas Chinese funds to supply their occupation of Xiamen's industry and commerce. However, the overseas Chinese already knew their scam and no one responded. Hong Lixun and Huang Lianfang were successively shot and killed in Gulangyu. Therefore, the gentle tactics used by the Japanese side also completely failed. Now, because the Chinese army has won victories in all battles on the various battlefields, the Xiamen Japanese and puppet newspapers rarely publish war reports. They only promote the peace movement, hoping to deceive the public, which also shows that their efforts are becoming increasingly futile.

### Eastern Fujian Pirates Fight Among Themselves; Yongli Ship Chased and Robbed by Japanese Warships; Heavy Losses

Fuzhou Dispatch: The pirate leader Yu A'huang in eastern Fujian, under the command of the Japanese, led a thousand pirates, rampaging on the sea, appearing and disappearing between Meizhou and Pingtan Islands, intercepting merchants and travelers without any scruples. The Japanese also used them to harass the coast, calling them the "Naval Guerrilla Team." After the Chinese army launched an expedition to suppress them, they disintegrated. Yu was hit by a bullet and went to Xiamen to heal his wounds, but soon died of serious injuries. The remnants, led by Weng Shanggong and Wang Fuming, two groups, quarreled over the unequal distribution of spoils and were incompatible. However, their strength was almost completely lost, and they did not dare to disturb the southeastern coast of eastern Fujian under the control of the Chinese army. In late last month, they led the remnants, took separate sailboats to escape to Xiamen. On the way, they fought again. At a distance of dozens of meters, they threw grenades at each other. The Wang bandits were inferior in manpower and equipment, and suffered heavier casualties. During the melee, Wang suddenly disappeared. It is said that he was hit by a bullet and fell into the sea. After Weng arrived in Xiamen, he was detained by the Japanese. It is also expected that the bandits will end up like this after doing so much evil.

Lan Rubo, the local emperor who previously dominated the Shima area, has since been executed. His seventh prince, Lan Buqing, who had transformed from the Three Dots Zeng bandit into a scourge to the country, led more than 300 pirates a month ago from Jianjiangkou Baiquanyang and stationed in Heshan, Xiamen, under the command of Lin Chun. Import and export ships in southern Fujian all load and unload goods outside Quanzhou Port, which aroused the attention of the Japanese. A few days ago, the British Yongli ship carried passengers and goods from Shanghai to Quanzhou. After the passengers disembarked, while the ship was unloading goods, a Japanese warship suddenly followed and immediately lowered the dinghy to chase and rob the ship. At that time, more than 20 barges were prepared to load goods onto the ship, and three of them were already full of goods. When they saw the Japanese boat chasing, they hurriedly sailed into the port. However, because they were heavily loaded and moved slowly, they could not escape and were intercepted and taken away, resulting in a loss of more than 200,000 yuan. According to investigations, the Yongli ship carried a total of 12,374 pieces of goods to Quanzhou this time, including 4,450 pieces of fertilizer powder, 3,900 pieces of soybean cake, 2,500 pieces of wheat bran, and 286 pieces of cloth. The others were cotton yarn, medicinal materials, etc. The goods unloaded onto the barges that were burned and robbed were 324 pieces of fertilizer powder, 615 pieces of wheat bran, 30 pieces of casehead cloth, 4 pieces of cotton yarn, and 3 pieces of medicinal herbs. However, it is not yet known how many people were on board. The British Xinyangtai ship also transported goods from Shanghai to Quanzhou the next day. Knowing that the Yongli ship had been burned and robbed, it immediately sailed away.

### Amidst the Sound of Large Armies Entering the Country, Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Flies to Riga; Discusses the Organization of a People's Front Cabinet; Rumors that the President of Lithuania Has Fled

Riga: A delegation from the Soviet government, led by Deputy Foreign Minister Kanoev, has flown here to discuss the new situation and the organization of a new Lithuanian government. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov does not approve of General Rastikis, the former commander-in-chief of the Lithuanian army, being appointed to organize a new government. According to Soviet news, Lithuania accepted the Soviet ultimatum yesterday, recognizing the Soviet Union's right to occupy Lithuanian territory and station sufficient troops there. As a result, the Lithuanian government resigned. (Reuters Dispatch on the 16th)

Riga: The Soviet delegation met with the Lithuanian President this morning to discuss the organization of a People's Front Cabinet. The situation here is calm, but the Germans are deeply concerned about the current situation in Lithuania. (Havas Dispatch on the 16th)

Riga: The new Lithuanian cabinet has not yet been announced. On this matter, Foreign Minister Urbšys is exchanging views with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov in Moscow. According to well-informed sources here, Urbšys will continue to hold his original post. (Havas Dispatch on the 16th)

Berlin: The German official news agency quoted a dispatch from the capital of Lithuania saying that the Soviet army had crossed the border into Lithuania at three locations yesterday afternoon, intending to occupy Riga, the capital of Estonia, and other important locations. (Reuters Dispatch on the 16th)

Riga: Lithuanian President Smetona left his official residence last night, with his family accompanying him. It is generally believed that he has fled abroad. Smetona is 70 years old and has been the President since 1920. Officials here declared that the Lithuanian government believed that the President's escape meant his resignation. The Lithuanian constitution stipulates that when the President leaves office, he should be succeeded by the Prime Minister. However, the current Prime Minister has also resigned. Therefore, the government will negotiate with the Soviet representatives. Soviet troops are entering Lithuania, and the roads leading here are full of Soviet Red Army soldiers. The train station is also crowded with troops, and there are tanks and motorcycles patrolling the streets at night. The Lithuanian government issued a notice to the people this morning, stating that Soviet troops are stationed in Lithuania in accordance with the Soviet-Lithuanian Mutual Assistance Treaty. The current tense situation in Europe requires an increase in defense forces to ensure safety. The Soviet Union has sent additional troops to Lithuania on the 15th and stationed them at designated locations. The people of the whole country should maintain a calm attitude, focus on their own businesses, and obey government orders, strictly observe discipline, and maintain public order. (Haitong News Agency Dispatch on the 16th)

Other locations will be decided by General Pavlov of the Soviet Russia and the Lithuanian Commander-in-Chief today." The Lithuanian official news agency stated that in order to avoid unpleasant events, the Lithuanian government has ordered Lithuanian (troops) not to resist the Soviet troops entering the country. (Haitong News Agency Dispatch on the 16th)

Soviet Union Announces the Truth about the Dispute

Moscow: The dispute between the Soviet Union and Lithuania has been resolved. The truth and details are now announced here as follows:

"On June 14th, Soviet People's Commissar Molotov, on behalf of the Soviet government, sent a protest to Lithuanian Foreign Minister Urbšys (who is currently staying in Moscow), to be forwarded to the Lithuanian government. The protest stated: 'As a result of the recent exchange of views between Molotov and Urbšys in Moscow, the Soviet government believes that the following facts are very clear: (1) In recent months, incidents of kidnapping Red Army personnel have occurred in Lithuania. They have been subjected to cruel torture and forced to disclose military secrets (the Soviet troops stationed in Lithuanian territory are in accordance with the Mutual Assistance Treaty between the two countries). Red Army personnel Butaev was not only kidnapped, but also assassinated by the Lithuanian police after the Soviet government requested his release. As for Soviet soldiers Pisarev and Shamava Ganots, they were lucky enough to escape after being cruelly tortured by the Lithuanian police, but Soviet soldier Sutov has not been found. The Lithuanian authorities' actions are nothing more than trying to prevent the Red Army from staying in Lithuania. In addition, recently, Soviet employees (such as laundresses, cooks, etc.) have been expelled or sent to concentration camps, and workers who built barracks for the Soviet army have also been arrested. This illegal action against the Lithuanian people not only prevents the Red Army from staying in Lithuania, but also causes hostility towards the Soviet army, preparing to attack the Red Army stationed in Lithuania. The above facts prove that the Lithuanian government has violated the Soviet-Lithuanian Mutual Assistance Treaty and is preparing to attack all Red Army personnel stationed in Lithuania in accordance with the Mutual Assistance Treaty. (2) After the Lithuanian government and the Soviet Union concluded the Mutual Assistance Treaty, it formed a military alliance with Latvia and Estonia, thereby changing the so-called Baltic Little Entente into a three-nation alliance. The Soviet government has determined that this alliance is directed against the Soviet Union. Since Lithuania joined the alliance, the secret consultations between the staff officers of the three countries have become more frequent. In February 1940, this military alliance even published a 'Baltic Review,' which was printed in English, French, and German. The above facts prove that the Lithuanian government has violated the Soviet-Lithuanian Mutual Assistance Treaty, because according to Article 6 of the treaty, neither party may join an alliance directed against the other. Such actions in violation of the Mutual Assistance Treaty and the extreme hostility of the Lithuanian government towards the Soviet Union are contrary to the Soviet Union's pro-Lithuanian policy. For example, the Soviet Union would automatically transfer Vilnius and the Vilnius region to Lithuania.

Three Requests Made to Lithuania

The Soviet government believes that the current situation has changed, and Lithuania must implement the following conditions: (1) Lithuanian Interior Minister Skarga and Political Police Minister Povlaitis, who are in charge of anti-Soviet actions, should be impeached immediately. (2) Lithuania should immediately form a government that can abide by the Mutual Assistance Treaty and suppress all those who oppose the treaty. (3) Soviet troops must be stationed at various important points in numbers sufficient to maintain the implementation of the Mutual Assistance Treaty and to deal with all provocative actions. The Soviet government believes that these requirements are the minimum requirements and must be implemented, otherwise the Soviet-Lithuanian Mutual Assistance Treaty will never be effective. The Soviet side expects the Lithuanian government to reply before 10:00 AM on June 15th, otherwise the Soviet government will consider the request to have been rejected.

### Japan's Southern Advance Becomes More Urgent; Britain, U.S., and France Cannot Afford to Err Again; If Britain Compromises, It Will Regret It Later; The United States Should Assume the Difficult Task at This Time; China Review Weekly Urges Britain to Clarify Its Far Eastern Policy

The Shanghai-based North China Daily News's Tokyo special cable of June 14th states that many observers here believe that France will be forced to surrender. If so, it is expected that the policy towards French Vietnam and the French colony of New Caledonia in the South Pacific will be more aggressive than the policy towards the East Indies. Vietnam borders the territory occupied by Japan in China and is close to Hainan Island. Furthermore, Japan has protested against the alleged arson of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway transport. New Caledonia has important interests for Japanese residents in the operation of nickel and iron. The Japanese now expect France to make peace separately and are openly discussing the distribution of French colonies.

Building Fortifications on Mandated Islands

An American named Granger writes in Asia magazine that the Japanese have been deliberately operating the international mandated islands in the Pacific in recent years, hoping to use them as a base for their southern advance when international winds become tense, threatening the territories and interests of Britain and France in the South Pacific. The article points out that in the past five years, the Japanese have worked hard to develop air transport on the above-mentioned islands. First, they implemented the opening of air routes to Japan. All the detailed weather conditions and air currents around the islands are under Japanese control. Recently, the Japanese have also planned to open air routes to Australia and New Guinea. The facilities of the seaports and airfields built by the Japanese on the various islands are so large in scale that they have aroused the suspicion of the International Mandated Territories Committee. According to investigations, the Japanese have violated international regulations and have indeed built fortifications on the islands. Australians firmly believe that Truk in the Caroline Islands and Joroit in the Marshall Islands have indeed been fortified, but there is no definite evidence to confirm this. The article concludes that the Japanese are using these islands to defend Japan's position in East Asia, to invade America's defense money, to the south to Australia and New Zealand, and to the east to British, French, and Dutch territories. If war breaks out, the Japanese can also cut off the connection between the United States and the Philippines and Malaya. The threat to the interests of national countries in the South Pacific can be imagined.

China Review Weekly Urges Britain to Be Aware

The China Review Weekly recently commented on Britain's Far Eastern policy, saying, "The Japanese are using the pretext of maintaining the status quo of the Dutch East Indies, but they have other ambitions. This can be clearly seen from Arita's speech at the Tokyo Pacific Conference on the 3rd of this month. According to Arita, 'If the great powers refuse to participate in the economic development of the Dutch East Indies, then a conflict between Japan and the Western countries will be unavoidable.' Although Arita's speech repeatedly mentioned the Dutch East Indies, he did not make a clear distinction with the Hainan area. What he meant actually included the locations of British, American, and French interests in the Far East. His intention was no different from issuing a warning to Britain, France, and the United States. Japan will occupy these areas by force, just as it has invaded China.

British and French Territories Are Surrounded by Crises

The Japanese have also concentrated naval forces on the southern coast of China N Hainan Island to threaten the South Seas territories of Britain, France, and the United States. Observing the United States's stern attitude towards Japan, we can believe that the Japanese may not suddenly use force against the Dutch East Indies and the Philippines, but observing that Britain and France are in the midst of fierce battles with Germany and have no time to look east, the Far Eastern territories of France and Britain are likely to be attacked by the Japanese navy at any time, satisfying their greed. If the Japanese did not fall so deeply into the quagmire in China, the Japanese would have invaded Hong Kong and Annam long ago.

If Tolerance Continues, They Will Suffer the Consequences

Therefore, what the Japanese are most anxious and urgently trying to end is the war against China. According to reliable reports, along with the news of the Japanese navy gathering on Hainan Island, the Japanese central government has already begun its so-called "Far Eastern Issue" negotiations, and the Japanese are threatening Britain and France to force them to agree to end the "China Incident," creating an Eastern Munich Conference. This report has aroused the surprise of Chinese officials, who have instructed the Chinese Ambassador to Britain to lodge a serious protest with the British government. The British side may, because of the pressure from the Germans in Europe, try to compromise and preserve its Far Eastern territories. This view is completely wrong. It must be known that the Japanese are difficult to satisfy. If Britain and France satisfy their desires, Japan will go even further and brazenly seize the Far Eastern interests of Britain, France, and the United States.

The European and Asian Wars of Resistance Have the Same Goal

Even more, what Britain and France are currently craving is the help of the United States, and their goal in fighting Germany is also clear, saying that it is "to maintain democracy and liberate Europe from the yoke of Germany." However, China's heroic resistance in Asia also has the same meaning, and the Japanese "New Order in East Asia" and the German "New Order" are no different. Therefore, Britain, France, and China should be in the same camp to fight against violence and defeat those ambitious people in mankind.

The United States Should Assert Something Urgently

Looking back on the past, when the United States sought the assistance of Britain and France to maintain peace in the East, it was always rejected by Britain and France. Now that Britain and France are in a position in Europe like China, they hope for the assistance of the United States again. Therefore, the United States has the right to propose to Britain and France at this time not to compromise with Japan and create an Eastern Munich Conference. The establishment of the Japanese "New Order in East Asia" is not only very unfavorable to China, but also a major blow to the Far Eastern interests of the United States. The establishment of democracy in Europe is in the life-and-death struggle of Britain and France, but the war in Asia and the war in Europe are inseparably related.

Britain Should Not Be Afraid of the Far East

China has been fighting for freedom and justice for three years, and victory is in sight. People all over the world are giving it sympathy, but China's enemies are being supplied with the raw materials they need for war by various countries, and this contradictory behavior is especially evident in the United States. However, under such circumstances, China's fighting strength is stronger and its determination to resist the enemy is stronger. Its spirit is truly amazing. After the reorganization of the British cabinet, there is generally no fear of the war in Europe. We sincerely hope that the British government will not be threatened by the Japanese and be afraid of the Far East. In this way, the Allied forces will have firm confidence, American sympathy can be deepened, and the Chinese people also look forward to it. Prime Minister Churchill should urgently clarify Britain's Far Eastern policy to dispel outside doubts about Britain. At the same time, he should actively cooperate with the United States to maintain peace in the Hainan area of China and shatter the Japanese dream.

### Various Circles in Shanghai Commemorated Yesterday the Martyrdom of the Premier in Guangzhou; Resolved to Emulate the National Father's Spirit of Steadfastness and Unyielding; Determine Conviction to Complete the Great Undertaking of Resistance and Construction

Yesterday was the 18th anniversary of the National Father's martyrdom in Guangzhou. According to central regulations, it is combined with the London martyrdom commemoration on October 11 and held at the same time as the Premier's first uprising commemoration on September 9. Therefore, no ceremonies were held in the city yesterday, but in order to commemorate the National Father's steadfast, unyielding, and arduous struggle and his lofty and great personality, citizens from all walks of life mostly used a calm attitude to make a spiritual commemoration. It is also at a time of extraordinary circumstances, the European war is expanding, and those who attempt to undermine the war of resistance and endanger the nation have a similar environment to that of the National Father's martyrdom eighteen years ago. Therefore, in order to overcome hardships and overcome difficulties, we must unanimously emulate the National Father's great spirit and, under the leadership of the President, pledge to firmly believe in, support national policies, strive for final victory, and complete the great undertaking of national construction.

### Father Jacquinot Grieves for National Tribulations; Quietly Boards a Ship to Leave Shanghai; Reluctantly Bids Farewell to the Nanshi Refugee Zone; Hastens Back to France to Dedicate Himself to Comforting Refugees; He Longs for People in Shanghai to Treat the Departure Area Well

Father Jacquinot de Besange, the person in charge of the Nanshi Refugee Zone, suddenly boarded a ship and left Shanghai to return to his country yesterday. Prior to this, no one in various circles knew about it. Even those close to Father Jacquinot did not know that Father Jacquinot had suddenly left. Because yesterday morning Father Jacquinot was still holding mass at the Catholic Church, after a reporter from the Social News Agency learned the news that Father Jacquinot was about to return to his country, they rushed to catch up and saw this white-haired, kind, and amiable French elder. He told them the distress of suddenly leaving Shanghai to return to his country and made a brief talk at the pier.

Missing the Motherland

According to the conversation, the unfortunate fall of Paris and the retreat of the French army and the fleeing of compatriots from the motherland, how can I not be moved? After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, I have repeatedly seen the pain suffered by the Chinese people and the tragedy of families being destroyed and people being killed. Therefore, I have to reluctantly leave this second hometown and hasten back to my country, temporarily bidding farewell to tens of thousands of beloved refugees in Nanshi. This trip will take the route of North America and then return to the country. I will still devote myself to comforting the refugees. After returning to the Nanshi refugee area, a follow-up committee has now been organized to take charge. Although the number of refugees in the current refugee area has decreased, the funding is still extremely tight. Therefore, it is planned to disperse the young and strong. The survey has been completed.

Concern for the Refugees

We are waiting to discuss the schedule for sending them away. Now it has been decided to issue half a month's rations to each person to temporarily maintain them. After that, they can only make a living on their own. It has also been agreed to provide for the elderly and weak in the Xin Pu Yu Hall. I did not want to ignore the lives of tens of thousands of refugees and suddenly leave, and I could not bear to abandon the hard-earned refugee area without completing the task. It is because the flames of war in the motherland burn in my heart. I hope everyone will appreciate this. What I hope is that the Nanshi refugee area can continue to exist. There are no shortage of philanthropists in Shanghai who will continue to treat it well and provide assistance and relief. Then, even though I am in Western Europe, my heart will be comforted. He couldn't help but sob, and the reporter was also silent.

French僑s' Impressions

According to the French Shanghai Daily, the French residents of this port knew several days ago that the fall of Paris was inevitable, but they still had a glimmer of hope. When the death knell of the fall finally rang, it suddenly made the French residents recall this beautiful capital, all of which they had passed or strolled through, and they all felt deeply saddened. It is noted that the fall of Paris this time is especially reminiscent of the situation when the German army entered Paris on March 1, 1871. The French Shanghai Daily stopped its commentary for a day yesterday to express its condolences for the loss of Paris.

Chinese Staff Contribute Funds

The Chinese staff of the French Concession Board of Directors donated large sums of money to fund French operations. It is recorded that the Chinese staff of the French Concession Fire Brigade donated 562 yuan, 8 jiao, and 2 fen; more than 10 public works staff on Xue Huali Road donated 127 yuan; the Chinese staff of the French Concession Board of Directors General Office and Printing Room donated 250 yuan; the purchasing staff and tax offices and financial office of the French Concession Board of Directors donated 1,000 yuan; and the Chinese staff of the French Concession Classified Business Office donated 57 yuan, 4 jiao, and 1 fen.

British Send Money

The British War Fund Raising Committee in this city held a meeting on the 14th at the committee's office at No. 27 The Bund. British Consul Layber, Atkinson, Burras, Bowden, Woodhead, Sir Marshall, Dr. Kennett, and the committee's chief accountant Stitcher and secretary Crawford were all present at the meeting. Burras resigned from his position as a fundraising committee member due to his imminent departure. Crawford

Volunteered

, Willing to succeed him, and was approved by the General Assembly. Then, the committee's chief accountant Stitcher announced the total amount of donations. As of the 13th of this month, a total of 858,116 yuan, 8 jiao, and 6 fen in French currency and 15,601.1 pounds in British currency had been received. It was also announced that the funds donated in the past six months had been remitted back to the motherland to be used as funds for the British Red Cross, comforting soldiers, and the Navy. its

Distribution Situation

The following: 3,300 pounds were used for the British Red Cross, and 6 ambulances for wounded soldiers were designated to be purchased. 3,200 pounds were used for comforting soldiers, and 500 pounds were used for the Navy. According to the committee, there is still a great shortage of ambulances at the front line, and each ambulance costs 550 pounds. Therefore, it is hoped that the British in this port will continue to donate enthusiastically to help the motherland in the war.

### Dishonest Pricing of Goods; Written Warning Issued; Rice Price Rise Is Surprisingly Alarming

The continuous rise in prices in this port is a serious problem for society and people's livelihoods. The majority of wage earners cannot even afford to feed their families with their hard-earned wages. As a result, strikes are spreading and theft cases are increasing, which is a cause for deep concern for the future of security in the concession. A reporter from Pingming News has learned from reliable sources that the Public Works Department is very concerned about the price issue in the concession. Recently, a large number of people from the department's health department have been sent to first investigate the cost of various necessities and the sales price of the stores to see if it exceeds their

Entitled Profits

In addition, those who are not truthful in pricing, or who have not fully marked the prices of the goods, have been warned by the Public Works Department, followed by fines. The department does not want to publish the business names and companies that have been issued written warnings, but it is heard that a certain large department store has been fined, and another large department store is also on the list of written warnings. Rice is the main food item for the people of this port. Since this month, its price has been

Continuous Rise

At first, they used the excuse of a prolonged drought to arbitrarily raise the price. However, after the rain, not only did it not fall, but it rose by as much as two yuan on the 15th, which is unreasonable. If it is because of strong exports, the rice stored in this port has not been exported, and the thickness of the stock

In the Hands of Rice Merchants

There are more than one million bags. Private hoarding and business houses, factories, and economically well-off families all have savings in advance, and the number is even more considerable. Recently, 300,000 bags of foreign rice have been newly ordered. There is no reason to raise the price. The motive is clearly manipulation. The general residents deeply hope that the authorities of the two concessions will, for the sake of future security, immediately promulgate effective measures and strictly implement them. According to concerned

Livelihood Issues

According to economists, in February of this year, the Public Security Office of the Public Concession detained dozens of cases of merchants who violated price limits. Soon after, the rice price immediately had a good impact. That is, after the authorities announced the pricing issue this time, most merchants watched. Since then, after continuous detention, the industry pricing on the market in this city has become widespread. Therefore, if you want to suppress and flatten prices at present, you should not only promulgate measures, but also

Effectively Prosecute

It can get better results. On the one hand, the price of rice in the stacks is limited to be sold, the time and quantity of the ordinary light are expanded, the group purchase of rice is supervised, and the types of goods, transaction prices, and selling prices are strictly marked, which can be effective. As for the expansion of the European war, it has nothing to do with foreign rice. In addition, foreign exchange has continued to ease recently. All rice merchants have sent telegrams to foreign countries to order a large amount of tribute rice, which has been continuously transported to Shanghai for storage.

### Suggestions from the Shaoxiao Relief Association: Procurement of Jiangxi Rice; Affordable and Close, Sufficient for Emergency Relief; Additional Export Surtax Decided in Ningbo

The Executive Committee of the Shaoxiao Public Food Relief Association, in order to actively carry out relief for the rice shortage in their homeland, held a meeting at 3 PM yesterday at the association's location on Love Lane. They resolved the following: (1) Change the association's name to the Shaoxing Seven Counties Sojourners in Shanghai Shaoxiao Relief Association; (2) Request the Sojourners Association to telegraph the authorities to appeal for the unblocking of rice sources; (3) The "Price Stabilization Committee" in the articles of association passed at yesterday's general meeting will be renamed the Disaster Relief Committee, and the committee members are requested to actively solicit donations. The telegram from the association to the authorities via the Sojourners Association is as follows:

Request to Purchase Native Rice

Regarding the rapidly rising rice prices in Shaoxiao since the beginning of summer, reaching a peak of 120 yuan per stone, the situation is extremely dire. Impoverished people are exchanging children for food, and even digging up grass roots and tree bark, but these are also nearly exhausted, causing immense panic. The underlying cause is the lack of rice sources. If we purchase foreign rice, the price is too high and transportation is even more difficult. Even if it reaches the disaster area, it will still cost no less than sixty or seventy yuan, which offers no benefit to the impoverished. Sojourners in Shanghai recently convened a meeting and unanimously agreed that if Jiangxi rice could be procured, it would be affordable and close, quickly alleviating the crisis. This is a fundamental solution. We respectfully request that you forward this situation on our behalf to President Chiang Kai-shek, the Council of the Executive Yuan, representatives from Zhejiang Province in the National Assembly, the Zhejiang Provincial Assembly, and Chairman Wang Boqun of your association, to appeal for relief. This matter concerns public food, and we respectfully request your utmost assistance.

Shanghai Rice Arrives in Dinghai

According to visitors from Dinghai, the food panic in Dinghai has slightly eased. Rice arriving from Shanghai in recent days includes 250 packages purchased privately, weighing over 44,700 catties, and 400 packages of Rong salt for transportation, weighing over 79,400 catties. It is reported that public sales are still being held in the city. However, due to the small amount of rice in stock, it is temporarily not being distributed to stores for sale. Natives of Shiqi Town in Ningbo have initiated fundraising to manage price stabilization. Since the launch, donations have been very enthusiastic. Over 10,000 yuan has already been raised. The list of donations is not included here.

Deadline for Ningbo Donation

The Ningbo Sojourners Association in Shanghai telegraphed Commissioner Xu of the Sixth District of Ningbo and Magistrate Yu of Yu County, requesting the suspension of the export permit surtax for relief funds. It has now been learned that a reply has been sent to Shanghai, and this request has not been approved. Furthermore, the Ningbo Sojourners Association in Shanghai has scheduled a second donation drive for this month on the 12th at 2 PM at the Yu Qiaqing Road clubhouse to discuss various important proposals. The target donation amount of one million yuan must be paid in full by the 22nd. It is reported that those pledging donations in recent days have been quite enthusiastic.

Yuyao Disaster Severe; Appeal for Donations

The rice shortage in Yuyao, thanks to the strong assistance of Yu Qiaqing and Pan Jiufen in Shanghai, is less severe than in Shaoxing. However, the drought has been prolonged, and the disaster is widespread. The situation is twice as severe. In addition to continuing to entrust Mr. Yu to purchase foreign rice for relief, Shi Shufan, Zhou Weizhen, and Ye Erqi, and others from Yuyao who have come to Shanghai, are appealing to leaders of the Yuyao community in Shanghai to launch a donation drive for disaster relief. The general idea is as follows: "The famine in Yuyao has fortunately been greatly aided by Yu Qiaqing, and the various fellow villagers in Shanghai have generously raised funds, enabling the continuous purchase and transportation of foreign rice to overcome this difficult situation. The people of Yuyao are deeply grateful. However, the famine in the countryside has initially decreased, but the disaster has become even worse. Until recently, more than half of the rice crops in both upland and lowland fields have withered and died. The remaining 40-50% cannot be planted due to the cracked earth. It is certain that the autumn harvest will be hopeless. Based on this, the lives of tens of thousands of people may be prolonged for now, but how will they survive in the future? The people's resources are limited, and the ability to purchase will eventually be exhausted. By then, every household will be impoverished, and most will be empty. How can we bear to imagine what will happen? The Yuyao community is launching a fundraising campaign to prepare for famine and provide a last resort. We believe that the community leaders in Shanghai must consider the suffering and the urgency of the situation. When faced with a choice, they will surely be willing to act. We ask you to move from generous loans to donations of grain and assistance, doing what you can and putting your heart into helping our hometown. As for how to proceed to achieve rapid results, we hope that the leaders in Shanghai will plan carefully."

### Jiangyin in Chaos; Dissident Mobile Units Enter the City; Engage in Skirmishes with Japanese Troops

A visitor from Shazhou reported that a Chinese mobile unit in Jiangyin City had a major conflict with Japanese troops the day before yesterday, resulting in casualties on both sides. Afterward, Japanese troops conducted a major search, and hundreds of people were arrested. The situation outside the city is also extremely chaotic. In Xiagang Town, eight miles from the city, the mobile unit exchanged fire with Japanese troops, resulting in several deaths and injuries. The town's houses were burned. Currently, it is the busy season for planting rice seedlings, and the people have fled. The city gates have been tightly closed for three days and have not been opened. Transportation to and from the city has also been cut off.

### Japanese Troops Withdraw from Hongkou; Reason Unknown

In the Hongkou area, where Japanese naval landing forces and military police units are stationed, many military trucks were suddenly used yesterday afternoon to transport the landing forces to Zhabei, Nanshi, and western Shanghai. In the afternoon, more trucks loaded with troops headed west. The troop transport was quite busy. Many military police were also patrolling along various roads, which was noticeably different from the usual state. The purpose of transporting the Japanese troops is not yet known.

### Inheritance Tax to be Implemented Next Month; Simultaneously in Shanghai; No Exceptions for Concession Areas; Collected Like Income Tax

After the inheritance tax regulations and implementing regulations were successively promulgated by the National Government, the Ministry of Finance established a direct tax office, which will be implemented nationwide starting July 1st. The collection of inheritance tax in the Shanghai concession area will not be delayed due to Shanghai becoming an isolated island. Moreover, income tax in the Shanghai concession area is still being collected as usual. Therefore, the collection of inheritance tax in Shanghai is being actively prepared by the Shanghai office of the Income Tax Bureau. It is reported that the inheritance tax regulations stipulate that if a person dies and leaves property within the territory of the Republic of China, inheritance tax must be collected. Citizens of the Republic of China who are domiciled within the territory of the country but have estates abroad are also subject to tax. Estates less than 5,000 yuan are exempt. Article 24 of the original regulations states, "The date and area of implementation of these regulations shall be determined by order." It has now been decided that it will be implemented nationwide from July 1st, without any geographical divisions.

### Motor Vehicles and Other Goods Prohibited from Transport to the South; Shanghai Customs Notice; Export Prohibited

### Japanese Attacked in Manchuria; 14 Dead, 5 Wounded

The Shanghai Times reported from Reuter's Changchun dispatch on June 15th that on the midnight of April 18th, "Sixty bandits suddenly attacked the Japanese community in Mizahe Village (transliteration), northern Manchuria, killing 14 and wounding 5. This news has been censored for a long time and is only approved for publication today."

### Inland Paper Mills Produce Light Blue Newspaper; One-Third the Price; Cultural Circles Advocate Adoption

Since the source of paper has become difficult, many people in society have been using local paper instead of foreign paper to provide relief and protect our rights. Recently, I heard that the inland has created a kind of light blue newspaper, which is made of domestic bamboo leaves and other materials. Its texture is thicker than rough-edged paper, rich in cotton and soft ink absorption, which can replace imported newspapers. The price is as low as one-third. According to people who have come to Shanghai from the mainland, newspapers and publications in the southwestern provinces used to use gray paper as a substitute because of the lack of newspapers, but the paper was rough and hard, not suitable for folding, and its color was dark. The oil ink printing was also very difficult to read. Now, after paper mills in various places have researched and manufactured this kind of newspaper, they feel satisfied under the adoption of various battles. Now it has stopped using gray newspapers and adopted this kind of light blue newspaper. According to a reporter who is familiar with the paper industry, the producing areas of foreign countries are in Europe: Norway, Sweden, Finland, paper, Czech Republic, Germany, and other countries in North America: Canada. However, since the expansion of the European war, European freight has become more difficult day by day, and Canada has also stepped up military production due to the European war, and the paper-making sector has been significantly affected. Recently, the American fleet has increased freight rates by 50%. Therefore, although it can be transported from Canada, the price is difficult to fall sharply. It is hoped that business, industry, culture, and printing will jointly promote the cultivation of national power by using scholars’ paper and seek self-sufficiency. It must not be trivial to benefit the national economy and the people's livelihood.

### Public Concession Trams Increase Fares Again; Effective from the 17th; First-Class Minimum Fare is Five Cents

The Shanghai Public Concession Tramway Company will increase fares again starting today (17th). The company has posted notices and new fare schedules in each tram, stipulating that the minimum fare for first class is 5 national currency and 4 cents for third class.

### Japanese Fear Guerrillas; Prohibit Farmers from Planting Rice and Wheat; Only Allow Planting Vegetables of One Foot High; Future Life of Farmers Becomes More Tragic

The Mainland News reports that the Japanese authorities have recently prohibited farmers from planting rice and wheat along the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou railway lines, because when rice and wheat grow, guerrillas use them to hide and emerge. However, this does not mean that the fields will be allowed to lie barren. Farmers may now plant vegetables or other plants that do not exceed one foot in height.

### Westerners Unable to Obtain Drafts; Stop Going to Japan for Summer; Japanese Economic Commissioner Greatly Criticized; Accused of Small Tricks and Lack of Integrity

The North-China Daily News yesterday published a letter from a reader signed "Old Tourist," stating, "I have something to say for the readers who intend to go to Japan for vacation in your newspaper, that is, the Japanese Economic Commissioner in Yokohama Specie Bank in this city refused to issue a permit to purchase yen drafts.

Unable to Follow the Exchange Rate in the City

Tourists are only allowed to carry a small amount of yen to Japan. To carry more than the excess, they have to purchase drafts. Now, they cannot purchase drafts according to the yen exchange rate in this city, and the cost of vacationing in Japan will increase by four times. Because one US dollar is only equal to 4.25 Japanese yen in Japan.

Book Cabin First, Then Buy Draft

A friend of mine, who plans to travel to Japan, encountered difficulties. I will describe it to warn others. On the 14th of this month, my friend visited the office of the Economic Commissioner to inquire whether he and his family could buy drafts for the cost of spending the summer in Japan. The other party replied that he must first show the ship ticket before he can be allowed to buy such drafts.

Ship Ticket Obtained, Draft Not Issued

My friend bought the ship ticket, which costs about 1,000 Japanese yen. The next day, he took the ticket to the commissioner's office again, but he was flatly refused. My friend argued that he would not have bought the ship ticket if he had not received a reply that he could buy a draft. The other party only replied with a cold shrug. My friend had no choice but to withdraw. Now he has to return the ship ticket and suffer a nameless loss. The cost of the vacation is not affordable to my friend if it is calculated according to the exchange rate of 4.25 Japanese yen.

Such Behavior Tarnishes Great Reputation

The commissioner's methods do not seem to be what a responsible Japanese official should do. He has made a promise that he can buy a draft, but he has broken his word, and he has earned the stigma of being untrustworthy and playing petty tricks. Any country that values reputation will not allow its officials to act in this way. If it had been made clear in advance that the draft could not be purchased, no one would have any complaints, but they would have made other plans for their vacations based on this.

### Paint Worker Strike Expands; Police Watch Closely; Three More Shops Smashed Yesterday; Police Car Arrived to Suppress

The labor strike of more than 7,000 paint workers in the city has been expanding since a group of workers smashed Xu Fa Ji Paint Shop the day before yesterday afternoon, and negotiations were interrupted. As of last night, there have been more than a dozen cases of workers harassing paint shops. As a result, most paint shops have been closed and posted notices stating, "Workers are rioting, business is temporarily suspended." The details are as follows:

Forced to Sign

At about 6:30 yesterday morning, over 30 striking workers suddenly arrived at Tan You Ji Paint Shop at No. 850, North Chengdu Road, Public Concession, and smashed the shop's tables, chairs, paint buckets, and signs. After hearing the news, the police officers in charge sent police to suppress the riot in a police car, and two people were arrested on the spot. At about 10:00 yesterday morning, the Dongfeifuxing Paint Shop on Barker Road and at about 11:00 am yesterday morning, the Shao Tingji Paint Shop on Mcgregor Road also had similar events. Also, at about 10:00 pm the night before yesterday, more than 20 workers came to Yu Xinfu Paint Shop at No. 1429, Rue Edward VII, and forced the shop owner to sign a contract, increasing the workers' wages to 2 yuan per day.

Negotiations Interrupted

Also, it is learned that the police authorities, because it concerns public safety, have already notified eight labor representatives, including Lu Shoufu, Zhou Hesheng, and Wang Zhongyuan, to report what they know about the workers who participated in the harassment of the paint shops. As for the five representatives of the employers, including Xu Gongpei and Sun Rui, they all resigned from their positions as representatives yesterday as a precaution. Therefore, it is difficult for the two sides to negotiate again for a while. However, with the efforts of the Public Works Department to mediate, it is not difficult to resolve it soon. The number of arrested paint workers yesterday was at least about ten. The police also returned the paint tools and objects confiscated from the workers to the industry association on Rue Edward VII. It is said that the association has decided to petition the Political Department of the Public Works Department today to request protection.

### Nantong Japanese Ships Investigation

According to an investigation, the small steamers sailing in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River and directly affiliated to the "Asia Shipping Company", taking Nantong as an example, include Nantong Maru, Heda Maru, Changsheng Maru, Hongli Maru, Sakura Maru, Sakura Maru, Koushou Maru, 23 Ebisu Maru, 52 Ebisu Maru, Dayun Express Ship, and China Country Express Transport, a total of eleven ships.

### US Ship Luzon Moored Alone at Pontoon

The US Yangtze River gunboats Luzon and Oahu sailed up the Yangtze River two weeks ago for inspection, and returned to Shanghai on the 14th to strengthen defenses, and were moored at the Bund outside the French Concession. The public believed that it would be moved to the opposite side of the Yangshupu Shipyard, but a reporter from Xin Sheng She learned that except for the Luzon, which was moored at the US Navy pontoon yesterday, the Oahu is still moored at the Bund outside the French Concession, and it is said that it will stay there for many days.

### Former Wu Hua Bank Manager Wu Yi Suddenly Shot and Killed; Three Shots Hit; Murderer Captured on the Spot; Police Investigating the Cause of Death

A shooting occurred at Fulu Street, French Concession, at about 2:20 pm yesterday. The victim was Wu Yi from Hangzhou, who was shot three times in the chest and fell unconscious. The murderer, one person, was surrounded and captured by passers-by on the spot and taken to the Lujiawan General Police Station. The details are as follows:

Taking Child to See Doctor

Wu Yi, 43 years old, is from Hangzhou, Zhejiang. He lives in a single-family shikumen at No. 166 Fulu Street, French Concession. At about 2:20 pm yesterday, Wu wore a light yellow suit, yellow leather shoes, and ordered a maid to hold his young child of about two years old, intending to accompany him to a doctor's office to treat his child. As he was about to step into his own car (license plate number 1760), because Zhuo was parked at the door of No. 160 next door, Sun Asi (36 years old, from Yancheng), the driver of the car, was starting the engine.

Suddenly Shot

Unexpectedly, a murderer, wearing a light gray gown, was lying in ambush on the side of the road. Seeing Wu approaching, he drew a gun and shot at him, firing three shots, all hitting the chest. Blood gurgled out. The perpetrator tried to discard his weapon and flee east, but fortunately, a crowd of passers-by gathered and captured him on the spot, confiscating a loaded pistol. The police were called and he was taken to the Lujiawan General Police Station for investigation. The suspect is about 30 years old and speaks a local dialect. At that time, after being shot, Wu ran home with his injuries. When he reached the door, his son, Zhongtao, suddenly heard the gunshots and went out to investigate. Seeing his father covered in blood, he almost fell to the ground, so he stepped forward to help him.

Seriously Injured and Died

At this time, Wu was unconscious and his complexion was pale. He was transported to Guangci Hospital for treatment in his own car with license plate number 1760. Because the injuries were in vital areas, he died before reaching the hospital. After a doctor examined him, the body was transferred to the autopsy room on Tairakan Road, waiting for the court to inspect the body today. According to his son, Zhongtao, in early May, the family received a threatening letter, the content of which roughly said that there was no need to form such a feud in the wind and moon field, and the tone contained a strong sourness. My father has been in the business world, and he often frequents brothels and dance halls. After my mother and others persuaded him to go less often to avoid being targeted, he has been living a simple life. It is really strange that he has suffered this unexpected event.

Poor Business

According to Wu, he graduated from Zhijiang University in Hangzhou in his early years, married a wife surnamed Shen, and is 43 years old. He has seven children. The eldest daughter, Mei Yun, is 19 years old and has not yet been engaged. The second son, Zhong Tao, is 16 years old and studying at Zhendan University Junior High School 2. The third son, Zhong Yuan, is 14 years old and is in the sixth grade of Chinese Elementary School. The fourth son, Zhong Yi, is 12 years old and is in the fourth grade of Weiyu Elementary School. The remaining three children are all young. Wu used to be the manager of Wuhua Bank and the Chinese manager of Italian Bank. After resigning, he founded Yi Ji Company, which was later reorganized into Zhongyuan Trading Company. However, due to poor business, it was closed two months ago.

### Pitiful Prostitute; Dies of Poisoning Without a Coffin; Wicked Brothel Owner Detained for Interrogation

Xiao Xiuying, an 18-year-old woman from Tongzhou, was a prostitute in a brothel opened by Wang Zhangshi from Yangzhou at No. 4, Old Hueilie Lane, Yunnan Road, Public Concession. She was usually beaten and forced to prostitute herself every night by the brothel owner, resulting in the development of syphilis. The brothel owner not only did not treat Xiao Xiuying but continued to force her to receive guests as before. Xiao Xiuying did not dare to disobey under the beatings. The syphilis she suffered from became more and more severe. According to her prostitute sisters, they often heard Xiao Xiuying sobbing quietly when night was quiet. I waited for it to shed tears of sympathy, and there was nothing more tragic than this in the world. Unexpectedly, Xiao Xiuying died of poisoning yesterday morning. The inhumane brothel owner Wang Zhangshi did not buy a coffin because of the high price of coffins recently. She only managed to buy a large wooden box containing Golden Mouse brand cigarettes nearby. She stuffed Xiao Xiuying's body into the box, nailed the lid, and moved the box next to the garbage can in the lane at 2:20 pm. Later, a Chinese policeman caught a glimpse of it and found it suspicious. He opened the box and discovered it. He immediately reported the matter to the police station. The police went to investigate and detained the brothel owner Wang Zhangshi and sent her to the Special District Court for legal action.

### Tragedy at Yue Opera Theater; One Woman Dies

At 8:30 PM the day before yesterday, at the Longyuan Shaoxing Opera Theater on the top floor of the Tianlai Pool Bathhouse at No. 1, Xinmin Lane, No. 41, North Zhujia Bridge, Arraig Road, French Concession, while a drama was being performed on stage, an electric fan exploded with sparks due to a short circuit. A waiter saw it and reported it to the cashier. So they closed the main door to prevent a fire. Then the theater suddenly became dark, causing more than a hundred spectators to panic. They rushed to escape in the darkness, desperately running down the front and back stairs, causing many people to be knocked down and trampled. After the police were informed, they immediately dispatched a large number of detectives to the scene and sent the injured to the hospital for treatment. As recorded in yesterday's newspaper, it is now learned that Shen Wu, the wife of Shen Jinfu (a former detective in the French police station), the former owner of the theater, was also watching the opera that night. She was pushed and trampled, resulting in injuries. She was sent to Guangci Hospital. Due to her serious injuries, the treatment was ineffective, and she died at 4:00 am yesterday. The hospital informed the police station to send the mortuary vehicle to the Tongren Fuyuan Funeral Home for a body examination. It will be reported to the court today for an autopsy. It is said that the police station has summoned the owner and staff of the theater for investigation into the cause of the incident and will await for verification before hearing.

### Shanghai West Gambling Dens Finally Close Down; Japanese Military Police Go to Various Venues to Seal Them Off

It was originally planned to close all the gambling dens in western Shanghai on the 15th, but as of yesterday morning, there was no sign of any closure order. Unexpectedly, at 3:20 pm yesterday (16th), the Japanese military police branch in western Shanghai suddenly dispatched a large number of military police. Four people were in a team. They went to various gambling dens, first took down the weapons such as box guns used by the staff, and ordered the gamblers who were gambling to go out and ordered them to stop. Therefore, after 3:30, there were no gambling dens in western Shanghai. It is said that the flower club factory in Yongyuanbang is also included in the closure order. The total number of guns seized from the gambling dens reached more than 300, and about 3,000 to 4,000 rounds of ammunition. However, it is said that although the closure of gambling dens has been realized, they will continue to open soon. This move is only a temporary paragraph, so as to set up a new stove in the future. Let's mark it down.

### Head Beaten to Death; Criminals Arrested; Four Arrested Attempt to Deny

At about 7:00 am on November 15th last year, there was a dispute over a wage increase for workers at the Lu Lin Printing Company at No. 531, Peikai Er Road. The foreman, Feng A Mao from Shaoxing (42 years old), was asked to tell the owner. Feng did not agree. The workers immediately went on strike. At this time, Feng went to his home at No. 375, Kunming Road, to work. He was beaten and injured in vital areas by the workers, resulting in death. The dozen or so perpetrators took the opportunity to escape without a trace and could not be arrested. At 1:30 pm the day before yesterday, Hongkou police detectives Tang Guangfu, Xu Kaitai, and Li Zunzhi received confidential information, saying that the key criminals in the case, Hu Akang and Wang Songhe from Ningbo, and Ding Xingtang and Que Peikuan from Jiangbei, were hiding at No. 2 and No. 11, Tongyi Lane, Peikai Er Road. They reported to the police chief, and together with the Western Detective rushed to the address and arrested Hu and the other four. They were sent to the Special Court yesterday.

Police lawyer Jiang Baolian prosecuted him for abuse, explained the case, requested investigation, and said that Xu did not want to work in Chen's store again, but his family was not in Shanghai, so he asked him to be temporarily sent to the Chinese Children's Welfare Association for custody. Then, Xu Xiaohai said that because he slept less at night, he dozed off while making clothes. At first, he was beaten with a ruler, and then he was burned on both arms with an iron. Judge Jiang Shuzi inspected Xu's scars and questioned the defendant. Chen's confession was vague. Chen Shaoyun was sentenced to three months in prison as a warning. Xu Xiaohai was allowed to be temporarily sent to the Chinese Children's Welfare Association for custody.

### Lingnan University's Agricultural College to Move to Pingshi in July

(Hong Kong Correspondence) After the fall of Guangzhou, Lingnan University in Guangzhou moved to Hong Kong to continue classes at the University of Hong Kong. At the beginning of spring, the Ministry of Education ordered an inland relocation. The school decided to relocate the Agricultural College first. Some time ago, the Dean of the College, Gu Guifen, was dispatched back to Guangdong to select a site for the college. It was decided to move to Pingshi in Lechang, because the land there is fertile enough to develop agriculture. The school has been very busy lately preparing for the relocation. It will take advantage of the summer vacation in early July to transport the equipment in batches. The Guangdong Provincial Government will provide a one-time subsidy of 50,000 yuan for the relocation expenses. Chairman Li Hanhun sent a telegram to the President of the school, Li Yinglin, which said: "I have learned that your school's agricultural college is moving inland. I admire your dedication to cultivating agricultural and forestry talents and developing agriculture. Regarding the relocation expenses, the provincial government has decided to provide a one-time subsidy of 50,000 yuan to help with the relocation. As tax revenues are decreasing daily and the treasury is empty, we are unable to provide regular expenses. We sincerely hope that the college will move inland and open classes as soon as possible to meet the eager expectations." In addition, the affiliated middle school of the school previously ordered a batch of various instruments from the United States, which have arrived in Hong Kong, with a value of several thousand Hong Kong dollars.

Zhenjiang Normal School. Jiangsu Provincial Zhenjiang Normal School at 1, Lane 363, Ningbo Road, this city, is extremely conscientious in its teaching, so the number of students is increasing day by day. After the summer vacation, in addition to restoring the senior high school normal school course, it will specially add a one-year simplified normal school course and a senior high school general course, each with one class, and set up free scholarship quotas to encourage students.

### Next Season's Basketball Game. The Baskets Will Be Raised Two Feet. Height Will Be Increased From Ten Feet to Twelve Feet. Decision to Trial By the American Basketball Rules Committee

The height of the basketball basket in the current basketball game is only ten feet from the ground, which is extremely convenient for basketball players who are "as tall as the sky" to shoot baskets. It causes the team with shorter players to fail not because they are technically inferior to others, but because they are at a great disadvantage in terms of player height. Therefore, the American Basketball Rules Committee (National Basketball Rules Committee) has decided to try raising the height of the basket by two feet, for a total height of twelve feet, starting next season. It has been tested by Coach Art Edmundson of the University of Washington. Player Shilling, who is six feet four inches tall, tried to shoot under the old system basket, which was ten feet high, and it was almost casually dropped in, very easy. Another player, McDonald, who is six feet five inches tall, tested under the new system basket, which was twelve feet high, and it was determined that he could not use his height to obtain unexpected gains without relying on his well-trained skills. Therefore, based on the results of this test, the American Basketball Rules Committee decided to implement it on a trial basis starting next season, 1940-41. However, it is only a general trial nature. If no obstacles occur, the rules will be revised to be universally used. According to the United States, there are many players who are more than six feet five inches tall, so the unexpected gains without skills have long been deeply noted by the basketball community. For example, the means by which Ryan, the tall man of the former Shanghai Pirates team, casually put the ball into the basket, deeply threatened the shorter Chinese. If the basket is raised, the tall man will have no use for his extra convenience except to gain an advantage in the jump ball, and he will have to be judged on the merits of his skills with the shorter players to determine the difference between more and less.

### Racecourse Fellow Club.  Flat Target Shooting Awards. Zheng Jiyi, Champion of Group A. Li Kaiyuan, Champion of Group B

The Shanghai Racecourse Fellow Club members held a flat target shooting competition. This year's participants were more numerous than in previous years, with nineteen members in Group A and seventeen members in Group B. In addition, in order to increase interest, a doubles flat target shooting competition was also held, with eight groups participating. The Group A and B competitions adopted a double elimination system, while the doubles competition adopted a single elimination system. After the competition started on the 16th of last month, it ended successfully after a month of fierce battles. Zheng Jiyi was the champion of Group A, Sun Jianqu was the runner-up, and Wu Shude was the third place. Li Kaiyuan was the champion of Group B, Hong Xiefan was the runner-up, and Chen Lingsheng was the third place. Li Kaiyuan won the highest record for consecutive hits calculated according to the flat target points. Double happiness came to the door, which was really not a coincidence. The awards ceremony and dinner party were held last night, with more than eighty participants. The atmosphere was lively and extraordinary. Before the event, the champions of Group A and B were invited to hold a friendly performance match. Halfway through the dinner, the club's Chairman Hong and Miss Bu Ying presented the awards. The champions, runners-up, and third-place winners of Group A and B each received a silver cup. Among them, the champion of Group A was donated by Gu Zhengxiang, the third place winner of Group A and the highest "Black" winner were donated by Zheng Jiyi, and the third place winner of Group B was donated by Jin Rongzong and Lu Xiwu. The doubles champion was donated by Gu Dingyu, and the rest were awarded by the club. There were a total of eleven awards, shining with silver light, which was a grand sight. The excitement was unprecedented.

### Launching a Universal Savings Campaign for Overseas Chinese

— Xu Ruilin

Raising 250 million yuan to Support National Construction

Editor's Note: The original text of this article is very detailed. It elaborates on the theory of resistance and national construction, provides detailed descriptions of the patriotic movements of overseas Chinese, and explains each estimate and suggestion exhaustively. However, due to the limited space of this publication, only the main points are excerpted. The introduction and conclusion have also been omitted. We hope the original author will understand!

Estimation of the Economic Power of Overseas Chinese

Materials about overseas Chinese are quite scarce, making it difficult to accurately assess their economic power. However, common sense is the beginning of science. Based on common sense and combined with measurements from different perspectives, it is possible to approach the heart of the matter.

A. Observing from the Perspective of Population: According to the Nanyang Jian, the total overseas Chinese population, excluding over two million overseas-born Chinese in Siam, is 4,492,569. According to statistics from the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, there are 330,000 overseas Chinese in North and South America, 45,000 in South Pacific Islands and Australia, 30,000 in European countries, and 612,310 in Hong Kong (pre-war figures). The total number is 7,459,120. According to Mr. Chen Jiageng's recent remarks published in the Hong Kong Ta Kung Pao on March 27, the total number of overseas Chinese reaches 11,000,000. This is still based on pre-war statistics, and the number of overseas Chinese going to Southeast Asia has been increasing daily since the war. In the Philippines alone, the pre-war overseas Chinese population was only 80,000 (according to Nanyang Jian). Now, it is generally believed to be over 120,000, an increase of one-third. Other regions have also seen significant increases. In short, the overseas Chinese population is between 5 million and 12 million. We will tentatively take the lowest number, 5 million, as the basis for our argument.

Assume that the total number of overseas Chinese (or those suitable for our war economy) is 5 million. Based on this number, let's estimate the wealth of the overseas Chinese. As far as we know, most overseas Chinese are productive members, and many have not established families in Southeast Asia. Among the 5 million overseas Chinese, about 1 million are unemployed, and 1 million are unable to produce, including women and children. Producers account for 3 million. If each producer's annual income is 360 Straits dollars, then the annual income of 3 million people is 1.08 billion Straits dollars, equivalent to about 700 billion yuan in national currency.

This is only the income of overseas Chinese, not their capital wealth. If 700 billion yuan is taken as the amount representing 1% annual interest on capital, then the total capital should be 700 trillion yuan. This figure is truly astonishing!

B. Observing from the Perspective of Overseas Chinese Businesses: According to statistics from the Philippine Department of Agriculture and Commerce, overseas Chinese investment in the Philippines is 502,020,313 Philippine pesos, including retail, grain and rice, import and export, textiles, coconut, hemp, tobacco, and other industries. Other investments in real estate and buildings, as well as stocks in banks and foreign companies, are not included. In Manila alone, overseas Chinese-owned buildings are worth over 20 million Philippine pesos. Stocks in banks and foreign companies are also around 20 million. As for land and houses in Cebu, Iloilo, Sandakan, Davao, and provincial capitals in the mountains, they are worth no less than 50 million Philippine pesos. Combining the Philippine Department of Agriculture and Commerce's statistics, the total overseas Chinese investment in the Philippines is at least 600 million Philippine pesos.

The Philippines, with only 120,000 overseas Chinese, has a total investment of as much as 600 million Philippine pesos. Assuming that the investment per overseas Chinese in other parts of Southeast Asia is equal to 30% of the investment of overseas Chinese in the Philippines, then excluding the 120,000 people in the Philippines (assuming a total overseas Chinese population of 5 million), the total investment of the remaining 4.88 million people would be 732 million Philippine pesos. Adding the 600 million pesos from the Philippines, the total is 800.2 million Philippine pesos, equivalent to over 5.6 trillion yuan in national currency. And this doesn’t include the labor capital of Chinese people.

C. Observing from the Perspective of Annual Remittances: According to authoritative statistics, between 1931 and 1935, overseas Chinese remittances ranged from a high of 412,200,000 yuan to a low of 123,800,000 yuan, averaging 332,038,000 yuan. This was during the global economic depression, and remittances were undoubtedly affected. At that time, the foreign exchange rate in China was also above 1 shilling and 5 pence, three times higher than the current black market rate of around 4 pence. Assuming that the current remittance value is the same as before, then the current annual remittances from overseas Chinese are at least around 700 billion yuan in national currency. Assuming that two-thirds of the 3 million productive overseas Chinese members need to remit money back home, and assuming that each person's remittance is one-fifth of their total annual income (360 Straits dollars), it can be inferred that the annual income of overseas Chinese is 525 billion yuan in national currency. Assuming that this is capital yielding 1% annual interest, then this capital is 525 trillion yuan.

From the above, the wealth of overseas Chinese, estimated by population, is 700 trillion yuan in national currency; estimated by business investment, it is 560 trillion yuan; and estimated by remittances, it is 525 trillion yuan. In other words, the wealth of overseas Chinese is between 525 trillion and 700 trillion yuan. For the convenience of calculation, assume that the total wealth of overseas Chinese is 500 trillion yuan, generating 50 trillion yuan in annual interest. If overseas Chinese can lend one-tenth of their annual income to the country as a fund to balance foreign exchange, the country would have an additional 50 billion yuan in income each year; if they can contribute 2%, it would be 100 billion yuan. This is indeed an astonishing amount of money!

The Donation Movement of the Past Three Years

The patriotic enthusiasm shown by overseas Chinese in the past three years of the war of resistance is highly commendable. The first thing to point out is the universality of this patriotic enthusiasm; regardless of social class, organization, men, women, old, young, wise, foolish, rich, or poor, all have risen up together!

The patriotism of overseas Chinese youth is unparalleled. Not only do they organize groups and hold meetings locally to promote various war-related activities, but countless young people also leave their parents, siblings, professions, and inheritances behind to return to China and work as drivers, orderlies, and nurses. For the survival of their homeland, they are ready to sacrifice their lives at any time.

Overseas Chinese merchants treat the slogan of boycotting inferior goods as an order to be executed. In their vocabulary, there is no difference between unscrupulous merchants and traitors.

Their donations to the homeland have become an unprecedented and enthusiastic movement. According to various statistics, overseas Chinese have donated over 250 million yuan to the war of resistance in the past three years. It comes in several forms: purchasing government bonds, direct donations, or monthly pledges. Once the money is given, they do not think about getting it back. Although this amount is only enough for the country's war expenses for a little over a month, it is the crystallization of vast enthusiasm, and the country should accept it as 250 million hearts!

However, as a matter of reflection, we must also raise a question: have overseas Chinese fully demonstrated their strength?

If the financial resources of overseas Chinese are only enough to bear a donation of 250 million yuan, and any further burden would risk bankruptcy, then the government has received funds approaching this insurance line. In that case, the obligations of overseas Chinese can be considered fulfilled!

If the country's needs are not great, and the donations from overseas Chinese have exceeded those of all other compatriots, then it would be inappropriate to ask more from them.

If the country's other foreign exchange resources are already surplus, then the overseas Chinese sharing this huge war expense of 250 million yuan would be able to report to the homeland without regret!

However, the country currently faces needs that are ten times greater than 250 million yuan, and there is no easier or less harmful way to raise this amount. The economic capacity of overseas Chinese is not only not exhausted by 250 million yuan, but according to the previous estimates, there is a reserve that is ten to a hundred times greater than 250 million yuan. Therefore, we cannot help but say somewhat harshly: in the past three years of the war of resistance, overseas Chinese have not fully exerted their strength, nor have they completely fulfilled their due obligations. The donation of 250 million yuan, viewed as the contribution of 250 million hearts, is indeed a valuable gift. Viewed as the country's need, it is only equal to a little over a month of war expenses. Therefore, we must call for the financial strength and heart of overseas Chinese to correspond, and even more so for the economy of overseas Chinese to meet the needs of the homeland!

Long-Term Savings to Meet Long-Term War and National Construction

According to the previous estimates, the wealth of overseas Chinese abroad is between 500 trillion and 700 trillion yuan, with an annual income of 50 trillion to 70 trillion yuan. At this critical moment of national life and death, overseas Chinese have donated only 250 million yuan after three whole years of effort, less than 2% of their income in the past three years. What is the reason for this?

The enthusiasm of overseas Chinese is unparalleled, and the leadership of overseas Chinese leaders is also beyond reproach. The reason why the achievements of the past three years have not kept up with the needs of the homeland is clearly not a matter of enthusiasm, but because many effective methods have not been adopted. One method that particularly deserves our mention is the savings movement that we are currently promoting.

Saving is one of the methods of accumulating wealth, because it is an easy way to turn small amounts into large amounts and concentrate capital invisibly. Therefore, it is widely adopted by countries around the world. Britain, known as the richest country in the world, began advocating "savings instead of donations" when the Second European War broke out. Although Japan has a relatively concentrated capital base, its economic foundation has been shaken after massive consumption. It has recently implemented forced public savings in an attempt to reverse the situation. China is an economically backward country, and the accumulation of national capital is inherently weak. Among the 450 million people in China, very few can come up with a large sum of money. It is already difficult to engage in construction in peacetime. Today, it is even more difficult to step up domestic production to meet the demands of resistance and national construction. The only way to remedy this shortcoming is to encourage people to practice thrift and save universally.

Overseas Chinese are the most capable employees of saving in the entire country. If each person saves an average of two Straits dollars per month, 5 million people can concentrate 120 million Straits dollars in a year, which is equivalent to over 700 billion yuan in national currency at the current exchange rate. It is not difficult for overseas Chinese themselves to save two Straits dollars per month, but the accumulated funds are quite considerable. If all the funds saved up are lent to the government, a large part of the economic problems of the war of resistance would be solved!

Saving is a long-term economic activity. Unlike donations, which cannot be increased beyond a certain limit, saving becomes more powerful and widespread as it progresses. If the funds saved are used to lend to the government, then this economic activity can be said to be a constant donation activity. We are facing a long-term war, so we need a constant long-term donation to strengthen our national power.

Donating money to the country is a matter of course, but human psychology is contradictory: it is not completely selfish, but it cannot be completely public either. As an individual, one cannot help but think of oneself; as a society, everyone must take into account the interests of the public. The development of personality and the progress of society go hand in hand in this contradiction. Donating to save the country certainly does not determine personal interests, because the stronger the country, the more individuals will receive from the country. However, this calculation is ultimately complex and cannot clearly adapt to the contradictions of human psychology. If donations are treated as savings, and the saved funds are used as capital for financial institutions to benefit the people, and then the funds are lent to the country, this is public use of private funds. The benefits to the country are no less than donations, and for the people who contribute the money, it is a reliable investment. Public and private interests are discussed together. This is the unification of contradictions in human psychology and a worldly encouragement for the general public who contribute money.

Capital concentrated through savings will not have the risk of profits being privately monopolized, even if it is used in monopolistic industries. Because the owner of this capital is a large group of common people, and all profits will ultimately belong to the public. Furthermore, this is capital concentrated for the purpose of saving the country. Its first step is to benefit the country, and the country will not only give it absolute protection but also generous benefits. At a time when the entire country is working hard to encourage production and construction, the profits that this capital can obtain will exceed any investment in the world market. Because this loan is targeted at the entire country, its guarantee is more reliable than any bank. With the country's vast resources as the investment scope, its profits are beyond what other businesses can compare. This kind of investment takes both public and private interests into account. Saving the country is saving oneself, and obligation is right. The meaning is clear and unambiguous. With the enthusiasm of overseas Chinese to protect their homeland, this movement will surely be widely responded to. If our expectations come true, then the war expenses that the country can obtain from overseas Chinese each year will not be the mere 250 million yuan in three years, but a huge amount of 50 billion to 70 billion yuan each year. As long as the war of resistance does not end, this savings movement will not stop. For the country, the financial resources will flow endlessly, and for the overseas Chinese, the capital will accumulate more and more. Once victory arrives, using this capital to develop domestic industries will make a contribution to the plan of building the country that cannot be described with numbers!

But this is a principle recommendation. To make it a universal movement, an agency is still needed to promote it. Therefore, we suggest organizing a silver company to handle this matter. Let's assume its name is the Overseas Chinese Savings Lending and Construction Silver Company.

Organizing the Overseas Chinese Savings Lending and Construction Silver Company

The Overseas Chinese Savings Lending and Construction Silver Company aims to concentrate savings, lend to the government, strengthen the war economy, and participate in post-war construction. The company's capital is based on overseas Chinese savings. Assuming that 3 million overseas Chinese are able to participate in savings, with an average of two Straits dollars saved per person per month, 72 million Straits dollars can be obtained annually, equivalent to 50 billion yuan in national currency. The company's savings acceptance period is temporarily set at five years. If 50 billion is concentrated each year, 250 billion yuan can be obtained in five years. Then it will be set as the total amount of capital of this company.

The savings received by the company each month will be the shareholders' capital. All of it will be deposited into the local Bank of China and lent to the government at an annual interest rate of 6%. It will be settled once a month. Each time, the annual interest will be deducted first as capital for the company's development of basic construction. If 50 billion yuan is saved each year, the company can receive 30 million in interest in the first year, 60 million in the second year, 90 million in the third year, and 120 million in the fourth year. With this interest alone, a large-scale industry can be developed in the country. Five years later, when the war of resistance is won, order is restored, and the government is able to repay the principal, the company can become a capital group with over 300 billion yuan.

But how do we launch this business?

First, a sound theory is needed. Economic scholars from the entire country should first be invited to discuss and criticize this issue from various perspectives.

Second, a strict practical plan is needed. The best experts in the country should be recruited to engage in the design of the company's self-operated savings and lending, as well as various specific industrial constructions.

Third, close contact should be made with the government leading the resistance and national construction. All legislative plans of the company should be passed through the responsible government agencies and strictly accepted government supervision.

Fourth, a great cause needs a strong backing. The Overseas Chinese Savings Lending and Construction Silver Company is undoubtedly a great cause. Its success or failure will depend on whether it can obtain the support of enlightened people from all walks of life in society and whether it can obtain the response of the broad masses. Therefore, it is necessary to widely solicit domestic and foreign leaders and ask them to support this movement in the name of sponsors and founders.

Fifth, the patriotic enthusiasm of overseas Chinese is universal, but only a small number have the opportunity to fully express their patriotism. We know that there are tens of thousands of ambitious and promising fighters among the overseas Chinese masses in various ports, who are buried in the corners and ignored. But when they get a hard-won opportunity, what they can do for the country will definitely not be less than other overseas Chinese. Therefore, we must do our best to discover this group of hidden fighters and let them come out to participate in this movement.

Sixth, after the sponsors and founders from various places are gathered, we may first hold a founders' meeting to establish a temporary council and a temporary office, start calling on overseas Chinese to implement savings, and contact government agencies to handle various collection and payment procedures and sign necessary contracts.

Seventh, after the first year's capital is collected, a shareholders' meeting will be convened according to the shares, and official directors will be elected to form the board of directors. The official establishment of the company will be announced, and the temporary council and temporary office will be cancelled.

### Market Knowledge Consultant - Mr. Liu Qi Asks

(1) How are the legal exchange rate and the black market exchange rate calculated? Please list the calculation method and formula using the US dollar as an example, and provide a detailed explanation.

(2) What is the basis for the rise and fall of gold prices? Please list the formula and explain how to calculate it in detail.

(3) Is it more advantageous to purchase US dollars in Hong Kong or Haiphong with Hong Kong dollars or Vietnamese currency than to purchase US dollars with legal currency in Shanghai?

The legal exchange rate is the foreign exchange rate under the control of the central government. The British exchange rate is 1 shilling and 2.25 pence, and the US exchange rate is 29.5 yuan (for its calculation method, please refer to "Economic Common Sense" written by Mr. Yang Yinpu).

(1) Black market exchange rate: To know the fluctuations of the black market exchange rate, you must first understand the meaning of the word "black market." Shanghai has always been a free market, with more imports than exports. According to the customs trade register, there has been a trade deficit for decades, so a large amount of foreign exchange is needed. Since the central government issued control orders, restrictions have been very strict. Foreign exchange cannot be applied for without proper procedures. Since the national army moved west, the central government's power has been beyond reach. Speculators took the opportunity to move and make waves, profiting from it and forming a black market for foreign exchange. Although the central government's HSBC price remained unchanged, the black market changed rapidly. It is an illegal transaction. In the future, the government may order a crackdown. Therefore, there is no fixed standard for black market prices. It all depends on the supply and demand situation and the changes in the situation.

### Hidden Reefs in the Future of Raw Silk

— Shi Xiang

Since the start of the spring silkworm season this year, two weeks have passed. The price of cocoons has broken last year's highest record. In particular, Wuxi is the most prominent. The large purchases by cocoon dealers are around 400 yuan. For the best quality cocoons, factories will bid at a high price of 450 yuan to 500 yuan. If the recent silk prices in Shanghai are converted into cocoon prices for comparison, there is no profit to be made from purchasing goods at such high prices, and there is even a loss.

Recently, New York's raw silk market has been quiet due to the sharp reduction in inventory and consumption. Foreign firms have lowered market prices. The eating price for white filature with 78-point regularity is only 4,800 yuan to 5,000 yuan. Still watching the development of the European situation. If we use last year's spring cocoons as an example, the average price of fresh cocoons was 120 yuan per picul. If 280 catties of baked cocoons are baked to form a picul of dry cocoons, the price of dry cocoons is only 236 yuan per picul. If 400 catties are reeled to produce a picul of raw silk, plus a production cost of 200 yuan, then the cost of each picul of silk is 1,650 yuan. Later, the Shanghai-US exchange rate suddenly shrank from 14 yuan to 6 or 7 yuan. In addition, overseas silk sales were smooth, and market prices rose daily. Chinese silk prices were aided by this change, so the speed of the sharp rise exceeded expectations. The price of raw silk had reached over 4,600 yuan per picul during the autumn silkworm season. It was already three times the profit. When the autumn cocoon market opened, Germany had already put pressure on Czechoslovakia. After a temporary peace, the silk market stabilized. Large purchases of autumn cocoons were above 250 yuan to 280 yuan. The best goods in the south of Wuxi even reached above 300 yuan. The cost of raw silk was over 4,000 yuan. Later, silk prices increased daily. Before the winter solstice, each picul of silk had risen to the 7,000 yuan mark. The factories made huge profits. At the end of the year, some made profits of several million yuan. This was due to (1) low cost, (2) sharp shrinkage of foreign exchange, and (3) smooth silk sales. Looking back at this year, due to the increase in small factories, there was a rush to purchase cocoons, and cocoon prices were released excessively. Therefore, costs have increased. Recently, the European war has intensified, Italy has officially declared war, and foreign exchange has seen a rebound. The New York silk market is sluggish, and market prices are showing a wavering trend. Silk factory operators have said that this year's business can be said to be like passing a difficult hurdle, unpredictable. The cocoon capital has already been large, and the silk market is unstable. The only question is to look at America.

Looking at the above table, the costs of last spring and this spring are very different. Even comparing the current cost of 5,049 yuan with the silk price of foreign firms in Shanghai, there is a loss of 49 yuan. To sell foreign firm silk, it is necessary to meet the standards of regularity and have a quality of 78 points regularity. If the inspection results are not good, the selling price must be lowered. Therefore, this year's silk factories should pay special attention to the quality of their products, and internal work should be more diligent. If the reeling can save twenty or thirty catties, the cost can be reduced by more than two hundred yuan. This depends on the quality of the cocoons received and the ability of the managers.

### Wenzhou Charcoal Soars

Since the beginning of the month, 1,000 piculs of Wenzhou charcoal have been shipped by steamer. Since then, there have been no more arrivals, so the market inventory has gradually been exhausted, and the price has soared. Recently, the industry in the city has broken the price of 10 yuan and 5 cents per picul, which is more than one yuan better than the quotation in the first ten days of the month. Other second-class goods such as Haimen flat cap charcoal have also taken the opportunity to rise to about 8 yuan per picul. Small bamboo basket Huangyan charcoal is 6 yuan and 8 cents. The above are all ex-warehouse prices. Delivery adds 2 cents per picul for cartage.

### Dutch Tin Gradually Turns Around

In the Dutch tin market, the Hangzhou and Shaoxing merchants could do nothing before, and transactions on this street also felt sluggish, so the market price had once fallen back. However, since recently, the European war has become increasingly expanded, and the tin-producing areas of the Dutch Indies have been greatly threatened. Transportation is also quite difficult. The future source may be hindered. In addition to the Hong Kong gang and hoarders who have some existing goods in the local area, the remaining merchants have all sold out. Therefore, yesterday's market price has seen a sharp increase. For example, the number one goods with 99.9% purity sold for 1,800 yuan, 99.5% purity sold for 1,700 yuan, and third-class goods were also called for 1,500 yuan. Yesterday's transactions were only a dozen or twenty from the canning factory, printing gang, and machine factory families on this street. Most merchants from other ports are watching.

### New Disk Yuan Price Also Falls

The new disk yuan market price mostly fluctuates up and down with the local circular nail. Recently, because the local nail market has stepped back, the new disk yuan market price has also seen a decline. Yesterday's market price was called for 65 yuan per picul, and transactions were also quite light. Because the nail factories on this street see that the output of their goods is not widely sold, there is a large amount of existing goods, so there is no urgent intention to purchase raw materials, so there are not many transactions. Others, such as construction gangs, also only sold dozens of piculs.

### Coarse Car White Sugar Returns Tightly

Yesterday's sugar market saw an increase in importers, and the trend improved. The association divided the existing goods of No. 24 coarse white sugar outside the warehouse at 70 yuan and a half to 70 yuan and 6 cents. Re-export goods are gradually tightening, initially at 56 yuan, and then rising to 56 yuan and 3 cents and 5 cents, rising 5 cents. The Taikoo Car White B mark was 82 yuan and a half to 83 yuan, rising 5 cents. National sugar is being released.

### Xuzhou Golden Vegetables Report Poor Harvest

Xuzhou News: Due to the drought this year, the new golden vegetables are difficult to grow, and the branches are very short, which has already shown signs of scarcity. It is expected that the harvest will only be 40% to 50%. It can be seen around the beginning of next month, and there is a saying that a certain party is controlling it. If it is implemented, it will inevitably increase exploitation.

### Cassia Twigs Overflowing the Market

Cassia twigs originate from Guangzhou. Due to the region's occupation, although Chinese merchants still transport them, they are subject to certain restrictions, making it difficult to profit. Consequently, the supply has been scarce, and the market has been firm. However, recently, some foreigners have directly shipped them to Shanghai, resulting in a surge of goods and an abundance in the market. People are becoming bearish, and the opening price has already dropped by five or six yuan compared to the previous market.

### Honeysuckle Stabilizes

The new honeysuckle has already appeared on the market. Recently, a batch has been opened, and the quality is still good, but the color is slightly pale. The highest price is calculated at 210 yuan with remittance, and the next highest is 200 yuan to 190 yuan. The demand is still active, and the market is stable.

Two-Sex Hygiene

### Men with Deficiency of Essence and Kidney

— Authored by American Medical Doctor Huang Zhongchang

Factors Leading to Marital Breakdown

Speaking of the tragic situation after a couple falls out, it's simply indescribable. Even if one is fortunate enough to have a relatively gentle wife, she may remain calm on the surface but secretly feel resentful and regretful, being unhappy all day long. But if one encounters an uninhibited woman, she will inevitably retaliate, leading to mutual quarrels and even court appearances, seeking divorce. All of this stems from the husband suffering from hidden illnesses, weakness, or incomplete development, resulting in a lack of coordination in reproductive functions, leading to such tragic events of separation and death.

I am a specialist in venereal diseases. Doctors prioritize protecting the interests of patients. I firmly believe that in cases of such diseases, it is crucial to avoid purchasing new, branded, cheap, and inferior drugs. The market is flooded with various medicines, especially Western tonics made with counterfeit Chinese medicine ingredients, with all sorts of tricks and nonsensical claims, such as being made with white fungus, tortoise plastron, tiger bone, or even adding ginseng, bird's nest, and deer antler. It is important to know that these medicines not only lack these ingredients but also such things don't exist. Because, Western tonics made with Chinese medicine ingredients, this extraction method has not yet been invented, nor is there any need for invention. Why? If you want to take Chinese medicine tonics, why not directly buy and decoct them? All of these are responsible words. If you don't believe me, there are Chinese medicine stores everywhere in this city. You can ask the store staff. Do they know of such situations, and whether such inferior medicines that claim to have Chinese medicine ingredients and deceive people in the form of Western medicine actually have the ingredients they claim? Then you will suddenly understand. You must know that the reason for deficiency of essence and kidney is due to the damage to the puberty glands, which control sexual desire, caused by masturbation or indulgence. Therefore, you must take "Buti Kang" for men, a preparation made with the puberty gland extract of robust animals. "Buti Kang" not only uses animal endocrine as the main ingredient but also contains brain-nourishing phosphorus, blood-tonifying iron, and bone-strengthening calcium, truly having the effect of nourishing the brain, kidney, and essence. Only those with spermatorrhea should be treated with "Naiersi Spermatorrhea Tablets". Women with irregular menstruation, anemia, breast lumps, or incomplete development should take "Buti Kang" for women.

### Cured Cases of Spermatorrhea

— German Medical Doctor Zheng Ting

Patient Hu Xixiang, 23 years old, from Pudong, formerly the assistant accountant at Peidong Tobacco Factory. (Self-report) — When I was 16 years old, I made friends carelessly and developed the habit of masturbation. By the age of 18, my masturbation became even more severe, causing my body to weaken day by day. The frequency of spermatorrhea was highest at the age of 18, averaging twice a week. If I overworked, I would suffer from spermatorrhea, my sexual organs would be small, my head would be dizzy, my back would ache, and I would have all sorts of ailments. Although I have now recognized the harm of masturbation and quit, my symptoms remain. I deeply know that if I don't cure it completely, the future consequences will be dire, so I specially seek treatment. (Symptoms at the time of diagnosis) — Weight 100 pounds, pale complexion, poor development, poor appetite, frequent spermatorrhea, fatigue upon waking up, sexual neurasthenia has spread to the brain. (Treatment process) — I instructed him to take good care of his health, pay attention to exercise, have electrotherapy for 15 minutes every day, and take three German Biwan sperm essence preparation "Buti Kang" for men three times a day. Before going to bed, he also took "Naiersi Spermatorrhea Tablets", which are specifically for treating spermatorrhea. After a month, he felt his essence was sufficient and his spirit was vigorous upon waking up, his appetite improved, his complexion improved, and the frequency of spermatorrhea decreased to once a week. Spermatorrhea was completely eradicated. He took it for another month, and all symptoms disappeared. He then stopped taking it. One month after stopping, his weight increased by five pounds.

### Success of Chemical Therapy for Gonorrhea

— German Medical Doctor Wang Kechun

The use of chemical therapy for gonorrhea did not start today, but its success with chemical therapy started today. After the invention of these therapies, gonorrhea patients have begun to gain the freedom obtained with syphilis. Now there is the latest gonorrhea chemical therapy, "Xin Ke Lin Nong." This agent is the result of years of efforts to research and improve by Dr. Peter, a German gonorrheal scientist. Originally, the gonorrheal diplococcus is very stubborn and can resist weak bactericidal power, and is rich in reproductive power, so when we do not completely kill the gonococcus, it already has new followers and redevelops internally, which is why general bactericidal drugs on the market are ineffective. Only the drug "Xin Ke Lin Nong" is based on the principles of chemical therapy and is more improved. Its bactericidal power is very strong and rapid, but there are no adverse reactions to general chemical therapy. After taking German "Xin Ke Lin Nong," all deep and shallow gonococci can be completely eliminated, so all acute and chronic leukorrhea can be completely and thoroughly resolved. As for external medicine, men can use "Anti-Lin Water" externally according to the diagram and instructions to secretly wash the urethra at home. Women can use "Ka Er Xue Di Vaginal Tablets" as suppositories. Take "Xin Ke Lin Nong" internally (all three medicines are sold at Taihe Pharmacy)

### Gonorrhea Lecture: Incessant Gonorrheal Filaments

The symbol of gonorrhea, in addition to the rice-colored urine discharge, there are also incessantly flowing gonorrheal filaments that discharge from the urethra. The incessant nature of these filaments is proof that the gonorrhea has not healed. Wherever there is a trace of gonococci inside, inflammation occurs, and these inflammations are conditions for producing filaments. The presence of filaments is evidence that the gonorrhea has not healed. However, there are also cases where the filaments have stopped, but the gonorrhea has not healed. One must have an experienced doctor to have the ability to distinguish. The shape of the filaments is also inconsistent, some are dot-shaped, and some are fiber-shaped. These filaments are often caused by residual inflammation of posterior urethral gonorrhea. Cystitis and prostatitis are also common. Therefore, to eliminate these filaments, one must use a comprehensive treatment. Among the internal medicines, one must recommend the latest chemical therapy, "Xin Ke Lin Nong" (available at Wing On Company) as a giant. As for physical therapy, German static electricity therapy is the best. I always use these therapies together, which can resolve the filaments and completely cure gonorrhea, with remarkable effects. It also treats syphilis, buboes, chancres, sexual neurasthenia, and other diseases.

### Proven Cases of Tuberculosis Treatment

— Physician Sheng Zaiqiang

Patient Feng Yongde had a weak constitution. At the age of twenty, he suffered from hemoptysis. He recovered after resting for several months. Later, due to excessive brain use, it relapsed last summer, with chest tightness and shortness of breath, coughing up bloody phlegm. He had a mild fever of 37.7 degrees in the evening, and his body became increasingly thin and haggard. He had difficulty sleeping at night, had many dreams and palpitations, and suffered from night sweats, leading to dizziness and fatigue upon waking up. After an X-ray examination, there were small cavities the size of silver coins in the lungs, and tuberculosis had reached the third stage. He was prescribed German "Xiu Fei Na Er" internally. After taking less than two bottles, the night sweats and fever were eliminated, and the condition greatly improved. Therefore, he continued to take it continuously for three weeks, and at the same time, he was instructed to rest absolutely quietly at home and consume more nutritious foods. The cough, shortness of breath, hemoptysis, and other symptoms were completely cured, and his appetite greatly increased, and his weight increased. He was transformed into a strong and handsome man.

### The Seriousness of Stomach Ailments

The stomach is located between the heart and abdomen and holds the central hub of the body's digestive functions. However, often due to our improper diet, stomach ailments arise, such as loss of appetite, vomiting, nausea, and unbearable stomach pain, leading to internal damage and becoming a dangerous condition. At this time, one must take "Qiang Wei Jing" to achieve relief, because "Qiang Wei Jing" can promote appetite, supply nutrition, and quickly cure all stomach ailments, pale complexion, anemia, constipation, etc. "Qiang Wei Jing" is sold at Wing On, Sincere, The Sun department stores, and Wuzhou on the Tianfei Palace Bridge.

### Admonishing a Prostitute-Loving Young Man (II)

His desire for pleasure is even more extravagant, taking courtesans in carriages, unafraid of meeting decent people. His eyes are filled with prosperity, and his ears are filled with noise. In an instant, he seems to be riding on clouds. He goes home, spending his days in darkness, indulging in opium dens. Quickly, the sedan chair is carried, and he goes to the restaurant with a smile. He busily pulls up a stool and places it beside her. "You have a cup, and I have a cup. If the young master loses the drinking game, the courtesan will take his place." Even more delighted, he whispers in her ear, "Come back early when the party is over." Competing for face, not wealth, they set up a drinking game at the roadside, everyone showing off their wealth. "You set up a single table, and I'll set up a double table. Whoever occupies the room will not give way." The unluckiest is he who sleeps alone on the bed, unable to see the jade beauty. The prodigal son has forgotten his home, seeing the young girl he wants to deflower. The blind man cannot distinguish the real from the fake. The crazy butterfly picks flowers, and the violent rain breaks buds. He is unafraid of the cyclical laws of nature. Don't be extravagant. See how his wife and daughters will bring about retribution without fail. How laughable are these people who listen to the courtesan wanting to redeem herself, selling all their land with joy. They don't care about the thousands of gold coins, nor about the poverty of their family. They still claim that they are doing it for love. Don't be dazed. Since you are not taking her as a concubine, why be so infatuated? Prostitution and gambling go hand in hand, picking a leader for the courtesans, asking people everywhere to invite friends. Today's entertainment, tomorrow's entertainment. The wealth of ten thousand gold coins will be reduced to nothing. Stop early, quickly repent, and live a peaceful life. Opium is inherently heartless, especially when it is readily available in brothels. Breathing it in every day becomes a true addiction. Desiring to increase energy, they gradually increase the dose, guaranteeing to ruin the hero's life. For the sake of happiness, they throw themselves into the trap, lamenting that there is no one to save them.

### Food Musings

— Zheng Yimei

"Peach blossoms dot the ground, leaving red snow; bamboo leaves brew spring water, replacing green tea," this is a poem by a certain predecessor. Using the tender buds of newly sprouted bamboo leaves, picking them and brewing tea, is indeed very fragrant, pleasant, and delightful.

The common food of Westerners is bread. Chinese people imitate them, so bread is flooding the market. Even the problem of eating rice is no longer a problem, unless it becomes a bread problem, to show that one is fashionable. Examining the ancients, there was no item called bread, but there was something called "bao mian" (wrapped noodles). Wei Juyuan's diet book of the Tang Dynasty: "Wonton is called 'chaoshao' by the Chu people, and also called 'bao mian'."

Common people must use perilla when cooking crab. Bo Sha Zhuolao's Leisurely Days mentioned: "Crabs with only one claw, one eye, four legs, or six legs, all have poison. Their nature is most afraid of perilla. All those who transport crabs from Tianjin to Beijing use donkeys and camels. They must first send people to scout the road. If there is perilla in the area, they will take a detour. If they accidentally touch its scent, none will survive." Also, my friend Zhuang Jun has not eaten crab for hundreds of years, saying that the cooking of crab is the most cruel. Thinking of it, he cannot bear to eat it.

Water chestnuts from South Lake are the best. Years ago, I bought a boat and climbed the Misty Rain Tower, peeling water chestnuts while leaning on the railing. Their freshness was indeed unmatched by those from other places. I heard that Zhangqiu Baiyun Lake also produces water chestnuts with a great reputation. Unfortunately, I have not been able to taste them. Pu Liuxian has a poem about eating water chestnuts from Baiyun Lake: "After the rain clears over the lake, red water chestnuts are densely covered with leaves. The mooring pole is freshly picked, singing out the autumn of Baiyun." Hearing this, I can't help but feel longing for the depths of Baiyun.

Wujiapi wine has a strong and fragrant taste of the country. Since Yue wine increased in price, Wujiapi wine has become even more prevalent in the market. According to history, this wine existed long ago. Li Zhulan's Six Inkstone Studio Notes said: "Wujiapi is named Yu Yan, also known as the writing grass. Qiao Zhou's Record of Strange Things from Ba and Shu, Praise of Writing Grass: 'Writing grass makes wine, which can complete its flavor. Buying grass with gold does not mean it is expensive.'"

Foods entering poems inevitably make people's mouths water when reciting them. For example, the late Chen Diexian said: "Quail bones are removed and fried into crispy pairs, radishes are pickled with the skin on in five spices, soy milk and butter tea are seasoned with monosodium glutamate, and cauliflower chicken congee is mixed with flowing yellow." Liangban Qiuyu Anzai has a poem: "Wuxi carp and Pengze wine, Guanzhou chestnuts and Huoshan tea." Hu Buyi said: "Mandarin fish appear on the peach blossom waves, water shield is fat when willow catkins fly," and also: "Green wine is so sweet that people easily get drunk, green tea can dilute the initial taste," and also: "Green jade cups are worthy of accompanying wine, golden chrysanthemum replaces boiled tea." If things like this are compiled, it would not be difficult to make a food poetry talk.

Eggplant is also called Luosu, and its purple color is quite lovely. I heard that those produced in Beiping are flat and round like persimmons, while those produced in Southern Guangdong are as long as a foot. This is due to the earth's energy.

River eel tastes delicious, but it is poisonous and can kill people. Therefore, there is a saying that one eats river eel while risking death. In fact, this is because the cooking method is not proper. If done properly, it will definitely not be poisonous. The mother of painter Wu Jun Hufan is good at cooking river eel. Her family regards river eel as a regular dish, often serving it with meals. Now that his mother has suddenly passed away, I am afraid that he will not be able to taste its flavor again.

### A Talk on Summer Clothing Experiences

— Plum

Summer has arrived, and white clothes will be everywhere again. However, this white color is most easily soiled, and even a slight stain is very ugly to see, so it must be washed.

Therefore, when wearing clothes in summer, one must be careful everywhere. For example, before sitting on a stool, one must first see if the stool is clean. It is best to wipe it with a handkerchief first, or when in the office, you can put a piece of white paper on the stool to avoid getting dirty. Also, when walking up the stairs, you have to lift your long gown a little to keep your clothes clean. When you get home, you can take off your long gown, short shirt, and pants immediately (wearing only a T-shirt and shorts is cool and convenient), fold them neatly and put them in the closet. Do not casually hang them on a hanger, which will definitely reduce the number of times you have to wash them. Of course, this can at least reduce the damage to the clothes.

Secondly, if you are in the office, you can also roll up the sleeves of your short shirt and fold the collar outward. This way, only the T-shirt will get wet when you sweat, so it is only good to wash the T-shirt.

In addition, regarding washing clothes, you must always instruct your wife or servants to wash them gently and lay them out neatly and straight when drying them. Because whether you are careful when washing clothes is very important for the damage to the clothes themselves. Do not wash them excessively. Wait until they are slightly dry before collecting and folding them. After folding them, wrap them in a cloth and put them on the table, then press them with a stool, or sit on the stool yourself. Sitting for an hour will make them as neat as if they had been ironed. This way, not only can you save on electricity bills, but also the clothes will not be easily damaged. In short, you can't be careless everywhere when wearing clothes in summer.

### Talking About Rice

— Green Leaves

The country takes the people as its foundation, and the people take food as their heaven. A country cannot be without people, and people cannot be without food. In the past six months, although the concession authorities have done a lot of work on the people's food supply, the manipulation and hoarding of unscrupulous merchants are still openly taking place, and the price of rice has broken the 60 yuan per shi mark. Those who have difficulty making a living and resort to illegal activities are really forced to do so. Tracing back to the source of the disaster, both the robbers and the unscrupulous merchants must jointly bear the responsibility for this impact on public security.

Shanghai people take rice as the main food for three meals a day. Although flour is also one of the people's food, its sales are not as strong as rice. Although there is no accurate statistic for reference on the total daily demand for rice in Shanghai, it is estimated to be more than 5,000 shi on average based on the number of sales in the market. Other entrepot trades are not included.

The sources of rice are different. Rice from various parts of this province is called "Du Mi" (local rice); rice from various parts of other provinces is called "Ke Xian" (guest indica rice); rice imported from abroad is called "Yang Mi" (foreign rice).

"Du Mi" is mostly transported from Changshu, Wuxi, Qingpu, Kunshan, Songjiang, Sijing, and other places. The quality of Changshu is the best. Changshu rice has large and uniform grains, soft texture and white color. When cooked, it is fragrant, glutinous, and smooth, and has a very strong swelling property. One bowl of rice can be cooked into three bowls of rice. Smart housewives are most happy to buy it. "Ke Xian" mostly comes from Wuhu, Jiujiang. The color is not white, and the grains are pointed and long. It must be re-milled in the factory before it can be sold. "Yang Mi" is shipped from Annam to Shanghai by foreign merchant ships. The grains are small and dry. Shanghai people originally did not eat "Yang Mi," but since the price of rice has been high, they have switched to eating "Yang Mi." Among "Yang Mi," there is a kind of top grade, which comes from ____, with long, large, and clear grains, most suitable for frying rice, and its taste is not inferior to "Du Mi." This top-grade "Yang Mi" is not sold in ordinary shops, but only a few Guangdong food stores sell it. Some time ago, the bottom of Da Sun Company also sold it for more than 5 jiao per pound.

There are many kinds of rice. "Du Mi" and "Ke Xian" are just general names. There are more than a dozen detailed names: such as Bai Geng (white japonica), Tong Bian - also known as Bai Yuan (white round), commonly known as glutinous rice, Bo Dao (thin rice), Zao Geng (early japonica), Hong Dao (red rice), Xiang Geng (fragrant japonica), Ye Dao (wild rice), Yin Yuan (yin round), Yang Jian (foreign pointed), Du Jian (local pointed), Bu Jian (wharf pointed), Ling Bai Jian (water chestnut pointed), Lu Jian (reed pointed), etc.

Glutinous rice is needed for making pastries and other things, and it is also the main raw material for brewing wine. The main source is Danyang. Bo Dao - also known as Wan Geng (late japonica), contains stickiness, and is sold in Tianjin, Dalian, Qingdao, and other ports. The market price is on par with the top-grade Bai Geng. Zao Geng and Hong Dao are produced along the Jinghu ports. Xiang Geng is the best product for cooking porridge, not only delicious, but also fragrant. Yang Jian - also known as Yang Xian, has excellent swelling properties, but it is not sticky and glutinous. It is very different from japonica rice and is not suitable for making cakes. It can only be used for cooking rice. It is shipped from Jintan, Aoyang, Yixing, and other places to Shanghai, and the sales are mostly in Tianjin, Fujian, and Ningbo. Du Jian - also known as Du Xian, has round grains, similar to japonica rice, and is often mixed with Bai Geng for sale in small rice shops. Ling Bai Jian is the Du Jian harvested when the water chestnut is growing. Lu Jian is the one harvested when the reed is plump. Yang Jian is named because the grains are thin and long like goat horns. These names, when spoken by people in the rice industry, make people confused, but once explained, they are not surprising!

People from Beiping, Tianjin, Jinan, Taiyuan, and other places who live in Shanghai do not often eat rice, but often eat millet porridge. The so-called millet is a kind of sticky sorghum, similar to the fine rice that Shanghai people feed birds. But millet porridge is very nutritious, sweet, and gentle on the stomach, soft and glutinous, and the price is not as high as japonica rice. It is really the best food.

The price of rice rises again and again. Some people advocate using japonica rice to cook porridge, and I also agree very much. An ancient person has a poem about eating porridge, which may be chanted:

"Cooking rice is not as good as cooking porridge, you should discuss it with your daughter! One liter can be used as two liters, and two days can be used as six days of food; if there is a guest, it does not matter to add water and fire, if there is no money, why ask for soup, do not dislike the plain taste, in the plainness, the taste is long."

### One Week Economical Menu

— Ms. Hua Ying

This year, the season for eating new broad beans seems to be very short. After not many times, the beans are already old. Recently, the price of beans is around 2 jiao 5 fen per jin, which is still not very expensive in this time of soaring prices. Moreover, beans are rich in vitamins, so you may want to eat more of them. However, there are not many ways to cook old broad beans. If you want to change the pattern, it is really not easy to change. The most common household method is to shell the beans, spread them into a paste, and stir-fry them with pickled mustard greens or chopped green onions. If you want to save some soy sauce, then just use salt, and do not use soy sauce at all. Another method is to not spread them into a paste, but simply use the broad bean kernels and make soup with pickled mustard greens, adding a little sesame oil, which is also refreshing and delicious. In addition, you can not remove the skin and shell, and braise them with soy sauce, making Wusu beans to eat. As for meat methods, I have not heard much. I once minced pork (beef is also acceptable) into a paste and stir-fried it with broad bean paste. When eating, I used a little spicy soy sauce, which has a very Western flavor. Readers may want to try it.

Monday: Stir-fried shredded pork with green peppers, sweet and sour pomfret, stir-fried broad bean paste with pickled mustard greens, Qing Sha cabbage

Tuesday: Beef broad bean paste, braised salted fish with tofu, stir-fried calcium tendon with shrimp roe

Wednesday: Stir-fried diced meat with sword beans, fried yellow croaker with pickled mustard greens, stir-fried red vegetables, stinky dried tofu

Thursday: Yangcong shredded beef, clear fresh fish, braised vegetarian ten scenery, fried dough sticks and soybean sprouts

Friday: Cabbage-wrapped meat, egg drop soup with dried shrimps, stir-fried dried shredded bean curd with green peppers, tofu with toon

Saturday: Sweet potato beef soup, stir-fried seasonal shrimp with cucumber, braised tofu with spinach, chopped green onion broad bean paste

Sunday: Meat stewed sauce, fried ribbonfish, stir-fried vegetables, soybean sprouts

### Home Safety

— Dong Er

The American Kaiser City Children's Department has compiled statistics on the causes of accidental death and injury to children in the home, which can be divided into several points: (1) steps on stairs that are concave in the middle or already dilapidated; (2) ropes used for hanging or tying are very loose, and if they break, heavy objects will fall; (3) scattered gravel and broken glass on the ground that have not been cleaned up; (4) knives, forks, bamboo strips, and the like are not put away properly, and it is not uncommon for children to cut their fingers while playing, and the statistics also record this as the most frequent occurrence.

These are just the most common points. In addition, the Children's Department points out that doing the following can greatly reduce misfortunes in the home: (1) open windows should have iron bars, but if not, install leather straps or ropes; (2) a gate should be installed at the top of the stairs so that children can play safely nearby without worry; (3) the bottom of the stairs in some homes is very dark, making it difficult to find footing, and there have been many falls, so white paint should be applied to the bottom; (4) poisons such as Lysol should be placed out of the reach of children, and other medicines should also be treated the same way, otherwise the bottles and boxes should be sealed with glue-coated thread; (5) it is naturally best if the home stove can be equipped with a water copper hanger, but some stoves have uneven tops, and if the copper hanger is on top, it will overturn with a touch, because burns are also the most common of unfortunate events in the home.

We believe that the above points can be adopted and implemented by general families, which will be very beneficial, and the difference between a safe family and a dangerous family lies in this.

Current Events

### Fines Are Useless

— Merchant

According to news from a few days ago, the French Concession Police Department inspected various shops in the concession and found more than a hundred cases of illegal business operations, all of which have been fined separately. This vigorous crackdown has at least dealt a serious blow to merchants who only seek profit. However, things took an unexpected turn. Yesterday's newspaper reported: "Among the eighty-three items in the French Concession, twenty-four have increased in price, of which eighteen are even higher than the prices in the Public Concession south of Suzhou Creek." This is not an accidental phenomenon, but shows that fines are useless.

Because raising prices, in their view, is no longer an illegal business operation. Even if the Police Department finds out and fines them a few dollars, it is of no consequence. As the saying goes, "the wool comes from the sheep." When the authorities are occasionally negligent (in fact, the Police Department cannot inspect every store every day), they can still recover from their customers. Therefore, to eradicate this phenomenon of "I'll raise prices myself," there must be more severe sanctions in addition to fines!

What are the severe sanctions? Announce the store name! If the detailed addresses and names of the more than one hundred shops that were fined are announced to all citizens, so that everyone remembers that they are "black shops" and refrains from entering, causing them to suffer in their business, then that can serve as a warning to others.

Life Report

### "Glass Cup"

— Chen Duo

"Want to sit for a while?" As we wandered aimlessly around the playground, a stylishly dressed, slightly seductive woman softly and pleadingly asked us.

We shook our heads, meaning no. Seeing that we could not fulfill her hope, the woman went off to search for another customer in frustration.

My colleague Sun nudged my arm and lightly told me: "This is a 'glass cup'!"

"Why is such a perfectly fine person called a 'glass cup'?"

"That's probably because they sell tea. Isn't tea served in glass cups? People use that term to symbolize that kind of woman?" He continued, "I have a female colleague from a yarn factory who is also working as a glass cup here. Do you want to see her?"

I nodded and followed him to a small garden on the eighth floor. Sun found his former colleague, a girl in her twenties.

Sun unexpectedly greeted her, brewed a cup of tea, and introduced me to her. A faint blush appeared on her face, which was covered in makeup, as if she felt infinitely ashamed.

Sun explained to her: "You are forced to do this by life. It doesn't matter." Then she told us:

"I used to be a colleague with Mr. Sun. We were both at the Yangshupu ×× Yarn Factory. He was a staff member, and I worked in the testing department. After the war, the yarn factory closed down, and all the staff and workers were dismissed, and from then on, I fell into the tide of unemployment. But how can I live without work? I had no choice but to come here to do this kind of thing. It's very embarrassing to talk about.

"To do this kind of thing, you just need an introduction from an acquaintance (mostly inspectors). No security deposit is required. Each section has a few dozen, and the larger ones, like the Da Jing Ban below, have more than a hundred people. We don't have a salary. We also have to give the tea room ten cups of tea money every day, two corners per cup, which means we have to pay two dollars every day. The rest is your income. If it's less, you have to make it up.

"The customers we entertain come from all walks of life: workers, small clerks, street heroes... Our livelihood depends entirely on those customers giving us extra tips. Usually, drinking a cup of tea will give us at least five or six corners, and good customers will give us more than one dollar.

"Our kind of life is also very hard. The venue is so small, and there are so many competitors. The show is divided into day and night sessions. If you do five or six or seven or eight cups in each session, it's already 'Na Ma Wen' [Cantonese slang, meaning 'lucky']. Most only get one or two cups, and many still have to 'eat duck eggs' [get nothing]...

We paid and said goodbye to her, taking the opportunity to make a bird's-eye view of this area. We saw all kinds of people lying on rattan mats, with so-called "glass cups" standing or sitting beside them, tirelessly pouring "intoxicating soup" to obtain their daily living materials. But many were walking around anxiously, looking around like hunting dogs, looking for their customers.

When we left, it was already ten o'clock. We looked at the water sign board on the counter, and many "glass cups" had one or two strokes written under their names; many names were still blank, a "blank slate".

### The Dancer's Destiny

— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter 1 "A very pretty lady!"

Ni Jinshou replied: "No - not yet. As soon as I arrived here, I spoke a few words with Old Man Li and felt that this case was very complicated, so I told him to go upstairs and wait. I also assigned the three servants to three different locations and called you first. Then I called the police station and asked them to send a hearse. Because of the telephone line, it was delayed for a while. Then I found that bullet on this wall and started to extract it. Therefore, I haven't had time to take a closer look." After he finished speaking, he hurriedly walked out of the room.

While Ni Jinshou was explaining, Hawthorne had already reached out to open the drawer. There was indeed a small key left in the keyhole of the drawer lock. The key handle did not have any rings attached, so it was indeed easy to overlook. When Hawthorne opened the drawer, he did not turn the key, and the drawer opened easily, indicating that it had not been locked.

The things in the drawer seemed to be very noteworthy. The most striking thing was three large stacks of legal currency tied with hemp thread. It was estimated that each stack was about a thousand. There were also several men's photos. Although the sizes were not uniform, they were all "modern youths." In addition, there was a steel nickel-plated iron box key. Hawthorne glanced at the photos and flipped through many invitation cards and documents, only taking the key out of the drawer. He said, "This key must be for the iron box over there." He leaned sideways and pointed to the northwest corner of the reception room.

I began to make a quick tour of the room. A large square of expensive thick carpet was laid on the waxed narrow-strip chestnut floor, and the muddy footprints led to the carpet. To the right of the deceased's seat, behind him, was a small white stone-topped round table, surrounded by four exquisite leather-cushioned short-backed chairs. In addition to an imported copper vase, there was a silver-plated ashtray on the round table, with several cigarette butts in the ashtray. There were also two glasses, one with some leftover fragrant wine. Further to the right of this small round table, against the wall, was a purple velvet couch, with three circular brocade cushions, which were also imported without exception. On the armrest at the end of the couch lay a light blue velvet short coat, clearly taken off the deceased. (17)
