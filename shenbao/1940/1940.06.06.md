Editorial

### Blatant Expression of Japan's Southward Ambitions

Japan's southward ambitions, and its coveting of the Dutch East Indies, have recently been given a more sinister and blatant expression by its Foreign Minister Arita. Previously, on April 15th, Arita's statement regarding the Dutch East Indies was the first major expression by the Japanese government regarding its southward intentions since the outbreak of the European war, which shocked the world at the time. The United States also immediately issued a solemn statement by Secretary of State Hull, stating that the status quo of the Pacific would not be allowed to change. However, Arita's statement, regardless of its content and meaning, appeared on the surface to be virtuous, as if only Japan was most concerned about the security of the Dutch East Indies and was prepared to shoulder the role of guardian of peace in the Pacific. The diplomatic rhetoric issued by various countries at the time almost confused even the most honest people as to who exactly wanted to change the status quo of the Dutch East Indies. This question is now answered by Arita, who made it clear in his speech at the Pacific Society on the 3rd of this month that the country harboring ambitions for the Dutch East Indies is none other than Japan.

The manner in which Arita made this statement this time is different from his previous expression as Foreign Minister representing the government, but at the same time, precisely because he was not speaking officially on behalf of the government, he could be less constrained by legal responsibility and consequences, which instead served to complement and explain the previous statement. Comparing the two, one can clearly see the difference in degree: previously, Arita only touched upon the political status quo of the Dutch East Indies, while this time he openly demanded full participation in local economic development(?); previously, he only expressed concern to ensure "security," while this time he hinted that he would not hesitate to use war as a last resort; previously, he only mentioned the Dutch East Indies, while this time he extended it to "territories south of Japan." In short, the previous statement was limited to a passive conservatism in its posture, while this time it transformed into an active offensive. Of course, the recent developments in the European war have somewhat stimulated Japan's appetite, but the desire to seize the Nanyang Islands is by no means a recent development. It is only that the extent to which it can be made public and the steps taken in action are controlled by the international situation and its own strength. Arita's statement is sufficient to warrant active attention from the world. If various conditions develop in a direction favorable to Japan, then Japan will surely follow with more blatant posture and actions. After the United States issued a statement previously, Japan did not have a major response; and after the European war extended to the Dutch mainland, Japan did not show signs of engaging in new actions. However, Japan's recent attitude indicates that the crisis in the Western Pacific is rapidly evolving, enough to dispel the complacency of people just days ago.

Objectively speaking, Japan's turning to aggressive southward expansion while having no solution to the invasion of China is a reckless adventure; but from the aggressor's point of view, Japan does have its active desire to invade the south. First, the Japanese warlords have regarded the Asian continent as a lifeline, but their plunder of the continent has already exceeded the saturation point, resulting only in erosion with little profit. The Dutch East Indies and the Nanyang Islands, however, possess abundant resources, such as rubber, petroleum, grain, and heavy metal minerals, which are the most in-demand commodities for Japan today. Second, among the international aggressors of the past decade, Japan has reaped much but has also suffered great losses. The invasion of China has been bogged down due to the underestimation of China's strength, and the subsequent development must take advantage of its own strengths to break through the opponent's weaknesses; in other words, use its relatively strong navy to seize the strategically complex and weakly defended Nanyang area. Third, as soon as the last European war began, Japan seized Qingdao and the German-owned territories in the South Pacific, and gained great economic benefits. But the European war has been raging for a long time, and Japan has not yet gained anything. The military, the zaibatsu, and the people under the sway of aggressive ideology have long felt impatient and are eager to prepare for robbery while the house is on fire. Fourth, although Arita's declaration previously aroused a worldwide response, the great powers' preventative measures are clearly not enough; and Japan has long been carrying out preparations for its southward expansion in the Pacific mandated islands and the Hainan Island, Xisha Islands, and Nansha Islands seized from China. As the European war continues to expand, Japan's strategic position for southward expansion will be further enhanced, and Japan will not easily let go of this situation. Therefore, while Japanese authorities are full of words about devoting all their efforts to resolving the China incident, in general, the interest of the radical elements in Japan has already shifted from China to Nanyang. Furthermore, Japan actually lacks awareness of the Sino-Japanese problem to this day, and its so-called resolution of the China incident can only be empty talk, and as a result, it will inevitably turn its frustrations in China into a new attempt on the South Pacific. Naturally, Japan's southward expansion steps have not yet reached a fully mature opportunity. Even the likes of Shiratori Toshio have criticized Arita's April 15 statement for being too rash. However, this crisis is increasing in direct proportion to Japan's failure in China and the expansion of the European war.

In Arita's speech, issues such as reciprocal trade were repeatedly mentioned. This is because Japan is heavily dependent on the Nanyang region economically, and before it can fully occupy it in one fell swoop, maintaining this peaceful trade relationship is a preliminary need for Japan. But do not mistakenly believe that as long as Japan's trade demands are met, a considerable degree of complacency can be maintained. It must be known that the southward expansion policy laid out with careful planning can never be shifted by a few minor concessions. Arita's speech is already a serious signal. If this crisis cannot be fundamentally eliminated with agile and powerful measures, then in the increasingly difficult international situation in the future, the great powers will be caught off guard in the Far East and will feel a major threat. This is something that the authorities of each country involved must be able to comprehend.

### Soviet Newspaper Analyzes the Chinese Situation; Domestic Unity is Also Consolidated; The Longer the War, the More Modernized the Army Becomes; Counteroffensive Against Japan Can Be Implemented in the Near Future

TASS Special Dispatch: The Pravda recently published an article analyzing the Chinese situation in detail and reviewing the future of China's war of independence, stating: "China's territory totals 11.6 million square kilometers, of which only 22% is occupied by the Japanese (according to figures from the pro-Japanese magazine Far East Times). In other words, 78% of the entire territory is still under the jurisdiction of the National Government. China's population totals 470,500,000 (1936 statistics), of which 57.5% reside in the free zone (not including 15 million refugees). As for the agricultural products of the occupied and free zones, if we study them, we can know that the amount of rice produced in the free zone accounts for 76.3% of the total, the barley production accounts for 65.5%, the sweet potato production accounts for 57.8%, and the grain production accounts for 52.6%. In addition, tung oil production is also very abundant (60% of tung oil production is concentrated in Sichuan, and other production areas are in provinces such as Guangxi and Guizhou). In recent years, especially in 1939, the inland production has been excellent, but in the occupied areas, due to war damage, the harvest is very small. The southwestern and southern provinces of China are extremely rich in wood products, as 75% of China's forests are located in the southwestern provinces. The same area is also rich in mineral deposits.

The free zone's copper production accounts for 71.7% of the country's total, manganese production accounts for 98.1%, and the production of tin, lead, nickel, antimony, arsenic, etc. accounts for 99.9%. Alum production accounts for 86.4%, and gold production accounts for 48%. Even under extremely difficult circumstances, industry in the inland provinces has still progressed. Clearly, China still needs to rely on a large amount of imported goods due to the failure to fully develop its industry, but the increase in domestic production is extremely important for China. Although Japanese economic experts have made pessimistic arguments about China's foreign trade, China's foreign trade is still increasing. The difficulties encountered by China, whose coastline is largely blockaded, are extremely significant, but if we try to compare the customs' foreign trade statistics from January to September 1939, we can understand that the free zone's foreign trade is extremely balanced (a trade surplus of 33,645,000 yuan), while the occupied zone has a huge trade deficit of 450 million yuan. Regarding China's political and military achievements, we cannot overestimate them. The Chinese army has been fighting a strong enemy for two years and ten months. The longer the war continues, the more modernized the army becomes. It can inflict significant blows on the enemy and can implement a counteroffensive in the near future. The further democratization of China's political institutions has made domestic unity even more consolidated. The Kuomintang's decision to convene the National Assembly, once realized, will be extremely important in history. The constitutional movement is currently expanding. The intense review of the provisions of the Constitution of the Republic of China by all parties proves that the entire nation is extremely concerned about the election for the National Assembly."

### Artillery Leads the Charge, Air Force Provides Cover: German Army Launches New Offensive; Fierce Attack on Weygand Line at Dawn Yesterday; Battle Line Extended East and West to 200 Kilometers

Berlin: Hitler issued a communiqué today announcing a new German offensive, stating that multiple German divisions and air squadrons have once again been deployed for combat. (Reuters, 5th)

Paris: According to the communiqué, based on all the news received from the front lines since early this morning, a new campaign has already begun. So far, the German army is launching fierce attacks along the coast and between the Laon and Soissons roads. (Reuters, 5th)

Paris: Military officials continued to state that starting at dawn today, the enemy has resumed offensive operations along a 200-kilometer front line, with the most intense attacks occurring in the following two areas: the area around the middle reaches of the Somme River near Amiens, where the enemy has established a bridgehead on the south bank of the river, but the important railway junction of Longueau and all bridges over the marshes formed by the Somme and Noye rivers are controlled by our forces; east of the Oise River, along the famous strategic thoroughfare of the "Chemin des Dames" along the Ailette Canal, and between La Fère, Laon, Anizy-le-Château, and Soissons, enemy artillery began heavy shelling from 4:00 AM this morning, while enemy aircraft also flew in to bomb our positions, followed by infantry assaults. However, as of 10:00 AM, there has been no tank activity. The two sides are still engaged in fierce fighting. In addition, in the upper reaches of the Somme River, between Amiens and the Crozat Canal, our forces have consolidated their positions in the Péronne and Ham areas and recaptured several bridgeheads. Rear defenses have also been reorganized. (Havas, 5th)

Paris: More than 500,000 elite German troops, spearheaded by the most ferocious artillery barrage in history and covered by nearly a thousand bombers, launched a terrifying attack on the Somme front today, attempting to break through the French lines and cut off the passage between the French front and Paris. The entire German right wing attacked the Somme line at 4:00 AM this morning. Countless German infantry also launched a fierce assault on the French lines at 5:00 AM, under the cover of heavy artillery and bombing. German planes filled the sky, darkening it, and countless bombs rained down to help the infantry cope with the French artillery fire. In this major battle, the Germans did not use large numbers of tanks and mechanized units as vanguards, but instead, infantry charged straight ahead along the entire Somme line from Abbeville, Amiens, and Péronne, to the Escaut River and the Canal du Nord. The Germans are now trying to gain a foothold on the south bank of the Somme River, advancing even under heavy French fire. This German operation is clearly the second phase of Schlieffen’s plan to attack Sedan. (United Press, 5th)

London: A French military spokesman stated that, so far, the reports received from the battle zone all indicate that the German offensive is still primarily using infantry supported by artillery. This tactic is no different from the offensive methods of 1918. The only new feature is the use of low-flying aircraft. It is noteworthy that, as of 10:00 AM this morning, there have been no reports of German forces using tanks in any part of the front line. Since the German offensive began this morning, their air force has not been seen carrying out heavy bombing in rear areas. According to the German army's usual practice in operations in Poland, Norway, and the Western Front, they always send the air force to heavily bomb rear areas at the start of an offensive. A Reuters military correspondent claimed that the renewed intensity of the German offensive proves that they cannot afford to lose time. The reason why the Germans chose this part of General Weygand's line to attack is that if the offensive succeeds, it will be the shortest route to Paris. The French front line, stretching approximately 200 miles from the coast to the Maginot Line, is intersected by many rivers. The plain, extending twelve miles between the Somme and Oise rivers, is the focal point of the current German offensive. The terrain there is flat and dry, making it suitable for tank operations. The current question is how many tanks the Germans still have available. The use of new armored divisions will be necessary to make this new offensive significant. The tanks used by the German army in the northern campaign have traveled a very long distance, and even vehicles that did not participate in combat need to be repaired after excessive use. According to reliable French sources, the design of the Weygand Line primarily addresses the possibility of a combined attack by tanks and low-flying aircraft, including many newly invented defensive points. Since the German breakthrough of the Sedan line, French Prime Minister Reynaud has appointed new personnel and applied new methods. France now has both of these. The only benefit of the northern battle is that it has given French soldiers time to practice. (Reuters, 5th)

Allied Evacuation Completed; German Army Occupies Dunkirk

Paris: The General Headquarters issued a war report tonight stating: "The Allied forces have successfully completed their evacuation from the port of Dunkirk by ship today, according to the predetermined plan. Until the last moment, the rearguard units of the Allied forces bravely resisted in the suburbs of Dunkirk, and later engaged in street fighting with the enemy in the city. Although the enemy became more numerous as the fighting progressed, the Allied forces counterattacked from time to time. The last batch boarded ships under enemy machine-gun fire. The success of this evacuation is largely due to the effective defense and skillful command of Vice Admiral Abrial and General Fagalde of our Navy. At present, the strength of our forces in the northern region is intact and ready to resume combat at any time. The three armed forces of our country can cooperate seamlessly, and the British Army, Navy, and Air Force can also maintain close contact with us. Vice Admiral Abrial praised the great achievements of the British forces. The enemy's original intention was to encircle the Allied forces and force them to surrender, but the Allied forces,堅強不屈 and were able to break through the encirclement, which was beyond the enemy's initial expectations. In addition, fighting continued on the lower reaches of the Somme River this morning." (Havas, 4th)

Other ships have also sustained damage and have been towed to various ports for repairs. The evacuation of the last batch of troops was orderly. The last person to leave Dunkirk was Vice Admiral Abrial, who departed the port at 7:00 AM yesterday." (Havas, 5th)

London: A communiqué from the British War Office stated: "The evacuation of the Allied forces from the Dunkirk area has now been successfully completed. The last batch of troops withdrew on the night of June 3rd to 4th. This evacuation was a military operation of unprecedented difficulty. Due to the Allied forces' greatest fighting qualities, their calm and disciplined conduct in the most adverse conditions, the Allied forces'尽心　　, and the Royal Air Force's valiant efforts, the evacuation achieved remarkable success. Although our losses are significant, they are much lighter compared to the losses that seemed inevitable a few days ago. Our forces are now fighting alongside the French Army south of the Somme River. Yesterday, the British front line 平　　事." (Reuters, 5th)

On May 10th, German forces, under the command of the Führer and Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, pressed against the enemy's border positions, broke through south of Namur, and achieved the goal of destroying the Allied forces north of the Aisne and Somme rivers. At the same time, they quickly occupied the Netherlands to prevent British forces from using it as a base for land and air forces. This task was completed on June 4th. These twenty-odd days were filled with heroic deeds of German soldiers, a glorious page in the history of German leadership. Since the start of the campaign on May 10th, Germany, due to the exceptionally complete cooperation of its land, sea, and air forces, forced the Netherlands to surrender after five days, on the 14th. At the same time, in both the northern and southern parts of Belgium, not only were the enemy's border fortifications breached, but also the enemy's mechanized units were repulsed. German forces reached the Meuse River on May 13th, and the next morning, using blitzkrieg tactics, broke through the French Ninth Army's line, crossed the Meuse River under air cover, destroyed enemy defenses, and reached the Oise River. Simultaneously, a surprise attack was launched on Abbeville. From southern Luxembourg, the forces pressed towards the Aisne and Somme rivers along the Maginot Line. Mobile units advanced northward, with the left flank reaching the coast and the right flank encircling Cambrai and Arras. The enemy suffered unprecedented losses. By May 22nd, the enemy forces in Flanders and Artois were on the verge of annihilation. Our forces launched a fierce attack northward, defeating the French First and Seventh Armies, occupied the Mortier battery, captured Boulogne and Calais, and occupied Mont de Cassel and Montagne de Watten with the most intense fighting. On May 28th, due to our forces' continuous victories, King Leopold of Belgium decided to surrender. Thus, the British forces began their so-called "heroic evacuation." Although the British forces claimed to have "withdrawn in good order," the abandoned military equipment and supplies were countless. On June 4th, the port of Dunkirk was captured, and the first phase of the Western Front campaign came to an end. In summary, Germany's success on the Western Front was due to the excellence of its air force, which enabled the German High Command to obtain intelligence on all enemy activities, destroy the enemy's navy, and strike at the enemy's morale. The greatness of the victory can be seen in the enemy's losses. (Haitong Press, 5th)

Berlin: A German military expert, upon meeting with a Haitong Press correspondent, supplemented the war report released yesterday by the German High Command, stating in brief: "French airfields and air force facilities around Paris were bombed into ruins by our air force on the 3rd. The French air force is now concentrated in the suburbs of Paris. Military installations along the Seine River have also been largely destroyed by bombs. After our forces entered Dunkirk, we discovered that most of the defending forces there were French, not British. Although they resisted desperately, they could not prevent our forces from occupying Dunkirk." (Haitong Press, 5th)

Germany Announces Mutual Losses; Jubilation in Berlin

Berlin: German Führer Hitler, in a proclamation to the nation this morning, stated: "German citizens, our soldiers, have achieved victory in an unprecedented great war. Within five weeks, our forces have captured over 1.2 million enemy soldiers. The Netherlands and Belgium have already surrendered. Most of the British Expeditionary Force has been annihilated, with the rest either captured or driven off the continent. The French army has also suffered great losses, and the danger of enemy forces invading the Ruhr area has also been eliminated. German citizens, this historically glorious achievement is the result of our soldiers' bloody and arduous fighting. Therefore, I order that flags be flown across the country for eight days starting today, and church bells be rung for three days, to celebrate." The Führer's proclamation concluded with a statement that German soldiers continue to fight for the freedom and happiness of the people and was dated June 3, 1940. (Haitong Press, 5th)

The four countries of Britain, France, Belgium, and the Netherlands suffered a total loss of 1.2 million prisoners. Casualties, missing, and those who drowned while swimming are not included in this number. The captured firearms and military supplies totaled approximately 75 to 80 divisions, including the largest caliber cannons, tanks, armored vehicles, etc. From May 10th to June 3rd, the German Air Force shot down a total of 1,841 enemy aircraft, of which 1,142 were shot down by aircraft and 699 were shot down by anti-aircraft guns. In addition, at least 1,600 to 1,700 were destroyed on the ground. In naval operations, five enemy cruisers, seven destroyers, three submarines, and nine other ships, and sixty-six merchant ships were sunk. The German light naval fleet also destroyed six enemy destroyers, two submarines, one transport ship, one auxiliary ship, and one other warship.

During the same period, i.e., from May 10th to June 3rd, the German army suffered a total of 10,052 officers and soldiers killed, 8,463 missing, and 42,523 wounded. The Air Force lost 432 aircraft. However, the Navy suffered no losses on the coasts of France, Belgium, and the Netherlands. Today, Germany controls the entire southeastern coast of the North Sea and the English Channel. This war will continue until the Allied forces are completely destroyed. (Haitong Press, 5th)

London: According to qualified sources here, the number of British losses proclaimed in Hitler's High Command communiqué is highly unreliable. The British losses have been announced, approximately 30,000 soldiers. Details of naval losses were provided in last night's communiqué, totaling six destroyers and twenty-four other ships sunk out of 222 naval vessels serving at Dunkirk. As per custom, the Naval Department will release all loss figures once the relatives of those lost have been notified. The official loss figures for the British Air Force are 302 aircraft from May 10th to the present, which is the accumulated total of losses published by the Air Ministry each period. Although the 1,841 enemy aircraft claimed to have been shot down by the German side include all Allied aircraft participating in the war, since the aircraft of the British Air Force participated in the war the most, their losses are naturally greater than those of other Allied air forces. (Reuters, 5th)

Berlin: The German High Command reported on the German military's achievements in Flanders at 11:30 PM last night on the radio. The radio station broadcast military songs from 10:00 PM, and the public listened to the broadcast in restaurants, offices, or homes, extremely excited and happy. After the German High Command reported on the achievements, the radio station rebroadcast music and marches. (Haitong Press, 5th)

### British and French Air Forces Retaliate Against Germany; Bomb Military Targets Deep Inside German Territory; Over 1,000 Killed and Wounded in Paris Air Raid

Paris: The Air Ministry recently announced: "Between 125 and 150 German aircraft bombed the suburbs of Paris on the 2nd of this month. Twenty-five were shot down, all crashing within our borders. Our aircraft have taken retaliatory measures, flying to the German cities of Frankfurt and Munich to bomb airfields, train stations, railways, and factories, inflicting damage. One important German aircraft engine factory was also hit. Our pilots witnessed bombs exploding and fires spreading, and also took reconnaissance flights, obtaining important information. All have safely returned to their bases. In addition, our aircraft bombed German concentration points and tank columns north of the Somme River, and took photographs at other points along the front lines, especially north of the port of Abbeville." (Havas, 4th)

London: According to an announcement from the Air Ministry, large squadrons of Royal Air Force heavy bombers carried out a third consecutive night raid on Monday, bombing oil depots and tanks in western Germany, dropping high-explosive and incendiary bombs, hitting many targets, and causing loud explosions and intense fires, demonstrating the success of the night raid on industrial targets and transportation hubs. The British aircraft attacked areas from Emmerich in the north to Frankfurt in the south. Several oil tanks in Emmerich were hit first and caught fire, illuminating the surrounding area. The British aircraft that arrived later easily found their targets, and subsequent bomb hits caused larger fires. A munitions factory in Monheim was attacked several times, with hundreds of incendiary bombs dropped by British aircraft, causing large fires in the bombed areas. British aircraft successfully bombed oil refineries, oil tanks, and munitions factories in many locations in the Ruhr Valley. Enemy light and heavy anti-aircraft guns and searchlights closely coordinated to resist fiercely. A large group of searchlights in Kleve was hit, and searchlights elsewhere were also hit and extinguished. (Reuters, 5th)

London: The Air Ministry issued a communiqué stating: "Aircraft of the Coastal Command attacked Ghent last night. At least three large oil tanks were hit and caught fire, illuminating the surrounding area. British aircraft flew at an altitude of 10,000 feet. Other aircraft of the Coastal Command attacked military targets in the Netherlands. Pilots and aircrew stated upon returning that the sight of searchlights piercing the sky, automatic anti-aircraft fire bursting, and high-explosive bombs exploding was spectacular. One pilot stated, 'The firepower was so intense that it seemed like every anti-aircraft gun in Europe was firing.'" (Reuters, 5th)

Paris: The Prime Minister's Office recently issued a communiqué stating that the number of people killed and wounded in the German air raid on the suburbs of Paris on the 2nd of this month is even greater than initially reported. More bodies continue to be found in the rubble, and the number of those who died from their injuries has also increased. The total number of dead and wounded is 906, with 254 dead, including 195 civilians and 59 soldiers, and 652 wounded, including 545 civilians and 107 soldiers. The breakdown by region is as follows: (1) Seine Province, including the Paris city area, had 167 dead, including 121 civilians and 46 soldiers, and 332 wounded, all civilians. (2) Seine-et-Oise Province had 87 dead, including 74 civilians (including 20 children) and 13 soldiers, and 320 wounded, including 213 civilians and 107 soldiers. (Havas, 4th)

### Italian Premier to Deliver Speech Today; Will Present Demands to Britain and France; Italian Cabinet Meeting Official Report Contains No Startling Announcements; French Premier Says Door to Negotiations With Italy Not Closed

London diplomatic sources predict that Mussolini will deliver a speech tomorrow presenting several demands to Britain and France, the nature of which will be absolutely unacceptable to Britain and France. Italy will join the war after Britain and France refuse. The final decision will still depend on the development of the German offensive in the Somme and Aisne river basins in France. (Havas dispatch, 5th)

Rome sources here claimed today that the fact that the communique issued after yesterday's Italian cabinet meeting did not mention the war does not necessarily mean that the decision to participate in the war has been postponed. This is because Mussolini has no obligation to convene the cabinet to approve and announce his decision to participate in the war. It is rumored that Mussolini will deliver a speech to the nation from the balcony of the Palazzo Venezia on Thursday evening. Loudspeakers in major squares are currently being tested for clarity. Today, newspapers published multiple dispatches from Berlin in a special position, stating that Germany appreciates Italy's effectiveness as a non-belligerent country and its benefit to Germany. Many readers then asked why Italy should not maintain its non-belligerent status. However, the newspapers did not reflect such opinions, only stating that participation in the war is inevitable. (Reuters dispatch, 5th)

Rome The official report released by the Italian Cabinet meeting was vague, greatly disappointing those who hoped for stimulation. The impression gained here is that Italy is still awaiting the response of various countries to Italy's final decision being hesitant. The reaction of Britain and France is particularly noted here. Although Italy believes that negotiations have completely broken down after the failure of Britain and France's attempts to avoid Italy's involvement in the war with extreme concessions, it has not yet recognized it as a true diplomatic breakdown. Its intention is to prevent Britain and France from immediately taking hostile actions and to give Britain and France room for redemption. Sources here believe that Italy will first sever diplomatic relations with Britain and France before joining Germany in the war against Britain and France. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 5th)

London Observers here recently said that although the battles in the Flanders region have come to an end, the German army will likely launch a large-scale offensive against France before directly attacking the British mainland. The Italian side will also wait for the arrival of this new offensive before taking any action. Regarding this matter, the cabinet held a meeting yesterday, but the communique released afterward did not contain any startling announcements. It is likely that the issues discussed were more important than those related to administrative matters mentioned in the communique, but they were deliberately kept secret at this time. In short, at this point, Mussolini can decide to participate in the war at any time without warning, but at the same time, he can still temporarily maintain his current attitude, that is, on the one hand, continuously supplying Germany, and on the other hand, keeping a large number of troops stationed by France on the Italian border as a containment measure. As for Switzerland, it is actually under the threat of Germany and Italy. Although Italy has repeatedly provided it with well-intentioned guarantees, this kind of guarantee is no different from the ones it has offered to Greece and Yugoslavia. In any case, Britain must carefully deal with the current situation and intensify its economic warfare, as Italy is economically the most vulnerable. (Havas dispatch, 5th)

Paris French Prime Minister Reynaud made a speech to the Foreign Affairs Committee today, stating that if Italy joins the war, his purpose in doing so is solely to fight. He reviewed the period before and after the outbreak of the war, stating that France had notified Italy that it was willing to start negotiations to seek a friendly solution to various outstanding issues. Although this proposal was not answered, the French government did not mind the attitude taken by the Italian side afterward. France has issued a statement on this, urging the Italian government to pay attention. In the past few days, the French government has obtained the full agreement of the Entente powers and re-initiated this negotiation. Mussolini should know that there is no element of anger in our attitude, and we have never closed, nor are we currently closing, the door to negotiations. (Reuters dispatch, 5th)

Washington According to general opinion, Italy's failure to announce its participation in the war yesterday has something to do with President Roosevelt. Diplomatic circles believe that President Roosevelt has been exchanging telegrams with Rome since two weeks ago, explaining how any changes in Italy's status will change the balance of power of non-belligerent countries. If so, the United States will be affected and will be more inclined towards the Allied powers. It is widely believed that the telegrams also mentioned the issue of Italian immigrants to the United States. (Reuters dispatch, 5th)

Chongqing Chinese sources here are closely watching the possibility of Italy joining the European war. (Reuters dispatch, 5th)

Washington The general consensus now is that Italy's continued maintenance of its non-belligerent status is a sign that the Allied powers' military prospects are more promising than recently. In recent weeks, newspapers have been increasingly critical of Mussolini's rhetoric. (Reuters dispatch, 4th)

### Su Bao Reveals Italy's Ambitions; Southern Country's Political Position Improved After Treaty With Soviet Union

Moscow Soviet newspapers claimed yesterday that Italian newspapers' attacks on Britain and France were purely to cover up Italy's ambitions towards the Balkans, especially Yugoslavia. Yugoslavia's political position has improved since signing a trade agreement with the Soviet Union. Soviet newspapers continued, "Yugoslavia is fully aware of the danger from Italy. Italy may use the situation in the Mediterranean to draw in Yugoslavia, just like other Balkan countries' desire to maintain neutrality and peace. Germany's westward advance has removed or postponed the possibility of Britain and France infringing on the neutrality of the Balkans, but Italy's position threatens to cause serious consequences."

### Churchill Reports on the War Situation; Expresses Determination to Fight to the End (Continued 2); Will Seek Victory at Any Sacrifice; Major Losses Can Be Made Up in a Short Period

Belgian King Betrays Friends

When Belgium had already been invaded, its King Leopold appealed to us for assistance at the last moment. Allied forces immediately went to aid at this time. The Belgian army and its more than 500,000 strong troops guarded the eastern flank of our army and maintained the only route to the sea. Unexpectedly, the Belgian King, without prior consultation, without giving possible notice, and against the advice of his cabinet members, suddenly sent representatives to the German command in his personal capacity and surrendered his army, thereby exposing our entire flank and various safety measures. (Shouts of "Shame") I asked the House to postpone its judgment a week ago because the facts were not yet clear, but today I feel that there is no reason why we should not comment further on this tragic matter. The surrender of the Belgian army forced the British army to cover a flank defense line of more than thirty miles leading to the sea in the shortest possible time. Otherwise, our entire army would have been cut off and would have met the same fate as the brave Belgian army that was sold out by its King.

Allied Forces Fought to Break Through

Since this flank had been cut off, the British army and the French First Army Corps, consisting of two or three army corps further from the coast, were inevitably losing contact. A large number of Allied troops appeared to be in danger of not being able to reach the coast. The enemy was attacking fiercely from all sides with great force. Its main power, namely the air force, which was far superior in number to ours, also joined the war and concentrated on bombing Dunkirk and its beaches. In order to oppress this narrow exit from the east and west, the enemy began to shell the beaches, the only place where ships could stop or leave. The enemy also laid magnetic mines in the straits and on the sea, and sent planes to bomb the only remaining pier and the sand dunes where troops could hide in rotation. Sometimes as many as one hundred enemy planes came at once. The enemy's submarines (one of which has been sunk) and motorboats also engaged in disrupting the large-scale transport that had begun. The fighting has been fierce for four or five days. All the enemy's armored divisions, or rather what remained of them, together with a large number of infantry, fiercely attacked the narrow salient occupied by the British and French troops, all to no avail. At the same time, the British Navy, countless merchant sailors, and a large number of volunteers who volunteered to help (cheers) did their best to enable the British and Allied troops to escape by boarding ships. A total of 220 light warships and more than 650 other ships participated in this operation, all of which had to operate on a difficult terrain and under constant bombardment and concentrated fire, with the sea also full of the danger of mines and torpedoes. Under these conditions, the British Navy and other naval forces worked day and night without rest, repeatedly traveling on dangerous seas, often carrying the rescued troops with them. The amount of troops that have been transported back to Britain shows their efforts and bravery. (Cheers)

330,000 People Escape Danger

Hospital ships transporting thousands of wounded soldiers to safety, all of which were clearly marked, were targeted by Nazi bombing. However, the men and women serving on board continued to perform their duties without fear. (Cheers) The British Air Force also set out from domestic bases to participate in the war as far as their range allowed, and attacked the numerically superior German bombers and fighter planes. At present, the situation there has suddenly become clear, and the deafening sound of explosions has fallen silent. This miraculous evacuation (cheers) was only achieved through bravery, perseverance, perfect discipline, an indomitable spirit of service, resources, skills, and an insurmountable loyalty, as we have all seen. The retreating British and French troops had repelled the enemy and inflicted heavy damage on them, preventing them from seriously disrupting their withdrawal. The British Air Force has defeated the main force of the enemy air force. The losses on both sides are at least one to four, British to German. The Navy, using approximately one thousand ships of various types, transported a total of 335,000 troops (cheers), enabling these British and French troops to escape from danger, return to their homeland, and immediately resume their current work.

Prime Minister's Firm Oath

The Prime Minister then declared that we will never become feeble or fail, we will definitely persevere to the end, we will definitely fight in France and on the oceans, we will definitely fight with increasing confidence and strength in the sky, no matter how great the price, we will definitely defend the island we live on, (great cheers) we will fight on the beaches, fight on the landing grounds, fight in the squares, fight in the streets, fight in the mountains, we will never surrender, (continuous cheers) even if a large part of this island has been conquered or starved to death, our empire, protected by British warships, will continue to fight until, in God's good time, the New World, with all its power, steps out to liberate and rescue this Old World, but I have never believed for a moment that our island would fall into such a dangerous situation.

British Army Suffers 30,000 Casualties

This time, our army suffered a total of 30,000 dead, wounded, and missing, and lost about a thousand cannons. Hitler now occupies all the ports of the Strait. Another blow is about to be inflicted on us or France, and we must prepare to deal with it. The events that occurred in France and Belgium are a great military disaster. The French army has been weakened as a result, and Belgium has been lost. At present, Britain's military strength is stronger than before. The British Empire and the French Republic have united and will defend their countries to the death and will do their best to help each other. King Leopold of Belgium surrendered to Germany without consulting us, disregarding the advice of his cabinet members, and only informing us at the last moment, sacrificing his army and the retreat route of our army. (Great shouts of "Shame") The House can judge his actions for themselves, and I don't need to comment further.

We must be cautious and not regard our army's escape from danger this time as a victory, because war has never been won by withdrawal. (Great shouts of "Attention, attention") However, there is a kind of victory hidden in this escape, and it should be noted. This victory was won by the Air Force. Many of the returning soldiers did not witness the work of the Air Force. They only saw bombers avoiding enemy attacks for self-defense. They underestimate the achievements of the Air Force. Because I often hear this said, I am now making an exception and telling the House about it.

Air Force Fights Bravely

This was a great test of the comparative strength of the British and German air forces. Consider whether the German air power had a greater objective than to make it completely impossible for our army to retreat from the beaches and to sink all of the various ships that were spread across the beaches, numbering almost a thousand. In terms of military importance and military significance in this war, could its objective be greater than this?

The German army worked hard and should have been defeated. The German army's repeated attacks were ineffective. We finally enabled the main force to escape. Although the German army inflicted losses on our army, they were easily obtained at a loss more than four times greater than ours. Very large formations of German planes have scattered in all directions on several occasions to avoid attacks by the Royal Air Force, which numbered only a quarter of their size. On one occasion, two of our planes chased twelve enemy planes. On one occasion, one British plane fired its last remaining bullet and forced an enemy plane into the water, where it disappeared. All of our various types of aircraft and all of our pilots are reliable. The Hurricane, Spitfire, and the newly released Defiant are all better than anything the enemy currently has. When we consider how great the advantages we occupy in defending the skies of this island against attacks from the sea, I must state that I have found a solid foundation in this fact, on which practical and stable thinking can be based. I must praise these young pilots. (Cheers)

I believe that in the entire history of warfare, the opportunities for young people have never been as great as they are today. These young people fly out every morning to defend their country, to defend everything we stand for. These young people wield instruments of immense destructive power, and it can be said that every morning presents them with noble opportunities. These young people deserve our gratitude and deserve to be ranked among the noblest warriors. They are prepared in every way and at many times, and will continue to prepare to sacrifice their lives and everything for their country.

Army Regarded Death as Going Home

I must now say a word about the Army. In many extremely dangerous battles, either on this front or on that front, or fighting on three fronts at the same time, they often bravely resisted enemy forces of the same number or greater in number with two or three divisions. Our losses in soldiers, counting dead, wounded, and missing, have exceeded 30,000. I take this opportunity to express my condolences on behalf of the House to the families of the fallen. The Minister of Commerce is not here today. His son has died on the front lines. Many members of the House must be very saddened by this. I must also say a word of comfort to the families of the missing. A large number of the wounded have now been safely transported back to the country. Many of the missing may return one day. Although we have lost more than 30,000 men, the losses we have inflicted on the enemy are indeed far greater than this number. Our material losses are very heavy. Our losses in manpower are almost a third of what they were in the days when the great battle began on March 21, 1918. However, we have lost about a thousand cannons and all the transportation vehicles and armored vehicles that accompanied the northern army. This loss will further delay the expansion of our army's strength. This expansion has not proceeded as we had hoped. We gave the British Expeditionary Force all the best weapons. Although they did not have a large number of tanks, they had everything they should have, so they can be called a well-equipped army. They have obtained the first fruits of our industry and have now been lost. The continuation of the delay is due to this.

As for how long the delay will be, it depends on the efforts we make on these islands. The efforts that are being made today have never been seen before in our records. Work is being done day and night everywhere, seven days a week, even on Sundays, without rest. Both labor and management have given up their rights and habits and are working together for the country. The number of munitions produced has increased dramatically. There is no reason to say that we cannot make up for the sudden and heavy losses we have suffered in a few months and continue to advance our general program. (To be continued)

Washington Authoritative sources announced last night that the US government has decided to ban the export of machines from the United States. The decision was revealed yesterday because the Counselor of the Japanese Embassy in the United States asked the State Department whether it was considering including the embargo on machines within the scope of the moral embargo implemented against Japan. State Department officials replied that the embargo on machines would be implemented soon, but it would not be included within the scope of the moral embargo. The United States' embargo on machines is due to national defense needs. At least for the time being, it will be implemented equally against all countries. Due to domestic needs, the government had already stopped a portion of machines from being exported abroad. (United Press dispatch, 5th)

Only seven participants registered and were divided into two groups. The top two from each group would advance. The first group had four people. As a result of the draw, Sun Huipai and Guan Youwen were in the same first group. As a result of the competition, Mai Lingjie Cobb led by a shoulder's length. Sun Huipai followed closely behind. Guan Youwen trailed Sun by about five or six yards. When they reached the finish line, because there was no white line, Sun Huipai mistakenly thought he had arrived and stopped automatically. Guan Youwen caught up. He notified Huipai, and Sun once again charged forward. The result was they arrived simultaneously, but Sun was still ahead by a shoulder's length. Unexpectedly, the referee Brown insisted that Guan was ahead of Sun, and Sun Huipai was eliminated. The Chinese United team lost a major general, which was unfortunate.

### Second Ranqing Shield Handball

Sun Jialu Wins Championship
Veteran Hualian Does Not Count Scores

Two New Comets Discovered:

The second Ranqing Shield handball tournament, sponsored by the Chinese Youth Association, concluded successfully the other day after several weeks of competition.

### Commercial News and Finance

Hong Kong Sells Off Foreign Exchange in Large Quantities:

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw HSBC list prices unchanged. The black market for British and American exchange suddenly eased, due to continuous selling pressure from Hong Kong Electric and speculators. With rumors of Italy's entry into the war intensifying, intraday scalpers were scarce, leading to a hardening trend without retracement. Although Bank of America tentatively bought at lower prices, speculators and Hong Kong players aggressively dumped large volumes, creating a loose market. Before the noon close, rumors circulated that HSBC had also sold British gold, with spot transactions reaching 3 pence 79375. However, inquiries with the bank denied this. The closing price was significantly lower than the previous day, with British gold at 3 pence 953125, American exchange at 5.28125 yuan, British gold arbitrage at 140625, and American long at 12875.

Silver balancing tax was revealed to be lower by 2.75 percent. At that time, Hong Kong Electric profitably sold June American exchange to Bank of America at 5.15625 yuan. Shortly thereafter, Japan's Zhengjin Bank aggressively sold to Bank of America, pushing June American exchange higher to 5.1875 yuan. The loosest spot prices were reportedly seen at 5.25 yuan. Subsequently, Bank of America suddenly showed interest in buying June American exchange at 5.12875 yuan, causing a slight retracement. The current price for American exchange is 5.15625 yuan. However, Hong Kong Electric and Chinese merchants and speculators continued to sell heavily, with foreign banks absorbing June American exchange at prices from 5.1875 to 25 yuan. At noon, rumors circulated that HSBC had sold current shillings, with transactions reaching as high as 3 pence 9375. Inquiries with the bank denied this transaction. Closing prices were 3 pence 953125 for British gold, 5.28125 yuan for American exchange, 3 pence 9375 for June British gold, 5.25 yuan for June American exchange, 3 pence 8125 for July British gold, and 5.03125 yuan for July American exchange, loosening spot prices by 140625 for British gold and hardening by 21875 for American exchange compared to the previous close.

Only Japanese gold notes saw slight demand, and the market price rose slightly in the evening to 1.14 yuan. The supply of Korean notes suddenly increased, and the evening price retreated to 0.95 yuan.

### Selling Wind Rises

Gold Prices Plunge
Lowest Seen at 6,060 Yuan

Yesterday's spot gold black market suddenly turned down, with a particularly sharp decline. This was due to the rebound in foreign exchange, triggering a unanimous sell-off by yesterday's long positions. Furthermore, short positions opened at the previous day's high prices took advantage of the situation to aggressively buy back at lower prices, making it easier for prices to fall. The morning began with a drop to 6,208 yuan, a decrease of slightly over 90 yuan from the previous day. Subsequently, gold shop gangs and money changers sold off, further dropping to 6,240 yuan. However, because money changers and securities gangs were buying, prices briefly rose to a high of 6,320 yuan. However, as the exchange market eased, securities gangs sold again, and gold shops and silver shops also sold, retreating to 6,200 yuan. A certain silver shop bought slightly on behalf of the Hong Kong gang, raising prices by dozens of yuan. However, before noon, a massive selling wind rose, with gold shops, securities gangs, and retail investors selling off in unison, plunging to a low of 6,060 yuan.

### Also Low at 6,000

The closing price was also low at 6,060 yuan, a fall of 290 yuan from yesterday, with about 3,000 taels traded in half a day. Gold jewelry shop prices dropped by slightly over 30 yuan. Customs gold and other items remained flat.

### Spot Gold Drops by 290 Yuan

From the beginning of the morning, each bar (10 taels) initially opened lower due to the weakening exchange market and pessimistic sentiment. Gold shops, silver shops, and gangs all came to aggressively sell off, causing a drop of slightly over 90 yuan at the opening. The gold shop sold 30 taels to the money changer for 6,280 yuan. Subsequently, silver shop owners and silver shop gangs tended to sell off long positions, continuing to fall 40 yuan. The silver shop sold 20 taels to the money changer for 6,240 yuan. Then, as foreign exchange rebounded slightly, the selling wind subsided slightly. The gold shop agreed to buy in, and the money changer and a certain securities gang also followed suit, soon rebounding 80 yuan. Securities gangs and money changers each bought 10 taels from the silver shop for 6,320 yuan. Thereafter, the exchange market eased again, and the market trend returned to a downstream direction. The silver shop gang aggressively sold again, and another securities gang began to liquidate long positions made the previous day, immediately dropping 120 yuan. The securities gang sold 30 taels to the silver shop, causing the jewelry shop to sell 20 taels to the silver shop, all for 6,200 yuan. At that time, a certain securities gang added to its long position upon seeing the low price, while the Hong Kong gang slightly bought in, causing a rebound of 50 yuan. The silver shop bought 10 taels each from the jewelry shop gang and fellow traders for 6,250 yuan. Later, as foreign exchange eased further, the selling wind rose again. Gold shops and retail investors competed to sell off. Although the Hong Kong gang saw the low price and bought in more than 100 taels, supply far exceeded demand by several times, and soon dropped 190 yuan. The silver shops mutually traded 30 taels for 6,060 yuan. Near the close, Yu Hao suddenly bought in, raising the price by 20 yuan. The gold shop bought 50 taels from the silver shop for 6,080 yuan, setting the noon closing price. The result was a drop of 290 yuan from the previous day (a rebound after four consecutive days of gains totaling 465 yuan). The first half fell 260 yuan. Cash shop's listed gold selling price was higher than spot by a dozen yuan, and buying in was reduced by 30 yuan. The current standard gold price was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price. Business was slow.

### Gold Jewelry Listed Lower by Slightly Over 30 Yuan

Initially, major gold jewelry shops still listed gold jewelry at 650 yuan per tael, but at 9:30, it was lowered by slightly over 10 yuan. At 10:20, it was lowered again by slightly over 10 yuan. At noon, it was lowered again by slightly over 10 yuan. Thereafter, there was no further change, for a total decrease of slightly over 30 yuan. Major gold jewelry shops changed to 620 yuan.

Also, New York Telegram: The spot price of American silver fell slightly by half a point. To Bombay Telegram: Indian silver alone reported a rise of 4 to 3 annas. The market was flat, with a total of 300 contracts traded, it is said.

### Securities

Domestic Debt Interest Booms
Unified A Exceeds 60 Yuan Mark

In yesterday's securities black market, the trend continued to be firm. For a time, talk of peace was once again rampant. Although unfounded, the market therefore rose. Type A once again exceeded the 61 yuan mark, Type C reached 50 yuan, and Type B also broke through 52 yuan. It can be seen that although credit is tight, the rising trend is unstoppable with any stimulus. Yesterday, the sudden drop in gold further stabilized sentiment. With the Type E lottery draw approaching, sellers were particularly cautious. Type A spot was the scarcest, and the rising trend was the strongest. The trend should continue to rise. Yesterday's trading suddenly became lively. Buying orders were enthusiastic before noon. Tongji bought everything, Renchang bought more and sold less, and Lianyi, Yongkang, Shunkang, Xieda, etc., all absorbed varying amounts. Sellers were relatively few. Hongkang and Jiufeng sold slightly more. Datong and Lianhe also supplied a small number. Type A suddenly broke through 61 yuan, and Types C and E also reached around 50 yuan. The rising trend did not decrease in the afternoon. Type B also rose to over 2 yuan. However, Hongkang and Jiufu continued to sell, while Xinfu, Yongkang, Hongda, etc., bought separately. Lianhe also switched from selling to buying. As a result, the entire day saw a uniform rise, with Type A rising the most by 7 jiao, and the rest also rising by 2 or 3 jiao to 5 jiao and a half. Transactions totaled over 900,000 yuan. A brief summary is listed below:

Category Maximum Minimum Closing Change from Previous Day
Unified A 61.40 60.85 61.20 Up 0.70
Unified B 52.10 51.75 52.10 Up 0.55

London, 4th (Tuesday) Telegram: Today's listed market prices for Chinese foreign debt remained stable. All bonds of the upper and lower tiers saw no change.

### Yarn and Fabric

Bills of Exchange Extended
Yarn Prices Plunge

The yarn market is very weak, and the declining trend is very strong. This is because foreign exchange has slightly increased, and overseas cotton markets have uniformly fallen sharply. Sentiment has softened, and the declining trend has resumed. In fact, the price of a certain yarn is very low, and the distance between it and the local yarn is too far, which has been greatly impacted. New long positions are rather uninteresting. However, a portion is purchasing for the sake of a small amount of Shuangma chips, and the heart has not stopped. In addition, Hong Kong's demand continues unabated.

Now, the opening price of current yarn in the morning is because Indian cotton has plummeted, and the converted compensation is very poor. The American exchange rate, which has been contracting for two days, has risen again, and the wise are once again indifferent. The price of 20-count Shuangma yarn is 1,345 yuan, slightly falling to 1,320 yuan. Subsequently, long positions sold off because of the unfavorable environment, falling another step, closing at 1,310 yuan. It has been found that 1,500 packages were traded in half a day. The price of 20-count Shuangma yarn fell 62 yuan. Today, 1,482 pieces of yarn were transported to Hong Kong. The amount of each gang's purchases is listed as follows:

Fellow Traders 980
Hong Kong 490
Wenzhou 30
Total 1,500
### Indian Cotton Decline is Very Fierce

Local Cotton Transactions Difficult to Improve

There is still no hope for the development of local cotton transactions. This is because the world cotton industry is slightly recovering, and the Indian cotton decline is very fierce, causing sentiment to be even more exhausted. At the same time, the yarn market has fallen again, and bills of exchange have been extended, making the market softer. The transaction prices of current cotton are listed below:

Mittel Ring 292.00 Fellow Traders bought 100 pieces
Mittel Ring 300.00 Qingdao gang bought 200 pieces
Oomra 206.00 Fellow Traders bought 100 pieces

Another report says that the market price of foreign cotton, the New York cotton market is quiet and unusually small. The market declined as a result of selling by spot merchants and the settlement of a portion of long positions. The closing price fell 3-4 pounds from the previous day. The Indian cotton market also fell 10 rupees yesterday, along with the forecast.

Shanghai's foreign cotton transactions are particularly sluggish. Although the Tianjin gang has slightly increased its appetite, it is only slightly robust. Intentions among colleagues are quite high, but they are ultimately troubled by the lack of improvement in transactions. The following are the prices of cotton in the Shanghai market yesterday converted at an exchange rate of 5.1875 yuan to US dollars:

20 count US Mittel Ring 423.95
20 count US Mittel Ring Lower Grade 422.80
32 count US Mittel Ring 345.10
32 count US Mittel Ring Lower Grade 334.00
42 count US Mittel Ring 347.20
42 count US Mittel Ring Lower Grade 336.10

### Grains

Foreign Rice Traders Rush to Sell
Market Shows a Downward Spiral
Glutinous Rice Also Declines

Since the rice market initially tightened and then weakened the day before, it has been weak throughout yesterday morning. As a result, the price of foreign rice has fallen by about 1.5 yuan. Since market changes have been drastic recently, people become anxious at the slightest setback. Moreover, the Dragon Boat Festival is approaching, and credit is tightening daily. In addition, there are rumors on the market that a large number of foreign rice orders have been placed and will be shipped to Shanghai from Hong Kong, which has reduced the only outlet to the countryside. The local shops rarely show interest. Transactions throughout the city have suddenly become scarce. At the same time, speculators have turned from buying to selling, and sellers are seeking to quickly sell. As a result, recalled funds and original goods are flooded, and the market is in a state of imbalance between supply and demand. With you throwing and I dropping, the market trend shows a declining and depressed trend.

Foreign rice prices have been declining all the way. The whole city has slightly reduced the amount of rice still in transit. The decline in rice prices is particularly severe, because local gangs are all stuck, and it is rumored that rice prices in Hangzhou have fallen by 3-4 yuan. Local merchants are returning to the market to sell. In addition to Siam's slightly reduced transactions, He Yi Foreign Firm also threw out 1,500 tons of Siam No. 2 for delivery in the second half of June at a price of 59.9 jiao. Jian Yuan threw out 4,000 tons at a price of 59.5 jiao, and there is hope that the firm order will be confirmed by telegram this morning. People's hearts are empty and soft, and the desire to sell is particularly strong. Floating speculators are all competing to sell. The morning closing price of each type of rice has fallen by 1-2 yuan. After a period of hovering, the afternoon continued to decline. The slightly reduced amount of reduced rice fell into 50 yuan. After opening at a minimum of 49.5 yuan, buyers only offered 49 yuan. Siam No. 2 was also lowered to 50 yuan, and Saigon No. 2 was lowered to 51 yuan, which is 3-4 yuan different from the highest price the day before. The evening closing price rebounded slightly, but was still about 2 yuan lower than the previous evening's closing price, it is said.

During this period of foreign rice price decline, glutinous rice also saw its outlet decline, and all prices fell by 0.5 yuan. Jinyin special glutinous rice opened at 46.5-46 yuan, Changdan white glutinous rice opened at 44.5 yuan, and Jiangbei white glutinous rice opened at 43 yuan.

National rice such as thick and thin Japonica rice has still not arrived, and it is rumored that there are few transactions in the off-market trading. However, because there is no source of supply, merchants' minds are still quite firm. Therefore, except for Zhen Special Japonica rice, which was overly boosted in the past and has too high prices, lacking interest, and has fallen by about 1 yuan, other ordinary goods can stand firm. Changgang Special Qing Japonica rice is around 58 yuan, Changgang Kun Japonica rice is 56-7 yuan, sub-quality goods are 95 yuan, and Nangang early rice is 55.5-55 yuan. There is a lack of thin rice, so there is no market.

### Flour

Customer Sales Continue
Customer Price Has Reached 16 Yuan
Kunshan New Wheat Has Arrived in Shanghai

Flour: Yesterday's flour market saw only the usual retail sales in the local market, while customer sales and local gangs' purchases both continued. It is reported that the customer price for green cannon cars purchased by the Northern Ocean gang has reached a new high of 16 yuan. The selling price of Tianzhu Fisherman and other brands purchased by the Southern Ocean gang is also close to 16 yuan. However, the price of the No. 2 flour mill's panel is still 13.8 yuan, but it is only limited to supply domestic sales. Approximately 1 Yu Bao was traded in the unified market, half of which was purchased by local and customer customers. Old car brand recalled goods saw both supply and demand silent. Local miscellaneous brand flour also saw both inventory and arrival depleted, holding steady. Prices for brands such as Shunfeng Brand are roughly the same as local mill prices. The market situation is quietly firm.

Wheat: Yesterday's wheat market still saw little trading. It was found that new wheat has already been launched in various places, such as Kunshan, Suzhou, Changzhou, Danyang, etc. The local production price is approximately 31-2 yuan per shi (old grain container) of 174 jin, plus fees, totaling approximately 22 yuan per 100 jin in Shanghai. However, the new goods vary in quality, and selling prices vary greatly. It is reported that new goods on the Pudong side are currently only 15-16 yuan per 100 jin, which have not been dried. But all have been obstructed by a certain party, and cannot be transported to Shanghai for the time being. As for the rumors that Japanese merchants have transported several carts of Changzhou wheat to Shanghai, the market has denied them, saying that they are not formal grain merchants' transactions. It is reported that wheat merchants and flour mills are appealing to all parties to dredge transportation methods, but there is still no adequate solution.

Additional Report: Yesterday, more than 20 bags of new wheat were transported from Nanjing, rumored to be Kunshan goods, transported to Shanghai by a certain merchant in cooperation, but not yet put on sale. However, there is no news of this in the miscellaneous grains market. It is only reported that the wheat source problem is expected to be resolved.

### Coal

Coal Briquettes Increase by 10 Yuan
7.7 Yuan Per Dan

Coal briquette prices, due to competition among traders in the previous week, factory prices had fallen to a low of 132 yuan. Yesterday, because the shilling shrank again, a decision was made at a public meeting that from today (5th), all traders will uniformly add 10 yuan, for Southern Ocean Guohua and Yitai coal briquettes, 142 yuan per ton for self-collection, with additional cartage for delivery. Retail in local street shops will be 5 jiao per dan, for a selling price of 7.7 yuan, it is said.

### White Coal Also Increases

The white coal business, although the market is quiet due to seasonal factors, the cargo owners took advantage of the current tightening of the exchange market, and yesterday traders increased prices by 10 yuan, the Hongji White Coal Warehouse priced each ton of standard goods at 216 yuan, small at 214 yuan, and ash at 212 yuan, and Haicai White Coal priced each ton at 220 yuan, all prices for self-collection by traders, with additional fees for delivery to customers, and a discretionary charge of about 10 yuan.

### Miscellaneous Grains

New Broad Bean Prices High and Sales Dull
Soybeans Have Also Turned Down

Today, 235 pieces of export piece goods were transported to Hong Kong, and another 282 pieces were transported to Haiphong.

### Sugar Market

Coarse White Plummets 3 Yuan

### Ambassador Hu Shih Delivers a Speech: China Will Defeat Japan; Time is the Key to Victory; Deeply Aware of Japan's Economic Collapse

San Francisco. Dr. Hu Shih, the Chinese Ambassador to the United States, delivered a speech yesterday at the prestigious California Company's Commercial Club here, stating that China would defeat Japan because time is the key to victory. "We are currently trading Japan's space for time, and as a result, time will bring us victory." Hu Shih, the Provost of Peking University, a great Chinese philosopher and scholar, and previously one of the world's leading pacifists, has become a military observer since the Japanese invasion of Manchuria. He said, "In today's world, force is a necessity for defense." Hu Shih continued, "By achieving victory, I do not mean that we can crush the Japanese army with continuous military victories. I mean that we will win when our enemy is finally exhausted, economically, financially, and militarily. The longer we fight, the more our confidence increases, and the weaker the enemy becomes. Our army of three million men is larger than at any time during the past thirty-two months of war against Japan. Our scholars and graduate students have developed hundreds of substitutes for essential military raw materials. We are determined to continue fighting. We can fight for another five, ten, or more years, but the Japanese cannot." The Chinese are well aware that the Japanese are exhausted economically, financially, and militarily. The cost of the war in China for Japan is greater than the cost to the United States in the First World War. "In the past three years, Japan has shipped US$580,000,000 worth of gold to the United States to purchase military raw materials, and the country's gold reserves are now on the verge of exhaustion." While China is becoming stronger, Japan is becoming weaker. It is now experiencing a shortage of cotton, rice, gasoline, kerosene, coal, milk, copper, iron, timber, cement, calcium carbide, electricity, and water. Japan is implementing a rationing system for beverages. Hu Shih continued, "China is deeply aware that Japan's economy is on the verge of collapse, so it is determined to continue resisting until a truly just and honorable peace is achieved. However, such a peace has not yet appeared. We may need five or ten years. This is the estimated timeframe by Japanese experts for Japan to end. China will definitely face this period.” Hu greatly regretted the Japanese people, because "the military has seized all the fruits of Japan's modernization over the past sixty years." He said, "We must win a victory that will make the Japanese military regime realize that violence will never lead to good results and will inevitably fail. Only this kind of understanding can lead us to a just and lasting peace. The current war in Europe is just one stage of the Second World War. This world war began in 1931 when Japan forcibly invaded the Northeast. A few years ago, when we said that the war in China was the first stage of the Second World War, no one believed it. In the past nine years, the war in China, the invasion of Abyssinia, the events in Spain, the seizure of Austria, and the subjugation of Czechoslovakia and Poland, are all just 'parts' of this same world war." Dr. Hu Shih said that the root cause of this world war is "the result of the collapse of the international order." People who are peaceful and unprepared militarily are subjected to aggression and bullying by military nations. "If a true and lasting peace cannot be achieved in the Far East, there will be no world peace." (United Press dispatch, 5th)

### The Background of the European War: An Account of the German Humiliation (6)

— Abridged translation of Sir Nevile Henderson's original work

Goering was very active all day long. But these matters depended on Hitler alone, and Goering merely obeyed. At five o'clock in the afternoon, I was invited to see Goering, because I knew that the other side's conditions would be announced by radio at that time. I immediately told Goering that this move would probably make reconciliation hopeless and asked him to stop it. Goering replied that he could not do anything about it, and that the German government had to announce its demands to the world to show its sincerity. He spoke eloquently for two hours, strongly criticizing Poland's wrongdoings, and saying how Hitler and he hoped to be on good terms with England. This may have been his last attempt to alienate England and Poland, but he was indeed sincere in hoping for reconciliation.

The meeting between Polish Ambassador Lipski and Ribbentrop was fruitless. Lipski said that he was only talking as an ambassador and had no full power to negotiate. After speaking, he handed Ribbentrop a letter stating that the Polish government accepted the British government's proposal and was willing to negotiate directly with Germany. A formal reply to the German demands would be given soon. But when he asked what the German proposal was, Ribbentrop did not present it. The meeting between the two only lasted a few minutes before they broke up. The Polish ambassador wanted to call Warsaw again, but he could not get through. Hitler had already chosen the time to send troops and had no intention of negotiating directly with Poland.

At dawn on September 1, the German army crossed the border and invaded Poland. That evening, England and France jointly issued an ultimatum to Berlin, which was also rejected. The situation took a sharp turn for the worse, and there was no way to save it. Finally, at eleven o'clock in the morning on September 3, England and France declared war on Germany, and it was out of control. I returned to the embassy after meeting Ribbentrop at noon and did not leave the house. The next morning, the American chargé d'affaires, Kirk, drove me to the station. Before that, in the last twenty-four hours, I still walked or rode in a car with the British flag freely through the streets of Berlin. In short, in the weeks leading up to this dangerous situation, until the last moment when we lowered our flag and returned home, neither I nor my staff were humiliated, and the Germans had no animosity. This was completely different from the eve of the Great War in August 1914.

From what I could gather, the German people were all afraid of war. This was certainly the case in Berlin, but I did not know what the German youth and the German army going to Poland were like. After the German army attacked Poland, in order to observe the attitude of the German people, I went to the Berlin streets on the most Saturday and Sunday afternoon of my term. I happened to go into a pharmacy to buy "codeine" medicine. The pharmacist looked very unhappy and said that he could not sell it without a doctor's prescription. I told him that I was the British ambassador. He apologized again and said that the drug sales regulations could not be violated. I replied, "You probably don't understand, I'm the ambassador. If I take this medicine and die from poisoning, Goebbels and his ilk will award you a special honor." This was a joke, but the man seemed pleasantly surprised and immediately took out "codeine" and gave it to me. It was very sad.

The same anecdote occurred when I left the embassy with Mr. Kirk for the last time. The reason was that it was "encircling Germany" or "provoking war." But if those people were dimly.

On Sunday afternoon at two o'clock, I and my party finally crossed the German border into the Netherlands. At seven o'clock, we arrived in Rotterdam and were warmly received by the British Minister to the Netherlands, Sir Bland. We stayed overnight at the British Embassy.

At this point, we were only waiting to take a neutral ship back to our country. At dawn on Thursday, we set sail on the Dutch ship Batavia. As soon as we boarded the ship, we suddenly saw three British destroyers coming to escort us. We were overjoyed. The Batavia sailed out of Dutch territorial waters, and the two ships sailed on either side to cover us, with one ship leading the way. Everyone who saw it was moved. Halfway through the voyage, we were all having dinner in the lower cabin when the ship was suddenly shaken by three consecutive explosions of depth charges. The three bombs were fired by the lead ship three nautical miles away. The ship then returned, and I sent a telegram asking. A hundred yards from the hall and the intersection, there was a policeman standing guard to direct traffic. In the past, when I passed through that place, the traffic police would always salute. But this morning, when the policeman saw me, he turned his head and looked the other way, as if he was concentrating on directing traffic. It was as if he could no longer salute me, but he did not want to pretend not to see me. Examining his psychology, "like others, those who started and ended the peaceful, certainly have no malice."

On Saturday morning, I and my staff, thirteen men and seven women, along with two dogs, left the embassy. About ten people gathered outside the embassy, watching me and my suitcases being loaded into military vehicles, and there was complete silence. There were about ten plainclothes policemen mixed in, perhaps wishing that those people would scold England to reveal military secrets. I told my staff that when we reached the national border, if the customs authorities asked, they could answer, "We sank a German submarine."

In May, when the national border was in sight, the escort ships left the Dutch ship and returned to defense, and my journey also came to an end. After entering the port, the two dogs we brought were taken away for quarantine. We landed at about seven o'clock in the afternoon. There were no stevedores at the pier, so the staff carried their suitcases onto the train. That night, at about eight o'clock, we finally arrived at London Victoria Station. From Berlin to London, it took one day and eight hours. My mission to Germany came to an end, but I had already failed in my mission. (The End)

### The People of Hang, Lake, and Jia Recognize Personality

Jiaxing Correspondence. The anti-Japanese awareness of the people in the Hangjiahu area has become increasingly widespread recently. In addition to the active mobile units in China, there is also a "Non-Slave Education Group" that takes Hangjiahu as its central area to convey the true meaning of anti-Japanese resistance and make it deeply rooted in the hearts of every individual. This group has witnessed the current general pretense and general situation, with both truth and falsehood, which cannot be clearly distinguished by the untrained eye. Therefore, strange phenomena such as "Double Packages," "Five-Flower Holes," and "True and False Li Kui" are openly staged. These people act like petty merchants and counterfeit goods, which is hateful. Therefore, all those who strive to save the people and save the country must first abandon their long-held views, ideas, policies, and doctrines, and then review them after the anti-Japanese issue has been resolved. Therefore, the most important thing at present is to unify the consciousness of the whole people. In short, taking "not being a slave" as the basic condition for unifying consciousness, the group has widely distributed the theory of "Recognizing the Significance of the War of Personality" in the Hangjiahu area as an instruction for unifying the consciousness of the people. It is true that respecting one's personality is a sign of not being a slave. The theory is recorded as follows: "Among the hundreds of types of human beings in the world, the most tragically abused are slaves. In the name of being human, the most shameful and the most painful in their hearts are slaves. Those who enslave others do not treat them as human beings, but as cattle and horses, or even worse than cattle and horses. If the spirituality and knowledge of cattle and horses are not as good as humans, they can endure being whipped and flogged, but sometimes they are overworked, and those who raise them may show some pity and be unwilling to whip them again. However, the methods used against slaves are cruel, vicious, and unscrupulous, as if they are afraid that they will not die soon enough, and that they will not be exterminated completely. Alas, this is a kind of indirect means of destroying a country and exterminating a race. Alas, how terrible! However, those of our people who have not sworn not to be slaves must first be made to recognize the significance of the war of personality in order to preserve their own personality and not be misled. Otherwise, a blind man riding a blind horse and approaching a deep pool in the middle of the night is in an unimaginable danger. If they fall by accident one day and think of struggling to get out, it will be as difficult as climbing to the sky. The people of Taiwan and Goryeo are not far away as a warning. May our people also be vigilant! The Non-Slave Education Group."

### Japanese Troops in Northern Jiangsu Invade Xingtai

Taixian Correspondence. Japanese troops in northern Jiangsu have recently been on the move again. One route has been reinforced from Gaoyou, invading Sanwang, Hekou, and all the way to Tangjiazhuang, attempting to occupy Laoge, threaten Xinghua, and cut off the connection between Xing (hua) and Tai (xian). After the troops engaged the bandits in a fierce battle, the Japanese army suffered heavy casualties, captured Sanwang, and were surrounded by the Chinese army. It will not be difficult to annihilate them. Although many residents of Xinghua have been evacuated, the area is still peaceful. In addition, the Japanese troops at Daqiao again invaded Wujiaqiao. After the Chinese troops in Jiangnan and Lianghuai launched a large-scale counterattack, they captured many. At 6 p.m. on the 21st, a Japanese warship sailed from the downstream and anchored at Hekou. More than 200 infantry and more than 100 cavalry of the Japanese and puppet troops at Daqiao immediately boarded the ship and sailed downstream. At the same time, they set up heavy artillery at the north of Qinglong Bridge and the west of Daqiao, patrolling the town every day and forcing residents to obtain "Good Citizen Certificates" before they were allowed to pass through. Now Taixian is also quiet and peaceful as usual because the Japanese army is far away.

### Training National Teachers in Various Provinces and Cities (2)

(18) When various provinces and cities plan to train national education teachers, the allocation of various types of normal schools (departments), classes, advanced training classes, and short-term training classes must ensure that the percentage of qualified education in each district increases year by year. By the end of the third phase of national education implementation, the number of qualified teachers should reach at least 60 percent.

(19) When various provinces and cities plan the training of national education teachers, they must conduct a thorough investigation of the number of graduates and the enrollment situation of primary schools, junior high schools, senior high schools, normal schools, simple normal schools, and vocational schools in the most recent three to five years, and list them year by year, as a reference for talent recruitment and distribution.

(20) When various provinces and cities plan the training of national education teachers, regarding the supplementary examination of unqualified teachers, in addition to those who have passed the examination in advanced training classes or training classes, the calculation standard for additional training should be 25 percent of the total number of unqualified personnel.

(21) When various provinces and cities plan the training of national education teachers, the number of elderly, retired, and resigned personnel should be investigated and the statistics of recent years should be used to find the proportion to the total number of current teachers as a standard for estimating the number of supplements to be. If it is impossible to obtain this statistic, the number of resignations should be based on one-fifth of the total number of teachers.

(22) When various provinces and cities plan the training of national education teachers, they should designate one or several normal schools to handle the training of teachers in kindergarten, art, work, music, physical education, Boy Scouts, social education, and other subjects, taking into account the needs.

(23) The funds required for training national education teachers in various provinces and cities should be raised by the provinces themselves, but the Ministry of Education may provide subsidies in the first to fourth years when each province and city begins to implement national education.

(24) In order to encourage outstanding students to enter normal schools, various provinces and cities should immediately set up scholarships for outstanding normal school students from poor families, with a standard of 60 yuan per year per student. Those who are awarded scholarships through competitive examinations before entering school and those who are awarded scholarships based on their grades and family circumstances after entering school should each account for half of the number. The distribution of quotas should be 3/5 for simple normal school students and 2/5 each for normal school students and other normal school students.

(25) The principals of various types of normal schools in various provinces and cities, or the staff of other national education teacher training institutions, may be transferred by the Ministry of Education in conjunction with the Ministry of Interior and the Central Training Corps for training for a considerable period of time. The method of transfer will be stipulated separately. (The End)
