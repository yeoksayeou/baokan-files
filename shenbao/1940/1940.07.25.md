Editorial

### After Konoe's Inauguration in Japan

It is reported that after the inauguration of the Japanese Konoe Cabinet, the first order regarding the military operations against China was to withdraw the naval forces attacking the coastal areas of Ningbo and Santu'ao in China and concentrate them in Taiwan and Hainan Island, awaiting further orders. It is also claimed that after Britain rejected Germany's proposal for a negotiated peace, the secret diplomatic relations between Germany, Italy, Japan, and Spain seem to have made rapid progress. It is said that Germany and Italy are urging Japan and Spain to join the war against Britain as soon as possible, as Germany and Italy most want to use the Japanese navy not only to disrupt British influence in the Far East but also to divert American attention from Europe. Therefore, observers generally believe that Japan's recent withdrawal of its navy from the Chinese coast is another gesture of Japan's preparation to participate in the European war. This is a dispatch from Hong Kong. Whether it is based on facts remains to be judged. However, according to Japan's recent situation, the Hong Kong report, while not necessarily a statement of facts, is an observation that is not far from reasonable.

It took Konoe six days to organize a cabinet after resigning from Minai, and it was only yesterday that he held a private ceremony and announced his inauguration. Since taking office, Konoe has not made any systematic positive statements regarding his policy guidelines, as of the time of this report. The questions and answers between Konoe and the press corps recorded in yesterday's newspaper are only fragmentary and insufficient to understand the general outline of his policies. Regarding foreign policy, what he said was even more superficial and unfounded. The so-called seeking an effective solution to the China Incident, the so-called adjusting relations with Germany, Italy, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, and the so-called urgently seeking to get rid of the historical dependence on Britain and the United States, and so on, are as empty as zero. Of course, we do not believe that Konoe's aspirations are almost equal to zero. However, there were various remote and recent reasons for Minai's resignation this time, and the fact that the army suddenly expressed that it would no longer continue to cooperate, forcing the Minai cabinet to resign immediately, is undeniably abrupt in its actions and momentum. Therefore, although Konoe has lofty aspirations and thorough planning, his sudden acceptance of the order to form a cabinet is undeniably premature in terms of timing and preparation. The slow cabinet formation and the superficial remarks are all signs of prematurity!

The premature Konoe cabinet faces numerous difficulties it is currently encountering. Since it does not have a well-thought-out plan, how can we expect it to be decisive in its command? As the Hong Kong dispatch reports, it is unbelievable that the withdrawal of the Japanese navy from Ningbo and Santu'ao is a strategic move under Konoe's policy. Foreign Minister Matsuoka has only just taken office and has not yet begun to take action internationally. It is again unconvincing to say that the secret diplomatic relations between Germany, Italy, Japan, and Spain seem to have made rapid progress. The withdrawal of the navy from the Chinese coast and concentration on Taiwan and Hainan Island is probably a fact. Before any positive statements are made on the international stage, this fact alone is insufficient to be regarded as an effective gesture of preparing to participate in the European war. Therefore, upon examination, the Hong Kong dispatch is merely an observation rather than a report.

Then, how can we see that such an observation is not far from reasonable? Looking at Konoe's intentions: one is that he definitely wants to quickly resolve the so-called China Incident. Therefore, in various offensives, he inevitably aspires to make rapid progress. To seek effectiveness, he will at the same time abandon what is unnecessary and correct what is ineffective. Therefore, the partial abandonment of military occupation points and lines is inevitable. Two is that he definitely wants to gain something from this European war period. Therefore, towards Germany, Italy, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, he will definitely reverse the previous diplomatic stance. He will strive to be strong and will also not hesitate to make any kind of concessions. The so-called another gesture of preparing to participate in the European war is a representation that will inevitably be embellished as much as possible, but its central consciousness still aspires to achieve success through this representation alone. As for the actual participation in the European war, it is a matter to be reconsidered after diplomacy has completely failed and is definitely not what is being discussed today at the beginning of Konoe's rise to power. Three is that he definitely regrets that within his country, for the past three years of the invasion of China, the authority has been inconsistent, and there have been many obstacles. Therefore, he aspires to merge into one party and concentrate power in one entity, so that major undertakings can be carried out easily. Is the so-called new political system really a problem of the system itself? From pressing aspirations to making realistic plans, this is where the outline of Konoe's ambitions lies. We do not despise such ambitions, but we understand that the people who have presided over the national administration in Japan in recent years have successively been defeated and resigned, not because of a lack of subjective ambition but because of a lack of objective conditions for realizing their ambitions. The so-called objective conditions are not in Konoe's pocket!

### The United States Will Adopt a Positive Stance on the Far East; Vinson Urges Congress to Consider Preliminary Work for Fortifying Guam

Washington: A responsible member of the US Congress recently told a reporter from the Associated Press that the United States may immediately adopt a positive stance on the Far East issue and the anti-American incident in Shanghai. On the other hand, many members of Congress, wanting the United States to concentrate its efforts on building national defense to resist aggression, do not seem to want the US relationship with the Far East to become serious. The consideration given by congressional and government leaders to the Far East diplomatic situation due to the recent Shanghai incident also does not indicate that the United States will adopt a special attitude or action towards the Far East. However, the US government's attitude towards the Far East at this time is clearly different from the time four months ago when the US administration seemed to want to ease relations with Japan, and is tending towards a more proactive aspect. Japan's reorganization of its cabinet and its clear trend towards totalitarianism have greatly changed the US Congress's attitude towards Japan. The overall situation may come to a head during the debate on the Guam fortification proposal at the next congressional meeting. Well-informed congressional members said that Representative Vinson, chairman of the House Naval Affairs Committee, said yesterday that the US Navy intends to raise various improvement issues at the next congressional meeting. It is also reported in political circles that the Navy is currently planning to carry out various improvements to its defenses and the construction of Guam in order to expand the use of Guam. (Associated Press dispatch of the 23rd)

Washington: Representative Vinson, chairman of the House Naval Affairs Committee, declared yesterday that he hoped that the administration would present the preliminary work of considering the fortification of Guam at the next meeting. Vinson's announcement has attracted attention here, as it is believed that the matter will be discussed in the current meeting without any significant delay. A Navy spokesman has notified Congress that the fortification of Guam, 1,300 miles southeast of Japan, is an important military step in US Pacific defenses. However, Congress has repeatedly opposed this proposal, which has been criticized by the Japanese Navy Department. Vinson declared yesterday that he expects the proposal to cause a great debate in Congress. Minnesota Republican Representative Maas told the House Military Affairs Committee that he believes the committee should immediately hear the proposal. Maas said, "If we wait until the next meeting to discuss this proposal, we may need to obtain permission from Japan." (Associated Press dispatch of the 24th)

Washington: The United States is currently brewing a secret movement to legally restrict new policies so that they cannot manipulate the new national defense expenditure of 14 billion US dollars for political purposes. According to a visit by an International News Service reporter, the movement has been initiated by Democratic senators who oppose Roosevelt's third term. When the last unexpected defense fund of 4.8 billion US dollars in the big defense expenditure is sent to the Senate for discussion, the above movement may be made public.

Chongqing: According to Chinese sources, when the Japanese troops landed in Zhenhai and on both banks of the Yong River in an attempt to occupy Ningbo, there were only two divisions of Chinese troops defending the Ningbo area. The Chinese military authorities immediately requisitioned all public buses, trucks, and cars on the highways south of the Yangtze River to transport reinforcements to the Ningbo area. Notices were posted at various bus stations stating, "Due to a shortage of gasoline, public buses are temporarily suspended." In fact, these vehicles were all used to transport troops. They were able to reach Ningbo in time because of continuous travel day and night. Due to the Chinese counterattack, the Japanese troops were driven back to their warships. It is expected that the public buses on all highways will soon return to their original condition. (Reuters dispatch of the 24th)

### Widespread Rumors that Song Ziwen Will Remain in the United States Temporarily

Chongqing: Although Song Ziwen and Chen Guangfu are the most popular candidates for Minister of Economic Warfare, it is uncertain whether the ministry will be established in the short term. It is rumored that Song Ziwen will remain in Washington and succeed Hu Shi as the US ambassador.

### Transfer of Archives by Shanghai Municipal Council; Further Protests from External Sources

Chongqing – It was previously reported that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had protested against the Shanghai Municipal Council, which was planning to hand over archives formerly entrusted to it by the Shanghai Municipal Government's Land Bureau, to the puppet regime. It is now reported that the transfer of these archives has already been implemented. As a result, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has once again lodged a serious protest with the embassies of relevant countries, stating that the Shanghai Municipal Council, in possessing these archives, was entrusted by the Shanghai Municipal Government. Therefore, it should only return the archives to the entrusting party and must not transfer them to any other organization, especially not to the puppet Shanghai Municipal Council. This action is illegal and not only greatly affects the rights of Chinese and foreign merchants and residents in Shanghai, but also betrays the responsibility of safekeeping entrusted by the Chinese government. It is also stated that the aforementioned transfer of archives has no legal effect, and the Chinese government reserves all rights concerning this matter. (24th dispatch)

### Circuit Court System; Implemented in Seven Provinces; Cases Tried and Concluded Promptly for the Convenience of the People

Chongqing – Since the Judicial Yuan issued an order to the higher courts of various provinces to implement the wartime circuit court system, reports have been received successively. It is estimated that seven provinces have implemented the system, including Hubei, Guangdong, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Anhui, Henan, and Zhejiang. (Shanxi Province is divided into ten districts, but the implementation date has been repeatedly postponed due to the fact that the appointed circuit trial judges have not yet arrived). The jurisdictional areas of the circuit courts in each province are as follows: Hubei is divided into four districts, Guangdong into two districts, Jiangsu into six districts, Jiangxi into two districts, Anhui into two districts, Henan into three districts, and Shanghai is one district. The duration of each circuit in each district is determined by the size of the area and the ease of transportation, ranging from one month to three months.

### New Changes on the Map of Europe; United States Will Refuse to Recognize; Welles Condemns Soviet Tactics; Says Intent is to Annihilate the Three Baltic States

Washington – Acting Secretary of State Welles yesterday strongly condemned the Soviet Union's absorption of the three small Baltic states of Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania, and stated that the United States will refuse to recognize the new changes on the map of Europe. Welles also criticized the use of aggression or threats of force to achieve national goals, and stated that unless all countries return to the basis of peace and the rule of law, culture cannot be preserved. "In the past few days, the political independence and territorial integrity of the three small Baltic states have been intentionally annihilated in a deliberate manner by one of the strongest neighbors of these three countries. This process will be completed quickly. When the people of these three republics first gained independence and democracy, the American people watched the admirable progress of their self-governance with deep sympathy. The policy of this country is well known to the world. The American people oppose acts of plunder, whether carried out by force or threats of force. The American people also oppose any powerful country interfering in the internal affairs of any small, independent country. These principles are the foundation of the relations between the twenty-one independent republics of the New World (referring to North and South America). The United States government has consistently adhered to these principles, because the American people deeply believe that unless these principles can be consistently adhered to, there will be no reasonable, fair, and lawful rule, in other words, the foundation of modern culture cannot be preserved." (24th Reuters dispatch)

Washington – Yesterday, the United States condemned the Soviet Union's recent annexation of Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania, believing that this was a wrong method and a threat of force used by the Soviet side to eliminate the three Baltic republics. Just as the Russian spokesperson in London proposed holding a tripartite meeting of Britain, Russia, and the United States to resist Japan's expansion of power in the Far East, Undersecretary of State Welles was launching a fierce attack on aggression. Officials stated that Welles' remarks, approved by President Roosevelt, would be a sign that Russia and the United States would not be able to cooperate in Asia or elsewhere. Welles also took the opportunity to warn the Spanish government not to use the break in relations with Chile as an excuse to interfere in any republic in the Americas. (24th International dispatch)

Washington – Welles' comments condemning the Soviet Union's absorption of the three Baltic states surprised political observers here, as it was generally believed that US-Soviet relations had gradually improved, as evidenced by the recent US approval of the shipment of machinery and other equipment to the Soviet Union. It is believed that Welles must have consulted with President Roosevelt before making these remarks, but it is unclear whether he informed Hull. (24th Reuters dispatch)

Washington – Welles, in his capacity as acting Secretary of State, made a formal statement in the press briefing room, condemning the Soviet Union's absorption of Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania as an act of intentional annihilation. He stated that although the three countries had voted to join the Soviet Union, the United States would continue to recognize the ambassadors of the three countries to the United States as envoys of independent governments now under duress. The assets of the three countries in the United States, totaling 970,000 US dollars, have now been placed under a license system of the US Treasury Department to prevent possible confiscation. (24th Reuters dispatch)

London – British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax yesterday received protests from the ambassadors to Britain of Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania against the unanimous vote of the Communist parliaments of the three countries to incorporate them into the Soviet Union. The protest notes were similarly worded. The ambassadors of the three countries stated that they would refuse to recognize the actions of the new Communist parliaments, and stated that the incorporation of their countries into the Soviet Union was solely due to the threat of foreign military occupation. The ambassadors' notes requested the British government not to recognize the merger of the Baltic states with the Soviet Union. The notes also cited various treaties in which the Soviet Union guaranteed the independence of the three countries. Lord Halifax agreed to reply to the ambassadors after the cabinet had studied the notes. Observers here believe that while the British Foreign Secretary expressed personal sympathy for the fate of the three countries, the ambassadors' actions would put Britain in a delicate position. The general demand here is to strengthen British-Soviet relations and weaken Berlin-Moscow relations. The ambassadors of the three countries stated that they hoped to enjoy the same status as the exiled governments of Poland, the Netherlands, Norway, and Czechoslovakia. Unofficial sources suggested last night that Britain would not recognize the incorporation of the three Baltic states into the Soviet Union, but doubted that Britain would grant any legal status to the embassies of the three exiled Baltic states.

### Soviet Newspaper Commentary on the Annexation of the Three Countries

Moscow – The Pravda newspaper commented that the resolution passed by the parliaments of Lithuania, Estonia, and Latvia to establish Soviet regimes and request the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union to incorporate each country into the Soviet Union, this resolution of the democratic representatives of the Baltic countries, truly represents the voices of the people of the three countries. Their common will has been expressed in the general election. They unanimously voted in favor of establishing Soviet regimes and rejoining the great Soviet Union. This can be confirmed by the mass rallies held in the three countries. The enthusiasm shown by the people of the three Baltic countries in the general election was unprecedented, and it was also the first time they could freely express their opinions. The people of the Baltic countries have freely decided their future destiny. They only had two options: one was to continue to be shackled by capitalism, and the other was to establish Soviet regimes. They have now made their final decision. The Soviet regime and socialism have won. The reasons why the people of the Baltic countries are willing to establish Soviet-style governments are: (1) Only the Soviet regime can guarantee national friendship and unity; (2) The Soviet regime represents the national policy of Lenin and Stalin; (3) Only the Soviet Union can free the working masses from unemployment and starvation; (4) Only the Soviet regime can unite all nations, develop the economy, and consolidate national defense. The people of the three countries demand the establishment of Soviet regimes and annexation to the Soviet Union. The people of the three countries now understand that their new governments truly represent the people. They have had painful experience with the corruption of the former governments. A new page has been opened in the history of the Baltic countries. The darkness of the past has been completely eliminated. Capitalist politicians, with the help of British bayonets, have transformed the three countries into bases for attacking the Soviet Union and began a fierce anti-Soviet movement. Imperialist lackeys such as Smetona only cared about their own interests and disregarded the future of the country. Therefore, the Baltic countries became even more impoverished and became backward countries in Europe. Dishonest petty-bourgeois politicians have done everything in their power to keep their countries away from the Soviet Union. They are extremely afraid of the news of the victory of socialist construction. They have used rumors and corrupt newspapers to spread unfounded rumors about the Soviet Union, but to no avail. The people of the Baltic countries have paid close attention to everything about the Soviet Union. Their love for the socialist country is profound. In oppression, their concept of building a Soviet regime has become even deeper. They have always remembered Lenin and Stalin, and at the same time firmly believe that only the Soviet Union is the true guarantee for small countries. When the Red Army entered, this sentiment was fully exposed. What they saw was not only representatives of the great Soviet Union, but also advanced elements who had received socialist culture. Therefore, their impression of the Soviet Union was even better. They believe that Soviet life is a new life, and the Soviet government is a new people's government. Everything that is most beneficial to the people is confirmed by the great Stalin Constitution. A glorious future has been determined. The people of the three countries will join hands with the people of the Soviet Union and move towards this goal together. So far, the great historical task has been completed. The people of the three countries have placed their future destiny in their own hands. They have expelled imperialist enslavement, overthrown the capitalist parasites who oppress the people, and at the same time returned the land to the people. More importantly, they have destroyed the bases of war and safeguarded the peace of their countries. The people of the Soviet Union unanimously welcome the emergence of these new Soviet republics. The borders of the Soviet Union have been further expanded, and the dawn of the Stalin Constitution has spread to new lands and new nations. This has strengthened the strength of our motherland. The Soviet Union warmly welcomes the resolutions of the parliaments of the three countries. Yesterday, at mass rallies, the people of the Soviet Union unanimously expressed their love for these new Soviet republics. At the same time, they are particularly satisfied with the victory of socialism and the wise policies of the Soviet government. They will always be loyal to Comrade Stalin, because Stalin's name is the power of communism. The people of the Soviet Union are very willing to help these new Soviet republics to get rid of the darkness of the past and build a socialist industry, culture, and a new life for the working masses. With the help of the Soviet Union, the talents of the three countries can be fully developed. They must understand the broad benefits of the Stalin Constitution for the masses. In these historically valuable days, the Stalin Constitution has proven its great power. The anniversary of November 25, 1936, will be forever etched in the hearts of people around the world. As Comrade Stalin said, "This document will prove that whatever the Soviet Union can achieve, other countries can also achieve." Today, we see that this achievement has been achieved by the Baltic Republics. Under the protection of the Stalin Constitution, the Soviet nation has become increasingly strong. The working masses of the world will certainly rejoice over this. (23rd TASS dispatch)

### New Latvian Government Prepares to Accuse Former President

Stockholm – A traveler said that the new Latvian government will publicly accuse former President Ulmanis. In a recent demonstration in Riga, there was a motorcade with an empty coffin on which was written "Prepared for Ulmanis." Posters were pasted everywhere saying, "The dictator (referring to Ulmanis) robbed the people for six years." (24th Haitong dispatch)

### Pan-American Conference to Discuss Economic Cooperation Proposals; Joint Management Plan for Territories in the Western Hemisphere; Argentina Declares It Will Oppose

New York – According to the New York Times correspondent in Washington, an organization capable of rising up and accepting any territory in the Americas belonging to a European country, if it attempts to transfer it to a non-American country, is rapidly taking shape. This issue will be the main subject of discussion at the Pan-American Conference. The signs are becoming increasingly clear that a draft of joint temporary management measures has been prepared as a basis for discussion. Countries such as Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, or Brazil will hesitate to impose restrictions on the fully authorized management, because the United States will inevitably control this action in the future if it is implemented. Therefore, several suggestions have been added to the current draft in order to alleviate this kind of concern. (24th Reuters dispatch)

Havana – Argentina recently declared that it will oppose the collective management plan of the Pan-American Conference. This plan is to establish a collective management system by the American republics to manage European territories in the Western Hemisphere and prevent the intrusion of omnipotent forces into the Americas. This plan was proposed by the Peace Maintenance Committee of the Pan-American Conference, which is composed of representatives from Brazil, Venezuela, Panama, Ecuador, and Paraguay, and US Secretary of State Hull is the chairman of the committee.

(Five Points of the Plan)

The content of the plan is to organize a "Five-Nation Committee" to manage the French and Dutch territories in the Western Hemisphere, and includes the following main points: (1) The American countries reiterate that they do not recognize any military conquest in the Western Hemisphere, and do not recognize any direct or indirect transfer of sovereignty; (2) The American countries will engage in determining whether any change in the political status of any Western Hemisphere territory occupied since September 1, 1939, affects the independence, freedom, and activities of that territory; (3) If the American countries must take action to deal with these territories, the significance of this action is not an attempt by the American countries to expand their territory; (4) The American countries may return these territories under their management to their original rulers when they deem that it will not affect the security of the Americas. If these territories have the ability to self-govern, they should be allowed to declare independence; (5) When the American countries must take over these territories, they should be managed by a committee composed of the United States, Cuba, Colombia, Venezuela, and Brazil. This committee may request the use of force to manage these lands if necessary. Two hours after Hull discussed with the Argentine representative, Podolmiro, it was heard that Argentina expressed opposition to this collective management plan, but has not yet put forward an equivalent plan. However, it is rumored that a plan is expected to be put forward this week.

(Secret Meeting Held Today)

In addition, there has been no disagreement on issues such as neutrality, prevention of sabotage activities, and economic cooperation. The first public report of the meeting stated that various plans to accelerate the work of the meeting were passed by only one vote. The case that all proposals must be submitted by noon on July 25 was passed by eleven votes to ten votes. The first secret plenary meeting will be held at 5 p.m. tomorrow, and the second public plenary meeting will be held at 4 p.m. on Saturday at the request of Colombia. The Peace Maintenance Committee has voted a vote of confidence in Hull, so Hull will work with the Secretary-General of the Conference, Cuban representative Saraya, to deploy the proposals to be studied by various committees. The communiqué also stated that US Assistant Secretary of State Berle has provided a draft resolution on economic cooperation, which may be submitted for discussion at the meeting.

(Bolivia Suggests Alliance)

According to reliable non-Bolivian sources, the Bolivian representative is drafting a resolution on the defense of the American continent. It is heard that the continental defense bill drafted by the Bolivian representative stipulates close cooperation between the American countries, and its nature is nothing less than an alliance of the American countries. However, reliable sources say that this draft resolution may only become a resolution in form. The Colombian representative stated that any international agreement in the Americas on continental defense should take the form of a convention and must be ratified by the parliaments of various countries. However, according to the most reliable authorities here, the participants in the Havana Conference are not prepared to take this progressive and active action. Well-informed sources also pointed out that the development of this defense issue into an action in the form of a convention cannot be realized because the naval and military experts of various countries are not present.

### Prime Minister Konoe's Broadcast Address on Policy Guidelines

Hong Kong – Tokyo report, Prime Minister Konoe delivered a broadcast address last night, stating that the army and navy and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have reached a complete consensus and are determined to devote themselves to the realization of the "New Political System." There are two evils of political parties: one is that the purpose of establishing the party is to adopt liberalism, democracy, or socialism, and its fundamental worldview and outlook on life are incompatible with the national polity; the second is that the purpose of political parties is mainly to compete for political power, and it is not the way to legislate to assist in major policies. These two evils must be eliminated. The cabinet's policies are as follows: (1) In terms of diplomacy, it is necessary to adopt an independent diplomacy based on Japan's independent position, but it should not only adopt a passive attitude, purely to cope with changes in the world situation, but should occupy a leading position and actively build world order. Therefore, foreign policy should not only be unaffected by the world situation, but also have a long-term vision of ten, twenty, or even fifty years later, and should always move forward autonomously, actively, and constructively; (2) In terms of economy, in order to strongly realize the above-mentioned diplomatic national policy, it is necessary to quickly get rid of the weakness of dependence on foreign countries. The economic cooperation between China, Japan, and Manchuria, and the development of the South Seas are extremely important. In the future, there may be cases where there is a shortage of materials and supplies are not smooth. The government will do its best to ensure the necessities of the people's lives. All citizens should abandon selfishness, increase production and save resources. Government budgets should also be reduced as much as possible and redundant expenses should be saved. However, it is necessary to implement various controls on the private sector, and it is hoped that the people will unanimously obey; (3) In order to adapt to the situation and overcome major difficulties, national education will also be refreshed, etc. (24th dispatch)

Hong Kong – Tokyo report, the Emperor summoned the new Minister of Agriculture and Forestry, Tadatsugu Ishiguro, to the palace this afternoon to hold an imperial appointment ceremony. At the same time, Konoe resigned from his concurrent position as Minister of Agriculture and Forestry. It is reported that Ishiguro flew back to Tokyo from the puppet Manchuria on the 22nd.

### Reports of Soviet Ultimatum to Finland Demanding Disarmament Denied by Finnish Officials; Finnish Troops Withdraw from Åland Islands

Stockholm – According to reliable private sources received here last night, Finland has received an ultimatum from the Soviet Union demanding the complete disarmament of Finnish forces. It is said that the ultimatum was delivered to Finland several days ago, and the demobilization of the Finnish army is already underway. It is widely believed that several generals from the Finnish General Staff, including Chief of Security Franke Kuhl, have arrived here because Finland accepted the ultimatum. (Reuter, 24th)

Helsinki – The Finnish government issued a communiqué yesterday stating that the garrison on the Åland Islands is currently withdrawing. The first troop transport ships have already left the islands. It is said that the Soviet Union had requested Finland to withdraw its garrison from the Åland Islands. Following a League of Nations arbitration in 1921, the islands were ordered to be demilitarized. In 1930, an agreement signed by Finland and Sweden partially abolished the demilitarization regulations. (Haitong News Agency, 24th)

Helsinki – Foreign newspapers reported that the Soviet Union had delivered an ultimatum to the Finnish government, making various demands (such as the demobilization of Finnish troops). However, official documents here deny this, stating that the Finnish government is unaware of any ultimatum from the Soviet Union. (Haitong News Agency, 24th)

Stockholm – American residents in the Nordic countries, except for diplomatic and consular personnel, will be evacuated immediately and return to the United States. According to well-informed sources, an American ship will sail to the Nordic region, approximately docking at the Finnish port of Petsamo, to transport American expatriates back home. The belligerent nations have guaranteed the safety of this refugee ship. (Haitong News Agency, 24th)

### Germany Invites Romanian and Bulgarian Authorities to a Meeting in Salzburg; Before Launching a Major Offensive Against the British Isles, the Axis Powers Seek to Resolve Outstanding Issues Among the Balkan Countries

Berlin – The German government announced last night that senior officials from the Romanian and Bulgarian governments, at the invitation of the German government, will arrive in Germany at the end of this week for a "short visit." Informed sources believe that the meeting will take place in Salzburg. The Romanian officials invited to the meeting include Prime Minister Gigurtu and Foreign Minister Manoilescu. The Bulgarian officials invited include Prime Minister Filov and Foreign Minister Popov. Some neutral observers here believe that the holding of this Salzburg meeting indicates that Führer Hitler is not yet prepared to begin his blitzkrieg against England. Germany and the Soviet Union have apparently not reached a compromise on the future status of the Balkans, and the various outstanding issues among the Balkan countries have not been resolved. Some quarters here believe that Hitler will not launch a major offensive against Britain until he secures the Balkans. (Reuter, 24th)

Rome – Romanian Prime Minister Gigurtu and Foreign Minister Manoilescu plan to depart for Salzburg tonight. The Swedish Minister to Romania, Fabrizius, and three officials from the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, including the Director of Foreign Intelligence of the Romanian Propaganda Ministry, will accompany the Romanian Prime Minister. (Haitong News Agency, 24th)

Sofia – Bulgarian Prime Minister Filov and Foreign Minister Popov may depart tomorrow afternoon. Secretary-General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Shishmanov, and the legal expert of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Bornakov, and Secretary-General of the Ministry of Interior, Gantchev, will accompany them. (Haitong News Agency, 24th)

Sofia – Concerning the report from German radio in Taiwan that the Bulgarian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister will visit Germany at the invitation of the German government at the end of this week, people here are paying close attention. Political figures believe that Bulgaria's demands for territorial revision will certainly be one of the issues discussed in the upcoming talks. Especially considering that before the Bulgarian Foreign Minister and Prime Minister arrive in Germany, German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop has already decided to meet with Romanian representatives in Salzburg, it seems undoubtedly that Germany will assist Bulgaria in presenting its territorial revision demands to Romania. (Haitong News Agency, 24th)

Capital of a Southern Country – The fact that authorities from Romania and Bulgaria are going to Germany at the invitation of the German government to hold a meeting with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop has attracted considerable attention from political figures here. It is generally believed that Germany will facilitate a peaceful resolution of the Romanian-Bulgarian border issue regarding Dobruja. Subsequently, the same type of intervention will be applied to the Romanian-Hungarian border issue. (Haitong News Agency, 24th)

Bucharest – Although Romanian Prime Minister Gigurtu and Foreign Minister Manoilescu, who are invited to Salzburg on Friday, are expected to have dinner and talks with Hitler, they will depart for Bucharest that evening. It is generally speculated that their talks will discuss Hungary's demands for border revisions. Well-informed sources are watching the outcome of the discussions with great anxiety, and it is believed that the issue of Outer Transylvania will definitely be raised. The nature of the Hungarian newspapers and radio broadcasts has angered Romania. The Bucharest newspaper Basarabia even published an article on Sunday criticizing the Romanian government's policies, which has greatly surprised the Romanian side. A certain radio station in Budapest stated that the Hungarian minority in Outer Transylvania is being mistreated, and said, "Romania's fate is now sealed." Political figures here are still confused about the division of interests between the Soviet Union and Germany in the Balkan Peninsula. It is generally believed that Germany has temporarily placed Romania under the Soviet sphere of influence. However, news directly from Berlin states that Hitler now wants to clarify the situation in the southeast before starting the attack on Britain. It appears that there will be little territorial cession, and there will be strong resistance. (Reuter, 24th)

Bucharest – Since the news of Germany inviting senior Romanian officials to Salzburg for an important meeting regarding the future of the Balkans was released, Germany and the Soviet Union seemed to intensify their efforts last night, both trying to "save" Romania. According to reliable reports, German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop is seeking an understanding with the Romanian leaders regarding German and Soviet interests in Romania in the Balkans. At the same time, well-informed sources claim that former Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu will leave here within days for Moscow to fulfill some important mission. Diplomatic circles here believe that the Soviet Union intends to make further demands on Romania, and it is unknown whether these demands can align with Berlin's plans in the Balkans. Recently, well-informed sources claimed that Romania believes that if Germany and the Soviet Union are determined to cooperate in the Balkans, then Romania will be at the mercy of these two countries. However, there was no indication here last night that the Soviet Union and Germany had consulted with each other regarding the German-Romanian meeting in Salzburg. Romanian officials expressed confidence last night, saying that the result of the Salzburg meeting is that Germany will not demand Romania to sacrifice more land. The explanation of the Romanian Prime Minister's visit to Salzburg by informed sources here is that Germany only wants to gain an understanding regarding the future status of the Romanian government. Some quarters believe that the Salzburg meeting is a means to prevent the Soviet Union from further advancing in the southeast. (Reuter, 21st)

### Soviet Union Denies Reports of Forcing Romania to Reorganize Government; News Is Completely Groundless

Moscow – Recently, foreign newspapers have spread the following rumors about Soviet foreign policy: (1) The Soviet Union allows airplanes to "supply Britain," and Britain has spent 200 million pounds on this matter. (2) In the next few days, the Soviet Union will begin negotiations with Turkey to sign a trade agreement, stipulating that the total trade volume between the two countries will be increased to 12 million Turkish lira. (3) The Soviet Union has delivered an ultimatum to the Romanian government, demanding the establishment of a democratic government, stating that without such a democratic government, it is impossible to establish friendly relations between the two countries. TASS has recently been officially authorized to declare that the above rumors are completely unfounded and absolutely inaccurate. (TASS, 24th)

### Deteriorating Relations Between Britain and Romania; Romania Recalls Envoy to Britain

Rome – "Il Popolo d'Italia" recently carried a telegram from Bucharest stating that the Romanian government has recalled its envoy to Britain. The newspaper also claimed that political circles have confirmed that Romania's recall of the envoy is directly related to the hostile attitude recently expressed by the British Embassy in Romania.

### Britain Officially Recognizes Czech Provisional Government; President Beneš Issues Statement, Continuing to Unite with Britain to Fight for Freedom

London – The Czech Provisional Government has been organized and established here. The list of members is as follows:

President Beneš, Prime Minister Šrámek, Minister of National Defense General Ingr, Foreign Minister Masaryk, Finance Minister Outrata, Interior Minister Slávik, Minister of Social Affairs Nečas, Ministers without Portfolio Fierlinger, Jan Stránský, Štefan Osuský.

President Beneš also issued a statement to the press, emphasizing that the Czech people and the British people share the same ideals and interests. In the future, the Czech Provisional Government and the Provisional Parliament will strive for "democracy." (Havas, 24th)

London – Prime Minister Churchill recently announced in the House of Commons that the government has officially recognized the "Czech Provisional Government" organized by former Czech President Beneš in our country and maintains friendly relations with it. In addition, Foreign Secretary Halifax recently sent a letter to President Beneš, officially notifying him of this intention. Political figures here have commented on this matter, saying that the government's action is to recognize this provisional government as an administrative agency for the Czech people to assist our country in resisting German aggression. In the future, the people of the two countries will work together to defeat the common enemy. As for the legal status enjoyed by the Czech Provisional Government, it is the same as that of other allied governments organized in our country. (Havas, 23rd)

### Norwegian Parliament Under German Control; Norwegian Government in Britain States It Can Never Represent Public Opinion

London – Regarding the plan of the Norwegian Parliament, recently meeting in Norway, to make the Norwegian King abdicate, abolish the Norwegian government, and establish a "National Council" under German control in Norway, the Norwegian government in Britain recently sent a letter signed by Prime Minister Nygaardsvold to the Presidium of the Norwegian Parliament, stating that the Norwegian government's views are completely consistent with the views expressed by King Haakon in his letter to the Presidium on July 3. That is, when the parliament meets in Norway, which is occupied by foreign troops, it cannot truly represent the wishes of the Norwegian people. The idea of establishing a government colluding with Germany, and achieving peace, is a fantasy. (Reuter, 24th)

### British House of Lords Holds Secret Meeting to Discuss Foreign Policy

London – The House of Lords met this afternoon and held a secret meeting to discuss the government's foreign policy. (Reuter, 24th)

London – A rumor is currently circulating in various neutral countries, spread by what is ostensibly a fair source from Germany, that Lloyd George and the Duke of Windsor are currently jointly engaged in a peace movement. This rumor is completely unfounded and can be definitively denied. However, given the very clear expressions in the recent speeches of the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary, it is considered unnecessary to continue to issue formal denials regarding the peace movement. (Reuter, 24th)

### Amidst Military Turmoil, Hitler Takes His Time; Attends Theater in Bayreuth

Bayreuth – Yesterday, when the German newspapers responded to the British Foreign Secretary's speech with the headline "The Die Is Cast, Britain Chooses War," Hitler leisurely made a trip to Bayreuth. Hitler attended the performance of a famous opera in the theater, which was crowded with his soldiers and workers. Wounded soldiers, makeshift soldiers, armory workers, and frontline workers who traveled from various places to Bayreuth at Hitler's invitation all cheered enthusiastically for Hitler. At the entrance of the theater, Wagner and German leader Dr. Ley welcomed Hitler. After the end of the play, Hitler left Bayreuth. (Haitong News Agency, 24th)

### Britain Levies High Income Tax to Cover War Expenses; Third Budget Approved by House of Commons; Average Daily Military Expenditure Exceeds Eight Million Pounds

Stockholm – After a fierce debate on the Third War Budget, the British House of Commons passed the budget proposed by Chancellor of the Exchequer Sir Kingsley Wood last night. (Haitong News Agency, 24th)

London – Chancellor of the Exchequer Wood presented the budget in the House of Commons last night, announcing that Britain's war expenses have greatly increased, from 40 million pounds per week in April to the current 57 million pounds per week. In order to cope with this huge war expenditure, tax rates cannot be further increased, so: (1) The standard rate of income tax is increased to 8 shillings and 6 pence per pound. (2) Income tax surcharges are increased according to income level. (3) Property tax is increased by 10%. (4) Beer tax is increased by 1 penny per pint. (5) Tobacco tax is increased by 2 shillings per pound. (6) Light wine tax is increased from 5 shillings and 11 pence per gallon to 8 shillings, and strong wine tax is increased from 12 shillings to 16 shillings. (7) Entertainment tax is also appropriately increased. The Chancellor said that the previously proposed purchase tax plan will now be withdrawn, but many items will be taxed appropriately at the time of purchase. All food and beverages are exempt from purchase tax, and fuel, gas, electricity, water, and children's clothing and shoes are also exempt from tax. Machinery and equipment needed by farmers, as well as certain medicines and supplies, are also exempt from tax. According to this new chapter, the purchase of luxury goods and non-essential items, such as furs, silk goods, lace, porcelain, ceramics, cosmetics, etc., will be subject to high taxes, one-third of the wholesale price and 24% of the retail price. The purchase of other items, such as clothing, household appliances, books, and newspapers, will be taxed at a lower rate, one-sixth of the wholesale price and 12% of the retail price. The purchase tax will reduce the revenue of the Ministry of Finance compared to the original proposal, but it can still generate about 110 million pounds per year. Now that the standard rate of income tax has been increased to 8 shillings and 6 pence, the Chancellor intends to modify the tax rate for the first 160 pounds of income of taxpayers. Currently, this tax is half of the standard rate. According to the standard rate of 8 shillings and 6 pence, it should be increased to 4 shillings and 3 pence per pound, but he proposed to increase this tax to 5 shillings per pound. A married man with two children earning 400 pounds previously paid 11 pounds, 17 shillings, and 6 pence in tax, and will now pay 15 pounds, 15 shillings, and 8 pence. Those with an income of 1,000 pounds per year will now have to pay 210 pounds and 10 shillings, instead of 180 pounds, 6 shillings, and 3 pence. According to statistics, the increase in income tax can generate 84 million pounds per year, and 60 million pounds can be obtained this year. The Chancellor then announced the increase in income tax surcharges, saying that for those with an income exceeding 2,000 pounds, the surcharge will increase from 1 shilling and 3 pence per pound to 2 shillings. Higher incomes will be taxed more heavily. Those with an income exceeding 20,000 pounds will be levied a surcharge of 9 shillings and 6 pence per pound. All those with an annual income exceeding 20,000 pounds will have 9/10 of the excess income taken by the state. It is estimated that this increase can generate 11 million pounds per year, and 8 million pounds can be obtained this year. It is estimated that after the increase in income tax and surcharges, a total of 639,000,000 pounds can be obtained throughout the year, compared to 290,000,000 pounds five years ago. Income tax has always been paid in two installments, once every six months. Now, however, all wage earners, from laborers to company managers, will have the tax deducted monthly or weekly from their salaries. The Chancellor then stated that the property tax will be increased by 1/10 again, which can generate 6 million pounds per year, and 1 million pounds can be obtained this year. The beer tax will be increased by 1 penny per pint, which can generate an additional 13 million pounds per year, and 7.5 million pounds can be obtained this year. The tobacco tax will be increased by 2 shillings per pound, which can generate an additional 9 million pounds per year, and 6 million pounds can be obtained this year. The wine tax will be increased from tomorrow, with light wine increasing by 2 shillings and 1 penny per gallon to 8 shillings, and strong wine increasing by 4 shillings to 16 shillings, so that tax revenue can also be increased. As for wines from autonomous regions and colonies, they will still be given preferential treatment. Entertainment tax will also have to be increased, which is estimated to generate an additional 4 million pounds per year. All of these direct and indirect tax increases can generate an additional 86 million pounds this year, and 129 million pounds can be obtained throughout the year. He believed that the repeated taxation of individual expenses must be a necessary part of the current financial proposal. The current budget stipulates an additional tax of 239 million pounds throughout the year, plus the budget of 128 million pounds that increased taxes in April, so the total tax increase in the past three months is 367 million pounds, excluding the 40 million pounds for excess profits tax.

The Chancellor also said that over 300 million pounds of 3% war bonds have been raised, and 250 million pounds of savings certificates and defense bonds have also been sold, and 110 million pounds of 1.5% new war bonds have also been subscribed. All of these achievements have made him confident that the work of making up for the revenue shortfall is not insurmountable. The current financial problems are indeed numerous and difficult, but they are by no means insurmountable. We have abundant resources, and our determination and ability to actively use these resources are beyond doubt. The importance of national finance is no different from the battlefield. We must continue to advance here, sparing no sacrifice until victory is achieved. The Chancellor also stated that the budget of 200 million pounds for war expenses this year, which was set in April, was previously explained as only a speculative figure under the current situation. The reason for estimating 200 million pounds was based on an average weekly war expenditure of 40 million pounds. Recently, the weekly expenditure has increased to 57 million pounds, so the revised estimate of war expenses this year is 180 million pounds, and the revised estimate of the excess of expenditures over income will be close to 220 million pounds. The difference is indeed terrifying, but not enough to make people panic. In order to cope with overseas payments, we can use foreign resources in three main ways: (1) Selling government-owned gold overseas. (2) Selling foreign bonds that the government purchased from the people at home. (3) Autonomous regions and India do not use all of the payments for British goods, but leave a part in Britain as short-term investments. The government intends to limit the ordinary supply to retailers, which can enable manufacturers to maintain and, where possible, expand export trade. We must recognize that export trade is an extremely important part of the war effort. The collection of direct and indirect taxes at the highest possible tax rates is obviously necessary, but it cannot be achieved overnight and must be done gradually. Therefore, this budget can only be regarded as a temporary budget. Smith, speaking on behalf of the Labor Party, said that the increased expenses are evidence of the government's increased efforts and increased production of war equipment. He believed that the Chancellor can levy taxes to the extreme that humans can tolerate. No other country has assumed the responsibilities as heavily as Britain will in the coming months. He expected the people to be willing to bear this responsibility and accept the sacrifices that were not considered a few months ago. Liberal Party Harris also said that the people are prepared to bear this heavy burden, because otherwise they will become slaves. (Reuter, 24th)

### German Air Force Launches Major Attack on Britain; Britain Retaliates Against Germany; Thick Smoke Soars Where Wings Pass; Krupp Factory Bombed Again

In the twilight, it was heard that German planes were approaching from the North Sea, and it was expected that a major bombing was about to begin. The German bombing began after the British Ministry of Aviation announced that the British Air Force had bombed German military and industrial facilities again, inflicting heavy damage, and bombed northern Germany and its occupied areas on the continent.

The aircraft storage depot in Baden-Baden was bombed and exploded violently, with thick black smoke rising. The Gelsenkirchen oil refinery was attacked. British aircraft dropped bombs, and a huge explosion occurred two minutes later. However, the bombing results were not clearly visible because the line of sight was obstructed by floating clouds. According to reports from other British aircraft, the buildings there were burning fiercely, and thick smoke was soaring, proving that the attack was successful. At the same time, other British aircraft attacked the Essen oil refinery and the Krupp armaments factory, as well as airfields in northern France and Germany, the Amsterdam dockyard and gas depots, and ships in the port of Dunkirk. Only two British aircraft did not return. Yesterday afternoon, British Air Force fighter jets shot down a German bomber off the northeast coast of Scotland. (Reuter, 23rd)

Chongqing - Chiang Ting-fu and his party from the Hunan, Jiangxi, Fujian, Guangdong, and Guangxi group of the Political Inspection Team returned to Chongqing from Guiyang on the evening of the 22nd after completing their inspection of the respective provinces. They are scheduled to visit President Chiang within a few days to report. He recently told a reporter from the Central News Agency that they traveled through seven provinces, covering more than 7,500 kilometers, for a period of two months and one week. In addition to inspecting the provinces, they also inspected 61 county governments and central and local agencies in the same locations. The impressions gained were very good. The most interesting and gratifying to the people of the country were about three aspects: First, the living standards of the people across the country have improved consistently, and the rural areas are particularly becoming more prosperous. This is due to the general increase in productivity in recent years, which shows the deep economic potential of the Chinese nation. Second, the provinces all feel a lack of talent in areas such as education, forestry, water conservancy, and hygiene. The provinces are making great efforts to develop institutions and add civil servants. In terms of quantity, the provinces have already achieved considerable results, but in terms of quality, there is still much room for improvement. Third, most provincial governments are able to govern diligently, and civil servants in general are able to work hard without complaining about the hardships of life. The atmosphere in the political circles of the country has indeed undergone a positive transformation. (Telegram, 23rd)

### 戢止恐怖暴行　領事團今日集會　意義重在中外一致矚目　傳局方已提出措置方案

Curbing Terrorist Atrocities: Consular Body Meeting Today; Significance Lies in the Universal Attention from Chinese and Foreign Parties; It is Rumored that the Bureau Has Proposed Measures

K.J. McEuen, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement, recently, due to the repeated occurrence of terrorist atrocities in the settlement, especially after the bombing of the Shen Bao newspaper and the assassination of Zhang Sixu, Director of the Great American Printing Company, the Chinese and foreigners were shocked and deeply concerned about the future of security in the Shanghai International Settlement. Therefore, on the 19th of this month (last Saturday), he wrote to Hill, the Danish Consul-General and Dean of the Consular Corps, urging him to convene a consular meeting to discuss ways to maintain security. This was accepted by Hill, the Dean of the Consular Corps, who separately notified the consuls of various countries. The meeting was originally scheduled to be held on Monday of this week (the 22nd of this month), but was postponed to today (the 25th) at 3:30 pm because the Japanese Consul-General Miura cited a lack of time. The nature of the meeting is of great significance and is watched by all parties, Chinese and foreign. A reporter from the Pooming News Agency inquired about this matter with foreign parties yesterday. It is learned that today's Consular Corps meeting will be held in the Board of Directors meeting room of the Shanghai Municipal Council, and the Shanghai Municipal Council has begun preparations yesterday. It is rumored that the authorities of the International Settlement seem to have submitted various measures to the Consular Corps to maintain security, requesting cooperation and support. According to well-informed sources, it is believed that after today's Consular Corps meeting, the Shanghai Municipal Council will immediately implement effective measures to prevent terrorist atrocities.

America Watching the Situation in Shanghai

Washington, 24th (United Press) - U.S. government officials stated that the United States is closely monitoring the situation in Shanghai, and said that for any actions taken by Nanjing against the American people, the United States will demand responsibility from Japan. Acting Secretary of State Welles claimed that he knew that several American news correspondents stationed in Shanghai had telegraphed President Roosevelt to report on incidents of personal attacks and threats of violence against them. He was not aware that the White House had received the telegram. Welles declined to comment on the Shanghai telegrams, believing that the government would not issue any statement until President Roosevelt agreed to criticize. However, officials stated that the U.S. government is closely monitoring the situation in Shanghai, and they indicated that a protest has been lodged with the Japanese authorities regarding the case of Mr. Aborn, the Shanghai correspondent of the New York Times. It is recalled that Mr. Aborn reported to the American Consul in Shanghai, Mr. Bottorff, that his residence was broken into by two armed Japanese, who forced him to hand over the draft of a biography of a certain celebrity that he had been writing for nine months. Officials did not specifically criticize this, but their impression last night was that the United States might demand responsibility from Japan for this incident, as in the past incidents encountered by American citizens in "Manchukuo."

Japanese Spokesman Tries to Explain

The Japanese Embassy spokesman, Ken, stated at a reception for reporters last night, regarding the telegram sent by the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai to Washington on Tuesday (23rd), that the idea that there is an anti-American sentiment in this city seems to be unfounded. It seems to be entirely a coincidence that so many incidents have occurred between Americans and Japanese in this area in a short period of time. The spokesman argued that the incidents that have occurred should be judged separately on their own merits. Journalists must maintain a calm attitude.

Aborn Incident Still Under Investigation

The Japanese Embassy spokesman also announced at a reception for reporters last night that regarding the incident in which American journalist Aborn was assaulted by Japanese thugs in the Broadway Mansions last Sunday, the reports made by various parties give the impression that the Japanese authorities were the instigators of this case. The spokesman insisted that this case must be treated as an ordinary criminal assault case, as if a Japanese reporter were assaulted in New York under the same circumstances. The spokesman continued that the Japanese authorities have not yet been able to issue a statement regarding the investigation of this case.

The English-language Ta Mei Evening Post reports that the British authorities have issued measures for British overseas Chinese to enlist in the British army, which are divided into two plans. The first plan is applicable to men aged 21 to 38. This group of British overseas Chinese can join the British regular army and first serve in British Malaya, but there is no guarantee that their service will be limited to British Malaya. The second plan is applicable to men aged 19 to 30, who can join the Indian Army. Single British overseas Chinese aged 19 to 30 can be assigned to the infantry, while those between 25 and 50, whether married or not, can be assigned to the engineering corps.

Navigation to Various Blockaded Ports in Fujian and Zhejiang is Extremely Difficult; Although Zhenhai Has Been Recaptured, Resumption of Navigation Still Awaits; Ships to Wenzhou and Ou Encounter Obstacles

The Shanghai-Ningbo route has been interrupted since the Japanese navy announced the blockade of the Zhejiang coastal ports on the 16th of this month. On that day, the four ships scheduled to travel from Shanghai to Ningbo, including the Ruita, Changde, Avima Lee, and Jiangsu (which was opening to Ningbo for the first time), all temporarily suspended their voyages to Ningbo. Passenger tickets sold by each ship have also been refunded one after another, and the goods loaded are also undergoing customs clearance and unloading procedures. The goods loaded by the Ruita, a vessel of the Wah Lun Shipping Company, began to be unloaded yesterday. According to news from the shipping industry, although Zhenhai has been completely recovered, the resumption of navigation between Shanghai and Ningbo may still have to wait.

Polly and Falcon Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday

The Polly of the Italian Yihua Shipping Company and the Falcon of the Lulin Shipping Company, which operate the Shanghai-Wenzhou route, left Wenzhou for Shanghai on the morning of the 22nd after the Japanese side announced the blockade of the coast. When sailing to the Yanpan waters outside the mouth of the Oujiang River, they were suddenly detained by a Japanese warship, which sent a boat to board the ship for inspection. They were also "warned" by the Italian shipowner that "no ships are allowed to sail in the military action area" along the coast of Zhejiang and Fujian. They were only released at about 5:00 pm. On the way, they encountered a hurricane and only returned to Shanghai at 2:30 pm yesterday. The Falcon also arrived at the same time. The two ships were loaded with a small number of goods and a batch of mail. They will now be temporarily docked in Shanghai, pending the outcome of negotiations before deciding on their next course of action.

New Great and Haiyi Detained and Not Released

The Portuguese New Great, which operates the Shanghai-Ou route, and the German Haiyi, which operates the Shanghai-Lihang route, have not been released since being monitored by Japanese warships and are still blocked off the mouth of the Oujiang River and the waters of Lihang. The ships have now requested the company to ask the consulate to negotiate with the Japanese side to maintain navigation rights.

Shanghai-Zhejiang Mail Awaits Opportunity for Ship Transport

Datong News Agency reports that since the recapture of Zhenhai, wireless telegraphs between Shanghai and Zhenhai have been restored yesterday, and the local American news agency is receiving and sending messages as usual. However, due to the fact that the area has been occupied and residents have been evacuated, there are bound to be difficulties in delivery, but this is expected to be resolved. Telegrams between Shanghai and Ningbo are still very smooth, and due to the war, traffic is particularly frequent, several times more than usual. As for postal deliveries between Shanghai and eastern Zhejiang, the Shanghai Post Office originally changed the route via Fuzhou and Wuxing to forward the mail. According to the Datong News Agency reporter's inquiry with the transportation section of the Shanghai Post Office, now that Zhenhai has been recaptured and the war in eastern Zhejiang is about to end, foreign shipping companies are planning to resume navigation at the earliest opportunity. Mail sent from Shanghai to eastern Zhejiang will be restored to ship transport in order to facilitate convenience.

### 自來火公司工潮　調解仍無頭緒　眾信今日或將開始談判　職員援助工人亦吿怠工

Gas Company Labor Dispute: Mediation Still Has No Clue; It is Believed that Negotiations May Begin Today; Staff Also Goes on Strike to Assist Workers

After the workers of the old plant of the British-owned Gas Company submitted a written request for 16 items to Chief Engineer Samson on the 19th, the company refused, resulting in a go-slow strike. The workers of the old plant also requested all staff and workers of the Yangshupu new plant to respond to the workers of the old plant, so they went on strike from the 20th, and all staff also went on a sit-down strike from that day.

Staff Strikes to Show Support

However, the staff did not make any demands to the manager, Blanc. This strike is purely to assist the workers and express sympathy. At 10:00 am yesterday, the chairman of the company, Jia Daoli, suddenly ordered all Chinese staff to leave the office from 11:00 am. After all staff explained the difficulties of this strike, the company authorities then understood, so all Chinese staff still sat in the office, waiting for the workers' side to resolve the matter.

Workers Plan to Appeal to All Parties

According to worker representatives, the unfortunate incident occurred because the company authorities failed to fulfill the conditions for improving treatment agreed upon in April. At a time when prices are soaring and the cost of living is high, it is really difficult to maintain, so they had no choice but to make demands to the company authorities again. However, they did not obtain the understanding of Chief Engineer Samson, the person in charge of the company, who refused to reply and could not negotiate, forming the current stalemate. Now the workers' side plans to appeal to all relevant groups for assistance.

Gas Supply Unsatisfactory

Since the labor dispute occurred, although Gu Bingyuan, director of the Industrial Section of the Shanghai Municipal Council, has been mediating, the attitudes of both sides are firm and there is no way to start. The company has hired a large number of White Russians to replace the work, so the gas supply has not been interrupted. However, due to the lack of experience of the newly hired White Russians, the new work is not satisfactory. According to a staff member of the company, the gas pressure is often reduced at noon every day, resulting in a reduction in the heat of various users, but the raw materials used by the company are more than usual, which has caused considerable losses.

Rumors that Negotiations May Begin Today

The English-language Ta Mei Evening Post reports that the British-owned Gas Company, due to the workers' strike, cannot continue to supply gas as usual, and announced this morning (24th) that from noon today, the gas supply in the northern part of the Public Concession will be halved compared to usual. Personnel of the company could not say for sure whether gas users in the southern part of the Public Concession would also be affected. However, the company is expected to take temporary measures to maintain normal supply as much as possible during the strike period. Labor and management have not yet held discussions, but it is believed that negotiations may begin tomorrow (25th). At the same time, the company has hired several White Russians to enter the factory to continue the work, and several Western employees are also working extra hours in the factory.

The Rice Dealers Group ordered 100,000 bags of foreign rice (10,000 tons) for continuous shipment to Shanghai for adjustment. Subsequently, after the establishment of the Rice Evaluation Committee, a subcommittee was established to handle the ordering of foreign rice by the group. Each foreign firm was entrusted to order rice from abroad by telegram, totaling 75,000 bags from Saigon and 25,000 bags from Hong Kong, and the quality was quite good. Of these foreign rice, more than 20,000 bags from Hong Kong have been continuously shipped to Shanghai for the market. All 75,000 bags from Saigon were loaded onto ships from the place of origin at the beginning of this month and can be successively shipped to Shanghai around the 27th and 28th of this month. It is learned that if the importers of this batch of foreign rice supply the market in the future, the transaction price must be sold below the price assessed by the Rice Evaluation Committee.

The high tide of the Huangpu River has subsided since yesterday. It is found that next month, because it is the middle of the autumn flood season, the tide of the Huangpu River will reach nearly 13 feet at its highest, which will be adjacent to the Jiang'an River bank. If there is wind and rain, it is prone to flooding.

### 物價調查處　籲請市民合作　奸商抬價應吿發並證明　當局方可判斷加以處置

Price Investigation Office Calls for Citizens to Cooperate; Price Gouging by Unscrupulous Merchants Should be Reported and Proven; Only then Can the Authorities Judge and Deal With It

The Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury reports that an official from the Price Investigation Office of the Shanghai Municipal Council recently called on citizens to cooperate with the office and report any illegal profiteering by merchants in order to curb the high cost of living. It is claimed that the Shanghai Municipal Council is eager to raise public concern about the prices of food and commodities. Citizens can certainly denounce illegal profiteers as despicable and unscrupulous merchants, but the Shanghai Municipal Council cannot make a judgment without proof. Therefore, it is eager for public cooperation. Whenever a merchant charges excessively high prices, they should report it to the authorities and provide proof. Only then can the authorities take action.

Urge Reporting

Most citizens do not pay attention to the work of the office. Take household bread as an example. It sells for 38 cents per pound, while other kinds of bread sell for 60 to 70 cents. The Shanghai Municipal Council has widely publicized this, but many citizens say they have not heard of household bread, which is quite surprising. The staff of the Price Investigation Office do their best to work for the citizens, and if they receive reports, they will do their best to handle them. Now some merchants are still raising prices indiscriminately and profiting illegally. The Price Investigation Office cannot do anything about this without proof.

Household Bread

Household bread baked by bakeries in the Public Concession can still be profitable. Recently, the price of Chinese flour has risen by 80 cents per bag. The bakeries have asked the Shanghai Municipal Council to reconsider the price limit. The bureau suggested that the matter be put on hold until the beginning of next month for discussion. The bakeries have agreed, hoping that the price of flour will fall at that time so that there is no need to raise the price of bread. At the same time, it is necessary to ensure that the public can buy the household bread they need.

In addition, the Fair Price Committee of the French Concession, in view of the fact that the public's complaints about the manufacture of household bread are not sufficient, inspected several bakeries in the concession on June 27, with representatives from the Police Department and the Health Department. It was found that the household bread sold by each shop was of good quality and sufficient quantity, and those bakeries that did not comply with the regulations were also punished.

### 華北日偽　壟斷紗布　天津已實行　價格受統制

Japanese Puppet Regime in North China Monopolizes Yarn; Implemented in Tianjin; Prices Subject to Control

The Japanese puppet regime in North China is oppressing merchants and civilians at every level. In addition to yarn, the import and export of all goods is completely under control, implementing "goods exchange." If goods are transported from other ports, they cannot be exchanged for cash and must be purchased entirely with local goods. Export goods must be settled in foreign exchange and must be stored in Yokohama Bank as a deposit. This method has been implemented for almost a year, and merchants have suffered greatly from this scourge. Recently, it has become even more intensified. Yarn is also being planned to be under control. The price must also be estimated by the local Japanese puppet regime, and cannot be increased or decreased privately. Tianjin was originally scheduled to implement it from the 1st of this month, but it was postponed to the 5th. It is heard that the local Japanese yarn factories have negotiated with the Tianjin Japanese Military Department, so the yarn from the factory can be transported without restrictions. Recently, it has also been heard that Yantai, Weihaiwei, and other ports will also implement control at the end of this month. Therefore, in the future, shipments of piece goods and cotton yarn from this city to various ports in North China, regardless of the products of British, American, or other merchants, will be squeezed out without any doubt.

### 本埠英僑志願捐款　購機捐獻政府　已得英金一三四五一鎊　及華幣二零七五三六元

British Overseas Chinese in This City Voluntarily Donate Funds to Purchase Aircraft and Donate Them to the Government; Already Received £13,451 Sterling and $207,536 Chinese Currency

Since the outbreak of the European War, British overseas Chinese in this city have shown great patriotism and have donated large sums of money to help the government in the war of resistance or to provide for the needs of caring for wounded soldiers. The British Overseas Chinese Wartime Voluntary Donation, which was recently launched, has been well-received since its promotion. According to the association's announcement, as of the 20th of this month, the donations received by HSBC and Mackellar & Co. totaled £13,451, 10 shillings and 2 pence sterling and $207,536 Chinese currency. The result is very satisfactory, but it is still far from the planned amount of £50,000. Currently, British overseas Chinese are working hard to solicit donations in order to reach the huge amount of £50,000, aid the government's war of resistance, and demonstrate the loyalty of the overseas Chinese in this city to the government and people of their motherland.

Fundraising to Purchase Warplanes for Donation to the Government

The British Overseas Chinese Wartime Voluntary Donation is currently planning to purchase a squadron of aircraft and donate them to the government to enhance the strength of the war of resistance. Among them, it is planned to purchase several single-wing fighters and Whirling drome three-engine long-range bombers. These aircraft have repeatedly established meritorious service and inflicted serious blows on the enemy. It is said that the long-range bombers can take off from England, fly to any place in Germany to drop bombs, and return to defense safely.

Sir Sassoon Donates a Large Sum of Money

Corneille, the British Ambassador to Shanghai, recently received £35,000 sterling donated by Sir Sassoon, transferred from the Royal Aeronautical Society. This donation will be allocated to domestic and foreign aviation facilities, and all previous donations of this kind will be allocated to the Wartime Voluntary Donation.

### Lai Yiren Accused of Bigamy Transferred to Special Court No. 1 Due to Jurisdictional Error

Lai Yiren, a 41-year-old Guangdong native residing at No. 13, Yunshang Village, Lane 22, Sitolang Road, French Concession, currently employed by the AIG Insurance Company, formerly Assistant Manager of the Nanjing Commercial Savings Branch, and once a university professor, married Huang Qiaolian, a woman of the same hometown and age, in 1929. They had children. Later, disliking her for being old and losing her looks, on August 18th of last year, he again married Fei Guiying, a 25-year-old woman from Pinghu (a graduate of Cambridge English College, former university professor, and currently working for AIG Insurance Company), at the International Hotel on Jing'an Temple Road. On April 27th of this year, they had a son. Due to postpartum illness, she was admitted to Crome Hospital for treatment on June 16th. When she recovered and was discharged from the hospital this month, she found that Lai had moved out, and discovered that Lai was cohabiting with Niu Jingyuan (age 27, a policewoman from Beiping). She reported this to the police, who summoned Lai to the Special Court. The police prosecuted him for bigamy. According to the plaintiff's statement of the previous situation, and the engagement of a lawyer as an agent, an additional 2,000 yuan was sought in compensation. Lai Yiren claimed that he and Huang Qiaolian were only cohabiting and not married, and that he had been cohabiting with Niu Jingyuan for many years, not committing bigamy. It was ordered to reschedule the hearing to summon witnesses for questioning. Yesterday, another hearing was held. First, the police lawyer, Fei Xizhen, stated that the bigamy in this case occurred in the Public Concession and should be transferred to the Special Court No. 1 for trial. Judge Sun Pengham ordered that the case be transferred to the Special Court No. 1 for investigation, and the defendant remained under the original bail.

### After Disappearance, Child Bride Suddenly Marries Another Woman Files Lawsuit Claiming Marriage Contract Invalid Factory Owner Accused of Disrupting Family

Shi Yun, a woman from Ningbo, recently filed a lawsuit in the Criminal Division of the First Special District Court with her daughter Zheng Shi Meiying, engaging a lawyer to accuse Li Hanmin, the young owner of the Tiancheng Light Bulb Factory at No. 270, E'erjin Road, Zhejiang, and Zhou Hongying of disrupting the family. The indictment stated that Shi Yun's husband, Shi Dingyou, hired Zhou Hongying, the nine-year-old daughter of Zhou Dunlu, in Dantu County on June 8th of the lunar calendar in 1931 as a child bride for his son Shi Wenlin. They had a betrothal gift. After she came to their home, they lived peacefully. Later, due to difficult living conditions, on July 15th, 1933, Hongying was sent to live with Shi Meiying's family, and Shi was asked to supervise her. However, Meiying also found the family poor and had to ask Hongying to learn to make light bulbs as a female worker. In March 1939, she changed to work at Tiancheng Light Bulb Factory. Unexpectedly, on April 9th, Hongying suddenly disappeared. The next morning, she received a letter from Hongying's lawyer

requesting dissolution of the marriage agreement. On May 22nd, she received a summons from the Second Special Court regarding a lawsuit to confirm the invalidity of the marriage contract. As Shi lived far away in Chongqing, she was unable to respond to the lawsuit. Now, something unexpected happened: on the 6th of this month, Hongying was induced by the defendant Li Hanmin (the young owner of the Tiancheng factory) to marry at the Zhimeilou Restaurant on Fourth Horse Road. It was also rumored that Hongying was already several months pregnant. Hongying is only seventeen years old and should be protected and supervised by Shi in accordance with the law. Moreover, Hongying's lawsuit in the Second Special Court to declare the marriage contract invalid

has not yet been decided. How can she proceed with other matters? Hongying is just young and ignorant and has been deceived, while the defendant Li Hanmin is clearly committing a crime under Article 240, Section 12 of the Criminal Law. It is requested that he be punished according to the law. However, after receiving the summons, the defendant Li Hanmin also engaged a lawyer to file a defense, stating that the defendant's ex-wife had passed away and he had not remarried. In June of this year, Chen Yimin, an employee of the Tiancheng factory, came forward as a matchmaker. He was quite familiar with Zhou Hongying's parents. Now Zhou's daughter is dissatisfied with the marriage contract arranged by her parents and chooses to marry Shi Wenlin. Now that the girl is an adult, she is willing

to form another good marriage and marry the defendant. Therefore, on July 6th, they formally married at Zhimeilou. Because Zhou's father is paralyzed in his hometown, his uncle Fu Kui was entrusted to preside over the wedding. In summary, this case is entirely due to the failure to extort a thousand yuan. It is requested that he be acquitted. Yesterday morning, Judge Meng questioned the case and ordered that it be rescheduled for further verification.

### Bomb Thrown into Gambling Den at No. 1238 Two Gamblers Severely Injured

At 10:30 PM yesterday, at the large gambling den at No. 1238, Pingyuan Road, Huxi, while the gamblers were loudly calling out their bets and in high spirits, a thug suddenly threw a bomb inside, causing an explosion on the spot.

Afterwards, near a certain gambling table, two male and female gamblers were found to be severely injured by the explosion. They were taken to the hospital for treatment by ambulance. It was also heard that the injured man and woman had died due to their severe injuries.

### Letter

Dear Editor, According to Lu Zhenqing, the director of the Zhongxi Sanatorium, much of the content of the news article "Head Nurse Dies Suddenly" on page 12 of the Shen Bao on the 20th of this month is inconsistent with the facts. (1) Li Shizhen and others have fabricated false accusations against Zhenqing, such as saying that Li Jieru (i.e., Yu Ying) died suddenly from poisoning. After an autopsy, the forensic doctor determined that she died of acute heart disease and there was no poisoning. (2) On the 19th of this month, the investigative court only summoned Zhenqing to the court to inquire about the disposal of Li Jieru's belongings and did not summon Lin Zhengliang. (3) The deceased's remaining funds of 7,200 yuan were deposited in the sanatorium during her lifetime as a guarantee for the food and medicine expenses of her eight family members during their 21 months of hospitalization. This account has not yet been settled and is pending court order for settlement. (4) The deceased's numerous pieces of clothing and three gold bracelets are pending court order for the lawyers of both parties to discuss a settlement plan. After a public announcement in the newspaper regarding Li Jieru's outstanding debts, if there are no objections, they will be handed over to the plaintiff's attorneys, Zhuang and Li, for safekeeping. Before the case is resolved, Attorneys Zhuang and Li will provide the Li family with a monthly living allowance of 200 yuan, not to exceed that amount, to prevent the remnants from being insufficient to repay the debts. Therefore, the debts will also be handled by Attorneys Zhuang and Li. The above items have been signed in court by all parties involved and their respective attorneys, and there are investigative records to prove it. No other issues were involved. As it concerns my reputation, I specifically ask you to send a letter on my behalf to the Shen Bao to request a correction for your consideration, respectively. I am now informing you for the urgent consideration of the chief editor of the Shen Bao for a quick correction. Yours sincerely, Lawyers Ling Changyan, Shan Yuhua,

### Zhu He, Son of Late Famous Doctor Zhu Nanshan Kidnapped Yesterday Criminals Registered in Advance Requesting House Call Car Arrives at Xiaoshadu Road No Kidnapping

Zhu Hegao, a 30-year-old native of Nantong, is the second son of the late famous doctor Zhu Nanshan. He runs a clinic at No. 96, Avenue Edward VII, Public Concession. His medical practice is prosperous and his income is very high. In addition to practicing medicine, Zhu also runs a pharmaceutical business. Over the years, his family has become quite wealthy and owns a private car, No. 2007, which aroused the covetousness of criminals. Yesterday afternoon, a well-dressed man went to Zhu's clinic to register and requested a house call, paying the consultation fee in full. He said that the patient lived at No. 3, Lane 337, Xiaoshadu Road. After speaking, he turned around and went outside. At 5:95 PM in the evening, Zhu Hegao and two students took his private car, No. 2007, to the address. Unexpectedly, upon arriving at the lane, they could not find No. 3 anywhere. They turned back to step out of the lane entrance, preparing to board the car and return home, when suddenly four kidnappers emerged from the roadside. Three of the criminals drew pistols, threatening them to stop the car. The driver, seeing the pistols, dared not resist and stayed with the car. One of the criminals chased the driver down, and the four criminals then boarded the car in succession, kidnapping Zhu Hegao and his two students.

### Unified Enrollment for Public Colleges and Universities in Chengdu Area Liberal Arts and Law Departments Have the Most Applicants Ministry of Education Stipulates Quotas for Normal School Students in Each Province and City

(Chengdu, 23rd) The unified enrollment examination for public colleges and universities in the Chengdu area for the 29th year has been completed on the 23rd. Among the students who applied this time, the departments of liberal arts and law had the most applicants, followed by science and engineering, and then agriculture and medicine. All test papers will be graded within five days and sent to the Ministry of Education.

(Chongqing, 23rd) When the Ministry of Education convened the Second Advanced Normal Education Conference this year, it stipulated that when normal colleges in each province and city enroll students, the allocation of student quotas should be increased or decreased based on the number of classes in middle schools and normal schools in each province. The quota stipulated for each province and city is used to calculate the total number of students in normal colleges. The Unified Enrollment Committee paid special attention when admitting and distributing students who applied to normal colleges in each province and city. It is now learned that the quotas stipulated for each province and city are as follows: Sichuan, 110; Yunnan, 50; Guizhou, 40; Guangdong, 85; Shandong (including Qingdao), 60; Shanxi, 35; Jiangsu (including Nanjing, Shanghai), 120; Fujian, 50; Hebei (including Tianjin, Beiping), 95; Zhejiang, 45; Anhui, 45; Hunan, 65; Hubei, 35; Henan, 55; Jiangxi, 55; Guangxi, 50; Shaanxi, 40; Kang, 14; Liaoning, 20; Gansu, 25; Jilin, 14; Heilongjiang, 14; Rehe, 14; Ningxia, 8; Chahar, 8; Qinghai, 8; Suiyuan, 8; Xinjiang, 8; totaling 1,176 students.

### New Regulations for Hong Kong School Buildings Execution Delayed for Justice Schools

(Hong Kong ) Currently, the Hong Kong Education Authority, in order to improve the learning environment for students in various schools, has promulgated new education regulations, requiring all schools to comply with the regulations in a short period. The facilities of the justice schools for the poor in Hong Kong and Kowloon are also subject to the restrictions of these regulations. However, the nature of running justice schools is only to educate and nurture poor children, and everything is simplified and focuses on the general. In terms of funding, it relies solely on the efforts of charitable organizations or individual overseas Chinese merchants. Therefore, in addition to striving for perfection in teaching, the facilities of each justice school cannot take into account other hygiene and various facilities as stipulated in the education regulations. Moreover, the number of students accommodated by each justice school is no less than that of other schools. Therefore, after the implementation of this regulation, tens of thousands of poor students will lose the opportunity to enjoy education. For this reason, the persons in charge of each justice school have repeatedly consulted on remedial measures and have sent letters to four Chinese representatives, requesting them to appeal to the Hong Kong government authorities and urge the repeal of the parts of the new regulations related to justice schools, in order to protect the education of tens of thousands of students. According to the letter, the Chinese representatives forwarded it to the Hong Kong authorities. When this proposal was presented at the Legislative Council meeting in the previous period, the Chinese representative Lo Man Kam raised questions and argued reasonably, believing that very few of the public schools in Hong Kong can meet the requirements of the regulations in their equipment and school building construction methods. There is a need for repeal. According to semi-official sources, the Hong Kong government authorities now consider the reasons for this request to be very sufficient and worth considering. Moreover, the flourishing phenomenon of various justice schools has only been seen since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War. Therefore, their nature is a wartime adjunct. If the Sino-Japanese War ends, the number of justice schools will inevitably decrease, which can be predicted. Moreover, in this extraordinary period, it is not easy for each justice school to find a school building that meets the requirements of the new regulations. Therefore, in order to protect the education of each student, it may accept the request of each justice school and postpone the implementation of the regulations.

### Recent Work of the Plant Pathology Group at the Tsinghua University Agricultural Research Institute

(Kunming Correspondent) The recent work of the Plant Pathology Group at the National Tsinghua University Agricultural Research Institute is briefly described below:

(1) The Yunnan Economic Plant Disease Survey Association surveyed Kunming, Anning, Dongchuan, Zhaotong, and more than 20 other places, collected more than 4,700 wheat spikes, and hundreds of disease specimens. The diseases of various economic plants, such as rice, wheat, millet, sorghum, fruits, and vegetables, were analyzed one by one, and several species were found in each category.

(2) Research on Wheat Diseases The quality of Yunnan wheat varieties is not low, but due to mixed varieties and rampant diseases, the output is greatly affected. The institute conducted various experiments on foreign varieties, improved varieties, and fungicides for the prevention and control of wheat smut to prepare for research.

(3) Prevention and Control of Cotton Diseases Cooperating with the Yunnan Cotton Promotion Committee and sending personnel to conduct field surveys, it is planned to carry out disease-resistant breeding work.

(4) Soybean Seed Selection Experiments Seeds from various provinces were planted separately for the purpose of cultivating soybean varieties suitable for Yunnan Province. It is necessary to have excellent quality and abundant yield, and the most qualified are those that can resist root rot and pod rot.

(5) Discovery of New Species of Bacteria The canker of castor bean and the scabies of soybeans may be new species unseen by predecessors and require special attention. The institute has written a detailed report.

(6) Research on Chicken Fungus Because chicken fungus grows on termite nests, this type of termite must rely on the fungi cultivated on the fungal platform in the nest to survive. Separation and cultivation are carried out to investigate the changes, and a preliminary research report has been written.

(7) Fungal Survey In addition to those that cause diseases on economic plants, there are many types of fungi that are related to human life. The group has collected more than 2,000 fungal specimens in Yunnan, named them, and drawn illustrations, planning to cooperate with Jinling University to compile an atlas of fungi in Sichuan and Yunnan.

### Eastern Team in Yangon Heavily Defeats Champion Team – Hou Scores Three Goals

The first half ended in a one-to-one tie. There were 15,000 spectators. In this match, Hou Chengtuo, the left winger of the Eastern team, performed excellently and was the most dangerous person among all the forwards. The defenders Wu Qixiang and Li Yichen also had brilliant performances, repeatedly repelling the enemy's attack from thousands of miles away in the first half when the Yangon team launched many offensives. Their contribution was very great. Ji Youling, who joined from Singapore as a right midfielder, was quite steady. Another outstanding performer was the left forward Cao Qiuting. After the start of the game, the Customs team scored first, but Hou Chengtuo equalized before the end of the first half. The Eastern team often took the offensive in the second half, but due to the muddy field, all movements in the game were quite slow and also quite rough. Hou Chengtuo broke through the enemy's defenses twice from the left wing and shot successfully. Xu Wenkui scored a goal with a beautiful shot from the center forward position. In conclusion, the Eastern team overcame the Yangon champion team by a score of four to one. The Eastern lineup is as follows:

### Finance – Little Fluctuation in Foreign Exchange

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no changes in HSBC's listed prices. The dark market for British and American currencies seemed the same as before. This was because there were no stimulating news from home and abroad, and most operators were in a state of rest. Any activity was all swap trading. Looking at the process of the half-day, from the opening in the morning to the closing at noon, there were no fluctuations. However, it was heard that the Bank of Italy was opening August exchange rates at 3 yuan and 7 jiao and 7 fen, and this price showed a slight drop. Therefore, the London gold closing price was slightly increased by 0.015625, to 3 shillings and 890625 pence. The US dollar was 6 yuan and 1 jiao and 2 fen and 5 li, as stable as before. The trend of futures was no different from that of the spot market.

Trading Remains Only Swaps

In the early morning, the London market was higher, with a near-term increase of 25 and a far-term price steady. The New York silver market remained steady, and London raw gold was flat. The exchange rate for British against American currency was unchanged, and against Shanghai was also flat. The American dollar was higher by half a point against the British pound, higher by one point against Shanghai, and there was no market against the French franc. The central bank's listed exchange rates for all currencies remained the same. Banks opened the spot selling prices in the morning, with British gold at 3 shillings and 875 pence and the US dollar at 6 yuan and 125 li, with no changes compared to the previous day's evening closing. At the same time, futures opened very steady. After opening, it was heard that the China Bank Shanghai had bought US dollars for this month from foreign banks at 6 yuan and 15625 li, but this price was quite difficult to settle. HSBC announced its listed prices at 9:30, with no changes at all. The silver balancing tax increased by 1.75%. After this, the market remained stable.

By noon, the Bank of Italy was opening August exchange rates at 3 yuan and 7 jiao and 7 fen, which seemed to have slightly dropped. Therefore, the closing price of British gold increased slightly by 0.015625, to 3 shillings and 90625 pence. The US dollar was 6 yuan and 1 jiao and 2 fen and 5 li, and August was 6 yuan and 0625 li, with no difference compared to the day before yesterday.

### Gold Market Peaceful and Quiet

Yesterday's cash gold dark market conditions were even more desolate, which was also a rare occurrence recently. This was because the foreign exchange market lacked fluctuations, and the market was peaceful and quiet. Speculators had no way to start, and there were very few transactions. The market opened in the early morning because the silver house sold only 5,000 at 141 yuan, 30 yuan lower than the previous day. Later, due to short covering by money changers and securities firms willing to buy at low prices, it was pulled up to 5,280 yuan. However, small retail investors took the opportunity to sell, so the noon closing price was lower at 5,263 yuan, 7 yuan smaller compared to the previous night's closing. In the afternoon, there was no market on Wednesday. The half-day transaction was only about 700 to 800 taels. Silver jewelry remained steady, and customs gold remained flat.

Gold Fell Again by 7 Yuan

Since the first tael (10 taels) in the early morning carried the fatigue from the previous day, there were quite a few sellers when it opened, and it was actually pressed down by 30 yuan. A certain silver house sold 20 taels to fellow firms at 5,240 yuan. Later, the foreign exchange rate was flat, and the gold price could not help but be too small, which soon caused considerable buying. Money changers and silver houses absorbed especially much. Although a certain gold house and scalpers dumped at this time, the number was difficult to measure, and it finally saw an increase of 40 yuan. Silver houses did 50 taels with each other at 5,280 yuan, but after this, there were still many sellers at the higher price, and the upward trend was immediately hindered. And before long, securities firms and retail investors sold out, and the price could not support the downstream. By the time of closing, it had retreated to 5,263 yuan, resulting in 7 yuan smaller than the previous day. There were only 40 yuan up and down in half a day. The cash house's selling price of its own brand of gold was several tens of yuan higher according to the gold, and the purchase price was reduced by 30 yuan. The current standard gold was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there was little activity.

Jewelry Stands Still

The exchange of silver jewelry per tael is still flat. Datong Bank still hangs 540 yuan, and the new colleagues are similar to the above price, and the purchase is reduced by about 30 yuan.

### Foreign Currencies Stable

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw small changes in gold, and British and American gold and iron pounds were also stable. The demand for British gold tickets has gradually decreased, and the price has trended downward again. The American gold ticket hovered between 10 yuan, 2 jiao and 5 fen and 3 jiao, and finally settled at 16 yuan, 3 jiao and 7 fen, a reduction of 4 fen compared to the previous day. Hong Kong tickets had slightly more demand, and the market price rose slightly. Japanese gold tickets and Korean tickets still had high demand, and the market prices rose slightly. The former was 1 yuan, 1 jiao, 1 fen and 2 li, and the latter was 1 yuan and 5 li.

### Securities and Foreign Debt Report Declines, Domestic Debt Slightly Weak

Yesterday's securities dark market saw a slight sell-off by floating investors, and there were no enthusiastic buyers. Market prices were slightly weaker. Many parties without real strength often followed the rise and fall of the market, resulting in a slight wave-like phenomenon in the market. There were more transactions yesterday morning, with Lemao Lianyi buying, but Tongkang Hongdashun, Tailianhe, etc. all had sell-offs. Buying sentiment was stronger, and market prices were slightly weaker. Transactions were extremely light in the afternoon, and the ups and downs were extremely small, and it had become stagnant. As a result, market prices all fell by a small amount of 1 jiao to 3 jiao and 5 fen. The total number of transactions was estimated to be about 500,000 yuan. A simple category table is listed below:

Category Highest Lowest Closing Compared to Previous Day
Unified A 62.7 62.70 Down 0.30
Unified B 54.00 53.80 53.80 Down 0.15

Stock transactions involved 70 shares of Zhentai Yarn Factory, with a price of 94 yuan.

The stock market in the Public Concession yesterday, like other markets in the city, has turned into a gloomy stage after a relatively optimistic action of one or two weeks. British Union and Jardine Matheson's transactions again accounted for the largest number. A certain Jardine Matheson share direct transaction opened with a large number of 10,000 shares. Rubber shares were quiet and stable.

### Grain – More Large Quantities of Foreign Rice Are Arriving, Rice Prices Still Weak

After the rice market softened the day before yesterday, the market opened yesterday with sales still unchanged. The original root merchants also held firm, and the market presented a stalemate situation in the early market. The market still lacked changes. However, the general floating speculators, seeing that sales were stagnant again, were discouraged and began to sell out first. Therefore, the foreign rice market fell slightly by about half a yuan. The original root merchants also followed suit, and thus the price dropped by 1 yuan. However, the sales market gradually became active, and the local rice shops took advantage of the cheap prices to purchase, and their intentions were quite strong. The near-market situation gradually became weak and tight, and the selling price also rebounded slightly. As a result, the closing price of No. 1 old Saigon was again far from 56 yuan. It was heard that all the Saigon rice that was previously ordered would arrive in port within a few days. The arriving goods were estimated to be three ships of about 150,000 to 160,000 bags. In addition, there were small batches of 20,000 to 30,000 bags and small batches of 3,000 to 5,000 bags that could arrive from Hong Kong and Vietnam. Therefore, people were weak and wanted to sell out. The opening price in the early market immediately fell by more than 1 yuan. Later, local merchants took advantage of the small inquiries, and there were also customers and short covering activities on the road goods. The market returned to 2 jiao to 3 jiao before the closing. The opening price of road goods was flat, and then the Shantou and Hangzhou gangs made some inquiries, and the short covering also made some inquiries. The cargo side insisted. No. 2 rice loaded on June 26th rose from 62 yuan to 62 yuan and 2 jiao, a better 2 jiao. Saigon No. 2 for early July also rose by 8 jiao to 61 yuan, and broken rice loaded on July 15th opened at 50 yuan. The total market turnover was nearly 300 tons, and the current rice was less than 4,000 bags.

The arrival of japonica and glutinous rice is still sparse, only 600 to 700 bags of japonica rice. It is rumored that general cargo owners in the Ming and dark markets not only have slow sales but also light selling, and although the selling price has depreciated limitedly, it is only about half a yuan. Changbang fresh special Qing japonica is 69 yuan and 68 yuan and a half, special Qing japonica is 68 yuan, Wuxi Qing japonica is 67 yuan and a half, 67 yuan, Changzhou Sukun japonica is high from 66 yuan and a half to 62 yuan, Qingsi thin rice is 66 yuan and 7 yuan, Nangang early rice is 63 yuan, and Hujian is 60 yuan, fresh is 61 yuan, 60 yuan and 5 yuan, glutinous rice Yangzhou special yuan is 63 yuan and 6 jiao, 63 yuan, Jintan special yuan is 63 yuan and 2 jiao, 62 yuan for 8 jiao, Changdan Baiyuan is 62 yuan and a half, 62 yuan, second is 60 yuan and 8 jiao, Hong Kong special goods are 60 yuan and 59 yuan and a half, city is 58 yuan, and second is 57 yuan and 56 yuan and a half.

### Japanese Flour Rebounds

The decline in flour yesterday has stopped. On the Chinese factory side, because the current production is not much, in addition to meeting the daily needs of this street, the customers also dislike the high factory prices and have stopped selling invisibly. Most of them have shifted to miscellaneous brand flour. For example, the Japanese factory flour Phoenix brand has caused the sales of local customers since the price fell to 14 yuan and 1 jiao. It is estimated that more than 2,000 bags of goods for this month have been opened, initially at 14 yuan and 2 jiao, and then rose to 14 yuan and 3 jiao and a half, a better 2 jiao to 3 jiao than before. The prices of other miscellaneous brands of flour have also been stable, but there have been no wholesale transactions. The factory price of Lao Che and Fuxin brand flour still needs 16 yuan, and the transaction is only 3,000 to 4,000 bags.

Wheat The market yesterday was the same as before. Because the new goods arriving at Hongkou are mostly on the wharf waiting to be sold, the Japanese factory has had its fill and intends to hoard small and take, while the Chinese factory cannot buy in large quantities due to the bad environment, so buying and selling are being held.

### Yarn and Cotton – Consumption is Weak, Production is Strong, Yarn and Cloth Have Become a Stalemate

The yarn market is flat and lacks characteristics. Because the actual sales have no hope of great development, and the foreign exchange market has little fluctuation, people are dark and without energy, and speculators have no means to do anything. Thus, the market has become a stalemate. Only a few people have a very optimistic mind. In short, consumption is too weak, and production is strong. Comparing the two sides, it is difficult to balance. According to this observation, if there are no unexpected changes at present, it may be difficult to be very excited.

The yarn market opened in the morning and the atmosphere was still calm. There were few new buyers like morning stars. The opening price was 929 yuan, falling by 5 yuan to 6 yuan compared with the previous day. As soon as the low price opened, the scalpers slightly collected a few bags, and the bidding rose slightly to 936 yuan. The households with short-term thoughts can earn some oil and water work, and seeing the wind make the rudder, they spit out to the outside, and fell back to 932 yuan. Judging from the market situation, everyone is doing scalping transactions. The closing price was 934 yuan. The statistics for the half-day transactions were 1,465 bags. The market price of 20 count Shuangma increased by 2 yuan. The amount of purchases by various gangs is listed on the left.

Hong Kong 655 Fellow firms 810 Statistics 465

### Cotton is as Stagnant as Ever

Spot cotton transactions are still semi-stagnant. The factory side is quiet. As for the goods previously ordered by the same industry, they have not been sold out, so mutual buying and selling have no excitement. All the morbid states are the same as the yarn market. Fire machine grass bag is 150 yuan, fellow firms traded 180 bags, Indian flower 200 bags, fellow firms entered 200 pieces, all are wharf transactions.

Another report on the foreign cotton market price, the New York cotton market, was firm yesterday. The weather report in the cotton area was bad, and some shorts were covered. As a result, the closing price was 2 to 3 pounds higher than the previous day. The Indian cotton market increased by one rupee on the day including the forecast.

The Shanghai foreign cotton transaction has been very quiet in recent days. The factory side has slightly added to the shortage of goods, but the number is very small, and most of them are still waiting and seeing. The needs of Japanese manufacturers are also very stagnant.

### Sugar Market – Dutch Red Alone Rises

Yesterday the sugar market weakened again, leading to a small drop. The guild's drawing price, spot 24 coarse white stacks on the upper line of the bank were 67 yuan, 8 jiao to 6 jiao, and in the afternoon it was 67 yuan, 6 jiao and a half, and a small 3 jiao and a half. Transit cargo was 52 yuan, 3 jiao to 52 yuan immediately hitting the bank, this end of the month was delivered 52 yuan, 6 jiao, a small 5 jiao and 6 jiao, August 2nd delivery was 52 yuan, 8 jiao, Dutch cotton white initially was 70 yuan, 7 jiao to jiao, and in the afternoon it was 70 yuan, a small 5 jiao, Taikoo Car White B mark was 77 yuan, 8 jiao to 6 jiao, a small 4 jiao, but Dutch red alone saw an upward exhibition, and was traded at 59 yuan, rising 4 jiao, the factory's snow white was 68 yuan, falling half a yuan, the first ice was 89 yuan, and Jingming ice was 90 yuan and a half, all falling 1 yuan.

### Oil Cakes – The Rise in Raw Oil Has Been Determined

Yesterday's trend in the peanut oil market, the rise in prices has been killed, because the warehouse has had its fill and is in a state of temporary rest. Yesterday only 20 barrels of Qingdao barrel oil were traded, with a price of 88 yuan on the original plate. Although soybean oil has broken the deadlock, its activity is very little excitement. The state's actual sales are still waiting and seeing. Yesterday, Dalian barrel oil had fallen close to the unofficial price of 22 yuan, with a price of 91 yuan, and 50 loads of Dayouyu factory oil were traded, with a price of 64 yuan and 5 jiao. Today, there are 200 bags of soybeans and 50 pieces of soybean cake being transported to Little Luzon.

### Piece Goods – Domestic Cloth Sales Still Strong, Eastern Piece White Goods Plunge

Domestic cloth Yesterday, because the Cantonese and Hong Kong gangs still needed goods, although the Eastern piece price fell, the domestic cloth stood still. The prices of white goods and dyed cloth were stable. The street traded more than 300 pieces of grey cloth, fine cloth, and dyed cloth. The Cantonese and Hong Kong gangs handled Jardine Matheson coarse cloth, Shenxin, Yong'an fine cloth fine twill, colored cloth, and colored twill more than 200 pieces, and the Fujian gang handled line flannel, Serge, and Lunchang blue cloth more than 100 pieces. The cloth factory's August and September futures are gradually being traded, with five to six hundred pieces of grey cloth and coarse cloth. Twill velvet futures from Defeng, Qingfeng, Dawei, Xin Yi, and other factories have been opened one after another, and the North Road Yantai and other gangs have loaded out several batches.

Eastern Cloth Because the end of the month is approaching, the same industry's silver roots are very tight, and the decline in white goods is increasing. Yesterday, the middle-grade fine cloth of each brand continued to fall by 1 yuan per piece. High-grade Longtou fine cloth Xin stack fell by 7 jiao and a half alone, selling at 27 yuan and 7 jiao and a half, and no one consulted the old stack alone, falling by 2 yuan. The rear market was shouted at 25 yuan and 7 jiao and a half. The Four Gentlemen Serge was still firmer in comparison. The morning market closed at 8 jiao and 4 fen and a half, and the rear market was about 1 jiao and 4 fen.

### Summer Cotton and Wool Goods – Most Have Become a Thing of the Past

(White Serge) Regardless of thickness or quality, willow twig color, all fell. The Fengyu brand fell especially sharply, because actual sales have passed.

(White Zhigong) The English-made first-class goods are trending better, because they are thin, and the holders do not want to sell at reduced prices. The lower grades and striped white Zhigong, because there are many Shen textiles, the market price is falling daily.

(Police) Because the arrival and storage are full, the production of this factory has exceeded the demand, and the price has been falling continuously for two decades. Yesterday it was still trapped, weak, and although the price was specially reduced, few people consulted. Plain colors are worse than stripes.

(Wan Lieding) The trend is better than other summer wool and other goods. Market sales are not bad, and white, Tibetan, and cyan colors are especially popular, because its actual sales are endless, and there is not much market goods. Yesterday, ordinary English-made goods were still cut and sold at 27 to 8 yuan per yard.

(Ramie Cloth) For genuine ramie, only the sample unpacking gang has some storage, and the price is always firm. Sanjiang ramie cloth, because the price has risen sharply, the customer designation has been sharply reduced, resulting in the previous buyers having surplus, and the market has returned tired by several corners per yard. The sales of this factory's rushing goods woven with wax thread have increased suddenly, but because each family's products are too many and full of the market, the selling prices are now all falling.

(White Canvas) There is a lack of Japanese goods, and the circulation on the market is all Yao factory goods, because the width is the same as 36 inches, and the price is cheaper than Japanese goods. The price is mostly cheap.

(Yellow Twill) The trend is good, because the factory's products are not many, the import of Western goods is extremely scarce, and the demand is not weak, so the selling price is stable. In the recent wool class yarn textiles, it can be said to be the most dominant. Tea green is also good, and the supply and demand are balanced.

(Woolen Serge) The combination of sales in Chinese clothing is softening, and the combination of sales in Western clothing is slightly better, but compared with the trend of ten days ago, it is also falling. Barre Serge is sold similarly to wool serge, but because the quality is firm and many wool textiles are produced, it is rarely heard to be used for Chinese clothing. At present, summer sales are about to pass, and most of them are not as good as before.

### North and South Goods – Large Longan Steadily Rises

Miscellaneous road longan, the bottom inventory is thin, and there are no arrivals, resulting in large-grained goods becoming increasingly scarce. It is found that Guangfang's hand goods are also not many, so the bank's market has risen by more than 20 yuan. However, the medium and small grains are relatively stable because the demand is limited. New Zhang branches are expected to be released

The first batch of new Zhangzhou branches, because the traffic between Zhangzhou and Gulangyu is stalled, has been delayed in arriving in Shanghai. According to a customer letter yesterday, it is hoped that it will be restored on August 1, and if so, it should be able to ship to Shanghai in early August.

### Coal – White Coal Route Stagnant, Speculators Suffer a Lot

The white coal market has been declining in recent days. The street transactions are as cold as ever, and the eastern ports are affected by military affairs, and the stomach has stopped, so the market can not avoid step by step returning to decline. Anan white coal, fellow firms since the car, has shouted 206 yuan, the dark market still has a virtual head, old households suffer a lot, the shape presents a tired and unable to give the atmosphere.

### Hardware – Huisheng Iron Market Still Firm, But Actual Sales Are Not Smooth

The 100-pound American Huisheng iron transaction, recently because the Nanyang gang has no handling, the Tianjin gang rarely purchases, and the Ningbo, Wenzhou, Quanzhou, and Yangtze River road merchants are also rare in the stomach, and actual sales are not smooth. Although the city's factories, toy factories, and printing factories sometimes search for purchases, the number is small, and the entire market is not optimistic. However, because the source is blocked and the Shanghai storage is not abundant, although the market is depressed, the people are still excited, and the market is still firm. The city such as 200-pound new steel factory goods are selling for 155 yuan per box, and the old steel factory goods need 165 yuan per box, and 200-pound narrow strip iron is also sold for about 140 yuan.

### Old News Newly Copied: 67 Years Ago (455) (See the Report from the 12th Year of the Tongzhi Reign of the Late Qing Dynasty)

U.S. President's Travels (2)

U.S. President Grant served for eight years. Before becoming president, he was in the military during the time of conflict between the Northern and Southern United States. He was invincible on the battlefield, and he was adept at planning and strategy. After becoming president, he focused on ending the war and promoting agriculture, emphasizing trust and harmony. Not only was his ban on the sale of black slaves admirable, but his virtuous policies were also evident to all. After retiring, he traveled to various countries to observe the differences in customs and cultures, and the unique products and climates of different regions. Previously in Hong Kong, many people in Shanghai were already looking forward to his arrival. When he arrived in Shanghai, tens of thousands of people greeted him at the pier. It is said that the president will stay in Shanghai for several days and then go to Beijing to see the magnificence of the imperial palace and the prosperity of the capital before returning to his country. Foreign and Chinese officials and merchants in Shanghai are planning ways to entertain him day and night. The president sometimes walks to the Bund to enjoy the scenery. The president does not exalt himself, but people respect him. The reason why people respect him is not only because of his admirable virtues. Therefore, I praise him: "The illustrious United States, who is its master? The North and South conflicted, who governed them? He served for eight years, then left gracefully. He travels to all countries, and everyone praises him. He stops in Shanghai, and we are fortunate to see him. His demeanor is radiant, and we admire him greatly. I write these words and compose this ode for him."

### A Biased Heart

— Editor

A humble father writes:

"I am not talented, but I am the father of four children. I have always taken family education seriously, but I cannot judge whether I am qualified to be a father. But at least I am not one of those who 'do not know how to be parents, nor will they learn how to be parents.'"

"Reading the above, it seems that I am somewhat qualified to be a father, but I unconsciously tend to be biased towards my children (extremely loving, loving, and unloving). I often think of correcting this, because I deeply feel that the relationship between parents and children is so close that it cannot be casually chosen or discarded like friendship. Favoritism can have extremely bad effects, especially in families with many children and with former and later wives."

A biased heart can be said to be "something everyone has"; it is probably impossible to avoid it completely. However, parents should have a long-term vision in educating their children, aiming to cultivate useful talents for the future world as a permanent goal, and making the cultivation of healthy personalities of their children the ultimate goal. In this way, they will naturally be unwilling to cause any damage or destruction to the good nature of the next generation.

Parents who are biased towards their children should understand the harm of favoritism and try their best to suppress their biased heart, at least not to let it show in their outward actions.

This requires good self-cultivation, knowledge to deal with children, and an understanding of child psychology. This is not easy, but for the sake of the happiness of the next generation of mankind, we should do it!

Profession

### Reunion

— Yan Zheng

I happened to run into Mr. C, a teacher from my alma mater whom I hadn't seen in three years, in a noodle shop.

After nodding hello, I immediately realized that Mr. C was the owner of this noodle shop. I was surprised in my heart, but I didn't want to ask him directly.

At this time, a child of eleven or twelve years old brought me the plain noodles I had ordered. He stole glances at me with a pair of dark eyes.

"This is my second son," Mr. C said to me, pointing at the child. "We do everything ourselves."

I carefully looked at the child, and then looked around: the pockmarked woman kneading dough on the plank table at the entrance; the young man scooping noodles by the stove; the little girl with two pigtails squatting next to the lead bucket washing dishes; all had the same facial features as Mr. C.

"Wonderful! Wonderful!" I said admiringly. "But please tell me, why aren't you teaching at the school anymore?"

"You ask why! Haven't you heard...?" He stared back at me with bright eyes.

"I heard a little, but not in detail," I said.

"The principal wanted to be an official. Several teachers were greedy for profit. When they heard they could get double pay, they all stayed. Only Mr. B and I decided not to do it!"

"Mr. B went to the interior. Because I have so many children, I can only stay here. It's really not easy to find a decent position right now. So I took off my long gown and started this business!"

"It's so admirable that you're like this, Mr. C! So admirable!" I praised him sincerely.

"At first, I hired someone who knew how to knead dough. But when we learned how to do it ourselves, we dismissed him. Look, not bad, right? We can make a living this way."

The business was indeed very good. By this time, the shop was full of people. There were still people standing outside the door, craning their necks to look inside, looking for a place to sit.

Mr. C said, "Excuse me," and ran over. I heard him greeting the customers: "Please wait a moment, it will be ready soon! It will be ready soon!"

I hastily swallowed the noodles. Mr. C's second son deftly handed me a hot towel. I smiled and took it, and asked him, "How old are you?"

"Twelve years old."

When I paid at the counter, Mr. C repeatedly said, "Don't be polite, we're all family." But I finally threw the money on the counter and walked away without looking back. Behind me, his loud laughter flew over.

On the road, my mind was filled with Mr. C's bright eyes, and my ears were filled with his loud laughter. Suddenly, my lips moved, and I recited that old but ever-new sentence: "Wealth and rank cannot corrupt him, poverty and meanness cannot move him, power and force cannot subdue him."

As I recited, my steps became lighter.

The Hawthorne Investigation

### The Dance Queen's Dormitory

— By Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter Four: A Kind of Conjecture

Ni Jinshou's hope did not materialize. He had hoped the old woman would have some more important information, but it turned out to be nothing. Wu Ma was a Yangzhou woman over forty years old, with a plump face, matched with a disproportionately small mouth and small eyes, with a turned-up nose right in the center. If filmed, just having that face on the screen would be enough to make the audience laugh without her even speaking. Not only did her face tell me that her mind wouldn't be very sharp, but because of the excess fat on her body, her movements were also very clumsy. As she stumbled in, her narrow eyes darted around at the three of us, and her hands had nowhere to rest, clutching the corner of her dark blue Haichang cloth old-fashioned short shirt, constantly fidgeting.

Seven or eight out of ten of her answers were "I don't know." In fact, having been there for only two months, she really couldn't comprehend the complex lifestyle of her master. The facts she did know were ones we already knew; the more valuable one was that she confirmed that Zhao Boxiong had indeed come on the evening of the 18th, when she and Jinmei were eating dinner. She had the following description of Zhao Boxiong's state:

"His eyes were bulging, his face was stern, and he spoke in a strange voice, speaking very quietly. When he heard that Miss Wang was not in, he snorted and went back out in a huff. I was so scared by him that a fish bone almost got stuck in my throat!"

In addition, she provided new evidence about Yu Gantang's actions:

She said, "The day before yesterday, on the evening of the 16th, after dinner, when I went out to buy matches and came back, I saw Young Master Yu lurking and peeking around at the door. I greeted him. He seemed startled and quickly told me not to make a sound. He even offered me a banknote, but I didn't take it—I didn't dare to."

Hawthorne asked, "Did he say anything to you?"

Wu Ma said, "He asked me if Miss Wang was in. I told him she wasn't. He also asked if Young Master Zhao had been coming lately. I said he came often. He nodded and quietly walked away again." (55)

### Seven Major Flaws

— By Xin Fang

Human beings are naturally bound to have flaws, so various kinds of errors often occur in everyone's life. Recently, a Western writer has identified seven major flaws common to mankind, which are now specially translated below for our generation to be wary of.

(1) Limiting personal progress to the principle of causing others to fall.

(2) Often getting upset about things that cannot be changed or corrected.

(3) Insisting that everything is impossible to do due to a lack of ability to accomplish it.

(4) Disregarding ordinary things and focusing on achieving success in great undertakings.

(5) Failing to develop our thoughts and minds through the habit of reading.

(6) Seeking to force others to trust me while hoping that others will not surpass me in life.

(7) Lacking the ability to cultivate the habit of saving money.

### The Responsibility of Teachers

— By Li Wu Gao

### Is There a Heavenly Father?

In our previous two articles in this newspaper, we mentioned natural disasters such as the calamities of the material world, floods, earthquakes, and mountain tsunamis, all of which cannot prove that there is no God. Because of these experiences of various disasters, mankind has developed methods of defense and the ability to control them, which in turn proves that there is a God who is creating mankind for the sake of human happiness. Now we want to discuss the difficulties of harmony in the animal world:

(2) Difficulties in the Animal World: People often say that the competition, fear, pain, suffering, and prevalence of disease and death among animals are enough to show God's cruelty and ruthlessness. We have also heard that nature is a large arena, where one animal often preys on and destroys another, which is consistent with the saying "big fish eat small fish, small fish eat worms." It is true that there is suffering and pain among animals, especially among higher and more sensitive animals. But it is not as serious or as frequent as we think. Nor should we assume that the suffering of animals is the same as the suffering of human beings. Because we humans have a kind of self-awareness that animals do not have. Our human memory and imagination are much greater than those of animals. Moreover, many human sufferings are due to an over-intensification of the anticipation of pain. For example, someone suffering from a toothache may anticipate that the pain of pulling the tooth will be even worse than the toothache itself. Animals do not seem to have such anticipations, so their suffering is not as great as that of humans.

It is also not entirely true to say that suffering dominates the natural world. As far as we can see, happiness ultimately outweighs suffering. For example, the sparrows in the trees, the lambs in the fields, and the wild rabbits often live freely and spontaneously. Even in nature, there are disputes and rivalries, but the mutual assistance and love among animals is enough to compensate for it.

What seems to evoke a sense of cruelty in the natural world is simply the problem of death. But death itself is a condition for the progress of both mankind and the animal kingdom. If there were no death, there would be no new life. If the living were to live forever, the happiness of life would be limited to the enjoyment of a few and could not be distributed to many descendants.

Modern science teaches us that suffering in nature has its meaning. This suffering is the path to obtaining security, survival, and preservation of the animal kingdom, and it is also an indispensable element in the overall system of the organic world, to satisfy God's great benevolent purpose. All these phenomena that are seen as painful by humans are God's arranged plans for the universe. Before we casually say that a benevolent and wise God is not good, we should always hesitate a little, adopt a skeptical attitude, and avoid the mockery of "blind men describing an elephant." (Reprinted on the 27th) (For this article, please refer to "Is There a Heavenly Father?" published by the Guangxuehui). Readers who wish to study in detail, please inquire to the Shanghai Aiwenyi Road No. 351, Text Evangelism Society, and there will be a detailed reply.

### Another New Contribution to Film History: Automatic Voice Changer

— By Xiande

The general public always feels unable to fully understand foreign films, the only reason being the language barrier. Therefore, many people are burying their heads in research, trying to find ways to improve it. Until recently, a Hollywood filmmaker, playwright, and physicist named Gilbert Wright spent two years of effort inventing a "Sonovox" automatic voice-changing machine, thus solving this problem. As for his motivation for researching this machine:

Motivation

It was like this: Once, Wright was supervising a film, in which there was a plot where a murderer, when escaping on a train, needed the wheels to emit a condemning sound of "You killed her! You killed her!" According to ordinary methods, that would only require recording the sound of the wheels on the one hand and adding the required human voice on the other. But Wright did not think so, he hoped that the wheels themselves could emit that needed sound. Many engineers thought it was impossible, but Wright relied on his knowledge of acoustics and electricity to finally achieve his goal. The

Appearance

of this machine is very simple and exquisite, there is only a sound box like a phonograph, and two biscuit-shaped vibrating plates connected to it with electric wires. As for the internal structure and principles, because it cannot be explained in a few words, I will not discuss it further here. Although this machine has a simple appearance, its

Function

is very broad. It can turn the Italian you speak into English; it can turn your hoarse singing voice into a clear one; therefore, after using this voice changer, anyone can understand the plays performed by foreign actors in their own language, and there will no longer be any need for any explanation on the screen. Undoubtedly, this machine will cause a major change in film history, like the advancement from silent films to sound films. This kind of

Voice Changing

device, in addition to being used in film, can also serve people who cannot speak due to illness or unfortunate accidents, allowing them to express their opinions with their mouths like everyone else. So this is also good news for the deaf and mute.

### British War Films Screened in Shanghai

— By Jinhuang

Mr. Alexander, Counselor of the British Embassy, recently hosted a screening of the latest war vehicle films at the British Women's Association Hall in the HSBC Building, inviting people from all walks of life to visit, and prepared exquisite cold drinks on the roof of the building for the guests. The evening breeze was gentle, and the summer heat was gone, and the guests and hosts were all happy.

The films screened all depicted the latest movements of the British army, navy, and air force, some of which were filmed during the battle, which was truly valuable. It began with the ranks of troops from Canada, Australia, and other places, followed by various exercises and combat situations in the African desert. The work of British aviation schools and ordnance factories, air combat and air force bombing of tank formations, etc., were all shown on the screen, as well as many wonderful shots, such as German planes bombing moving British and French troops, the Battle of Narvik, and the air raid on Namsos. Finally, there were the joint efforts of the British and French forces in escorting Dutch refugees during the bombing, the situation of Belgium being destroyed, and the joint operations of the navy and air force, which were quite wonderful, and the audience praised them endlessly.

### Teapot Songs

— Shaoqing

Watching Tan Fuying and Chen Lifang perform The Metamorphosis (Continued)

There were many high-pitched tunes flipped that day, which won a lot of applause. After a five-minute break, "Sangyuanhui" opened. Starting with the Luo woman reciting the introduction, Qiuhu's disguise and singing the next scene was omitted, saving time. Chen Lifang played Luo, her singing and acting purely learned from Cheng Yanqiu, her water sleeve skills were extremely good and could be mistaken for the real thing. Her voice was wider and brighter than when she sang "Nv Qijie" in the bubble opera on the first day, and her singing and acting were both well-rounded. Tan Fuying played Qiuhu, singing "Qiuhu Da Ma Ben Jiaxiang" [Qiuhu Rides Home on Horseback], flowing rhythm. Listening to his voice, it was also faster and smoother than before. "Qiuhu Ta Ba Liangxin Sang" [Qiuhu Has Lost His Conscience], inverted rhythm, singing the old tune, indeed adhering to the rules. Continuing to sing the Xibei inverted rhythm, there were quite a few good tunes, the sound was both broad and loud, and every sentence could be heard clearly. "Wo Quan Ta Huijia Ta Bu Wang" [I Advise Him to Go Home But He Does Not], one sentence, he sang the "Ta" character in one breath, the breath was sufficient and the spirit was complete. The duet quick beat segments were also extremely familiar. "Da Bu Gai Zai Sangyuan Tiaoxi Ta" [Should Not Have Teased Her in the Mulberry Garden] was sung in a flipped high pitch and was the most wonderful. Fuying's performance in this play was good in both singing and acting. He acted lively and spirited that day and was very popular with the audience. Listening closely to his singing in this play, there was no sound of a sad and declining tune, which was truly extraordinary. I most agree with this point. Since it is not a tragedy, why use a sad sound? Moreover, Qiuhu wears a black three-beard and is not very old, and the title is "Teasing His Wife," so there is even less need for sadness. Fuying knows the plot and understands the Sichuan sound. However, I think that Fuying has such a good voice and should further study the phonetics. Now I will give three characters that seem inappropriate: First, the "Hong Niang Xing" [Lying to My Mother] "Hong" character, the mouth is too open, and the ending sound is not clear; second, the "Ta Bu Wang" [He Does Not Go] "Wang" character, after using the tune, the rhyme should not change greatly. Now listening to the Jiangyang rhyme's vowel, every time there are several tones changed, this is a great taboo in singing. I heard that Fuying had this small flaw ten years ago, and I suspected that it was caused by his voice not recovering. Now his voice is smooth and his breath is sufficient, so why not urgently seek to change it? Third, the "Tiaoxi Ta" [Teasing Her] "Tiao" character, Yangping tone, should not use the "Fan" character high note. This is different from the word "Zao" [Disaster] in "Zhuo Fang Zao Huoyang" [Catching and Releasing Causes Disaster], which has a Yinping tone and should not be used with the "Fan" character sound uniformly. However, a high note should actually be used here to increase the momentum. In my humble opinion, if the "Tiao" character is changed to the "Yao" character with a rising tone, it would be suitable for using a high note. The performance of "Dayu Shajia" [The Fisherman's Revenge] started close to eleven o'clock. Because of the limited time, everyone rushed through the performance like they were snatching a play, so I will save ink and not discuss it.
