Editorial

### The Soviet Union and the Far East After the Soviet-Finnish Peace

Following the establishment of peace between the Soviet Union and Finland, Soviet-Japanese relations have once again entered a tense and delicate state: Although the rumor of a renewed clash at Nomonhan has been denied by the Japanese military as lacking common sense, disputes in the Sakhalin Island area have followed one after another. According to Japanese sources, on the 11th of this month, a Soviet aircraft flew into Japanese territory on the island, and on the 15th, a local conflict occurred between border guards from both sides. Regardless of the truth of the matter and how it evolves, this will undoubtedly draw the world's attention from the Gulf of Finland and the Karelian Isthmus to the winds and clouds on the Soviet-Japanese and Soviet-Manchukuo borders.

If one looks only at the surface of events, some may believe that the above-mentioned events are a manifestation of the Soviet Union's increasingly active Far Eastern policy, and thus harbor premature optimism. However, it is important to note that even while dealing with Finland with all its might, the Soviet Union has always maintained a strict level of vigilance in the Far East and has never had a passive moment. At the beginning of the Soviet-German non-aggression pact last autumn, the general view was that the Soviet Union was about to become tougher on Japan, but the next act was the cessation of hostilities at Nomonhan and the entry of Soviet troops into Poland. Although the Soviet Union's western border has now been absolutely secured and is no longer in danger of being invaded, in the current complex international situation, the Soviet Union may not take the threat from Japan as seriously as it seems, to the point of taking immediate action. Looking at the current facts, it is more reasonable to say that conflicts like the one on Sakhalin Island are more of an attempt by the Japanese to launch a new offensive against the Soviet Union than the Soviet Union becoming more active towards Japan.

The war between the Soviet Union and Finland, although resulting in the Soviet Union securing its western border, also led to the revival of the anti-Soviet movement in Western European countries. The international calls for aid to Finland and the measures taken were mainly driven by this anti-Soviet movement. Now that peace has been declared between the Soviet Union and Finland, the various events caused by that war should also come to an end in principle, such as the anti-Soviet movement. Perhaps in the minds of some people in Western Europe, the anti-Soviet sentiment is more important than the war against Germany, but this is not a healthy idea. If the relations between the Western powers and the Soviet Union continue to deteriorate, the Soviet-German alliance will become stronger, further exacerbating the difficulties of the Allied powers, and giving the aggressor Japan in the Far East a chance to profit from speculation, using the guise of anti-Sovietism as a basis for bargaining with the Allied powers, which is harmful to the Allied powers in every way. It has been almost ten years since the "September 18th Incident," and the sparks have long since expanded into a prairie fire. The chronic disease of the inability of the various powers to coordinate has not improved much. This is unfortunate for the Far East, and even more unfortunate for the powers themselves. Fortunately, China is still energetic and promising, independently shouldering the heavy responsibility of containing aggression, and dragging down the Japanese clique until they are exhausted. However, in international relations, the powers still leave the Japanese clique with room for maneuvering, allowing them to constantly oscillate between anti-British and anti-Soviet postures to carry out threats and intimidation. If this situation continues, it will not be China that suffers, but the powers themselves. Like the rumors of a secret Anglo-Japanese or Soviet-Japanese non-aggression pact, we believe that they are just baseless fabrications, but they sometimes have a subtle influence in the international arena. Now that the Japanese are conducting probes through anti-Sovietism again, its response is naturally worthy of attention. On the other hand, even if the Soviet Union is ready to take active action against Japan, it will inevitably have concerns due to mutual suspicion in the international community. Today, the positions of the various powers in the Far East are mostly firm and unwavering, and there is no room for doubt, but the lack of coordination between them is a major weakness, which urgently needs the efforts of those who care about the fate of the Far East.

Japan Expands Markets in South America; Gradually Concludes Commercial Treaties with South American Countries

Tokyo: Business circles here are deeply afraid that American economic power will penetrate into South America and Central America after the outbreak of the European war, and will eventually close the market for Japanese goods. At one time, a movement to dominate the South American market was launched here, but the huge competition from the United States has made business leaders here extremely worried. Japanese diplomats in the Western Hemisphere have suggested convening a round table conference in Washington, which will be attended by Japanese ambassadors and ministers to North, Central, and South American countries. The purpose is to find ways to prevent American economic power from further penetrating into Central and South American countries. Since the abolition of the Japanese-American commercial treaty in 1911, Japanese-American trade has been based on a day-to-day situation. Japan is eager to eliminate its dependence on the United States, so it wants to find markets to sell its products and wants to buy its necessities from other markets. The Argentine government has sent an economic mission to Tokyo. Although no decision has been announced by either party, it is generally believed that a larger-scale basis for mutual trade between the two countries has been built. Mexico and Paraguay also plan to send similar missions to Japan. The Japanese-Uruguayan commercial treaty, which had been piling up in the files for several years, was taken out of the dust a few weeks ago and has now been submitted to the Privy Council for final approval. Japan is working hard in Peru, Chile, Bolivia, and other Latin American countries to find ways to increase Japan's mutual trade with these countries. The two sides are negotiating barter arrangements. Japan plans to exchange raw silk and cotton fabrics for raw cotton, canned food, and, where possible, kerosene. The breakdown of the US-Argentina reciprocal trade negotiations has greatly pleased Japan. Some people believe that Japanese trade has gained good results in entering Latin America.

### US President Appeals to the World to Seek a Moral Peace: If Human Life is Dominated by Force, Peace Will Be Difficult to Sound and Lasting

Washington: President Roosevelt had a slight cold a few days ago but has now recovered. Last night, he participated in the international radio broadcast program initiated by the Christian Church.

Washington: President Roosevelt declared in a broadcast to the world yesterday that the world is seeking a true peace that is sufficient to guarantee the sovereignty of small countries and the freedom of religious culture. "We should seek today a peace based on morality. If the whole world cannot become brothers, there will be no true peace. If the fruits of peace are oppression, hunger, cruelty, or weapons are superior to humanity, then peace will not last long. If small countries live under the threat of powerful countries, then peace will not be solid. If freedom is deprived by aggression, then there will be no moral peace. If the will and thoughts of mankind are suppressed, there will be no reasonable peace. If God is denied, there will be no upright peace. From the end of the last European war to today's European war, the world has not had a peace based on this." (17th United Press Telegraph)

### The Future of War and Peace in Europe: Only Roosevelt Sees Clearly: Anglo-French Policy Suffers Twofold Failure: Turkey Needs Ten Years of Peace

Rome: As of last night, how many chances are there for the Anglo-French-German war to end? Aside from Mussolini, who knows a little, there are only two people who understand the overall situation: US President Roosevelt and Under Secretary of State Welles. Only they know that this trip is in vain. Mr. Welles, in his capacity as a mediator, has been traveling between Rome, Berlin, Paris, and London, using his eloquent tongue to attempt to discover possible conditions that Roosevelt can use as a basis to mediate the European war and make the hope of peace a reality. It has been three weeks. Now, before returning to his country, Mr. Welles has come here again and held a second meeting with Mr. Mussolini last night. Therefore, it seems that peace or war is still uncertain. Recalling when Mr. Welles first decided to negotiate with Mr. Mussolini and his son-in-law Ciano, the British and French were searching for new battlefields and seeking strategists. The Siegfried Line is as solid as gold, firmly rejecting the Entente powers outside the German western border, and the Entente powers have also realized that they cannot enter Germany without risking wrongdoing by violating the neutrality of several countries. Now, when Mr. Welles is having final talks with Mr. Mussolini and others for the sake of peace, it is heard that London and Paris are still insisting on their opinions and saying that they are looking for a way to test the power of real war. However, the two sides have been at war for six and a half months, and the Entente powers have not been able to find a place from which to inflict an effective blow on Germany. As for Germany, apart from passing through the Maginot Line, there is no other way to directly attack the Allied powers. Since Mr. Welles arrived here on the 25th of last month, the European situation has undergone great changes. All Europeans say that Finland's failure to formally ask Britain and France for assistance is a failure of British and French diplomacy, and they say that Finland does not seem to trust the Allied powers, so it negotiated peace with the Soviet Union without consulting with Britain and France. The military policies and diplomatic policies of the British and French governments are currently being criticized from all sides, and intense debates are also taking place in domestic public opinion. Some people in both countries are demanding war with the Soviet Union, believing that this is the only way to attack Germany. However, Turkey's policy is contrary to what is widely rumored. Turkey does not want to become a battlefield, just like the Scandinavian countries. So how will the Allied powers attack the Soviet Union? People close to the Turkish government told reporters, "Turkey will never sign a treaty that directly opposes the Soviet Union. Therefore, in the alliance between Turkey and Britain and France, there is not a single word that would oblige Turkey to fight against the Soviet Union if the Allied powers were to fight against the Soviet Union. Turkey needs at least ten years of peace. The losses suffered by Turkey from the earthquake are very serious, and the number of people killed and injured exceeds the total number of killed and injured in the German attack on Poland, which is many times more than the losses suffered by the Allied powers in the so-called war for six months." Therefore, the Germans sit comfortably behind the Siegfried Line and call out to the Allied powers, "Come," but the Allied powers cannot find a battlefield, so the war is in a dilemma, which is probably the only biggest factor that favors Mr. Welles' mission. However, at the same time, it is heard that Italy is declaring that millions of Italian youths have received military training and are well-equipped, including three army corps ready to be formed. Also, according to diplomatic sources here, Germany, Italy, the Soviet Union, Hungary, and Romania plan to form a group, but this saying has not yet been confirmed.

### Italy and the European War (Written by Guido, Editor-in-Chief of the Italian Daily)

Six months have passed since the outbreak of the European war. People often ask each other, "What is Italy's opinion?" Among the major European countries, only Italy has not been involved in the war. In addition, Prime Minister Mussolini's publicly stated Italian policy only regards itself as a non-belligerent country and has not declared neutrality. It can be seen that Italy is not completely outside the current war. For this reason, Italy's views and attitudes are extremely important for the future of the European war. Its influence is very important and decisive. This is very obvious. On the Italian side, it is deeply felt that the current war will definitely be protracted, and the number of victories and defeats cannot be foreseen, and the consumption must be huge. Although it is generally recognized that this war is a useless move, the participating countries will not stop fighting until they are exhausted. However, since the beginning of the war, all extremely predictions have been denied by the facts. For example, large-scale air raids have not yet been realized. The reason is that both sides do not want to start first, so as to avoid retaliation from the other side. Therefore, the terrible air war is avoided because of its terribleness. At the same time, both sides on land are also hesitant to carry out mobile warfare and dare not imitate Napoleonic or Prussian tactics to launch attacks decisively. This situation, rather than saying that it is because the French Maginot Line and the German Siegfried Line are both impregnable, and both sides have their own reliance, so they are self-restrained and do not attack. The reason is that both sides have different measures of the way of war, which is more accurate. As far as Germany is concerned, after conquering Poland, it declared that there was no need to fight on the Western Front and did not want to be the head of the army. Although Britain and France are rich in assets, their domestic population is not as large as that of Germany, so it is necessary to save manpower. Therefore, their war foundation focuses on the economic, political, and social aspects, while the military aspect is secondary. In short, these countries expect to use severe

Static means to surround Germany

Consuming its resources, cutting off its supplies, so that it can gradually weaken its resistance without having to fight a large-scale war, so as to achieve victory. The different measures of both sides have led to this situation. Therefore, the number of victories and defeats is even more unpredictable, and the degree of consumption from beginning to end can be known. The reason why Britain and France adopted this strategy is based on estimating how long Germany's resistance can last. It is known that various statistics are often not enough to measure the strength of resistance. In the past, Italy's conquest of Abyssinia and the implementation of sanctions by various countries failed, which is its lesson. As far as Germany is concerned during this war, it must have been fully prepared both materially and spiritually. In the past few years, Germany has accumulated a large number of raw materials such as steel, iron, copper, rubber, and cotton, all of which are abundant. In terms of economy, it can be self-sufficient and has huge cash reserves. This cash is divided into four categories. First, in the era when the mark fell miserably, it had already accumulated huge amounts of gold and foreign exchange. At that time, countries around the world competed for speculation, and Germany was able to exchange its valueless paper money for gold and foreign exchange. Second, it obtained a lot of gold commercial loans in the United States. Third, its foreign trade surplus has been very large in recent years. Fourth, since annexing Austria and the Czech Republic, it has incorporated the reserves of the banks of these countries into the Deutsche Bank. In addition to the four, the static and virtual strategies adopted by Britain and France for the past six months have also enabled Germany to save military supplies and step up manufacturing to cultivate strength. However, this is delayed day after day until finally the country's resistance will definitely disappear completely, which can be asserted. However, Britain and France also

Inevitable to suffer serious damage

The impact is not limited to economic and financial matters, and may even extend to imperial interests. The wider the distribution of these interests, the more fragile they are.

Based on this, how the victory or defeat of this war will be, from the perspective of us Italians, although it cannot be foreseen, it is undoubtedly unfavorable to Europe. Prime Minister Mussolini, in view of this, has made every effort to prevent it from arising and to curb it after it has occurred. However, Britain and France are boasting about their economic and financial superiority, the world's sea power, and the universality of political power, believing that this is the way to victory and that they can control it. From the boasting of Britain and France, we associate with the so-called "reconstruction of Europe" issue. This issue is often talked about by the belligerent countries. Considering the current situation in the world, a few countries have strong strength, so before the war, they were confident that they had a good chance of winning. In addition to their monopoly and control, how can Europe maintain balance, and how can peace be guaranteed? The cause and effect in this are obvious and cannot be avoided. The reason is that Europe's resources have never been fairly distributed in accordance with the quality of each country's ethnic group and human rights and civil rights. This situation has become even worse since the establishment of the Treaty of Versailles. As a result, the European political situation has been turbulent for twenty years, and finally led to this great war. Tracing back to the source and looking forward, the new Europe should be the result of glorious peace, and it must

Establish balance as a major prerequisite

Otherwise, even if you want to transform it, you cannot get it. In addition, Britain and France still have one point that they often boast about, believing that Britain controls the throat of access to the Mediterranean Sea and can arbitrarily block it. This view can be seen in the newspapers of these countries. What is the purpose of such publicity? Do you want to warn Italy that it should be like a prisoner if it belongs to the Mediterranean? This kind of attitude of Britain and France is also very different from the meaning of freedom and equality that the new European countries must have. In Italy, the concept of the so-called new Europe is very simple, that is, Italy does not want to obtain any privileges in Europe or in the world. For any system, all those who directly or indirectly enable one or several countries to obtain hegemony are opposed. However, it must be said separately that Italy still has several issues that are vital to its survival that have not yet been resolved. The countries of the Versailles system not only failed to solve these problems but aggravated them. In short, these problems must be resolved in accordance with Italy's needs, and it is already urgent. On this point, the major European countries must thoroughly understand. Original

Italy needs nothing more than two things

First, it needs free and rich space for the development of the Italian people, so that they can work peacefully within Italian territory. Second, the Italian nation needs freedom of life and action and should have the right to eliminate all foreign-controlled systems. It is firmly believed that these needs can be resolved outside the "Versailles stance" and in a more fair and sound Europe. So how should this new Europe be composed? War or peace? Which way to go is difficult to predict. Since all countries do not want to be outside this organization, they do not take the position of neutral countries. Although they have no direct relationship with the war at present, they are prepared to maintain a position of influence in future wars and peace. Therefore, they are paying close attention to the evolution of this decisive European war and various situations. What is hoped is that the new Europe can be completed without expanding the war. Therefore, Italy's policy has always been to prevent the expansion of the scope of the war. Although the extent to which the European war can be expanded depends on the political and military plans of the belligerent countries, the Balkan Peninsula and the Mediterranean Sea are currently under threat, but the policy that Italy has grasped has already achieved something. Since the Soviet Union's power has invaded the Danube River basin and threatened the Balkan Peninsula, new problems have arisen in Europe. It must be known whether Italy has

Never ignore the communist threat

This is because Italy's position has the potential to support the Danube River countries, and it has become a very large country in the Balkan Peninsula. Its interests in this area have a permanent and survival-related nature. However, Italy has no aggressive plans against the Soviet Union, which is very different from other powers. The reason is that Italy's main purpose is only to prevent the spread of communism and eliminate the threat to the sound system of European civilization. To sum up, Italy's policy towards communism is essentially an inseparable part of establishing a sound and civilized European policy. The Soviet Union can rest easy within its borders, and Italy has no intention of hostility. On the contrary, if communism attempts to invade Europe and the area of Italy's survival interests, then Fascism knows how to deal with it (Translated by Havas Agency)

### Finland Sends Representatives to the Soviet Union to Handle Exchange of Documents, Resolve Outstanding Issues Between the Two Countries, and Basikivi Describes the Course of Peace Negotiations

Helsinki: After the House of Representatives passed the Soviet-Finnish peace treaty, President Kallio has recently approved it. Cabinet Minister Basikivi is scheduled to lead a delegation to Moscow on the 18th of this month to exchange ratification documents with the Soviet authorities. At the same time, negotiations will continue on various unresolved issues, especially the re-demarcation of the border between the two countries, economic talks, and the restoration of diplomatic relations. According to a message from the official radio station, in accordance with Article 7 of the treaty, the ratification documents of both parties should be exchanged in Moscow within ten days of the treaty's establishment. Therefore, President Kallio authorized Basikivi to go to Moscow to handle this procedure, but the date of the exchange of ratification documents has not yet been determined and will be decided by the Soviet government at that time. (16th Havas Telegraph)

Helsinki: Cabinet Minister Basikivi recently made a statement to foreign reporters, saying that the border line drawn by this peace treaty is in fact not much different from the border line when Russia's Peter the Great bought Finnish territory from Sweden in 1721. When we were negotiating with the Soviet authorities in Moscow a few days ago, the Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov mentioned the name of Peter the Great twice. In total, we met eight times in Molotov's office, and Stalin himself never came out to participate. This is completely different from the situation last autumn. Also, when we were in Moscow, we only met with the envoys of so and so countries. Who they were is not convenient to tell. In short, when we were negotiating in Moscow, all our actions were extremely cautious, so that the Soviet authorities would not suspect that we were carrying out any conspiracy. As a result of the negotiations between the two sides, there were some amendments to the draft peace treaty, but they were all of a secondary nature, such as the amendment of the withdrawal date of the Red Army troops, etc., which were all irrelevant. As for the provision in the peace treaty that the Soviet authorities may build a railway line between the cities of Kemiärvi and Kondalahti, it was not included in the original plan proposed by that country. It is absolutely not true that the peace treaty is attached with secret clauses. In addition, there is one more thing to note, that is, when Molotov and I were negotiating, he only mentioned the name of Kuusinen (i.e., the Chairman of the "Finnish People's Government") once when discussing other issues. Although Article 3 of the peace treaty stipulates that the signatory countries must avoid attacking each other and must not conclude alliance treaties with countries that oppose either party, our country's proposal to conclude a defense alliance treaty with Norway and Sweden does not conflict with this clause, because if this treaty is established, it is not aimed at the Soviet Union, but at all countries that intend to attack us.

### Residents Migrate from Finnish Ceded Areas, War-Torn Aftermath, Domestic Order Gradually Restored

Helsinki: Tens of thousands of Finns with sad faces are now continuing to leave the ceded areas, either by train, streetcar, sled, or on foot, all eager to complete their migration in a short period of time. People across the country have temporarily suspended travel except for absolutely necessary matters in order to free up vehicles for migration. A Reuters special correspondent traveled on a train between Helsinki and Turku. There was no space on the train. The stations seen along the way were all bombed by Soviet planes and were not intact. Fire insurance experts estimate that the damage caused by air raids in Finnish cities is no less than ten million British pounds. Life in various parts of the country is now gradually returning to normal, and schools are scheduled to reopen in April. (17th Reuters Telegraph)

### Finnish, Swedish, and Norwegian Defense Alliance: Now Possible to Realize, Denmark's Attitude Is Cold, Sweden Intensifies Training of Reserve Soldiers

Copenhagen: Reliable sources here said that a secret meeting will be held in the Swedish capital within days to discuss the conclusion of a joint defense alliance between the Nordic countries. Norwegian Speaker of Parliament Hambro and former Finnish Prime Minister Kallio arrived in Stockholm today. The Danish newspaper "Politiken" revealed this morning the attitude of the Danish people towards the conclusion of the alliance, saying that Denmark is now preparing to withdraw from the Nordic group, and if the Swedish, Norwegian, and Finnish talks conclude that it is necessary to conclude an alliance, Denmark does not intend to join. (17th Haitong Telegraph)

Helsinki: Authoritative sources here said yesterday that the possibility of Sweden concluding an alliance with Finland and Norway has greatly increased in the past few days. Swedish newspapers and public opinion unanimously support the conclusion of the alliance. At the same time, outside personnel solemnly denied the possibility of Germany participating in the alliance. Currently, there are two German military representatives in Stockholm, but they have not yet contacted the Swedish military authorities. It is heard that the content of the Finnish-Norwegian-Swedish alliance is as follows: (1) The signatory countries agree that mutual assistance clauses will take effect when any country is invaded; (2) No signatory country may conclude an alliance with other countries, otherwise this treaty will be invalid; (3) If a war occurs due to the implementation of the alliance, a signatory country must seek the consent of the other two countries before obtaining foreign aid; (4) This convention is purely defensive and does not contain any aggressive intent or preparation for recovering lost territory; (5) After a certain period of time (approximately five years), this treaty must be re-signed or canceled; (6) When necessary, the military staff groups of the signatory countries may hold talks to supplement the shortcomings of the various defense clauses. (17th United Press Telegraph)

Stockholm: In order to create a strong and independent Nordic region, the Swedish government has decided to summon reserve soldiers of the 1932 to 1936 classes for training. At the same time, the training period for reserve soldiers of the 1938 to 1940 classes will be increased from 175 days to 240 days. (17th Haitong News Agency)

### Panama President Protests to Britain Again, Claims British Ship's Interception of German Ship Violates Pan-American Neutrality Principles

Washington – Regarding the incident of the German freighter "Wiega-mar" sinking itself on February 12 in Brazilian waters when confronted by a British warship, the Republic of Panama has lodged a protest with the British government on behalf of the twenty-one American republics. The U.S. State Department has issued a public statement stating that the President of the Republic of Panama, Boyd, sent a note to the British Chargé d'Affaires in Panama on February 14, stating, "According to a report from the Brazilian government, the German freighter 'Wiega-mar' was intercepted by a warship of Your Majesty's government on February 12, clearly with the intention of inspecting and detaining it, and was scuttled by its own crew fifteen miles off the coast of Brazil. According to Article 13 of the Hague Convention, the actions of Your Majesty's warship constitute an act of hostility. Moreover, this incident occurred within the territorial waters of the American continent. The twenty-one American republics unanimously consider this fact to be a violation of the principles previously established by all Pan-American nations in the capital of Panama. Therefore, the President is authorized to lodge a protest and request that Your Majesty's government not allow the war to expand into the territorial waters of the American continent, as this territorial sea is the route for peaceful commerce for all American nations."

### Moscow Communist Party Holds Congress

Moscow – The joint congress of the Moscow City and Moscow District Communist Party opened on March 15. Secretary Shcherbakov reported on the development of Moscow City and Moscow District. Shcherbakov said, "In 1939, the total output of Moscow City and Moscow District was 17,497,000,000 rubles, accounting for 23.7% of the total output of the Soviet Union. From 1938 to 1939, the output of the Moscow District increased by 38.5% compared with 1937. The national defense industry has also made great achievements. In the past two years, the total trade volume of Moscow City has increased by 30%, and the total volume of Moscow District has increased by 34%. In 1932, according to the budget of the Moscow Soviet, a total of 1,500,000,000 rubles was used for education, health, and other municipal improvements." The congress also sent a telegram to Stalin, saying, "The signing of the Soviet-Finnish peace treaty has dealt a fatal blow to international war provocateurs. They have lost one of the most important bases for attacking the Soviet Union. Stalin's peaceful diplomacy has achieved victory." (TASS dispatch, 16th)

### Norway Lodges Strong Protest with Germany over German Submarine Sinking Norwegian Ship, Reserves Right to Claim Compensation for Losses

Oslo – After the Norwegian ship "Nidaro-holm" was sunk by a German submarine with torpedoes on February 12, the government authorities lodged a strong protest with the German government. A communiqué was issued stating, "On February 12, our country's ship 'Nidaro-holm' was sailing in the Irish Sea when it encountered a German submarine. The submarine immediately fired three shots before launching torpedoes to sink it. At that time, our country's crew members had already escaped on lifeboats. The submarine then fired three more shots, fortunately missing. The crew members floated on the sea for nine hours before being rescued by a Norwegian ship. Our country's minister to Germany, Hill, visited German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop on the 15th of this month, informing him that the German submarine sank our country's ship without inspection and did not take any steps to ensure the safety of the crew according to the provisions of the London Protocol of November 6, 1936 (of which Germany is also a signatory). This is a violation of international law. Therefore, we lodge a strong protest and reserve the right to claim compensation for losses, hoping that the German government can take appropriate steps to punish the submarine commander."

### British and French Cabinets to be Reorganized, Strengthening Wartime Agencies

London – Diplomatic sources here have stated that after the establishment of the Soviet-Finnish peace, a political issue has emerged in Britain and France, namely whether the powers of the respective national cabinets can be strengthened to facilitate military operations, such as reducing the number of cabinet members and forming a true wartime cabinet, without each cabinet member being solely in charge of a department. The intention is to strengthen the activities of the governments of both countries in all aspects. In Britain, it is said that Prime Minister Chamberlain will consider this issue during the Easter holiday, but it is generally expected that there will be no major changes other than the three departments of the Army, Air Force, and Military Supplies.

### Zhu Jiahua Discusses the European War, with No Disadvantage to China (Continued), China's Diplomacy Is Skillful and Bears an Important Mission of World Peace, 6. The European War and China

In summary, Britain and France are in a superior economic position, but relying solely on economic power to force Germany to surrender, even if achievable, can only happen in the distant future. The international situation is constantly changing, and every event can affect the war situation. At present, both warring parties are striving to seek allies to increase their own strength and inspire their national morale. However, neutral countries are overwhelmed with bewilderment and fear, and because of bewilderment and fear, they observe and hesitate, and try to please both sides. This state is also one of the reasons for the slow spread of the European war.

Before the war began, the diplomatic war had already exhausted its capabilities. The theory of old military strategists that "all political claims in wartime are issued from the barrel of a gun" has been completely destroyed by modern shrewd politicians. To predict the future of the European war, we must first recognize that when this war broke out, it had already revealed the outlines of a world war. Except for the possibility of a successful compromise midway, it is a very natural and mediocre thing for the European war to evolve into a worldwide war. A spark can start a prairie fire, especially with China's war of resistance against Japan in the Far East, which is about to enter its fourth year, and the fierce Soviet-Finnish war in Northern Europe.

Secondly, what we should recognize is the correlation and even inseparability of the Sino-Japanese War and the European War. At present, the violent Japan is being held back by China and cannot do anything or take advantage of the situation. It can be said that China has fulfilled an infinitely great responsibility to the world.

How the European war will develop, we are not in a position to make a hasty judgment, but we believe that the impact of a compromise midway or the prolongation of the European war will not be unfavorable to us. This is because our national policy of resistance has long been determined, and the foundation of two years and eight months of resistance is unshakeable. Our diplomacy is in our own hands and can be used skillfully.

However, we must firmly grasp the opportunity of this European war, passively crushing Japan's aggression politics, and actively completing our task of national revival. In particular, we must make the whole world recognize how important the mission that China bears for the entire world peace is, and how great its contribution to the world is. Then, how just and legitimate is the reward that China should receive - freedom, independence, sovereignty, and administrative integrity? (End)

### Foreign Ratepayers' Annual Meeting Proposals, Taxpayers Closely Watch, If Proposal to Increase Taxes is Raised, It Will Become the Focus of Fierce Debate

The Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the Public Concession, previously due to a resolution of the Board of Directors of the Municipal Council to levy an additional 50% on municipal rates and land rates starting from July 1, which was to be submitted to the Western Ratepayers' Annual Meeting for discussion, was addressed by the Citizens' Federation, stating the citizens' inability to bear the burden, and requesting the withdrawal of the original proposal. After the Chinese Ratepayers' Association forwarded a letter of protest to the Municipal Council, a letter of reply was received from the Municipal Council stating that this protest would be submitted to the Board of Directors for consideration without fail.

Annual Meeting Procedures

The annual meeting of foreign ratepayers in the Public Concession for this year has been scheduled for April 17. The election of directors and property committee members will be held on April 10 and 11. The Municipal Council has now decided to reappoint Mr. Blunt as the one Municipal Council representative to the Property Committee. Mr. Blunt has represented the Municipal Council on the Property Committee for ten years. The agenda of this year's foreign ratepayers' annual meeting will remain as usual, with the chairman delivering a speech and reporting on the situation over the past year, followed by a discussion of the municipal annual budget and final accounts. It is also said that the procedural rules for the foreign ratepayers' annual meeting will be revised this year to make the meeting procedures more orderly and clear.

Focus of Debate

As for the proposal to increase the municipal rates, special property rates, and land rate surcharges by 50% from July 1 of this year, it is still unknown whether this proposal will be suspended due to opposition from various parties. As the foreign annual meeting is imminent, all parties are paying close attention to it. However, it is generally expected that if this proposal is indeed raised at the annual meeting, it will become the center of fierce debate, as Chinese and foreign taxpayers alike are unwilling and indeed unable to bear any further burdens at this difficult time.

Opinions of the Hospitality Industry

Hotel industry colleagues, due to the Municipal Council's decision to increase the overall rate, are facing an excessive burden. A few days ago, they sent a letter to the Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the Public Concession and the Chinese Director of the Municipal Council, Yu Qiaqing, appealing for the reversal of this decision. It is now learned that when the industry receives a reply, it will convene a meeting to discuss how to respond. According to a Mr. from the Hotel Association yesterday, the Municipal Council's increase in taxes on 150-160 Chinese-style medium-sized hotels will make it difficult for the industry to bear. Since the war, the prices of various goods have risen several times, while the increase in room rates by the industry has only been 40%. Therefore, it is already difficult for the industry to maintain current operations, let alone bear heavier taxes. According to the current Municipal Council's taxation of the industry, it will increase from 40 yuan per quarter to more than 130 yuan.

### Valuation Committee Discusses Standard Market Price of Lump Coal, Coal Merchants Unwilling to Hoard and Suppress Prices for Shipment, Plan to Continue Selling Coal Balls at Low Prices

Since the establishment of the Valuation Committee by the authorities of the two concessions, after repeated discussions, it has been generally agreed that the soaring prices of goods are caused by hoarding and manipulation, especially for rice and coal. The committee has paid close attention to the coal price, and has sent personnel to the coal industry and coal ball associations to inquire about the root causes of the rise in various types of coal lumps, as well as the manufacturing costs of coal balls and the source of coal dust, and has urged the coal industry association to register coal lumps to facilitate statistics. It is now learned that the Valuation Committee is discussing specific standards for the sale price of coal lumps, which will be implemented. On the one hand, it intends to urge the coal industry to transport as much as possible to increase inventory. Now major firms have successively reduced prices for shipment and are unwilling to hoard to avoid losses and punishment.

Continuing Low-Price Sales

The low-price sale of coal balls has been in effect for more than two weeks since it began, and the situation in various places is very good. It has now reached its end, but the industry intends to continue to do so for the benefit of the common people. The industry association has scheduled a joint meeting of all factories at 3:00 pm on the 20th of this month at the hall on Tianjin Road to discuss the proper method in order to discuss it at length. It is heard that at that time, the supply of flat balls and flat selling location procedures of each factory will be presented for discussion and improvement, and the coal ball firms that sell at flat prices will also be strongly encouraged to continue to take on the task.

Opinions of Coal Merchants

Since the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, together with various relevant coal industry groups, agreed on a price limit for coal balls in the city, it is now 210 yuan per ton and 5.8 yuan per dan. Because the cost of each coal ball factory is huge, it has sent a letter to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce for relief. A reporter from the New Life News Agency specially visited a coal merchant yesterday to ask for opinions on relieving the coal ball factory. According to a certain person, (1) if coal balls are not sold at flat prices, please consider increasing the market price; (2) the number of coal balls sold at flat prices and the location of the flat sales should be increased to make them more widespread; (3) the flat selling date should be based on the market price of coal balls. If the coal balls fall to within 100 yuan or within 50 yuan, they should be stopped immediately; (4) to increase the number of flat ball purchases, it is best to limit each person to one yuan each time, and record it for reference.

Firewood and Charcoal are Transported to Shanghai

After the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce came forward to find a solution to the fuel problem in the Shanghai market as a whole, the market price of coal lumps and firewood charcoal has begun to fall. The spot goods in the market have doubled. According to news from the firewood charcoal industry yesterday, as the number of Shanghai-Ningbo flights has increased, the Wenzhou-Taizhou firewood charcoal piled up in Ningbo ports has been continuously loaded onto ships and transported to Shanghai for regulation. Because loose packing and basket packing are different, the number of shipments to the port cannot be counted. Now, in order to increase inventory and eliminate panic, the industry has been issuing certificates to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce for several days and continuing to send personnel to purchase from the Zhejiang production area, so the panic of fuel in Shanghai can be relieved invisibly.

### The Third Phase of Low-Priced Rice Sales Will be Held Tomorrow, The Undertaking Rice Shops Have Changed Slightly, The Location is in a Busy Area, I am Deeply Afraid that Incidents Will Occur at that Time, The Work of Selling Tickets and Distributing Rice Must Not be Exchanged Privately

The Shanghai Low-Priced Rice Sales Committee entrusted the Rice Shop Industry Association to handle the third phase of the low-priced rice sales of tribute rice, which was decided to be implemented from 1:00 pm tomorrow. In addition to the promulgation of the announcement by the police bureaus of the two concessions, ordering the rice purchasing crowds to observe order and not cause incidents, the Shanghai Rice Shop Industry Association also received an order from the French Concession Police Department yesterday. Among the 80 low-priced rice shops announced previously, one or two locations were on traffic arteries. In case of crowded crowds, incidents are unavoidable. It is necessary to change the location separately. The low-priced rice shops that have been re-assigned by the Rice Shop Industry Association are now announced as follows.

Reassigned

(1) Wanfeng Rice Shop, No. 6 Xiafei Road, will be changed to Yuanfeng Rice Shop, No. 332 Mintiniyin Road to sell tickets, (2) Zhenhengchang Rice Shop Ticket Office, No. 52 Bair Road, will be changed to Yixing Rice Shop Branch Ticket Office, No. 32 Xin Yong'an Street (3) Hengkang Rice Shop, No. 89 Bair Road, will be changed to Changtaixing Rice Shop, No. 37 Lao Yong'an Street to distribute rice, and the Rice Shop Industry Association, taking into account the circumstances in which the ticket sellers and rice distributors of the first and second phases of the low-priced rice shops exchanged work, which is contrary to the proposal, so it is notified to all industries that the designated low-priced rice shops must abide by the resolution during the third phase of the low-priced dates, and must not privately change the designated work.

Rice Prices Plummet

A reporter from the New Life News Agency learned from the rice industry yesterday that the source of Guomi, japonica, and indica rice has become stronger recently. About 10,000 bags arrive by land and water every day. It is heard that Suzhou, Changshu, and Wuxi are the main ones, followed by Jiaxing and Jiashan, and Wuhu indica goods also arrive every other day. Therefore, the inventory of rice warehouses in Shanghai is increasing day by day, and people's hearts have become stable. The market transaction is also moving towards the right track, and the prices of Guomi and foreign rice are plummeting daily. Yesterday, foreign rice plummeted by 1 yuan and 45 cents, and the rest were down by a small amount of 1 yuan or 7 or 8 cents. Therefore, there is no shortage of people's food in Shanghai as a whole, and it is expected that rice prices will tend to fall. Also, the Rice Industry Tea Market issued Public Announcement No. 127 yesterday, saying, "According to a joint letter from more than 70 colleagues, it is very inconvenient for warehouses and silver firms to take a holiday every Sunday. Collect public opinions and plan to take a holiday one day a week as a general rule. The 66th Management Committee meeting has approved this, allowing a holiday one day a week every Sunday from April of the Republic of China. If it is necessary for business operations, the holiday can be canceled at any time, etc., recorded in the records, and corresponding public announcements are made for all to know. This announcement.

### Post Offices in Both Concessions Refuse to Accept Japanese Military Scrip; One-Sided Implementation by Post Office; Not Even in Use in Occupied Areas

Since the Shanghai Postal Administration yielded to Japanese demands, allowing the public to purchase stamps or open drafts with Japanese military scrip, very few people have been using the scrip at post offices. This is especially true in the Concession areas. The Universal News Agency reporter has compiled the following details:

Purchasing Stamps

Since the Shanghai Postal Administration agreed to allow the public to purchase various stamps with Japanese currency and military scrip, the general public has shown a strong sense of righteousness and has refrained from using the scrip. Only a small number of people in post offices in occupied areas have used the Japanese military scrip, while the vast majority still use legal tender, as legal tender remains the only currency in circulation in occupied areas. Furthermore, the regulations for purchasing stamps with Japanese currency and military scrip are limited to Hongkou and post offices in occupied areas. Post offices in the Concessions do not accept them.

Opening Drafts

Recently, the Administration unilaterally agreed to allow the opening of drafts to Hankou and Jiujiang with Japanese military scrip, but this is also limited to post offices in occupied areas. Branches in the Concessions do not comply. Only post offices in the Shanghai suburbs of Hongkou, Heng Road, Nan Shi, Zhoujin Road, Laoximen, and Pudong Lanni Ferry handle this. However, very few people have been opening drafts with Japanese military scrip recently.

### Excess Profits Tax on Lunar Calendar Settlements; Calculation Method: Add One-Tenth of Full Year's Tax

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday notified its affiliated trade associations: "We are writing to inform you that on the 16th of this month, we received a letter from the Income Tax Affairs Office of the Ministry of Finance, stating that according to Instruction No. 11605 of the Ministry of Finance, the revised Excess Profits Tax Ordinance for Extraordinary Periods, Section 2, Paragraph 2 stipulates that the excess profits tax shall be levied from January 1, 1939. This should be complied with. However, businesses in various locations that calculate based on the business year generally use the period from the beginning to the end of the lunar calendar year as a business year, and settle at the end of the lunar calendar year. From the aforementioned levy date of January 1, 1939, to the end of the 17th year of the lunar calendar (i.e., February 18, 1939, of the Gregorian calendar), there are a total of 49 days. The profits during this period should also be taxed according to law. The calculation method shall be the same as the established method for the Category I income tax, which is to add one-tenth of the full-year excess profits tax for 1939 to simplify the calculation. This is more lenient than the established method for Category I income tax, which only taxes income for 40 days and adds one-tenth. This is being issued for compliance."

### Illegal Premium System Nearing Complete Elimination; 2.5 Million Yuan of Fractional Currency Issued

Following the Ministry of Finance's order to the Central, China, Communications, and Farmers Banks to regulate the shortage of fractional currency notes in the Shanghai market, there are now sufficient fractional and one-yuan currency notes in circulation. The fractional currency substitute notes previously issued by various businesses, except for the tram and bus companies, have gradually been recalled. Businesses are now using fractional currency notes for change. In the past, the premium for exchanging legal tender for fractional notes reached as high as 15 yuan per 100 yuan, and the premium for one-yuan notes was 25 yuan per 1,000 yuan. Now, this illegal premium system is nearing complete elimination. Although small money changers are listing a premium of 5 yuan per 1,000 yuan for one-yuan notes and 3 yuan per 100 yuan for fractional notes, there is little demand. Regarding the fractional currency notes approved for issuance by the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank, 2.5 million yuan has already been issued. Further issuances will continue based on market demand. These fractional currency notes are printed by the American Yongning Company and issued solely by the Shanghai branch of the bank. However, many have been circulated inland and are still generally accepted.

### Ningbo Lighterage Company Rice-Carrying Sailboat Sinks

The Ningbo Shipping Lighterage Company's No. 68 large sailboat (commonly known as a "Lutan boat"), license number 968, was transporting 150 bags of rice for the Ningbo Food Company from the "Moufuku" wheel outside the port on the evening of the 13th. It arrived in Ningbo and was moored in the river in front of the Hongxing Wharf, scheduled to be unloaded in the evening. However, around 1:00 AM, while the captain was still asleep, a Baiguan boat collided with it violently. The Lutan boat itself was already old, and after this impact, the caulking in the hull cracked and water immediately began to seep in. By the time the boat owner Jiang Ayao and the crew were awakened and cried for help, nearby small boats rushed to the rescue. They rescued six or seven crew members from the Lutan boat and salvaged over a hundred bags of rice before the boat sank to the bottom of the water. The sunken sailboat drifted with the tide to the riverbed in front of the Jiangdong branch of the Bank of Communications. It had previously bumped into the "Jingsheng" wheel and broke one of its iron chains. The sunken rice, besides the hundred or so bags salvaged by the small boatmen, was also salvaged by the Chinese Salvage Company hired to salvage the Jingsheng wheel.

### US Citizens Form "War Damage Claims Group"; US Authorities' Attitude is Temporarily Unwilling to Take Action; Group Takes Further Steps

Due to the significant property losses suffered by American citizens as a result of the Sino-Japanese War, a group of US citizens has begun negotiations with the Japanese military and is seeking to organize a "War Damage Claims Group" to obtain an accurate figure for future negotiations. The group will investigate the actual extent of the damages and demand compensation from the Japanese side. The US Consulate in this city is unwilling to take action on this matter. To further its work, the group has scheduled a second meeting today to announce the number of committee members, which is reportedly set at thirty to forty people.

### Gao Xinbao's Murder Being Investigated; Bullet Trajectory Being Studied; Gao Was an Ardent Supporter of the Government and Refused to Participate in "Bandit Territory" Activities

The "Continental Daily News" reports that Gao Xinbao, the owner of a dance hall, was shot and killed by thugs on Yuqiaqing Road on the night of the 15th of this month. The Public Concession Police Department is investigating, but there are still no leads. According to the autopsy yesterday (the 16th), Gao's body had three bullet wounds. A firearms expert from the Police Department is studying the bullets that killed Gao to determine if the murder weapon is registered with the Police Department. The results of the study will be known on the 18th. According to Gao's friends, his refusal to participate in "bandit territory" activities was the motive for his murder. Up until last week, people from the bandit territory were still asking Gao for financial assistance. Gao firmly refused, threatening them with the severest punishment. It is reported that Gao usually ardently supported the Chinese government. In the early autumn, he was accused by the Japanese of being involved in guerrilla activities in the Shanghai area, resulting in his detention by the Police Department, but he was soon released.

### Funeral Held Yesterday

Gao Huaide, President of the Lido Sports Association, passed away from injuries sustained on the evening of the 15th in front of the Yipinxiang Inn on Yuqiaqing Road. Details were reported previously. Gao's remains were sent to the Central Funeral Home that evening. On the day before yesterday, the First Special District Local Court sent officials to inspect the body, and yesterday the funeral was held. Gao had a wide circle of friends during his lifetime, so mourners filled Mabai Road yesterday. The funeral arrangements were elaborate and solemn. Details are as follows:

White Carriages and Horses

Those who came to pay their respects yesterday were all friends, relatives, and students of Gao. Notable figures such as Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Ludeng, Madam Du, Xu Shihao, Yang Shunquan, Bian Ruixin, Zhang Jiguang, Guo Baoshu, Wang Yaotang, Li Zugu, Zhu Rushan, Gan Jingxian, Wu Linkun, Chen Qiwei, Kui Yanfang, Sheng Zecheng, Ding Fubao, Zhang Shankun, Jiang Yiping, Jin Tingsun, Zhong Kecheng, Wu Deru, Cai Futang, Gu Cuixiang, and others all personally came to pay their respects, totaling over a thousand people. Several of his closest old friends wept loudly over the coffin, and their cries, along with those of his family, shook heaven and earth.

Heartbreaking Scene

Gao left behind six orphans and also had grandchildren. His eldest son, Shangde, graduated from St. John's University, while the youngest is still in diapers. His mother is still alive, over seventy years old, and in frail health. Therefore, the tragic incident was kept secret from her until yesterday afternoon. The old woman's love for her son was profound. Seeing the tragic scene in the mourning hall, she wept bitterly, which was heartbreaking. Although Gao was not wealthy, thousands of people depended on him for their livelihood. The International Relief Association presented a plaque that read "The Star of the Community Has Fallen," and the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association's plaque read "Benefiting the Refugees," which were not exaggerations.

Bullets Unrecoverable

When Gao was shot, the thugs fired a total of four shots. The first bullet hit his waist, a vital point. The second bullet hit the No. 11311 car. The last two bullets hit his head and left leg. The three bullets that hit his body were unrecoverable. There were only entry wounds on the body, indicating that they were still inside. However, a thorough search yielded nothing. The court examined the body on the day before yesterday, searching with X-rays and performing surgery, but nothing was found. Therefore, firearms experts from the police are currently examining Gao's car and the bullet that hit the car body to study whether it was a chemical reaction or whether it was fired from a gun that is already recorded by the police. The results will be known soon.

Gao's Brief Biography

Gao was a native of Shanghai, 46 years old (the ages listed in various newspapers are incorrect). He was a generous and upright person, with the spirit of Mencius, had a wide circle of friends, kept his promises, and was particularly fond of giving. During the January 28th Incident, he organized a wounded soldier's hospital, which was a great success. During the August 13th Incident, he again used his Lido as a medical facility for wounded soldiers. At that time, refugees were everywhere, and he generously donated money without hesitation. He contributed significantly to charitable causes. Recently, he founded the Lido Sports Association and was engaged in commerce. Unfortunately, just as the scale was being established, he suddenly met with misfortune, which is deeply mourned.

### Shanghai Westside Gambling Dens Decline; Gambling Dens Close Down; Rongsheng Gambling Den Already Sold

The gambling dens in Shanghai's westside are now declining. The neon lights and eye-catching posters that used to adorn the entrances of every gambling den are no longer lit or posted. The disputes over gambling taxes have made it difficult for the gambling dens, and with the signing of the Road Extension Agreement, the special police are about to be established, and the gambling dens will be forced to close. The previously bustling gamblers are now few in number, and business has slumped. It is reported that the owners of the gambling dens are now seeking other avenues. For example, Shao Liangeng, the owner of the Rongsheng gambling den on Yanping Road, has recently sold all of his assets and is planning to change his business. Other gambling dens, such as Fusheng and Guangsheng, have already been closed for many days. Zhao Lan, Hollywood, Broadway, Qiuyuan, and other gambling dens are also preparing to close. However, all the gambling den owners have become rich overnight. (Another report) Shao Liangeng, a Wuxi native who owns one of the largest gambling dens in Shanghai's westside, the "Rongsheng Club," has made huge profits since its founding. It is reported that Shao does not intend to continue operating the club and recently, a week ago, sold all of the assets of Rongsheng to a Macau gambler for 550,000 yuan. 250,000 yuan has already been paid, and the remaining 300,000 yuan will be paid after the official transfer. It is also reported that after completing the formalities, Shao plans to go to Hong Kong.

### Collision on Huangpu River; Bodies Recovered

Regarding the case of the Nisshin Shipping Company's (formerly Toa Shipping) new port liner, Taiko Maru, colliding with and sinking the puppet "Water Patrol Team Shanghai No. 10 Ferry" at Lujiazui, Huangpu River, while leaving the port at around 11:00 PM on the 15th, details were published in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that in addition to the seven Chinese and Japanese victims mentioned yesterday, Huang Junhou, a puppet "Social Bureau Secretary," also died in the river, bringing the total number of drowned to eight. Yesterday, the Japanese military police, the puppet "Water Patrol Team," and the families of the deceased hired boats to search the river. All of the bodies of the Japanese military police have been recovered by the Japanese military police. Also recovered were the bodies of Zhuang Jinlong (31 years old, local), the coxswain of the Water Patrol Team ferry, Wang Ajin (16 years old, local), a deckhand, Zhang Shunjin (52 years old, local), and Huang Junhou (22 years old, Tianjin, married just two weeks ago), the puppet "Social Bureau Secretary." Yesterday, the four Chinese bodies were lying in a makeshift thatched shed at the Hongsheng Wharf in Pudong. Zhao Afa (27 years old, Nanjing), the captain, and a female puppet "police officer" (a woman with a pockmarked face who had recently been promoted to "patrol leader" and had gone to Hongkou that day to thank the person who recommended her for the promotion) were still missing as of last night. The captain of the Taiko Maru, who caused the accident, is Japanese, not Chinese, and is currently detained in the Japanese Maritime Military Police Station at the Beijing Road Wharf. His future fate is unknown.

According to foreign sources, the Japanese side issued a report today regarding the incident in which the Japanese Taiko Maru collided with and sank a ferry in the Huangpu River the night before yesterday. According to the report, at 0:10 AM yesterday (the 16th), Japanese military police Sergeant Kuroki Shigeo, accompanied by Yamazaki and seven Chinese, were traveling on the puppet "Shanghai Municipal Government" Ferry No. 10 to Pudong. About 600 meters from the Pudong wharf, the Taiko Maru, sailing between Shanghai and the new port, passed by at high speed. The small vessel could not avoid the ship and a collision occurred. The Japanese military police sergeant was a skilled swimmer and survived, but one Japanese is still missing.

### The Most Advanced Treatment for Nocturnal Emission - Helping Those Harmed by Masturbation

— Dr. Yang Daonan, Graduate of Medical Science from a Russian Labor University

Most young people who masturbate are tempted by their environment. Prolonged nocturnal emission leads to various debilitating ailments.

Although nocturnal emission is not solely caused by masturbation, a considerable number of people suffer severe harm due to masturbation. In the eyes of us doctors, the reason why young people tend to masturbate is mostly due to environmental temptation. Furthermore, young people who enjoy reading obscene books and looking at lewd pictures are generally unreliable. Secondly, they are compelled by physiological factors. Those who have reached a certain age but still have a foreskin are easily induced to masturbate by the stimulation of secretions accumulated in the foreskin. Masturbation arouses sexual excitement, leading to a rise in lustful desires, clouded minds, and inevitably, nocturnal emission and insomnia.

Regarding the harm of masturbation, people with some general medical knowledge know that it is the root cause of weakened brain nerves and sexual function. Why is this so? Because masturbation relies solely on unnatural fantasy, concentrating all attention on one point, causing erotic fantasies to arise in the brain. Therefore, it easily fatigues the brain nerves, resulting in damage to the brain, causing symptoms such as dizziness, brain swelling, tinnitus, and forgetfulness. At the same time, the erection and ejaculation functions are also disrupted by masturbation, losing their normal state. Hence, sometimes even a slight impulse during the day can lead to spermatorrhea. Overall health deteriorates, complexion becomes pale, development is incomplete, and symptoms such as kidney deficiency, premature ejaculation, impotence, and infertility are almost entirely formed by this incurable affliction. Without active treatment, there is no guarantee of life, which is extremely dangerous.

Based on my years of experience in treating this type of disease, the German testicular essence preparation "Vigophos" for men is most effective in treating masturbation-induced injuries, neurasthenia, incomplete development, brain weakness, and kidney deficiency. However, in cases of frequent nocturnal emission, "Naldes Nocturnal Emission Pills" should be used first to stop the emission. In short, those with this type of disease should take both medications together. During the day, take two tablets of "Vigophos" three times a day. Before bed, take three tablets of "Naldes Nocturnal Emission Pills." Then, any severe nocturnal emission, spermatorrhea, neurasthenia, incomplete development, kidney deficiency, impotence, and other symptoms will be cured. "Vigophos" is divided into male and female versions, with the female version being an ovarian endocrine preparation with the function of regulating menstruation and promoting conception.

### The Key to Treating Lung Disease

— Dr. Sheng Zaiqiang

The lungs are an unconscious organ, so when they are invaded by tuberculosis bacteria, there is no awareness. Even if erosion forms cavities, there is no specific pain. Only when tuberculosis bacteria attack the pleura, causing pleurisy, is there a sensation of stabbing pain in the chest. Or, pleurisy may lead to fluid accumulation in the chest cavity, or tuberculous meningitis may lead to death. Therefore, in treating lung disease, one should pay attention to nourishment, such as good air circulation and sufficient sunlight. Regarding diet, one should especially consume nutritious and easily digestible foods. One should also avoid stimulants such as tobacco and alcohol. The main aspect is to use the special lung disease medication, "Pulmotone", to increase calcium in the lungs and kill tuberculosis bacteria. Therefore, lung disease, no matter what stage, can be completely cured. Thus, it is no coincidence that "Pulmotone" is popular in various countries.

Venereal Disease Chronicles

### The Great Purge of Gonococcal Poison

— Dr. Huang Zhongchang, American Medical Doctor

Because of its extremely strong contagiousness, gonorrhea spreads very quickly. In society, regardless of the poor or rich, there are gonorrhea patients mixed among us. This point alone is enough to see the great harm gonorrhea inflicts on humanity. The history of gonorrhea is not a recent phenomenon, but has a long history alongside humanity, so its harm to humanity is very great. And in the end, there has been no way to conquer it. Speaking of the causative bacteria of gonorrhea, its viability is worth mentioning first. The gonococcus is a bacterium that reproduces extremely quickly. Its shape is like two spheres stacked together, hence the name diplococcus. Generally, what harms our patients is not the gonococcus itself, but the toxins produced by the gonococcus, which infiltrate the mucous membrane, causing inflammation and swelling, resulting in concrete gonorrhea. Furthermore, because the gonococcus spreads to various places, it causes various lesions in those places. This is the origin of gonococcal complications. To eradicate gonorrhea, killing the bacteria is of course necessary, but purging the toxins of the gonococcus is also not to be ignored.

To achieve such a fundamental solution to the problem of gonorrhea, the use of bactericidal, anti-gonococcal, and detoxifying gonococcal therapy is essential. To achieve this goal, it is also essential to adopt the latest gonorrhea-specific drug that has been invented. Based on my experience, the latest gonorrhea-specific drug "Neo-Clinon" invented by Dr. Peter of Germany is highly effective. This agent is made using the finest ingredients of the latest chemical therapy, removing reactive impurities, and made by scientific methods. After taking it, it can automatically generate an anti-gonococcal and detoxifying effect in gonorrhea patients and has analgesic effects. Therefore, "Neo-Clinon" can cure all cases of acute gonorrhea at the onset, inflammation of the anterior urethra, inflammation spreading to the posterior urethra, and posterior urethritis, as well as cases where the infection spreads to the genitals, urinary organs, and blood, causing prostatitis, orchitis, and cystitis.

### Cases of Curing Kidney Deficiency, Physical Weakness, and Incomplete Development

— Dr. Zheng Da, German Medical Doctor

Patient Xie Zhimin, 34 years old, from Pukou, Jiangsu Province, (self-described): In recent years, I have made many mistakes in my work, my thoughts are bad, I have profuse night sweats, insomnia, and headaches. I feel deeply distressed. (Disease history) - As a child, I was tempted by classmates to masturbate in the dormitory, but I stopped after a while. Later, after marriage, I overindulged in sexual activity for about three years. My body became more and more tired. My genitals are small, and my relationship with my wife is weak. Although I have been married for three years, I still have no children. I beg for treatment. (Treatment process) - First, I prescribed the German seminal emission medicine "Naldes Nocturnal Emission Pills" to stop the emission, and gave him electrotherapy for fifteen minutes every day. At the same time, I administered the "Vigophos" endocrine supplement three times a day to replenish his deficiency. In this way, with both internal and external care, after one month, the seminal emission had completely stopped. His appetite also increased, his spirits were uplifted, his complexion became rosy, and he slept soundly at night. He could have stopped taking the medication, but because Mr. Xie wanted to fully restore the development of his genitals, he continued to take "Vigophos" internally. After half a year, his erections were firm and his genitals lengthened. Recently, he sent a letter saying so.

### The Causes and Consequences of Urethral Gonorrhea

— Written by Dr. Yao Juyan

Clinic: Ningbo Road

Intersection of Sichuan Road, No. 9

Once infected with gonorrhea, the initial gonococci mostly parasitize in the anterior urethra. At this time, if the gonococci are swept away with lightning speed, the gonococci that have not yet gained a foothold will have no way to struggle and will be wiped out in one fell swoop. However, if this kind of bacteria is not vigorously eliminated at this time, all kinds of changes will arise from this. In general, the gonococci of the anterior urethra are commonly seen in the prodromal stage of gonorrhea. When it goes from the prodromal stage to the acute stage, the gonococci are no longer confined to the anterior urethra and have entered the posterior urethra, and all kinds of complications are increasing, and treatment is more difficult than in the prodromal stage. The reason why gonorrhea caused by gonococci in the anterior urethra is easy to eradicate is that the anterior urethra has no complex structure physiologically. Therefore, treatment is very easy. If the gonococci have invaded the posterior urethra, although treatment is more difficult, if the gonococci have not yet invaded the urinary system, internal reproductive system, or blood circulation system, the root cause is still not very difficult to eradicate. But if it has become gonococcal cystitis, prostatitis, orchitis, arthritis, etc., it is tantamount to indicating that the patient's gonorrhea has invaded these systems. The treatment is not only more difficult than anterior urethritis, but also more difficult than posterior urethritis. All of the above are the causes and consequences of untreated gonococcal urethritis. And the only treatment is to take the gonorrhea-specific chemotherapeutic drug "Neo-Clinon" (available at both Taihe and Wing On Companies) to have any hope of eradication. Because the range of gonococci that have spread from the anterior urethra to the three major systems is wide, it is absolutely impossible to complete the task of expelling the gonococci with a piece-by-piece local operation. I also use German static electricity therapy to help the bactericidal power of "Neo-Clinon" to be fully exerted. Clinic hours: 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM. From today, 20 patients will be seen daily. Each number will only cost five dimes and will include a free copy of the "Complete Book of Sexually Transmitted Diseases" worth one dollar.

### Real Zuo Bi - Fortune Telling and Sutra Explaining, Third Session - Ancient and Modern Marriage Divination

"Zuo Zhuan" records in the early part of the 22nd year of Duke Zhuang that Yi Shi divined about marrying his daughter to Jing Zhong. The divination was auspicious, saying, "It is like a phoenix flying together, their harmonious calls are clear and loud." "Zhen Zuo Bi notes" Ancient marriage divination was decided by divination. Today's matchmaking always involves analyzing the stems and branches of both parties, forming eight characters. First, one discusses whether there is mutual generation or conflict. Then, one determines the wife's husband star, descendants, longevity, food and clothing, virtue, frugality, as well as her fortune... Using this, one can determine the fate of their lifelong marriage. If the results match, I do not boast of being a seasoned matchmaker. However, I am meticulous and spare no effort in divination and selecting auspicious dates for marriage. (To be continued)

Economic Supplement

### The Core of Soaring Prices in Shanghai and Countermeasures

— Tao Gongwen

Everyone feels the constant pressure of rising prices in daily life. In February of this year, the living expenses of workers in Shanghai increased by an average of almost three times compared to the same month last year. The extent of price increases is thus imaginable.

Shanghai Worker Living Expenses Index Table

The soaring prices in Shanghai directly oppress the city's common people. However, when a portion of essential goods from the interior still rely on Shanghai for supply, the people of the interior inevitably suffer from the indirect oppression of Shanghai's soaring prices. Therefore, the sharp rise in prices in this city, while not giving our national policy a serious blow, will at least have a considerable adverse impact. Therefore, not only the common people and local authorities in Shanghai deeply hope that prices will tend towards a reasonable level and that necessary measures should be taken, but also our highest authorities are unlikely to be unconcerned about the rising prices in Shanghai.

To stabilize prices in Shanghai, we must first investigate the reasons for their sharp rise. Regarding the reasons for the sharp rise in prices, opinions vary depending on individual viewpoints, and proposals also differ. Summarizing, there seem to be three main arguments:

(1) The legal tender (fabi) has already experienced excessive inflation, resulting in a drastic drop in purchasing power;

(2) Due to the special environment of Shanghai, the quantity of goods imported into Shanghai has drastically decreased;

(3) Rampant speculation has led to a sharp increase in the demand for goods.

Let's first examine whether the legal tender has indeed experienced excessive inflation. According to a telegram from Chongqing on January 17, the amount of legal tender issued by the four major banks (Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Communications Bank, and Farmers Bank of China) was 3,081,787,295 yuan, an increase of one-fold compared to the issuance of 1,511,714,642 yuan when the "August 13th" war broke out. However, from a national perspective, the actual circulation of our legal tender has not increased as much as the amount issued due to the following reasons:

(1) A portion of the increased legal tender is used to replace the provincial currency and silver coins that have been withdrawn;

(2) In reality, a portion of the legal tender has been destroyed by artillery fire or has been lost and will no longer circulate in the market;

(3) Because banks retain more deposit reserves during times of emergency than in peacetime; the legal tender used for these deposit reserves will definitely not flow into society unless a bank run occurs;

(4) The lending policies of banks are now more cautious than usual, so the opportunity for lending is relatively reduced. Of the deposits received, in addition to retaining a portion as deposit reserves, a portion still cannot be lent out and remains idle in the vaults;

(5) Bank depositors, having learned the lesson of two restrictions on withdrawals, fear that the government will impose a third restriction. They would rather take some risks and keep more cash on hand, so the amount of legal tender locked away in people's safes or wallets has also increased compared to normal times.

The amount issued is not the same as the amount in circulation. Due to the above reasons, it can be seen that the amount issued has not been excessively inflated. In addition, inconvenient transportation in various regions, scarce trade, and the abnormal state of financial regulatory institutions in various regions further preclude any discussion of expansion in its speed of circulation or volume of circulation. However, this is from a national perspective; the situation in this city is relatively different. Because in addition to legal tender, there are other currencies, such as checks, drafts, and remittance instruments. More importantly, funds from the occupied areas and Hong Kong are gradually concentrating in Shanghai, without any reasonable investment, allowing them to float in the market. Therefore, in terms of circulation, it seems to have expanded considerably compared to before, which seems undeniable. But this is not the most important reason. If it maintains a balanced relationship with the supply and demand of goods, in other words: if its circulation speed can indeed maintain a balanced relationship with the normal volume of commercial transactions, then the increase in the amount of currency is a phenomenon that should exist in a prosperous market. In this case, we should examine the supply and demand relationship of goods in Shanghai. After Guangzhou, Shantou, Xiamen, and other places fell one after another, there was indeed a panic about the supply of goods in Shanghai. Now, attracted by the high prices in Shanghai, the quantity of goods supplied to Shanghai from the occupied areas and the interior may have actually increased considerably compared to before. In terms of transportation conditions, there have been no drastic changes in China's coastal transportation, and international transportation has even become somewhat smoother due to the relaxation of naval warfare. Goods from the United Kingdom, the United States, and other countries are still flowing in steadily. The problem is that all goods coming from the occupied areas must first be subject to the control of a certain party. This control is undoubtedly one of the direct causes of the increase in the price of goods.

Shanghai was originally China's largest speculative market. Especially today, when the state's ruling power has temporarily lost its position in Shanghai, the speculative atmosphere is becoming increasingly prosperous. After the outbreak of the European War, the gold that had fled from China to Hong Kong returned to Shanghai along with the concentration of funds from the occupied areas. According to a report in this newspaper on the 8th, the floating capital in Shanghai is at least 300 billion yuan, of which 50% is in current deposits in various banks, 10% is invested in emerging businesses in western Shanghai, and the remaining 40% is excess capital flowing into speculation. Moreover, at least half of the current deposits held by various banks can also flow into speculation. The main targets of speculation are (1) hoarding daily necessities, such as rice, flour, coal, and cloth, (2) buying and selling foreign exchange and foreign currency, (3) buying and selling gold, (4) buying and selling stocks and bonds, (5) engaging in remittance discounts and arbitrage. Due to the rampant speculative atmosphere, the demand for goods has shown an irrational surge. Although a large amount of foreign rice is imported, the price of rice still maintains an upward trend. The coal reserves are still ample, but the price of coal is still rising. This clearly proves that speculators are at work, causing the supply and demand of goods to lose balance.

In summary, the core of the recent soaring prices in Shanghai is the considerable expansion of the currency supply in this city, the monopolization of the source of goods, and the prevalence of various types of speculation. But for the price stabilization policies that can be implemented at present, perhaps we can only shrink the amount of currency in this city, manage the capital activities in this city, and crack down on speculative behavior to balance the supply and demand of goods.

Shrinking the amount of currency in Shanghai is indeed not an easy task. In the current situation, Shanghai is still a "comfortable haven" for capital, and floating capital from all sides is flowing into Shanghai like a tide. To reduce the amount of floating capital in Shanghai, it is necessary to establish better investment places than Shanghai, and then the floating capital of this port will flow there. Then, where should better investment places be established? Needless to say, it is of course the southwest and northwest of our country. The highest authorities have long formulated preferential measures for people to invest in construction projects in the interior, giving the funds invested in the interior a solid guarantee and preferential interest rates. However, the floating capital in Shanghai still remains in Shanghai. Therefore, to reduce the amount of speculation by Shanghai's floating capital, we must look to the banking industry to manage its capital utilization on its own. Such as raising loan interest rates, restricting collateral lending, etc.

Speaking of cracking down on speculative behavior, in the current special environment, it is feared that it will be difficult to achieve results solely through government orders and local authority announcements. It is also necessary to rely on the cooperation of trade associations and the banking industry. The retribution that speculators deserve will surely come upon them sooner or later. However, while they are still thoroughly enlightened by the lessons of facts and are still immersed in speculative behavior, members of the same industry should mutually restrain speculation by people within the industry and speculation by people outside the industry engaged in the industry. When lending money, the banking industry should not only consider the creditworthiness of the borrower, but also investigate the use of the funds. If you are worried that the funds cannot be lent out, I think it is better to reduce deposit interest rates, or the banking industry should promote credit cooperation for the living expenses of ordinary people. The best thing is to automatically find ways to invest in the interior. As for trade associations, they are now starting to crack down on speculative behavior. The organized briquette industry trade association, the flour mill trade association; the banking industry has also raised lending interest rates to prevent speculation by borrowing money for hoarding. We hope that other trade associations will also unite to stop speculation and take more effective and stricter preventive measures than those currently taken by the above two trade associations. At the same time, we place great hopes on the price stabilization plans and determination of the authorities of the two concessions.

Price of Goods in Chongqing

According to a survey by the Southwest Economic Research Institute: Since the war, the price of goods in Chongqing has risen sharply. The increase in food prices is shown in the following table:

### Soaring Prices and the Problem of Balancing Prices

— Liu Zhizhi

What are the general causes of prices in various parts of China at present? To summarize, I am afraid it will not go beyond the following points:

(1) The establishment of the black market for foreign exchange. The activity of the black market has led to a decline in foreign exchange, prompting an increase in the price of imported goods, which indirectly raised the prices of some domestic goods.

(2) Reduced production. The expansion of the war zone has naturally affected production and reduced it. Even those who can still work are limited by environmental factors and cannot produce in large quantities.

(3) Imbalance of supply and demand. Today, China's industry and commerce, on the one hand, cannot carry out large-scale manufacturing and mass production to supply the society, and on the other hand, the people's enjoyment of material life has not been reduced due to frugality. In this way, it is impossible to say that the two aspects of supply and demand are balanced, and in this situation of demand exceeding supply, how can prices not increase?

(4) Transportation difficulties and increased taxes and risks along the way. The inconvenience of transportation has made prices lose their regulatory balance. This has always been a major and serious problem in China. Moreover, today, many important industrial and commercial areas have successively become war zones due to the aggressor's control and various difficulties. Therefore, there are many obstacles and thorns in transportation regulation, and when you want to transport goods from Place A to Place B, the unpredictable risks encountered along the way are even greater. In this way, after enduring the utmost danger, the price of industrial and commercial products will be greatly increased.

(5) Controlled and lacking sources. Regarding this aspect, it is indeed one of the important reasons for the current soaring prices in general, and it is also the most worthy of people's attention. Because in China's already occupied areas, there are many production areas for industrial and commercial raw materials, but today, after being occupied by the other side, they will definitely do their best to plunder, and even monopolize all of them. In this way, the source of goods will naturally be scarce, and how can prices not be expensive? As proof, the situation of the soaring prices in the Shanghai soybean oil market before the summer vacation last year, the prices of rice and grain in Shanghai after the new grain in various parts of the country entered the market, not only did not decrease, but instead continued to rise day by day. All of these are because soybeans and rice were specially noticed by the Japanese, and all of them were completely prohibited from being transported to Shanghai.

(6) Merchants hoarding and speculating, deliberately manipulating. Regarding this point, it is indeed one of the reasons for the current increase in prices in various places. Especially in Shanghai, where China's political power cannot reach today, the situation is even more terrible.

(7) The relationship of the population concentrated in one corner. The concentration of the population in one corner, causing prices to soar, is a major example in Shanghai.

(8) The instability of market psychology. As for the reasons why market psychology is unstable, it is also entirely due to a small number of powerful industrialists and businessmen spreading many unfounded rumors that deliberately dazzle the public's ears and eyes, hoping to take advantage of this to manipulate the market in order to satisfy their personal insatiable desires.

In addition, the increased costs of production of goods in other aspects, such as the acceptance of goods as collateral for loans by some banking industries, are all related to the soaring prices of all goods today.

Various Plans to Stabilize Prices

The result of the domestic prices continuing to increase without restriction will inevitably affect the weakening of national purchasing power. If this rising trend is allowed to continue unabated without seeking ways to curb it, it will directly and indirectly cause serious panic in the lives of the people and will also promote social disorder and the inability to maintain law and order.

However, although the Chinese government has long been determined to control wartime prices, it is ultimately limited by the environment. Because, in terms of price control policies, many European and American industrialized countries have implemented them and achieved results. However, my country is an agricultural country, and is different from foreign countries in terms of politics, economy, and other aspects. Moreover, due to the lack of accurate and detailed statistics, it is naturally inconvenient to cite the methods used by foreign countries. Moreover, even if we imitate and implement them, I am afraid that we may not see so much success. Then, the several implementation measures that can be adopted for the problem of balancing prices at the present time are natural prices and cracking down on speculative manipulation methods, and ordering local organizations to form price stabilization committees to bear the burden of setting prices for the necessities of life for the people. Moreover, in the price stabilization measures promulgated by the government this time, there are also three standards worth citing by our people, namely: (1) For items whose production and sales costs have not been affected by the war or have been slightly affected, the average price of the three or one year before the war shall prevail. (2) For items whose production and sales costs have been affected by the war, the standard shall be the cost after the war plus the appropriate profit. (3) For items whose costs are not easy to calculate, the standard shall be the total amount of capital invested in their business, plus a considerable profit, and it is stipulated that the items for balancing prices are limited to daily necessities.

The organization of the price stabilization committee is jointly organized by local governments, provincial banks, local banks, and local chambers of commerce and trade associations. Its responsibility is to assess the selling prices of daily necessities for the people, and it also stipulates three items of regulations that violate this standard. Anyone who violates these three items of regulations may file a complaint with the court.

However, in Shanghai, because of the special environment, of course, in addition to complying with the laws and regulations promulgated by the government, we must also work hard to exhaust the following points. In this way, there will be hope for the future dawn of the problem of balancing prices.

(1) The authorities of the two concessions should jointly establish a strong price stabilization committee with the city's public organizations, trade associations, and influential people in society to conduct mutual discussions and come up with the most effective price control plan.

(2) For several types of goods in terms of daily necessities, such as rice, flour, briquettes, etc., the trade associations should be ordered and instructed to instruct each member firm not to engage in illegal and irregular transactions, so as to avoid suspicion of manipulation and hoarding. Those who do not comply with the order shall be referred to the general meeting for disciplinary action, and shall be subject to the highest severe punishment or fine by the court.

(3) For those items that originally had regulatory associations, their internal organization should be strengthened and their responsibilities and powers should be exercised externally.

(4) I sincerely hope that the members of the banking industry can transfer huge amounts of funds, pay them in advance, and jointly with various public organizations in the society, order huge amounts of daily necessities from abroad to expand and sustain the scope and time of price stabilization, so as to further benefit the masses.

(5) I sincerely hope that all newspapers and organs that speak for the people will do their best to supervise public opinion and seek to expose all kinds of conspiracies and the truth within, so that every profiteer will know that there is a need to be careful and cautious.

(6) All citizens should work together in harmony, labor and management should conspire, unite and cooperate, and remain calm in the face of the coming great changes. In this way, we will avoid being saddened by our loved ones and pleased by our enemies.

In addition, on the other hand, for balancing prices, I hope that all sectors can establish a public price and control consumption for all kinds of goods in terms of the people's daily necessities, and must force the people to comply. In addition, we should also pay attention to the large-scale increase in production and communication in transportation work. Moreover, we should inform the people that everyone can automatically get up to save consumption and cherish goods, in order to adjust the supply and demand of goods in equilibrium and prevent prices from rising again.

### Sino-Japanese Trade in Hardware

— Wang Yizhi

Hardware is a major raw material for military industrial industries; however, Japan relies solely on overseas imports for the supply of this raw material, and most of it comes from the United States. Now that the United States and Japan are in an era of no business, the raw material problem of Japan's military industrial industries is particularly noteworthy.

According to the US announcement, the percentage of important raw materials recently supplied by the US to Japan for combat needs is shown in the table below. From the previous table, it can be seen that Japan's economic and even combat capabilities are deeply dependent on the United States. Let us further describe the situation of Sino-Japanese trade in hardware. However, since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the Japanese government has kept secret the import figures of important goods such as various raw materials and materials related to the military industrial industry. Therefore, the actual situation can only be imagined from the pre-war state.

From the table below, it can be seen that at that time, Japan's hardware raw materials did not seem to be entirely supplied by the United States. However, after the outbreak of the European War, all of its original suppliers had to switch to supplying their own use, or were purchased nearby by the European belligerents. Therefore, Japan has no other source except the United States. Commercial News

### Foodstuffs: Rice Prices Plummet More and More Fiercely; Yesterday, Prices in All Markets Plunged by One or Two Yuan; Business Closed Every Week Starting April 10

The rice market has been declining since this month and has been depreciating day by day. Although there have been several rebounds in the middle, it has always been high and then low, nothing more than a large drop and a small rebound. Taking the highest peak of 52 yuan for the current Geng Hongpan No. 1 Saigon as an example, it has fallen below the closing price of 43 yuan at the end of last year. One after another, the slump has reached as much as 10 yuan. Such a tired phenomenon is indeed unprecedented in the rice market. In short, things will turn when they reach their extreme, and prosperity will decline when they reach their peak. This is the constant principle of heaven. When the price of rice soared unexpectedly, the reaction was also fierce, beyond the ordinary. However, according to the current rice market, in terms of pricing, it seems to be low. After its over-selling, there may be some wandering and rebound. However, things went against expectations. Not only was there no hope of standing firm, but it fell more and more sharply. Yesterday, trading throughout the city felt even more deserted. General guests all saw their hands shrink back. In the morning, there was no inquiry at all. It was not until nearly 10:30 in the morning that the floating tenement householders were eager to sell and threw it off again, suddenly falling by one yuan before there was any action. However, it was still not smooth. Moreover, the original root guest vendors also sold each other lightly because of the congestion of arrivals and the heavier silver roots, resulting in no improvement in the rear sales market and frequent price declines. If No. 1 Saigon initially opened at 41 yuan and 50 cents, it was only sold at 40 yuan and 8 cents here. The fire twist initially sold for 40 yuan and 5 cents, and later sold for 40 yuan to 39 yuan and a half. Fortunately, after this "throw", there were some wholesale transactions, and retail sales were also more. Therefore, it was able to stand a little until the market closed. However, the closing price plummeted by another one and a half to nearly two yuan compared to before. All other goods were similar. The closing price of Xiaowen was 37 yuan to 36 yuan and a half, No. 2 Saigon was 37 yuan and a half to 37 yuan, No. 2 Siam was 37 yuan, crushed tip was 33 yuan to 30 yuan, and the glutinous rice market fell by one fall at this time, also cutting the yuan Xu. Thick and thin japonica and other national rice outside the market, the secret price did not fall by about one yuan.

Attached news, the matter of the rice market closing on Sundays has been resolved by the association yesterday. The announcement will be approved starting from the first Sunday of April 7, and thereafter, business will be closed for one day every Sunday.

### The Woolen Industry After the Shanghai War

— Maofang

(1) Introduction

The Shanghai woolen industry has undergone great changes since the "August 13th" Incident. I would like to compile it as follows. When the "August 13th Shanghai War" began, the Shanghai woolen industry all suspended business. It was not until September 1 that business resumed (the Western clothing gang market was earlier). In early October, business officially resumed. At that time, it was still the initial stage of the War of Resistance, and people's hearts were inevitably quite turbulent, not as stable as it is now because the War of Resistance has lasted longer.

(2) Losses of the Shanghai Woolen Industry During the War of Resistance

At the beginning of the "August 13th" Shanghai War, most of the woolen industry was greatly panicked, especially in the Hongkou district. Although many people had moved away a few days earlier, the goods could not be taken out in full, so except for a very small number, none of them suffered great losses. At the end of the twenty-sixth year, in addition to a large decrease in turnover, the accounts could not be settled as scheduled. The accounts receivable in the local and foreign ports were all in a bad state. Other woolen weaving factories, because most of the factory sites were in the Chinese concession and the Hongkou district, several of them also suffered considerable losses.

(3) Deformed Woolen Fabrics

However, in March of the twenty-seventh year, the market situation suddenly changed greatly, and the prices of goods all rose sharply. The main reasons were (1) the government implemented foreign exchange control, resulting in a sharp increase in costs, (2) the lack of arrivals, and because the population of the isolated island increased sharply, the demand was strong, resulting in the woolen industry also becoming a situation of demand exceeding supply under deformed development, and the market continued to rise. Among them, domestic woolen fabrics were even more popular and salable.

(4) The Rise of Speculation Inside and Outside the Industry

Since Shanghai became an isolated island and the population increased, various businesses have developed in a deformed way. Therefore, woolen fabrics have also attracted the attention of hoarding households, who have invested in speculation and absorbed and bought them at all costs. Even more people use methods to manipulate the market and reap huge profits. Because the situation in Shanghai is special, the transportation and sales of woolen fabrics are still the hub. Other things, such as the entry and exit of goods being uniformly paid in cash, the sudden increase in small local machine households, and the transportation of goods mostly taking the route of Hong Kong, Haifang, Wenzhou, and Jinhua, as well as transportation to inland ports, and strict inspections to prevent inferior goods from being mixed in, are all events that occurred after the war.

### Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek's Hopes for the National Education Conference: Implement the Plan with Courage and Vigor

(Chongqing, 16th) Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek has four hopes for the National Education Conference: (1) Implement the National Education Plan with courage and vigor. Existing funds and assets should be thoroughly reorganized. Local donations should also be planned according to the circumstances and location. When starting, a firm determination should be established, and a commitment to action should be demonstrated. Once the plan is finalized, it can be implemented gradually and maximize benefits. (2) It is hoped that local gentry and scholars will be motivated to work together to support this initiative. In each province and county, humbly consult with respected individuals to inform them of the steps of implementing national education, the importance of the relationship with the local area, and the central government's determination to achieve this goal. This will encourage them to spread the word or take the lead themselves, creating mutual inspiration and a widespread response. (3) It is hoped that emphasis will be placed on teacher training and practical on-site supervision, raising the self-esteem and sense of responsibility of educators, making them see education as a sacred cause. They should also be willing to travel to various counties or send personnel for regular supervision, which can both provide guidance on implementation methods and help solve local difficulties. (4) Competitive methods should be used judiciously, and the assessment of the effectiveness of national education implementation should be strictly enforced. This is the responsibility of education officials at all levels, as well as administrative officials at all levels. Therefore, assessment standards must be established, practical on-site inspections must be strictly enforced, universality should be sought in establishment, and quality must be ensured in substance. Eliminate the accumulated habit of false reporting and the malpractice of nominal existence without substance. Without fostering assessments, there is no way to uncover deception and urge improvement. If a method of competition between counties and districts can be used judiciously and publicized regularly to provide encouragement, then mutual learning will occur, and the effect will be significant.

### West League First Division Football: Tung Wah Loses Again to West Fords; Two-Nil, Second Half Record

In yesterday's West League First Division football match, Tung Wah played against West Fords at Jiaozhou Park. Although Jia Youliang played with an injury, they still lost by two goals to nil. The goals were recorded in the second half.

Two Goals Conceded

Wan Jin arrived late, Tung Wah kicked off and attacked. Bing Hao dribbled the ball straight to the front, but failed to score. The Scottish team seized the opportunity to counter-attack. Fraser shot from the middle, Zhang Zhaopeng rescued the danger. Thomson kicked a corner kick, which was well-placed. Bi Gao jumped up to parry the ball. Wan Jin arrived and joined the battle. The forwards were slightly more active, but the wind hindered them, and they did not succeed for a long time. Soon after, the defender Han Wenkai kicked the ball from the goal, hitting Lin Dianhua's arm. Fortunately, Dianhua was outside the penalty area, and a free kick was awarded. Duncan kicked the ball, missing the goal by two feet. The Tung Wah forwards did not fit in, and in the rear defense, the enemy galloped horizontally, creating dangerous situations.

At 31 minutes, the Scottish team's right winger Ross kicked a corner kick. Bi Gao jumped up to rescue, but his eyes were dazzled by the sunlight and he failed to catch the ball. Fraser waited for the ball and gently pushed it in, one-nil. Tung Wah conceded the first goal and tried to retaliate. Gao Baozheng hooked the ball from the baseline, but Lu Fang and Wan Jin both lost their footing. Speirs kicked the ball into a corner kick, which was taken by Lu Fang, but the ball went wide. The Scottish team seized the opportunity to attack. At 40 minutes, Ross made a comeback and shot from 40 yards, hitting the goalpost and bouncing into the net, two-nil, ending the first half.

No Score in Second Half

Changing sides and playing again, Tung Wah put all its effort into counter-attacking and gained the advantage of the wind, and the attack became much better. Wan Jin dribbled the ball into the goal from not far from the goal, but it was disallowed for a foul. The fans in the stands sighed. The Tung Wah players did not slacken their efforts because of this, and the attack became even more rampant. Bing Hao once knocked on the door, but was parried by the goalkeeper Algenson with one hand. Wan Jin shot twice, but both were caught. Losing several opportunities in a row was due to bad luck, not a lack of fighting spirit. Until the end of the game, neither side scored, and the Scottish team won by two goals to nil.

Therefore, the battle tonight may not necessarily be a defeat. He Cheng will also do its best to compete. This game is undoubtedly one of the most exciting games in silver and banking basketball. In order to prevent crowding, the association requires members of the Lianyi Association to enter the venue with their membership cards.

### Encouraging the Planting of Sweet Potatoes

In Fujian Province, there are more mountains than fields, and half of the people's food depends on sweet potatoes. Their seeds came from overseas ships, and it is said that they first appeared in the Ming Dynasty. Barren fields, gaps in the land, and areas on hillsides that can be plowed are all suitable for planting. It is estimated that one day's effort can provide half a month's food. There are the most in Fujian, Guangdong, and other places, and some people in Zhejiang also plant them. Ruzhou, Lushan, Songxian, and other counties have already introduced the planting. They have also been seen in the markets of Bian, but they are not as large. If the planting method can be obtained, they will naturally thrive. According to the nature of the scholars in Henan, they are mostly carefree, and planting sweet potatoes is most suitable. Sweet potatoes are also called sweet potatoes, and people in Henan call them sweet potatoes. Fujian and Guangdong have always had this variety. They are round, several inches long, with red skin and white flesh. In recent years, new varieties have been introduced from overseas ships from the Kingdom of Brunei. They are round, with white skin and yellow flesh. Both have milky vines that grow and their roots grow into potatoes underground. They are moist and sweet, non-toxic, replenish the middle and benefit the qi, strengthen the spleen and tonify yin, and have the same effect as potatoes, which is sufficient to serve as food. In the warm lands of the south, the potato heads or old vines are put into the ground in the first month of the year, and they are vigorously watered to make the branches and nodes grow easily, and the vines can be divided and planted during the spring equinox. Henan Province should plant the seeds after the thaw, when it is warm, and watch the seedlings grow large before dividing and planting. In the south, there is a late potato planting in May and June, and all will benefit from it. Early potatoes are gradually dug up after May and June, and all are taken and stored before the frost falls. Potatoes are suitable for high ground, and fertile land does not require fertilizer. For those who choose large areas of garden land and dry land, use large manure to fertilize them before the year. Or if the soil is not sandy, mix it with firewood ash, cow dung, and horse manure to loosen the soil. For consumption, it can be fried, steamed, stewed, boiled, sliced, dried, and boiled. It can also be eaten raw. It can be ground into fine grains and used to make cakes and other things. Steaming and mixing it with noodles to make wine is also fragrant and delicious. One acre of land can yield seventy to eighty dan (a unit of dry measure), which can keep a family of several mouths from starving.

### Lessons from the "Travel" in the Tragic Jingchanghong Steamer Incident

— Zhang Mengzhao

Without climbing high mountains, you wouldn't know how good it is to walk on flat ground! Without embarking on a journey, how would you know the suffering of wading and crossing the sea? Therefore, as the saying goes, "A mile away from home is not as good as being at home!" However, a man's ambition lies in all directions, so how can he stick to his home and sit in a well, looking at the sky?

This time, the sinking tragedy of the Jingsheng small steamer in Ningbo Port, with more than two hundred people killed, and the sound of wailing was endless, was truly a terrible event in travel. The cause of this tragedy was due to the fact that the person in charge of the steamer did not pay enough attention to limiting the load, and the passengers' panic to board the ship and their lack of order, as well as their lack of alert wisdom to avoid the catastrophe, were also regrettable.

Only "a certain gentleman who escaped death" was very "alert" and good at "adapting." Reading his report, one can know that, according to him: "... On the 2nd (i.e., the 2nd of this month) in the afternoon, I went to the dock to wait for the steamer. At that time, the passengers were already extremely crowded. After the Jingsheng steamer docked, I used all my strength to squeeze into the ship. About half an hour later, I suddenly heard a loud alarm. I saw a Japanese plane passing overhead. Fearing an accident, the ship quickly untied the cable and set sail. The ship gradually left the shore. There were still many passengers who did not have time to board the steamer, so they hired sampans to ferry them to the Jingsheng small steamer. The boatmen used bamboo poles with iron hooks at one end to hook the Jingsheng ship, allowing passengers to climb onto the ship. At that time, the ship was small and there were many people, and the ship was hooked by the boatmen, causing the ship to tilt. The lower cabin gradually flooded... Seeing that the situation was not good, I quickly abandoned my luggage and jumped into another sampan, ordering it to row quickly to the shore... Looking back at the ship from the shore, I only saw a chimney on the water..." and so on.

The author of this report is named "Survivor," which is truly fitting. However, his "quick-wittedness" and "adaptive action" of landing ashore are admirable.

From this Jingsheng steamer tragedy, the lessons learned from "travel" are to be alert, not to rush, not to panic, and to rather let others go first than to hurry. Haste will lead to confusion, and when a sudden change occurs, there will be no time to take action. Like "Survivor" Mr. Someone, being able to see that the situation was not good and quickly abandon his luggage to jump into another sampan, is the reason why he was able to remain calm in the face of danger, adapt to the situation, and be reborn. Therefore, like "taking the world as one's home," the traveler must be careful and alert. Careful and alert are not only conditions that should be possessed on the journey, but also conditions that are endlessly useful in other things in life.

### Yang Caoxian's Old Cloth Single Clothes

— Sun Choucheng

Mr. Yang Caoxian, an old man of Bai Er, who is good at calligraphy, is over a hundred years old, but he is still hale and hearty. The clothes he wears are mainly loose and comfortable, without seeking beauty; the inner clothes are designed to avoid sweating, adhering to the two sayings of the national doctor, "Sweating cures diseases, sweating causes diseases." Once he sweats, he immediately changes his clothes, so that the sweaty clothes do not stick to his body and invade the pores and blood vessels. The outer clothes are designed to keep out the cold, adhering to the "cloth clothes keep warm" three-character secret. The style is not fashionable, and the material is not fond of silk and satin. No matter spring, summer, autumn, or winter, he must wear an old cloth single coat outside. The waist and cuffs are unusually large, almost like the Dharma clothes worn by Taoists, which has become a habit. Yesterday, at the spring banquet at the Jinmen Hotel in the China Women's Building, he wore this old cloth single coat, running around and receiving guests, very busy. People asked him about the main purpose of wearing cloth clothes. He said that good or bad clothes have nothing to do with me. Although Shanghai only values clothes and not people, I have nothing to ask of people. I sell my calligraphy to support myself. I go my own way. It is still comfortable to wear old cloth single clothes. Now that everything is soaring in price, making a good piece of clothing would cost three or five years of living expenses for a refugee. It is not worth it. It not only loses the lives of others, but also wants to lose my own life. The income from selling my calligraphy has always been used for three purposes: (1) Relieving refugees, (2) Repaying, and (3) To be content with food and clothing, it is already difficult, so how dare I ask for beautiful clothes and pursue the fashion of one person? After the people present studied what he said, they came up with the following comments and prepared to write a horizontal plaque to present to him as a souvenir, roughly saying that cloth clothes are proud of princes and nobles, and are independent of the world. It is called noble, but it is not pretentious, but eccentric. Judging from the principle of common survival of mankind, it does not seem to be appropriate. Great men also advocate frugal and virtuous old cloth single clothes. A group of misers and hoarders are not included in this example and must be clearly distinguished. Poor and humble people wear old cloth clothes because they are forced by the environment. He wrote a word abroad and received 20,000 yuan, which can be called turning stone into gold, as rich as princes and nobles, but he is also so frugal, which is indeed commendable. Today, entertaining guests here is to implement the second item of the three purposes. I hope that he will continue to follow the past methods for the first item, then there is no need to persuade him to make clothes, but to be able to implement his proposition for the third item.

### Idle Talk About Rubber Tires

Rubber tires, such as those for rickshaws and rickshaws, are one of the auxiliary supplies for transportation. More than ten years ago, those used in the market were completely imported. According to the Jianghai Customs report more than ten years ago, the annual import was about 40 to 50 million yuan, and the leakage was so large that it was shocking. Later, the Ye Zhenming Enpu brothers gathered Zhu Liangfu and other enthusiastic comrades in the industry to establish the Datong Industrial Company to manufacture Sanyuan brand tires for sale to the world. This was the beginning of domestic tires. Subsequently, Dahua Yisheng and others were produced at the right time, but their main business was rubber shoes, etc. Tires were only one of the subsidiary products, which was slightly different from Datong. The raw materials of tires are glue, zinc spring powder, magnesium carbonate, litharge, sulfur, black ink, accelerators, lithopone, canvas, etc. (I will not list them all). Generally speaking, whether a tire is strong and durable, it is necessary to choose good canvas, which is the only necessary condition. Secondly, the mixing of rubber powder and the average pressure should also be noted. Mr. Ye and others have worked hard to research, and after several setbacks, they finally did not lose heart. At present, they have achieved the goal of domestic capital, domestic materials, and domestic manufacturing. As a result, all imported products in the market have disappeared, reducing the number of imports every year. In the midst of advocating domestic products, efforts to produce is to increase the power of resistance, which is indeed an exciting thing.

Currently, there are about 10,000 rickshaws and about 300,000 bicycles in Shanghai. According to a private survey, 60% of them have adopted Sanyuan brand tires. Since the National Government moved west, the highways in the southwest and northwest have advanced by leaps and bounds, and the demand for transportation tools has been very high. The supply of auxiliary products should be exhausted and domestic products should be used. Even the islands of Southeast Asia have inquired about the situation of domestic tires from China, which can reflect that the Chinese people have been awakened in the midst of national difficulties, and everyone is willing to fulfill the natural duty of using domestic products.

### Lofty Necessities of Life in the League of Nations: Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation

— Tianyan Zhilang

The "League of Nations," judging by its name, is a political group that transcends the governments of various nations. The council convenes four times a year. Geneva, a famous Swiss city known for its tranquility and elegance, suddenly shines brightly on this auspicious day, transforming into a heavily made-up Xi Shi. I will not inquire into the powers and abilities of the council members, nor do I have time to calculate the airplane and first-class car travel and entertainment before and after the meetings. If I were to simply describe the luxurious lifestyle of the council members during the four large and small meetings, it would truly be worthy of being called the unique Supreme Immortal Abode in the world. Regardless of whether a country is wealthy or poor, and regardless of the size of its population, the life of these "lucky star" reincarnated council members is not only something that very few people in the world can experience, but perhaps even fewer people in the world know about in detail. Today, I will unveil the mystery and write a poem about each aspect, to offer to my compatriots who are afraid of spending money and hesitate to step forward. Perhaps it will be like using a painting of a cake to satisfy hunger, bringing temporary spiritual comfort.

First, Ode to Clothing: Pristine white like the Zhongtiao Mountains. The cut is loose, wide on the outside. The sash hangs loosely, as desired. May peace prevail, celebrating promotion. Note: The "League of Nations" is a place where typical diplomatic officials gather, and England is a place that produces typical tailors. Clothing must cross the sea to be obtained from England, demonstrating its beauty. After the European war, many people in Russia wore rags, but the chief representative attending Geneva still wore a completely new set of high-quality attire, changed several times a day. Fortunately, it was a business trip with public expenses, so he did not have to pay out of his own pocket. When diplomatic officials attend formal dinners or evening parties, they naturally change into tailcoats to enhance their dignified appearance. Even if there are storms in the world, they will never reach Geneva. Although Abyssinia is in ashes and Spain is engulfed in flames, the diplomatic officials of those countries, due to their service in the League of Nations, are rewarded for their service. The position of chief representative is valuable, and the frequency with which the chief representative changes clothes is even more valuable. The white collar, white shirt, and white scarf, which are in the "middle" and "straight," are valued for their "white" color, free from any speck of dust. The enjoyment of loosening the sash and leisurely wearing new clothes, and enjoying oneself to the fullest during morning and evening rest, is the ultimate secret for contemporary diplomatic officials to achieve "clear minds" and "lofty sentiments." Confucius only achieved doing as he pleased at the age of seventy, how late it was!

Second, Ode to Food: Fine wine flows like a spring at the immortals' gathering. Rare delicacies are served, entertaining honored guests. Only now do I understand the weight of the plate. Exhaling fragrant breath, all things are renewed in spring.

Note: Geneva is a miniature Paris, with fine wines and delicacies that are treasured throughout the world. The specialties of the major restaurants along the Quai du Mont-Blanc are so numerous and beautiful in color, aroma, and taste that it would take ten years of study to fully explain the origins of their names. Diplomatic terminology is simple, but culinary terminology is very difficult. Even the erudite Gu Hongming was ridiculed by a Western waiter for not recognizing the menu (as reported in the Shen Bao on October 30 of last year). It is easy to eat, but difficult to know. I will now take the menu for a light lunch at the Hotel Beau-Rivage and translate it. Compared to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and his wife eating turkey in Hankou on Christmas 1937, it seems to be several times more enjoyable. The exquisite delicacies and small victories are too numerous to count. "Those who are not insiders cannot fully appreciate their subtleties," resembling the mountain god entertaining the Five Dragons and serving the hundred spirits. After the second main course, these "five large" and "many small" council members, full of "national meals," if there are several people present, will always give short, witty speeches that are neither too serious nor too trivial. As soon as the eloquent speech, perfumed with wine and meat, ends, applause follows. Regardless of the eight festivals or four seasons, there is always the joy of a spring day in the pot. Beautiful is Geneva, deeply understanding the principles of modern diplomacy and preserving peace. A sample lunch menu is listed below.

Third, Ode to Housing: The flowing waves brush against the railing, as clear as the sea. Tall trees pierce the clouds, evoking the sound of autumn. The joy of peace is worth ten thousand gold coins per moment. Red leaves adorn the pavilion, proudly displaying their late-season glory. Note: Swiss travel is well-prepared, always inspiring sighs of admiration, but this is not easily understood by short-term visitors. As for the extravagance of the League of Nations' expenses, if we combine the membership fees of various countries and the expenses of the chief representatives, the cost of an hour of meeting may exceed ten thousand Chinese dollars.

Fourth, Ode to Transportation: Counting the clouds like rafts on the clear lake. The autumn wind calls to the sea as one family. Slowly, the clear shade moves with the star-adorned banners. The sun sets beyond the White Mountain Bridge. Note: The White Mountain Bridge is lined with mansions on both sides, and at noon, the carriages are numerous. The carriages with small national flags of bright colors in front are reserved for the chief representatives. The distance across the bridge cannot be traveled on foot. The dignity is solemn and refreshing, reminiscent of ancient officials.

### A Week of Economical Menus

— Ms. Huamei

Cauliflower seems to be a vegetable for the nobility, because it often has a place in banquets of all sizes, and it is also often used in Western food. However, recently the price of cauliflower is not very expensive, and you can buy a small one for ten cents. Because the price is not expensive, I want to invite it to participate in this economical menu. For meat dishes, it is very delicious whether it is stir-fried with shrimp or stir-fried with kidney. However, shrimp and kidney are too expensive, so it is more economical to stir-fry it with pork slices or pork cubes, and you can skip the soy sauce. If you add more soup, it can be eaten with rice, which is very simple and elegant. As for vegetarian dishes, you can add vegetarian ten-scenery. If you fry it with bamboo shoots and mushrooms, it can also occupy a seat at a vegetarian banquet.

Spring and Autumn

### Riding the Same Boat

Editor: Recently, the news about the strike at the ×× Third Cotton Mill is a truly dangerous omen on this isolated island, especially with the recent increase in labor unrest. The crux of the problem, of course, is the impact of rising prices and hoarding. The workers here, suffering from the heavy exploitation of unscrupulous merchants, are not trying to disrupt order, but rather to uphold it, and are therefore making a reasonable request. They are finding it difficult to even support the most basic of necessities—a bowl of congee and a meal. How can workers work after expending their labor and sweat if they don't add fuel (food)?

However, the bosses are too cruel. They once said to the workers: "Unless you starve to death, there are more than a thousand sacks here, ready to throw you all into the river together." Such people are truly selfish and self-serving.

Starting that day (the 11th), the factory re-registered workers, which, in other words, meant dismissing them en masse. Imagine what will happen to these completely dismissed people. If they take desperate measures, wouldn't that exacerbate social unrest? Therefore, I respectfully appeal to all sectors to uphold justice and to urge the capitalists to handle this matter openly and fairly. I believe that at this time and in this place, everyone must cooperate sincerely. Only when national workers have food to eat can they work.

Wishing you well, Spring and Autumn reader Chen Jingsi (no reply needed)

### The Buying and Selling of US Dollar Notes

— Zhang Zhenshan

I saw advertisements in the newspaper for buying and selling US dollar notes, saying that you only need to pay a little deposit to trade at any time. Today, with the price of US dollar notes rising to 15.5 yuan, it's amazing that such a business has emerged. It really feels like there are too many and too easy opportunities to make money in Shanghai.

Although I know that the reality is not that simple, and I have no intention of making a fortune in US dollar notes, since this type of business is still new in Shanghai, to understand what is really going on, I pretended to be a customer who was determined to buy US dollar notes. I obtained a copy of the regulations and read it once, twice, three times. There were still some parts that were vaguely worded and not very clear. After inquiring in person, the so-called "low commissions and interest rates"... were finally understood.

For example: If you prepare to buy 100 US dollar notes, you only need to pay a deposit of 200 yuan. At the current market price of 15.5 yuan, it would cost 1,550 yuan to buy them, but now you only need to pay 200 yuan. On the surface, it seems very cheap, but in reality? It's not that simple. In addition to the 200 yuan deposit, there is also a commission of one percent and an interest rate of one and a half percent. The calculation method is as follows: Assuming you buy 100 US dollar notes, the equivalent in legal tender, after deducting the 200 yuan deposit, is equal to an overdraft of 1,350 yuan. For this 1,350 yuan, you must pay an interest rate of one and a half percent per yuan, plus a commission of one percent, totaling 33.75 yuan. In reality, it is equivalent to a loan rate of two and a half percent to buy US dollar notes. At the end of the month, if the exchange rate between US dollar notes and legal tender does not change, then your monthly expenditure of 33.75 yuan will be like "a mute eating Coptis chinensis, unable to express the bitterness." Even if the exchange rate rises favorably, it must rise by at least 0.34 yuan per dollar to break even. Based on past experience, although the price of US dollar notes has risen a lot, it has not risen suddenly; it has risen gradually. If you wait month after month, perhaps one day your ideal rise will be realized, but after offsetting the monthly interest expenses, it is not "you" who is making money, but "them." As for the exchange rate of US dollar notes falling? Then they have your deposit as collateral, and when the loss reaches 50%, the disposal rights of these US dollar notes belong to them.

We have a saying that "the eyes are black and the silver is white." The reason why those speculators manipulate the market is to satisfy their desire for "silver." However, if ordinary people abandon legitimate business and want to gamble for unjust wealth, then they will fall into our saying "digging loaches from a cat's mouth," which is extremely difficult! Moreover, the foundation of their speculative business is built on such a fragile opportunity!

### The Buying and Selling of Diplomas

— (Lun)

I have a classmate who was in the second year of high school last semester. After the winter vacation, he suddenly entered university and became a university student! But he is a student at a private university.

As far as I know: Private universities do not enroll new students without "sufficient education". You must have a high school diploma to be admitted. So when I saw that classmate had entered university, I found it very strange. After inquiring, I learned that he had spent over 100 yuan to buy a diploma from an agency. This kind of leapfrog education does not have good results for students, which goes without saying. However, what is strange is that there are actually schools that "sell diplomas."

Schools are places where students receive education, not places to manufacture "qualifications," and certainly not places to sell "qualifications." Now, there are schools that boldly sell diplomas, so these schools can simply be turned into shops, shops that sell diplomas. Perhaps this is because there are no direct educational institutions to manage them on the isolated island, so those school principals are "blinded by greed" and "do whatever they want." Finally, I hope that the education authorities will know about these diploma-selling schools and give them severe sanctions!

### After the Rain, a Clear Sky

— Bao Tianxiao

Chapter 21: Managing the Economy, Mixing Fibers, Promoting Machinery, Assisting the Written Word

Wu Junsu asked, "Why must the newspaper printed by that machine be transported to that province? Is it possible that the newspapers printed by each machine are different, so they must be separated by boundaries?" Shao Huihua said, "Not so. This is just for ease of transportation. After the newspaper is printed by the machine, it is directly transported to the packaging room on the upper floor. For example, the newspaper printed by the machine in Zhejiang Province is sent to the packaging room on the upper floor, and this packaging room is dedicated to packing newspapers going to Zhejiang. After packing, the label is attached, and it is immediately sent to the truck by pulley. This truck is parked at the door of the packaging room, and as soon as it is loaded, it is immediately sent to the Shanghai-Zhejiang road. How convenient this is! Otherwise, the order would be chaotic. The newspaper of Zhejiang Province is like this, and so is the newspaper of other provinces. But we also have to distinguish between train newspapers and plane newspapers. Because the trucks transporting the newspapers are all regulated. The trucks carrying train newspapers go directly to the train station. The trucks carrying plane newspapers go directly to the airport. So our newspaper trucks, like the machines, are all clearly marked." Tian Junsu said, "I see. Then you must have many trucks delivering newspapers in the morning?" Shao Huihua said, "Not many! We now have 30 special trucks for transporting newspapers. But recently we still feel it is not enough, so we have ordered ten new ones. The old ones can be replaced and used for other purposes!" Wu Junsu said, "Then what about the newspapers in this city? Of course, they don't need to go to the packaging room." Shao Huihua said, "Ah! The most newspapers are in this city. Look at that long row of machines; they are all printing the city's newspapers. Although they don't need to be packed, they are also transported to the upper floor, which is a distribution room. People who read newspapers want to be the first to see them, so as soon as the newspaper leaves the machine, it must be sent to people to read immediately." Ku Junsu said, "It's a pity that you distribute the newspapers at dawn; otherwise, I would come and see. Those people who deliver newspapers every day must be very crowded in front of your newspaper office." Shao Huihua said, "Not crowded! If all the newspaper deliverers in Shanghai had to come to the newspaper office every day to pick up the newspapers, it would naturally be very crowded. But now the distribution department has set up many distribution stations. Just like our newspaper office, there are twelve distribution stations in Shanghai. As soon as the newspaper is published, it is transported to various distribution stations by truck. Such as the west district in the west district, the east district in the east district, the south city in the south city, the north city in the north city, and the city's newspaper delivery network each have their own region. Newspaper deliverers all go to various distribution stations to wait. If you want to see, go to that distribution station to see. Rows of bicycles are all numbered, and when they depart, it is quite a sight." (251)
