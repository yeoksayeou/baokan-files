(5) These methods will be implemented from the date of approval. (Dispatch of the 23rd)

### Ministry of Finance Issues Circular: To Suppress Excessive Interest Rates

Chongqing: The Ministry of Finance has received reports that some areas are lending out currency capital and receiving grain interest, with the interest exceeding the statutory rate. In order to reduce the burden on farmers, a special circular has been issued to the provincial governments, strictly suppressing the practice. The original instructions are recorded as follows: It is hereby stated that the interest on loans, whether paid in cash or converted to rent grain, should uniformly comply with the interest rate set by the National Government, with an annual interest rate not exceeding 2%. In this extraordinary period, lending and interest collection should take into account social economics. In recent years, the government has been vigorously promoting agricultural loans and expanding the scope of agricultural loans in order to reduce the burden on farmers and revitalize the rural economy. It has recently been heard that some areas are still lending out currency capital and receiving grain interest, with the interest exceeding the statutory rate by more than double, or even the principal being less than the interest. If such excessive interest rates are not strictly investigated and prohibited, the agricultural economy and people's livelihoods will be greatly affected. In addition to distributing copies, it is hereby ordered that your provincial government comply, instruct all counties to publicize widely, and that hereafter, all those who receive grain interest in the form of currency should use the grain price at the time of the agreement as the standard, and the interest rate should not exceed 20% to limit the practice and comply with the law. This order. (Dispatch of the 22nd)

### American Citizen Arrested in Hanoi: Has Already Been Released

Washington: The State Department stated yesterday that the government is currently collecting further evidence to clarify the truth about the arrest of American Vice Consul Linden and United Press correspondent Jacoby in Hanoi. Officials stated that they had only heard of the news from newspapers and would not comment until official information was received. It is reported that Mr. Linden was formerly stationed in Hong Kong. It is also said that Jacoby was arrested by a Japanese sentry guarding an ammunition depot. It is also learned that the two Americans had driven their car close to the ammunition depot, and Jacoby had taken a photograph there. It is said that when the two were interfered with by the sentry, they immediately drove away, but were intercepted at a railway crossing, as French gendarmes patrolled the area. At that time, the Japanese sentry handed Jacoby and Linden over to the French authorities. Whether the two have been detained or not is currently unknown. (United Press dispatch of the 23rd)

Hong Kong: News received here today stated that American consulate official Linden and United Press reporter Japi were arrested on Thursday for taking photos of Japanese-occupied buildings in Hanoi, resulting in half an hour of detention. However, after the French authorities intervened, the Japanese released the two. The building where Mr. Jia was taking pictures belonged to the American United Business Company. Although the building was occupied by the Japanese army, the American flag on the roof had not been removed, hence the misunderstanding. It is said that the company was originally owned by Chinese, but since the Japanese army entered Vietnam, the company has been transferred to American ownership. (United Press dispatch of the 23rd)

Editorial

### Hitler's New Challenge

Two weeks ago, this newspaper, commenting on the Greek war situation, asserted that after a prolonged war, the British Air Force and fleet would pose an imminent threat to the Italian mainland and its islands. Indeed, on the night of the 11th of this month, British aircraft bombed Taranto harbor on a large scale. Afterwards, according to official reports from the British Admiralty and Mussolini's own speeches, three of Italy's only six new and old battleships were damaged. This newspaper also asserted that the Blackshirt army's blitzkrieg against Greece would encounter initial setbacks. Indeed, Mussolini's use of force against Greece has not only failed to achieve anything, but has even suffered enormous losses in both spiritual and material terms. This is another tangible failure of the Axis powers since the establishment of the Tripartite Pact on September 27, after the United States and Britain strengthened their Far East policies and Japan was at a loss.

Hitler, the "protagonist" of the German-Italian-Japanese axis, witnessing the failure of his two "supporting actors", had no choice but to quickly come up with other methods, hoping to quickly achieve something in both military and diplomatic terms in order to reverse this decline. As a result, the German-orchestrated diplomatic offensive has been unusually active in the past two weeks. Undoubtedly, this is a preliminary preparation or a preliminary probe under this challenge. Analyzing its offensive, it includes: (1) Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's visit to Germany on the 12th of this month to return the courtesy. Although the significance of this trip caused a sensation at the time, both Germany and the Soviet Union seemed to be tight-lipped about the specific results of the Berlin talks afterwards. What Moscow announced to the world, on the contrary, was a series of acknowledgments, acknowledging the establishment of an agreement with Japan, acknowledging coveting India, and even acknowledging Hungary's accession to the Tripartite Pact. (2) Spanish Foreign Minister Suñer arrived in Germany on the 18th of this month and held a meeting with the foreign ministers of Germany and Italy in Salzburg, but the result did not lead to Spain's accession to the Axis as expected by the outside world. Instead, Suñer quietly returned home on the 19th without waiting for the so-called Vienna Conference to be held. (3) On the 20th of this month, Hungarian Prime Minister Teleki and Foreign Minister Csáky signed a protocol in Vienna with representatives of Germany, Italy, and Japan, formally joining the Tripartite Pact. This is the latest achievement of Hitler's diplomatic offensive, but it is well known that Hungary has long been under the wing of Germany and Italy. Her dependence on Germany has very little impact on the Anglo-German and Anglo-Italian war, and even less on Japan's war against China. As for joining the Pact, it is only a formality and has no new significance whatsoever. (4) Following the Hungarian dignitaries, those who have arrived in Berlin at this time include the new dictator and prime minister of Romania, Antonescu, and those who have announced that they will arrive soon include the prime minister of Bulgaria, Popov, and the prime minister of the Slovakian state, Tuka. Among them, Romania has already followed in Hungary's footsteps and signed the Tripartite Pact, which is not surprising given that German troops have already filled Romanian territory. Slovakia is equivalent to a German protectorate and does not need to be taken seriously. What is more noteworthy is Bulgaria, because just when Italy's attack on Greece was unsuccessful and rumors of German aid were rampant, Bulgarian public opinion advocated demanding a passage to the sea from Greece. In addition, rumors that the Bulgarian king allowed German troops to pass through Bulgaria to attack Greece during his visit to Hitler a few days ago have made people pay attention to the movements of the Sofia government.

Originally, the most pressing problem facing Hitler at this time, apart from the war directly against the British mainland, was this "Greek quagmire". Hitler's heart may already be feeling an indescribable bitterness, and he may be regretting not having allowed Italy to attack Greece, which backfired. Not only did it fail to restrain Britain, but it also ended up trapping itself. This failure, on the one hand, confirms that Mussolini made the same mistake as Japan, underestimating the strength of the opponent. On the other hand, it further exposes Germany's and Italy's eagerness to win and their impatience to wage a long-term war with Britain, so they are eager to "find another way", fantasizing about finding the weak points of the British Empire in the eastern Mediterranean. It is speculated that the initial intention of the German and Italian authorities may have been to defeat Greece in one fell swoop, and then further threaten the Near East, support North Africa, and gradually eliminate British influence in the eastern Mediterranean. At that time, Spain, seeing the decline of the British Mediterranean Fleet, may finally listen to the incitement of Germany and Italy and begin operations against Gibraltar. The Soviet Union, seeing the increasing encroachment of Axis forces, may even temporarily change its reserved attitude and take preemptive action in the Near East or even the Middle East, gaining some bases for self-defense. If these ideals can really be realized, wouldn't British influence be driven out of the Mediterranean? Wouldn't the British Empire have to disintegrate in the end? Unfortunately, these many wishful thinking have gradually become bubbles with the repeated defeats of the Blackshirt army, leading to the situation today where Hitler not only failed to receive the benefits of expanding the war, but suffered a great loss and urgently needs to find a remedy. The most urgent and effective action is of course to directly send troops to assist in the attack on Greece, so he must first completely place several small countries in the Balkan Peninsula under his control. According to the above, Romania and Hungary are almost not a problem. The remaining two countries are Bulgaria and Yugoslavia, because they are both necessary routes for German troops to enter Greece, so the problem is more complicated. Among them, Bulgaria is adjacent to Turkey on one side and to Bessarabia, which was recently merged by the Soviet Union, on the other. Whether Turkey and the Soviet Union are willing to sit idly by while German troops pass through Bulgaria to the south is a very big question. If Moscow and Ankara cannot agree, Hitler is really forced to look to Yugoslavia. However, after the recent bombing of the border city of Bitola in Yugoslavia by Italian aircraft, the attitude of the Belgrade government has not been weak. If Yugoslavia is encouraged by the Greek resistance and refuses to give in easily, whether Germany and Italy are prepared to use force against Yugoslavia at the same time is also a difficult question worth studying.

In short, from a third-party standpoint, if Italy cannot slightly recover the prestige lost in the defeat at Korçë before the German troops come to assist, then Hitler's diplomatic offensive, no matter how hard it tries, will probably be difficult to "captivate people", not to mention that parallel to the German diplomatic offensive, there is also British activity and the appeal of Greece!

### China Does Not Value So-Called Peace Talks; Jointly Battles with Democratic Nations; Soviet Union Will Not Stop Aiding China by Stationing Troops on Border; Japan-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact Still Difficult to Materialize

Washington - American newspapers yesterday mentioned the fifth anniversary of the aerial contact between China and the United States. Five years ago yesterday, the China Clipper made an epoch-making flight. During these five years, the Clipper carried a total of 7,000 passengers and over 13 million letters, crossing the world's largest ocean to China and various places along the way. However, American newspapers are paying even greater attention to recent news from China. According to this news, even if Japan proposes glorious peace terms, China will reject them. This news contains the gist that China will fight alongside democratic nations against the Axis powers. The general public is very satisfied with this. The New York Times editorial, titled "Japan's China Enigma," stated that the fog of rice paddies and the smoke of gunfire are intertwined, making the future situation in the Far East unclear. The rumor that Japan will propose new peace proposals to China is spreading more and more. If Japan decides to resolve the "China Incident," it will carry out its current actions, namely, withdrawing troops. However, the Japanese withdrawal may only be a preparation to advance south to Saigon and Thailand, and to spy on Singapore and the Dutch East Indies along the rich highways. In order to give China face and make it accept its peace proposals, it is also necessary for Japan to withdraw troops. If the Japanese side can persuade Chairman Chiang to accept, it can enable Japan to both retain a part of its gains in China and escape to advance south. The Tokyo side will be very happy. However, China seems determined not to make this mistake. (Reuters, 23rd)

Hong Kong - The rumor that Japan and the Soviet Union have almost agreed to conclude a non-aggression pact has been circulating for a long time. However, people here believe that the pact is still difficult to materialize. It is known here that Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Tatekawa, is now making every effort to make the Soviet Union and Japan conclude a general agreement. What Japan wants is not just a non-aggression pact. It is said that the meaning of this is that Japan wants the Soviet Union to stop all aid to China and resolve the dispute over the concession rights for coal and fishing in Sakhalin Island. According to news from the Japanese side, Moscow is willing to conclude a non-aggression pact with Japan at any time, but is unwilling to discuss the issue of aid to China, as well as the issue of concession rights for coal and fishing in Sakhalin Island and Kamchatka. The dispute over coal and fishing rights has been stalled for more than a year, and the two sides have not concluded any agreement. According to news from Yan'an, the Soviet Union has guaranteed that it will continue to aid China. Therefore, the Soviet Union avoids any agreement to stop aiding China. The Soviet Union secretly told some Chinese in Chongqing and Yan'an that even if Japan and the Soviet Union conclude a non-aggression pact, it will only be a decision on the Soviet-Manchurian border. The Soviet army will still concentrate on the border, so that the Japanese army in Guangdong cannot invade the Chinese mainland or participate in the southward advance. News from Yan'an continued that Stalin's current dealings with Japan are the same as his sending secret signals to Germany, Britain, the United States, and other countries. China and Britain were once quite afraid that a Soviet-Japanese non-aggression pact would allow the Japanese army in Guangdong to end the "China Incident" without restraint, or invade British territories in the Far East. Observers here believe that the Soviet Union may be willing to reopen negotiations on coal and fishing rights with Japan in exchange for signing a non-aggression pact. The pact may increase Japan's courage. According to news here, if the Soviet Union does not sign a non-aggression pact and does not agree not to attack Japan from the rear, the navy may not advance south. The Soviet Union is very willing to sign this pact, but it does not mean that it will remove any threats. What Moscow wants is to maintain neutrality. Observers finally stated that Ambassador Tatekawa must overcome great difficulties in order to obtain the Soviet Union's firm support to resolve the "China Incident" or implement the southward advance.

### USS Augusta Sails to San Francisco; To Be Assigned to Hawaiian Fleet

Manila - The flagship of the US Navy's Asiatic Fleet, the USS Augusta, sailed from Manila this morning after six years of stationing in the Far East, heading for San Francisco, where it will be repainted and then assigned to the US Battle Fleet stationed in Hawaii.

The flag of Admiral Hart, Commander-in-Chief of the Asiatic Fleet, was changed to be hoisted on the Houston. The ship is well known in the Far East because it was previously the flagship of the Asiatic Fleet until it was replaced by the Augusta in 1934. (Reuters, 23rd)

### Red Star Newspaper Reviews International Situation; Tension in the Pacific; Japan Seeks Quick Victory

Moscow - The Red Star newspaper recently published a special article reviewing the international situation, stating that the Grand Political Council of Japan had a major internal conflict when drafting the election law reform bill. There are currently two reform proposals that have not yet been finalized. In terms of foreign affairs, the biggest issues are still the Sino-Japanese War and the southward advance. Judging from the rhetoric of Japanese newspapers, it can be seen that the ruling class of Japan advocates resolving the war against China as soon as possible, so that Japan can freely realize its new plans drawn up due to the European war. Regarding the situation in Vietnam and rumors of a military alliance between Britain, the United States, and Thailand, the newspaper commented that Japan recently dispatched warships to Vietnam, which must be closely related, indicating that the situation in the southwest Pacific is extremely tense.

He denied that the United States has any imperialist goals and cited Uruguay's refusal to exchange Pottawatomi's naval and air base for US loans as proof. He said that Spain, incited by the Axis powers, is interfering with Washington's attempt to establish a Pan-American defense group. The US State Department is very angry about this. Welles declared, "I must reiterate that our government has never discussed with the governments of other American republics the transfer of naval bases by purchase or lease, nor has it ever made any suggestions that would infringe upon the sovereignty of other American republics." He praised Argentine President's remarks that foreign dangers require the cooperation of Pan-American defense. (International News Agency, 23rd)

### Spanish Falange Party Active in Mexico

Capital of Mexico - It is reported that the Spanish Falange Party is very active in Mexico, which has caused concern among the labor community and Spanish refugees. This activity may be the first step in the Spanish restoration movement, or it may start with economic and cultural aggression. It is reported that this activity has intensified since Suner became Foreign Minister. The Mexican President ordered the dissolution of the Falange Party within the country in 1939, but newspapers still pointed out that the party is secretly becoming more active. The Labor Party's People's Daily pointed out that the party is trying to infiltrate various Mexican organizations, aiming to manipulate labor unions and cultural groups. The Falangists are also manipulating a group called "National Youth Labor Federation". There are many Spanish Republican refugees who have come to Mexico for asylum, all of whom are welcomed and assisted by the Mexican government. However, a new group of Falangists recently came to Mexico on the Magellan ship. These people were ordered by Madrid to extract money from powerful Spanish businessmen after entering the country. If they do not obey, they are threatened with retaliation against their relatives in Spain. The Spanish Republicans in Mexico are now having extreme difficulty making a living due to the oppression of these people. (United Press, 23rd)

### Wu Shaoshu Gives a Speech in Hong Kong

Hong Kong - The unfortunate incident that occurred at the Shanghai Three Youth League at the end of August is still not well understood by the outside world. The reporter specially visited Mr. Wu Shaoshu, the director of the Shanghai branch, at his residence. According to him, "During my (Wu Shaoshu's self-proclaimed) absence from Shanghai, I was always concerned about all my enthusiastic young comrades, because my young comrades are striving hard in danger anytime, anywhere. Although the history of our League in Shanghai is short, the League's affairs have been able to develop rapidly and actively, which proves the patriotic heart of the youth community on the isolated island. I am willing to work together under the leadership of the League Leader, but in this special environment, our League is bound to be envied. When I was on my way to Shanghai for duty, I heard that Lu Zhe, a staff member of the branch, was lured, and then I learned that my comrades who were implicated, whether they were detained, or lost their studies or jobs as a result, or were otherwise affected, were able to fully express their spirit of not fearing difficulties and not surrendering, which really made me feel excited and ashamed. Today, the facts are obvious, the boundaries are clear, and it is not difficult for our youth community to choose the path they should take. As the leader of this branch, I will never give up, I will never be discouraged, and I swear to fight for light in the darkness with all my young patriots and complete the mission entrusted to us by the times.

### Greek Troops Advance Victoriously, Penetrating Over Twenty Miles into Albania; Remnants of Enemy Forces on the Korytsa Plateau Eliminated; Italian Troops Retreat Westward into Isolation

London: News has arrived that after the Greek army occupied Korytsa, they advanced and seized a town twenty-five miles north of it, and are continuing to push forward. The Greek army has now cut off the supply lines of the Italian forces operating east of the Korytsa-Florina road. (Reuter, 23rd)

Athens: Following the Greek army's capture of Korytsa, Albania's largest city, the momentum of the overall Greek advance has visibly increased, forcing the heavily pressured Italian forces into a rapid retreat. Greek cavalry is pursuing the Italians in the west and north of Korytsa, making rapid progress and giving them no opportunity to rebuild their shattered lines. The Greek army is now striving to attack Pogradec, to prevent this city on the southern border from being used as an Italian base. Another Greek force is advancing along the road between Korytsa and Elbasan. (Latest reports from Albania and the southern border claim that the Greek vanguard has crossed Pogradec, cutting off the only retreat route for Italian forces northeast of Korytsa. It is also reported that an entire battalion of encircled Italian troops, numbering 800 men, fled to the south and were detained.) War reports state that Greek motorized units are attacking the remnants of several Italian divisions some distance west and south of Korytsa, threatening to capture Argyrokastro, Italy's second base in Albania. News from the southwestern front indicates that three Italian divisions, each with 45,000 men, have been isolated with their backs to the Ionian Sea. (International News Agency, 23rd)

London: A Reuter dispatch from Athens states that Italian forces were seen retreating rapidly northwards from the Korytsa area last night, pursued closely by Greek tanks captured from the Italians. It is reported that these tanks were part of an Italian force dispatched to the front lines to relieve besieged Italian troops. However, as this relief force entered an area covered by Greek artillery fire, the Greeks launched a sudden attack, causing the force to collapse and many tanks to fall into Greek hands. Although the Greek artillerymen were unfamiliar with tank warfare, they quickly mastered the art of driving them and used these captured Italian weapons to attack the Italian forces. According to the latest news from the front last night, the 6,000-foot peak of Mount Ivan is now clear of enemy forces, and the entire Korytsa plateau has been cleared. The Greeks now control the entire southeastern corner of Albania, closing the door to the Italian offensive aimed at Salonika. The Greek front lines now extend into Albanian territory, at least five miles at their shallowest point, and there are no Italian troops left in Greek territory. (Reuter, 23rd)

Rome: According to the Italian military headquarters, Italian forces on the Greek front are shifting to new positions according to plan. Italian aircraft bombed streets, barracks, and positions around Korytsa, with considerable success. (Haitong, 23rd)

Rome: It has been announced here that Italian forces have withdrawn from Korytsa and established a new defensive line to the west of the city. This indicates that Greek forces have advanced at least ten miles into Albanian territory. The withdrawal was preceded by intense fighting, with large-scale hand-to-hand combat between Italian and Greek forces near Korytsa. The Italian forces then hastily dug shallow trenches for defense. The successful withdrawal of two Italian divisions was due to the protection provided by their rearguard, so the bulk of their forces did not suffer losses. This withdrawal is part of a military reorganization plan by the new Italian Commander-in-Chief, General Soddu. (United Press, 23rd)

Belgrade: According to reports in the local newspapers concerning the Italian-Greek battlefield, Italian forces have abandoned Korytsa and retreated to new positions in the Kamiia Mountains to the west. Another part of the force retreated towards Lake Ohrid. Heavy artillery and machine gun fire have been heard on the Yugoslav side of the lake since Thursday, indicating that the front lines are approaching the lake. It is rumored that Greek forces repeatedly attempted to break through and encircle the retreating Italian forces, but were repulsed. (Haitong, 23rd)

Budapest: According to news arriving here today, Italian forces have launched a counter-offensive to recapture Korytsa, Albania's largest city and an important Italian base for the invasion of Greece, which has now fallen into Greek hands. It is rumored that Italian aircraft are heavily bombing Korytsa, attempting to open a route for Italian forces to re-enter the city. Italian cavalry and motorized units in the regions near the Adriatic Sea are reportedly rushing towards Santi Quaranta and Argyrokastro, which are also important Italian bases. (International News Agency, 23rd)

Greek Prime Minister Encourages the Nation to Continue Fighting for Freedom

Athens: Greek Prime Minister and Commander-in-Chief Metaxas broadcast last night, stating that the brutal and treacherous Italians have launched an unprovoked attack, attempting to deprive us of what our lives hold dear. However, all of Greece has now risen up in unprecedented unity and strength, and the Greek army has given Mussolini a reply that he will never forget. Let Mussolini be told that we are united as one and determined not to be annihilated, but to exist in the world as a free and independent nation. We must now grit our teeth and raise our spirits. This struggle will be long and the road ahead will be difficult, but we are resolved to bear all hardships. (Reuter, 23rd)

Athens: General Papagos, Commander-in-Chief of the Greek army, issued a message to the Greek forces, concluding with: "May God protect you. Do not forget a short period of free life is better than forty years of slavery in prison. Advance, keep advancing, continue fighting, so that the enemy now collapsing in panic will never be able to recover." (Reuter, 23rd)

Athens: The Greek war has entered a new phase because of the capture of Korytsa, the completion of the clearing of the entire northeastern front, and the possibility that a large Italian force on the southern front may be cut off by Greek forces and unable to connect with its base in Santi Quaranta. As this new offensive proceeds, the Supreme Greek Military Command has warned its soldiers not to be overly optimistic and to be very cautious in battle and in advancing, so as to avoid making mistakes and falling into Italian traps or suffering a combined attack by Italian land and air forces. The military authorities also pointed out that the Greek army should pay particular attention to areas where the Italian army can use mechanized units, so as not to be caught in an ambush. (Taiwan Public News Agency, 23rd)

London: The Athens radio station officially announced yesterday that the battle of Korytsa was a victory for people fighting for survival. Greece is determined to continue fighting for a victorious end. To achieve this goal, we need more aircraft. The Greek army is continuing to achieve similar victories on the western front. Italian heavy artillery and a large amount of war material have been captured by the Greek army. The Italian ultimatum has now become a demon for the Italian people, who are now victims of Fascism. (Reuter, 23rd)

Celebration in Athens as the Whole Country Rejoices

Athens: When the initial reports of victory at Korytsa arrived, the entire city erupted in joy. Crowds marched and cheered, national flags flew everywhere, and the city's bells rang loudly. Reporters are now witnessing a sea of British and blue-and-white Greek flags in the central square. Every time a general appeared on the balcony of the Greek General Headquarters, the crowds in the street shouted "Take back Rhodes and the Dodecanese Islands!" Greek Prime Minister Metaxas only appeared on the balcony once when reporting the capture of Korytsa, at 12:30 PM, when the crowds in the street were very dense, as they had already heard the news. King George II of Greece and the British representative were also cheered by the crowds when they appeared on the balcony. Many soldiers and officers were mingled in the crowds, and military bands assisted. British soldiers were lifted onto shoulders, and women scattered flowers. (United Press, 23rd)

Residents of Korytsa Welcome the Greek Army

London: Details arriving in London regarding the fall of Korytsa describe the Italian side's final efforts to reverse the decline. On Wednesday, the Greek army consolidated its captured positions and launched a fierce bombardment of key Italian strongholds in Korytsa from dawn onwards. Italian defenses were initially quite stubborn, but subsequently collapsed and began to retreat, abandoning much war materiel. As the Greek army entered the city, it split its forces, with cavalry leading the pursuit of the retreating troops. Almost every house in Korytsa flew a Greek flag, and the entire population welcomed the Greek army with open arms. Many of the residents are Greek, who appear to have suffered abuse at the hands of the Italians in recent days. It is reported that when the Italian forces retreated, they abducted prominent military and civilian figures from Korytsa as hostages. During the fighting around Korytsa, an Italian battalion and a large amount of its war materiel were captured by the Greek army. (Reuter, 23rd)

Korytsa: The municipal authorities of Korytsa yesterday welcomed the victorious Greek army into this recently captured Albanian town, holding flags. The officials met a detachment of the Ivisonas army outside the city at 10:00 AM yesterday morning and escorted the troops to the Greek headquarters, where the Albanian mayor formally invited the Greek army to garrison the city. Many of the Muslim streets in the city have been consumed by large fires. Soldiers report that the residents were extremely joyful when they entered the city, as they have suffered from severe famine since the city was besieged. (United Press, 23rd)

Heavy Losses in Italian Retreat

Ohrid: Yesterday, as Italian forces fled from Greece towards Albania, their rearguard suffered losses of 500 dead and 1,000 wounded. Greek casualties in Korytsa were 280 dead and 400 wounded. Over the past 48 hours, Italian forces have been continuously retreating from Korytsa. Over 2,000 vehicles were engaged in transporting their military supplies to prevent them from falling into Greek hands. Italian forces were already aware of the impossibility of holding Korytsa when they suffered defeat a few days ago. The famous Greek Evzone units were the first to enter the city of Korytsa, followed by mechanized units and artillery. The artillery units continued to pursue the retreating forces. One hundred Albanian soldiers who had mutinied were also among the Greek forces attacking Korytsa. According to border reports, in the final battle of Korytsa, the Italians captured included 19 officers and 400 soldiers. The spoils of war included 80 tanks, 30 trucks, 7 heavy cannons, 28 machine guns, and much other war material. It is said that the victory owes much to the assistance of British bombers. (United Press, 23rd)

Athens: According to news from the front lines, Greek troops, upon entering Korytsa, discovered no less than several thousand tons of military supplies left behind by the Italian army. This alone demonstrates the importance of this stronghold. This immense amount of gasoline, munitions, weapons, and other supplies indicates that the Italian army had long concentrated a large quantity of military supplies there in preparation for a large-scale invasion of Salonika. To prevent these supplies from falling into Greek hands, the Italian army set fire to a large amount of supplies that could not be carried away in time. However, the rapid advance of the Greek army greatly surprised the Italian garrison in the city, which hastily abandoned its machine guns, munitions, freight cars, and other supplies and fled. It is estimated that these supplies can be used to supply two Greek divisions. (United Press, 23rd)

Athens: It is widely rumored that the commander of the Italian Fifth Regiment was among those captured during the collapse in Korytsa, and its military flag has also become a trophy of war. The Italian Second Regiment, of which Mussolini himself is the honorary commander, also retreated from Korytsa. (United Press, 23rd)

Various Districts: On Friday and Thursday nights, several fires were seen on the Greek mainland opposite the various districts, and explosions were heard. Lights were also seen moving north towards Santi Quaranta. It is believed that these were caused by retreating Italian troops burning military supplies and destroying roads. (Reuter, 23rd)

London: A statement from Rome Radio attempting to conceal the defeat of two Italian divisions in Korytsa claimed that these two divisions were only protecting the Italian headquarters and were not intended for any major battle sites. They held the line against superior Greek forces for eleven days, a remarkable achievement. The Italian High Command communiqué acknowledged the loss of Korytsa and stated that the Italian side suffered considerable losses, but the enemy's losses were similar or even greater. Italian reinforcements are now concentrating on a new defensive line. (Reuter, 23rd)

### British Industrial Centers Continue to be Heavily Attacked by German Aircraft; Low-Flying Bombing Turns Birmingham into an Inferno; Long-Range Guns Roar Along the Channel Coast

London: After the air raid alarm was lifted in London last night, there were several hours of peace and quiet, but a certain city in the West Midlands was heavily bombed by German aircraft. Enemy planes flew over the city in batches, attacking from all directions for several hours. High-explosive bombs landed in many areas, causing heavy material damage. Among the damaged buildings were one church and two monasteries. It is reported that another city was also heavily attacked. (Reuter, 23rd)

Berlin: Regarding the German air force's group attack on Birmingham last night, it is reported that the first batch of German aircraft departed at dusk yesterday and returned to base before midnight. According to the pilots, the entire city of Birmingham was on fire, with many city buildings burning incessantly. Small fires sprouted like bamboo shoots after a rain, all over the city. Low-flying German aircraft dropped large numbers of incendiary bombs, so the situation on the ground was clearly visible. The targets of the German aircraft's attack last night were munitions factories that had not been hit in previous bombings or had suffered only minor damage. When the German aircraft departed, it was raining, but when they arrived in England, the clouds cleared and the sky was clear, with excellent visibility, so various attack techniques could be used. The sudden change caused the British anti-aircraft guns to lose their effectiveness. This time, the German aircraft also used large-scale low-flying bombing to attack Birmingham, mainly targeting British aircraft manufacturing plants. All kinds of bombs were used, and the bombs fell like rain. The extent of the destruction is indescribable. (Haitong, 22nd)

### British Treasury: Currency Control, Promulgation of New Regulations

London - The currency control methods already adopted by many countries around the world have now been adopted by Britain. This is an unprecedented move in British monetary history. The British government has recently promulgated regulations authorizing the Treasury to allow payments to non-British residents, subject to conditions, namely, the payment to the payer's blocked account in the bank. The purpose of this regulation is to prevent non-British residents from converting British currency into foreign currency. Funds paid into blocked accounts can be used to purchase securities announced by the Treasury, and the interest generated by these securities will be handled in the same way as other securities held by non-British residents. In addition, there are new regulations requiring companies outside the sterling area but under British jurisdiction to notify banks of all their gold, foreign currency, or U.S. securities so that they can be sold to the Treasury. (Reuter's telegram on the 23rd)

### Vichy Government: Vigorously Purging Communists, Extending Efforts to Education

### Tragic European War (3): Three Protagonists in the French Tragedy

(3) Reynaud, Exhausted by Constant Response

Reynaud originally intended to concurrently hold the position of Minister of War, hoping to seize the critical moment to realize his ambitions and implement the military theories he had always championed. However, due to circumstances, he had to abandon the Sacred Department and retreat to head the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. If he had been able to concurrently hold the position of Minister of War, he would have immediately dismissed Gamelin and replaced the old-fashioned generals with people like General Giraud, who was known for his bravery and skill but was unfortunately captured by the German army. In reality, Reynaud's choice to abandon the Ministry of War and take up foreign affairs was indeed against his will and a helpless situation. At the time, public opinion was unaware of the truth and did not pay attention to the behind-the-scenes manipulations. Reynaud declared that he would make major changes, but when the list of twenty-two ministers and thirteen undersecretaries was announced, it was still filled with mediocre and incompetent people, which inevitably disappointed the nation. The old machine was indeed not running smoothly, and this new engineer did not seem to be making any progress. Although he established a War Committee in the cabinet, this negative impression still could not be erased. As a result, Parliament was in uproar. The right wing declared that this was the result of secret collusion between Socialist leader Léon Blum and Reynaud, and therefore refused to cooperate with the left wing in the cabinet. The so-called sacred alliance of all parties was shattered. Even within the Radical Party, there was no unity. Some important members of the party were already thinking of bringing down the cabinet even before it had taken any action. Daladier felt that this was too outrageous and tried to stop the enthusiasm of these conspirators. This kind of factionalism and mutual infighting, although it was not absent during the First World War from 1914 to 1918, was not as intense as it is today. The rampant individualism in Congress is a major crime in destroying French democracy, and it was not as dangerous as it later became. However, because the opposition occupied thirteen seats in the cabinet, the disputes subsided somewhat.

The situation in March 1940 was very different. In the reception room of the Chamber of Deputies, conspiracies and infighting emerged one after another, as if the country was peaceful and the world was at peace. Although the enemy had been preparing for war since 1933, the French people were still indulging in pleasure and trying to preserve their peaceful image, which was also a great misfortune for France.

Reynaud reversed the traditional French custom and read his government's policy statement in just eight minutes. He was already exhausted when he first took office, and he was further discouraged by the indifference of Parliament. Therefore, he answered the questions of the Parliament in a perfunctory manner, using familiar phrases. The result of the vote was that only one hundred and sixty-eight votes supported him, one hundred and fifty-six opposed him, and one hundred and eleven abstained. The number of opponents plus the number of abstentions totaled two hundred and sixty-seven votes. The government only had a one-vote advantage, which was truly difficult for a Prime Minister to achieve. When Reynaud learned of this result, he intended to resign that night, but later changed his mind and decided to stay in office, adjourning Parliament for ten days.

Reynaud had these ten days to take emergency measures and extend his power to Parliament and the country. But what could he do? No matter which way the Prime Minister went, the result was always "this road is blocked."

On March 23, after a meeting of the heads of national defense to coordinate the overall situation, Reynaud was still hesitant. Since then, he has held many meetings in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Prime Minister's office. No cabinet members participated in the secret meetings, but only his mistress, who acted as a political advisor and recklessly interfered in national affairs.

From a military point of view, large-scale war plans were still vague and ethereal. The official doctrine can be summarized by what General Gamelin said one day, which spread widely: "France and Germany, one has the Maginot Line, and the other has the Siegfried Line, both of which are as solid as gold. Whichever country moves first will be annihilated." On the other hand, since the plan to aid Finland became a bubble, the unease of the people after Daladier's resignation has not been dispelled. During the winter, there were many discussions on this matter, and there was no consensus. Both the left and right factions advocated sending troops on a distant expedition. The fate of this small Northern European country has aroused great emotional fluctuations among the French people and caused fierce debates. When there were divergent opinions, Daladier finally used his usual conciliatory means. However, public opinion was in an uproar, already showing impatience. This was a crucial key to France's destiny.

The French people also often exerted pressure and influenced the government's war policy during the previous wars. For example, in the First World War from 1914 to 1918, due to the prudence and steadiness of the commander-in-chief Joffre, public opinion demanded that Nivelle replace him, which almost caused an irreparable disaster. Although the French people were disgusted with war, once they were forced to fight, they would conduct it thoroughly, regardless of making unnecessary mobilizations. In the spring of 1940, after a long period of war silence, the French morale recovered to the strength of early September 1939, shouting the slogan "We must fight to the end," hoping that the new Prime Minister Reynaud could take strong initiatives.

Although Reynaud was driven by public opinion, he felt that there was no way out. Although he established a War Committee and led a wartime cabinet, he was always isolated and helpless. The Minister of War Daladier and the commanders of the army, navy, and air force, who opposed him, formed an unbreakable obstacle. At the end of March, General Weygand came to Paris from the Near East, and it was rumored that Prime Minister Reynaud would ask him to take the position of Commander-in-Chief. This statement did not materialize because replacing Gamelin would inevitably lead to Daladier's resignation, and his cabinet would immediately collapse.

Reynaud saw that the date of the resumption of Congress on April 2 was approaching, but he was still hesitant about the progress of the war and the selection of generals.

In addition to the Prime Minister, he also held the position of Minister of Foreign Affairs. However, the road ahead was turbulent, and he was facing difficulties with Léger, the Secretary-General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, who was known to be pro-Soviet. The Franco-Soviet alliance was the cornerstone of French foreign policy for many years, which maintained a part of the people's hearts, and most of them were from the staff. The most obvious reason was to hate the Bolshevik Soviet Union and oppose National Socialist Germany. Before the war, Reynaud had been fiercely attacked for his pro-Soviet stance. Therefore, after taking office, he was cautious and openly opposed "Soviet treachery," as his protest against the German-Soviet pact of August 1939, which could win the sympathy of the right wing in Congress. Sacrificing Léger could further ease the opposition of the conservatives. However, Reynaud did not have the courage to make a decisive decision on this matter. He only expressed an anti-Soviet stance.

This kind of situation, and the new methods of suppressing the Communist Party, still failed to gain Reynaud the prestige necessary to convince Congress. On March 26, when he made his first radio broadcast, there was no surprising news to report to the people. Although he did not have any extraordinary resolutions during this critical autumn of national crisis, he at least dared to speak resolutely, despite the unfavorable circumstances, and continued to demand sacrifices from the people. This was his consistent policy since he served as Minister of Finance, but the public rarely agreed with his views, and they disliked his tone, which was like a primary school teacher reciting a textbook. Reynaud, as the leader of the wartime government, was surprised to find that in the eyes of ordinary French people, he was "insignificant" or "incompatible." Therefore, this Prime Minister was helpless and could not adopt the old tricks of his predecessors, relying on public opinion to subdue Congress.

Since Reynaud was unable to implement any of the bold actions he had dreamed of, he had to imitate his predecessors and take a trip to London on March 27. Daladier claimed that he was unwell and refused to go with him. He knew that the fate of Reynaud's cabinet could be counted on the fingers, and this trip would be in vain. During this trip, Prime Minister Reynaud assured Britain that France would never negotiate peace alone. Little did he know that eighty days later, France would ask for an armistice alone.

### Uncertainty Surrounds Death of Scout Founder Baden-Powell

The English-language Ta Mei Wan Bao reported that the Havas News Agency recently reported the death of British Lord Baden-Powell, Chairman of the Boy Scouts Association and founder of the Boy Scouts. As a result, the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts of various countries in the city scheduled a memorial service at the Jiangxi Road Church at 10:45 AM on the 24th. However, this morning (the 23rd), a telegram was received from Reuters, stating that the report of Baden-Powell's death was incorrect. Therefore, the memorial service scheduled for tomorrow morning has been cancelled. According to reports, the Havas News Agency reported on Sunday that Baden-Powell had died in Nairobi, Africa. Scout leaders in the city dared not believe this report for three reasons: (1) no official news had been received; (2) other news agencies had not reported this news; and (3) no Shanghai listeners who listened to the BBC broadcasts had heard any mention of Baden-Powell's death. Therefore, on Tuesday, a telegram was sent to the UK for inquiry. As of yesterday (the 22nd), no reply had been received. Therefore, the Shanghai Reuters Agency was asked to investigate this matter. As a result, a telegram was received this morning, stating that the report of Baden-Powell's death was incorrect. The Boy Scouts were greatly relieved to hear this.

### Scott Cup First Week's Game: Donghua Eliminated Lax Yesterday, Result: 3-1, 2-0 in the First Half, Donghua's Lineup Change, but Cooperation Remains Tacit

The first week of the Scott Cup football match began yesterday. Donghua met Lax at Yiyuan. Although the sky was cloudy and threatening to rain, there were still five or six thousand spectators. Due to Cai Shengsen's injury, Donghua's lineup was changed, with Huang Kehou filling the position of center back and Jia Youliang filling the position of right forward. The cooperation was still quite tacit. In the first half, Donghua's Wan Jin and Jia Youliang each scored a goal, leading 2-0. After the break, Donghua's offensive was still strong. Finally, center forward Dai scored a goal with an accurate kick. However, ten minutes before the end, the Lax team's Attique pulled back one goal. In conclusion, Donghua eliminated Lax with a score of 3-1. The three goals scored by Donghua yesterday were all exceptionally clear and beautiful, and their skills have reached perfection.

Two Goals in a Row

Donghua kicked off, center forward Dai dribbled the ball forward, and Fei Chunhua took the first shot, but it was saved by Moso Guf. The Lax team took the opportunity to counterattack, but Li Ning failed to stop Huilai's shot, which went wide. After fifteen minutes, the Lax team's Kapustin went straight along the sideline and made a high pass. Qin Bigao patted the ball into a corner kick. Kapustin kicked it in, but Li Ning kicked it out not far away, and it bounced back. Fortunately, Qin was quick and threw it out, turning the danger into safety. Donghua's Han Longhai tried to send the ball to the enemy's goal from afar, but it was saved by the Moso goalkeeper. Before long, Wan Jin had a clever hook, and Jia Youliang headed the ball to the back. Fei passed the ball to Li Yichen, but Li kicked it too hastily and it went out of bounds. Then Liang Shutang took a long-range shot, which Moso Guf patted out with both hands. Fei Chunhua caught up and kicked it again, but it was blocked by Moso. Opportunities were frequently missed, but the offensive remained the same. Although the Lax team had several opportunities to attack, they failed to score due to inaccurate shots. Until the 37th minute, Donghua's Han Longhai passed the ball to Jia Youliang, who passed it to the left. Wan Jin took the opportunity to rush up and swept the ball into the net, breaking the deadlock. The atmosphere in the stadium was enlivened. Since Donghua had the advantage, Jia Youliang received a pass from Fei Chunhua in the 42nd minute and drove straight in. Moso Guf rushed out to save it, but it was too late, and Jia scored an empty goal. At the end of the first half, Lax was behind 0-2.

Three Versus One

After lemon, the two teams changed sides and fought again. The Lax team's offensive still did not improve. After the middle kickoff, it was blocked by the Donghua players. Li Yichen and Wan Jin connected to attack. Wan passed the ball to the front, and Fei Chunhua hooked it in with a mat. Center forward Dai jumped up and headed the ball out of bounds. After ten minutes, the Lax team attacked. Qin Bigao received the ball, but because the enemy general was in front, he could not kick it out, and he moved back and forth, and was penalized a fence ball. Simmons took the free kick and lightly passed it to Huilai's feet. Huilai swept it out of bounds. Donghua's good luck came. After fifteen minutes, center forward Dai received a pass from Li Yichen and swept it in, leading by 3-0. The Lax team hurriedly tried to recover the lost ground, but the Donghua defense was tight, and they failed to succeed for a long time. Instead, the Donghua offensive was fierce. Fei Chunhua dribbled the ball forward, but Gleenberg failed to block him. Fei's shot was patted into a corner kick by Moso Guf. Fei kicked it in, but it was kicked out by Gleenberg. Soon, the Lax team's Hani was penalized for a foul on a ball steal. Liang Shutang took the free kick. Fei Chunhua got it, but he was too anxious, and it flew over the crossbar. Until the 35th minute, the Lax team's Attique got the help of Kapustin. Qin Bigao rushed out to steal the ball, and the goal was wide open. Attique flicked it into the empty goal (1-3), returning a goal. After this, both sides had shooting opportunities, but they failed to score any more goals and just wasted time. At the end of the regular time, Donghua eliminated Lax with a score of 3-1 and advanced to the second week.

Samsung Defeats Wenbin 4-2

In the first match, Samsung faced Wenbin. Mr. Zhu Shunlin, the cup donor, performed the opening kickoff ceremony. Wenbin advanced with its entire force, breaking through defenses. Zhou Qilin and Feng Pengshou carelessly lost Jingzhou. Zhou Bingrong was not polite and scored with one kick. Following that, Liu Zhiquan launched a surprise attack and retreated successfully.

Red Star Defeats Zhenhua 4-0

In the second match, Red Star faced Zhenhua.

Gao Baozheng opened the scoring amidst cheers. Following that, Cao Qinfang launched a cold arrow, hitting the mark. In the first half, Red Star took the lead with a score of 2-0. At the beginning of the second half, Zhenhua initially seemed disadvantaged, and the entire army counterattacked. Red Star's two inside guards, Jiang Chao and Meng Yiliang, were the most active and prominent. Zhang Mingsheng in the middle sailed smoothly, displaying divine shooting skills, with the ball like a cannonball, making it Red Star's world. The final score was 4-0, with Zhenhua suffering a major defeat.

Today's Finals

### Grain - Foreign Rice Continues to Plunge - Although Japonica Rice Dropped Slightly by One or Two Yuan, Trading Has Not Opened Up

Yesterday, the foreign rice market suddenly turned to a decline. After a continuous rise, not only did the floating hoards of warehouses want to sell at high prices, but also foreign firms were throwing out spot goods in large quantities, causing people's hearts to become uneasy and actual sales to shrink. Those who thought about trading were mostly sellers and few buyers. Because of this, the market was flooded with goods, and under mutual competition to sell, the market could hardly support itself and gradually declined. From the opening of the market in the morning until the close of the market, the downward trend did not stop. As a result, the closing price was one yuan lower than before. The prices were as follows: Saigon No. 1, 72.5 yuan, 72 yuan; Saigon No. 2, 69.3 yuan, 68 yuan; Fire Fine, 71 yuan to 69 yuan; Selected Luo No. 2, 67 yuan, 66.5 yuan; Small Fine, 66.5 yuan, 66 yuan. Yesterday, another foreign firm offered to sell 3,000 tons of Small Fine futures at 72 yuan, causing even more instability. Therefore, after the market opened in the morning, it fell across the board. After the futures fell slightly by two yuan, there was some buying to cover short positions and bargain hunting, and the market stabilized slightly at noon. In the afternoon, it remained flat and soft, with Saigon No. 1 futures rising.

January: 82 yuan; No. 2 December: 79 yuan to 78.5 yuan; November: 80 yuan and 8 jiao; Small Fine: 78 yuan to 7 yuan and 9 jiao. Warehouse holders sold more than they bought, with only 200 tons traded, and there were fewer than 5,000 bags of spot rice.

The arrival of new top quality and green wild rice was sluggish, with only slightly over 1,000 shi. However, most buyers were unwilling to purchase much due to concerns that the weather was hot and humid, and that the rice would not last long. When they saw that foreign rice was weak, they were not willing to purchase much, in addition to slight addition of stock. As a result, the sales market stagnated. Although the price fell by one or two yuan, most of the goods still could not be traded. The price for original package new japonica high-quality goods was 91 yuan, 86-87 yuan by the dou; the price for tea variety by the dou was 80 yuan, and the remaining goods were not sold.

Although the glutinous rice sales market was ordinary, fortunately the market quality was limited, presenting a sluggish situation, and the prices did not fluctuate much.

Flour Market is Brewing

The flour market is still brewing. In addition to providing small quantities for daily use on this street, factories are unwilling to supply large quantities because wheat prices are unusually high and production is low. Most factories may increase prices early next week. Old Junzhan single goods took the opportunity to rise, but there were no substantial transactions. Due to frequent transshipments, there was no large outflow of foreign flour. Double Eagle brand high-quality goods still require 19 yuan, and those decided earlier vary in price. It is heard that Shou brand requires 19.5 yuan, with 100 bags purchased by this street. The market situation is slightly uneven.

The wheat market remains firm and high because although the quantity of goods coming from the mainland is not large, the Chinese factories seem to be slowing down in purchasing foreign wheat now that new shipments have arrived. Japanese factories are also paying attention to receiving and unloading goods and are no longer receiving retail, so the market is firm and calm. It is heard that the price of Changxi Sukun Du wheat is 27 yuan, and an additional yuan or more is required to transport it into the concession. 300 to 400 bags are sent to factories daily.

Oil Cake - Rumors of Dalian Lifting the Ban - Oil Price Plunges by Three Yuan

The soybean oil market continued to be affected by rumors of Dalian lifting the ban. Morale was low. There were still people inquiring about spot goods in the morning. In the afternoon, the market only had sounds of short selling and short covering. Therefore, the price drop was strong. Although there was a brief rise, it was only a fleeting moment, and the bulls were at a loss. As a result, both futures and spot goods fell sharply by three yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. 100 dan of dayou factory soybean oil were traded at a price of 84 yuan. 400 pieces of Jiaozhou raw oil were traded at 76 yuan to 74.5 yuan. 10 barrels of Qingdao raw oil were traded at 101 yuan. Over 2,000 barrels were ordered for delivery in December at 105 yuan to 102.25 yuan.

380 bags of soybeans came from Tianjin on the 23rd, and 200 bags of soybeans, 900 local bags of raw kernels, and 980 cans of raw oil were exported to Hong Kong on the 24th.

Securities - Buying and Selling Compete Several Times - Bond Market Still Rises

In the securities grey market, the trend was that bulls and bears competed fiercely yesterday. Floating shorts continued to dump, while overseas Chinese and the financial community continued to absorb them. When the floating shorts are almost completely cleared, the market price will inevitably have a surprising surge. The current situation is gradually changing from floating and unreal to solid strength, and the number of short sellers is gradually increasing. Therefore, the foundation of the bulls is extremely solid. In the current excellent environment, it is nurtured and cultivated, and slightly supported. Its vigorous momentum will inevitably be unstoppable. Observation of the recent absorption aspect for several days shows that they all have huge strength, such as the North Gang No. 14 Tongji, No. 16 Xinhua Bank, and No. 25 Guangbang Shengda Trust Company, which are constantly absorbing. The entire city was still buying yesterday, and the number was increasing. The remaining Yichang, Jiufeng, Tongshun, Lianyi, Dingkang, Xinfu, Hengfu, and Lemao were also very enthusiastic about buying, especially Xinzile and Lemao. Xieda, Tongkang, and Renchang launched large amounts of long positions, while Lianhe, Yongfeng, Cunyi, Dafeng, and Xinchang were still short selling. Therefore, although the market price fluctuated frequently, the trend was very slow. After several competitions, it was still better by two or three jiao to half a yuan. Ninety-six, which has been ignored for a long time, also rose eight jiao yesterday. Class B saw a new high price. The total number of transactions was about 3 million yuan. Here is a brief table of 50 shares of stock, priced at 41 yuan and 1 jiao.

Stock trading: 50 shares of Guangqin Yarn Factory were traded at a price of 41 yuan 1 jiao.

London, 22nd (Friday) dispatch: The listed market for Chinese foreign debt and Far East British company stocks is still sluggish today, and the market conditions have not changed.

Hengye Real Estate Dividend

Full Year 1 Yuan 4 Jiao

The final dividend of the British Hengye Real Estate Co., Ltd. for the year ending September 1940 is 1 yuan per share of national currency, plus the interim dividend already paid, totaling 1 yuan and 4 jiao.

### Financial Commentary - Saint Kay - November 23rd - Shanghai's Trade

Although Shanghai's trade is different from that of the free Chinese ports, in terms of the nature and situation of trade, its proportion in the overall Chinese trade is still worthy of the attention of those who study the Chinese economy. It cannot be ignored just because the Jianghai Customs is not controlled by China. On the contrary, attention should be paid to the evolution of trade after it is not controlled.

Taking the proportion of Shanghai's trade in the national trade in the past two years (based on the cumulative figures for the first nine months of these two years), import trade has decreased from about 50% of the national trade last year to about 40% this year, while export trade has increased from 50% of the national trade last year to 70% this year. Regardless of whether the result of Shanghai's trade balance is a deficit or a surplus, the development trend is that exports increase and imports decrease, which is beneficial to China's international balance of payments and the stability of Shanghai's foreign exchange market. This cannot be denied.

Recently, I saw the trade situation of the Shanghai Jianghai Customs in October, as well as the cumulative trade situation in the past ten months of this year. Based on the statistical figures and personal observations, I will briefly comment on Shanghai's trade.

Shanghai's trade has been greatly affected by the European war. Since May of this year, after the German army invaded Holland and Belgium, the Shanghai exchange market tightened and then suddenly relaxed, resulting in a more significant change in the trade situation. Taking imports as an example, before the European war, trade with European countries accounted for 17% of Shanghai's imports. When Germany invaded the Scandinavian Peninsula, the proportion had fallen to 10%, and after the invasion of Holland and Belgium on May 10, it fell further to about 7%. However, taking the entire import trade as a whole, because of the advance of the United States in Shanghai's trade, and the development of Vietnam, the Dutch East Indies, Thailand, Burma, and other places to Shanghai, from January to April, it rose sharply from 14 million customs gold units to 35 million gold units. After May, the Shanghai foreign exchange gradually relaxed, which was naturally beneficial to import trade. Therefore, from a sharp reduction of 25.6 million gold units at the end of May, it gradually rose to 31.8 million gold units in July. After that, due to the situation in Vietnam and the fluctuating trend of the Shanghai foreign exchange market, it decreased to 28.9 million gold units in August, fell sharply to 20.8 million gold units in September, and reached a low of 19.49 million gold units in October.

### The Economic Life of Employees in the Banking Industry - Tang Tu

Recently, there has been a debate about the work and life issues of employees in the banking industry. However, the issue of employee compensation has not been fully disclosed. I am willing to provide a brief report at the cost of some words, as a comparison of the economic life of ordinary commercial employees.

The salary standard for ordinary employees of the banking industry - allowing for junior employees - and especially junior employees of commercial banks or money houses, starts from 16 yuan, or 20 yuan, with a salary increase of 5 yuan or 10 yuan every two years; trainees only receive subsidies of 8 yuan, 10 yuan, and 12 yuan, which increase with age. After three years, they are officially hired as bank employees. Therefore, to qualify as a bank employee, one must have at least a high school or equivalent education, and to earn a salary of 40 to 50 yuan, one must spend more than ten years in the bank; (starting from a trainee) even college-educated people, when they enter the bank, although they can receive a subsidy of 40 yuan, they are only officially hired as bank employees after one year, and they only have a chance to get a salary increase after three years, and it depends on your popularity.

The majority of employees in the banking industry earn an average salary of 30 yuan. Based on the salary before the war, the current salary has been increased once (some have never been increased), by 5 yuan or 10 yuan, plus a subsidy of 20-30%, totaling only about 50 yuan in salary and subsidies, plus housing subsidies of more than 10 yuan (some banks do not have them) and food subsidies (offset by their own meals), totaling about 70 yuan in actual income. After deducting savings, income tax, refugee donations, etc., the net income is only about 60 yuan. There are many more colleagues than in ordinary businesses. Weddings, funerals, and celebrations cannot be avoided. Regardless of whether the person is rich or poor, the minimum gift is 2 silver dollars. The year-end tips for tea boys cannot be avoided either. Round-trip transportation costs 10 yuan per month. In reality, only about 40 yuan are left. Even if there is no family burden, a husband and wife renting a small house will have to pay 30 yuan. May I ask, how can the wife's three meals a day be maintained with the remaining 10 yuan? But then again, does the family of a small bank employee have to suffer? No - definitely not, they still have to live. As far as I know, some are subsidized by large families, some rely on part-time jobs, or subsidize their income by engaging in small speculation (here, speculation becomes a social economic problem), or pawn and borrow, or even live beyond their means. From the "externally strong but internally weak" nature of small bank employees, it can be seen that the brilliance of the social exterior can be seen by everyone, while the dark side of society is often overlooked. Now, let's compare the treatment of employees in the banking industry with that of ordinary commercial employees:

(1) Salary increases for employees in the banking industry depend on the bank's intentions, and cannot be demanded or improved according to the cost of living like ordinary workers.

(2) Ordinary businesses can have year-end bonuses to share, such as yarn factories and textile factories, which have made great profits in the past two years, and the year-end bonuses can be up to 40 or 50 months of salary. Banking only has a rigid year-end bonus of two or three months (subsidies are not included), and after the war, it has been reduced to two months. The year-end tea boy festival awards are even all spent.

(3) Ordinary businesses have promotions, but banking does not.

(4) Ordinary businesses have the flexibility of advance payments, temporary loans, and deferred payments. If employees in the banking industry encounter unexpected family events, there is no solution.

The economic life of employees in the banking industry is not as noble as outsiders imagine. As the saying goes, "Outsiders don't know what's going on inside." The treatment of employees in the banking industry is not enough to compare with the Marxist theory of surplus value, and is even inferior to ordinary large companies and firms. Here, it must be stated that only those who are wealthy and use being a member of the bank as a facade for their profession, their extravagant lifestyle, cannot represent the entire banking staff.

### Finance - Bulls Reluctant to Persist in Foreign Exchange - Selling Off Excess Supply

Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: HSBC's listed prices did not rise or fall. In the British and American grey market, the price had relaxed beyond the 6 yuan level, breaking the silence of many days. The reason was that the bulls were reluctant to hold on for a long time, and they tended to sell off, once resulting in an excess of supply, reaching as high as 6.1875 yuan. Later, Sassoon and others settled in, and the potential slightly rebounded. As a result, at the close of the market, the US exchange rate was announced at 6 yuan, with a shilling of 3 pence 796875. In the afternoon, there was no market on Saturdays, and the British and American exchanges each rose by 0.0325 and 0.0625 compared with the previous day. Futures were the same.

US Exchange Rate Once Reached 6 Yuan

In the early morning, the long-term and short-term prices of large London items continued to fall by 0.0625, the New York price remained half, the London raw gold was fixed, the exchange rates between the British and the American exchanges and Shanghai were flat, the American exchanges to the British exchanges were not history, the exchanges to Shanghai were a large three points, and there was no market to the French exchanges. Central bank's listed prices for various exchanges remained the same as before. Banks opened spot selling prices in the morning: British gold was 3 pence 76565, and the US exchange rate was 5.9375 yuan, both exchanges being flat compared to the previous day. After opening, they immediately strengthened. Foreign banks did spot trading for the US exchange rate at 5.96875 yuan, followed by speculators and Hong Kong electricity companies stuffing in madly, and the long-term situation was endless. This month has been as high as 6 yuan to 6.03125 yuan. HSBC's listed prices were announced without moving. The silver balance tax was announced to be reduced by 0.50%. HSBC also released the foreign banks' US exchange rate for this lower month, which was the same as before, while Hong Kong Electricity Company resold the US exchange rate for this month as cheap as 6.1875 yuan. Finally, Sassoon suddenly started buying, and Chinese merchants followed, and the price tightened. It is estimated that a certain American bank and foreign banks sold the US exchange rate for this month at 6 yuan. At the close, British gold spot prices for the recent period were 3 pence 796875, and for the lower month 3 pence 78125. The US exchange rate for both futures and spot prices was announced at 6 yuan, an increase of 0.03125 compared to the previous day. US 0.0625, no market in the afternoon.

Hong Kong British and American Exchange Rates Unchanged

Hong Kong, 13th (Saturday) dispatch: The exchange market opened flat this morning, and the British and American exchange rates did not rise or fall. The Shanghai exchange rate rose by 5 jiao to 397 yuan, and the Japanese exchange rate tightened by 1 yuan to 104.5 yuan. At 1:30, it was announced that the exchange rate was flat, and there were no changes in the exchange rates in the afternoon, and there was no market on Saturdays.

Tianjin Exchange Rate Strengthens

Tianjin, 11th (Saturday) dispatch: The exchange market opened flat this morning. The London exchange rate strengthened by 125 to 4 pence 28115. The New York telegraphic exchange rate strengthened by 15625 to 6.78125 yuan. The Shanghai exchange rate fell by 1 yuan to 87.5 yuan, and the "Joint Currency" grey market still opened at 92 yuan (the telegraphic code may have errors).

Gold Market First Falls and Then Rebounds - Reaches 5,600 Yuan Level Again

Yesterday's spot gold grey market fell and then rebounded, but the result was still weak. Due to the odd loosening of foreign exchange, the US exchange rate had already exited the 6 yuan level, and people's hearts were greatly affected, and they sold off one after another. At one point, it dropped to 5,565 yuan. Although it fluctuated in the middle, the momentum of the sellers was greater. It was heard that the securities gang and silver shops were the first retail investors to buy in, slightly maintaining it. The closing price was 5,502 yuan, a small squeeze of 30 yuan. The outside market was still stable after closing. The price of silverware initially fell by 10 yuan, but eventually remained unchanged. Customs gold was flat.

Spot Gold Falls 33 Yuan

In the early morning, the market opened flat due to the needs of the silver shops. The gold shop entered 20 taels of silver into the silver shop, priced at 5,625 yuan, 10 yuan lower than the previous day. Before long, the gold shop entered 30 taels of silver into the silver shop, priced at 5,632 yuan. However, because the foreign exchange was reported to be strengthening, buyers stopped, and it was immediately frustrated into the 5,600 yuan level. It is estimated that the securities gang exited 20 taels of silver to the silver shop, priced at 5,590 yuan. Later, the money exchange industry purchased 30 taels from the securities gang, priced at 5,605 yuan. Finally, the foreign exchange continued to rise, and the securities gang and silver shops joined forces to spit out, and the selling wind was quite strong, and the lowest dropped to 5,565 yuan. Fortunately, retail investors saw the cheap price and absorbed it, and it rebounded to 5,605 yuan. It is estimated that the gold shop traded 10 taels, but the money exchange industry sold 30 taels to the gold shop again, and it was priced at 5,585 yuan. Before the close, the foreign exchange had slightly tightened, and the gold shop entered 110 taels of silver into the silver shop, and it became 5,600. No market in the afternoon. The squeeze was 33 yuan smaller than the day before yesterday, with an up and down movement of 67 yuan in half a day. The spot price was 6-7 yuan lower than the futures price. The swap buyer paid 6 yuan to the seller, and 300 taels were traded. The selling price of the spot gold shop's own brand gold was more than 10 yuan higher than that of spot gold, and the purchase price was 30 yuan lower. The current bid gold was 5-60 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there was little trading.

Silverware Falls and Rebounds

The price of silverware per tael was reduced by 10 yuan at 10:40 in the morning. It is estimated that Datonghang changed to 570 yuan, and the new Tonghang was similar to the previous price. At 1:30 in the afternoon, it rose by 10 yuan, and it was estimated to be 580 yuan. The purchase price was about 30 yuan lower.

Foreign Currency Continues to Fall

Yesterday's foreign currency market situation: the spot gold market price finally saw a decline. British and American gold pounds also continued to fall by 1 yuan. The market price of British and other tickets remained unchanged and flat. The price of US dollar tickets had initially fallen to 16 yuan 1 jiao 8 fen, but because Sassoon and others had a good appetite for the black market exchange rate, people's hearts were relatively stable, and the market price slightly rebounded, and it was finally 16 yuan 3 jiao, 6 fen lower than the previous day. The price of Hong Kong tickets suddenly fell by 3 fen. There was still little change in the prices of Japanese gold, Cai, and Korean tickets. The former still stood at the original price of 1 yuan 5 jiao 3 fen, and the latter was still 1 yuan 1 jiao 5 fen.

Yarn and Cotton - Short Covering Slightly Rises - Yarn Market Recovers

The yarn market, which had fallen on the previous day, rebounded yesterday. This was because the short sellers overthrew the normal track. Unexpectedly, the general bulls with sufficient capital did not sell off when the price was within 1,200 yuan, but intended to buy and add more. Therefore, the short covering was beneficial, and the stage was bare. Therefore, the market trend turned upward. However, actual sales still did not improve. However, it was rumored in the market that a certain bank would open, and speculators came to buy again. Checking that in one ten-day period, the price of 20-count horse yarn had fallen straight from 1,295 yuan to 1,183 yuan, a drop of 102 yuan. It is okay for some people to enter, but the sales side is relatively lacking. Today, there were 65 pieces of cotton yarn transported to Hong Kong and 130 pieces transported to Yantai.

Spot yarn opened in the morning. Because the shorts were very active on the previous day, people's spirits were slightly lifted, and they took the opportunity to advance. The first price of 20-count double horse was 1,190 yuan, slightly rising to 1,199 yuan. The outside exchange rate opened slightly stronger, and the shorts frequently suppressed it, falling to 1,183 yuan. At this time, the big players did not move, and it rose again to 1,192 yuan. However, due to sluggish real demand, it retreated again to 1,183 yuan. In an instant, it was said that the exchange in the city rose sharply. At the same time, there was a rumor of "a certain bank" being admired, and buying and short covering came one after another. The market suddenly rose to 1,203 yuan at the close. Checking that the half-day turnover was 6,027 packages, the price of 20-count double horse rose by 5 yuan. The amount of each gang's purchase is listed as follows:

Cotton Market Quiet

The current cotton situation remains quiet, but sales are flat. However, overseas Indian American cotton has turned upward, so people's hearts are relatively firm and high. Fire machine cotton is 208 yuan, and Changyinsha is 238 yuan.

The overseas cotton market price, the New York cotton market, is very active and very firm. Later, due to the search by overseas merchants and the purchase by spot merchants, the closing price rose more than 10 pounds compared to the previous day. Yesterday, India rose by more than 6 rupees.

The transaction of Shanghai foreign cotton has always been unusually quiet in recent days. The factory's attitude is temporarily waiting and watching. No trade has been heard from fellow tradesmen. All parties have a faint mind and are waiting for the development of the situation.

Piece Goods - Floating Shorts Sell Off - Prices of Small Amount of Cloth are Chaotic

The market for factory cloth is tired, and selling plates are difficult to maintain. The floating shorts are unanimously inclined to sell, so the price of small amounts of cloth is very chaotic. Some coarse and fine cloths and dyed cloths are slightly cheaper by one or two jiao per piece. The Cantonese and Hong Kong gangs continue to have strong sales rights, so they get the actual need to quote a firm price for various cloths. The Cantonese and Hong Kong gangs are handling more than 300 pieces of government silk, dyed cloths, coarse and fine cloths, twill, etc. The Fujian gang is also handling more than 100 pieces. The Zhejiang Road Wen Yong gangs are handling slowly. More than 400 pieces of various goods were traded on this street. 2,000 pieces of various bleached and dyed cloths were handled for Singapore, Siam, and other places abroad. Today, there are 135 pieces of piece goods transported to Yantai, and 1,225 pieces transported to Hong Kong.

East Cloth - Yesterday, because the yarn market rebounded slightly, people's hearts turned firm, and the selling plate was slightly raised. White goods leader Fine Cloth opened at 34.25 yuan, and short covering and new buyers rose one after another. The highest price was 34.6 yuan, and the closing price at noon was 34.5 yuan. Four gentlemen's serge was 1 yuan, 06 fen, 375. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday, and the market atmosphere has gradually stabilized.

### This Factory's Riding Breeches - Stable Prices -

Riding breeches have recently seen a surge in business due to the increased demand for overcoats. Their sales have naturally expanded, with continued broad demand from buyers. Numerous small orders have been placed. Black, white, and silver colors are selling very well. Their standard selling price has not increased due to high sales, but has instead remained stable. The main reason for this is that while imported stocks are limited, with each yard selling for forty yuan, making an overcoat typically requires one hundred seventy or eighty yuan, reducing purchasing power compared to before. Domestically produced goods from factories such as Ewo, Yongxing, Zhanghua, Deda, and Xiexin are abundant, creating a situation where supply exceeds demand, thus leading to brisk sales at stable prices.

Coarse White Sugar Declines

Yesterday's sugar market trend was quiet due to it being the weekend. Spot prices for coarse white sugar from foreign warehouses were 71.50 yuan, SK mark for late November shipments was 71.70 yuan, and HX mark from East Warehouse was 68.30 yuan, a decrease of 0.50 yuan compared to the previous day (November 22nd).

North-South Goods - Limited Arrival of Green Cakes

Since the new crop of green cakes became available, arrivals have been scarce. Only a few dozen pieces arrived yesterday, brought in independently by trading firms, selling for 38 yuan. With limited stocks, the market is quite lively.

Also, 250 bales of dried peaches were shipped from Tianjin yesterday (November 23rd).

Coal - Hongji White Coal - Stockpilers Eager to Sell

The white coal market has been declining since Bingxing and Tongdeli made public sales. New shipments of Hongji lump coal and slack are also arriving in large quantities soon. As a result, confidence is waning, and stockpilers are eager to unload their inventory. Customers are advised to bargain for lower prices, as unofficial prices are unsupported and falling. Hongji white coal warehouse receipts are already being quoted at 250 yuan, a decrease of 10 yuan per ton compared to the previous market price. However, prices at local shops are still holding firm for now, but a reduction is expected soon.

### Concession Authorities Maintain Food Supply for the People - Decisive Ban on Rice and Grain Exports - Strict Crackdown on Rice Shops Selling Adulterated Rice - Flat-Priced Flour Mill Rates Slightly Increased - Various Clan Associations Advocate Group Rice Purchases to Increase Reserves

The commission for rice shops in the city to sell rice is stipulated by the Shanghai Rice and Grain Evaluation Committee to be 1.50 yuan per bag higher than the market price. They are not allowed to increase this at will, and strict measures will be taken against selling adulterated rice and grain. Otherwise, a report will be submitted to the concession authorities for legal action. However, as rice prices have continued to rise, some rice merchants with ulterior motives have been mixing similar-looking grains into good rice to reduce costs and sell at high prices, thus doubling their profits. The relevant authorities hope that citizens will pay attention to this. If such a situation is discovered when purchasing rice, it can be reported to the authorities, who will severely punish the offenders. It has also been decided to strictly prohibit the transfer of rice and grain to other areas, in order to ensure the food supply for the citizens of this city. Those who dare to smuggle exports privately will be severely punished as a warning to others.

Flat-Priced Flour Mill Rates Slightly Increased

The Municipal Council previously received a petition from various businesses in the concessions, including bakeries, noodle shops, pancake and fried dough stick vendors, steamed bun shops, noodle restaurants, and dough sellers, stating that the rising flour prices were making it difficult to continue operations, and requesting relief. After negotiations, Fufeng and Fuxin flour mills agreed to supply 8,065 bags of flour daily (except Sundays) from October 11th, with Fufeng supplying 4,965 bags and Fuxin supplying 3,100 bags. The mill price was 17 yuan per bag, and the designated flour retailers were allowed to charge a handling fee of 30 cents, totaling 17.30 yuan per bag. The required amount for each user was verified and approved by the Municipal Council, and they purchased the flour from the retailers with a letter from the Council. Since its implementation, the flour market has been stable and the businesses in the concessions have benefited greatly, due to the overall consideration of the situation by the two mills and the retailers. As the price of imported wheat has increased and the cost of flour has risen, the Municipal Council, after consultation with the two mills, has approved an increase in the mill price of the aforementioned flour from 17 yuan to 18 yuan per bag, effective from the 25th of this month. The handling fee for the retailers will remain at 30 cents, totaling 18.30 yuan per bag. At the same time, due to limited flour reserves, Fufeng will reduce its flour supply by half (to 2,482 bags), starting from the same date. However, Fuxin will increase its supply by 2,483 bags daily from the 25th to the 30th of this month, in addition to its original 3,100 bags, to compensate for Fufeng's reduction. All businesses that normally receive flour from Fufeng daily should transfer half of their required amount to Fuxin. The purpose of this increase in the mill price is to enable the mills to barely cover their costs and continue to order imported wheat, while also ensuring that the flour supply is not disrupted.

Ample Rice Reserves Should Prevent Price Increases

The rice market has been rising sharply in recent days, without any sign of stopping. Although prices have fallen somewhat yesterday, statistics show that increases have outnumbered decreases, making it difficult for ordinary people to make ends meet, and even causing hardship for the middle class. However, the actual situation is quite different. The amount of domestic and foreign rice arriving at the port this month is considerable. On average, about 2,000 piculs of domestic rice arrive daily. Over 400,000 bags of foreign rice have been shipped in by foreign vessels in the past two weeks. The rice reserves in warehouses alone have increased from over 500,000 bags to 700,000 bags. Under such favorable circumstances, rice prices should have decreased dramatically. However, not only has there been no decline, but there has been an abnormal surge. Such a contradictory phenomenon is perplexing. Those who manipulate the rice market often cite the unstable situation and the inconvenience of deliveries as excuses for raising prices without hesitation whenever there is news. However, during periods of crowded inventories, they are unwilling to sell at lower prices. The upper echelons emulate the lower, making it impossible to stop the cycle. Fair-minded people from all walks of life in this city, as well as newspaper forums, have been issuing strong reprimands daily, hoping that hoarders will show some humanity and justice, so that ordinary people can eke out a living and barely survive the extraordinary times. It is necessary to be strict with oneself and enforce stringent measures, and not only to consider private interests while neglecting public justice. If rice prices can be quickly lowered, then comparing the current supply to actual sales, there is no need to worry about the future of the food supply in this city. Even during the lean spring months, there will be no impact. The People's Food Adjustment Association, public organizations, and Shanghai clan associations are all conducting group rice purchases, so there is no need to use reserves.

Severe Punishment Needed to Curb Rice Profiteers

The low-priced rice sales have been held for seven periods, benefiting millions of people. However, the association has suffered huge losses with each sale. The current sale ended one day earlier than scheduled due to a shortage of broken rice and will be suspended. Later, after encouragement from the Public Concession Municipal Council to cooperate with each other, the low-priced rice sales association first ordered broken rice from Saigon and planned to convene a meeting of the entire committee to determine if funds were available, so that the eighth low-priced rice sale could continue in the middle of next month or early in the twelfth lunar month. It is hoped that enthusiastic people from all walks of life will actively contribute, so that the common people can barely survive the winter. All sectors also believe that the concession authorities' measures to punish rice merchants and hoarders have been reiterated repeatedly, and market supervisors have been appointed. However, the effectiveness is minimal. Over time, people have become accustomed and disregard the law. Even those who are arrested for spreading rumors are only fined and detained for a few hours. It is hoped that the Municipal Council can enforce the law strictly, without favoritism or compromise. If they can act decisively and punish those who deserve it, then the rice prices in this city may gradually get back on track, and there will be no more abnormal situations.

### Foreign Observer Discusses - British-Soviet Relations - Could Sign a Non-Aggression Pact

A foreign observer in this city recently discussed Molotov's visit to Berlin, stating that the contradictions and conflicts between Germany and the Soviet Union are undeniable. Although the two countries may reach a temporary compromise or even conclude some kind of agreement, the growing strength of Britain will eventually cause a shift in the attitudes of the Soviet Union and other powerful countries in the world. Given the proposal made by British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Sir Stafford Cripps to Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky on October 22nd, it is even more likely that the Soviet Union may further conclude a permanent non-aggression treaty with Britain. Furthermore, with Britain's great victory in Thailand, the Soviet Union will recognize Britain's strength, that it is neither an enemy of the country nor inferior to Germany. Moreover, Italy's encounter with fierce resistance from the Greek army has given Britain a great strategic advantage. Since the outbreak of the Italian-Greek war, Britain has acquired some Greek islands that can be used as naval and air bases. These bases can exert Britain's naval and air power to deal an even greater blow to Italy. Therefore, any agreement between Germany and the Soviet Union at present will have no adverse impact on Britain.

### Correcting the Abuses of Clothing Distribution - Centralized Registration of the Poor - An Indelible Mark Inked on the Arm - The Charity Federation Will Verify and Issue Clothing Vouchers

During winter clothing distribution, the poor pawn the clothes, and cunning individuals beg for a set from Charity A and then beg again from Charity B. Often, one person can obtain multiple sets, while the elderly and weak are left empty-handed. This year, prices have skyrocketed, and each set of clothing costs at least seven or eight yuan. If there is no real benefit, it would not be the purpose of relief. Therefore, the United Relief Association of Charitable Organizations convened a meeting the other day to discuss correcting the above-mentioned abuses. It has now been decided to implement the following unified measures for distributing cotton clothing to the poor:

Unified Distribution Measures

(1) The cotton clothing vouchers prepared by each charity organization for this distribution will be handed over to the Charity Federation for distribution at a fixed time, except for hidden poverty cases, which will still be distributed separately. Charity organizations will no longer distribute to those who come to their door or beg along the way. (2) After obtaining a clothing voucher, the poor should still collect the clothing from the charity organization that issued the voucher. (3) When the Charity Federation distributes vouchers at a fixed time, it should register the gender, name, and age of each poor person, issue a registration certificate, and ink an indelible mark on their arm. They can then be verified at the voucher issuance point and given a voucher. Those who beg for vouchers in the future will not be registered or given a voucher if they already have a mark on their arm. (4) Each charity organization should report the number of vouchers it intends to hand over to the Association for distribution at the next meeting, so that the total number can be compiled. (5) Individuals who wish to donate cotton clothing can hand them over to the Association for distribution, which is also welcome.

Resolution to Hold Winter Relief

The Shanghai Charity Organization United Relief Association held a meeting yesterday at 6 PM at the Gongdelin Restaurant on Park Road to discuss holding winter relief efforts. The chairman first reported that the Association was preparing to hold winter relief efforts, including: (1) rice distribution; (2) clothing distribution; (3) steamed bun distribution; (4) temporary shelters; and (5) relief for hidden poverty. Based on the situation last year and the current prices, an estimated 370,000 yuan is needed. It was requested to discuss which of the above five winter relief methods should be given priority to benefit the disaster victims and maintain social order. After discussion, the consensus was that the shelter was particularly important. This year's shelter will still be located on the two mu of vacant land at the Yan Family Residence provided by the Municipal Council. The cost of building the reed sheds is estimated at 5,000 yuan, and it can accommodate 1,600 to 2,000 people. The regular food and medical expenses for each person per month will cost about 15 yuan, totaling 30,000 yuan per month for 2,000 people. The operation period is scheduled for four months, totaling 120,000 yuan. At this point, the enthusiastic people attending the meeting immediately pledged or donated funds, raising over 40,000 yuan on the spot.

Increasing Number of Corpses on the Streets

Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, the number of residents in this city has surged, and due to rising prices, making a living is difficult, leading to an increasing number of corpses on the streets. According to statistics from the Municipal Council's Health Department, a total of 1,698 unclaimed corpses were discovered last month. 1,368 corpses were cremated, and 619 were buried. This also reflects the current social recession.

### Safety Week - Ends Successfully Today

The Second Safety First Movement, with the full support of the police authorities of the two concessions, has been promoted since the 18th of this month and has lasted for a week. It is officially ending today. During the period, all sectors of the city responded together, and residents conscientiously observed the rules, resulting in better results than the previous session. In addition to hoping that the residents of this city will continue to pay attention to traffic rules after the period, reduce traffic accidents, and ensure social safety, the police authorities are particularly pleased with the concerted efforts of all sectors during the period. The more than 1,000 male and female students and the entertainment industry's service propaganda have been praised by all sectors.

### Many US Defense Forces Promoted

According to the "Wah Lā Wah Lā" newspaper published yesterday morning by the US Navy's Fourth Marine Regiment, 143 soldiers of the Fourth Marine Regiment have recently been promoted. Among them, nine were promoted to the rank of sergeant or higher, 15 were promoted to sergeant, 41 were promoted to corporal, and 78 were promoted to private first class. After learning of their promotions yesterday, they were all overjoyed and congratulated each other.

### China and Burma Conclude Joint Postal Agreement; Joint Postal Station Established in Lashio, Office Established in Rangoon

According to news from the Shanghai Postal Administration, the Directorate General of Posts has now concluded a joint postal agreement with the Burmese postal authorities, and detailed measures for the international exchange of mail have also been formulated. After the establishment of this agreement, the Directorate General of Posts will immediately establish a joint postal station in Lashio and a postal transport office in Rangoon, responsible for handling mail transport matters.

### Shanghai Office of the Salt Administration Relocates Items; French Concession Police Send Detectives to Protect

The Western-style house at 201 Route Ghisi, French Concession, is the Shanghai office of the Ministry of Finance's Salt Administration. Yesterday, there was a rumor that it would be taken over by a certain party. Upon inquiry, it was learned that after the office moved west due to the war two years ago, its work had long ceased. An American named Lockehead (transliteration) and several staff members were assigned to be responsible for the safekeeping of the items there. Recently, Mr. Lockehead, the American co-manager, went to Chongqing on official business, and the office has nothing to do. Therefore, yesterday morning, it hired more than 20 cargo trucks to load all the items there and move them to another place for storage. The French Concession police received notification from the office in advance, so they sent detectives to the scene to protect it, leading to this rumor among those who did not know the truth.

### About 20 White Russian Lawyers Refuse to Appear in Court in the French Concession; Various Cases Cannot Be Prosecuted Unless the Bar Association Declares Its Position

The Shanghai Times reported that the White Russian community in Shanghai recently received an order prohibiting them from litigating in the Special No. 1 Court. However, about 20 White Russian member lawyers of the Chinese Bar Association in this city still refuse to go to the Special No. 2 Court. The Bar Association used to be located on Rue Pére Robert in the French Concession, but moved to the International Settlement after the Special No. 2 Court changed its nature. Members no longer appear in court in the French Concession. Many White Russian lawyers used to appear in the Special No. 2 Court to defend their clients, but now the Special No. 2 Court is no longer seen with these people. It is said that White Russian lawyers told many clients that unless the Bar Association declares its members' attitude towards the change in the court, all cases cannot be prosecuted.

### Shanghai Office of the China Merchants Electric Power Company Searched Yesterday; Key to the Silver Safe Taken Away; People Left to Guard the Premises

At about 11:00 AM yesterday, the temporary office of the China Merchants Electric Power Company on Route Lafayette was suddenly visited by French Concession police vehicles and vehicles with a certain party's insignia. The visitors went straight to the accounting room to inquire about the responsible personnel. However, since the former manager Lu Bohong and chairman Wang Yiting passed away one after another, there is still no responsible person in charge. The original directors and supervisors have also dispersed. According to investigation, after the fall of Nanshi, the company had long ceased to operate. However, because the Xujiahui Church district is still under the administration of the French Concession, it has to purchase electricity for distribution, hence the establishment of this office. With the French Concession's abandonment of the Church district this year, the company's business can be said to be non-existent. It had long planned to close this temporary office, but because the dozens of employees left to handle unfinished business after the layoffs had no means of livelihood, it had to be temporarily maintained. Therefore, the office really has nothing to do. Unexpectedly, there was another such action yesterday, and the staff in the office did not know what to do. Then, the visitors forced them to hand over the key to the silver safe. After opening it, they took the key away and left people to guard the premises, saying they would come again on Monday to handle it. It is found that the company is completely a commercial enterprise, which has been in existence for many years. It seems that there is no reason to impose any punishment on it, but there is such action, and it is not known what its intention is.

### 500 More American Nationals to Evacuate This Year; Returning to the US Successively on Regular Mail Ships; 1,400 American Nationals Have Already Been Evacuated from the Far East

The Shanghai Times reported that the "unnecessary" expatriate evacuation plan formulated by the US authorities in Shanghai in accordance with the State Department's order to evacuate expatriates was implemented last month and has been completed. At present, there is no plan to continue the evacuation of expatriates. However, according to authorities' estimates yesterday (the 22nd), there are still about 500 American nationals in Shanghai who will evacuate this year and return home on various regular mail ships of the American President Lines. Most of them will depart on the President Cleveland and President Coolidge. If these 500 people are included, then a total of 2,000 American nationals will be evacuated. According to the three expatriate evacuation special ships sent by the US government to the Far East, nearly 900 expatriates were taken from Shanghai, most of whom were American nationals in Shanghai. Since the US State Department issued the expatriate evacuation order, about 1,400 American nationals from all over the Far East have left the country and boarded ships, heading home one after another. Except for a small number of employees who were forced to leave by their companies, the rest all voluntarily withdrew.

### Japanese Nationals in Hongkou Taking Precautions Themselves; Cooperating to Patrol the Streets

The China Press reported that the Shanghai Mainichi Shinbun stated yesterday (the 22nd) evening that the "Self-Defense Corps" organized by Japanese in Shanghai to counter terrorist actions in Hongkou began its task of observing pedestrians last night. The corps is self-organized and aims to cooperate with the Japanese authorities to patrol the streets to maintain law and order. The observation and patrol duties of the corps members are limited to the jurisdiction of their respective road associations. Each team has three or four Japanese, and the teams are in contact with each other. If they encounter suspicious persons, they will immediately report to the Japanese army and other authorities, and sound an alarm to summon the other members to help. Alarm devices will soon be installed on each road corner for this purpose only. Only one entrance is allowed for entry and exit, with strict defense. There is also a suggestion that the red-light district where criminals gather should be moved to a certain location for surveillance. The Shanghai Times also reported that when Japanese officials entertained journalists last night, they were asked about the progress of the Japanese side's investigation after an armed Japanese military officer was shot in the Hongkou district recently. The spokesperson replied that several suspects have been arrested, but it is not known whether they are related to the recent terrorist actions.

### Post Office Investigates Newspapers and Magazines; Deadline for Submission for Review

The Shanghai Postal Administration must conduct an annual survey of registered newspapers and magazines. It is learned that the Post Office has distributed the survey forms and stipulated that the forms must be completed within 15 days and sent to the Post Office together with three issues of the latest publications for review. If no reply is received after the deadline, the registered publication will be deemed to have ceased publication. However, many newspaper offices and publishing houses have moved to new addresses without notifying the Post Office, resulting in the survey forms being undeliverable and returned. They should promptly apply to the Post Office to correct the new address to avoid being mistakenly considered as having ceased publication.

### Rumor of Relocation of Various Departments of the Post Office; Post Office Denies

Yesterday, there were rumors in the city that the Secretariat, General Affairs Section, and Personnel Section of the Shanghai Postal Administration had been scheduled to move to the second floor of the Construction Building on Jiangxi Road and Fuzhou Road on the 25th of this month for office work. Yesterday, a reporter from the New Voice News Agency inquired with the relevant departments of the Post Office. The Post Office strongly denied the relocation of the above three departments and stated that there was no such thing and it was purely unfounded. It is believed that it was a mistake regarding the relocation of the Shanghai Postal Remittance General Office on Avenue Joffre.

### Jiangsu Ship Returns to Shanghai Yesterday

The British merchant ship Jiangsu, which departed from Shanghai last month and arrived safely in Haimen, returned to Shanghai from there yesterday. This is the only foreign ship to arrive in Shanghai from the Zhejiang coastal port in the past two weeks. The ship berthed at the Bund wharf at the 16th pier. When it was about to arrive at the wharf, passengers and crew all showed joy on their faces, as they were fortunate to arrive in Shanghai. After this, the ship may temporarily berth in Shanghai, as the Zhejiang coastal port has been strictly blockaded by Japanese warships and they dare not risk sailing again.

### Residents of the Ningbo Isolation Hospital Discharged

As a result of efforts to prevent and control the Ningbo plague, it has gradually been eradicated.

### Coal Briquettes Rise in Price Again

The market price of coal briquettes has been relatively stable recently. However, in recent days, the source of raw material Hongji dross has not been as smooth as before, and stocks have become scarce. Speculators are hoarding goods, and market prices are increasing. The manufacturing cost of coal briquettes has increased slightly. After the coal market opened the day before yesterday, the market price of coal briquettes soared by 12 yuan. The factory price is now up to 152 yuan per ton, and the retail price is up to about 8 yuan per load, but it is not uniform.

### Da Sheng Ship Detained; US to Protest a Second Time; Dissatisfied with Initial Japanese Response; Second Note is Extremely Strongly Worded

The US Consul General is preparing to lodge a stronger second protest with the Japanese authorities yesterday (the 23rd) against the detention of the US ship Da Sheng EsteILeL off the coast of Zhejiang on the 2nd of this month. The US side received a reply from the Japanese side the day before yesterday (the 22nd) to the initial protest filed by the US, but a US official said the reply was "vague and unsatisfactory." It is heard that the reply stated that the ship was detained because it did not comply with the regulations of the Japanese Navy, but the US authorities do not recognize Japan's right to blockade the Chinese coast under the current circumstances. The US side will clearly state this point in the second note. The Da Sheng was detained while returning from a South China port. It is still in the hands of the Japanese Navy, and there is no news of when it will be released. The Da Sheng was once detained by the Japanese off the coast of Zhejiang this year and was released after two weeks.

No News Since Detention

The Shanghai Times reported that the US consulate authorities confirmed yesterday (the 22nd) that the US ship Da Sheng EstelleL is still being detained by the Japanese authorities. The US consul lodged a protest with the Japanese authorities because the ship was detained and received a reply, but did not receive a satisfactory explanation, nor was it able to learn the details. The Da Sheng motor ship was detained by the Japanese authorities off the coast of Zhejiang on the 2nd of this month while returning. Although the ship was equipped with radio, Shanghai has not received any telegrams from it. The passengers on board the ship when it was detained have already transferred to other ships and arrived in Shanghai. Four months ago, the Da Sheng was once detained by the Japanese authorities and released two days later.

### Teachers and Students of Zhejiang University Mourn Zhu Hua Yesterday; Solemn and Tragic Ceremony; Works to Be Permanently Preserved

Zhu Hua, a third-year student of the Department of Architecture at Zhejiang University and the son of General Zhu Shaolan, died after being shot by French Concession police. People from all walks of life were deeply indignant. His family has hired a French lawyer to file a lawsuit against the French Concession authorities. People in Shanghai are waiting for news of a satisfactory resolution from the French side to appease the public. The teachers and students of the school deeply mourn Zhu Hua because he was excellent in character and learning and was not far from graduation. Therefore, a memorial service was held at 4:15 PM yesterday at the church at 320 Nanjing Road, Cishu Building. The arrangement of the meeting place was simple and solemn. A portrait of Zhu Hua was hung in the center, looking vivid and lifelike. The walls around were full of elegiac couplets presented by his teachers, friends, and classmates. Zhu Hua's architectural design works were also hung for exhibition, a dazzling array. His talents were not fully developed, and he died suddenly, which is very regrettable. All the teachers and students of the Department of Architecture of the school attended in person. Representatives from other schools also attended. The number of people attending was no less than 200. The memorial service was extremely simple. First, everyone stood in silence and bowed to the portrait to pay their respects, presented wreaths, and recited the memorial text. Then, representatives of teachers and students gave speeches, expressing their condolences for Zhu Hua's tragic death. Then, Zhu Shu, Zhu Hua's brother, gave a speech on behalf of his family and reported on the circumstances of the incident when the police caused the disaster. Tears flowed with his voice, and the teachers and students attending the meeting also sighed with tears. The meeting ended at about 5:00 PM. It is heard that the teachers and students of the school will find a way to preserve Zhu Hua's life's work as a permanent memorial.

Although they are still in the factory, they are unwilling to do any work. Everyone is sitting idly on the benches. It is heard that the reason for this strike is due to dissatisfaction with the company's profit-sharing system. According to them, the distribution of the company's profits is not fair to some employees. The tram company authorities refused to discuss this matter.

### Kidnapping Case Occurs on Sichuan Road; Cheng Wangsheng Abducted; Shanghai Bank Manager Hu Tingchen Also Kidnapped

A kidnapping case occurred on Sichuan Road in the Public Concession at 9:30 AM yesterday. The kidnapped man was Cheng Wangsheng, a senior employee of a dyeing company. Cheng Wangsheng, 57 years old, from Wuxi, lives at 23 Pushicun, Rue Bourgeat, French Concession. He is currently a senior executive at a textile printing and dyeing company on Sichuan Road. At 9:30 AM yesterday, Tang Weiwun, the son of Tang Dianzhen, a fellow villager and manager of the company, came to visit. They left together. Cheng then boarded Tang's private car No. 7564 and went to the company together, driven by the driver Zhu Guopei from Yangzhou. When the car arrived on Sichuan Road, Cheng and Tang were getting out of the car to enter the lane when suddenly three ambushers in long gowns kidnapped Cheng. The three bandits each produced a pistol and held Cheng hostage on the left and right, boarded the bandit car, and sped away. When the concierge at the scene discovered this, the car had already disappeared. When the car left, Tang Weiwun, who was in the same car, hid in the neighboring area due to his agility, so he was not discovered by the bandits. The case is currently under strict investigation by the police.

Bank Manager Kidnapped in Front of His Residence

At about 9:00 AM yesterday, a kidnapping case occurred in front of No. 60, Lane 698, Yuyuan Road, Huxi. The kidnapped person was the owner of the house, Hu Tingchen, courtesy name Wenfu (53 years old this year), from Yuyao, Zhejiang. Hu is the manager of Shanghai Bank at 327 Jiangxi Road. At that time, he was walking out of his house and getting into his private car to go to the bank for office work. Unexpectedly, three bandits were already ambushing by the roadside. Seeing Hu coming out, they rushed forward, took out pistols, and threatened Hu and the chartered driver. The three bandits then forced Hu onto a black-licensed car No. 4606 parked at the corner of Route Amiral Courbet and sped away, disappearing without a trace. Afterwards, Hu's family reported the situation to the Jing'an Temple police station and requested a search. It is heard that the bandit car number 4606 was forged.

### Kidnappers of Xu Shuliang Sentenced

Xu Shuliang, the owner of the Shanghai Wool Weaving Factory on Route Pére Robert, a native of Ningbo, lived at 77 Yugucun, Yuyuan Road, Huxi. On the 18th of last month, several bandits suddenly broke in with weapons and robbed property, and took Xu away before leaving, hiding him at No. 18, Fahua Town, and writing to Xu's family, intending to demand a ransom of 200,000 yuan. Later, the Jing'an Temple police station's Chinese detective Tang Jian and detective Ni Jiafeng arrested eight kidnappers, including Li Ruitang, at the Nanjing Hotel on Route Cardinal Mercier, and rescued the hostage Xu Shuliang and sent him to the First Special Court.

### 笑匠卓別林主演　「大獨裁者」中的笑料（二）
Chaplin the Comedian Stars in "The Great Dictator": Comedy Highlights (Part 2)

At this moment, the dictator is riding high with ambition, and he opens his mouth to borrow money from a famous Jewish banker in order to invade Austerlitz. The Jewish millionaire refuses his request, so the dictator flies into a rage and vents his anger on the Jews. An aide, Schultz, sympathizes with the Jews and is sentenced to a concentration camp for training. The barber is also sent to the camp. Fortunately, the two are quick-witted and eventually escape together.

Not only do the dictator and the barber have the same name, Hynkel, but they also look alike, making it difficult to distinguish them. After escaping from the concentration camp by impersonating a stormtrooper officer, the barber goes through many dangers and is forced to disguise himself as a duck hunter, hiding in the fields and waters to avoid attention. However, at this time, the dictator suddenly disappears, and government officials are very anxious, sending out scouts to search for him. The barber accidentally falls into the water while hunting ducks and is caught by the guards. Because he looks so much like the dictator, he is unexpectedly and forcibly identified as their leader and escorted into the palace.

Hynkel is terrified and speechless, with no way to defend himself, so he has no choice but to go along with the mistake. Thus, this Jewish barber, who once suffered from shock in battle and became neurally deranged, unable to speak, inadvertently becomes the dictator of Tomania. From then on, the charade becomes reality, causing much chaos. Coincidentally, the dictator Napaloni (played by Jack Oakie) from another country comes to visit, and the two meeting together produces even more jokes.

Finally, the fake dictator, barber Hynkel, attends a grand rally, with countless listeners standing below the stage. At first, he hesitates, staring blankly, not knowing what to say. Later, he suddenly gains courage and shouts loudly, completely overturning all the policies of the real dictator, leaving everything clean and clear. Revolution... revolution, the whole play ends. Isn't this a great joke?

Chaplin plays two roles in the play, both the real and fake dictators are played by him alone. He is best at performing awkward, in-between movements. When he plays a small soldier, a barber, and then becomes a fake dictator, that acting skill completely maintains the humorous style of the old comedian. We can well imagine the sorrow, pain, humbleness, and tearful appeals of the character he portrays, the kind of comical love songs. In playing the real dictator, he transforms into an arrogant, conceited, quick-tempered, and capricious standard tyrant, and his performance has its own unique charm. His extraordinary intelligence is naturally admirable.

Chaplin, who never speaks in his plays, breaks the taboo this time. (In "City Lights," he did open his mouth, but it was only sound, not meaningful speech.) He initially plays a small soldier who is overly frightened and returns home from the war. He's confused, can't speak properly, and uses many small movements to show his inner distress and sorrow. Later, he gradually regains his ability to make sounds, say single words, and finally recovers his ability to speak. Surprise and joy intertwine, and he gestures wildly. Throughout this process, he brings out all his signature skills, which is his consistently most skilled acting. The places that make people laugh until their stomachs hurt are precisely these.

Jack Oakie, with his imposing appearance, plays another dictator, Napaloni, so vividly that he almost becomes the real thing. When he performs, he raises his head, nods slightly, puckers his lips, and looks down disdainfully. He tucks his right arm into his waist, and clenches his left fist outward. Anyone who watches international news and pays attention to current affairs photos will know who this gentleman is at a glance!

Paulette Goddard plays a little Jewish girl, Hannah, slender and graceful, lively and lovely. Although the little Jew is neurally deranged, his humanity has not been lost. Seeing this beautiful neighbor, he cannot help but develop a romantic interest. In the painful environment where the dictator orders the expulsion of the Jews, it creates a romance between the two of them. A good couple, the charade becomes reality, and the performance is joyful but not lewd. Chaplin must be laughing in his belly!

In Chaplin's "The Great Dictator," the country of Tomania, ruled by the dictator, has a national emblem of "××" -- two crossed flowers. The meaning of this can only be explained by the Shanghai slang "tripping over the threshold" or "dropping the spear flower." If the meaning of the national emblem is like this, then everything else goes without saying! It is truly a credit to Chaplin's imagination.

The opening scene of this film is very grand, showing scenes of the last European war on the screen. Barren trees and desolate forests, scorched earth and broken walls, the roar of cannons, the flying of bullets, the smoke and mist of gunpowder, and the glint of blades and shadows of blood send the viewer straight to No Man's Land -- the battlefield. When filming this large scene, the camera was running for 425 feet, which is an unprecedented long shot in the history of film production. Mr. Chaplin's pioneering spirit is truly magnificent.

But after this shot, the source of laughter begins:

From the trenches, we see that small Jewish man, Hynkel, with his tightly furrowed brow, half-crying, half-laughing, a small mustache on his nose, and two thick eyebrows that are very close together, almost meeting. He has a steel helmet on his head, an armed belt around his body, and a large, gourd-like hand grenade hanging from it. When we look at the face of this "comrade," we know that he is in the trenches, but his heart is at home, and he is reluctantly coping in a daze.

The Tomanian army has newly built a cannon that is unprecedented in history, ready to bombard the enemy's position, and the important responsibility of firing this cannon is entrusted to the small soldier Hynkel. Of course, because the cannon is newly made, there is no way to grasp its "temper." Besides Chaplin's Hynkel, who else would shoulder this matter? So, with a loud bang, the cannonball actually shot out of the muzzle.

(Top) Hynkel returns home from the front line suffering from shock, with complete memory loss; coupled with the dictator's rule, life is difficult, and he is in a very difficult situation. (Bottom) Hynkel (played by Chaplin on the left) and Napaloni (played by Jack Oakie on the right) ride in the same car.

### 中棉公司控中和公司　判令賠償損失　兩造辯論各執一詞　事實明瞭定期宣判
China Cotton Company Sues Zhonghe Company, Ordered to Pay Compensation for Losses; Both Parties Debate, Each Holding Their Own View; Facts Clear, Sentence Scheduled

The China Cotton Company, with a capital of ten million, has branches or offices in various places. In 1937, the company entrusted the Zhonghe Transportation Company to transport cotton yarn and cotton cloth to Kunming. In that year, 140 pieces of cotton yarn and cotton cloth were delivered to Zhonghe Company, with the understanding that they would be transported by the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway to the China Cotton Company's Kunming office. However, Zhonghe Company delayed the transportation and subsequently changed the route of the cotton yarn and cotton cloth through Bian Shui, delivering only four pieces to Kunming. The remaining 136 pieces of cotton yarn and cotton cloth were stranded in Bian Shui and were completely burned in a fire on March 29 of this year. The China Cotton Company repeatedly requested compensation for losses from Zhonghe Company, but Zhonghe Company failed to provide a satisfactory response. Therefore, the China Cotton Company, believing that Zhonghe Company delayed transportation, changed the route without authorization, and failed to pay attention to safety, resulting in the burning of cotton yarn and cotton cloth worth more than 200,000 yuan, commissioned lawyer Wang Zanxi to file a lawsuit in the civil division of the First Special District Court, accusing Zhonghe Transportation Company and requesting a judgment ordering compensation for losses of 146,760 yuan in national currency. After deducting the transportation fees of 36,097 yuan that Zhonghe Company had paid on behalf of the plaintiff, the defendant should still compensate the plaintiff 210,662 yuan and 1 jiao and 9 fen in national currency. Yesterday afternoon at around 3 p.m., the court, based on the complaint, launched a hearing in the Second Civil Court presided over by Mo Runhua. The legal representative of the defendant, Zhonghe Transportation Company, Zhang Ruizhi, did not appear in person, but appointed a lawyer to represent the company in court. In addition to defending the original lawsuit, the company also filed a counterclaim, requesting a judgment ordering the counterclaim defendant, China Cotton Company, to pay the counterclaim plaintiff transportation fees of 26,097 yuan in national currency (i.e., 7,309 yuan and 8 jiao and 1 fen in Vietnamese currency). After Judge Mo took the bench, he questioned both parties at length. The China Cotton Company side detailed Zhonghe Company's delay in transportation and failure to pay attention to safety, resulting in the fire, stating that the negligence was entirely on the part of Zhonghe Company, and therefore requested a judgment ordering Zhonghe Company to bear the responsibility for compensation for losses. However, the Zhonghe Company side firmly claimed that due to the Sino-Japanese War, the freight transportation on the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway was often obstructed, and the change of route to Bian Shui was also with the consent of the China Cotton Company's staff. Zhonghe Company did not intentionally delay transportation or act negligently. As for the burning of 136 pieces of cotton yarn and cotton cloth, the insurance company should be responsible. The court verified the statements and ordered both parties to debate. Although both parties held their own views, the court considered the facts to be clear and immediately announced the closing of the hearing, scheduling the pronouncement of the sentence for 10 a.m. on November 28.

### 滇緬路的意義
The Significance of the Burma Road

Since our country opened the Burma Road, the attitudes of Britain and the United States towards the Far East situation have become more consistent. The New York Times published an article discussing the significance of the Burma Road's opening and its transportation situation, which is quite pertinent. Therefore, I have translated it as follows:

If the Burma Road is only regarded as a highway, it has no great significance. The road is only one section of the road from the end of the Burmese railway to the upper reaches of the Yangtze River in the Chinese hinterland. If the weather is good, the 715-mile journey from Lashio to Kunming takes six days for a transport vehicle. In the smoothest transport, there can only be 100 transport vehicles with a load of two tons per day. Traveling unhindered. Compared with the US transport, just four freight cars can transport all the goods loaded by these transport vehicles. But the Burma Road is not just a road but a symbol. When Britain announced the opening of this road, the first thing China thought of was not only the convenience of transportation, but that it was a link with the outside world.

Before the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, part of this long road was already under construction. However, the most important link, the Burma Road itself, the mountainous Kunming-Lashio section, did not begin construction until late autumn of 1937. The entire project can be said to have been built by mountain people who had never seen a wheeled vehicle. Apart from crude hoes and hammers, there were no other tools. At the most intense point of the project, nearly one million people were working on it. A year after work began, vehicles were traveling on the road.

The area through which this road passes is full of towering mountains and strange and dangerous landscapes. Mountain ridges rise to over 10,000 feet, and the rocky valleys between the plateaus are thousands of feet below sea level. The area is sparsely populated and unusually remote. However, Marco Polo passed through this road when he entered China from the Western Regions in the 13th century; it was already an ancient road at that time. In recent times, mule trains transporting raw silk from the upper reaches of the Yangtze River through Burma also take this route. However, the road taken by mules and horses cannot be used by vehicles. Often, the steep mountain roads are built with stone steps, and the mule teams climb up these steps, and cross rivers from the swaying iron cable bridges. Because of inadequate protection from wind and rain, they are often buried by collapsing mountain soil.

After the Japanese military blockaded China's ports, China sought new international transportation routes, and engineers built the Burma Road in this remote area. The workers used were all conscripted from villages hundreds of miles away. Both men and women came to help. They used their hands to clear the route along the mountains, and carried stones for paving the road in willow baskets from several miles away, and used hand-hewn bluestone rollers to flatten the roadbed. These workers came from remote villages, and they lived in the wild fields among the thickets, sleeping in the open air for weeks in the shivering climate. In the areas with heavy miasma, when workers were infected with deadly malaria, thousands died from this disease.

In the 700-mile-long road, there are only four large towns, the largest of which has 25,000 residents. The situation has now changed, and new towns, new industries, airfields, armories, and factories have been formed one after another. In the years to come, everyone believes that this area will become an industrial center, and the Burma Road will become a major trade route. The area is rich in minerals, and agriculture is also very developed in some places.

As far as the current situation is concerned, no matter what, this road is always China's lifeline, as important as the Great Wall of China. Now there are tens of thousands of workers engaged in road repairs, rebuilding roadbeds, leveling slopes, and straightening curves. No less than 75,000 people are dedicated to building roads so that the soil surface will not collapse and hinder transportation due to rainwater erosion.

From east to west, Chinese travelers to Burma often depart from Kunming, the capital of Yunnan Province. Before the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, Kunming was still an old eastern city. Kunming is located on the shores of Dianchi Lake, which is 40 miles long. Fertile rice fields on the plateau are planted with cypresses along the canal. Today, Kunming has several arsenals, and all the former decadent atmosphere has been swept away.

Departing from Kunming, the road gradually rises, reaching Lufeng, a small walled city located at the mouth of a gorge. From here westward, the arduous engineering work of building the road begins. Because the highway, at this point, rises along the cliff for forty miles to the rock face. At the top of this valley is a high and densely forested hill, which is the watershed between the Yangtze River and the Red River. Several years ago, there were many bandits here. Several miles of highway are built around the top of the mountain, about nine thousand feet above sea level: then it winds down to Chuxiong, where there are many places where the road has collapsed, making travel difficult on rainy days. There is an airfield and aviation school there.

Two hundred miles further west, no traces of humans can be seen, reaching Xiaguan. The middle must pass through four high mountain roads and several large rivers and deep valleys. If you travel on this section, you may not see a house in fifty miles. But along the way there are two villages that are gradually attracting attention: Yunnan Yi, where there is a machine field. And Qinghuadong, a natural bluestone mountain stream, said to be able to resist bombs, and is now built as an armory. Xiaguan is surrounded by towering mountains, with snow that does not melt, and is a natural fortress, crouching like a tiger and coiling like a dragon, which is very dangerous. There is a beautiful lake there, and Dali on the edge of the lake produces Yunnan's famous. Other valleys, the scenery is excellent.

From Xiaguan to Burma, there are 280 miles, which is one of the most difficult sections of the road construction project. The mountains are higher, more rugged, the valleys are deeper, and the rainfall is even heavier. The snow line is lower than anywhere else along the way. There are also the Mekong River and the Salween River in between. Several mountain ridges often have twelve to fourteen sharp turns that come one after another. Landslides are commonplace, and large stone bridges often have to be built when building roads. Tropical diseases and malaria are rampant in the valley areas. If it were not for the pressure of the war of aggression and the struggle for survival, China would never have built a road in this area. This is truly a very difficult task.

### 軍用新聞名詞詮釋（五）
Explanation of Military News Terms (5)

Q-Boat: Mystery ship. The British Admiralty places ships of unknown nature in the "Q" category, hence the name. During the last World War, Q-Boats often pretended to be drifting ships to lure submarines into the range of their concealed guns, which then attacked them.

Reconnaissance: Aircraft or infantry scouting enemy positions.

Shrapnel: Shell containing a charge to burst it and scatter a shower of bullets; invented by British artillery officer Henry Shrapnel (1761-1842). A typical shrapnel shell contains 300 bullets, and each bullet can wound or kill people and animals within 400 yards of the explosion.

Skua: British dive bomber. Skua is the name of a type of gull that lives on the European coast. These aircraft are carried by aircraft carriers and often take off to patrol the sea, hence the name. It can carry two people and is a monoplane with a single engine and a controllable, three-bladed propeller. Details of its weaponry have not been announced. The maximum speed in level flight is 225 miles per hour.

Spitfire: British monoplane fighter, equipped with multiple machine guns, suitable for combat day and night. Each wing is equipped with four Browning machine guns. The maximum speed is 367 miles per hour. It can climb 11,000 feet in 4.8 minutes. The pilot sits halfway down the V-shaped nose.

Stick: To drop bombs continuously, in a straight line, through a bombing target at uniform intervals.

Strafe: From the German word for "punish." In military terms, it means to use cannons or aircraft to strafe with machine guns.

Stuka: German dive bomber. Usually refers to the Junkers Ju 87, which can seat two people and has a single engine. There are two machine guns on the wings and one in the machine room in the tail. The maximum speed in level flight is 240 miles per hour. The maximum dive speed, without brakes, is 430 miles per hour. An improved version of the Junkers Ju 87 is the Junkers Ju 88, which is equipped with two engines and has a known speed of 320 miles per hour. The word Stuka is a combination of the German words Sturz (dive) and Kampf (combat). Therefore, a Stuka bomber is actually a dive bomber.

Children's Weekly

### 自問一下
Ask Yourself

--- Xin Fang

The season has turned to early winter. Children are adding layers of brightly colored woolen clothes, but the refugee children by the telephone poles are still wearing clothes that don't keep them warm, enduring the western wind and struggling with life! Children! Let us ask ourselves, why is there such a difference?

Children from rich families eat well and dress well, but they are unwilling to study hard. Children from poor families, although they cannot eat and dress up to par, are willing to study hard. Children! Should we envy the former or follow the latter?

Being a good student in school is the only way to become a good citizen in society. Children, let us ask ourselves, what qualities should a good student possess? Don't forget that you need to add new qualities that meet the needs of the times.

A scholar once said, "Reading must have a spirit of not being careless in the slightest and a basis for everything. One must always raise questions and pursue every question to the end." He also said, "Reading is not limited to a specific place, and one can read anytime, anywhere. Using leisure time to read is the most meaningful!" Children, do you have this spirit and habit of reading?

### Digestion

— Jin Zhen

During the last class in the morning at school, the hunger in every student's stomach seemed to burn fiercely, probably not even the teacher was an exception. Ah Hui's buttocks seemed to have grown thorns, making him very restless, constantly moving his feet, and his energy was exhausted. He listened to the teacher's words listlessly, not hearing a single word, but paying close attention to the bell for the end of class. Quietly waiting, waiting... Time passed second by second. Finally, the hour and minute hands on the clock overlapped at the number twelve, and the bell rang for a while. Ah Hui ran home, taking three steps at a time. Fortunately, his home was not far from the school, so he arrived home within ten minutes.

The meal at home was already cooked, and Ah Hui could eat as soon as he got home. At this time, he just kept shoving the rice into his mouth, without chewing it carefully. Therefore, a bowl of rice was empty in no time. He ate three bowls in this way, his originally empty stomach was filled, with the rice and dishes piled inside, waiting to be digested. Unexpectedly, he didn't have time to digest it all at once, and he felt a stuffy bloating. He asked his mother to give him some digestive medicine. When his older brother found out about this, he rebuked him, saying: "Who told you to eat so fast? You have to chew your food carefully. How can you digest it easily if you gobble it down like that?"

"Brother, why does chewing finely help digestion?"

"Okay, let me tell you some common sense about digestion! After we put the rice and vegetables into our mouths, we must chew them finely and chew the rice with saliva. Then there will be some sweetness. You should know that saliva is the first tool for digestion, turning part of the rice into sugars. If you chew it finer, this effect will become faster, which can reduce the work of the stomach. Once food enters the stomach, the stomach's job is to digest protein and absorb the digested nutrients into the blood vessels through the stomach wall. The intestines change the starch in the rice and various nutrients such as protein and fat in other foods, and send them to the blood through the capillaries on the intestinal wall. Undigested food goes from the small intestine to the large intestine, and finally excreted out of the body. The food eaten at ten o'clock at noon is completely digested three or four hours later, so after eating, you should not do excessively strenuous exercise, otherwise, your stomach will be full of food, and if you shake it again, it will be very dangerous. The purpose of digestion is to turn solid food into liquid before it reaches the blood. When food passes through the digestive system, it becomes easy for the body to absorb. Digestive juices are a very important machine in this process, because digestive juices are secreted by the stomach and intestines, dissolving the easily soluble foods, and for those that are not easily soluble, digestive juices will cause chemical reactions to dissolve them as much as possible, making it easier for the stomach and intestines to absorb. If you eat too fast, causing the stomach to work too hard, there is a risk of developing stomach problems, which is a very difficult disease to cure."

### The Lion and the Mosquito

— Lao She

The lion is the king of beasts. It can be said that no animal in the world is not afraid of him. However, no one would have thought that there would be a small mosquito who was not only not afraid of him, but also won a victory. The story is like this:

One day, the little mosquito flew to the lion and said, "Hey, Lion! Do you think you are the king of beasts? You rely on your claws and teeth to bully weak animals, which is nothing. They are all afraid of you, but I still want to compete with you."

The little mosquito started to sting the lion's face. The lion was furious and slapped his face hard with his paw. The little mosquito was very naughty, stinging here and then flying there to sting again. The lion slapped his face until it was covered in blood and cried in pain.

"Buzz buzz! Buzz buzz! You are such a big thing, but you were defeated by my little self! Victory! Victory!"

The little mosquito flew away triumphantly, singing a song of victory.

### Shirley Temple's Autobiography (23)

— Min

But the best time of my life was last year when I went to Honolulu, Hawaii with my mom and dad for the summer. Gosh, it was so much fun. You can't imagine how far across the ocean you have to travel before you finally see Honolulu. At first, we thought we would be in the ocean forever and never arrive.

This trip was my dad's idea. I can't remember when he started talking about it, but it was probably several months before we left. He said to me, "After your movie 'Just Around the Corner' is finished, let's go on a trip." I quickly said: "Dad, shouldn't we wait until you have time off from the bank?" What I meant was that it would be best if everyone had time off, so it wouldn't interfere with work.

At first, Mom wasn't sure if I could go on this long trip because she was afraid I would get seasick. Gosh, you know, seasickness is the most uncomfortable illness. I knew that if I took a ship out to sea, I would inevitably get seasick. Before, because I had never been seasick, I didn't know what it was like. Before we left, I said to my mother: "If I feel uncomfortable, I'll turn around and go home right away." Mom smiled and said, "Honey, it's not that easy. You can't ask the ship to turn around just because you feel sick!"

Gosh, do you understand? The captain of the ship certainly can't change his itinerary just because a little girl is seasick.

Finally, we decided to go on the trip. Oh my, we were so busy! Mom had to start making clothes. I had to rush to the dentist to have my teeth checked in case I had any dental problems on the way. Dad was figuring out if all our suitcases and luggage were enough to hold all our clothes.

Finally, I also had to say goodbye to my friends on the studio lot. When I met Mr. Bill Robinson, he said quickly: "Shirley, when you go out this time, don't forget all your dance steps. When you come back, I'll teach you some new dances." Later, he did keep his word. The new dance steps in my latest film "The Little Rebel" were taught by Mr. Robinson.

I then went to the rabbit hutch behind the bungalow to say goodbye to my rabbits, watching them with mournful expressions, as if they wanted to go with me. But in fact, it was impossible, because there wasn't enough space on the ship to accommodate them. All I could take was a beloved doll. Gosh, I love you the most, but I can't take you with me.

We had so much fun on the ship! You can't imagine how much water there was all around us. Every day we played all kinds of games on the deck. What I loved the most were those horses. Of course, these weren't real horses; they were all made of wood. The sailors pushed them back and forth. They would also let me push them, but it was very tiring to push them.

One day, I went to the captain's office and helped him steer the wheel. Dad called me "Captain Shirley" and often saluted me, saying: "Aye, aye, sir!" That's what they say on the ship. "Aye aye" means "yes yes."

### Elementary School Student Summer Homework Competition, Advanced Fourth Place: A Meaningful Thing During the Summer Vacation

— Nanping Elementary School, Wu Zhongqing

Whenever I pass by on any road, I always see those ragged, sallow-faced homeless children, pitifully following behind pedestrians, begging for money to fill their stomachs. If they meet some kind people, they can get some money or some food; but when they meet those heartless people, not only do they not get any money, but they also get cursed, making them feel even more pain and disappointment.

The day before yesterday, my younger brother and I were walking home from school when we passed Herd Road. Suddenly, my younger brother said to me, "Sister, look over there!" He pointed his hand towards the open space in front of us. "Hmm! What is it?" I asked him. I looked forward and, indeed, there were many people standing there. This immediately aroused my curiosity, and I walked forward. I saw that there was a crowd of people, and in the middle, there were words written in chalk on the ground. Beside the words knelt a ragged, sallow-faced child, staring at the crowd with wide eyes, tears streaming down his face, not saying a word, as if asking for help. Everyone was looking at the white words on the ground. These words were probably written by this child! Inside were the words of his suffering: "Unfortunate little one, surnamed Wang, named Yu, fifteen years old this year. Due to the war, I lost my parents, brothers, and sisters. Now I am wandering the streets, hungry, eating wind and sleeping in the open..." After reading it, I felt sorry for him and had a feeling: Was he the only one left in his family? He is also someone's good child, also one of the little masters of China, but why does he have to suffer such pain? The words he wrote were upright and neat, and the sentences were clear and refreshing. These really made me admire and envy him, but I felt ashamed because I had the opportunity to study, but why was I unwilling to work hard? It seemed to give me a lesson, telling me to work hard to catch up. There are many people like this. We happy people must find a way to help them!

Before I left this child, I gave him the money I had for the bus. He said, "Thank you, thank you." Ah! How pitiful!

### Xun Huisheng Opens a Hotel in the Old Capital

— Zhi Su

He Invests Solely in Founding the Liuxiang Hotel, with His Son, Lingxiang, Serving as Supervisor

Xun Huisheng, one of the Four Great Dan Performers, has not been to Shanghai for many years. Not long ago, both the Golden and New theaters invited him. Huisheng seemed to have agreed to both, but he didn't come. The reason why he didn't come has only become clear now. It turns out that he was not complaining about the small payment, nor was he afraid of the hardship of traveling, but that he was opening a hotel in Beiping, and the building was already under construction. He had to stay in Beiping to oversee everything, so he could not come south for the time being.

The hotel founded by Xun Huisheng is not a restaurant for people to fill their stomachs, but a hotel, like the hotels in Shanghai. Xun Huisheng's alias is Master Xiaoliuxiang, and his hotel is named "Liuxiang Hotel", located on Li Tiegui Slant Street, with more than seventy rooms, all new equipment, water heating and air conditioning. The building is quite grand. His son Xun Lingxiang is supervising the work every day, saying that it can catch up with the opening before the Lunar New Year. Xun Huisheng has hired Jiang Mingquan to serve as manager.

This "Liuxiang Hotel" was founded solely by Xun Huisheng. Now he is busy inviting several famous scholars to write inscriptions. It seems that Xun Huisheng is already preparing to give up his old profession, and the establishment of this hotel is undoubtedly a step in preparation for changing careers in a few years.

### Huang Zongzhan Says: The Seven Male Stars I Admire Most

— Jia Li

Hollywood's only Chinese cinematographer, Mr. Huang Zongzhan, is recognized as one of Hollywood's top ten cinematographers. His works include "Secrets of the Louvre", "Cape Fear" and the recent "Possessed". Mr. Huang often collaborates with famous directors. Once, when he met a reporter from "Hollywood" magazine who asked him which actors he thought were worthy of being called geniuses, Mr. Huang only pointed out seven Hollywood male actors, saying that they were worthy of admiration and had very good talent.

First is Lionel Barrymore, who played the role of the grandfather in "You Can't Take It With You" and the old doctor in "Young Dr. Kildare". His characteristic is paying close attention to small movements.

Second is Wallace Beery, whose famous works include "Viva Villa!", "The Champ", and "Tugboat Annie". His style is rough and delicate.

Third is Charles Laughton, whose works include "The Private Life of Henry VIII", "Les Misérables", "The Hunchback of Notre Dame" and "Mutiny on the Bounty". His style is crisp and realistic, and his eye expressions are extremely refined and sophisticated.

Fourth is Akim Tamiroff, who made a deep impression on people in "The General Died at Dawn", "Stagecoach" and "The Story of Dr. Wassell". He has a talent for acting, but he is always relegated to supporting roles.

Fifth is John Carradine, who partnered with Edward G. Robinson in "Mary Burns, Fugitive", playing a prisoner who specialized in joking, and played a preacher in "The Grapes of Wrath". His expressions are full of emotion, and his personality is very typical.

Sixth is Henry Fonda, whose works include "Young Mr. Lincoln", "Jesse James" and "The Grapes of Wrath". His style is characterized by calmness and depth, but sometimes it is too formulaic, and his artistic cultivation is very rich.

Seventh is Clark Gable, who acts with vitality, lively and moving, but sometimes he is too excessive and frivolous.

### Snippets from the Chrysanthemum Scene

The year before last, Xiao Cuihua played a coffin scene in the old capital, with Gao Fuyuan playing the paper boy in "Two Hundred and Fifty". Zhan Shifu, Gao's disciple, was supposed to keep Gao from laughing out loud during the performance. Zhan played a trick, using a fly swatter to tickle Gao's nostrils. Gao was unbearably itchy at the time, almost causing a joke. After the performance, he blamed Zhan, saying: "If I, this two hundred and fifty, didn't have some skill, I would have been embarrassed!" Zhan laughed and thanked him, making Gao somewhat confused.

Once, Xin Yanqiu was performing Yutangchun, with Zhu Binxian playing the escort. Zhu's brother, Wang Zixiang, was the musician. When Su San wanted to worship the escort as her godfather, Zhu repeatedly waved his hands, looking at Wang Zixiang and winking, saying: "Don't rush! Ask your brother if he is willing first!" The audience roared with laughter, and Yanqiu couldn't help but smile.

In the second year of the Republic, Mei Wan-hua performed at the Guangde Theater in the old capital. On that day, famous actors gathered. The fifth act of the program was Wuhua Cave by Yu Xiushan, Wang Fengqing, Mei Lanfang, and Wang Huifang, determined to be Xiaogan Da by Gong Yunfu and Wu Caixia; Huanghelou by Liu Hongsheng, De Junru, Huang Runfu, Rui Debao, and Liu Jingran; Yanmenguan by Wang Yaoqing, Lu Yushan, and Jin Zhongren; Daoganzongjuan by Lao Tan, and Huijiabao by Yang Xiaolou, Yan Lanqiu, Wang Changlin, Qian Jinfu, Li Lianzhong, and Xu Deyi. Unexpectedly, Wuhua Cave was posted but not performed. After the Huanghelou act, the audience rioted, shouting for refunds. Some even yelled like dogs, "We came to see Mei Lanfang and Wang Huifang!" The theater had no choice but to add a complete Rainbow Pass after Lao Tan finished Daoganzongjuan, and the uproar subsided. Wan-hua's performance after Lao Tan's play was the only time it ever happened, and all the famous actors that day, regardless of their roles, were typical characters, but they were no match for the magic of Mei and Wang. It was also a strange thing in the opera world.

Jin Shaoshan had the problem of not being able to sing when he was hungry. One year, he performed Famen Temple in Shanghai and arrived very late, not having had dinner. He hurriedly dressed up and went on stage. His attendants knew his problem well, so they prepared oxtail soup and bread for him to eat after Liu Jin finished his incense offering and came off stage. Unexpectedly, the soup was too hot and he could not eat it when he was supposed to. When he went on stage for the second time, Shaoshan was very hungry. He sat next to the Empress Dowager, looking extremely embarrassed. So he ordered his attendants to bring up the oxtail soup and bread and ate and drank it heartily on the stage. This was an innovation.

The disciples of the Fu Liancheng Opera School are ranked in order of Xi, Lian, Fu, Sheng, Shi, and Yuan. Those who are hired to come to Shanghai are all elites from the Fu, Sheng, Shi, and Yuan classes. Few people in Shanghai know the rankings below Yuan. It is said that they have been set as Yun, Qing, Fu, Lai, and Yun.

The Hawthorne Case

### The Dancer's Homecoming

— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter 11 Zhao Boxiong's Confession

At this time, I raised the second important question. "Then, who hit Li Zhifan himself at that moment?"

Hawthorne suddenly sat up straight from the sofa, casually threw away his cigarette butt, shook his head and said, "This is another new chapter, and I am not sure yet. But –" He stopped talking and immediately stood up and paced around the room.

I also threw my cigarette butt into the ashtray and continued to ask, "Hawthorne, why don't you say it? But what?"

Hawthorne lowered his head and said slowly, "I have an idea, but it's too vague." He paused again and changed his tone, saying, "I believe this move won't be too difficult. I had Nijing Shou send two people to guard outside this house long ago, one named Songquan and one named Hesheng. When I went to Lili's house at four o'clock, I only saw Hesheng outside. That Songquan clearly followed Li Zhifan. If Songquan wasn't derelict in his duty, he should have seen everything that happened. We just found out that Songquan also had a message to go to the hall. I think I'll make a phone call to ask Nijing Shou. This new chapter can also be explained."

Just as Hawthorne was walking to the phone, the phone suddenly rang first. Hawthorne picked up the phone and listened. It was from Jiu'an Hospital. The caller was Nijing Shou. However, Hawthorne had no chance to ask about Songquan's report, because according to Nijing Shou, Li Zhifan's condition changed after the bullet was removed, and he was now on the verge of death, asking us to go immediately.
