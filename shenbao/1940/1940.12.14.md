### Italian Military Setbacks Shake the Axis Alliance, Impacting the European and Far Eastern Situations; Bloody Purge Brewing in Rome

London, Reuters Diplomatic Correspondent reports: The crushing defeat inflicted by British forces on Mussolini's troops in North Africa will likely decide the war's future. The Italian fleet must now sail out for a decisive battle; otherwise, the Italian forces in North Africa can be considered lost. Their offensive power has been destroyed by the British in one fell swoop, and Egypt's Nile region is no longer threatened. The defeat of the Italian forces will have a political impact on both Europe and the Far East. Japan now has reason to reconsider its hasty decision to join the Tripartite Pact. Even if the strong domestic reaction in Italy does not overthrow the Fascist regime, Mussolini may not receive much assistance from Germany, and Japanese assistance is even more out of the question. In practical terms, if one member of the Tripartite Pact collapses, it becomes questionable whether the pact can be preserved. The impact of the Italian defeat will greatly invigorate the Balkan Peninsula. Greece will be encouraged to continue its courageous actions, and the scope of assistance that Britain can provide will also expand. Yugoslavia will strengthen its position as a result, and the wisdom of Turkey's policy will also be proven. Axis propaganda in Bulgaria will suffer a major setback. Many pro-British people in France will gain new hope and encouragement from British victories, while Laval's policies will be further rejected by the French people as those of a soldier who has been spurned.

New York, Prominent writer and commentator Steel delivered a shocking radio address today, stating that he believes a bloody purge will soon occur in Italy, on a scale similar to those carried out by Hitler. Steel continued, stating that Italy as a whole may experience a thorough and radical upheaval. Fascist extremists, with the assistance of the German secret police, will attempt to eliminate prominent figures whom they believe are responsible for this decisive defeat. Fascist radicals believe that the current setback in Italy is due to the fact that Italy, unlike Germany, has not made a total war effort. Steel also cited discussions in Italian newspapers to support his claim. (13th Reuters dispatch)

### British Forces Unleash Power in North Africa; Capture of Sollum Awaiting Confirmation

London, According to recent news from Cairo, the British offensive against the Italian forces continues to gain momentum. The progress of the war is so rapid that communiqués can hardly keep up with it. According to telegraphs from Cairo, the recently announced number of 20,000 Italian prisoners of war may still be an underestimate. British forces are currently in hot pursuit of the retreating Italian troops and have no time to calculate the large quantities of military supplies and equipment captured. Since the beginning of the offensive, the Royal Air Force has controlled the skies daily. All Italian forward airfields have been heavily bombed by British aircraft, preventing Italian aircraft from intercepting British planes bombing Italian troops and transportation lines. This demonstrates the assistance that the Royal Air Force has provided to the British advance. It is reported that when a large number of Blackshirts retreated from Sollum, they were strafed by British aircraft, scattering in great disorder. In addition, the Royal Navy is harassing the Italian forces along the coast. The two major bases of Sollum and Banghazi have been heavily bombed by British warships. (13th Reuters dispatch)

London, This station received a report from the Ankara Radio Station stating that British troops continued their advance in Africa yesterday afternoon. After fierce fighting, they captured Sollum, an important city in the northwestern corner of Egypt. The report stated that as a result of the astonishing battle launched by the British on Sunday, Sidi Barrani was captured on Wednesday, along with other victories on the African front. Sollum is located on the Gulf of Sollum, making its location a favorable base for British offensives against Italian and Turkish forces. The capture of Sollum follows closely after the capture of Sidi Barrani. The news of Sollum's capture arrived after Prime Minister Churchill told the House of Commons that "the entire coastal area of Africa, with the exception of one or two strongholds, is now in the hands of British troops." The capture of Sollum has not yet been confirmed by British military circles. (13th United Press dispatch)

Cairo, This morning, British military authorities stated that more than one-third of the Italian army in northern Libya has been destroyed by British forces. At the same time, British mechanized units are threatening Sollum, Italy's last major base in Egypt. According to statistics, in the past four days since the British launched their offensive, at least 6,000 of General Graziani's troops have been killed or seriously wounded. British authorities claim that more than 20,000 Italian troops have been captured, and three Italian divisions totaling 45,000 have been annihilated. British reconnaissance planes reported this morning that two-thirds of the remaining Italian troops are retreating towards Sollum but are being pursued by British aircraft. It is also reported that British forces are pressing the Italian flanks and rear. According to unconfirmed reports, Sollum is now threatened by Free French, Indian, and other British forces. The message also states that British forces are driving thousands of Italian troops into bottleneck mountain passes near Sollum. Unless the Italian forces surrender completely, these mountain passes may become their death traps. British mechanized units continue to advance through the dust storms and have captured three more Italian fortresses. This morning at dawn, Ankara Radio Station announced that Sollum had been occupied by British forces. (13th International News Agency dispatch)

### Churchill Reports on the War Situation in the House of Commons

London, Amid cheers in the House of Commons last night, British Prime Minister Churchill reviewed the British offensive in the western Egyptian desert, stating that the capture of Sidi Barrani was "a first-class victory." The coastal area around Sidi Barrani, with the exception of one or two strongholds, has been entirely occupied by British forces. 7,000 Italian prisoners of war have been captured and transported to Mersa Matruh. Three Italian divisions, including the Blackshirts, have been largely defeated or captured. It was also disclosed here that three Italian generals were captured in the Sidi Barrani area, named Galina, Bakardo, and Mesari. (13th Reuters dispatch)

### Sudden Gale Rises, Sand and Dust Fly; British Aircraft Continue Extensive Operations

Cairo, Yesterday, a sudden gale rose, and sand and dust flew all day. Several parts of the desert, including airfields, appeared as if shrouded in heavy fog in London when viewed from afar. However, British bombers continued to take off and carry out their harassing missions, and the Italian forward airfields and the Italian air force base of Benina were heavily attacked. The severity of the attack may be unprecedented in the Near East air raids. Italian aircraft and hangars within the field were destroyed. A large unit of Italian Blackshirts retreating from somewhere midway to Sollum was severely strafed by British aircraft, causing chaos. A large motorized transport convoy in the area was also bombed, causing heavy damage. British aircraft also attacked Sollum, dropping several tons of bombs, and eight Italian airfields, including Gambut, were bombed yesterday. Several enemy aircraft parked within the field were destroyed. The communique states that details of these attacks have not yet been obtained. British fighter planes patrolled over British troops all day yesterday and shot down eight enemy aircraft, six of which have been confirmed. One unidentified aircraft was also destroyed on the ground. British aircraft conducted the above-mentioned extensive operations for 24 hours without ceasing. Only one did not return. A British aircraft reported missing in Tuesday's communique has now safely returned to its original defense. Due to weather conditions, some British bombers were unable to find their original airfields upon returning and landed at other emergency airfields. (13th Reuters dispatch)

### Both Armies Rely on Mobile Forts; Water Sources Contested in the Desert

Rome, Frontline reports: General Graziani, Governor of Libya, has dispatched 1,000 Fascist motorcycles into the desert to engage British forces. The military objectives of both sides are the various water holes, wells, and palm trees. Both armies rely on mobile forts. The main weapon of the Italian forces is the tank, while the British forces use trucks equipped with giant tires. (Note: Italian sources did not mention who controls Sidi Barrani and Sollum.) (13th United Press dispatch)

Rome, Italian journalist Gayda published an article in the "Italian Daily," stating that Britain is exaggerating its victories to encourage people who have been bombed by German aircraft and to persuade the United States to aid Britain. It is also a strategy of psychological warfare against Italy. Italy will not retreat at this time and will continue to shoulder a difficult and glorious mission. (13th Haitong dispatch)

### Strategic Alliance of British Land, Sea, and Air Wins Praise

London, The astonishing staff work that enabled the British forces to achieve such a successful lightning offensive in the Western Desert has won unanimous praise from military experts around the world. According to currently released information, this offensive appears to have been in preparation for several weeks. A group of British mechanized units continues to harass Italian forces at a certain location. This action allows the British to maintain a gap in the Italian lines, preventing the Italian forces from communicating and allowing British motorized units to break through the gap according to plan. The Italian forces were completely surprised by this British offensive. Within two hours, British forces had captured the first target, and the entire offensive plan was put into effect. British mobile units launched a combined action against Sidi Barrani, while heavy artillery and other units directly attacked the area. This two-pronged strategy cut off the Italian forces in Sidi Barrani and its surrounding areas, eventually forcing them to surrender. At this point, the war entered its second stage, which is currently underway. British forces are pursuing the retreating Italian forces along the coastal road that they worked so hard to build. The cooperation between the British Navy, Air Force, and Army remains close and effective. The extent of the Italian retreat is currently unknown and will be revealed in the next communique.

### Blackshirt Soldiers Fall Apart; British Army Engages in Cleanup Operations

London, According to military sources, the British army is now actively engaged in clearing the various battlefields in the Western Desert. Due to the great distances involved, supply is problematic. The British army has advanced since Monday and has occupied large swathes of land and captured a large number of prisoners. In this vast area, there is still a need for cleanup operations. Although the Italian forces scattered throughout this vast area have fallen apart, there are still isolated pockets of resistance that must be cleared. It is reported that British forces encountered sandstorms during the five days of fighting, and some tanks and vehicles required minor repairs. Therefore, military sources here believe that the British army's temporary halt to its advance is nothing to worry about. General O'Connor is the general in command of the desert forces.

### Mediterranean Coasts; War Situation Developments; Soviet Union and Portugal Are Concerned

Moscow, Local newspapers reflect the Soviet Union's concern about the fighting on the Albanian and Egyptian borders. The Communist Party newspaper "Pravda" featured the large headline on its foreign news page: "British Offensive in the West" and "Italian Forces Retreat in Albania." The newspaper detailed the British capture of Sidi Barrani and described the terrain and the Italian defenses in Sidi Barrani and Sollum. It also quoted "Basler Zeitung" as saying that the fighting in Greece and the British attack on Taranto had affected the Italian forces stationed in Libya. News from New York about the United States increasing aid to Britain was also prominently published in Moscow newspapers. The trade union newspaper "Trud" published a lengthy article on the matter, ending with a quote from "New York Post," saying that the intensification of the struggle between Germany and Britain had further increased the United States' great concern for Britain's survival. (13th Reuters dispatch)

Lisbon, The Portuguese people are very concerned about the British and Greek victories. Crowds gathered in the streets to watch the latest news from Albania and Egypt in the evening newspapers. However, before the screening of wartime newsreels in cinemas, a notice was shown on the screen warning the public not to engage in any demonstrations in order to maintain Portugal's neutrality. An editorial in the conservative party newspaper discussed the reasons for Mussolini's launch of the Greek war, stating, "In this war, Italy has suffered heavy sacrifices, and Mussolini's prestige has been greatly damaged." It concluded that Mussolini's move was based more on political reasons than strategic reasons. Mussolini believed that Italy should have its own war, conduct the war on its own, and have its own battlefield. Unexpectedly, this effort to build a political structure was thwarted within three or four weeks. (13th Reuters dispatch)

### Friction Occurs Within Italy

Rome, The Fascist Party newspaper criticized a certain army officer, saying that he should keep his mouth shut and not say that the country did not need to attack Greece and that the number of divisions attacking Greece was insufficient. The newspaper's comments clearly referred to retired Army Chief of Staff General Badoglio, and said that the officer had initially claimed that he was capable of shouldering this great responsibility. Therefore, the responsibility for the failure of this war should be borne by the military leaders, not by the government leaders. (13th United Press dispatch)

Lake Otri, United Press correspondent Barrioloco reported from the Greek southern front that captured Italian officers frankly admitted to friction between the Italian army and the Fascist Party. According to a captured officer, "I fear that this friction will cause a strong reaction in Italy and give the Communists an opportunity they have been waiting for." (13th United Press dispatch)

Editorial

### A Comparative View of Chinese and Japanese Paper Money

Following the United States, Britain has also taken action to provide loans to China. It is proposed that half of the funds be used to support China's legal tender: Mr. Song Ziwen will be traveling to London to discuss the details. Without delving into the specifics, it is clear that the future foundation of China's legal tender will be as solid as gold. At this time, let's examine Japanese finance.

The Japanese Ministry of Finance is revising its paper money issuance system and plans to submit it to the next session of the Diet. It is said that the main points are: first, to use the maximum amount issued in each year as a standard for estimating future banknote issuance; and second, to change the former practice of using cash and securities separately as reserves, and now propose to use gold, silver, government bonds, and commercial securities as banknote reserves, and rename them as total reserves. Because the number of banknotes issued daily by the Bank of Japan is enormous, it is inevitable to make this revision as a temporary expedient. As for the banknote issuance systems of the Banks of Korea and Taiwan, although no decisions have been made yet, the state bank is already like this, so the measures of the two banks in Korea and Taiwan are not far from imagination.

Japan is deeply mired and unable to extricate itself. Gold and silver wealth have successively turned into steel and sand, leading to the malignant inflation of paper money. Furthermore, it does not know how to restrain its ambitions and still thinks of advancing to the south. Such militarism can only drain the pond to catch the fish. Therefore, the current legislative destruction of its original issuance system is a necessity of the situation. Looking at its proposals, one is to conceal the emptiness of its paper money base, and the other is to adapt to its unprecedented budget of 11 billion yen for the coming year. This is not only to cut flesh to heal sores, but in fact, it is tantamount to destroying the foundation to maintain the branches. What degree of fragility and hardship its future national strength and people's livelihood will reach needs no further explanation. Moreover, it will be very difficult for Japan to seek foreign exchange in overseas markets in the future. The economic blockade by the United Kingdom and the United States, both in tangible and intangible ways, is strengthening controls. Japan will not only be unable to obtain more foreign exchange from them, but it will also be difficult to find raw materials. Therefore, its only means of squeezing is to extract foreign exchange from Tianjin and Shanghai and to plunder materials in the occupied areas of China for export. But still, there is no way to eliminate its hidden dangers.

Those who do not understand the matter or the big picture, seeing that the exchange rate of Japanese currency in the occupied areas is far above that of legal tender, regard it as proof that Japanese currency has stronger credit, but they do not know that this is a man-made effect. It is like the setting sun, whose shadow is larger than when the sun is at its zenith. The occupied areas are under the military force of the Japanese, and they can ask for anything they want. Such a forced exchange rate is not enough to be accurate. Moreover, its purpose is still to seize as much legal tender as possible. Its value is only raised due to its greed, its ruthlessness, and its poverty. It has no relationship with true credit or true value.

As for what the future position of China's legal tender will be, this newspaper has repeatedly stated it. Both the loans from the United Kingdom and the United States, whether they are used to enrich foreign exchange funds or strengthen the preparation of legal tender, are "effective and valuable assistance." However, if the results of the aid are indirectly taken away by others, we know that the three countries, China, Britain, and the United States, will never be so stupid. Therefore, technical problems are of great importance. Mr. Song Ziwen's must go from the United States to the United Kingdom, it can be seen that the two loans are used for the same purpose, then there must be a consistent approach. As for what the approach will be, it is a matter of Chinese national policy and cannot be speculated or predicted. We firmly believe that it will soon be clear. However, it can be imagined that if the black market in Shanghai is as laissez-faire as it was before, and the strength of British and American maintenance is as exhausted as the former balancing fund, then although aid to China today is generous and beneficial to China, there will be a great loophole in it. Learning from the past, we should definitely correct it. We still remember that after the August 13th Shanghai battle, the British were complacent in their preconceptions and confused by short-term interests. Their plans were not good and have been dragging on to this day, still seeking improvement. Looking back at the initial outbreak of the European War, the free gold pound in the New York market was once chaotic, but it was rectified in a few months. Although the situation related to China is not entirely comparable, the interests of China and the United Kingdom and the United States are now closely aligned, so if we sincerely cooperate to plan for it, things must be successful. We are aware of the previous losses, and prevention can be expected. In short, if China's foreign exchange is not adjusted, then the way to adjust it is that British and American banks should strictly build a warning line for China's foreign exchange, and use the long-term interests of the entire Chinese nation as the standard for making decisions. It should give preference to the external operations in the free Chinese zone, so as to maximize the strength of the anti-Japanese construction, and strengthen the control of the foreign economy. If we do this, although the Chinese people in the occupied areas may have panic for a while, and British and American businesses may be restricted for a while, this should be the basis of the common policy of China, Britain, and the United States. For the common interests of the three countries, the United Kingdom and the United States should not only provide assistance out of sympathy to the financial institutions in China, but should also take active actions to help China reform and reorganize the distorted state of the current financial world, without hindering the proper use of China's financial sector. The greatness of this move is self-evident. With the establishment of the policy, the Chinese people will be more aware of the position of legal tender; and the stability of the people's hearts can make the promotion of the policy achieve twice the result with half the effort.

### Vietnamese Authorities Prepare to Negotiate with Thailand; French Aircraft Carry Out Retaliation Against Thailand; Thailand Claims French Forces Shell Two Towns

Hanoi, Yesterday, French aircraft flew to Muk City, west of Savannakhet in Thailand, and dropped 24 bombs, retaliating for the Thai aircraft's bombing on Wednesday. According to the pilots, French aircraft hit several Thai aircraft on the ground and dropped two incendiary bombs near the local governor's office. At the same time, it was announced that the authorities in French Vietnam are now prepared to negotiate with Thailand to resolve the border conflict. A government spokesman said yesterday, "Thailand's Laitai claimed this morning that Thailand believes a delegation is about to arrive in Thailand to resolve border incidents and re-demarcate the border." He said, "This delegation has been waiting in Vietnam since October for a better time to go to Bangkok. Vietnam has asked Thailand to set a date for the talks, but Thailand has not yet responded. Thailand and Vietnam reached an agreement on border incidents in June, exchanging official documents. Unfortunately, the documents from Paris were lost on the plane, so Paris replaced them with telegrams. Thailand claims that France cannot provide official documents and at the same time demands more extensive border changes, which we have refused, and the conflict has arisen. Now, all that is needed is for the Thai side to officially schedule the date of the meeting, and our representatives will set off on their journey." (13th United Press dispatch)

French Delegation Will Go to Tokyo

According to an official statement here, the Vietnamese government will send the Finance Minister, Gu Xing, to lead an economic delegation to Japan. At the same time, the French government in Vichy will also send a delegation to Tokyo via Moscow. They will negotiate according to the political agreement between Vietnam and France approved by the former French Foreign Minister Baodu'en. Responsible people here said that recently, the business between Vietnam and the French headquarters and colonies, and the Anglo and Luxembourg countries has virtually ceased. Vietnam must maintain close economic cooperation with Japan. Vietnamese-Japanese business benefits both sides. Vietnam can supply important raw materials, and Japan can supply various industrial products, which were originally supplied by other countries and are currently unable to trade with Vietnam. 13th Haitong dispatch)

Tokyo, Hasegawa, a financial expert from the Japanese commander in Hanoi, arrived here yesterday from Vietnam and told reporters that the Japanese-French economic negotiations on Vietnam would be successful. He will participate in the Japanese-French talks to be held in Tokyo in a few days. The Vietnamese authorities are well aware that to promote the Far East group, they must cooperate with Japan. Therefore, after the completion of the economic negotiations, Japan can still use Vietnam's iron ore, coal, and other raw materials in its construction process. (13th Haitong dispatch)

### Review of *Su Bao*: Japan's Current Situation

Chongqing, Moscow Dispatch: *Red Star Daily* published an article reviewing the international situation, discussing Japan's economic predicament and domestic political crisis in detail. According to the report, Japan has spent a significant amount of money, totaling 10.1 billion yen, in the three and a half years of war against China, leading to a dire economic situation at home. National debt is increasing daily, and cash is running out. If Japan intends to support a long-term war in China and implement its southward advance plan, it must reform its domestic economy and countermeasures. The Konoe Cabinet is currently implementing a plan to thoroughly control industry, which has sparked opposition from business leaders, intensifying conflicts. Araki and Ugaki are also figures who oppose the government. The recent inclusion of Hiranuma in the cabinet is widely believed to be an attempt by the government to resolve the domestic political crisis and a concession to extreme right-wing figures. Japanese newspapers believe that the formation of the Konoe-Hiranuma group will lead to significant changes in Japanese domestic politics, but this compromise is only a temporary phenomenon.

### Japanese Army in Tianjin Holds Air Defense Drill

Tianjin: The air defense drill organized by the Japanese in this area started at noon today. During these 26 hours, the wailing of air raid sirens and the loud ringing of bells will make Chinese and foreign residents imagine the current situation in the European war zone. At night, searchlights will illuminate the sky, and the roar of Japanese aircraft in the sky will be added. Rescue and fire brigades are ready to stand by, and a large number of police officers and volunteers will assist, making the situation realistic. The only thing missing is probably anti-aircraft artillery. Foreign authorities have fully cooperated, announcing the regulations to be observed in advance through advertisements and distributing leaflets to Chinese residents. Words with air defense slogans are posted in the streets. Many British expatriates are also providing services to show their sincerity in cooperation. The Sino-Japanese War initially broke out in areas adjacent to Tianjin, and Tianjin residents could hear the sound of gunfire. Now that the war has entered its fourth year and the main battlefields are far from here, the Japanese suddenly conducting this exercise, which is unprecedented in Tianjin, has caused general residents to speculate that the war may be returning to its place of origin. (13th Reuters Dispatch)

Tianjin: The Japanese authorities in Tianjin have decided to implement a blackout from noon today until midnight tomorrow. At that time, general residents, although not needing to be as cautious as British residents recently, must use curtains to cover all windows and doors in the city's buildings to prevent indoor light from leaking out. The French Concession also plans to hold a blackout at the same time. The Japanese military authorities have also issued a notice asking residents to cooperate and abide by the following regulations: (1) During an air raid, all indoor and outdoor lights should be turned off; (2) As soon as the first air raid warning is issued, lights should be covered, and all vehicles should travel in accordance with special regulations. Cars must dim their lights and the speed must not exceed 12 miles per hour; (3) As soon as an emergency warning is issued, all vehicles must stop, and fire extinguishing and anti-poison drills will be held.

### Wu Guozhen Discusses Construction of the Provisional Capital

Chongqing: Regarding the construction of Greater Chongqing, Mayor Wu Guozhen recently stated that the municipal government is currently considering a large-scale construction plan, such as adding bridges over the Jialing River and Yangtze River, opening new roads, widening existing roads, building new-style ditches, and establishing large warehouses, which will all be discussed by the Provisional Capital Design Committee. (According to reports, the committee is chaired by Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi and Mayor Wu Guozhen of Chongqing.) It is estimated that the total area of Greater Chongqing will be 75,000 acres, an increase of eight times compared to its former site. Rumors that the urban area will be converted into a commercial district, the north bank of the Yangtze River into an industrial district, and the south bank into a residential district are completely unfounded. Currently, there are at least a thousand newly built shops in the rubble of Chongqing, most of which are two-story buildings, but very simple and well-lit. The National Relief Commission has provided small loans to each shop to help them resume business as soon as possible. From the beginning of October to the 5th of this month, the people submitted a total of 10,977 applications to the Social Affairs Bureau to build houses, of which 730 have already been approved.

### Greek Troops Bravely Fight in Snowstorms; Continued Progress on the Northern Front; Left Wing Approaches Tepelene; Port of Palermo Falls to Greek Troops

Athens: The famous blue-skirted unit of brave Greek soldiers fiercely fought the Italian troops yesterday and captured a mountain peak that controls the northern flank of the Albanian theater. The Italian troops along the coast retreated slowly from the port of Palermo to Kima last night. The main obstacle to the Greek advance on Elbasan is the Mokra Mountain Range. After Greek troops decided to lose the northern peaks of the ridge, they counterattacked desperately. Yesterday, they had rushed to Podos. After three days of bloody battle, the Greek troops have retaken several mountain tops. The Italian troops responding to the battle are the elite Alpine ski troops. Snowstorms are raging in the mountainous war zone, and aircraft cannot operate, so the 30-mile front is purely an infantry battlefield. (13th United Press Dispatch)

Athens: Greek troops are still maintaining the initiative and have been successful in fighting on the entire 80-mile front. Italian counterattacks have all been repelled. A Greek spokesperson stated last night that the Greek left wing is continuing to advance towards the city of Kima (20 miles north of Santi Quaranta) on the Adriatic Sea. Italian troops at several points to the south resisted fiercely but were eventually driven out of their positions with heavy losses. The Italian side also transferred elite Alpine troops to fight fiercely in the coastal area around Tepelene. It is reported that one colonel of the army has been killed and many members of the unit have been captured. When the Greek troops retreated from Argirocastro, they took advantage of the situation to advance along the foothills beside the Drinos River and are now approaching Tepelene. According to information obtained here, the Italian troops plan to put up a stubborn resistance on the coast. The weather is rapidly deteriorating, but the Greek troops continue to occupy key mountain peaks. In the past 36 hours, they have divided their troops into three routes and advanced rapidly, surrounding an important central location. The future development of the war may depend on this one place. The snow on the western front is three feet thick, and the Greek troops' advance in that area has been temporarily slowed, but the Greek troops' victory in this area is quite satisfactory. (13th Reuters Dispatch)

Athens: The Greek government has officially announced that the port of Palermo, the second major base of Italy in Albania, has been occupied by Greek troops. (13th United Press Dispatch)

Athens: Yesterday, war reports received here stated that although the snow in the mountains of northern Albania has reached five feet, the Greek troops are still using white hats as camouflage, fighting through wind and snow, and repelling repeated counterattacks by Italian troops in the eight-mile war zone. At the same time, it was reported that less fierce counterattacks by Italian troops in the central and southern regions were also repelled by Greek troops. The Greek troops are advancing with bayonet charges towards Tepelene, Kima, and Vlora. In the northern area west of Pogradets, reinforcements of the Italian mountain troops are fiercely counterattacking, attempting to stop the three-pronged Greek advance. The Greek offensive may surround the important central base of Elbasan and directly head towards Acyntila, 24 miles further north. (13th International News Service Dispatch)

### German Air Force Launches Fierce Attack on British Steel Industry Center; City of Sheffield Bombed for the First Time; British Adopt New Tactics to Counter German Aircraft

London: A bulletin from the Air Ministry stated that last night's enemy aircraft attacks focused on an industrial area in northern England. A certain town was most severely damaged, with several houses destroyed. Some roads were either damaged or temporarily blocked by the bombing. Enemy aircraft used a large number of incendiary bombs for the bombing, but the resulting fires were quickly brought under control. The reports currently received are not yet complete, but it is expected that the casualties may not be excessively numerous. In other towns in the area, casualties were very few. Elsewhere in England, only sporadic bombs fell, with minimal damage and casualties. Two enemy bombers were destroyed that night. (13th Reuters Dispatch)

London: Last night's German air raid caused the most damage to Sheffield. The German aircraft bombing the city flew in successively from bases in France and Belgium. According to the German News Agency, the German aircraft targeted the area's important armaments factories. (13th Reuters Dispatch)

Berlin: According to responsible sources, German aircraft concentrated on bombing the city of Sheffield last night. Although the weather was bad at the time, German aircraft repeatedly dropped heavy bombs, and fires broke out everywhere. As of 3 a.m. this morning, the bombing was still continuing. German aircraft attacked the British military industry according to a predetermined plan, first bombing Coventry, Bristol, Southampton, London, and Birmingham, and Sheffield has also been bombed. (13th Haitong Dispatch)

Berlin: The German Air Force yesterday fiercely bombed Sheffield, the steel center of Britain. The city is full of steel factories, producing 500,000 tons of steel annually, accounting for 15% of Britain's total steel production, making it one of the centers of the British armaments industry. It was heavily damaged in yesterday's German bombing. (13th Haitong Dispatch)

London: It is believed here that the British have already tried out their new defense tactics to resist the German aircraft that attacked last night and in the early hours of this morning. The British dispatched night fighters to the eastern coast on a moonlit night to intercept German aircraft that flew across the sea intermittently and attacked England for two hours. However, the Nazi air formations broke through British defenses and continued to concentrate their attacks on a certain town in the Midlands in turn for several hours. Even though anti-aircraft artillery fire was firing, it was difficult to curb their momentum. The air raid on the certain town in the Midlands was particularly tragic and was continuously attacked until the early hours of this morning. The town's shopping center was severely damaged, a church in a residential area was destroyed, and bombs fell frequently around a hotel, causing it to be surrounded by explosions. In London, there was another slight and infrequent air raid, with bombs only falling in certain areas, and the damage was reportedly not very great. It was also reported that there were no casualties. There were some casualties in a certain town in the Midlands. While large formations of German aircraft were bombing the town, other German aircraft formations flew over a southern coastal area, engaging in far more intense activity than in recent nights. German aircraft still adopted their usual tactics last night, first launching incendiary bombs, followed by high-explosive bombs. (13th United Press Dispatch)

### Eton College Bombed Twice

London: Eton College, the most famous school in England, founded by Henry IV 500 years ago, has been bombed twice by German aircraft in recent weeks.

### Hungary and Yugoslavia Sign Treaty of Friendship; Maintain Peace in Central Europe; and Jointly Seek Constructive Cooperation; Border Issues Not Discussed

Capital of Yugoslavia: Officials have announced that the Treaty of Friendship between Hungary and Yugoslavia was signed here today. The three main provisions are as follows: (1) The signatory countries shall maintain peaceful and friendly relations permanently; (2) The parties agree to consult each other immediately in the event of any problem arising between them that may affect their relations; (3) The treaty shall enter into force immediately upon ratification by both signatory countries, after the exchange of instruments of ratification in the capital of Hungary. (12th Havas Dispatch)

Capital of Yugoslavia: After Yugoslavia and Hungary signed a Treaty of Friendship here last night, both diplomatic authorities spoke to reporters, pointing out that this treaty is a new contribution to maintaining peace in Southeastern Europe. Yugoslav Foreign Minister Marković said that this treaty is conducive to peace and to the constructive cooperation that the governments of Yugoslavia and Hungary intend to carry out in the Danube River basin. Hungarian Foreign Minister Csaky spoke of the trust and friendship on which the two countries are united, saying that this treaty is a firm guarantee that the people of the two countries can move towards success along the common path they have chosen. (13th Reuters Dispatch)

Belgrade: Hungarian Foreign Minister Csaky left here last night by special train to attend a hunting event held by the Hungarian Royal Family in the Alps. (13th Haitong Dispatch)

Belgrade: According to sources familiar with the matter this morning, the issue of recognizing the current Hungary-Yugoslavia border was not discussed during Hungarian Foreign Minister Csaky's visit to the capital of Yugoslavia. According to these sources, there is no need to discuss this issue because Prince Paul, Regent of Yugoslavia, said in his broad speech on September 1st that the recognition of Yugoslavia's independence and territorial integrity is a prerequisite for negotiations between Yugoslavia and third countries. (13th Haitong Dispatch)

Capital of Yugoslavia: According to official sources here, Axis propagandists have defined the Yugoslavia-Hungary Friendship Treaty as a sign that Yugoslavia is joining the Axis. In fact, the signing of this treaty merely shows Yugoslavia's deep desire to maintain peace and Hungary's desire to obtain a basis for conducting diplomatic policies outside the scope of Axis goodwill. Diplomatic circles here believe that Yugoslavia, Hungary, and Romania will agree to combine their interests in the defense of the Balkan Peninsula and the Danube River, without being subject to the new order of the Axis powers. (13th Reuters Dispatch)

Capital of Yugoslavia: Political figures here declared today that yesterday's signing of the Yugoslavia-Hungary Friendship and Non-Aggression Treaty erected another barrier to the possibility of the Italo-Greek war affecting the Balkans. It is pointed out that the signing of the treaty not only creates an indirect connection between Yugoslavia and the new European order proposed by the Axis powers, but also creates a significant connection between Yugoslavia and the Axis military alliance, since Hungary is a member of the alliance. Hungary and Romania were close in the past and had not been estranged for hundreds of years. Later, when Yugoslavia seized some territory from Hungary after the end of World War I, the two countries began to become hostile. Now, the old friendship between the two countries has been restored through this treaty. (13th International News Service Dispatch)

### Bulgaria Seeks to Improve Relations with Turkey; New Proposals Have Been Submitted; Military Alliance Rumors Unfounded

(13th Haitong News Agency Dispatch)

Capital of Turkey: Rumors that the Turkish government has suggested to the Bulgarian government to sign a military alliance treaty have been denied by political figures here. The friendly relations between the two countries are normal and there is no change. Bulgarian Foreign Minister Popov has issued a statement to this effect. (12th Havas News Agency Dispatch)

### Turkey Economic Consolidation Seydan Delivers Speech

Ankara. Turkish Prime Minister Seydan, in a speech on the anniversary of National Economy Week, stated that Turkey's economic strength has reached a level that can influence the final outcome of world wars. Wars between countries have now changed from purely simple combat actions to competitions of economic support. Turkey's position in industry and agriculture is far superior to that of 1914, and Turkey's finances are also strong. Turkey still trusts its own economic capabilities, he said. (Reuter, 13th)

### Bishop Ward Broadcast Speech States US Has Possibility of Being Drawn into War Greatly Admired Chinese Leaders

Chongqing. Bishop Ward, former leader of American missions in Southwest China and the lower Yangtze River region, broadcast yesterday, stating that the United States is approaching the danger of war. Ward stated that if the government handles things properly, the United States will definitely not take preemptive action, but the American public sentiment has indeed moved closer to a dangerous situation. He fears that the United States may already be facing this danger. If some country takes action against the United States similar to an act of war, he fears that neither the president nor Congress will be able to prevent the United States from being drawn into the war. Ward further stated that the spirit of the American people this year is completely different from last year, because Ward had contacted public and private groups twice during his six months in the United States, once to give speeches and once to talk with public and private groups. Ward also stated that last year, the American people still felt annoyed and unwilling to ask about international affairs, the merits of the New Deal, and whether an isolated America had value. Now, President Roosevelt has again requested ten billion yuan for national defense, and Congress no longer creates difficulties for the executive branch and public opinion, and the American economic structure is also ready to adapt to this crisis. Various factories have already increased their efficiency, and many factories have expanded their plant bases. Every shipyard is filled with new construction. Relations between the countries of the Americas have greatly improved and are gradually becoming closer, and American wealth has also flowed out for the cooperation of the Western Hemisphere. Ward also stated that he always feels happy when he thinks of returning to Chongqing, but this time he returns and witnesses the vast destruction and the unspeakable suffering of the Chinese people, and he is filled with infinite sorrow. Although he is happy to be back this time, he is deeply admired by the calm attitude and clear determination of the leaders in leading the people. Ward also predicted that London will follow the example of Chongqing, rebuild and widen roads, and immediately restore daily life after each air raid. Ward also stated that the meager American relief funds are now being used to build houses for the poor and workers whose homes have been destroyed along the Yangtze River in Chongqing. Ward also stated that the progress of the Chinese is largely due to the calm, firm, and consistent habits of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek. (Ward had an audience with Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek yesterday.) Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek is like the sages of ancient China, and he will never deviate from the principles he adheres to for himself and the country. The war in China and the war in Europe are both part of the world war, and China has gradually become one of the most important countries in the world war. (United Press, 13th)

### Huang Xuchu Talks About Nanning After the Calamity

Chongqing. Huang Xuchu, chairman of the Guizhou Province, declared yesterday that southern Guizhou has been occupied by the Japanese army for as long as eleven months, and it is now barren everywhere and full of sorrow. Huang led many Kuomintang members to inspect Nanning after the calamity and other areas in southern Guizhou for thirty-seven days. Huang stated that in Nanning alone, there are 50,000 households with little or no means of livelihood, and most have suffered damage. Nanning city is full of wine bottles everywhere. At least 4,000 residents of Nanning have been killed, and at least 12,000 livestock have been slaughtered. Countless wood has been taken away, at least 12 million dan. In Longzhou, Chairman Huang stated that the disaster was even worse. The area along the highway from Nanning has suffered a great deal, and farmhouses in nearby villages have been reduced to scorched earth. Chairman Huang also stated that the rural people are already very poor, and every kind of food, even salt, has been taken away by the Japanese army. Chairman Huang also stated that according to estimates by Catholic priests, the Japanese spend 500,000 to 800,000 yuan per day in Nanning. The Japanese have expanded the Nanning airfield to two and a half times its original size, built roads, and added some repair shops and defensive equipment. This phenomenon shows that the Japanese intend to hold on to Nanning. More than 40,000 refugees who have fled to various places have returned to Nanning. Although these people are saddened by the destruction of their homes, they are full of hope and want to rebuild the area. Relief is indispensable. The National Government has promised to allocate a large sum of money to be used for relief in Guizhou Province. Chairman Huang also stated that various means of transportation such as highways, waterways, telegraphs, and postal services have now been restored, and police and health agencies are also performing their duties. Preparations are also being stepped up to resume banking operations and reopen schools. (United Press, 13th)

### US Is Studying Matsuoka's Remarks Preparing to Cope With Japanese Threats And Feels Aid to China, Britain, the Netherlands Indies, and Australia Is Important Lippmann Bitterly Criticizes Japan for Interfering in US Policy

Washington. American newspapers yesterday published an article by the famous American journalist Lippmann bitterly criticizing Japan for interfering in American affairs, which stated briefly that the recent remarks made by Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka are currently being carefully studied by Americans. The reason for this is that Matsuoka has stated to the United States that Japan will determine the plans adopted by the United States to protect its Atlantic security, which is a good reason for Japan to launch an attack against the United States in the Pacific. Matsuoka said that if Tokyo does not approve of the US policy toward the European war, then Japan will fight the US. Then what can the US do, and what can't the US do? Tokyo will be its judge. Matsuoka also said that if the US interferes in Far Eastern or European affairs, it is not paying attention to its own affairs. Then is Japan, which has initiated a new order in Asia and appointed itself as the judge and executor of American policy in the West, paying attention to its own affairs? According to Matsuoka's remarks, the price of peace is not only to give Japan the right to act freely in the Pacific, but also to recognize Japan's right to review and judge American Atlantic policy. Matsuoka wants the American people to recognize themselves as the people of the Japanese Empire's protectorate, and their foreign policy and Western culture must now be subject to the government's control. It is also difficult for Matsuoka to think that it is wise or beneficial to make such remarks to the United States. Matsuoka must have been misled by inaccurate information from the US ambassador, or even ignored the information he received. Matsuoka should know that the US has the support of British and Dutch strength in the Pacific, and the Singapore and Hawaii ports are the base of its navy, while Japan's allies are blockaded by the British fleet. However, in this situation, Matsuoka dared to demand the right to control American Atlantic foreign policy, and threatened to go to war with the US if such a policy was not satisfactory to Japan. There is nothing more important than Matsuoka's threat to show the need to assist China, Britain, the Netherlands Indies and Australia. The American people are not accustomed to being threatened by other countries, so Americans will have to pay attention to this threat and deal with it so that this threat will never materialize.

### Soviet Eye Hospital Building Moved

Moscow. The Moscow Eye Hospital building, weighing 13,300 tons, has been moved to another location at an angle of 97 degrees and 16 minutes. This relocation work took nine days.

In addition, during the relocation period, 20 surgical operations were performed every day, and all water supply, etc., continued as usual. It is reported that the relevant parties are now preparing to move the hospital another 28.36 meters and raise the hospital by one floor. (TASS, 13th)

### US Ship Crew Protests Transport of War Materials to Japan

New Orleans. The crew members of three American cargo ships here submitted a letter to President Roosevelt yesterday, protesting the transport of war materials to Japan. The three cargo ships, the "Tippleton," the "Recas," and the "Nehama," are all owned by the Recas Brothers Company. The letter stated, "The government recently encouraged and permitted the sale of materials of carnage by the United States, as a fight against the Chinese people for the war of democracy. The "Tippleton" is currently loading gasoline, crude oil and crude petroleum to Japan." (United Press, 13th)

### US Two Parties Endorse Aid to Britain Chase Bank Director Advocates Speedy Loan of Large Sum to Britain

New York. Aldrich, director of Chase Bank and a famous lawyer, spoke at the Boston Chamber of Commerce last night, advocating that before Britain's finances are exhausted, the United States should assist with a large sum of money in a rapid and generous manner, and said that this assistance can come from the federal government's guarantee for Britain's loan from the US Treasury Department or from a direct loan. The Johnson Act and the Neutrality Act do not prohibit the government from providing financial assistance to Britain. Both US parties have endorsed aid to Britain. If this promise has any meaning, then it should be interpreted as our entire financial strength should be the backing for Britain. Therefore, the outcome of the decisive battle is of great interest to the United States. (Reuter, 13th)

### US Has No Intention of Lending to Spain Morgenthau Makes Remarks

Washington. US Treasury Secretary Morgenthau reported at a meeting with reporters yesterday that the United States has no intention of lending money to Spain. He has not heard anything about the rumored loan. Recently, the rumor that the United States has lent a large sum of money to Spain has spread widely. Although Morgenthau made such a statement, non-officials still believe that the United States will not therefore completely cut off aid to Spain, because there are other ways to communicate, such as the Export-Import Bank. Also, regarding Senator Vandenberg's criticism of Treasury Secretary Morgenthau for the US lending money to Country A, Morgenthau commented yesterday that he completely disagreed with his views. His actions were approved by the Senate. When a reporter told him that the proposal to approve Morgenthau's loan was from the Senate Finance and Finance Committee, not the Senate, Morgenthau replied that Vandenberg's and Taft's (also senators who opposed lending money to China) habits will never change, and they all want to publicize in the newspapers. (United Press, 13th)

### After the Death of Ambassador Lothian The Entire United States Unanimously Regrets US President Sends Telegram to the King of England Expressing Deep Mourning The Remains Will Be Carried Back to England by US Warship

Washington. The news of the death of British Ambassador to the United States Lothian has aroused unanimous regret throughout the United States. He was one of the most popular British ambassadors to the United States. Whenever he went to the White House or the State Department, many reporters would wait for him to come out and ask him questions, which he often fulfilled, because Lothian always spoke freely and without concealment within the possible range. At this time of international crisis, the British lost a diplomat who was extremely helpful to the country, and all sectors here are sending their sympathy. The US government has agreed to provide all conveniences for the funeral of Lothian, and some believe that Lothian's remains will be carried back to England by a warship. (Reuter, 13th)

Washington. After the death of British Ambassador Lothian, President Roosevelt sent a telegram to King George VI of England from the USS Tuscaloosa cruiser, saying, The sudden death of your ambassador, my old friend the Marquis of Lothian, has made me unspeakably shocked. For twenty-five years, there has been mutual trust and understanding between us. If God gives me a few more years, I will be able to witness the greatest struggle to maintain democracy, which will eventually be won. Secretary of State Hull also sent a message of condolence to British Prime Minister Churchill, Minister of the Interior Ickes, Treasury Secretary Morgenthau, and First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, all of whom expressed their deep mourning. Lothian was born on April 18, 1882, and was 58 years old this year. (United Press, 13th)

Washington. Last night, the US government prepared to use a warship to transport Lothian's remains back to war-torn Britain so that they could be buried. Officials here believe that the possibility of US warships being attacked in the war zone is extremely small, and pointed out that this procedure is the norm for foreign diplomats who die here. At the same time, there is a lot of speculation about Lothian's successor, and some people have quickly proposed the Duke of Windsor, because the Duke and his wife are well-known and trusted in the United States. Therefore, people signed that the Duke and Duchess, representing Britain, which is at war, are quite suitable for the difficult task of increasing American feelings and actions. (International News Agency, 13th)

### Windsor and Roosevelt Rumored to Meet Windsor Departs by Plane Yesterday

Miami. According to Captain Trury, aide to the British Governor-General and Commander-in-Chief of the Bahamas, the Duke of Windsor will take a US Navy plane to an undisclosed destination today due to important official business. Here, it is not possible to comment on the rumor that the Duke will meet with President Roosevelt, who is currently on the USS Tuscaloosa cruiser in Bahamian waters. According to Trury, he is regretfully unable to disclose details about the destination and purpose of this trip due to a special request from the State Department. The Duke will probably return here soon, and the Duchess will remain in the hospital for the time being. President Roosevelt has completed his inspection of the defenses by ship and has now gone to an undisclosed destination. The President inspected the seaplane base on the island of Mahaquina in the Bahamas yesterday. (Reuter, 13th)

### Nomura Pays Attention to the Yangtze River Issue Will Visit Shanghai Before Taking Office in the US

Tokyo. According to reports here today, Nomura, the new ambassador to the United States, plans to travel to the Yangtze River basin for two or three weeks before taking office. Nomura is scheduled to leave for Shanghai on the 20th of this month and return to China next month. When Nomura was previously the Minister of Foreign Affairs, he promised to open up the Yangtze River for foreign trade and navigation, so he is now paying attention to considering the issue, because he feels that he has some responsibility to fulfill the promises he made. (Reuter, 13th)

### British Newspapers Discuss China's Foreign Exchange Situation The Equalization Fund Has Been Strengthened Future Handling Must Be Careful

London. Today, the City Editor of the Times published an article saying that the Shanghai foreign exchange has had little reaction to the recent news of the US loan to China, and the announcement of the British loan has had no impact on it so far. The main reason for this is probably due to the news that the Nanjing regime intends to issue its own banknotes and make them mutually convertible with Chinese legal tender at par. This development will inevitably pose a threat to legal tender in the areas controlled by the Nanjing regime, and may enable the Nanjing regime to purchase legal tender and obtain foreign exchange. Although the equalization fund for Chinese legal tender will be strengthened due to the British loan, the foreign exchange situation still needs to be handled carefully to avoid this unexpected situation. The reason why previous attempts by banks under Japanese control to issue their own banknotes did not cause much concern was because the value of their new banknotes was not allowed to depreciate along with legal tender. In short, it is an indisputable fact that this loan from Britain and the United States will actually increase China's control over foreign exchange. (Reuter, 13th)

### Merchants in Tokyo and Yokohama Have Disputes Tensions Sharpen Due to the Issue of Opening Ports

Tokyo. Merchants in Tokyo and Yokohama are in sharp opposition due to the dispute over whether the port of Tokyo should be opened for foreign trade. The government recently decided to allow Tokyo to enjoy this privilege of opening the port for trade next spring. Because Tokyo and Yokohama are located in the same bay and are only eighteen miles apart from each other, Yokohama merchants immediately protested. Thirty-five representatives of Yokohama merchants took a public bus from Yokohama to Tokyo to petition Prime Minister Konoe, and distributed leaflets along the way, saying that if Tokyo opened the port, Yokohama's commerce would be destroyed. The residents of Yokohama also held a mass meeting and resolved to resist the government's actions. (United Press, 13th)

### Historically the Grandest Event: The New York World's Fair Concludes

The grand spectacle of the second New York World's Fair in a century, has been briefly introduced in the supplementary issues of this newspaper on July 7th and 14th of this year. Although our fellow countrymen could not personally experience the dazzling and bustling scenes where the city was illuminated day and night, they can still, through the descriptions and records on paper, get a glimpse of this magnificent event. Time flies swiftly, and before we knew it, this World's Fair, after one hundred and seventy nights, has come to a successful conclusion, closing as scheduled on the evening of October 27th.

During the final week before the closing, because this great spectacle was nearing its end, and such a grand event is rare and fleeting, people felt that if they didn't take the time to visit, they might miss their only chance. Therefore, on Saturday evening, October 26th, the day before the closing, the number of visitors reached 260,100 by 10 p.m. On the evening of the closing, the number of people was even greater, and the scene was unprecedented. At 11:57 p.m. that night, Mr. Gibson, Chairman of the Board of the World's Fair, delivered a brief closing speech, and thus, this vibrant World's Fair "closed its doors" after his few words.

On the day of the closing, there was a large-scale masquerade parade in the venue. Nearly a thousand people dressed in various exotic costumes participated in the parade. Ten bands took turns playing music, with melodies rising and falling, attracting spectators from all over the venue. Many people were in high spirits and joined the parade. On Saturday evening, the number of visitors entering the venue reached 40,000 per hour. Tickets for every performance in the entertainment venues were sold out, leaving latecomers disappointed. The exhibition halls and businesses of various participating countries were all packed, making triple profits. Many goods were sold at reduced prices to clear out old stock, resulting in especially prosperous business, with customers crowding the doorways.

The situation in the foreign exhibition halls was as lively as described above. However, the Italian exhibition hall was deserted. The reason was that Vice Admiral Caito, an Italian member of the World's Fair Committee, suddenly passed away, and in his memory, the Italian exhibition hall was closed for two days. But after this closure, it never reopened.

On the day of the second World's Fair's closing, everyone didn't seem to realize that it would close the next day, and were all cheerful and excited. On that day, the venue provided various colored ribbons and confetti for free, as well as small toys that could make various sounds, all to add to the lively atmosphere, so that visitors could enjoy themselves on this last day. Under such lively circumstances, many unexpected things had to be prevented. With so many people and so much noise, it was inevitable that there would be petty thieves who would take valuable treasures and rare objects when people weren't paying attention. Some mischief-makers also searched everywhere for souvenirs, stuffing any loose items they could move into their pockets. Therefore, in addition to the existing detectives, the venue added a thousand police officers and two hundred private detectives to provide proper security at all times.

Leading the celebrations on the closing day was the comedic film star Eddie Cantor. His two dark, round, wide-open eyes and expressive face were naturally popular. Having him lead this grand World's Fair filled with laughter and joy was truly the perfect choice. On this closing day, in addition to the bands playing music everywhere to add to the fun, there were also various activities and exhibitions. In the evening, there were magnificent and novel fireworks and shooting stars, even more spectacular than what was usually seen in the venue. In the Peace Plaza, there were performances by North American natives starting from 1 p.m. At 4 p.m., there was a parade of the army and navy retreating from the venue, with neat steps and a grand military appearance, which impressed the audience.

In the evening, on the shores of Freedom Lake, there were grand fireworks displays. In addition to the familiar sparks, silver stars, golden snakes, and jeweled leaves, the fireworks also included performances by the American army and navy, such as the movements of airplanes, giant ships, and submarines, all vividly lifelike, showing great ingenuity. In the Peace Plaza, before 10 p.m., there were performances of parachuting and aerial bombing. This so-called bombing did not involve actually dropping bombs, but rather attaching a bomb under each parachute, with an American flag suspended below the bomb. The flag fluttered slowly in the air, and six searchlights on the ground concentrated their powerful beams on the flag, illuminating it as if it were daytime, which was extremely exciting.

The World's Fair continued to be open for one day after the official closing, specifically for people to take a final look at the venue. It was open from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., with tickets costing two dollars, and five dollars for those with cars. All proceeds were donated to the American Red Cross. The motto of this year's World's Fair was "Peace and Freedom," and using the final revenue for charitable purposes can be said to be true to the purpose of this great exhibition.

From June 29, 1936, when Mr. Warren, General Manager of the World's Fair Corporation, broke ground in the "Flushing Meadow" area where the venue was located, until its closing on October 27th of this year, this New York World's Fair can be said to have been unprecedented in history. The venue was 1,216 acres in size. After the closing, work immediately began to convert it into a park, with everything proceeding according to the design of Mr. Moses, Commissioner of Parks of the New York City government. In the future, this place will be named "Flushing Meadow Park." Such a large World's Fair required countless manpower and financial resources during its construction, and its dismantling will certainly not be completed in a few weeks. According to experts, it will take three to four months to transform this World's Fair into a large park.

From the opening to the closing of the second World's Fair, the total number of paying visitors and those working on-site with access passes was 55 million, breaking all records since the 1851 London Crystal Palace Exhibition. The number of visitors to several famous World's Fairs in the world did not reach this number. If you don't believe it, you can look at the records on the left:

1851, London Crystal Palace Exhibition, occupying 19 acres, 6 million visitors, cost US$1.6 million, revenue US$2.5 million.

1853, Dublin Exhibition, occupying 11 acres, 1 million visitors, cost US$400,000, revenue US$230,000.

### Grain: The Shanghai Municipal Council Restricts Shipping Dates, Slightly Curbing Rice Merchants' Speculation; However, Without Further Measures, the Rice Market Remains Easily Manipulated

Since the rice market rebounded sharply the day before yesterday, yesterday's market opening saw both buyers and sellers holding good prospects and remaining undecided. However, the market issued another announcement, reiterating strict measures to crack down on speculation, requiring a deposit of five yuan per bag for all transactions and clearance within five days, without allowing sufficient time for activity. This dealt a blow to speculators, causing their concerted efforts to dissipate like smoke, forcing them to stand idly by. The market thus showed a softening trend. Since the Shanghai Municipal Council's handling of the rice market, its insistence on a five-day shipping period instead of the rice industry's desired ten-day period is barely satisfactory. However, without further effective measures to clarify the market and bring it into order, the rice market will once again be exploited by rice merchants engaging in speculation and hoarding. As noon approached, general sales, having waited several days, saw their stocks depleted and urgently needing replenishment. Seeing the market hovering and difficult to lower, they invariably proceeded to replenish, causing a temporary surge in sales, with buyers clamoring loudly. However, sales driven by genuine need are not as chaotic and inaccurate as speculative transactions. Therefore, although the market sentiment was unusually firm, the selling price only increased by half a yuan compared to before. The closing prices for Saigon rice No. 1 were 86 yuan and 84 yuan, No. 2 was 80 yuan, 79.5 yuan, and down to 78 yuan, Fire-milled was 84 yuan to 81.4 yuan, No. 2 Siam Mixed was 77 yuan and 76.5 yuan, Small-milled was 77 yuan and 76 yuan, Rice Tea was 73.5 yuan and 71.5 yuan, Broken Rice was 70.2 yuan and 69 yuan, Wuhu Pointed was 74.4 yuan, and Juancheng Pointed was 70 yuan. For repurchase futures, new transactions were made for 1,000 tons of Saigon rice No. 1 for delivery in late January and early February, with the price remaining at 85 yuan, sold by Jian Yuan. Therefore, the repurchase price of Small-pattern Hua Si was slightly flat, with prices opening at 88 yuan to 87.5 yuan. Another 300 tons of No. 2 for December were still at 90 yuan. There were a total of 6,000 bags of spot rice.

The arrival of foreign rice in Shanghai remained strong. Yesterday, the Taikoo Company's Kunming Wheel arrived from Siam with 3,736 bags and from Hong Kong with 795 bags, totaling 4,531 bags. It arrived at the port yesterday morning and docked at the company's wharf on the French Concession Bund for unloading.

The arrival of thick and thin japonica rice and other national rice was still intermittent, while on the sales side, the early market saw general customers taking advantage of the previous day's momentum, resulting in smooth sales. Sellers' intentions were also firm, so prices had been raised by about one yuan. However, once the momentum faltered, the subsequent trend weakened, and as a result, the market situation could only be described as tight. Kunshan Hu saw white japonica rice opening at 96.5 yuan, and falling to 92 yuan. Qingjiao Thin Indica saw 87.5 yuan and 86.5 yuan.

Due to high prices, glutinous rice was scarce in both retail and wholesale. Currently, general major dealers, seeing the poor market sentiment, have been flooding the market with foreign glutinous rice, causing the price of national glutinous rice to plummet by a huge two to three yuan. Liyang White Yuan only opened at 92-3 yuan, falling to around 90 yuan. Although Hong Kong White Yuan was partially supported by foreign rice, it was still unavoidable to sing the same sad song, depreciating accordingly. Special Round-grain opened at 84 yuan, Long-grain at 82-3 yuan, and Sub at 80 yuan.

### 200,000 Bags of American Flour to Arrive Soon, Flour Market Trends Downward

The situation in the foreign flour market is quite bleak. Since the news of large quantities of foreign flour arriving in Shanghai one after another, the market sentiment has been consistently weary, and customers are currently handling customs clearance matters, with new transactions taking a wait-and-see approach. However, the wholesale arrival of goods is still pending. Moreover, as the rice market rises and falls, those holding goods remain firm in their intention to sell. Yesterday's market saw the Flower-Bird-Clock Tower brand Australian flour opening at 19.55 yuan, and then to 19.5 yuan, with over 1,000 bags traded. The price of flat-priced flour remained at 18 yuan, with the Shanliang factories selling over 6,000 bags without any change. It is also heard that another ship of Flag flour is expected to arrive in two or three days, estimated to be around 200,000 bags.

Wheat transactions remain quiet. Sanxin, a Japanese factory, is gradually purchasing futures and is currently negotiating prices, generally around 28.5 yuan. Chinese factories are limiting purchases to 30.05 yuan, and there is no complete amount available for purchase in the market. The market is still brewing.

### Financial Foreign Exchange Settlement is Quite Strong

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no fluctuations in HSBC's official rates. The dark market for British and American exchange rates has been hovering for many days and suddenly tightened. This is due to increased demand and limited supply of distant futures. A potentially soft trend, and in the afternoon, British American Tobacco also purchased, with the current American exchange rate at 5.90625 yuan, making it difficult to settle immediately, causing the tight trend to become prominent. The evening closing prices for spot British gold were 3 shillings 7.34375 pence and the American exchange rate was 5.90625 yuan. The next month's futures have slightly widened.

Early Morning: Chinese Merchants Dump Shillings to Take Advantage of High Prices

In the early morning, with London large bars and distant futures flat, New York silver prices remained flat, and London raw gold was undecided, the exchange rates between British and American, Shanghai, etc. did not move, and the American to British/Shanghai exchange rates did not change either. The central official rates for various exchange rates remained as before. Banks opened the selling price for spot exchange in the morning, with British gold at 3 shillings 7.5 pence and the American exchange rate at 5.9375 yuan, compared to the previous day, American was flat and British was soft by 0.025625. After the opening, Chinese merchant banks sold shillings due to the high price, but foreign firms absorbed them, only willing to pay 3 shillings 7.65625 pence. This price was reported to have been traded. The HSBC official rates were announced as unchanged, and the silver equalization tax did not fluctuate. Later, Chinese speculators came to the market to release American exchange, causing the market to become firmer. It is estimated that foreign firms absorbed 5.96875 yuan for this month. Subsequently, the easing trend stopped as foreign firms made settlements. It is estimated that foreign firms' purchases from foreign firms of American exchange in the same month were 5.96875 yuan, up to 9375. In addition, the next month's American exchange once traded at 5.875 yuan, with a potential softening trend. In the afternoon, the spot price of British gold was 3 shillings 7.5 pence and the American exchange rate was 5.9375 yuan.

British American Tobacco Needs Were Very Strong

In the late market, Chinese banks initially absorbed, with the initial trades remaining flat. It is estimated that British firms such as Macgregor gave American exchange for this month at 5.9375 yuan. Subsequently, as British American Tobacco's needs were very strong, they closed in spot American exchange at 5.90625 yuan, but it was difficult for speculators to purchase. The evening closing prices for spot and this month's American exchange were still 5.90625 yuan, British gold was 3 shillings 7.34375 pence, next month's American exchange was 5.875 yuan, and British gold was 3 shillings 7.1875 pence, compared to the previous day, the near-term British and American exchange rates were soft by 0.03125 each, and the next month's were tight by 0.0625 each.

Hong Kong Exchange Rates are Quite Stable

Hong Kong, 13th (Friday telegram), the exchange market opened flat this morning, with no ups and downs in British and American exchange rates. The Shanghai exchange spot rate rose by one yuan, to 398 yuan (yesterday's closing was 397 yuan), and the Japanese exchange spot rate also softened by one yuan, to 102.5 yuan. At 11:30, it was reported as flat, with no changes in any exchange rates. At 2:30 pm, it was reported as flat, the Shanghai exchange spot rate continued to rise by one yuan, to 399 yuan, and the rest remained unchanged.

Tianjin British and American Exchange Markets Also Showed Contraction

Tianjin, 13th (Friday telegram), the exchange market opened sluggish today, the London telegraphic transfer softened by 0.03125, to 4 shillings 1.5625 pence, the New York telegraphic transfer contracted by 0.0625, to 6.5625 yuan, the Shanghai exchange rose by 0.5 yuan, to 90 yuan, and the "United Currency" dark market also rose by 0.5 yuan, to 87 yuan.

### Foreign Currencies Also Follow Upward

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw the dark market price suddenly trend upward, with British and American gold pounds also rising by one yuan each. British gold notes remained unchanged, and the market price stood flat. American gold notes followed the upward trend, once reaching as high as 16.93 yuan, eventually settling at 16.88 yuan, a premium of 0.23 yuan compared to the previous day. This was due to rumors in the market about the upcoming opening of the new "Central Bank." The demand for Hong Kong notes suddenly became strong, and the price rose by one cent. Japanese gold notes gradually rebounded, and the evening market retreated to 1.575 yuan. Korean notes continued to rise sharply, reaching as high as 1.33 yuan in the evening market.

### Rumors Suddenly Arise, Gold Market Soars, Spot Price and Futures Converge, Swap Discount Around 10 Yuan

Yesterday's dark market for gold suddenly surged upward, with the price rising rapidly in the afternoon, flying to the 5,800 yuan mark, which was quite unexpected before this session's swap. It is widely rumored that the new "Central Bank" will open on the 5th of next month, and foreign exchange tightened amidst the panic of import firms, which stimulated the long-stagnant sentiment of all parties. The market opened stable in the morning, at 5,760 yuan, falling to 5,755 yuan. Although the bills from the exchange houses were cut short, another exchange house filled the gap, and its gold houses were inclined to advance, and the market trend turned firm and stable. In the afternoon, the rumor made foreign exchange tight, and the securities firms also turned, and the rising trend suddenly became sharp, flying out of 5,800 yuan, and seeing a high price of 5,812 yuan, eventually slightly returning to the 5,800 yuan mark, a surge of 46 yuan. The total daily transaction volume was 4,6700 taels, and the cash price and futures converged further. Initially, a cash house released dozens of taels to an exchange house, with the price 5 yuan lower than the futures. Then, a gold shop released 20 taels to an exchange house, only 1 yuan lower. Later, the gold shop industry released 100 taels to a small money shop, 3 yuan lower. Decorative gold and customs gold remained flat. Also, today is the third session of cash futures turning into the fourth session, and it is a Saturday holiday in the afternoon, so it will be held from 8:00 to 9:00 am. The buyer is still posting for the seller, and because it has been changed to extend the full month period, the premium is higher than the previous two sessions, reportedly around 20 yuan.

Dark Market at 800 Yuan

In the early morning, with the exchange market softening, the opening price was firm, with a gold house initially giving an exchange house 20 taels, at 5,760 yuan. Later, money exchange businesses slightly released, falling by 5 yuan, with a securities firm giving an exchange house 20 taels, at 5,755 yuan. Subsequently, the gold house strongly advanced, and a certain money exchange shop repurchased, raising it by 20 yuan, with a gold house advancing 20 taels to an exchange house, at 5,775 yuan. However, the securities firms were full of sincerity and came to the market to release, and the price fell again, with an exchange house releasing 20 taels to a money exchange business, at 5,762 yuan. At this time, the exchange house's short sellers began to cover, and the situation before the closing was expensive again, with a securities firm entering an exchange house 20 taels, at 5,772 yuan. The noon closing saw an exchange house release 10 taels to a securities firm, at 5,770 yuan. The late market was more active and the trading was also strong. Initially, the exchange house made a direct trade of 20 taels, at 5,775 yuan, and under the securities firm's purchase, it reached the 5,800 yuan mark, with a gold house entering a securities firm 20 taels, at 5,795 yuan. Subsequently, the money exchange business released 20 taels to the gold house, at 5,780 yuan. Soon there was a buying frenzy again, with gold houses and securities firms absorbing more, and a gold house entering an exchange house 20 taels, having gone out of the 800 yuan mark, estimated at 5,812 yuan. The evening closing saw an exchange house release 10 taels to a gold house, at 5,800 yuan, a surge of 46 yuan compared to the previous day. The daily fluctuation was 52 yuan. The selling price of the cash house's own brand gold was more than ten yuan higher than the dark market, and the purchase price was thirty yuan lower. The current marked gold was 5-60 yuan lower than the official gold price, but few trades were made.

Decorative Gold Holds Steady

The selling price of gold jewelry per tael has remained unchanged from beginning to end. Datonghanghang quoted 590 yuan, and Xintonghanghang's price was similar to the above price, with the purchase price about 20 yuan lower.

### Securities: Foreign Debt Surges, Intentions to Advance Take a Wait-and-See Attitude

London, 12th (Thursday) telegram, today's official market prices for Chinese foreign debt and Far East British merchant company stocks have returned to calm. Chinese bond prices have shown no gains or losses, but although the Shanghai side has strong intentions to advance, they are taking a wait-and-see attitude in view of the sharp rise in market prices. As a result, London's asking prices have been soft. The offering price of the Reorganization English issuance yesterday's telegram showed a drop of over four pounds, and Crisp and Daoqing each dropped about half a pound, only the British-French loan was slightly higher in line with the market, with a supply of 2-3,000 pounds. Recent transactions have also been dominated by the Reorganization, Beijing-Shanghai, Tianjin-Pukou, and Longhai bonds, which are slightly more active, and there have also been trades made in this city.

British merchant stocks, bank stocks have shown some improvement, the Macgregor Bank stock rose 5 shillings, the price is 8 pounds, HSBC Bank English registered stock rose 2 shillings 6 pence, the price is 78 pounds, and the Hong Kong registered stock rose 1 pound, the price is 81 pounds, it has a market but no sales, The Commercial Bank of China stock rose 2 shillings 6 pence, the price is 10 pounds 15 shillings, the rest remained unchanged.

The dark market for public debt was even more reduced and stagnant yesterday. Most households were taking a wait-and-see attitude. Such repeated hovering is not beneficial to the bulls. On the one hand, the burden of interest becomes heavier and heavier, and on the other hand, certain news brewing in the environment is said to be inevitable. A big rise and a small fall will occur after the payment of interest at the end of January next year. Yesterday's market was very quiet, and transactions were also very slow. Only 100,000 purchased from No. 64 were relatively more, and the purchases of Hengfu, Lianyi, Tongkang, etc. were also limited. Scattered retail investors were more active, and sellers Xinfu, Wuyuan, and calling numbers were more numerous, and the rest were very few. The market prices were still sticking to each other between five cents and one corner, and the result was only an increase or decrease of five cents. Ninety-six had recovered to a small quarter, and the total number of transactions totaled 8-900,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below.

For stock trading, 1,000 shares of Renyuan Real Estate Company shares were transacted at a price of 17.25 yuan. Yesterday's newspaper reported that securities trading would move to a certain trust company building next Monday to start trading. It is heard that public debt is still traded at the original location. It is heard that there are a few ambitious people who want to manipulate the stocks of Chinese merchants, and follow suit, so there is a saying that the market will open in a certain trust company building. Nowadays, people regard stocks as gambling, and if Chinese merchant stocks are exploited by speculators, it would be unpleasant. Let's see if this is true.

The stock market for various industries saw slightly more transactions, and the trend has also improved. Yinglian shares traded the most, the price of Yihua Brewery shares rose slightly, China Land Reclamation shares stood firmly at 24 yuan, and the Shanghai Handrong shares traded well, closing at 6.75 yuan. In summary, buyers often had the upper hand in daily transactions, and the potential of rubber shares was also very stable.

The board of directors of China Land Reclamation Co., Ltd., managed by McBain Foreign Firm, decided yesterday to pay the second interim dividend for 1940 on the 28th of this month, at 6 jiao per share.

### Yarn and Cotton: Buying Trend Suddenly Rises Near Noon, Double Horse Sees a New Peak, 1,307 Yuan

Yesterday's yarn market, which had been flat and tired for two days, was initially quite tired and even had a downward trend, mainly due to small actual sales and the strength of the previous day. However, it suddenly turned tense at the closing, and the momentum was unusually strong. This was because the general floating longs had settled clearly, and most had turned short. Unexpectedly, the foreign customers, seeing that the quota was dry and having hovered for two days, suddenly absorbed and added code at the closing. The scattered shorts were caught off guard and eager to make up, and the market rose rapidly, jumping up 20 yuan in an instant. In general, there is sufficient floating capital, and the selling price of 32-count single yarn is surprisingly expensive. At present, compared with the 10-count yarn price is relatively cheaper, which has attracted foreign customers to purchase. Today, there are 1,330 pieces of cotton yarn shipped to Hong Kong.

Double Horse opened in the morning, and the atmosphere in the afternoon of the previous day was slightly expensive, but there were quite a few shorts in the market who were thinking of selling stubbornly. The opening price was 1,277 yuan, still a small three yuan lower than the dark market price in the afternoon. At this time, the table was even more pretending to be foolish and dazed, but after inquiring, it was found that most of those stubbornly selling and looking down were in the majority. After a while, it rose slightly to 1,282 yuan, but the short side was still very active and fell to 1,175 yuan again. Then the long and short sides held their positions and hovered at 1,277-8 yuan for an hour. After 11 o'clock, the momentum gradually changed, advancing towards a tight and expensive trend. The telephones from the small silver houses were mostly for entering. In an instant, it went straight up to 1,293 yuan. At the close, someone wanted to enter at 1,296 yuan. According to the statistics of the daytime transactions, 5,200 bales were transacted. The行情 for 20-count Double Horse rose by 16 yuan. The amount of purchases by each gang is listed as follows, Hong Kong 200, counterparts 5,000, statistics 5,200.

The yarn market surged in the afternoon, and trading in the yarn and cloth exchange was extremely lively, discovering a new peak since February. 20-count Double Horse broke through 1,300 yuan, and has been made to 1,307 yuan, with transactions of one or two hundred bales.

### Cotton's Rising Trend Also Begins

The current cotton situation is trending firm, and the rising trend has also begun. This is because cotton yarn has risen sharply, causing the closely related raw cotton to follow suit. Factories' attitudes are gradually improving, and the industry's sentiment is becoming more bullish. However, continued overseas purchases are being established, and there are still no effective measures regarding domestic cotton sources.

Another report: Foreign cotton market prices, the New York cotton market, were slightly more active again yesterday. Industry transactions were still quite lively. Subsequently, due to predictions of adverse weather in the eastern cotton-growing region, the closing price rose two to three points compared to the seventh. Indian cotton, along with predictions, rose one rupee.

Shanghai's foreign cotton transactions have been quiet in recent days. Factory purchases are weak, while industry sentiment remains exceptionally high. Yesterday afternoon, exchange rates tightened slightly, and the cotton market became slightly more active, but there were still no large transactions.

### Bullish Views on Cotton Yarn Price Increases

In the past two weeks, the yarn market has shifted from weak to upward. It initially started because a large U.S. loan was successfully obtained, and people's minds relaxed. 20-count "Shuang Ma" (Double Horse) yarn fell to 1,207 yuan. Subsequently, as foreign traders considered shifting from gold to futures and foreign exchange was quiet, market prices were almost stagnant, with little fluctuation. Interest waned, so they changed their strategy and rushed into the cotton yarn market to speculate. Initially, industry insiders had ordinary thoughts because there was no special development in actual consumption and only released a small amount of yarn. Now, with the Southwest region successively demanding 32-count and 42-count fine yarn threads, the selling price naturally soared step by step. From this, sentiment suddenly changed direction, and the market moved forward. The author is in the market, hearing discussions. The following are some of the arguments for the rise in the yarn market for reference:

(1) Foreign traders argue that 20-count Double Horse yarn reached a peak of 1,302 yuan on October 22nd. The trend has reversed for more than two months. They also say that the prices of miscellaneous goods are uniformly rising, so they are very bullish on cotton yarn. Therefore, there are many opinions in the market, looking for new developments in the future, and buying is even more enthusiastic. The fundamental issue is still thinking about the consumption aspect.

(2) 32-count single yarn "Tian Nu" (Celestial Maiden) was priced at 1,380 yuan on November 1st. The current selling price is 1,610 yuan, a difference of 130 yuan. 20-count Double Horse yarn was priced at 1,220 yuan on the same day. The current selling price is 1,296 yuan, a difference of only 76 yuan, so buying is seen as expensive.

(3) Going forward, 20-count cotton yarn will soon be available on the market. Therefore, even though factories have released large quantities, they have all been absorbed by large players.

(4) Because 32-count and 42-count yarns are selling well, factories are short of supply and plan to convert spindles to spin finer yarns. In the future, the production of 20-count yarn will naturally decrease.

(5) However, the sales of 20-count yarn are not as strong as those of fine yarn. It is also impossible to only listen to one side. In short, there is an abundance of speculative capital, which easily leads to price increases. (Shan)

### Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth Firm and Upward in the Afternoon

The factory cloth market opened flat yesterday morning but suddenly rose firmly in the afternoon. This was because the cotton yarn black market surged sharply in the afternoon, and people's spirits were tense. Trading sentiment suddenly increased. Selling prices for coarse and fine cloth twills rose by 2.5 jiao per piece. Bleached and dyed cloth rose by 3.5 to 5 jiao. Factories gradually increased prices step by step. The street traded a total of several thousand pieces of various cloths. Guangdong and Hong Kong merchants added over 300 pieces of poplin, colored cloth, and colored twill cloth. Zhejiang Road, Wenzhou, and Ningbo merchants added over 110 pieces of bleached cloth, colored cloth, and twill. Fujian merchants added over 100 pieces of colored twill and blue cloth woolen fabric. Northern Road, Yantai, and Tianjin merchants added over 110 pieces of poplin and coarse cloth. Overseas, Siam, Little Luzon, and other places purchased over 2,000 bolts of khaki floral cloth.

Eastern cloth was weak in the morning and firm in the afternoon. The market outlook was bullish, and the rising trend of fine cloth was outstanding, gradually increasing. As a result, the price continued to rise by 3 to 4 jiao per piece. 12-pound "Dragon Head" fine cloth closed at 36.9 yuan, and "Four Gentlemen" serge at 1.11 yuan.

### Miscellaneous Grains: Non-Industry Speculators Hoarding Yellow Soybeans - How Can Supply Ever Be Exhausted?

Recently, the yellow soybean market situation has been lackluster and lacking in spirit due to slow delivery and sales. Yesterday's market, under the potential of continued increases in the oil market, attracted inquiries from general non-industry speculators, and market sentiment rose slightly. However, with the continuous supply and weak actual sales, the overall situation is unlikely to improve much. Yesterday, it was estimated that 1,300 units of Tianjin beans were traded, priced at 31 to 36.7 yuan; over 600 yuan of Qingdao beans, priced at 34.5 yuan; 400 bags of Guide beans, priced at 33.05 yuan; and over 4,000 bags of Jiujiang late beans, priced at 34.1 yuan.

Today, there are 875 bags of soybeans, 1,880 pieces of soybean cake, and 1,130 pieces of piece goods being shipped to Hong Kong.

### Sugar Market: Sugar Prices Continue to Rise Slightly

Yesterday's sugar market was firm due to Japanese merchants absorbing over 1,000 bags of Taikoo Granulated White B Mark, and the trend was stable, with continued slight increases. The association's market price for spot goods was 75.2 yuan at the warehouse for Second Grade Coarse White, 74.7 yuan outside the warehouse, 74.4 yuan for TCC Mark, 57.2 to 57.4 yuan for Dutch Red spot goods, up 0.2 yuan. End-of-month warehouse delivery orders were 57.6 to 57.8 yuan, with the same increase. Taikoo Granulated White B Mark was 73.8 to 74 yuan at the Western warehouse, up 0.2 yuan, 73.5 yuan at the Eastern warehouse, and 73.2 yuan for end-of-month delivery orders. DY Mark was 70 yuan at the Eastern warehouse, HX Mark was 70.2 yuan at the Western warehouse, up 0.4 yuan, and 69.9 yuan at the Eastern warehouse.

### North-South Goods: Dried Lily Flowers Rise Again

Dried lily flowers have risen again due to limited arrivals. Top-grade "Ding Zhuang" vegetables rose by 5 to 10 yuan, and "Gao Da Xing" rose by 4 to 5 yuan. The rise in price was similar for New Year goods from places like Jue Ru Xiang Zhuang and Suqian. Yesterday, 100+ packages were offered, and the market was quite tight.

Also, yesterday (the 13th), 456 boxes of longan were shipped from Xiamen.

### Hardware: Black Iron Billets in Considerable Quantity

The market price of 2,000-pound black iron billets varies greatly because there are few good products and many inferior ones. Recently, hot water bottle factories, furnace workshops, and other industries have been actively purchasing due to seasonal factors, and the volume is considerable. In addition, printing factories, mirror factories, and machinery factories also occasionally purchase, so the market is quite lively. Although merchants from other ports have not taken action, sentiment remains bullish, and asking prices remain firm and high. Yesterday's market price for 2,000 pounds of genuine bundled goods was 1,200 yuan, and inferior goods were sold for 1,000 yuan, ranging from zero to one hundred yuan.

### Shortage of Bamboo Joint Steel Bars

Bamboo joint steel bars are being actively purchased by construction workers and merchants from North China. Overseas sources remain scarce, and local inventories are limited. Currently, fine sizes of 3-4 fen are selling for 1,200 yuan per ton, up from 1,150 yuan. Coarse sizes of 5 fen to 1 cun are selling for 1,100 to 1,150 yuan per ton.

### Coal: Strong Demand for White Coal Dust Leads to Uniform Price Increases

Since the price of new "Hongji No. 2" white coal dust increased, other inferior goods have also risen in price. It is said that He Lin dust, which a certain foreign firm recently procured from Taiwan, has also been jointly distributed by the industry due to shipping costs, increasing from 80 yuan to 100 yuan per ton, an increase of 20 yuan. This shows the strong demand for raw materials from coal briquette factories, with demand exceeding supply.

### Gradual Relaxation of West Shanghai Blockade: Rumors of Imminent Japanese Military Withdrawal; Great Western Road and Route Tenant De Veaux Already Reopened; Negotiations on Rickshaw License Issues Pending

According to semi-official sources yesterday, the blockade of West Shanghai is expected to be lifted soon, perhaps within three days. The intensity of the blockade had already begun to ease yesterday. Route Tenant De Veaux and Great Western Road, previously only accessible to foreigners, had a passage opened on the eastern side from the morning of the 12th, specifically for pedestrians. Three Japanese military police and two Chinese auxiliary police were stationed there. However, Chinese people entering and exiting were subject to searches by the Japanese military police. Because the general public was not informed in advance, the number of people passing through was not crowded, with only nearby residents using this route. Route Tenant De Veaux on Jing'an Temple Road remained blocked and unopened. However, the number of guards stationed there had increased from five or six auxiliary police to two Japanese military police, possibly in preparation for opening a breach. Only Westerners and Shanghai Municipal Council students were allowed to enter and exit through the breach at the Paramount on Yu Yuan Road. Near Zhujiazhai on Route Haig, there was also a small path leading to Great Western Road, so pedestrians from Qianjia Lane on Route Yih Ting Pan were no longer as crowded as before. Food has been allowed into the blocked area, and many butcher shops and food stores have reopened. Rickshaws are required to pay a "license fee" to the so-called "West Shanghai Transportation Committee" before being allowed to travel in West Shanghai.

Loss of Contact for British Motor Buses

The barbed wire frame at the intersection of Great Western Road and Route Yih Ting Pan (on the northern side) has been removed, while the Route Yih Ting Pan intersection on the southern side has been completely blocked, preventing pedestrians and vehicles from entering or exiting. Reliable sources indicate that this measure is not being taken for the purpose of searching for "criminals," but rather to further suppress the business of British Shanghai Municipal Council buses. This is because the route of the British No. 7 bus line is the same as the "No. 1" route of the so-called "West Shanghai Citizen's Bus." Residents of the International Settlement, wanting to go to the vicinity of Route Yih Ting Pan and areas further west, would rather take the No. 7 bus via Route Haig, rather than take the Japanese bus. With this blockade, the Japanese bus can monopolize business. As a result, the British buses have completely lost contact with all routes in the West Shanghai blockade zone.

Searches Continue on Route Yih Ting Pan Yesterday

A large number of Japanese military police continued to patrol and search the "blockade zone" next to Route Yih Ting Pan yesterday (the 13th). However, the Japanese authorities continued to ease the restrictions imposed on the area. From the night of the 12th, the Japanese military police had removed the obstacles between Great Western Road and Yu Yuan Road, and the curfew previously imposed in the area from 8 pm every night had also been lifted. Officials stated yesterday morning that the restrictions in the area are expected to be completely lifted today (the 14th) or by the end of next week. However, it is unclear whether the Japanese military police have "completed" their investigation of the so-called "terrorist dens" next to Route Yih Ting Pan. It is believed that several people have been arrested, but Japanese officials have not issued any statements on this matter. Yesterday morning, the Japanese military police in the blockade zone only allowed silver taxis to travel on Yu Yuan Road. Taxis from other companies were not allowed to pass through, for reasons unknown. Japanese buses continued to travel to and from the Western District yesterday. The Shanghai Municipal Council protested this to the Japanese Consulate in Shanghai this week, but has not yet received a response.

Compulsory License Fees Awaiting Report

Regarding the "Municipal Government's" ban on rickshaws from the Shanghai International Settlement entering the extra-settlement roads in West Shanghai, the Shanghai Municipal Council authorities are still investigating. However, it is generally reported that a small number of rickshaws obtained "registration" from the "Municipal Police Bureau" yesterday. Rickshaws from the International Settlement are still not allowed to enter the extra-settlement roads, and Chinese auxiliary police continue to guard the entrances of alleys leading to the extra-settlement roads. According to a Shanghai Municipal Council spokesperson to reporters yesterday, the police authorities investigating the matter have not yet submitted the full report to the Shanghai Municipal Council. The spokesperson continued that the Shanghai Municipal Council cannot definitively state whether it will lodge a protest with the "Municipal Government" before receiving this report, and whether private chartered cars traveling in the extra-settlement roads will be subject to the same restrictions. There was no definite news on this matter yesterday.

30,000 Rickshaw Pullers Will Be Affected

However, rickshaw pullers told reporters that they had seen dozens of Chinese auxiliary police writing down the numbers of cars that had not yet obtained "municipal licenses." About 10,000 rickshaws were subject to this restriction, affecting about 30,000 rickshaw pullers. Furthermore, reporters learned that a certain party's attempt has been completely materialized. Rickshaws have been found on Great Western Road and Yu Yuan Road in the blockade zone. These vehicles all have the words "Specially Approved by the West Shanghai Transportation Committee" pasted on the back. The alleys in the middle of Route Yih Ting Pan between Yu Yuan Road and Great Western Road, on the eastern side, remain blocked as before, and are still under strict search by the Japanese military police.

### Over One Hundred American Missionaries to Return to the US by Year's End

Another Batch Has Already Arrived in Shanghai, Preparing to Leave China by Ship Next Spring

Over one hundred American missionaries and their families from the occupied areas of China will board the President Coolidge in Shanghai on the 31st of this month, heading back to the United States. According to the American President Lines, a total of one hundred and forty people have booked economy class tickets on the President Coolidge in Shanghai, eighty of whom are American missionaries. It is reported that dozens of other American missionaries from the interior have now arrived in Shanghai, preparing to depart on other ships early next year. Many major missionaries in the interior, who originally did not heed the US State Department's advice to evacuate American nationals from the Far East unless absolutely necessary, have recently changed their minds and are advising their missionaries to leave the country. Therefore, the number of American evacuees has increased sharply. Yesterday, rumors circulated that American nationals in the Hankou area would be "evacuated en masse," but the American consulate said that this statement was a gross exaggeration. Over the past three years, the number of American nationals in the Hankou area has been greatly reduced. Although a small number of American nationals in the area are still evacuating, it is definitely not a total evacuation.

### Beggar Asylum to Open on New Year's Day

Estimated to Have Twenty-Four Rooms; Additional Construction Can Be Added at Any Time

According to sources from the Salvation Army, the beggar asylum being built by the Army on Singapore Road is expected to open its doors on New Year's Day to accommodate the poor. The asylum has a total of twenty-four wooden rooms, six of which have already been completed, with the rest under rapid construction. If the number of beggars admitted at the time of opening is too large and there is insufficient accommodation, additional wooden rooms can be added on the vacant land next to the asylum, which will take a short amount of time. The asylum is the first step in the active relief of beggars by Shanghai charities, and they will be taught handicrafts and business skills so that they can become self-reliant. It is heard that the Salvation Army is paying special attention to beggars addicted to drugs, and it is expected that the asylum's medical staff will carefully treat beggars addicted to opium and those who are ill, sparing no effort.

### North-China Daily News Staff Go on Strike

Labor and Management Are in Negotiations; Publication Continues as Usual Today

Over three hundred employees of the English-language North-China Daily News in Shanghai suddenly went on strike at around 10 am yesterday, causing the newspaper's afternoon extra edition to fail to be published as scheduled. It is understood that the newspaper's dispatch and typesetting workers, along with other Chinese staff, had recently found life difficult and had submitted a list of twelve demands to the newspaper's management on the 11th of this month, including an increase in wages and allowances. The most important of these was an increase of one shi of rice per person, and they requested that the newspaper's management respond within forty-eight hours. By 10 am yesterday, the employees had not received a response and immediately went on strike, leaving the newspaper office. At around 11 am, two representatives from the employees' side met with the newspaper's manager, Marris, and others to hold initial negotiations. The employer had agreed to increase each person's rice by six dou and two and a half sheng, and had also agreed to a small portion of the other demands. However, the employees were not satisfied.

It was also learned last night that, although the North-China Daily News was affected by the Chinese staff's strike, it was still publishing as usual today for the convenience of readers. However, due to the reduced number of workers, the quality of the paper and its materials may not be as high as usual. As for how this labor unrest will be resolved, there was no definite news as of midnight yesterday.

### Increase in Shanghai Municipal Council Rates Seems Inevitable, but Subject to Approval by Taxpayers' Meeting Next Year; Current Deficit to Be Covered by Bank Loans

Since the Shanghai Municipal Council implemented a large increase in the number of Chinese police officers and the cost of living allowances for its Chinese and foreign staff, its financial situation has inevitably become difficult, greatly exceeding this year's budget. A Pingming News Agency reporter specifically inquired about this issue yesterday with those familiar with the Shanghai Municipal Council's financial situation. It was said that the Shanghai Municipal Council has increased its monthly expenditure by about 935,000 yuan since implementing the increase in cost of living allowances. Therefore, the Shanghai Municipal Council has begun planning to increase municipal taxes.

No Increase in Rates for the Kechun Seasons

If the Shanghai Municipal Council intends to make up for the deficit by increasing rates, it will have to wait until the annual taxpayers' meeting in April next year. This is because the Shanghai Municipal Council must submit any increase in rates to the annual taxpayers' meeting for approval before it can be implemented. Therefore, there is no risk of an increase in municipal rates this winter or next spring. As for the rumors that the Shanghai Municipal Council may increase municipal rates by 50% or 30%, it is too early to say at this time.

A Solution Has Been Found for the Current Emergency

Since the Shanghai Municipal Council cannot increase rates before the annual taxpayers' meeting in April next year, the current deficit, which is estimated to be 5.78 million yuan from November this year to the end of April next year, can be covered by the Shanghai Municipal Council using some of its remaining funds. In addition, it can also overdraw 3 million to 4 million yuan from the British HSBC Bank to make up for the shortfall.

### Japanese Monopolize Use of Shanghai-Japan Submarine Cable; Great Northern Telegraph Company to Cease Sending Telegrams to Japan and Other Places from Next Year

According to the English-language Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury, the Japanese Ministry of Communications has recently decided to monopolize the Sino-Japanese telecommunications business, and from January 1, 1934, will prohibit the Great Northern Telegraph Company from using its Shanghai-Nagasaki submarine cable to transmit telegrams. According to the company, after January 1 next year, telegrams sent from China (excluding Macau and Hong Kong) to Japan or "Manchukuo" will be prohibited, and therefore the company can no longer accept telegrams from China to Japan or "Manchukuo." Other telegrams can still be sent by the company as usual. The Great Northern Telegraph Company, established by the Danish, was founded in 1870, making it, along with the British-established Eastern Telegraph Company, one of the earliest telegraph companies in the Far East.

### Coal Price Reduction Agreed Upon

Negotiated by Mr. Huang Yuzhai, Decision Made to Reduce Price by One Yuan per Ton

Bathhouses in the city have been burdened by the increase of 20 yuan per ton in transportation costs for the fifth phase of subsidized coal, and have requested the help of Huang Yuzhai, chairman of the Bathhouse Association. Huang has repeatedly pleaded with the Kailan Mining Administration, asking them to consider the difficulties of businesses, and has made a unanimous request on behalf of the city's boiling water industry. It is now heard that the Kailan Mining Administration and the Coal Industry Association have agreed to provide assistance and accept the request, deciding to reduce the price by five yuan, bringing the total to 70 yuan per ton. The subsidized coal dregs will be sold soon, which is fortunate for both the bathhouse and boiling water industries. It is heard that members of both industries are extremely grateful for this move by Kailan and Huang.

### Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Food Committee Denies Restriction on Saigon Rice Shipments; 120,000 Bags Expected to Arrive in Shanghai This Month; Siamese Rice Can Also Be Procured, No Need to Worry Excessively

According to a spokesperson for the Shanghai Municipal Council yesterday, rice ordered from Vietnam before November 26 will still be shipped out, and it is believed that Saigon rice will continue to arrive. Rumors that no Saigon rice will be shipped to Shanghai until February of next year are just "alarmist" messages spread by others. Even if Shanghai has no Saigon rice available, it can also be procured from Rangoon, so there is absolutely no reason to panic about the food supply in Shanghai. This morning (the 13th), rice prices in the city are stable, which is enough to reflect that there is no rice shortage.

No Restrictions Imposed

Mr. Du Buxian, chairman of the Food Committee of the French Municipal Council, stated that more than 200,000 bags of Saigon rice (100 kg per bag) will be imported into Shanghai this month. The first batch of 80,000 bags was shipped a few days ago by the French postal ship D'Artagnan. Yesterday afternoon, Mr. Du received journalists and firmly denied the report that Saigon had banned the shipment of rice to Shanghai. Mr. Du said that Saigon had not implemented such restrictions. Mr. Du continued that the harvest there is expected to be even more satisfactory.

A Misunderstanding

Also, the spokesperson for the Shanghai Municipal Council believes that the report in a certain evening newspaper that a member of the Vietnamese delegation, on his way to Japan, declared that Saigon rice would be banned from export is an exaggeration. The spokesperson believes that the report in that evening newspaper must be a misunderstanding.

French Consul's Measures

According to Havas News Agency, French Consul General Magery, taking advantage of the opportunity of the Vietnamese economic delegation's visit to Japan, asked the delegation for its opinion on the matter. After careful study by the delegates over the past 48 hours, the economic delegation will work closely with the Vietnamese government in the future to find a solution that will suit the interests of the Shanghai public. In addition, the majority of the delegates are very familiar with this issue, so they can study it more thoroughly. The delegation declared that the claim that the Vietnamese authorities intend to ban the shipment of rice to Shanghai is inaccurate, and said that there is absolutely no such intention.

### Chinese United Amusement Association Distributes Steamed Bun Coupons

Charity Association Seeks Donations of Winter Clothing; Those Receiving Clothing Should Apply Quickly

The Shanghai Office of the Chinese Children's Charity Association has launched a campaign to solicit donations of winter clothing for poor children throughout the city, and has already received over 15,000 yuan in donations. It is still actively soliciting donations from people from all walks of life. Poor families who are requesting winter clothing for their children can apply to the association, fill out the application form, and receive winter clothing after verification. The association also hopes that people from all walks of life will assist in the widespread distribution of winter clothing. If you find poor children on the street who are in need of winter clothing, you can tell them to go directly to the association (Room 208, China Exchange Building, Avenue Edward VII) to apply, or write down their name, age, and address and send it to the association to apply on their behalf.

Distributing Steamed Bun Coupons

The Relief Section of the Welfare Committee of the Chinese United Amusement Association, in view of the difficult lives of the poor, has raised funds from members of the association, such as Mr. Qian Qiling, to issue steamed bun coupons. Each book contains fifty coupons, and each coupon is good for two steamed buns. Coupon holders can go to the steamed bun shops at 17 Xin Kai He Road, 418 Jiujiang Road, 20 Chongqing Road, 26 Bali Bridge Road, 265 Rue Lafayette, and 880 Tiantong Road to redeem them. If people from all walks of life wish to entrust distribution, please call 16129 and they can also be delivered on your behalf.

Providing Free Medical Treatment and Medicine

In addition, the association's affiliated Chinese United Clinic will continue to provide free medical treatment and medicine for four months starting this month, and has printed medical treatment and medicine coupons to distribute to the poor. Patients can go to the association's clinic with the coupons for free treatment. The time is set from 2 pm to 5 pm every day, except for Sundays, when the clinic is closed. Nine famous doctors in the city, such as Zhao Huairen, will take turns providing voluntary medical treatment.

### British Residents in Shanghai Donate Generously for Christmas; A Substantial Sum Received

A Total of Over Three Thousand Five Hundred Pounds Received; Already Remitted to the Central Army, Navy, and Air Force

The British residents in Shanghai have donated a total of 3,520 pounds and 11 pence for Christmas cheer. 875 pounds have already been remitted to the British Navy, Army, Air Force, and Allied Forces. The remaining 20 pounds and 11 pence will be remitted to Singapore to cheer up the soldiers of the former West Yorkshire Regiment and East Surrey Regiment stationed in Shanghai.

### Treatment of Chinese Police in the French Concession; Principles Already Decided; To Be Similar to That of Chinese Police in the International Settlement; Details Awaiting Discussion, Not Announced Yesterday

The French Concession Police Department has been very concerned about the lives of all Chinese police officers in this time of high prices, and has long been preparing to increase the allowances and improve the treatment of Chinese police officers. However, because it is related to the entire budget and the details in the method need to be considered, it takes time. Therefore, it was scheduled to be announced on the 13th. According to reports, the method was not announced yesterday, but may be officially announced today.

General Method

According to reliable sources, there is a considerable increase in the method. It is said that the allowances for Chinese police officers have been greatly increased, from 70% to 140%. Special labor fees will be increased from 6 yuan to 25 yuan. The minimum salary for each Chinese police officer will be about 109 yuan, which is comparable to the treatment of Chinese police officers in the International Settlement. It is also learned that the French Police Superintendent Faber has been very sympathetic to this increase in allowances for Chinese police officers, so he has repeatedly requested the Municipal Council, which ultimately led to a satisfactory result.

Can Be Resolved Immediately

Regarding the Chinese police in the French Concession's request for improved treatment, there was no response as of 5 pm yesterday. In order to resolve the incident as soon as possible, the Chinese police are expected to send a delegation to the French side at 9 am today to submit a memorandum requesting a scheduled and quick response. According to yesterday's news, some of the seventeen clauses submitted by the Chinese police have been decided, and are generally the same as the method decided by the International Settlement. It is heard that the remaining clauses still need to be reviewed and decided by the French authorities, and it is not known when they will be promulgated.

### Jianghai Customs to Improve the Treatment of All Tax Police

The monthly salaries of all tax police in the Jianghai Customs were originally very low. For those who have served for a full year, the salary increase is only one yuan. Recently, due to the high cost of goods, life is difficult. All tax police have elected representatives to visit the Customs Commissioner, Mr. Luo Fude, and jointly submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance, requesting that the monthly salaries of all tax police be increased to be equal to that of the employees of the Shanghai Postal Administration. According to reports, the customs authorities now believe that the points made by the tax police are reasonable. It is heard that, within the scope of financial possibilities, in accordance with the National Government's order, the salaries of all low-ranking civil servants will be increased and improved starting next year.

### United Medical Relief of China, Third Bowl of Rice Movement, Banquet and Dance Held in New York, Over Two Thousand People Attended, Dr. Hu Shih and Dr. Lin Yutang Gave Wonderful Speeches

The first dinner dance and variety show of the United Medical Relief of China's third Bowl of Rice movement in the United States this year was held on the evening of November 1 at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City. Other cities are also preparing and will follow suit one by one soon. It is reported that the entire movement will not be completed until mid-February next year. The grand occasion of the New York City conference that evening is revealed below:

The Grand Dinner

The dinner was the first event of the evening and was held in the Starlight Roof dining room of the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. Approximately 500 Western guests attended the dinner, accompanied by ten Chinese women at each table, all dressed in formal attire and well-mannered. In addition, the dining room was brightly lit with candles, crossed flags, floating silk banners, sparkling jewels, and shining walls. Fine wine and delicious food were enjoyed with great excitement. As the dinner was coming to an end, the president of the association, Mr. Luo, stood up and announced several telegrams from within the country, the most important of which was a telegram from the Chinese Red Cross reporting that "Although the Burma Road has recently been heavily bombed, it has not suffered major damage, and munitions and medicines can pass through safely." Everyone in attendance was overjoyed and gratified to hear this.

Dr. Hu Shih's Speech

As soon as the dinner ended, President Luo first invited Dr. Lin Yutang to give a speech. Dr. Lin is known for his eloquence and humorous language, and said that in many ways, the final victory belongs to us. After Lin Yutang, the speakers included the great French playwright Benes Jew and Ms. Thomson, a writer for the New York People's Forum. Both praised China's brave fighting and expressed that China's final victory was assured. Finally, the chairman invited Ambassador Hu to give a speech, and everyone stood up to pay their respects. The speech was met with applause from beginning to end. Ambassador Hu first praised the American people's aid to China, which was purely out of a genuine sympathy and without other motives mixed in, making it a valuable and unshakable force of assistance. He then explained the reasons why China is continuing the war and hopes that the United States will provide even stronger assistance.

The Scene at the Dance

After the dinner, everyone moved to the Emerald Room ballroom of the hotel to participate in dancing and watch performances. The dance floor included those who had attended the dinner, with a total of over 2,000 people. On the left and right sides of the music stage, there was an American flag and a Chinese flag hanging. In the middle of the stage, space was left for dancing. The surrounding area was lined with long tables and chairs for guests to rest. The two floors above were all private boxes. Looking up, the walls were all Chinese silk banners. There were countless young beauties in the room selling parts, making you feel as if you were at home. In the box that hosted Ambassador Hu, the flags of China, the United States, and the United Kingdom were hung high. The representative sent by the British Ambassador's Office also sat in the box.

Wonderful Performances

At midnight, the dance was temporarily suspended and the performances began. The star Anna May Wong served as the host. (1) Ms. Lucy's White-Clad Guanyin Dance, (2) Mr. La Lai's harmonica solo, (3) Ms. Ming Jiaobuyushi's Qing Song, (4) Chinese ancient costume performance, (5) fan dance performed by more than 20 Chinese girls, (6) Chinese acrobatics performed by Wang Zhao, (7) Ms. Li Lianai's sword dance, (8) New Mexican dance by Rosa and Anthony. Finally, in the costume performance, star Anna May Wong was publicly elected as queen from more than a dozen people, and the famous painter Lavar volunteered to paint her portrait. The meeting did not gradually disperse until 3 am. The results of this decision are very impressive.

### All Entertainment Venues in Hongkou to Be Closed

Japanese Consul General Undertaking Purge; but Bad Habits Are Difficult to Eradicate

According to Japanese official sources in Shanghai, it is expected that the Japanese Consul General in Shanghai, Horiuchi, will soon order all nighttime entertainment venues in Hongkou to close. Therefore, the Japanese who operate bars and dance halls in Shanghai are all worried. Last year, when Horiuchi was the Consul General in Tianjin, he implemented a widespread moral movement among the Japanese residents in Tianjin, ordering all Japanese-owned nighttime entertainment venues in that city to close.

It is heard that the Japanese Consulate Police Department has begun "preparations" for a purge of bad habits in Hongkou, and is strictly investigating the Japanese residents and their business operations in the area. As for whether the entertainment venues run by German Jews in the area will also be affected by the Japanese authorities' decision to close the nighttime entertainment venues in Hongkou, Japanese officials could not say for sure, but said that it was very possible. This is because Japan has banned the people from "wasting time and money." If the Japanese authorities close the Japanese-owned nighttime entertainment venues but not those run by foreigners, it would be unfair, since the Japanese residents could still go to foreign-owned entertainment venues to enjoy themselves, which would only cause losses to the Japanese businesses. When asked whether the Japanese authorities are carrying out a

Purge Movement

in Hongkou, will they carry out the same activities in other areas of Shanghai, especially with the aim of purging gambling dens, it was answered that it was very possible. Horiuchi intends to remove all "bad habit elements" from Hongkou, but it is heard that the bad habits have existed for a long time, and it may not be easy to curb them. The Japanese authorities' decision to close the nighttime entertainment venues in Hongkou will affect more than 20,000 people. There are also a large number of Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and European people who make a living from the existence of these venues.

### Belgian Ambassador Leaves Shanghai for Beijing

The Belgian Ambassador to China, Mr. Guillaume, had been away from Shanghai for a long time, and the important official duties of the embassy required him to personally handle them in Shanghai. Therefore, he came to Shanghai from Beijing in mid-October and has been here for more than a month. In addition to going to the embassy every day to handle official duties, the ambassador rarely socialized with outsiders. Now that the backlog of official duties has been largely cleared, he left Shanghai for Beijing last week. It is heard that Ambassador Guillaume has few days left in the year, so after arriving in Beijing, he does not intend to go to Chongqing. He will spend the New Year in Beijing and wait until mid-January next year before going to Chongqing to visit the main people in the central government. After staying in Chongqing for a month, the ambassador will come to Shanghai again in the warm spring breeze.

### US Court Judge Scheduled to Go to Tianjin to Hear Cases

Hearing Cases Involving American Nationals in North China

According to the English-language Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury, according to news today (the 13th), US Court Judge to China, Hale Meek, will leave Shanghai for Tianjin on Tuesday (the 17th) to hear cases involving American nationals there for two weeks. Hale told people that there were quite a few cases waiting to be heard there. It is an annual routine for Hale to go to North China to hear cases involving American nationals there.

### Shanghai Hotel Industry to Raise Prices Again Tomorrow

The local hotel industry association previously raised prices by 30% due to soaring commodity prices in Shanghai. Yesterday, it was reported that the association had recently convened a meeting and resolved to further increase prices by 20%, effective tomorrow (the 15th).

### Memorial Service for Botanist Zhong Xianchang

Zhong Guangwang, courtesy name Xianchang, was born in the late Qing Dynasty. He was deeply versed in Chinese classical studies, possessed unique insights, and co-founded the Science Instrument Museum in Shanghai with his comrades, pioneering new trends. Later, he specialized in botany, teaching in normal schools across various provinces. He traveled extensively throughout Yunnan, Guizhou, You, and Yan, collecting over 16,000 species of rare and unusual plants. His book, "Chinese Botany," was thus extensively compiled, possessing the breadth of the "Compendium of Materia Medica" while eliminating its complexity. In 1937, while in Beiping, the Lugouqiao Incident occurred. Knowing he could not remain, he returned to his hometown through roundabout routes. Unexpectedly, news of his death arrived. He passed away on September 30th of the lunar calendar in his hometown. Friends in Shanghai have scheduled a memorial service on January 3rd of the 30th year, from 2:00 PM to 6:00 PM, at the Ningbo Association in Shanghai, located on Yu Qiaqing Road. They will collect funds to publish his posthumous works for wider circulation.

### Wu Leyi to Perform Famous Piano Concertos

Special Engagement by the Municipal Council String Orchestra. The Municipal Council String Orchestra is scheduled to hold a concert at the Lyceum Theatre at 5:15 PM on Sunday, the 15th of this month. Ms. Wu Leyi has been specially engaged to perform famous piano concertos. It is said that Ms. Wu has collaborated with the orchestra ten times. Not counting previous occasions, this is her third performance this year, which is truly commendable. It is understood that the concerto to be performed is Liszt's Piano Concerto No. 1 in E Major. A grand occasion is guaranteed. All music lovers are encouraged to attend. Tickets can be reserved at the Lyceum Theatre. The left photo is a recent portrait of Ms. Wu.

### In Memory of Mr. Zhang Shanzi

(I) Exemplary Artist by Ya Chen

[Image: Zhang Shanzi's posthumous portrait]

Mr. Zhang Shanzi passed away in Chongqing on October 20th. I learned of this sad news on the morning of October 21st while reading the Shanghai newspaper. At first, I doubted the accuracy of the telegram, but it was confirmed three days later. This is another loss of a strong general in our Chinese art world. I met Shanzi in the autumn of 1919 at his residence in Xicheng Lane, Ximen Road, where a painting exhibition of the Dafeng Hall collection was held. At that time, Shanzi's tiger paintings were already famous. He was sincere to his friends, meticulous in his work, enthusiastic about public welfare, and diligent in his painting, making him one of the people I admired most.

In 1926, the Xinhua Art Academy was established, and Shanzi served as the director of the Chinese painting department, providing the greatest assistance to Xinhua. In 1930, when I returned to China from Europe, Shanzi was one of the art patrons. At that time, when discussing the attitude towards art, he once said to me:

"Art is a lifelong career, without end. One must bury oneself in hard work for decades before one can speak of creation. Painting, whether Chinese or Western, is originally a product of human thought and technique. Without achieving the skill of realism and photorealism, how can one talk about creation?"

Including myself, there were eight willing horses in the Chinese Painting Association (namely Shanzi, Xiao Jian, Hu Fan, Wu Chang, Tian Jian, Qing Qing, Qing Zeng, and Ya Chen). Shanzi was twelve years older than the seven of us, so we called him "Old Big Brother." His understanding of art resonated deeply with me. From 1931 to this day, I have always used Shanzi's words as my motto.

"An artist must not cease striving until his art startles the world." Shanzi achieved this, and he can indeed serve as an excellent role model for all those engaged in art. The world has its own assessment of Shanzi's art, and I dare not say more. In short, his diligence and courage in art, his generosity and gentleness in personality, left us comrades with an excellent impression. It has been said that painters live long lives. Conversely, one might say: "Those who die young rarely achieve mastery." Shanzi was fifty-nine years old this year, which cannot be considered a short life. If heaven had granted him more years, his accomplishments would have reached the pinnacle of perfection.

(II) Recording Events in the Master's Garden by Chou Cheng

Mr. Zhang Shanzi, a famous Chinese painter, recently returned from abroad with honors but fell ill due to overwork and passed away in Chongqing on October 20th of this year. When the sad news arrived, everyone, whether they knew him or not, mourned him.

Mr. Zhang was good at painting tigers. In the Master of Nets Garden in Suzhou, there were real tigers. On January 2, 1937, Mr. Hu Guigeng of Tiger Brand Yung An Tang Shanghai Branch and Mr. Xu Guanqun of Sin Asia Pharmaceutical Factory entertained members of the Shanghai New Pharmaceutical Industry Association and pharmaceutical experts from Beijing and Shanghai, visiting his place during a trip to Suzhou. Upon entering, they saw the tigers raised by Mr. Zhang were not caged but lying on the main road. Hearing us enter, the tigers stared intently. The timid ones hesitated to move forward. Mr. Zhang explained that the tigers' wild nature had been tamed and stroked the tigers' heads to show their docility, so they dared to enter the garden. Then, all the people present wished to take a photo with the tigers as a memento. I squatted opposite a tiger as if in conversation.

Then Mr. Zhang showed us his painting "Eight Horses," which was as tall as the eaves, immensely large, and each horse had a different posture, all lively and spirited.

At noon, we had a banquet in the garden. The dishes were prepared by Mr. Zhang's family under his direction, completely in Sichuan style, with a unique flavor. Some of the dishes had never been eaten in Shanghai Sichuan restaurants, so everyone praised them endlessly. After the meal, we all went to the poolside in the garden and took a group photo. This scene is still vivid in my mind.

Now, Mr. Hu and Mr. Xu, together with the painters, have initiated a public memorial service on the 15th of this month, requesting me to invite those who traveled to Suzhou at that time to participate together to fulfill our friendship. In addition to sending out separate invitations, I am recording the details of the trip to the Master of Nets Garden three years ago to express my condolences.

### Japanese Residents' Election for Municipal Council Director: Prospects Extremely Dim

### Leaders' Selfishness Has Caused Internal Strife

### Lack of Familiarity with Concession Administration

A well-known Japanese businessman who has resided in Shanghai for a long time confided to a reporter of the English-language "China Press" the day before yesterday (the 12th) that Japanese residents in Shanghai have already begun their campaign for the next term of the Municipal Council director, hoping to win. However, the progress of the campaign is poor, and those leading the campaign are trying to seize dictatorial power for themselves, leading to internal strife.

Seeking Election is Seeking Trouble

Japanese residents regularly hold meetings to discuss the election campaign, but they are plagued by conflicts among the leaders. Therefore, the results achieved so far are far from satisfactory. He believes that in the Municipal Council director election in January next year, the number of votes from Japanese residents should easily overwhelm other foreigners, or at least the difference in votes should be very small, certainly not as large as the discrepancy this year. However, most Japanese residents are not familiar with the actual situation of the Public Concession, such as the rampant crime and the "bankrupt" state of the Municipal Council. Therefore, if Japanese residents win next year's election, they will be seeking trouble for themselves.

Failure Would Damage Reputation

It would be best for Japanese residents to operate their businesses in the Public Concession and continue to support the position of British and American individuals in the Municipal Council. Today, the number of votes for Japanese residents has greatly increased compared to those participating in the election this year, and they are trying to win a majority of the Municipal Council seats next year. However, it is not impossible to repeat this year's failure. If that is the case, the reputation of Japanese residents here will naturally be affected. On the other hand, if Japanese residents provide normal assistance to British and American residents who deserve to be elected, the solution to the current difficulties will be closer at hand. At the same time, British, American, and Japanese residents can be friendly and harmonious.

### Director of American Chemical Plant Convicted of Embezzlement

### Civil Suit to be Heard by Immigration Court

Qian Bozhong, director of the American Chemical Industrial Raw Material Plant at No. 51, Lane 1465, Huade Road, colluded with administrator Cai Funen to embezzle thousands of dollars in goods and funds since October 27th of this year. Fearing that shareholders would check the accounts, he instigated others to commit arson three times, intending to burn the goods. All attempts failed. Shareholder Tan Deren discovered this and reported it to the police, who arrested and escorted them to the First Special Court. After a lawful trial, a judgment was proposed yesterday morning: Qian Bozhong was sentenced to one year of imprisonment for continuously embezzling items held in his professional capacity and six months of imprisonment for instigating arson of buildings, with a combined sentence of one year and two months of imprisonment. Cai Funen was fined one hundred yuan for embezzlement. The ancillary civil suit will be heard by the Immigration Court.

### Several Robbers Sentenced to Imprisonment

### Guns and Ammunition Confiscated

Sun Rubao, a robber from Jiangbei, also known as Xiao Erzi, 19 years old, colluded with fleeing accomplice Ma Changsheng on the 28th of last month at 1:00 PM, each wielding a handgun, to intercept pedestrian Cao Dexiang on Xinzha Road Lane 1492, robbing him of his coat and watch. In a desperate situation, Cao called for help. Chinese Constable No. 292, residing in the lane, rushed out to assist. Sun then drew his gun and fired at the Chinese constable. Fortunately, the bullet was jammed and failed to fire. The Chinese constable bravely captured him and handed him over to the Gordon Road Police Station for investigation. He was sent to the First Special Court and prosecuted for attempted murder and robbery. Special Judge Huang concluded the trial, and the judgment was proposed yesterday morning: "Main Text" Sun Rubao (i.e., Xiao Erzi) is a recidivist of armed robbery and sentenced to six years of imprisonment. Other charges are not guilty. One handgun and four bullets are confiscated.

Robbers Chen Fusheng and Shen Asan from Jiangxi colluded with others on the 1st of last month, armed and invading No. 5, Lane 307, North Zhejiang Road, to rob property. Because the victim, Xu Chenshi, resisted, her head and back were struck four times. As a result, Chen and others were surrounded and arrested by detectives, and a Mauser gun was confiscated and sent to the First Special Court for detention. A formal prosecution for attempted murder and robbery was proposed yesterday morning. The victim, Xu Chenshi, has not yet recovered from her injuries and cannot appear in court to testify. The court ordered a postponement until the victim recovers and the trial will resume.

Robber Lu Wenbin and others from Songjiang specialized in committing armed robberies in Hongkou. They were arrested by the Yulin Road Police Station in the middle of last month and sent to the First Special Court. They were prosecuted for robbery by a gang of three or more people. The trial has been concluded by Special Judge Chuan in a special court. The judgment was proposed yesterday morning: Lu Wenbin, a recidivist gang of armed robbers, is sentenced to eight years of imprisonment; Jin Kerong, six years of imprisonment; Hu Xiaodu, five years of imprisonment; Zhang Tiequn, Liu Deming, and Ni Dongsan, each sentenced to two years and six months of imprisonment.

### Lawsuit for Trademark Infringement

Nanjing's Meiling Western Drug Store has registered its Tiger-Turtle-Bear-Deer Kidney Tonic Pills with the trademark office for a long time. Recently, the Xinsheng Chemical Pharmaceutical Factory produced a type of Bear-Tiger-Deer Kidney Pills. The shape, color, packaging, and design of the medicine are similar to those produced by Meiling. The name also differs by only one character, "Turtle." An investigation revealed that Xinsheng's products are not registered. Chen argued that Xinsheng has imitated the registered trademark of others and falsely accused the products of others as counterfeits, which constitutes the crime of trademark infringement and defamation. Therefore, he hired attorney Qian Xingzhong to file a criminal lawsuit against Han Ruiyou, the owner of Xinsheng, in the First Special Court. After the interrogation was completed, Judge Lian declared the judgment yesterday: "Main Text" Han Ruiyou is sentenced to three months of imprisonment for counterfeiting a registered trademark, with a two-year suspended sentence. Other charges are not guilty.

### Robbery on Baidun Road Yesterday

### Social News

Wu Chunyuan from Jiangdu, residing at No. 59, Lane 590, Haining Road, was accused of raping his nephew's wife, Dong, and then injuring his nephew, Wu Hengmao, with a leather knife. According to the doctor's diagnosis, Wu Hengmao is beyond saving. Therefore, the police escorted Wu Chunyuan to the First Special Court yesterday morning and prosecuted him for assault. Judge Huang presided over Criminal Tribunal Three for the trial. The victim did not appear, and the court ordered a postponement for further verification.

On the sidewalk beside Pier 4 of Jardine Matheson & Co. on the Bund of the French Concession, the body of an unidentified man who had collapsed and died from illness was discovered. He was approximately thirty years old and appeared to be a worker. A police officer found a report and notified the police station, which sent detectives to investigate. Two passports issued by the British Consulate for traveling from Shanghai to Hong Kong were found on his person. They were issued on the 6th of this month. The passport had a front and side view photo of the deceased attached, and the photos also showed the name Li Xin. The body was sent to the morgue. Since there was no way to trace the relatives of the deceased, the police took photos of the body and handed it over to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Hall for burial pending claim.

At 8:00 PM the night before last, a young woman suddenly fell from the roof of No. 203, Route Cardinal Foch in the French Concession, injuring her head and losing consciousness.

### Unified Management of Kerosene Transportation and Sales

### Two Handling Measures

### Import Permits Must Be Obtained

### Transfer Requires Taxed Documents

Order from the Ministry of Finance: In order to prevent merchants from transporting kerosene from the occupied areas for private sale, the Liquid Fuel Management Committee, in consultation with this Ministry, has stipulated two handling measures as follows: (A) Kerosene transported from the occupied areas to the rear areas should be handled by oil companies in accordance with commercial sales procedures. If they paid rear area tariffs before the promulgation of the ban and can provide proof, they can be treated as re-export, released with a transfer certificate issued by the Liquid Fuel Management Committee; otherwise, it will be treated as smuggling and handled according to customs regulations. (B) For kerosene originally stored in various places and imported before the promulgation of the ban, if it is to be transferred, taxed documents should be submitted first, and the Liquid Fuel Management Committee will verify and stamp the documents before sending them to customs for inspection and release. If it is to be resold, the committee will distribute and issue sales permits.

### New Year's Day Release of New Stamps

Regarding the Jian Guo Savings Stamps for the festival, it was learned from the Shanghai Postal Bureau that the Directorate General of Posts has scheduled to issue them on New Year's Day next year and will not postpone it again. However, it is still difficult to know when Shanghai will issue them from the Directorate General, since Shanghai's environment is special. New value stamps, such as four-cent and eight-cent stamps, have been printed by a certain bookstore in Hong Kong and will be released simultaneously with the festival stamps on New Year's Day.

### China Credit Information Service Publishes Handbook of Chinese Business Stocks

Its publications, such as the Credit Information Business Directory, the English Economic Daily, and the Chinese Commercial Information Report, are popular at home and abroad and have a good reputation.

### Letter

To the Editor: Yao Aitang and Shen Jinrong claim that after reading a news item in the "Local News" column of the "Shen Bao" on the 11th of this month, which stated that prostitutes were using force to solicit customers and were injured in mutual fights, the content is clearly inconsistent with the facts. Aitang works at the Sanxin Western Music Club downstairs at No. 12, Siwen Lane, Guling Road. At around 9:00 PM on the 9th of this month, she saw someone carrying a weapon to cause trouble on the upper floors and stepped forward to dissuade them. Unexpectedly, these thugs acted like madmen, seriously injuring Aitang's nose with a sharp object. At the time, Jinrong had just finished work and returned home, residing in the front building of the house. Seeing Aitang injured, he also stepped forward to dissuade them, but the thugs beat Jinrong, causing injuries to his head and arms. The thugs Dong Yongfu and Gao Yuansheng were arrested by the Chinese constables at the scene. I am representing Aitang and Jinrong who were sent to the hospital for treatment. This is the actual situation of what happened, but what was published in the "Shen Bao" is not the truth. For this reason, I am entrusted to send a letter to the "Shen Bao" to make corrections. I hope that you will investigate and publish it in the "Letters to the Editor" column to make corrections and stop the rumors. Sincerely, Yu Hualong, Lawyer, February 13th.

### Orphanage for Refugee Children: All Teachers Suddenly Went on Strike Yesterday, Immediately Returning to Classes in the Afternoon; Teachers Dissatisfied with the Operations of the Orphanage, Demanding Rectification; the Orphanage is Scheduled to Hold a Board Meeting This Afternoon

(Dahua News Agency) All the teachers at the Shanghai Relief Orphanage for Refugee Children had a poor impression of the orphanage and were unwilling to compromise. They suddenly went on strike yesterday morning, demanding a thorough rectification. After inquiries by a Dahua News Agency reporter from various parties, the details are as follows: The cause of this strike was that the orphanage's band of refugee children usually did not attend classes and instead specialized in going to weddings and funerals to perform music. Recently, the teachers advised the band members to attend classes as usual, but they disobeyed instructions, leading to a conflict and a strike. Furthermore, the teachers stated that internal corruption had reached its peak. For example, when the orphanage band went to perform at a wedding, the hosts gave red envelopes containing tens to hundreds of dollars, but these were not recorded in the orphanage's donation registry, instead ending up in the private pockets of two or three individuals. Regarding orphanage donations, fundraisers received kickbacks of 10% to 15%. It has been found that the total donations to the orphanage amount to no less than 500,000 dollars, of which 50,000 to 60,000 dollars were deducted by these people in the name of fundraising. This is definitely true. As for whether they actually fundraised or only pretended to do so, we will not discuss it for the time being. Considering the principles of reason, for charitable organizations to collect funds and then take kickbacks, what more can be said? Mr. Yuan Ludeng, the chairman of the orphanage's board, learned of the teachers' strike and rushed to the orphanage at 11:00 AM. He gathered the teachers and all the refugee children to give a lecture and offer guidance. Classes resumed in the afternoon, and a board meeting was scheduled for 4:00 PM today (the 14th) at the Shipping Club at 93 Guangdong Road.

### Shanghai Church Universities: Called a Meeting of Presidents, Changed the Academic Calendar, Shortened the Winter Vacation, and Maintained Studies, Deciding Not to Suspend Classes

After the war, Soochow University in Suzhou and Hangzhou University in Hangzhou successively moved to Shanghai, joining Shanghai's Shanghai University and St. John's University, collectively known as the four Christian universities. They are managed by the Christian University Association of Shanghai, and classes are held at the Cishu Building on Nanjing Road, the Guangxuehui Building on Bowuyuan Road, and the St. John's University campus on Fanhuangdu. Since the U.S. State Department ordered the evacuation of overseas Chinese from the Far East, some of the clergymen from the Board of Missions of the Methodist Church, the Presbyterian Church, the Baptist Church, and the Anglican Church who held teaching positions in these four universities were preparing to evacuate. For example, Mrs. George Cox, Mrs. Wang Zonghai, Mrs. Haibos, and Mrs. Wei Allen of Shanghai University, as well as Miss Huilisheng and Mrs. Luo Tianli of Hangzhou University, have already returned to the United States on the Washington and Clipper ships. All the male professors will remain in Shanghai, and the students' studies will not be affected in any way. The school authorities are also determined to continue without interruption. More than 2,000 students are attending classes as usual. However, the school authorities, in order to carefully consider the general situation, specially convened a meeting of the presidents of the four universities a few days ago. In addition to a brief review of the recent situation of each school, in order to adapt to the current situation and facilitate teachers and students, they passed a resolution to change the academic calendar, shorten the winter vacation, and advance the start date of the next semester by one week, with classes starting on February 5. The spring break will be from April 11 to April 14, a reduction of three days compared to normal. The summer vacation will also start two weeks earlier on June 8. This will allow graduating students to graduate earlier, and give Western teachers a longer summer vacation to decide their future actions based on the evolving situation. However, in any case, in order to maintain the studies of thousands of students, the four schools have decided not to suspend classes.

### Children's Welfare Association: Yesterday's Charity Sale Was a Great Success, Raising Several Thousand Dollars in Ticket Sales

The Shanghai Children's Welfare Association held a charity sale of calligraphy, paintings, and other items at the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA yesterday, from morning to night. Buyers flocked to the event, making it a unprecedented success. On the first floor of the venue, the association displayed its own handmade leather and cloth shoes, rattan baskets, dolls, Liang Siji toothbrushes, as well as thermos bottles, soap, welfare stationery, calendars, and New Year cards. The walls were covered with calligraphy and paintings, including many fine works by Ma Gongyu, Zai Yachen, Li Qiujun, and Shi Chongpeng. Chinese and foreigners alike rushed to purchase them. The third floor displayed more than 300 Western paintings, as well as antiques and Fujian lacquerware, beautifully arranged on tables. There were also quick sketches by Mr. He Zhongda of the Youyou Orphanage, and two types of gypsum powder calligraphy (sketches at one dollar each, gypsum powder at fifteen dollars, cheaper than elsewhere, as a special offer). The images were lifelike and truly divine. Among all the exhibits, the large Hunan embroidery screen was the most distinctive, being both magnificent and exquisite, and a rare find in recent times. It is said that today, students from the Youyou Orphanage and the Children's Welfare Association will jointly perform arts and crafts for visitors, in a unique and interesting way. The reception at the venue was handled by volunteers from Huadong United Middle School, the Municipal Council Girls' High School, and other enthusiastic members of the community, ensuring orderly conduct. The Shanghai YMCA provided great assistance in organizing this charity sale, benefiting the orphans immensely. The association is very grateful. The ticket sales yesterday amounted to several thousand dollars, and today's results are sure to be even better than yesterday's.

### Hunan Education Department Orders all Private Middle Schools in the Province to be Subject to County Government Supervision

(Laiyang Dispatch) The Hunan Provincial Department of Education recently issued an order to the county governments and all private middle schools in the province, stating that the Changde County Government submitted a request on September 12 of the 29th year of the Republic, requesting that private middle schools be clearly mandated to be subject to inspection and supervision by the local county government. After investigation, the department found that private middle schools in this province have always been under the jurisdiction of the department. Now, in these extraordinary times, the age of the students and the ideology of the faculty and staff may affect military service or endanger public security. Regarding the age and ideology of the faculty and staff of each school, the local county government should be allowed to inspect and supervise. Other school administration matters will still be directly managed by the department. In addition to issuing separate instructions, this order is hereby issued for compliance.

### "Zhong Kui Catches Ghosts"

— Su Nong

The "little ghosts" are in power, causing the "family" to be uneasy. The "juniors" gathered to ask the "parents" to make a decision, and the "parents" decided to put a yellow talisman at the door: "Jiang Taigong is here, nothing is forbidden!"

Who knew that "Jiang Taigong" was useless, and the "little ghosts" only multiplied. The "juniors" simply couldn't live, so they forced the "parents" to think of an effective solution; therefore, they invited "Zhong Kui" over.

When "Zhong Kui" came: one hand held a sword, the other a knife, the "momentum" seemed very loud; but inside the steel gauntlet was often a tender hand! You see, as soon as he arrived, he compromised: "At most, forty can stay here, any more will be severely punished! And no noise!"

"The little ghosts meekly agreed..."

Over the year, the "little ghosts" increased, with a tendency to reach one or two hundred; so the "juniors" again forced the "parents," and the "parents" called "Zhong Kui" again.

This time, "Zhong Kui" had a bow in addition to the sword and knife, and shouted: "At most eighty-seven can stay here, any more will be severely punished! And..."

Alas! Is this "Zhong Kui Catches Ghosts"?

### I No Longer Cry

— Youbin

After reading the article "My Mother is a Singer" on November 30th, my heart was stirred by infinite sympathy and sorrowful memories buried deep within. Truly, under this unreasonable social system, a mother's misfortune brings pain to her children, and even the fragile souls of children can feel this pain. What a cruel thing this is!

In this feudal society, a person's background and family determined their social status. My mother also had an unfortunate past. She became a concubine of an elder in a large family, and thus was in a position of being despised and ridiculed. This old-fashioned woman, a believer in fate, had no other choice but to cry secretly to herself, or recite more Buddhist chants to pray for a better destiny in the next life. In her dark life, I, her child, became her only comfort.

But children can also bring her pain. When I was a naive child, attending elementary school, sometimes conflicts and scolding with my friends caused me a strange feeling, because they always used a special language that I didn't understand to scold me; and when they scolded, other classmates would always laugh or whisper nearby. This caused doubt to arise in my young heart, and I had to go back and ask my mother. However, before my mother could explain to me, tears of sorrow that I would never forget welled up in her eyes. From that moment on, my heart began to understand pain.

Later, even when one of my best friends used the same words to scold me during a casual quarrel, my extreme pain turned into anger, and I finally decisively broke off the friendship with him. When my mother discovered my mental abnormality and questioned me, I cried, and my mother cried too. What else could we do? But I felt a little comfort in my heart, because I had finally sacrificed my friendship for my mother.

This pain did not continue until I left my hometown to pursue my studies. I read some books, and I recognized this unreasonable social system. So I no longer resented my friends who scolded me, but resented this social system. I no longer cried, I wanted to resist, to resist all the unreasonable things in this old society.

This article "My Mother is a Singer" evoked my memories, because what the author felt was exactly what I had felt before. But I no longer feel sad and painful about this, and I also hope that this author and all the young people who are in pain because of their mothers will no longer be in pain.

What does it matter if my mother is a singer? Singers do it to make a living! If this society could enable singers to do other work to support their lives instead of being singers, would this mother still have the heart to cause her children so much pain? Moreover, a singer is, after all, a profession, although perhaps despised by the so-called gentlemen, but if you think about it carefully, isn't she at least better than the pampered, spoiled noble ladies who do nothing all day long but enjoy themselves? A singer at least uses her own strength to earn a living for herself and her children; but these noble ladies are parasites of society, completely useless.

In fact, even if the mother's profession is so-called lower than a singer, what does it matter to her children? Is this the children's sin? Why isn't a prostitute's child necessarily more lovable, smarter, and more outstanding than a child from a wealthy family?

However, the evil forces of the old society are too terrible, and the fragile souls of young people may not be able to withstand its attacks, but because of this, we should be brave and understand the irrationality of this social system, and then unite to relieve our own pain.

The world is not all dark. If you can't find sympathy in one aspect, you can find it in another. This world is full of enthusiastic, righteous, and compassionate young people, so we should no longer be in pain because our mothers are singers. We must bravely live on!

(3) Thugs Surprise the Beauty

The next day, Zhang Tianru visited Liu Rushi's boudoir at dusk, carrying a bundle of brocade paper for Liu Rushi to see, and said: "The day before yesterday, we enjoyed ourselves at the Rainbow-Spanning Pavilion, chatting over wine, which brought me the joy of both the scenery and the beauty. We also met that strange iron beggar, like Shi Lu meeting Qiu Ran Gong riding a lame donkey from all directions, I couldn't help but hum." Yesterday, at my humble home, I wielded my brush and composed dozens of rhymes, and today I specially brought them for you. I hear that you are also good at poetry, so you can follow my rhymes." Liu Rushi unfolded the brocade paper and recited it softly. Zhang Tianru sat on the chair beside her, stroking his short mustache, looking pleased. Zhang Tianru's poem had a total of sixty rhymes. After Liu Rushi finished reciting them one by one, she passed them to Jiangzi to read. She herself took a sip of tea and said, "Everything the teacher has written is excellent, and even You Xia would not dare to criticize it." Zhang Tianru laughed heartily and said, "You flatter me too much. Do you have any, Rushi?" Liu Rushi then went to the drawer of her desk and took out a piece of Sichuan paper, and presented it to Zhang Tianru with both hands, saying: "Please, teacher, accept it." Just as Zhang Tianru took it, Xu Shiniang walked into the room from outside and handed a piece of white paper to Rushi. Liu Rushi looked at it and said; "Oh, it turns out he is inviting guests, it's rare for him to want me to attend the banquet, so it's necessary to go." Zhang Tianru, being afraid that someone would steal Liu Rushi from him, hurriedly put down the Sichuan paper and asked, "Who is it?" Liu Rushi replied, "It's that Chen Wuzi, the teacher also knows him." Zhang Tianru couldn't help scratching his head when he heard the three words "Chen Wuzi" and said, "It turns out it's Chen Wuzi. He is talented and unconventional, a famous figure here. You probably want to go." Liu Rushi nodded slightly and said, "I want to go, please sit here for a while, teacher, and let Jiangzi recite Song lyrics. I can't accompany you." Zhang Tianru smiled somewhat involuntarily and said, "I know you want to go, so you go ahead. I will teach Jiangzi to read poetry here, and after a while, I will visit a friend." Liu Rushi also smiled, then went to the back room to change her clothes. After a while, she gracefully walked to the outside, with bright pendants and emerald feathers, in gorgeous attire, more radiant than usual, truly like an immortal descending to earth. Liu Rushi stood in front of a dressing mirror, admiring herself. Zhang Tianru squinted his nearsighted eyes and watched from the side, murmuring in a low voice, humming something that was not clear. Liu Rushi was eager to go out and did not pay attention to him. She turned her head and said something, then went downstairs and left in a sedan chair. As she stepped out of the door, Zhang Tianru looked at Liu Rushi's graceful figure from behind, and couldn't help but sigh softly, with a hint of displeasure on his face. Jiangzi had already taken a copy of Liu Yong's lyrics and walked to the desk. Zhang Tianru had to teach Jiangzi to read the lyrics, explaining some tones. Seeing that Rushi had not returned, and the messengers with invitations came one after another. Xu Danniang knew that Liu Rushi would not return early from Chen Wuzi's place, so she instructed Jiangzi to entertain some guests, and Jiangzi also left in elaborate attire. Zhang Tianru sat alone in the boudoir, bored. First, he revised Liu Rushi's poem, then took a piece of white paper and filled out a poem, pressing it together with the jade lion pendant on the table, leaving it for Liu Rushi to read when she returned. The poem implicitly expressed his love for Liu Rushi, testing her heart, because he knew that Liu Rushi was quite interested in Chen Wuzi, and feared that he himself was older and his family was ordinary. Although he was Liu Rushi's teacher, he could often see her beautiful face, but he suspected that the beauty's heart was not necessarily attached to him, so he left this poem to express his feelings and see how Liu Rushi would answer after reading it when she returned. Who knew that Liu Rushi would experience a scare when she returned in the evening? (9)

### Shirley Temple's Friend, Sybil Jason, Passed Through Shanghai; Qi Fan Benefited, Rong Returned to His Old Home in Africa via Shanghai; Her Term Expired and She Returned to the United States to Continue Her Efforts in the Film Industry

A Hollywood star quietly came to Shanghai for sightseeing the day before yesterday, stayed for only one day, and left yesterday. She is Sybil Jason, only thirteen years old, but with a long history in film. She belongs to 20th Century Fox and has co-starred with her friend Shirley Temple in films such as "The Blue Bird," gaining fame in the silver screen, with a reputation second only to Shirley Temple.

Sybil is in the United States, but always thinks about her home in Cape Town, South Africa. It turns out she hasn't been back for seven years, no wonder she misses home so much. So she finally asked the company for leave and returned home with her sister, Anneta. They set off on the President Jackson, and when the ship arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday, the sisters excitedly disembarked and toured everywhere, buying whatever they liked, filling both arms before returning to the ship.

The reporter met her sisters on the President Jackson. Anneta is still young, with a friendly smile, while Sybil maintains a naive and lively demeanor. "Oh, great!" is her catchphrase. She likes this international city of Shanghai very much, but when she saw beggars dying on the street, she seemed lost and remained depressed for a long time. The reporter asked Sybil what she thought about the current spread of war in the world, with flames of war everywhere? She excused herself as being too young to discuss world affairs and could only talk about her own problems. She said that after her home vacation expires, she will return to Hollywood to continue her efforts in the film industry, because she has the ambition to make film her lifelong career.

The President Jackson left port yesterday, with the Sybil sisters traveling on the same ship. We wish her a smooth journey.

### Sun Jinglu's New Attempt

— Xia

Playing Two Roles in "Sunrise"

Sun Jinglu's talent has been appreciated by the audience, and recently she is the most noticed new star. We are happy to discover this new talent, and from now on, there will be one more talented person in the art world; on the other hand, we also have great expectations for her, that is, we cherish her future, and hope that she will not be proud or vain, and love cultivation and live seriously, just like her current love of travel.

It is more accurate to say that Sun Jinglu is a new stage star than a new movie star, because after filming "The Family of Qin Huai" at the Golden Star Film Company, she has been busy starring in "Woman" at the Xuantian Theater day and night, with little time to rest, and naturally less time to go to the set. In her own opinion, both film and stage plays are her favorite art forms, and going to the set and going on stage are no different.

After "Woman," the China Travel Troupe's "The Wilderness" gave her a short rest; and then came the starring role in "Sunrise." In order to give her new gains, the China Travel Troupe decided to have her play two roles in the play, namely Cui Xi and Chen Bailu in "Sunrise." The personalities of these two roles are completely different, and the performance style and posture are in no way similar. Sun Jinglu said that she accepted the challenge and that it might as well be a new attempt.

### "Great Shanghai" Contract Not Expired

— Yindi

Renaming to Yu Qiaqing Theater Cannot Be Confirmed; Location for "Xi Shi" Premiere Also Cannot Be Determined

There has been much speculation about the renaming of the Great Shanghai Theater to Yu Qiaqing Great Theater. However, inquiries from related parties have revealed that this statement cannot be confirmed for the time being; perhaps the time has not yet come, so no decision has been made.

Another point is enough to confirm the error of external rumors, that is, the early recovery of the Great Shanghai Theater is almost impossible in fact; because the Asia Company has indicated that it is unwilling to give up its jurisdiction over the Great Shanghai before the expiration of the contract. (Note: The contract will expire in June next year.) Therefore, the premiere period of the film "Xi Shi" is still waiting for the Asia Company's allocation in the New Year.

"Xi Shi" is another costume epic directed by Bu Wancang after "Diao Chan." It began filming long before Jin Yan left Shanghai. The cast is Yuan Meiyun as Xi Shi, Li Hong as Zheng Dan, Wang Yuanlong as Wu Zixu, Wang Xianzhai as Fucha, Li Ming as Goujian, Xia Xia as the Yue Queen, Tang Jie as Bo Pi. The role of Fan Li was originally intended to be played by Jin Yan, but after Jin Yan left Shanghai, it was changed to Mei Xi. In terms of lineup, it can be seen that the Xinhua authorities attach great importance to the filming of the film. Now, although the Asia Company has obtained the initial screening rights for this film, the location of the premiere is still to be determined, whether it will be at the Great Light or the Great Shanghai. The date of the premiere is naturally even more difficult to predict.

"Chinese Snow White" Interlude Recorded

I heard that this "Chinese Snow White" is planned to be transported to Hollywood for release, what a joyful news this should be.

Chen Juanjuan in "Chinese Snow White"

Oriental Shirley Temple, a rare child star in the Chinese film industry, Chen Juanjuan, her film "Chinese Snow White," which she independently starred in after returning to Shanghai, everyone has seen it. The criticism from public opinion is that Chen Juanjuan's acting skills, compared to later works, why, the United Nations has not yet issued a statement, perhaps it will wait for Chen Juanjuan to rest for a period of time before saying. A few days ago, I learned that Chen Juanjuan plans to make up for her English during this break. She has now invited a Western English professor (who is also a doctor and usually admires Chen Juanjuan's art very much, so she agreed to teach him). He is teaching Chen Juanjuan English on a voluntary basis.

Now, it is stipulated that she will study for one hour a day, from 4:00 to 5:00 PM, or from 5:00 to 6:00 PM. She goes to study with her mother-in-law every day.

In addition, the opening song in "Chinese Snow White" has been selected by Pathé Records to be recorded into a record. Pathé Records has decided to invite Chen Juanjuan to sing on the 16th, with Han Langen, Gu Xiucen, Tang Jie, Hong Jingling and other seven dwarfs providing backup vocals. In addition, Pathé has also specially invited composer Li Jinguang to compose a song called "Wind and Rain" and invited Chen Juanjuan to record it.
