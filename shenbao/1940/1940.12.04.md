### U.S. Congress Unanimously Approves $100 Million Loan to China; U.S. to Supply China with Military Aircraft and Implement New Steps in Embargo Against Japan

Washington - The Senate Banking Committee and the House Coinage Committee unanimously passed a measure for the United States to loan $100 million to China. Half of this amount will be allocated from the Exchange Stabilization Fund, and the remaining half will be disbursed by the Export-Import Bank. According to President Roosevelt's statement on the matter at the end of this week, $50 million of this loan will be used for currency protection and management of the exchange rate between Chinese and American currencies, while the remaining $50 million will be for general purposes. After the loan was passed by the committees of both houses, Treasury Secretary Morgenthau explained the details of the proposed agreement to the two committees, saying that his purpose in attending Congress had been achieved, that is, he had received a vote of confidence. "We will now immediately conclude this transaction with China," he said. Secretary of State Hull stated the general policy of the United States in assisting the Chinese government under the leadership of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, saying that he believed the loan agreement to China was extremely important and, under the current circumstances, the least we could do.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Declares Loan Safeguards Peace

Washington - The Joint Committee of the Senate and House of Representatives yesterday unanimously passed a proposal of confidence in the executive branch's economic assistance to China. Secretary of State Hull suddenly attended a secret meeting of the Senate Banking and Currency Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee to listen in. President Roosevelt, in announcing the $50,000,000 loan to China on Saturday, had said Treasury Secretary Morgenthau would publicly propose to the joint committee to grant a credit of $50 million to China to help stabilize the Chinese legal tender. It is understood that Morgenthau told the committee that if the status quo in the Far East is to be maintained, assistance to China is most needed. If China can obtain sufficient economic assistance, it can establish a solid defense. If so, it can indirectly prevent Japan from further openly disregarding American interests in the Pacific or creating another chaotic incident. The Treasury Secretary solemnly declared that the loan was intended to safeguard peace and was only a consistent policy of the United States. It is said that Hull expressed great approval of Morgenthau's remarks. It is also reported that Morgenthau pointed out that even if the United States fully supports China's currency, it will not harm its own stabilization fund. Morgenthau also said that this was an excellent economic stance. Secretary of State Hull said, "This is the minimum amount of assistance we can give to China." Morgenthau told reporters after the meeting that he had not made any definite decisions because he believed in Congress. He also pointed out that last year he told the Senate committee that he hoped to receive "guidance" before using the stabilization fund to help foreign countries in the war. Morgenthau said, "I can now proceed directly with the work because I have completed the procedures. I will return to the Treasury Department to complete the mission as soon as possible." Hull expressed satisfaction with the committee's actions during his sudden attendance. Republican Senator Townsend of Delaware was one of the numerous senators who participated in the meeting. He predicted that the executive branch would not encounter serious opposition from the Republican side in implementing this plan. Townsend also said that, in fact, there would be no need to use new legislation to speed up aid to China. Morgenthau also said that the government has not yet decided on all the detailed plans for stabilizing Chinese currency, but it is undoubtedly the case that this plan will include the United States purchasing Chinese yuan at a certain price. The fixed price of the Chinese yuan is currently being negotiated in Washington by Song Ziwen, the former Chinese Minister of Finance. Morgenthau also announced that, to date, of the $99,000,000 in American loans that China has borrowed since 1931, $81,500,000 has been repaid. Morgenthau also said that, out of respect for the opinions of Song Ziwen and the Chinese government, the United States cannot formally publish the content of this matter until negotiations are established in Washington and Song Ziwen agrees to publish it. Morgenthau solemnly declared that the stabilization fund will only be used for "stabilization work" and will not be issued in the form of loans. Morgenthau said, "We only buy Chinese yuan with US dollars." Morgenthau said that Chinese currency had fallen sharply before, but recently it has been quite stable. He also said that the result of the devaluation of Chinese currency would greatly increase the living standards of the Chinese people. In order to improve the internal situation in China, we are thinking of balancing China's legal tender. (United Press, 3rd)

China to Order Light Bombers from the U.S. Soon

Washington - Chinese diplomatic circles here said today that President Roosevelt's agreement to loan $100 million to China has enabled China to first purchase 50 light bombers from the United States for the purpose of protecting the Burma Road and defending against Japanese air raids. U.S. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau revealed last night that the Senate Banking Committee and the House Currency Committee had given Morgenthau and Secretary of State Hull a unanimous vote of confidence regarding the allocation of half of the promised loan from the $200 million Exchange Stabilization Fund. The detailed procedures for the aircraft purchase advance payment have not been explained. It is speculated that the U.S. Treasury Department will purchase 50 million Chinese yuan, enabling the Chinese National Government to obtain the equivalent value in U.S. dollars to pay the aircraft manufacturers. The U.S. Exchange Stabilization Fund has never been used for other purposes other than stabilizing currency prices. When the European war first broke out, Morgenthau requested the committee in charge to give guidance before using the Treasury fund, so this time Morgenthau said, "The Senate and House committees have given me a unanimous vote of confidence, and I will act as quickly as possible on the advice of the lawyers."

Two Squadrons of U.S. Fighter Planes May Be Sold to China

Washington - The rapid strengthening of the U.S. Far East policy last night seemed to have gone beyond economic aid to China and was leaning towards supplying General Chiang Kai-shek's fighting forces with important military aircraft and other military supplies. This move followed yesterday's unanimous passage by the Joint Committee of the Senate and House of Representatives to loan China $100 million in U.S. dollars. After the committee passed the matter, Secretary of State Hull stated that the U.S. Far East policy would be based on raw materials and economic aid to China to the extent possible, because the Chongqing government is currently fighting against aggressive forces. The result of China's prolonged war against Japan is sufficient to prevent Japan from building the so-called "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere." Official American sources declared last night that there is now a "good opportunity" for a portion of the U.S. Army's aircraft to be given to the Chongqing government. It is said that these aircraft are not needed by the U.S. first-line aircraft, but they are more than sufficient to fight against Japan's best aircraft. It is generally known that U.S. officials have been discussing the issue of assisting China with raw materials, which was recently discussed in Washington with the Chinese Air Force delegation. The Secretary of State remained silent yesterday on questions raised about whether the United States would make another loan to China to be used to purchase American fighter planes. Unconfirmed rumors were circulating here last night that two squadrons of U.S. Army fighter planes recently sent to the Philippines for reinforcement may be sold to China. It is said that the procedure for selling them to China will be that the Army will first return the planes to the manufacturers, who will then sell them to the Chinese government. Observers recalled that Secretary of War Stimson told reporters when he approved the planes' orders to the Philippines that the planes were "the latest type of fighter planes" and not "training planes." At the same time, in economic terms, government officials also indicated that new embargo steps against Japan would soon be implemented. Colonel Maxwell, chairman of the Army-Navy Munitions Board, issued a statement last night advocating tightening restrictions on the export of aviation gasoline. His statement is in line with the views of other parts of the executive branch that major military raw materials will be stopped from being shipped to Japan in order to weaken Japan's military apparatus. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau said yesterday in supporting the loan to China from the Senate and House that the biggest of the questions the committee considered yesterday was whether to determine if China was at war or at peace. He said that the committee finally believed that since the U.S. government had not implemented neutrality laws on the Sino-Japanese war, China was, in a technical sense, at peace. He added, "This is a part of the Chinese situation. China has made the executive branch recognize that China now needs assistance." (United Press, 3rd)

U.S. Newspapers Unanimously Endorse Large Loan to China

Washington - Editorials in national newspapers today unanimously condemned the Japanese-Wang Nanjing treaty and endorsed the new U.S. loan to China. This clearly shows the U.S. position on the situation arising from Japan's recognition of the Nanjing regime. Some newspapers even said that, in addition to the loan, the United States intends to assist China with American raw materials, such as aircraft, to protect the Burma Road. The Washington Post said that this farce, which Japan had to perform, was merely to save face and that the U.S. loan to China was appropriate because Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek refused to participate in Japan's new order. The New York Times said that the loan was a condemnation of the Nanjing treaty and that the Japanese knew it, too. The American people wholeheartedly support America's posture, which lets the small Eastern country cooperating with Hitler know that America will not stand idly by. There is a widespread feeling in America that any possible aid to China should be part of America's own defense program. China's valiant resistance deserves praise. It is thanks to the strength of the Chinese army that the United States has been able to accumulate Eastern raw materials in time and focus all its efforts on helping Britain and strengthening its own defenses. The New York Times praised China as an honest debtor, saying that public opinion supports granting a new loan to China so that China can restrain Japan and prevent it from engaging in new acts of aggression. Seymour, the foreign news editor of the Scripps-Howard newspaper system, pointed out that the Nanjing Treaty was a failure, not a victory, for Japan, and the Washington Star also published an editorial entitled "The Nanjing Farce." (Reuters, 3rd)

Japanese Newspapers Criticize U.S. Far East Policy

Tokyo - The "Kokumin Shimbun" today joined other newspapers in vigorously criticizing the U.S. Far East policy. The newspaper said that the Sino-Japanese war now involves not only China and Japan, but the United States has also been drawn into the vortex. The "Kokumin Shimbun" declared, "We should note that the conflict between China and Japan is no longer a dispute between China and Japan, but has evolved into part of the war between the old and new orders. The United States, in the name of peaceful democracy and aid to Britain, is maintaining order and preventing the rise of Japan, Germany, and Italy. In other words, the United States is thinking of undermining peace in the Far East, plunging it into chaos for a long time, so that Japan is exhausted and unable to cope with future important developments." The "Kokumin Shimbun" also said that the appointment of Admiral Nomura as ambassador to Washington would not improve relations between the United States and Japan. "We should know that relations between the two countries are extremely tense and cannot be viewed with optimism." The "Miyako Shimbun," referring to the reported Anglo-American joint agreement in the Southeast Pacific, said, "The current situation is either devour others or be devoured by others." The newspaper warned, "In the Tripartite Pact of Germany, Italy, and Japan, Japan is betting everything. We will never allow Britain and the United States to interfere in the Greater East Asia area, because that is Japan's living space. The establishment of a new order in East Asia requires the elimination of all anti-Japanese elements and the determination to strike down third countries that support Chongqing. It is time for Japan to declare its belligerent rights to the belligerent countries, because only then can Asia for Asians be completed quickly. Only by making such a strong resolution can Japan realize the new order in East Asia. "The announcement of the new U.S. loan to China was the subject of most Tokyo newspapers, which unanimously declared that President Roosevelt announced the new loan on the day that Japan formally recognized the "Nanjing government," which is particularly noteworthy. The "Yomiuri Shimbun" said that the U.S. loan, coupled with British Foreign Secretary Halifax's announcement that he would grant Chongqing a new loan, shows that the United States and Britain are stepping up economic pressure on Japan. Japan should now rise up to block all supply lines to Chongqing and take appropriate measures to undermine the consolidation of the Chinese legal tender and take some steps to destroy all attempts to prevent the construction of a new order in East Asia.

### Burma Railway Achieves Profit

Rangoon - The Burma Railway has achieved a profit after nine years of losses. This is due to Chinese imports and exports passing through the Yunnan-Burma Highway. The railway report shows that the net income for the year ending March 1940 was 250,000 rupees. Since the Chinese government moved its import and export trade to Burma at the end of last year, railway transport has increased, so that the railway's total revenue is no less than 1.3 million rupees, compared to only 600,000 rupees in the previous year. Without Chinese trade, this year would not only not have a surplus, but would also have a deficit. (Reuters, 2nd)

Editorial

### The Next Blitzkrieg by Germany and Italy

The people of the British Isles have long regarded the English Channel as a natural barrier, and the winter snow, rain, and fog as a natural cover. Moreover, their morale is high, and they are in high spirits. The so-called superior conditions of timing, geography, and human harmony are now all in place. The armchair strategists have long said that if Hitler does not achieve a decisive victory in his war against England before this winter, then even if he has plans for a clever invasion of England, he must wait until the weather warms up next spring before implementing them. These kinds of arguments certainly have their merits. However, at a time when survival is at stake and there is a sense of walking on thin ice, how can those who bear the heavy responsibility of a nation dare to rely on such observations and become complacent? However, there are also some people, even members of Parliament, who therefore want to solicit the consent of the belligerent countries to have a temporary truce around Christmas, so that the combat personnel can spend this holiday in "peace." Although this proposal has been dismissed by the British government, the general psychological tension in Britain seems to have disappeared with the autumn wind, which cannot be concealed. In addition, the Nazi war machine, since crushing the resistance of France, has not performed for a long time, except for the Air Force. This is enough to make the public gradually dissipate their long-standing impression of its attacking and destructive power, and gradually give rise to a relaxed illusion. Not only that, but the Italian military's setback in Greece, and the situation in the Balkans being constrained by Bulgaria's strength, are also enough to make the public think that Germany and Italy's plans for an offensive in the Near East have failed and that they are now at a loss. These views have their basis. However, I ask, is Britain safe in winter? Has the Nazi war machine reached the end of its rope? Has the situation in the Balkans made Germany and Italy retreat? Not only does no one dare to affirm this boldly, but these situations should be regarded as containing the best conditions for the Nazis to implement their "blitzkrieg tactics." Leaving aside all other conditions, it should be known that seizing the opportunity when the enemy is complacent and inattentive, and launching a lightning-like action to catch the enemy off guard and force them to surrender, is precisely the essence of the so-called blitzkrieg tactics! The past is vivid, with blood and tears, and the lessons are not far away, so we should be vigilant!

From the perspective of Germany and Italy: The key to Germany's decisive victory is to have a quick and decisive battle. Hitler has indeed defeated France, which is known for its army, in one fell swoop. This is the effect of a quick and decisive battle. Fortunately, it was decisive, otherwise, if it had been in a stalemate for three or two years or more, and the forces of the British and French overseas colonies had converged, it would be a great question whether Germany could have won. This principle is now being used to deal with Britain, although it has been greatly discounted, but waiting a year or six months later will definitely be even worse than now. Even now, Britain's naval blockade is becoming tighter and tighter. Since the Italian-Greek war began, the battle of Taranto has suddenly wiped out half of the Italian Navy, and the British Navy's seizure of the Greek ports has further strengthened Britain's control over the Mediterranean. From this alone, one can imagine how serious the British naval blockade is. Therefore, the urgent task now facing Germany and Italy is, regardless of which direction, to break out a path as soon as possible. They must not sit and wait for the only resources to be depleted by massive consumption, and ultimately suffer an irreparable defeat. From this, it can be seen that Germany has always had a reason and a necessity to adopt blitzkrieg tactics.

One of the biggest reasons why Germany has not launched large-scale external invasions in the past few months is that it has been engaged in reorganizing and developing the conquered countries. So far, this work has probably achieved considerable success. Autumn has passed, and the agricultural products, livestock, and poultry of various countries are precisely the season for collecting and accumulating, which form Germany's war food. All factories, given time, will also become part of the Nazi production machine. After this considerable period of military occupation, the appeasement policy towards the conquered, as well as the work of suppression and purging, must have reduced their worries about the rear. All of this has of course created the instinct and dependence of the Nazis to continue to invade and expand outwards. Apart from these, the thorny issue of Italy's war against Greece is certainly an urgent task that Germany and Italy must resolve. Not only has Germany and Italy's desire for the Balkans been reversed, but also, with Britain providing substantial assistance to Greece and the vague support of Turkey, Germany and Italy's prestige in the Balkans and beyond has begun to waver, and the so-called "New Order" has suddenly suffered a miserable and brutal blow. If Germany and Italy want to overcome this difficulty, they must try to defeat Greece with all their strength, and then invade the Balkans. It is even better to strike and conquer England with a blitzkrieg strategy.

In summary, let us analyze the possible directions of Germany and Italy's future "blitzkrieg." There are probably no more than three paths: The first is to suddenly attack the British Isles. Recently, the British "News Chronicle" solemnly pointed out that Germany's systematic bombing of major industrial centers in Britain is noteworthy and that it may be a prelude to Hitler's attempt to land in Britain. The difficulty of this move lies in the inability to break the power of the British fleet in the English Channel, so landing is difficult, and the subsequent strength and resupply after landing are even more difficult. The second is to suddenly advance into the Balkans. This move may inevitably risk another great injustice and require the occupation of Yugoslavia or Bulgaria in one fell swoop from the land, and then attack Greece and encompass the Balkans. The third is to seize the Strait of Gibraltar from Spain and suddenly break into Africa. The main problem with this move is Spain's attitude: will Germany and Italy use Spain as a pretense and directly do it themselves, or will they act behind Spain with Germany and Italy as their backing? Among the three paths, the gains and losses are really difficult to express in a word, but it cannot be denied that each has the possibility of being adopted!

### Spokesperson for the Military Council Discusses the Week's War Situation, November 24th to 30th

Chongqing: The spokesperson for the Military Council discusses the week's war situation (from November 24th to 30th).

Hubei Province: Before November 24th, the Japanese troops stationed in small strongholds in Tongcheng, Jiuling, and Xiantao in southern Hubei Province frequently caused disturbances, but were repeatedly defeated. In addition, the plague was prevalent near Tongcheng, leading to a high mortality rate, and they were no longer capable of action. From the 24th, the Japanese troops entrenched on both sides of the Xiang River in Dangyang, Jingmen, Zhongxiang, and Suixian suddenly launched simultaneous attacks, using dozens of aircraft and dozens of tanks for cover. They were severely attacked by the Chinese army and forced to retreat. Another unit advanced to Miaoqian and Yangjiaji but was intercepted by the Chinese army. The remaining troops attacked near Lexiangguan from Jingmen but were ambushed from the northwest and suffered heavy losses. To the east of the Xiang River, Chinese troops lured them to Changshoudian and Zaijiadian, using the terrain and fierce firepower to encircle and disperse them from high ground. On the 27th, the Japanese troops who attacked from Suixian were driven into the Tangjiachong and Gujiawan areas. The Chinese army has now recovered Jingmingpu, Kuaihuoling, Lishan, Jinjiling, and other places on the front lines of the Xianghua Road.

Southern Anhui: In Anhui Province, Chinese troops annihilated more than half of the thousand-plus Japanese troops in Guoyang on the 21st. The Japanese fled, and Guoyang was recovered. On the same day, more than two thousand Japanese infantry and cavalry troops from Dongliu and Yan in southern Anhui attacked Zhide. After fierce fighting, the Chinese troops captured Libukou, Luojiating, and other strongholds southwest of Zhide on the 24th and 25th. By the 26th, the suburbs of Zhide were all in Chinese hands, and the city was tightly besieged. At noon on the 27th, the Japanese troops could not hold out and abandoned supplies and artillery, fleeing eastward in disarray. However, one unit was surrounded by the Chinese army northeast of Zhide. Zhide was completely recovered.

Shanxi and Henan: In Shanxi Province, the Japanese troops who attacked from Changzi were severely attacked by the Chinese army. Those who attacked Sisizhen were routed. Chinese troops in Jincheng are now approaching the suburbs. The Japanese troops in Hongdong on the Tongpu Railway are currently under attack from the east, west, and north. The Chinese army has also recovered strongholds such as Guduishan and Huashiya south of the Tongpu Railway. Chinese troops bypassed Zhangmao Avenue and attacked Bazhengcun, Dakuancun, and other strongholds such as Kennanzhuang and Shengru Tan, disrupting traffic between Qu and Qinxian. The Japanese troops in Zhongyang, Quwo, and Jiexian were all attacked by the Chinese army. Along the Pinghan Road and Daoqing in northern Henan, the Japanese troops have been subdued after days of mopping-up operations by the Chinese army. The Japanese troops in Luoshan in southern Henan have repeatedly attempted to attack but were all repelled.

Jiangxi and Guangdong: Chinese troops repeatedly attacked Japanese strongholds southeast of Nanchang. The only remaining Japanese strongholds outside Ruichang, Lei Wang Zhuang and Zhang Bao, were attacked by the Chinese army, killing 540 Japanese soldiers and capturing 52, of whom 23 later died of their injuries.

### Continued Clashes on the Thai-Vietnamese Border; One French Warship Said to Have Been Seized by Thai Forces; New Progress Seen in Negotiations Between the Two Sides

Bangkok: There continue to be minor clashes along the Thai-Vietnamese border, and there have also been encounters between the air forces of both sides. Local officials claim that a Thai plane flying over the Nakhon Phanom area of Thailand encountered French forces along the Vietnamese border and was fired upon with machine guns. Later, two French planes intruded into Thai territory, and three Thai planes engaged them. After five minutes, the French planes fled. One of them crashed and exploded due to an emergency landing.

Hanoi: The Thai capital's radio station has issued a message saying that Vietnamese people who attempted to cross the border to escape to Thailand were shot at by French troops. Local officials have now issued a public statement denying this, saying that many French priests and nuns living in Thailand have not only been subjected to abuse, but have also been expelled from the country. For example, Bishop Maraful and three nuns from Suer were expelled and arrived in Gai Ke City from Thailand on November 29th. They said that they were locked in iron cages by the Thai authorities for ten hours, and then expelled from the country, without being allowed to take any possessions. The next day, they met Father Escofon and Sister Ivona in Savannakhet City, and learned that they had also been forced to leave Ubon City in Thailand. Father Escofon was publicly humiliated by the Thai people. (2nd day Havas telegram)

Bangkok: Thai officials issued an appeal yesterday, urging the people to trust the government, remain calm, and continue with their livelihoods. At the same time, officials said that there have been daily encounters between Thai and Vietnamese troops. According to an official report released here yesterday, Vietnamese troops attempted to land in Trat. A French warship, or perhaps a gunboat, participated in the battle. Thailand sent two planes to bomb it. The French warship suffered heavy damage, and the Vietnamese troops were forced to retreat. The Ministry of Interior yesterday ordered local authorities in all provinces to report on developments in the situation to the public at any time, and to urge the people of each province to trust the government and remain calm.

Hanoi: Today, hostile actions have begun in the areas of Laos and Cambodia along the Thai-Vietnamese border. This situation is a reaction to what the government calls retaliation carried out yesterday. However, the details of the so-called retaliation are still unknown due to the activities of the local fifth column. It is said that the local fifth column is responsible for cutting off telephone and telegraph lines between the Lao border and the war zone. Transportation between cities in the Mekong River basin and Hanoi is completely threatened. Although Hanoi officials remain calm, they have begun to express that the situation will worsen. However, officials also said that the Vietnamese people would rather be shattered jade than cede an inch of land to Thailand. The unrest in Cochinchina has gradually subsided. French planes are still bombing the railway junction of Mato (transliteration). Officials also said that after a French river boat patrolling the Mekong River was fired upon with machine guns by Thai forces, one French crew member was killed and several were injured.

### Greek Troops Fight Bravely Through Snow; Major Victory Gained in the South; Right Wing Advances Towards the City of Elbasan; The Italian Alpine Division Annihilated

London: Italian troops are currently retreating from Pogradec towards Elbasan, with Greek troops pursuing closely behind. However, the most significant victory for the Greek troops was in the south. Today, Italian troops have been driven to the highlands in front of Telvino. Telvino is a town located on the highway between Argirocastro and Santi Quaranta, which are important supply bases. Currently, this road is under Greek artillery fire. It seems that the Italian troops intend to continue shifting their supply lines northward. (3rd day Reuters telegram)

Sofia: Wireless broadcasts from Athens received here state that Greek troops, fighting through snow, repelled a full-scale counterattack by Italian troops yesterday and are continuing to advance. It is said that in the northern area around Elbasan, the Italian counterattacking forces suffered huge losses and retreated. Greek troops are also bombarding the retreating Italian troops with continuous and intense artillery fire. The broadcast also stated that the Greek occupation of Pogradec "has given the victorious Greek troops a new horizontal line, as that place is the strongest Italian position in Albania." (3rd day United Press telegram)

Southern Monastir: The Italian troops facing the Greek right-wing front in northern Albania are now retreating from the source of the Skumbi River towards the important town of Elbasan, which is eighteen miles from the Albanian capital. Due to heavy snow and thick clouds, British and Greek air forces have not been able to fully bomb and disrupt the retreating Italian troops. However, the Greek troops are advancing north from a village west of Moscopole, having crossed the Linyka Mountains and making a fan-shaped advance towards the Kamia Mountains. The Greek front line now stretches from the western slope of the Kamia Mountains, north to Mount Inclaire and Maglişt, north of Pogradec. Italian troops in the highlands near there have shelled Pogradec. Large numbers of Greek troops on the Mokra Mountains are making a fan-shaped advance towards Lake Ohrid. On Sunday, artillery units from both sides exchanged fire, but general warfare was greatly hampered by snowfall, as snow was five to six feet deep in some places. According to messages from Corfu, Italian planes bombed the city and surrounding areas on Sunday, damaging some residences and shops. A church was hit and collapsed, and several people were killed or injured. The city has no military targets. According to recent news, the Greek left wing has now placed the supply line from Argirocastro to the port of Santi Quaranta within range of their artillery fire. British bombers are also attacking that line. (3rd day Reuters telegram)

Budapest: Here it was listened to a Greek broadcast, pursuing the retreating Italian troops, the Greek forces have crossed Pogradec by thirty kilometers, also saying that the Italian Alpine division can be regarded as completely annihilated, and the Italian military formation on the northern front has no hope. The number of Italian prisoners reached several thousand. It is said that the Greek army is now in a stable position and is continuing to advance in the Telvino area. The Italian troops retreating in Santi Quaranta abandoned artillery, machine guns and other military supplies. (3rd day United Press telegram)

Athens: Greek authoritative sources learned this morning that the Italian front line in Albania completely collapsed last night, and the Italian troops in general retreat were violently pursued by Greek troops. According to official announcements, the Greek army has occupied many important mountain positions and captured thousands of Italian soldiers. According to a report from a war correspondent on the front line, the Greek offensive in the past few days has given the Greek army a dominant position in southern Albania. Italian troops retreating from Pogradec were destroyed by artillery fire from Greek artillery, and most of them were destroyed by artillery fire. It is said that 5,000 Italian troops were captured in the northern region yesterday alone. Unconfirmed news said that another 3,000 Italian troops were captured in the central part of the front line, and it was rumored that the Italian troops there had been cut into several sections. Greek troops in the south have the potential to occupy Telvino. If that city falls, the Greek army will further occupy Putida. It is said that the Greek army has consolidated new positions near Plamiti. It is reported that the Italian troops in the north are now collapsing towards Tirana. (3rd day International News Agency telegram)

Athens: A United Press correspondent with the Greek army on the Epirus front recently reported that the Greek army has now occupied an important fortified village on the Albanian coast. Italian troops may be forced to carry out a general retreat on this coastal front. This large village, which constitutes the base of operations in the coastal area, was occupied by the Greek army this morning after three days of artillery fire and aerial bombardment. The reporter continued that because shells were constantly falling on the village and planes were dropping countless tons of bombs on Italian field artillery and troop concentrations, the Italian troops had to abandon this important stronghold. The village is the main point of the Italian defense of the coast. The fall of the village may lead to a complete withdrawal of Italian troops from this area. The reporter also said, "I have heard that the Italian troops are withdrawing their heavy artillery, and I fear that a general retreat has already begun." Since the beginning of the war, the progress of the Greek army on the Epirus front has not been surprising, but it has been steady and solid. In the past 48 hours, the Greek army has advanced more than ten kilometers along the entire line. The Greek army has continuously launched attacks at various points and has already divided the Italian Eleventh Army into several small teams. This is the same tactic used in the attack on Korytsa. It was also announced yesterday by the British General Headquarters here that British air force bombers had damaged important bridges and destroyed many sections of a highway used by Italian troops in southwestern Albania to transport their reinforcements. Despite heavy anti-aircraft fire, British planes still flew low to bomb. Military buildings in the Ftelini area were also heavily damaged. (3rd day United Press telegram)

Anti-Italian Rebellion Spreads in Albania; Italian Rear Threatened

Italians Claim Victory in Counterattack; Holding Coastal Bases in Albania

Rome: An Italian military bulletin said that the fierce attacks by all Greek armies have been repelled. The Greek army suffered heavy losses. Italian armies are now using the most powerful heavy artillery to counterattack the Alpine Squad, destroying Greek cavalry. Prime Minister Mussolini has now allocated an additional US$70 million for the military to increase reinforcements. In the Argirocastro area, the Greek army is attacking Italian hastily constructed defensive works with all its might, and the attacking forces seem to have an entire army corps. But the Italian army stands firm and counterattacks. Both sides have suffered heavy losses, making it the most fierce and bloody battle since the start of the war. (3rd day United Press telegram)

Rome: This afternoon, the Italian military headquarters announced that the Greek army and the Italian 9th and 11th Divisions are fighting fiercely. One side attacks and the other side counterattacks, neither side is falling behind. Italian planes are flying low to bomb enemy transportation.

Scottish Highlanders Brave and Good at Fighting; Three Reasons for Slow Advance

London: Forty-eight days have passed since Italy's war against Greece. A military expert here recently discussed the Greek-Italian war, praising the skillful command of the Greek generals and the brave resistance of the lower-ranking officers and soldiers, which resulted in great victories. It is said that after the Greek army captured Korytsa, unless the enemy attacked by way of Yugoslavia or Bulgaria, Salonika in Greece would not be in danger of direct attack. The Greek army's advance is now slowing down for three reasons: (1) The Greek army is now operating in very difficult and unfamiliar territory; (2) Its transportation lines are long and difficult to maintain; (3) Italian reinforcements have arrived. The expert also said that the Greek army has captured thousands of enemy troops. The Italian troops surrendered only after being surrounded and cut off from food. For example, an Italian Alpine regiment that invaded the Pindus Mountains was surrounded and surrendered only after being cut off from supplies for five days, which shows that the Greek army must fight hard to advance. British aid to Greece is not limited to air support or military equipment; British troops have recently participated in some decisive battles on the Italian-Greek front. (3rd day Reuters telegram)

### British Planes Bomb Italian Troops in Africa

Cairo: An aviation department intelligence agency said that the British Air Force continued to bomb the Italian ground and air forces gathered in Africa. The bombing of a large number of Italian aircraft at Punina in the western desert area destroyed two Italian 79-type three-engine bombers and severely damaged two others. British aircraft also bombed and strafed motor convoys on the road between Midama and Gondar in Italian East Africa. Four bombs hit transport vehicles, and strafing resulted in heavy casualties among enemy soldiers. Italian barracks in Walter Alataba and Midama were also bombed. The large barracks in the southern region of Khenisa was also hit and caught fire in many places. The Danchira barracks, which housed several large units of Italian colonial troops and Blackshirts, was attacked and set on fire at the end of the week, suffering heavy damage. British aircraft flying from Aden in November attacked Italian Eritrea and Abyssinia a total of five times, with the bombing of the port of Asab on the Red Sea being the most intense, with more than thirty attacks. British aircraft attacked the port of Asab for 36 hours. According to reports from pilots and reconnaissance officers, the port was heavily damaged and caught fire in many places. The railway between Addis Ababa and Djibouti was repeatedly bombed by British aircraft, making gasoline in Italian East Africa increasingly scarce. The British aircraft that launched the attacks flew thousands of miles and all safely returned to their original defenses. (3rd day Reuters telegram)

### Germany Stirs Up Trouble in Yugoslavia

London: A Reuters diplomatic correspondent said that according to recent news from Yugoslavia, Germany is now using its old tricks to stir up trouble in Yugoslavia. Germany is doing this because it has failed to induce the Yugoslav government to join the Axis, as Romania has done. It is generally believed that the bomb that exploded on the doorstep of the residence of Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister Maček was provided by German agents. Some even believe that Germany used Croats to carry out this despicable act. Fortunately, the bomb does not appear to have injured anyone, and the impact of this incident is likely to be the opposite of what the instigators expected. Since Prince Paul, the regent of Yugoslavia, reached an agreement with Maček, there has been a trend towards closer ties between the Croats, Serbs, and Slovenes in Yugoslavia. This explosion may be the starting point of a German action to disrupt the nerves of the Yugoslav people, but its success is unlikely to be better than the Italian invasion of Greece. It is felt that the Greek example has had a resonance in the Balkan Peninsula, which is of great help in defeating the Axis powers' conspiracy. (3rd day Reuters telegram)

### German Submarine Activity off the Coast of Ireland: British Escort Fleet Attacked, Sends SOS; Germans Claim to Have Sunk Over Ten British Ships

New York: Yesterday, this station received continuous submarine attack signals and SOS signals. It is said that several, or perhaps ten, British and neutral merchant ships off the coast of Ireland were jointly bombed by submarines and aircraft. This shows that in the recent past, Germany's attacks on British shipping have been quite successful. According to intercepted telegrams, six ships claimed to have been hit by torpedoes, two said they had been bombed, and another only said "Rescue quickly," indicating at least three ships are sinking. One of them was the "Lock Ranza," which reported that before being hit by a torpedo, it had rescued sailors from another sunken ship. It is said that the attacks came from all directions and were frequent, indicating that there were quite a few German submarines active. Judging from the SOS signals received, there may have been three escort convoys under attack. Also, because the attack site was less than 400 miles from the Irish coast, British warships and aircraft are believed to have rushed to the rescue. (Third, International News Agency Telegraph)

New York: Mackay Radio reports that twelve ships, mostly British, are currently being torpedoed or bombed by aircraft in the eastern half of the Atlantic, and are now sinking or sending SOS signals. The agency received reports that German submarines fired on the British freighter "Victoria," at 56 degrees 04 minutes North latitude and 13 degrees 30 minutes 0 seconds West longitude. An unidentified ship has also been hit. Among the ships sending SOS signals received by Mackay Radio are the 12,247-ton "Ross," hit by a torpedo at 6:55 AM; the 4,958-ton "Lock Ranza"; the 1,937-ton "Shen Tu," bombed at 10 AM; the "Kilgilan Castle" hit at 7:35 AM; and the 1,641-ton "Victoria" hit at 2:55 AM at night. German dive bombers attacked British ships off Scotland and Ireland, and submarines attacked a convoy 400 miles west of Ireland. Among the ships hit were the "Grande Dame" and the "Goodly," as well as another unidentified ship. (Third, United Press Telegraph)

### German Air Force Groups Attack Britain: Southampton Suffers Disaster; Fires Still Burning, Everywhere Debris; Bristol Port Bombed Again

Southampton: Last night, 200 German bombers raided Southampton, encountering strong anti-aircraft fire. Losses included several churches, one theater, several movie theaters, several banks, and many shops and residences. The destruction of the commercial district has left hundreds of unemployed in the city. (Third, United Press Telegraph)

London: An Air Ministry communiqué stated that last night's Nazi air raids were concentrated on Bristol, with few bombs falling elsewhere. The air raid on Bristol began shortly after nightfall and was quite large in scale, only weakening by midnight. Fires broke out in several places, and residences, shops, and public buildings suffered significant damage. There were some casualties among the residents. East Anglia and a few other locations were also bombed, with minor damage and casualties. One British fighter plane was destroyed yesterday, but the pilot escaped safely. (Third, Reuters Telegraph)

London: This area was not raided all night, but this morning, residents had barely woken up when enemy aircraft swooped down from the clouds and dropped nine bombs in a certain area. Three bombs fell on open ground, and the rest fell on the road, causing slight damage to houses on both sides, but no casualties. (Third, Reuters Telegraph)

Southampton: Southampton has become a ruin today after being bombed for eight hours with thousands of highly incendiary bombs. (Information issued by the Air Ministry in London stated that there were approximately 370 deaths and injuries in the Nazi air raids.) Within half a mile along High Street, only broken walls and piles of rubble are visible. The harbor area has also suffered the same disaster. More than ten places in the city have been razed to the ground, trees have been uprooted and broken, and power lines are tangled. Groups of homeless refugees are pouring out of the city. Trucks equipped with loudspeakers are patrolling the city, informing citizens of the aftermath measures. Troops have arrived in the city to assist the police and air defense personnel in maintaining order. Six or seven large churches have been completely destroyed, leaving only a few remaining walls. It is conceivable that incendiary bombs fell like rain on the green grass of the parks. (Third, United Press Telegraph)

Berlin: According to German aircraft returning from reconnaissance over Southampton, the harbor facilities there are still burning. There are three large fires in the southeastern part of the city, and over twenty smaller fires. (Third, Huitong Telegraph)

Berlin: Regarding the bombing of the British port of Southampton by the German Air Force from Sunday night to early Monday morning, Dr. Keller, a German war correspondent who witnessed the event, said that batches of German aircraft continuously dropped all types of bombs on key points in the city. The light from the bombs on the ground was no different from the starlight in the sky. Warehouses, barracks, houses, and factories caught fire one after another, and thick smoke swirled upwards. Anti-aircraft guns on the ground roared in succession, and hundreds of searchlights swept the sky. The explosion of shells in the air was like a grand fireworks display. The flares dropped by German aircraft further enhanced the various lights. Every second there was the sound of bombs exploding, and flames and black smoke followed. We could glimpse the iron skeletons of the factories that had been burned. The riverside docks and the Vickers aircraft motor factory were all engulfed in a sea of fire. The oil pools nearby spewed thick smoke. Below the German aircraft was a true scene of a large city heading towards destruction. (Third, Huitong Telegraph)

Berlin: This morning, German reconnaissance planes flew over Southampton to inspect the results of the German aircraft's attacks the night before. It is said that the thick smoke from the city could be glimpsed from Cherbourg in eastern France. The airspace along the English Channel was also shrouded in black smoke. As Southampton is a gasoline import port, the number of large oil pools and oil depots destroyed by fire must be numerous. It is said that a total of one million tons of gasoline was imported into the UK through the port in 1937. (Third, Huitong Telegraph)

### British Aircraft Fly Over Germany and Italy: Conduct Retaliatory Bombings

London: The British Air Force has been very successful in attacking German ships and submarines. Another team of British aircraft bombed Italy. Last night, British bomber squadrons again raided German submarine bases in the Bay of Biscay. At the same time, coastal command aircraft also set off to bomb German ships off the coast of Norway, directly hitting one of them. A German supply ship north of Bergen was also hit. All British aircraft returned without incident. (Third, Reuters Telegraph)

London: An Italian communiqué broadcast today acknowledged that Naples and Voghera had been bombed by British aircraft, causing large fires. According to German news agency reports, a snowstorm in the Adriatic Sea caused a disaster, and an Italian ship ran aground. There was also a heavy snowstorm in the Black Sea. There was heavy snowfall in Yugoslavia last weekend, and snow accumulated to about five feet in some parts of Albania, causing considerable disruption to air operations. (Third, Reuters Telegraph)

### Hitler's Gloom

Noguès, having Gilot's preemptive words, refused to receive these two British special envoys, nor did he allow them to meet with the dignitaries on the Massilia. From the moment they arrived in Casablanca, they were kept under surveillance. They flew back to London in despair. Their mission had failed.

The importance of their mission was something the French could not know. Their failure was truly tragic! The British intelligence had intercepted a secret German telegram, which contained the terms of the German-French armistice, stipulating that the French warships stationed at Oran must be handed over to Germany. Their trip was to inquire about the truth of this telegram.

The British later learned that the telegram was a cunning trick by the Germans. If General Noguès had been willing to receive Gott and Twiggou-Cuber, this trick could have been exposed earlier. Alas, they were turned away in Casablanca, further convincing them of the authenticity of the telegram.

Because of this misunderstanding, the British fleet sailed to Oran on July 3rd and presented the French fleet with an ultimatum, demanding a response within six hours. The French fleet, unwilling to violate the orders of the Pétain government, refused to accept the conditions. The British fleet then opened fire, sinking and damaging several French warships, with hundreds of soldiers killed.

Judging from this incident, the French fleet was completely unprepared for defense and had no intention of leaving Oran. According to French naval officers, they had long been ordered to keep the ships in port and had begun to dismantle the gun positions and engines.

At that time, there was no doubt that the French fleet was fervently pro-British. If the Pétain government had ordered the fleet to be handed over to Germany or Italy, it would have caused a rebellion. If Britain had waited a week or two, the truth would have become clear.

The sinking of the French fleet in Oran was generally hailed as a great British victory. However, the Germans could also boast that it was another German victory. The hope of many French people to continue resisting Germany sank to the bottom of the sea along with the French fleet. General Noguès therefore unhesitatingly re-arrested Mantel and ordered the Massilia to sail to Marseille immediately, allowing no one to stay except Daladier.

Noguès had always respected Daladier and did not want to send him back to France to die. Therefore, he allowed the former prime minister to "seclude himself in the universe" for several weeks. During this "seclusion" period, Daladier's friends also tried their best to help him escape to the United States or South America.

However, Daladier did not want to live as a fugitive. His departure from France was not to save his own life, but to save the life of the nation. At that time, the French National Committee had been established in London under the leadership of military expert General Teger. He felt that there was no other way to save the country except to go to London. Although Teger's talent was respected, he was unknown both domestically and abroad and was not enough to make a broad appeal to the French people. However, Daladier's name was known to all. The French knew very little about Teger's name, so he could not come forward. The French agricultural and commercial circles, although deeply jealous and disgusted with a group of bureaucratic politicians, placed their hopes on Daladier alone. He was called the "moderate Frenchman," possessing all the virtues and faults unique to the French. Daladier was confident that once he rose to lead the French National Committee, he would revitalize the pro-war camp, something Teger could not hope to match.

Although Noguès was very willing to have Daladier go far away, he was unwilling to let him go to London. One day, a Portuguese seaplane landed in Casablanca, preparing to take Daladier away, but because of an order from Noguès, Daladier failed to make the trip.

One day, a Greek freighter agreed to take Daladier, but at the last moment, Daladier suddenly felt that the matter was too dangerous and suddenly changed his mind. Daladier's friends had exhausted their intelligence and strength and could do nothing but write to the British Ambassador to Spain, Sir Hoare, and the Governor of Gibraltar, requesting that a British cruiser be sent to pick him up. However, they waited and waited, but there was no sign of the cruiser.

Daladier's friends said to him: "You can't run to England. Now you should go to America, this is the only remaining chance." But Daladier still insisted as before, refusing to go anywhere other than England. Noguès finally ran out of patience and arrested him one and a half months later.

Although Daladier and his kind failed, it cannot be said that the internal conflict in France has subsided. As the German-British war situation was uncertain, they tried to wipe out all strongly anti-German and pro-British individuals or groups. They also used various propaganda methods to win over the French to support the "New European Order" in the German style.

After Germany defeated the French army this summer, it focused all its efforts on this work, and it is no wonder that it took two months to do so. They also had to take the same measures in the Netherlands, Belgium and other occupied countries, but on a smaller scale and in a slightly different form. The Balkan countries require even more effort from Germany and constant attention. And the Soviet Russian "white bear" cannot be ignored. The Germans have tasted the bitterness of establishing and ruling a vast empire for the first time.

By August 11th, Germany launched an air force blitz against the British Isles. But according to our observations from behind the German front lines, the British air war at this time was still just one part of the war of attrition, and the main battlefield for the German army was still on the European continent.

Within the German front lines, there are no fewer than 100 million non-Germans harboring resentment. Although the leaders of the National Socialist Party know that the people of the occupied countries must be able to endure for the time being, this dissatisfaction is like buried dynamite, with the possibility of exploding anytime, anywhere. To keep them enduring, they must be closely monitored, even using food, work, or personal safety as bait.

What Germany is undertaking is a huge and dangerous task. After painstaking efforts, they have seized a vast Europe with lightning speed, but Germany still lacks the strength to concentrate all its efforts on launching a fatal blow against the British Isles. Germany knows this, and the British know it too. This is why Germany has not yet taken the offensive against Britain.

### Frequent Civil Wars in Various Regions of Romania; German Troops Stationed in Romania Hold a Grand Review; Opposition Politicians Flee One After Another

Bucharest: The civil unrest in Romania continues unabated. The first major event yesterday was the burning of a large number of official documents in the Propaganda Ministry building. The second major event was King Michael's appearance before the public during the parade of German troops. This was the first time the Romanian King had appeared since the outbreak of terrorist activities. After the parade, King Michael immediately went to his secret hiding place under tight protection. Romanian leader General Antonescu met with army generals during the day. It is said that Antonescu hesitated during the meeting about officially announcing a military dictatorship. It is rumored that if Antonescu takes this step, the Iron Guard will openly declare war. The Iron Guard has requested Archbishop Nicolescu of the Romanian Church to officially declare the deceased founder of the Iron Guard, Corneliu Zelea Codreanu, a saint, but when Nicolescu refused this request, it caused quite a stir among the general public. It is reported that the entire regions of Ploiești, Constanța, and Galați are under the control of terrorists, the majority of whom are Iron Guard members. The fire in the Propaganda Ministry building is believed to have been caused by incendiary bombs, as an explosion occurred in the archives room at the beginning of the fire. Many government officials are said to have advised General Antonescu to order the disarmament of the Iron Guard, but it is reported that Antonescu is still hesitant to take this action. Antonescu apparently feels that the army may not obey an order to confiscate the Iron Guard's weapons. It was also heard that the government has requested the National Church to accept some of the principles put forward by the Iron Guard. The Iron Guard has submitted a memorandum to the religious conference, containing thirty points, requesting the Greek Church to "adapt to the times." (International Telegram, 3rd)

Rome: This morning, the Romanian government issued a statement saying that it recognizes rumors of disturbances occurring within Romania. This move is apparently aimed at rumors about the unstable internal situation in the country. Some people here believe that the grand celebration of the 22nd anniversary of the union of Romania and Transylvania held in Alba Iulia is a unanimous expression of the people and military and political organs at all levels.

Bucharest: To celebrate Romania's entry into the Tripartite Pact, German troops stationed in Romania held a military parade in Bucharest at noon yesterday. The German troops departed from the Air Force Memorial Hall, and a large number of people gathered along the way. At 12:00 noon, the German troops marched past the reviewing stand, where the national flags of Germany and Romania were hung high. On the stand were King Michael, General Antonescu, Iron Guard leader Horia Sima, German Minister to Romania Fabrizius, German military commanders, and other guests. A battalion of the Romanian Army led the reviewed troops, followed by a motorized unit commanded by Lieutenant General Rossky of the German Army Group, then German infantry, artillery, signal corps, engineers, armored vehicles, and anti-aircraft artillery units. At the same time, German air force squadrons were also flying in the air. The most eye-catching among the reviewed troops were the heavy artillery and armored vehicles. The German infantry marching in formal formation were also noteworthy. Although only a portion of the German troops stationed in Romania participated in the review, it took more than an hour to complete the review. (Haitong News Agency Telegram, 3rd)

Bucharest: After the fascist Iron Guard in Romania massacred a large number of politicians, important figures in the opposition political circles feared being targeted and fled the country one after another. For example, former Prime Minister Tatarescu has already crossed the border and fled to Yugoslavia. Other important figures have also taken refuge in the Interior Ministry building upon hearing the news and have not yet returned home. The residence of National Peasant Party leader Maniu has been protected by the police to prevent attacks by Iron Guard members. In addition, according to the latest news, the capital of Romania and various provinces have returned to normal. In the past three days, no further accidents have occurred. Rumors that a riot occurred somewhere yesterday are completely unfounded. (Havas News Agency Telegram, 2nd)

Iron Guard members are prohibited from wearing uniforms except when attending ceremonies and inside the Bucharest headquarters. The headquarters of the group has recently issued an order instructing all leaders to pay attention to avoiding all means deemed unpatriotic. (Reuters Telegram, 3rd)

### Roosevelt Signs Philippine Constitution Amendment; Quezon's Re-election as Philippine President Seems Promising

Washington: The White House announced that U.S. President Roosevelt has signed the amendment to the Philippine Constitution. This is the first decision to amend the Philippine Constitution. After signing, the President set off for the Caribbean Sea for a defense inspection tour. This amendment stipulates that the Philippine President's term of office is four years, and he may be re-elected once. The original article stipulated that the President's term of office was six years, limited to one term. The parliamentary system has been changed from a unicameral system to a bicameral system. Philippine Senate President Elpidio Quirino, who has resided in the United States for a long time, will rush back to Manila after this decision is signed by the U.S. President to prepare for the opening of Congress in early January. After signing the President immediately boarded a train to Florida, from where he will board the cruiser Tuscaloosa to inspect defenses in the Caribbean Sea.

### New U.S. Weapon Supplied to Britain

Washington: The U.S. Army Air Corps has transferred to the British Air Force a new device for capturing maps of enemy countries in the night sky. This device was invented after fifteen years of research. It is said to be a kind of magnesium light that can be used for night photography. According to experts, this device will be very valuable to the British Air Force because it can detect military targets and limit the damage caused by aerial bombardment. (Reuters Telegram, 3rd) region will obtain one or two military bases from Britain. (United Press Telegram, 3rd)

Manila: Philippine political and business figures now believe that the greatest result of President Roosevelt's approval of the Philippine Constitution amendment may be to allow President Quezon to be re-elected. According to the original Philippine Constitution, the Philippine President's term of office is six years and cannot be re-elected, while this amendment stipulates that the President's term of office is four years and he may be re-elected once. This amendment will allow President Quezon to be re-elected and prepare the Philippines for its final independence during the next difficult four years. Philippine figures also stated that President Roosevelt's approval of the Philippine Constitution amendment is sufficient to indicate that he is reiterating the U.S. policy of guaranteeing the Philippines the greatest freedom to govern its internal affairs.

### Wu Jinglue Teaches Guqin

Wu Jinglue from Yushan, alias Xiaosheng Qinyunshizhuren, has a deep understanding of ancient music and is extremely proficient in qin studies. He has developed the qin art to the extreme, playing ancient tunes and restoring the original sounds. When he plays, the sound of the qin evokes images of flowing water and towering mountains, like Cheng Lian on the sea, moving people's emotions. At a time when elegant music is declining, reviving this art will undoubtedly benefit the world and people's hearts. Famous figures in Shanghai, such as Shen Enfu, Zhang Yipeng, Pang Yuanji, and Wang Qingmu, feared that the art would be lost and urged him to teach and preserve the ancient music. It is now heard that he has reluctantly agreed to their request and set up a lecture hall at the Jinye School on Baker Road, Daxing Road, so that those who are interested in this art can inquire.

### Second Youth Charity Basketball Match; Guoyou to Play Against McLein's Officers; Still at the Youth Hall This Saturday at 7 PM; Women's Basketball Exhibition Game Before the Match: Youyou vs. Jingwu

The Sports Department of the Youth Association, in order to raise funds for the Christmas Children's Charity Party, invited top Chinese and Western men's and women's basketball teams to participate in charity basketball games last week. At that time, McLein's officers promised to play another game. Now, Liu Hesheng of the Sports Department of the association has arranged for Guoyou to play against them. The game is scheduled to be held at the same place this Saturday (the 7th) evening. Before the game, the Youyou team will play against Jingwu. The officers' team easily defeated Shanghai Star last week, and their strong fighting power has deeply impressed the general audience. With Henshawitz's outstanding performance, it is even more rare. The Guoyou team was one of the top three in Shanghai the year before last and has players such as Li Zude, Chen Bangzhen, and Bao Songyuan. In the previous challenge match, they lost to Paramount by only one point. They are brave and good at fighting. It can be seen that their skills are still good. This time, they are determined to play against the officers. Wang Nanqun and Gao Baosheng are determined to play and serve their mother team, so the lineup is even more complete. In the women's game, Youyou has top-notch players such as Zhang Pei, Liu Zhenbao, and Huang Mingyuan. Jingwu has Li Yunzhi, Rong Shujian, and Xi Xun. Both sides are evenly matched in strength. They have met twice before in amateur volleyball and the Guangshi Cup opening exhibition game. The two teams each won once and both won by one point. This is the third time they have met, and it is difficult to predict who will win. Tickets are still sold for two yuan and are available for pre-sale at the association's inquiry office from today. The schedule for the two games is as follows: Youyou vs. Jingwu (Women's Exhibition) at 7:00 PM; Guoyou vs. McLein's Officers (Men's Exhibition) at 8:00 PM.

### New Six Cup Top Six Replay: Evening Glow Defeats Hualian; Huayi Jia to Play Xinya Tonight

The fourth act of the New Six Cup Table Tennis Tournament was held at 7:00 PM the night before at the ball room on the third floor of Zhejiang Xingye Bank. The newly formed third-place team, Hualian, played against the runner-up of the sixth group, Evening Glow Jia. Both teams are rising stars with similar strengths. Hualian made a mistake in the lineup arrangement, so Evening Glow broke them one by one and won five points in a row. Hualian only relied on Zhu Shihai to defeat Ding Zhiming of Evening Glow in straight sets to get one point. As a result, Hualian was defeated by Evening Glow Jia by a score of one to six. Tonight at 7:00 PM, Huayi Jia will play against Xinya at the same place. The former won the Zongjing Cup runner-up and has a strong lineup. The latter is a strong team that has emerged as a dark horse and has a complete team of talents. However, Huayi's hope of winning is stronger. Tickets are all priced at 30 cents.

(Huayi Jia): Zhang Zhihong, Chuan Qifang, Yu Lingxiao, Liu Ziyan, Xue Xinchu, Gui Weimin, Zheng Jingzhen, Guo Ren, Li Jiequan.

(Xinya): Luo Neng, Zhao Chao, Huang Shaosong, Li Shaoguang, Chen Shaoping, Wei Zhenhua, Yang Hanhong, Li Wenchic, Chen Zaixian, Peng Guisheng.

### Guoqiang Middle School Promotes Center Ball Game

Although the "Goal-hi" novel basketball game, which was popular in the American sports world this summer, was promoted by Mr. Bolato, the director of the Western Youth Sports Department, after returning to Shanghai, very few schools in the city responded. It is learned that Guoqiang Middle School on Aiwenyi Road will be the first to hold an experimental inter-class competition. This interesting, safe, and beneficial new type of exercise is indeed suitable for junior high school students and women. However, the original name "Goal-hi" (transliteration) seems inappropriate for application in China, so the school has temporarily translated it as "Center Ball", which seems more accurate and meaningful, because the goal of the ball is appropriately at the center of the field. The rules of the game are roughly similar to basketball, except that the penalty kick, start of the game, dribbling, hitting, and rotation are slightly different. The area of the court is only half that of an ordinary basketball court (detailed in this newspaper on November 9). Therefore, this sport is extremely suitable for schools with "small courts and many people" on the current isolated island. Even the promotion to families or neighborhoods is extremely needed. The inter-class competition held by the school is divided into ten groups and stipulates that students whose monthly test scores are unqualified are not allowed to participate in order to cultivate the purpose of emphasizing both academics and sports. If schools in the city need the competition rules, they can ask the school's sports director Huang Zhenming or Qian Xucang, who can tell you everything in detail.

### Peicheng Women's Table Tennis: Three Games This Afternoon

The Peicheng Cup All-School Senior Group Individual Table Tennis Championship, hosted by Peicheng Girls' High School, held the first round-robin tournament last Wednesday. It will continue in the auditorium at 4:00 PM this afternoon. Feng Huizhu will play against Gui Rongzheng, Zhang Lizhi, Zhang Xia and other three generals in a row. Feng has a stable ball style, and the two Zhangs are probably not her enemies. Today's only strong enemy is Gui Rongzheng, who is also good at cutting the ball, and there will be a fierce battle at that time. If Feng wins all three today, she will compete with Feng Mingyin for the championship. At present, Feng Mingyin has the most hope of winning the championship. Today's order is Feng Huizhu vs. Zhang Xia; Feng Huizhu vs. Zhang Lizhi; Feng Huizhu vs. Gui Rongzheng.

### Student Union Cup Table Tennis: Competition Begins Today

Since the registration for the Student Union Cup Table Tennis Tournament, 17 teams have participated, including Jiaotong, Datong, Fudan (two teams), Zhendan, Xiaoshi, Youth Association, Guangxia, Xinshi, Cansi, Fushi, Fuzhong, Sanyu, Nanyang, and Wuzhong.

Shanghai students from Yinhuo University, including Shi Zhongkang, Zhang Zhongchun, Feng Zaisheng, Cai Ruisheng, Tang Linkang, and Xu Xiangsheng, organized the Huaqing Football Club. At the end of last month, they held an inaugural meeting at the Jinghua Restaurant. Xue Weihan was elected to be responsible for promotion, and German physical education expert Ge was hired as a guide. A communication address was set up at P.O. Box 1412. Students from other schools are welcome to join.

### Food: Prices Rise Several Yuan Continuously for Several Days; Rice Will Soon Cost One Yuan per Sheng; People's Food Situation Has Reached an Extremely Critical Stage; Is Just Watching Without Helping Intended to Harm All Living Beings?

The rice market is in a fever of speculation and is becoming increasingly chaotic. The entry and competitive buying of new hoarding households from outside the industry and the price increases of the consignors seem crazy, and they no longer care about the condemnation of righteousness or general advice. Yesterday, foreign rice rose sharply in the morning and even more so in the evening, increasing by three, four, or five yuan. After the market opened in the morning, rumors became more and more intense, and buying became more and more frenzied. The prices of each grade rose sharply. Saigon No. 1 rose to 84 yuan, and No. 2 rose to 80 yuan and 7 jiao, an increase of two or three yuan compared to the previous day. In the afternoon, off-market trading rose higher and higher. No. 1 was still short of sales at 85 or 86 yuan, and No. 2 Pagoda Brand even reached 83 yuan, which was four or five yuan higher. Since the official announcement of Jardine Matheson's order has not been made, it is said that many orders for Burmese rice have been placed recently, and all are direct transactions. There are few official announcements on the market, so the hoarding is even more unusual. The entire market only has more than 300 tons as a decoration. No. 1 in December is 95 yuan and 5 jiao, and No. 2 in November is 93 yuan, and in December it is 92 yuan, rising to 93 yuan in the afternoon. Spot goods were quoted high but not opened in the afternoon, and less than 20,000 bags were transacted in spot trading due to hoarding. The prices include Saigon No. 1 at 84 yuan and 83 yuan, No. 2 at 80 yuan and 7 jiao and 80 yuan, Fire Twist at 82 yuan and 4 jiao and 80 yuan, No. 2 Weiqi at 78 yuan and 5 jiao and 77 yuan and a half, Small Twist at 77 yuan and a half and 77 yuan and 2 jiao, Tokyo Top at 72 yuan and 2 jiao and 70 yuan, Rice Bran at 70 yuan, Medium at 69 yuan, Broken Special at 69 yuan and 5 jiao, and Secondary at 67 yuan, Wuhu Top at 71 yuan and a half, and Machine Top at 75 yuan and a half.

Since the transportation of new japonica and thin rice domestic rice from the Hongkou district has been blocked for several days, the source has been cut off, and the price has become more unusual, and the price has skyrocketed, increasing by as much as three or four yuan. The prices are now new japonica at 98 yuan per hu, and thin rice in original packages at 98 yuan, and 95 yuan to 93 yuan per hu.

The sales of glutinous rice have been slightly slower, but the stock is insufficient, and the market is tight. Kaiyi Li Special Yuan is 95 yuan, Ordinary is 92 or 3 yuan, Hong Kong White Yuan is 85 or 6 yuan, and Medium is 80 yuan.

Foreign rice arrived in Shanghai again yesterday. The Taikoo Company's Qingyuan Wheel brought 3,745 bags from Hong Kong and arrived at the port yesterday afternoon, docking at the company's wharf in Pudong to unload. The price of rice in the city has reached this point, and 100 yuan per bag of japonica rice is already in sight. Although foreign rice arrives every day, the price of rice is frequently reported to be rising. The people's food situation has reached an extremely critical stage, and is still watching without knowing how to save it intended to harm all living beings? (Ancestor)

### The Increasing Trend of Foreign Flour

Flour: Yesterday, flour trading still centered on foreign flour. After more than 190,000 bags of Australian fine flour arrived at the end of last month, the market is now widely influenced by foreign flour. Even some of the cheaper flour from Chinese factories is using foreign flour as a substitute, a truly unprecedented situation. Therefore, consumers are paying attention to purchasing foreign flour. Consequently, the current price of the "Flower Bird Clock Tower" brand of foreign flour opened at $19.50 and rose to $19.85. Furthermore, the price of goods arriving at the beginning of this month was $19.60, an increase of 40 to 50 cents compared to the previous day. A total of 12,300 bags were transacted, with local and out-of-town buyers splitting the purchase equally. The wholesale price of Chinese flour remained at $18, with over 8,000 bags sold by two factories.

Wheat: Trading was quiet yesterday, but the market is trending subtly higher. The asking price for goods stored in concessions reached as high as $29. Chinese factories still find this price too high and are unwilling to buy. Japanese factories are still selling at the original price of $27, with slight increases in retail sales. There are still scattered deliveries from factories, two to three hundred bags, all of which are prepaid futures, with agreed prices also around $27.

### Miscellaneous Grains: Soybean Oil Prices Are Being Manipulated More Intensely

As reported in this newspaper the previous day, speculation in rice and silkworm cocoons has spread to miscellaneous grains. Yesterday, this trend became even more active, especially in the oil market, where waves of speculation reached the sky, and the rising trend spread everywhere. Short sellers in the industry have reversed course and gone long, causing the price of raw soybean oil to suddenly increase by a huge $3-4. The soybean market has also been driven up by about one dollar due to such manipulation. A large number of transactions took place in the market, including 300 dan of factory-produced soybean oil, 80 pieces of Yantai soybean oil, 250 pieces of Jiaozhou soybean oil, 700 pieces of raw oil, 50 pieces of Yantai raw oil, 100 cans of Jiangbei new raw oil, 60 barrels of Qingdao raw oil, another 1,000 barrels of the near term, and 600 barrels of forward contracts. There were also 1,000 bags of Qingdao soybeans, 700 bags of Tianjin Jinyuan soybeans, 40 bags of Chongming sand soybeans, and 50 bags of Pudong Doudou soybeans. Inspections show that sales transactions were very few.

### Sugar Market: Diaoqing Sugar, Long Dormant, Shows Signs of Movement

Due to the "removal certificate" requirements for domestic sugar, not only has there been no opening for a long time, but the source has also been lacking, making the market extremely quiet. There have been no transactions for more than two months. Yesterday, Jianbang sugar finally started to open with a batch of 110 bags of Gaozhang Diaoqing sugar, priced at $63.50, only about $3 less than in late September, which is still considered stable. There were slight fluctuations in the public market's allocation. Spot prices for No. 24 coarse white sugar remained at $73 at the warehouse. Spot prices for Dutch red sugar were $56.70-56.80, and the 10th-day warehouse order was $57, up 20-30 cents. Taikoo Car White B mark was $76.10, up 30 cents. DY mark East warehouse was $70.20, up 20 cents. HX mark West warehouse initially sold for $70.20, and East warehouse was $70, but later also reached $70.20.

### Dried and Preserved Goods: Large Slices of Dried Longan Increase by $3

Since the price of large slices of dried longan decreased, merchants have tried to recover more than ten dollars, but the goods arriving at stores have faced extra fees from Xiamen, leading to a stalemate. Also, the number of arrivals is not large. Therefore, the result of maintaining this stalemate is a positive trend. It is said that a few boxes have recently been sold, with an increase of three dollars compared to before.

### Finance: Foreign Exchange Favors Sellers, Atmosphere Increasingly Strong

The foreign exchange market yesterday showed no changes in HSBC's listed rates. In the gray market for British and American exchange rates, the United States' strong support for China created a strong bearish atmosphere. With people feeling this way, the market loosened, especially with Hong Kong Electric and other companies selling a large amount. However, because Chinese banks were willing to absorb, the loosening trend was slow. It is expected that the future will continue to be long. In the current environment, there are still rumors stimulating people's minds. Some operators are hesitating. At the closing price today, British gold was quoted at 3 pence 765625, and the US exchange rate was $5.9375, an increase of 0.046875 and 0.0625 respectively compared to the previous day.

At the opening of the bank in the morning, the selling price for spot British gold was 3 pence 71875, and the US exchange rate was $5.8125, the same as the closing price of the previous day. After the opening, people's minds loosened, and Japanese banks first sold current US exchange at a favorable price of $5.875. Speculators and Hong Kong Electric also sold US exchange, further hardening the underlying trend. It is estimated that foreign and American banks have absorbed between $5.875 and $5.90625 this month. At the same time, Japanese banks sold some more current US exchange. It is estimated that American banks have absorbed at $5.90625. HSBC's listed rates were announced to be unchanged. The silver balancing tax was also reduced by 0.25%. Afterwards, speculators stopped selling and started buying, and the supply and demand gradually balanced, and the price also fluctuated for a while. It is estimated that this month, foreign banks sold US exchange to speculators at $5.875, and Chinese banks also gave speculators US exchange at $5.875 for the same month. The noon closing was calm. The spot price for British gold was 3 pence 75, and the US exchange rate was $5.875, an increase of 0.03125 and 0.0625 compared to the opening price in the morning.

Market Situation: Supply Exceeds Demand

The market situation in the afternoon remained unchanged. Chinese banks sold US exchange for this month to speculators at $5.90625. Later, bearish news came, and Hong Kong companies sold heavily. Although Chinese banks had a strong appetite for absorbing, the supply and demand were ultimately unbalanced. After that, foreign and Chinese banks uniformly quoted $5.9375 for US exchange for this month. The result of the evening closing was: spot and this month's British gold at 3 pence 765625, and the US exchange rate at $5.9275; next month's British gold at 3 pence 75, and the US exchange rate at $5.90625, an increase of 0.046875 for British currency and a decrease of 0.0625 for US currency compared to the previous day.

### Securities: Foreign Debt Rising Trend Increasing Daily, Domestic Debt Alone Shows Fluctuations

The securities gray market gradually entered a fluctuating path yesterday. After the success of the large loan, it did not show any effect, and was indeed affected by the adverse forces of the environment increasing secretly. Both long and short positions had a kind of suspicious and uncertain trend. In the market, most of the long positions were concentrated in Category C, and other various long positions were weaker. Yesterday, several hundred thousand units of Category B were sold, and the market price suddenly decreased. However, if this amount were applied to Category C, it would not have much effect. The future still depends on changes in the environment. Yesterday, Lianhe, Yitai, and Runli consistently sold in the morning and afternoon, with Lianhe selling the most Category B. Shunchang consistently bought in. Others, such as Hongda, Yongkang, Lianyi, Tongkang, Dingkang, and Shengda, all bought in, but the amount was not large. Erhao, Siyihao, and Runde still sold, so the market price was tired and could not rise. Both long and short positions were still maintaining their lines, and the overall strength was evenly matched, awaiting changes. As a result of the day, highs and lows were mixed by 5 cents and 10 cents, but Category B fell the most, by 40 cents. About 1.67 million units were traded. A brief summary is listed below. Also, starting today, the opening time in the morning will be moved forward by 15 minutes, to 9:30 AM. All begin selling.

However, this downward trend was not serious. Rubber stocks opened soft and closed stable, just like other parts of the market.

London, 2nd (Monday) dispatch: Today's listed prices for Chinese foreign debt and Far Eastern British company stocks: The rising trend of Chinese foreign debt was quite strong.

### Yarn and Cotton: Cotton Yarn Profits Emerge, Double Horse Retracts Slightly by $12

The yarn market, which had risen sharply the previous day, leveled off slightly yesterday, but the trend remained quiet. The rising trend was somewhat too violent. In general, those who made profits, seeing that the rising force had been set, spit out a little, causing a step back. But in reality, there is no big drop either. Because the factory's costs have increased, and the inventory is decreasing day by day. However, the factory's chips are somewhat more relaxed when encountering a sharp rise, and some are shorting. However, those who have sufficient capital to absorb the transferred goods are still not moving.

Because the popularity was tense in the afternoon of the previous day, the price opened at $1,255 for Double Horse in the morning, and the long positions were still high. As soon as this price opened, some of those who had made profits came out slightly, and the chips were slightly looser, and they saw a drop to $1,242. Then the foreign exchange rate was looser, and the floating long and hat-snatching people were active on the short side, and it continued to drop to $1,237. However, short sellers came to cover their positions at low prices, and it still rebounded to $1,245, and finally closed slightly flat at $1,240. According to the half-day transaction statistics, 6,270 bags were traded, and the price of 20-count Double Horse yarn fell by $12. The amount of purchases from each gang is listed as follows:

Same Trade 6,000 Hong Kong 245

Tianjin 25 Statistics 6,270

### Sources Difficult to Obtain: Cotton Merchants Maintain as Before

The current cotton situation has turned firm. Because the source is not smooth, Chinese factories have had better intentions recently because of the high price of yarn, and they sometimes purchase, so the price is also upward. The same trade is very fierce in maintaining the price. The price of Tongzhou American cotton is $239, the price of Brazilian cotton is $284, and the price of 火機 cotton is $206.

The market price of foreign cotton: The New York cotton market is firm and lively. The purchase of the same industry and the covering of some short positions resulted in a closing price of 2 pounds higher than the previous day. India has closed the market.

The transaction of foreign cotton in Shanghai has been very quiet recently. Japanese manufacturers made a small purchase yesterday, but it was a small transaction. Chinese manufacturers' willingness to purchase is still very weak.

### Yarn Market in Turbulence

— Zhong

The yarn market in the last two weeks can be said to have been infinitely variable. Considering its trend, it has finally cycled several times around $1,275 to $1,200. It began with the strong atmosphere of peace between China and Japan. The foreign exchange rate looked long, and the sellers were unusually active. On November 18, the price of Double Horse was $1,275, and it gradually decreased to $1,182 on the 23rd. As the price fell, the selling trend slowed slightly. It is estimated that most of the households with plenty of capital did not shake the multi-amount at the low peak, but instead dragged in, and the dryness of the chips had a significantly rising appearance. However, market discussions were numerous, saying that the huge amount of the Sino-American loan should be established, the position should be widened, and the market should be viewed as small. On November 28, Double Horse saw $1,198 again. Unexpectedly, at the opening on Monday, December 2, due to the announcement of the Sino-American loan, the popular heart was timid, the foreign exchange rate frequently lengthened, and the short positions were especially excited. The yarn market followed and fell. Unexpectedly, in a short while, the foreign exchange rate suddenly changed and contracted, and the current yarn market was stormy, and the buyers seemed to come like bees. The short side was greatly alarmed, and the straight line galloped up, jumping 40 yuan. The peak of Double Horse once reached $1,258. The author explores and adjusts the reasons for the rise in cotton yarn here, and makes a brief reference:

(1) Recently, the Double Horse short side has been unusually active. Because the US side has successfully loaned a large amount, the amount often thrown out exceeds the normal range, so it can't resist the reflection.

(2) The amount absorbed by large households in the same industry is never abandoned. Considering the reason, it is related to the factory's cost, and they are unwilling to sell it off. Moreover, the raw materials cannot be relaxed, and the source is difficult.

(3) The rumors have been extremely intense recently, saying that "a certain bank" will be established, and it is also said that the number of Japanese yarns banned from shipping to Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces has been completely opened. Therefore, the rise in Japanese yarn is stronger. After asking several times, it has not yet arrived when it is fully opened. However, the amount of shipping can be increased by a few percent compared to the past. For example, each unit in Jiangsu Province can ship 500 bags per day, and now it can ship 600 to 700 bags. The multi-party also said that the recent trend is also upward.

(4) Although the need in the southwest has no large-scale development, the purchase of 42-count and 32-count yarns is particularly healthy, and the current price of 20-count yarn is relatively cheap, so there are many who want to increase the price. The fundamental question is whether the actual sales are large or small, and the rise and fall of the yarn market is the first key.

### Piece Goods: Wenzhou and Taizhou Gangs Active in Handling Cloth

The trend of factory cloth was stable yesterday, because there is a saying that shipping in Wenzhou has returned to normal. After the passenger gangs shipped out the accumulated goods, new transactions gradually increased, and the demand for fine cloth and bleached cloth was the most frequent. The market gradually showed activity, and the selling price of fine cloth increased by 25 to 35 cents, and the selling price of coarse twill cloth increased by 10 to 25 cents. The price of Yihua Bleaching Factory has increased by 50 cents to 1 yuan across the board, and the price of spring fine yarn thread goods has also increased sharply. More than 1,000 pieces of various goods were traded on this street, and the Guangdong and Hong Kong gangs handled more than 400 pieces of colored cloth, bleached cloth, and coarse and fine cloth. The Zhejiang, Wenzhou, and Taizhou gangs handled more than 200 pieces of bleached and dyed cloth and coarse and fine cloth.

The selling price of the fine cloth of the East cloth leader has fallen back, taking the market price of 35 yuan and 60 cents per piece. The sales of mid-range fine cloth in this street are still strong, so it insists on not moving. The 四君子哔叽 also fell along with the leader because of retail sales, and the closing price was about 1 yuan and 9 cents.

### Hardware: Wire Rod Changes Selling Price Several Times in One Day

Nails: Previously, because the sales of this nails were blocked, they had temporarily become fatigued. However, since the recent two or three days, because the price of wire rods has risen daily, the cost of this nails has increased, and the asking price must also increase. In addition, there are both inland river merchants and business on this street, and the number of transactions is estimated to be 400 to 500 barrels. The actual sales have changed their old appearance, and people's hearts are naturally good. The asking price is high, and the price of each barrel of 倍司 was 55 yuan yesterday, an increase of 1 yuan.

Wire Rod: Yesterday, wire rod transactions were frequent, no less than 1,000 dan, so the market was strong. The industry's thoughts were strange and high, and the selling price changed several times in one day. The final price was 60 yuan, also an increase of one or two yuan compared to before. It is heard that the market is not lacking in goods, so there is no shortage of raw materials for nail factories, screw factories, and lead wire factories for the time being.

### The West Shanghai Blockade Shows No Sign of Loosening; Delegation Negotiates with the Japanese Side; Police Department and Japanese Military Police Discuss Matters; Hoping Restrictions of the Blockade Can Be Relaxed

According to the Information Office of the Shanghai Municipal Council, regarding the blockade of the area of the outer roads west of Shanghai, the Police Department has directly negotiated with the Japanese Military Police Headquarters, in order to relax the said blockade. The Municipal Council has also requested the leader of the Consular Body to negotiate to achieve the goal of relaxing the blockade.

The Leader of the Consular Body, Mr. Heale, stated that the Japanese Consul-General Horiuchi's attitude showed friendship and sympathy towards the residents, but in his reply at 2 p.m., he stated that the current restrictions are in place to search for the assassins who attacked the Japanese military police. Before the Japanese authorities deem it impossible to capture the assassins, the blockade cannot be lifted. Furthermore, according to a Japanese police officer assisting in the negotiations, the Japanese side replied that the blockade cannot be lifted for the time being and may continue for another two or three weeks.

Efforts from All Sides to Transport Food

According to the English-language Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury, the Japanese blockade of the "badlands" area west of Shanghai entered its fourth day yesterday (the 3rd) afternoon. The situation is serious. Foreign consuls stationed in Shanghai and police officers from the Shanghai Municipal Council are jointly meeting with the Japanese side to ease the restrictions imposed by the Japanese and allow food to be transported in to aid the countless Chinese residents who have been trapped in the area since Saturday and unable to leave or enter. The Danish Consul-General stationed in Shanghai, who also serves as the Leader of the Consular Body, Mr. Heale, met with the Japanese Consul-General Horiuchi yesterday afternoon. Before that, Mr. Heale had met with representatives from other consulates in order to explain the views of all foreigners when meeting with Horiuchi.

Soldiers with Bayonets Standing Guard as Before

It has been found that the Japanese implemented the blockade after a Japanese military police officer was stabbed on Saturday. Until yesterday morning, the blockaded area extended from Jing'an Temple to Yih Ting Pan Road and from Yu Yuan Road to Great West Road. Japanese soldiers with bayonets patrolled back and forth, preventing Chinese people from entering or leaving, and also prohibiting food from being delivered to the trapped residents. There are rumors that teachers and students from schools in the Western District will be allowed to enter and exit, but this has not been confirmed. However, all foreigners are allowed to pass through the barriers.

The Person Who Fired the Gun Has Likely Left the Country

According to residents of foreign nationality within the blockaded area, there are many inconveniences after the blockade. For example, they must bring their own newspapers and food. The obstruction of Chinese residents is nothing more than a means of extortion. Because the Chinese people can pay a bribe of one or two yuan to the guards, then they can enter and exit. If the person who fired the gun and attacked the Japanese soldier had one or two yuan, he would have left the blockaded area long ago.

Difficulties Reduced for British and American Nationals

At the same time, it is heard that the American Consulate has taken direct steps to ensure the interests of American nationals. An official from the American Consulate met with the Japanese Consulate side the day before yesterday. The Japanese side told them that American nationals would not encounter difficulties. It is also heard that the Shanghai Telephone Company delivered food and bedding for 85 Chinese and foreign employees of the Rue Siao-E-Tsan branch in the Western District the day before yesterday, and the Yun Fei Motor Company delivered daily necessities for employees of the branch station in the Western District. They were only allowed into the blockaded area after negotiations by American officials. Female employees of the Rue Siao-E-Tsan Telephone Branch have been trapped and working continuously since Saturday, with only four hours of sleep in sixty hours. It was not until yesterday morning that another group of female employees took over the shift and they were able to return home to rest. Furthermore, officials from the British Consulate stated that British nationals within the blockaded area had "one or two kinds of difficulties," which had been resolved after discussions with the Japanese side.

It Is Said One Can Pass After Paying a Bribe

The North-China Daily News reported that the Japanese military authorities blockaded the area of Great West Road and Yu Yuan Road because a Japanese military police officer was stabbed, and the blockade has not been lifted. Although the Japanese side has taken strict measures, prohibiting anyone from entering or leaving, it is heard that yesterday (the 2nd), some Chinese people crossed the blockade line and entered the Public Concession. It is said that they were allowed to leave the area after paying a bribe. Furthermore, according to well-informed sources, within minutes after the Japanese military police officer was stabbed at the entrance of Lane 52 on Great West Road, the Japanese side captured more than fifteen suspects near the lane, including a Russian who was wearing work clothes.

A Narrow, Dirty Lane Given a One-Time Exemption

The Japanese side has been implementing a blockade in the outer roads area west of Shanghai, prohibiting Chinese people from entering or leaving, for more than sixty hours. Yesterday, a lane was opened between Yu Yuan Road and Great Sifang Road, allowing people to enter and exit. The lane starts from Lane 668 on Yu Yuan Road, passes through a winding, dirty alley filled with garbage, and reaches Great Sifang Road. The sudden implementation of the blockade by the Japanese side has not only affected Chinese people, but also foreigners. It is heard that not a few foreigners in the area have not received milk and bread in the past two days, and there are patients who cannot get medical treatment.

West Shanghai Electrical Wire was Cut and Stolen Again

Yesterday morning, sixty yards of electrical wire in the Western District were cut and stolen, so the electricity in the area was cut off for one and a half hours. Personnel from the power company said they did not know who stole the electrical wire. As for nightclubs and other establishments in West Shanghai, although they are west of the blockaded area, customers can go there via Great Sifang Road and other routes, so business has not declined.

Rice Prices Are Alarming

Shops in the blockaded area have all been closed since the incident occurred, and have not yet reopened. All large and small gambling dens have also been closed. The area is now as silent as a dead city. Food prices have risen to several times their original price. According to residents who have just left the area, the price of rice in the area has risen to 160 yuan per picul, and there is still the suffering of having money but not being able to buy rice. The prices of other various foods and drinks have also risen several times, and residents are in danger of starvation.

### The Japanese Soldier Who Was Shot Has Already Died

The English-language Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury reports that the Japanese military police officer Sasaki, who was shot by an assassin near Lane 52 on Great West Road at 2:20 p.m. on Saturday, was first sent to the Hong En Hospital for treatment, and then transferred to Hongkou. He died of his injuries en route. After the Japanese military police officer was attacked, he was taken to the Hong En Hospital by a Westerner named White. Dr. Nance, a famous American doctor, immediately treated him. According to Dr. Nance, if surgery had been performed at that time, the life of the Japanese soldier could have been saved. However, before he could perform the surgery, the Japanese military authorities arrived at the hospital and ordered the wounded Japanese soldier to be immediately transferred to a certain hospital in Hongkou, which resulted in him dying en route. According to reports, Sasaki was patrolling Great West Road with two other Japanese military police officers at noon on Saturday when he was attacked. The assassin immediately escaped, and the Japanese side then implemented the blockade in the area.

### Six Young School Children Encounter a Tragic Fate; Sleeping on Wooden Benches at Night, Sustaining Themselves on Biscuits; The Situation Inside the Blockaded Area is Unimaginable

The English-language Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury reported that six students from the Shanghai Municipal Council Chinese Children's Public School on Yih Ting Pan Road in the Japanese military police blockaded area, ranging in age from six to ten, have been trapped inside the school and have lost contact with their parents for three days and nights. To this day, they are still sustaining themselves on biscuits and cannot return home. The six Chinese children left the school later than usual on Saturday afternoon and happened to encounter the sudden implementation of the blockade by the Japanese side, and were trapped in the school with five teachers. At night, they slept on wooden benches in the classroom, with only three or four blankets to keep them warm, because the Chinese Children's Public School does not have boarding facilities. According to reports, in addition to the Chinese Children's Public School, there are also the Municipal Council Elementary School and Middle School at No. 65 Great West Road, which are also blocked off.

A Maid Bitterly Laments the Suffering of Her Two Children

According to a Chinese maid, her husband has abandoned her and she is supporting five children. She lives in the blockaded area west of Shanghai and works as a maid for a foreign family in the French Concession. Since Saturday, she has been unable to cross the blockade line to return home, and has been staying at her employer's residence in the French Concession. The woman guesses that her three children are not trapped in the blockaded area and must be staying at a friend's house, but she has not been able to meet those three children. Her other two children, the youngest, are left alone at home in the blockaded area, without any food to eat. The suffering of these two children is unimaginable, so the woman is extremely anxious, but there is nothing she can do. There must be more than just this woman among the Chinese residents in the blockaded area who have encountered this tragic situation.

### Chinese Police Officers Request Improved Treatment; Terms Proposed Yesterday; To Be Submitted to the Authorities by Deputy Chief Yao; To Be Discussed and Decided Upon by the Board of Directors After It Is Convened

All Chinese police officers in the Public Concession, in order to request improved treatment, have appointed representatives to draft the terms to be submitted to the authorities. However, for the sake of caution, they were re-discussed and solemnly revised the day before yesterday. They have now formulated five main terms and fifteen supplementary terms. The terms have now been written in the format of a memorial and were officially submitted to the Chinese Deputy Chief of Police, Mr. Yao Tseng-mo, by the Chinese police representatives yesterday afternoon. Today, they should be received by Major Bowman, the Superintendent. After a preliminary consideration of the contents of the terms, he will forward them to the Director-General, Mr. Fessenden, and propose that they be discussed and decided upon at the Board of Directors meeting to be convened in the coming days. The authorities are very understanding of the Chinese police officers' request for improved treatment due to the pressure of life, and are willing to resolve it as soon as possible in order to reduce the suffering of the Chinese police officers' lives. The Chinese police officers, on the other hand, are working with peace of mind and waiting for a reply. With mutual sincerity between the two parties, this dispute should not be difficult to resolve satisfactorily in the shortest possible time.

Waiting Quietly for a Reply

All the representatives of the Chinese police officers deeply understand the overall situation, so all actions are carried out cautiously. Yesterday, after submitting the request to the authorities, they specially printed a notice to all the Chinese police officers and posted it in various police stations within the Concession. The original text is as follows: "It has been found that the reason for the occurrence of dereliction of duty is purely due to the high pressure of life. Fortunately, all colleagues are able to deeply understand the righteousness and take care of the overall situation, and are unwilling to disregard the safety of millions of citizens, so they have been able to obtain the infinite sympathy of all sectors of society. After the representatives appointed by the various police stations participated in the "Provisional Representative Committee," they jointly discussed the necessary conditions for improving life. After several deliberations, it was resolved and passed at 6 p.m. on the 2nd of this month that in addition to drafting the articles and submitting a request to the Police Department to be forwarded to the Engineering Board for approval and implementation, we deeply hope that our colleagues will follow the original intention and live up to the expectations of the citizens, and wait quietly for a reply. A reasonable solution should not be difficult to achieve. This is to inform everyone, the Chinese Police Provisional Representative Committee, December 3rd."

Not Difficult to Solve

The reporter from the Ta Chung News Agency revisited Mr. Yu Qiaqing, a Chinese Director, yesterday to inquire about the development of this issue. Mr. Yu expressed great optimism, saying that because the Chinese police officers are understanding of the difficult times and deeply understand the righteousness, and have agreed not to make other demands in addition to requesting improved treatment, the problem has become simplified. It is expected that the memorial from the Chinese police officers will be submitted to Superintendent Bowman of the Police Department tomorrow (i.e., today) and will be quickly considered. It should not be difficult to obtain a reasonable solution in a short period of time.

### Excellent Results in the Winter Clothing Donation Campaign; Commendation from the General Association; Although It Has Ended, Donations Are Still Being Paid

The Shanghai Branch of the National Winter Clothing Donation Committee, after being ordered to collect winter clothing donations starting from August 1st, originally set the amount of winter clothing donations to be collected in Shanghai at 500,000 national currency. Through the efforts of all sectors of society, the collection has been quite successful, and the total amount has exceeded the predetermined goal. It has now ended at the end of November. Donations were extremely enthusiastic. The amount of money donated by various industries totaled 500,000 yuan. For example, a certain industry alone recognized a donation of 100,000 yuan. As for the money donated by the cultural, educational, and industrial sectors, as well as individuals, it totaled 400,000 to 500,000 yuan. The total amount donated by Shanghai is close to one million. Although it has now reached the end of the period, various sectors of society are still entrusting banks to remit winter clothing donations to Chongqing. It is heard that the General Association highly commended the enthusiastic donations of the citizens of Shanghai, an isolated island, and has telegraphed Shanghai to commend the donors separately.

### Bean and Rice Industry Association Urgently Restricts Rice Prices; Authorities Instruct Rice Merchants to Order in Rotation; 100,000 Bags to Be Regularly Prepared to Meet Market Demand at Production Prices

Mr. Ho Te-kuei, Deputy Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council, invited three rice industry leaders, Mr. Chen Tzu-yi, Mr. Chu Tzu-hsiang, and Mr. Fu Chien-keng, the other day to discuss concrete measures. In addition to inquiring about the rice market situation, Mr. Ho will immediately instruct the rice merchants to expand their orders of 100,000 bags of rice at the production price to supply the market, and to order in rotation, so as to prevent the reduction of spot goods on the market. All the representatives recognized that this measure was the most urgent and promised to inform their colleagues to act accordingly.

Scheduled Consultation

In order to actively stabilize the entire food supply in Shanghai, it is heard that the two authorities have scheduled a joint meeting on the 10th of this month (Tuesday) at the Municipal Council on Jiangxi Road to convene rice industry leaders. Mr. Yu Qiaqing will be invited to attend. It is expected that the results of the meeting will lead to a formal decision on concrete measures to stabilize the entire food supply in Shanghai. At that time, Mr. Yu Qiaqing's suggestion to order foreign rice on a large scale will also be discussed at length. In order to stabilize the food supply in Shanghai, it depends on the two concession authorities to lead the way without fear of difficulties, as well as the joint cooperation of all sectors of society. Now that the authorities have this intention, it is expected that the panic over the food supply in Shanghai can be easily resolved.

Mr. Yu's Proposal

Regarding the food supply issue, due to the manipulation of unscrupulous merchants who hoard and speculate, rice prices rose sharply again yesterday by two yuan, breaking new records, and the situation is serious. However, according to Mr. Yu Qiaqing, citizens really do not need to panic, because Shanghai has 700,000 bags of rice in stock, which is more than enough to supply until February of next year. What Shanghai needs most at present is No. 2 Saigon, and the source has not been cut off. Furthermore, new Vietnamese rice can be put on the market at the end of December and the beginning of January. At that time, if the authorities can accept my request, invite all sectors of society, such as the banking, finance, vegetable, and news industries, to order foreign rice at the lowest price and the smallest commission, and store 200,000 bags for public sale, then no one will be able to manipulate, hoard, or speculate for profit, except for a reasonable profit. Then the food supply issue, I dare say, can be resolved once and for all. I hope that all sectors of society will promote and support this. My written proposal to the Municipal Council should be issued tomorrow (i.e., today).

Rice and Grain Meeting

The Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Association and the Miscellaneous Grain and Oil Cake Industry Association, in view of the frequent rise in rice prices, which is not only related to the livelihood of ordinary people, but also will hinder social security, in addition to the Bean and Rice Industry Association having convened an emergency meeting the other day, announcing that the rice market would strictly prohibit illegal transactions, the general rice speculators are still superficially obedient but secretly resistant, and the effect is very small. The market price increase has not subsided. It is now learned that in order to discuss concrete measures to stabilize the entire rice market, the above-mentioned two industry associations have scheduled a joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees of the two industry associations at 3 p.m. today at No. 15 Edinburgh Road, 3rd floor. All members are requested to attend and discuss on time.

Emergency Price Limit

The Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Association continued to issue the first emergency announcement yesterday, saying: "For the emergency announcement, it has been found that rice prices have continued to rise recently without limit, which greatly affects the livelihood and security of the people, which is of great concern. In addition to announcing to the market on the 1st of this month to warn colleagues to abide by the market trading rules, in view of the increasingly serious situation, in order to make emergency arrangements, from the 4th of this month, all rice prices are absolutely not allowed to exceed the closing price on the morning of the 3rd of this month. It is hoped that all parties involved in buying and selling will strictly abide by this and not deliberately violate it, so as not to cause inconvenience. If there are any incidents of dark market price increases, the authorities will be notified and severely punished, and there will be no leniency. This is hereby announced." It has been found that the rice price limit has been raised again and again, and yesterday's closing price reached the highest peak in history. Although it is now limited not to exceed this, even according to this price limit, most merchants and people in Shanghai will find it difficult to bear. If there are any more rumors, troubles, or forced price increases, then the future will be fraught with danger. Fortunately, the authorities attach importance to this.

### Relief Association Sends Letters to Various Industries; Begging to Continue Relief Donations for Another Year; The Cost of Sustenance Has Increased Fivefold Compared to Before; Maintaining the Original Donations to Implement the Original Intention of Disaster Relief

The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association sent letters to various industries yesterday, requesting that the original donations of various kinds be continued for another year, in order to implement the original intention of disaster relief. The original letter said: "Since the Association has been handling refugee relief, we have been blessed by the enthusiastic donations from various industries, either by recognizing salary deductions, or by recognizing business deductions, and regular assistance, so that tens of thousands of disaster victims have been able to avoid hunger and cold. We admire your great virtues and are grateful beyond measure. However, since the outbreak of the European War, the sustenance of our refugees has increased several times, the source of donations is limited, and the skyrocketing prices are endless. The difficulty of coping with this is beyond what paper and ink can describe."

Although the Number of People Has Decreased, Sustenance Has Increased Instead

"Although the number of refugees has now decreased to more than 16,000, the cost of sustenance for each person per month is more than ten yuan, which is five times more than the previous two yuan per person per month. It is still not enough to maintain this without large donations. Now, the national crisis has not ended, and the great calamity is still deep. If all the refugees are dismissed, not only will the original purpose of relief be lost, but these more than 10,000 refugees are all weak and disabled, and there is smoke everywhere, so where can they go? Since recently, the Association has been actively soliciting donations from all parties in order to continue relief. This is truly the trend of the times, and we cannot bear to abandon the work of nine仞 at the last minute. Your Association has embraced a broad vision and has always been generous. At this critical time, we sincerely beg you to continue the original refugee donations for another year, so that it may be completed from beginning to end. We will be grateful beyond words."

Those Receiving Winter Clothes Must Register First

This year's winter relief has attracted the attention of people from all walks of life. Various charities are also preparing early, such as the shelter that is being built. Once it is opened for accommodation, all those who are displaced and have nowhere to go will be allowed to register and receive cotton clothes. In order to avoid repeated collection of cotton clothes this year, the distribution will be centralized and registration will be carried out first. A "heart" symbol will be stamped on the arms, men on the left and women on the right. This symbol will take one or two months to fade completely, but it is usually covered by the sleeves and cannot be seen by others. However, the distributors can use this symbol to verify whether they have been collected or not.

Rectifying Porridge Relief and Distributing it Widely

Since the Chinese Jisheng Society started to use porridge tickets to distribute porridge to the poor, it has been very effective. The beggars are also happy to get this porridge ticket. However, it was recently discovered that the Dagou Bridge Teahouse and Porridge Shop was buying 30 porridge tickets from beggars. After learning of this, the Jisheng Society specially summoned all the porridge shops to admonish them and removed the porridge shop that bought the tickets from the list (i.e., it will no longer be printed on the porridge tickets in the future). Furthermore, each porridge shop was asked to find a guarantor to guarantee that there would be no incident of buying and selling porridge tickets. It is heard that more than half of the 30 porridge shops have submitted their guarantees to the Jisheng Society. After this rectification, the number of porridge shops has been expanded, and the porridge relief has become more widespread and more effective. In addition, there are others who have stepped forward to handle the matter, such as the Buddhist Brotherhood, and the Nuonajingshe, which is also planning a large number of porridge tickets, in order to benefit the poor.

A Charity Sewing Event Will Be Held Today to Sew Winter Clothes

The Shanghai YMCA has been collecting winter clothes for orphans. Recently, it has received hundreds of sets of new and old clothes from charitable people from all walks of life, and has raised more than 6,000 yuan in cash to purchase cloth, cotton, and lining. It is scheduled to hold a voluntary sewing event starting at 3 p.m. today in the Xue Geng Tang on the second floor of the YMCA at Ba Xian Qiao. At that time, China Underwear Company will donate technicians to go to the event and cut the fabric with sewing machines, and Shengjia Company will donate sewing machines. Many socialites are participating enthusiastically. The YMCA's work is divided into four parts: (1) sewing machine, (2) quilting, (3) hand stitching, and (4) attaching straps, in order to quickly make the clothes. In addition, for the sake of convenience, ladies from all walks of life are also invited to sew on a voluntary basis. There are also three methods: (1) come to the association to sew, (2) take the sewing home, and (3) pay for sewing, with a wage of five cents per piece. It is heard that the cost of each piece of labor is three yuan in national currency. At present, the donations can only make more than 2,000 pieces of winter clothing, which is limited. Winter is approaching in an instant, and it is feared that it will be difficult to distribute them. The Association has now continued to solicit donations widely from enthusiastic people from all walks of life and members of the Association. It is deeply hoped that everyone will do their best to donate money and effort in large quantities to benefit the disaster victims.

### Southeast United Transportation

It is heard that each office will also set up a repair factory and warehouse to provide services.

### Four Workers from the French Concession Tram Company Were Arrested Yesterday

The Driver Was Beaten

It is said that a tram of a certain number under the French Concession Tram Company was suddenly beaten by several workers from the company. The reason why the driver was beaten is said to be that the driver did not participate in the strike before the tram started during the general strike. The striking workers took him away, and he was only released after the strike was resolved. Before the driver was beaten, he was also ridiculed by some workers who took the opposite stance from him, which led to a fight due to the verbal dispute. Afterwards, the French police sent personnel to arrest the four workers who caused the trouble. Since the four workers were arrested, there was once a commotion among the workers, but it was quickly quelled, which led outsiders to believe that there was a possibility of another labor unrest. However, as of now, no incident has occurred. However, the labor side is scheduled to send representatives to visit Mr. Fevrier, the supervisor, yesterday afternoon, requesting that the arrested workers be released.

### After the Bombing of a Car on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway, the Bodies Were Scattered

After the train on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway was detonated by a landmine near Suzhou, the Japanese immediately searched extensively in the vicinity, cut off traffic, and prohibited pedestrians from entering and exiting. According to a visitor from Suzhou yesterday, the bombed train is now overturned on the side of the road and has not been removed. The bodies of the victims are still scattered all over the ground. All the bodies of the Japanese people were collected in coffins by the "China Railway Joint Stock Company" and the Suzhou General Affairs Agency on the first day and sent to Suzhou. In addition, there were more than 120 injured passengers. Those who were lightly injured were bandaged and discharged from the hospital. More than 50 people are still staying at the Suzhou Hospital in the city of Suzhou.

### Chinese Seamen in the United Kingdom Strengthen Solidarity

Liaison with the Transport Workers' Federation; Increase Wages and Marine Insurance Rates

Since the outbreak of the European War, many Chinese seamen and ship workers who have served on ships of various countries such as the United Kingdom, Germany, and France have been unemployed due to the war and have returned to China by ship. Recently, five Chinese seamen and ship workers who previously served on British mail ships transferred to the United States and took the American freighter S.S. Snusaa back to China and arrived in Shanghai. They were originally serving on the British ship "Glenlyon" as sailors and servants. After the war, the ship was forced to stop sailing and they were unemployed, so they took a ship back to China. It is also learned that in order to strengthen solidarity, Chinese seamen and ship workers in the United Kingdom have now organized a Chinese Seamen's Union, which is in contact with the International Transport Workers' Federation to increase Chinese workers' wages and marine insurance. Mr. W. J. Chen, the head of the union, has now negotiated with ship owners in the Allied countries. In the future, the lives of Chinese seamen and ship workers serving on merchant ships in various European countries will be guaranteed.

### Rescue Fire Brigade Chinese Staff Petition for Improved Treatment

Continue Serving Awaiting Resolution

Mr. Lutter, considering the high cost of living in Shanghai, expressed sympathy and promised to submit it to the Board of Directors meeting of the Public Works Department to resolve everything. However, he repeatedly urged his subordinates to continue working as usual and await a satisfactory reply from the authorities. Therefore, all seven hundred employees are currently serving as usual.

### Demise of Modern Buddhist Master, Yin Guang

Profound Knowledge of Buddhism, Universally Respected

Master Yin Guang was a great master in modern Chinese Buddhism. In his early years, he lived in the Sutra Depository for several years, reading all the Tripitaka scriptures, so his knowledge of Buddhism was profound and he was revered by his generation. He devoted himself to the Pure Land sect and his determination became even firmer. He also used this to persuade others. He wrote "Yin Guang Master's Essays" and the "Jia Yan Manuscript", which are respected by Buddhist practitioners and also recited by scholars. In his later years, he retired to Lingyan Temple in Suzhou. All Buddhist figures would seek his correction on their writings. He was already eighty years old this year. According to legend, he fell down the day before yesterday, after which Master Yin Guang bathed and changed his clothes, chanted the Buddha's name, and after several hours, passed away peacefully at the hour of mao (5-7 AM) on December 2nd. Some say that Master Yin Guang's scholarship and conduct were second only to Master Lianchi in the Ming Dynasty.

### Japanese Warship Shells Chuanshan

According to a report from the Datong News Agency, a Japanese warship sailing from the northeast shelled the coast of Chuanshan near Zhenhai more than ten times. It left at 2:25 PM. Afterwards, a warship sailed in and had not left as of last night. Two Japanese warships are also docked in the waters off Zhenhai Ligang, but there have been no unusual movements. The Japanese troops who landed in Ligang have not yet withdrawn. According to news from the shipping industry, on the 26th of last month, a Japanese warship off the coast of Shipu lowered a motorboat and chased sailboats. Afterwards, it sailed into Shipu Port and attempted to land. When the garrison stationed there fired, the Japanese boat, unable to withstand it, fled. Shortly afterwards, it suddenly fired four shots towards the coast, the shells falling into the mud, causing no damage. One Japanese warship is still docked in the waters off Shipu, with no unusual movements.

### Construction Begins on Beggar Asylum Buildings, Total Capacity of 2,400 People, Expenses Rely Entirely on Charitable Donations from All Sectors

The beggar asylum initiated and established by the Public Works Department of the Public Concession has begun construction. When the reporter visited Hart Road (now Changde Road) and Singapore Road (now Yanan East Road) yesterday, he saw that three of the twenty-four asylum buildings planned to be built there had already been erected with scaffolding. According to the Salvation Army's plan, each room will have ten beds, divided into two rows, with five beds in each row. Each bed can accommodate ten beggars, for a total capacity of 2,400 people. The asylum's rooms will have ample air and light, and each room will be equipped with ten glass windows.

All Buildings to be Completed Within the Year

The Public Works Department has been considering the establishment of a beggar asylum since last year, and it was not until the taxpayers' meeting held at the racecourse that it was publicly announced. This plan has now begun to be implemented this winter. However, the construction project may not be completed within the year. However, it is generally hoped that some of the buildings will be completed around Christmas, allowing beggars to live inside.

Education and Nurturing Combined to Enable Self-Reliance

According to the Public Works Department's announcement last time, it pointed out that the Bureau's established policy is that ordinary municipal tax revenues cannot be used for the purpose of relieving beggars. Therefore, the funding for the beggar asylum must rely on private charitable donations, and a portion will be taken from the entertainment donations from refugees within the concession. According to the current plan, all street beggars in the Public Concession will be sent to the asylum, provided with food, clothing, and shelter, and given appropriate education by the asylum staff. It is said that the ultimate goal of the entire plan is to enable beggars to have the ability to be economically self-reliant. Therefore, this plan is not a permanent solution to relieve beggars, but to gradually reduce the number of beggars in the Public Concession.

### Hartung-Chu Chieh-jen Land Rent Lawsuit, Dispute Over Black Market Exchange Rate, Difference Reaches About 400,000 National Currency, Supreme Court Should Have a Fair Judgment

More than 60 commercial and residential buildings, including Yile Mansion and Tongyuchun along Nanjing Road, are all owned by Chu Chieh-jen of Wuxian County (29 years old this year, residing at 73 Lane 6, Mei Paike Road), but are built on leased land. The land originally belonged to Mr. Scher Bilby of the Fair Bank. In March of the fifth year of the Republic of China, Chu's late father leased it from the Fair Bank, signing a 25-year long-term lease contract. The rent was paid in four installments per year, namely January 1st, April 1st, July 1st, and October 1st. Each installment (three months per installment) was 1,100 British pounds. The contract also stated that the rent would be paid in Chinese currency converted according to the

London Foreign Exchange

rate on the date of payment. Upon the expiration of the lease, the buildings would belong to the landlord. After the lease was signed, both parties fulfilled it for many years without any disagreement. Until the fourteenth year of the Republic of China, the land was bought by Li Sui Hartung (i.e., the wife of the British Jewish Hartung, originally a Chinese woman. After marrying Hartung, she became a British citizen. She is 875 years old this year and is currently the owner of Hartung Garden and Hartung Foreign Firm at 221 Nanjing Road). Chu Chieh-jen then inherited his father's fulfillment of the lease. Initially, there was no dispute with Li Sui Hartung. Until the end of the 26th year of the Republic of China, Chu believed that the rent he paid was within 17,000 National Currency per installment, although he lost one or two hundred yuan compared to the

Central Bank

listing rate of one shilling and two and a half pence per pound, he thought it was the agent's commission and had no objection. However, in the 27th year of the Republic of China, the bills from Li Sui Hartung for the first, second, and third installments increased. The first installment was 18,526.32 yuan, the second installment was 19,555.56 yuan, and the third installment was 29,746.42 yuan. Chu believed that Li Sui Hartung was using the black market exchange rate to implement a disguised rent increase, so he strongly opposed it. Therefore, Li Sui Hartung filed a lawsuit in the civil court of the First Special District Court that year, requesting the court to order the defendant Chu Chieh-jen to pay

three installments of rent

3,300 pounds according to the exchange rate listed by HSBC Bank. However, the original lease contract only stated that it would be converted into Chinese currency according to the London foreign exchange rate on the date of payment, and there was no provision to use the HSBC Bank exchange rate as the standard. Therefore, he requested that the plaintiff's lawsuit be dismissed. The first instance of the case ruled against Chu Chieh-jen. The appeal to the High Second Branch also resulted in a loss. Chu refused to accept it and appealed to the Shanghai Special District Branch of the Supreme Court. After review by the Supreme Branch, it was deemed that the original judgment was inappropriate and was sent back for retrial. The points of instruction stated that although the original judgment believed that there was only the HSBC exchange rate at the time of the signing of the contract, so the foreign exchange rate mentioned in the contract referred to the

HSBC Exchange Rate

and that whether HSBC would continue to exist in the long term of the contract and whether its listed foreign exchange rate would be suspended were all unnecessary to worry about. If so, then why did the parties not clearly specify the HSBC exchange rate as the standard? Since it was a long-term lease, then the common sense question of whether HSBC Bank would continue to exist for a long time and whether its foreign exchange rate would be suspended must have been considered. The original judgment said that such concerns were unnecessary. On what basis did it obtain this conviction? (2) Even if the parties had always converted according to the HSBC exchange rate, but the HSBC exchange rate is vastly different now, it should also be investigated whether there was an agreement between the parties to always follow the HSBC exchange rate regardless of the difference. Regarding the

Exchange Rate Issue

the Ministry of Finance's telegram should also be noted. The High Second Branch's retrial of the case, according to the order, still ruled against Chu Chieh-jen. The reason was that converting into Chinese currency according to the London foreign exchange rate meant using the market price of buying British pounds in Chinese currency. The exchange rate listed by HSBC Bank was the market price. Chu still refused to accept the judgment and hired lawyers Liu Chongyou, Li Wenjie, He Shimai, Wang Jian'e, and Zhou Kun to file an appeal with the Supreme Branch. The reasons stated that the bills given to the appellant by the appellee, Li Sui Hartung, only stated that it was converted into

Chinese Currency

according to several shillings and pence, and there was no mention of the HSBC exchange rate. Now they suddenly distort the meaning of the lease and actually use the black market as the legal price. The lease does not contain the words "market price" or "HSBC". The retrial court did not investigate further and actually approved the appellee's request, which is absolutely unacceptable. According to the Ministry of Finance's Yu Xian Hui Zi No. 1548, the exchange rate listed by the Central Bank should be used as the standard. According to the Ministry of Judicial Administration's order Xun Zi No. 2357, if the parties' contract states that payment is to be made in legal tender converted into foreign currency, the exchange rate stipulated by the national bank shall prevail. Then the appellant's

request based on the lease

is to use the Central Bank's exchange rate to convert the London foreign exchange rate, which is in accordance with laws and regulations. Furthermore, the meaning of foreign exchange rate is the exchange rate between two countries' currencies, that is, the scale of exchanging British pounds for Chinese currency is used for conversion. This is completely different from the so-called market price of buying British pounds in Chinese currency. If this is the meaning, then why didn't it state payment in British pounds and instead stated the foreign exchange rate? It is obvious that the retrial court's judgment was illegal. Since Chu Chieh-jen's appeal, he has supplemented the appeal six times. The Supreme Branch is still carefully studying the case because it is related to

National Legal Rights

and economic status. Regarding the two installments of rent for October 27th and January 28th, Li Sui Hartung had already filed the same lawsuit with the First Special District Court in January of last year. The result was that both the first and second instances were also won. Chu Chieh-jen also appealed to the Supreme Branch. Recently, Li Sui Hartung again filed a lawsuit against Chu for payment of six installments of rent from April 1st of the 28th year of the Republic of China to July 1st of this year, totaling 6,600 British pounds. The case has been studied several times by Li Hu, the Chief Justice of the Civil Court of the First Special District Court. On the 27th of last month, a judgment was announced. Chu Chieh-jen should pay Li Sui Hartung 6,600 pounds of rent according to the HSBC Bank exchange rate on a periodic basis. Chu

refused to accept the judgment

and has now hired lawyer Wang Jian'e to file an appeal with the High Second Branch. The above three cases are actually one case. The lawsuit has been going on for years and has not been resolved. The victory or defeat of both parties depends on the decision of the Supreme Branch. In this rent lawsuit, the difference between the Central Bank's exchange rate and the HSBC Bank exchange rate is very large. According to the Central Bank's exchange rate, each installment of rent is more than 17,000 yuan. If calculated according to the HSBC Bank exchange rate, the latest installment (i.e., October 1st) of rent has reached 76,800 yuan in national currency. The difference over two years amounts to 400,000 yuan in national currency. The case concerns Chinese-foreign debt and is of great importance. The Supreme Branch should have a fair judgment.

### Fabric Consignment, Devoured in Full, Resulting in the Recovery of Both Person and Goods

Wang Fangshan, a fabric merchant residing at 24 Lane 147, Xinzha Road, entrusted Li Guangyu, a boatman from Jiangbei, to transport 95 packages of white fabric worth 7,000 yuan to Changzhou on the 12th of last month. However, after more than ten days, there was no news. Wang rushed to Changzhou to inquire and learned that the goods had not arrived, knowing that Li had devoured them. He secretly investigated and arrested Li at a restaurant at 485 Yu Qiaqing Road yesterday. Li confessed that the fabric was hidden in room 56 of the Hongxiang Hotel on Avenue Edward VII (now Changshu Road). He reported this to the Xinzha Police Station, which sent detective Chen Baozhong to assist in the raid on Hongxiang. 59 pieces of white fabric were seized. Later, 36 pieces of white fabric were seized on a ship at the Suzhou Road Wharf. All were taken to the police station and escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court yesterday morning. Police lawyer Li Zhishan presented the case. Li Guangyu, who was questioned, hired lawyers Fan Ganglun and En Liang to defend him. Judge Liu ordered Li to be detained pending further interrogation in seven days.

### Unemployed Tourist Guide Staff Scams Tourist Guides Out of Clothes

Case Occurs and is Sentenced to Eight Months Imprisonment

Shen Jinsheng, a young man from Suzhou, used to be a staff member at a tourist guide agency, so he was quite familiar with the situation of the tourist guides. Recently, affected by unemployment, he had a whimsical idea. He opened a room in a hotel and recruited tourist guides to come, and then designed to trick them out of their clothes and pawn them for money. His methods were similar to a gigolo. No less than a dozen people were deceived by him. The value of the clothes deceived was more than 1,000 yuan. He was only recently discovered by Huang Cifu, a Chinese detective from the Laozha Police Station, who arrested Shen and retrieved six original stolen coats from various pawnshops. He was escorted to the Fourth Criminal Court of the First Special Court yesterday morning. The police lawyer filed a public prosecution for fraud and theft. Shen confessed that he committed this illegal act because he was forced by hunger. Judge Meng verified the facts and sentenced Shen Jinsheng to eight months in prison on the spot. The original stolen goods were returned.

Spring and Autumn

### On YuYuan Road

By Gao Yang

Coincidentally, it's the end of the month today, and I have to go to YuYuan Road early in the morning.

Recalling a restaurant on Dingpan Road that was celebrating a happy event, two bright red characters, "乌" (Wu - surname) , were on the red lanterns at the entrance. The guests eating and drinking at the entrance were whispering to each other, saying—

"This place is getting a 'little one' today, and it's the 'third one'. I heard that the woman is 'from the Qunyu brothel'..."

"Ah, Mr. Wu is lucky today, celebrating his wedding on such an 'auspicious day'. It's truly 'accumulated from his previous life'!" An old woman with a Jiangbei accent was murmuring in her mouth, chiming in.

Trams and cars arriving at Zhaofeng Park all have to 'anchor' and wait there. The 'workers' there then 'order' them to stop. Then, holding palm brushes and thin paste, they stick four 'flags' and five or six strips of colorful 'slogans' on both sides of the car. Each car has to be bothered by their flurry for four or five minutes, after which they knock twice on the side, as a secret signal that 'the car can drive away'.

"Hey, little dog, we earned eighty cents this morning!"

"My mom is sick and waiting for money!"

It was two young children who 'paste up the advertisements' talking. Two or three others were silent, waiting for the arriving cars.

Looking at the arriving cars, almost all of them are pasted up. Some are already torn when they come back, so they go to patch them up again. But more and more are torn off, so they give up. They look for the paste bucket and head north towards Avenue Petain. I watched the backs of four or five ragged figures disappear into an alley, and faintly heard 'Police, stop early'.

Getting back on the car, there was a sign on the glass window that read: "Mini-fundraising campaign for winter clothes for orphaned children in the city". I felt a bit emotional, but the posted advertisements on the outside of the car were not visible.

A gust of northwest wind drilled in through the open car window, tightening the clothes of everyone on the ride, but I shivered.

The car rolled out of the 'outlying' area again. As soon as I got off the car at Jing'an Temple, the air pressure on my face suddenly relaxed. I deeply breathed in a mouthful of turbid cool air into my nostrils!

Next to the Lao Da Fang train station, black, swarthy crowds were moving. Originally this place was crowded in Japanese times, but today it seemed to carry the look of a disturbance.

The people standing next to the station were talking—

"If the police go on strike, we will also close shop..." "As long as everyone looks at the Lao Da Fang, the stores here will follow suit and 'close down'!"

It looks like the situation today is probably not stable. It seems like something is going to happen around YuYuan Road this afternoon, people were worried!

"Shanghai won't have a sudden change, will it?!" I thought to myself.

Walking past the police post, running into the second barbed wire 'blockade line', everyone seemed to be rescued from the abyss, and came to the 'clean land' where they could see the daylight. 'People like us who "rely on" others should also wake up. Isn't the "outlying area" a model?'

Looking back, I saw someone at the station tearing off the 'advertisements' on the side of the car again. Maybe some poor children's families have no firewood to burn, tearing them back to 'fuel' the fire, I didn't know how to respond.

Hawthorne Case Files

### The Homecoming of the Dance Queen

— By Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter Twelve: Report and Explanation

"He dipped in the mud and walked into the house, stopping at the edge of the carpet in the parlor. Then he walked back out and went from the east side to the front door. His intention was to let people know that someone had come in from outside and then went out again. Therefore, he went in from the west and out from the east. The two rows were clearly distinguished, and no footprints overlapped in a messy way. It's a pity that it's too clear, leaving loopholes instead!"

"When he went in and out, he must have held his own satin shoes in his hand. When he reached the door, he changed into his own satin cloth-soled shoes, and then he picked up the leather shoes and went straight upstairs. At that time, his movements must have been very careful, and the people in the house were all asleep, and Zhao Boyou had not returned yet, so his plan could be completed safely. When he returned upstairs, he wiped the leather shoes with his white towel and returned them to the closet. Then he went upstairs to wipe the murder weapon clean. He wrapped it with the white towel and hid all the stolen jewelry somewhere. Then he went to bed and pretended to be asleep until the sound of the gun went off. Jinmei went to knock on his door, and he pretended to wake up. Naturally, no one suspected him."

Ni Jinshou suddenly said, "If we had gone upstairs to search this morning, wouldn't this secret have been revealed immediately?"

Hawthorne nodded and said, "Yes, that was our mistake. Actually, the problem lies in the second murder. At that time, we all felt that the handgun problem was more urgent and noticeable, so I first focused on the external issues and temporarily put aside the internal issues." Hawthorne's explanation was all clear at this point. I also believe that although it was based on speculation, it must not be far from the truth. Before leaving the police station, Hawthorne called Yu Gantang out again and gave him a lecture before letting him go. I also participated in a few words during the lecture. (185)

### A Must-Read for Parents

— Zhijian

We usually say: "If you raise but don't teach, it's the father's fault; if you teach but aren't strict, it's the teacher's laziness." It seems that the responsibility of "teaching" rests entirely on the teachers. Parents who only entrust their children to teachers have no "fault." In fact, it is not the case. In addition to "raising," parents also have the responsibility of "teaching." Wise parents are often their children's best teachers. Mencius's mother moved three times for the sake of her son's future; if Edison had not had his mother's encouragement and guidance, he would probably have been considered a "bad egg" in the end.

If you are a parent, how do you discipline your children? Strict beatings and scoldings? Excessive indulgence that is like spraying water? Or do you not care about anything and let your children do whatever they want?

Furthermore, before disciplining your children, have you understood everything about them? Their temperament, their aspirations, and so on.

(1) Do you know your children's temperament?

(2) Do you know your children's aspirations?

(3) Do you know your children's attitude towards you?

(4) Do your children have a sense of responsibility?

(5) Do your children have a sense of public morality?

(6) Do your children have the ability to self-govern?

(7) Do you know your children's strengths?

(8) Do you know your children's difficulties?

(9) Do you know what books and newspapers your children like?

(10) Do you know how your children spend money?

(11) Do your children have their own thoughts?

(12) Do your children have a skill?

(13) Do your children care about world events?

(14) Are your children's grades excellent?

(15) Do you know the state of your children's health?

(16) Do you know the reasons for your children's physical weakness?

(17) Do you know about your children's life during puberty?

(18) Do you know your children's height and weight?

(19) Do your children like fitness exercises?

(20) Do you and your children have organizational skills?

(21) Do you know about your children's vacation life?

(22) Do you know what groups your children participate in?

(23) Do you know your children's favorite entertainment?

(24) Do you know who your children's friends are?

(25) Do your children have the opportunity to talk to you every day?

### The "Kitchen" is Too Close

— Mang Bei

Gentlemen and ladies wearing fine leather are often "annoyed" to see a beggar using the Shen Bao newspaper as clothing. Men and women who come out of a bar often "hate" to see a 'bum' using a cigarette tin and a tree branch to stir watery porridge.

The reason is very simple. It is the principle of: "…hearing their cries, one cannot bear to eat their flesh, therefore the gentleman keeps his distance from the kitchen!" But it is not entirely like this.

In ancient times, gentlemen "could not bear" it, so they had to "keep their distance from the kitchen" before they would "eat their flesh." Although it seems to be fighting "foolishness," the heart is actually extremely "soft." Otherwise, why not "eat stewed meat in the slaughterhouse!"

But people nowadays are different after all. "Cannot bear" is certainly out of the question, but "annoyance" and "hatred" do exist. However, one cannot "blame them too harshly"...

Because, if we consider the reasons for their "annoyance" and "hatred," it must be because they themselves are wearing too warm and eating too full, while in front of them is that "sour look," and they feel a little "ashamed" (or rather, "embarrassed"), and...resulting in "under a fit of anger" (this is "turning shame into anger"), they develop feelings of "annoyance" and hatred.

So, in the final analysis, this is because the "kitchen" is too close. If it were a battle far away in Xu Yuan, it might not be like this. Otherwise, even with cotton stuffed in their ears, they could still "eat their flesh" with gusto!

### Apprenticeship in Film Art

— Shunyi

A Talk with Annan Overseas Student Yang Hua

Yang Hua has the characteristics of any young man from the South: extremely bold, adventurous, enthusiastic, and living a very active life. He reads "various" books: literature, opera, movies, Chinese and English novels, etc. One day, I had a very interesting conversation with him. He said: "I grew up in 'Annan.' My mother and sisters still live there. I originally wanted to go back first and then run to 'Yunnan' to study at 'Southwest Associated University.' If I couldn't get in, if the border was closed, I would stay in 'Annan'." He spoke enthusiastically and unrestrainedly about his wishes: "Please send me books, magazines, and newspapers regularly. I can tell the overseas Chinese in any part of 'Annan' what I know. I will also write newsletters to you about the situation of the overseas Chinese and the customs, political situation, etc. of Annan. Also, my sister studied in 'Annan' and is completely an 'Annan' person. She can tell me about 'Annan's literary classics' and I can translate them into Chinese——" But since I entered the 'Guolian' [likely a specific organization, not the League of Nations] to receive training, I no longer study at 'University.' I will go to act and make movies. Regarding movies, I know that he has been on camera many times. He doesn't like 'period costumes.' A reporter friend told me that 'Bu Wancang' [a famous director] admires him very much.——Because of this, one evening, while wandering on Avenue Joffre [now Middle Huaihai Road], I curiously asked him: 'I really don't understand. Now, big stars always take pride in being college students, as if telling people "I'm not just making movies and being a young actor, I'm a college student, I'm going to do this and that in the future." Why would a college student like you give up university and specialize in making movies as an apprentice?'"

"It's very simple," he smiled seriously, "I want to be an apprentice to a film artist." After a pause: "Studying at university is a kind of life, making movies is also a kind of life, but I feel that the latter is more suitable for me."

He is an apprentice to a film artist. When he studied at Fudan University, his name was 'He Xiqin.' 'Yang Hua' is his 'stage name' after joining the film troupe. He is only twenty-two years old and has a beautiful future. I can't help but bless him.

### The Wanderings of Mr. Wang

— Luo Cun

The pretty boy "Wang Laowu" [Mr. Wang, Fifth Oldest], meets the "femme fatale," "La Dame aux Camélias" [Camille], abandons the "joy of family," and takes flight in a "Night Flight," escaping to "Fuchun River" and associating with "King Xiang Yu" and "Huang Tianba," calling himself "Three Musketeers," forcibly takes rich family's "woman" and "Street Angel" as "One Night Queen," and is then pursued by the "Wild River Heroine" "Qin Liangyu" to "Sixty Years Later Shanghai." Then, he has the troubles of "First Love" with the nickname "Night Pearl" "Li Sanniang," which soon leads to "Peach Blossom News," causing the mess of the "Broadcasting Station Massacre," and is then detained in the "New Hell." Fortunately, his "Sea Sky Lovers" "Meng Jiangnu" rescues him to "Flying Flower Village," where he spends his "Free World" days. Before long, he has a "Precious Pearl" "Little Heroine," "becoming a wealthy and glorious" family, and living his "Gold and Silver World" life. But good times don't last long. In the prosperity of "Burning of the Red Lotus Temple," his wife and daughter "Beggar's Daughter" have become wandering "lost lambs" at the "Crossroads." Later, with the help of the "Mine Riding Knight" "Little Doctor," he braves the "Storm" in the "Horror" to rush to the "Gilded City," residing in a "Seventh Heaven" apartment. On quiet nights, he hears the "Midnight Song" of "The Orphan's Mother's Story," and then wife and daughter reunite and mutually lament "Mr. Wang's Hardship Eating!" Later, with a flash of inspiration, "Mr. Wang is Good at Making Money," he takes out the "Pearl Shirt" and buys the alias "Red Flower Vase" "Pan Qiaoyun" as a "Money Tree," and performs the obscene drama "The Hell's Accusation of Beauty." "He Hired Madame Diao and Liu with Huge Sum," and "Empress Wu Zetian" participates in the performance of "Spring Colors of the Palace." Later, he is extorted by one called "Yellow Sea Pirate" for ten huge sums. Mr. Wang then plucks the "Pipa Record" in his heart. Before sunrise, he and his wife and daughter embark on the "New Human Path" to seek help from the old gentleman "Confucius," but on the way, they suddenly encounter the "Unparalleled Beauty" "Meng Lijun," and he falls into the web of love again. Then, he encounters the "Cloud Dress Fairy" "Wang Baojian," making it difficult for him to choose. Later, obeying his wife's command, he steps onto the "Mr. Wang Returns to the Countryside" "Road" to achieve his path of repentance.

### Early Opening of the Golden Capital Grand Theater

— Xing Xing

The Gift Money Will Be Moved to Shelters to Help Those in Need - The First Film Decided is "Romance of the Western Chamber"

The Golden Capital Grand Theater is managed by the Liu brothers and is currently under active construction. The location is at the intersection of Avenue Foch [now Yan'an West Road] and Rue du Tofu [a small side street]. It was originally scheduled to open on Christmas of this year, but the authorities of the Golden Capital, in order to open earlier, decided to open on the 20th of this month. That is, the official opening is on the 20th.

The opening of the Golden Capital, various circles in Shanghai inevitably have some ceremonial exchanges. It is said that the Golden Capital authorities, in view of the large number of refugees in Shanghai, and that severe winter has arrived, which is certainly a great threat, so the Liu brothers decided on a method, hoping that all circles will give cash instead of gifts, and then all of the gift money will be transferred to the refugee shelters held by the Federation of Charitable Organizations to benefit the poor refugees. This is a good deed in the entertainment industry. Finally, it must be reported that the first film for the opening of the Golden Capital is the singing film "Romance of the Western Chamber" starring Zhou Xuan and Bai Yun.

### Listening to the Qin at the Yuqin Society

— Master of the Zhenxia Pavilion

In the autumn of Gengchen [1940], the Yuqin Society held a qin gathering at the Zhongshi Club. It was a monthly gathering. A corner of a small building, the windows and doors opened in all directions. In the midst of the hustle and bustle, to find such a place slightly isolated from the city is truly a beautiful realm. I had just returned from Kezhou, and after being exposed to the dust and vulgarity, I listened again to the elegance of the songs, and had the feeling of Xiangshan's poem "As if listening to immortal music, my ears are temporarily clear." The gentlemen in the society, as if mourning the elegant art, all studied diligently, which was pleasing. But Wu Zijinglue was especially outstanding. His rhythm was fast and slow, hitting the mark. His fingering was both firm and gentle. Each plucking, each vibrato, did not leave a trace but fully conformed to the rules. The meaning of the music was profound, reaching beyond the mundane. Playing "Yangchun," the spirit of flourishing emerges from his fingertips, like a hundred flowers blooming, with myriad scenes. Playing "Xiaoxiang," the emotion of the moving clouds and water, the sound of the wind in the valley, as if one is experiencing it firsthand, drifting away with the desire to escape the world. Playing "Changmen," the strings concealed the tragic mood, weeping and complaining, expressing resentment without anger, sorrow without injury, fully grasping what is called "the gentle language of children, without losing the demeanor of an empress." Other pieces, such as the beauty of "Plum Blossom," the solemnity of "Pu'an," and the back-and-forth of "Remembering Old Friends," all expressed their meaning fully,暢其曲情 [Unsure of this phrase]. To say that he is unparalleled for a time is certainly not flattery. In this time of ancient music falling into silence, how could there be more people like Zijinglue, rising together to promote it, so that the people of the world know that the quintessence of the country is worthy of cherishing, and not treating it like worn-out shoes! Because the people in the society listen to the members playing the qin, there should be no need to write a record. But Zijinglue's attainment in qin studies is truly worthy of being a model, so I record my admiration. How could it be said to be praise?

### Talking about the Three Pillars of the Yifeng Society

— Du Zhong

Mr. Zhou Xinfang's return to the stage this autumn after recovering from his illness is much better than before, but his voice is even brighter, and his singing is round and full. Recently, listening to his "Black Man Accusing" and "Four Visits to Mother," singing in double rhyme, he is quite competent, not repeating his old tones, which is truly commendable. As for his acting, he is meticulous from beginning to end, without any slack. The "Asking the Woodcutter" in "Black Man Accusing," "Hitting the Stick Out of the Box," and the "Crying in the Hall" sections in "Visiting Mother" are delicate and well-done. The beauty of his postures is truly admirable. As for his disciple Gao Baishui, he remains the same. In the "Sitting in the Palace" section of "Visiting Mother," he just yells with his throat. There are a few places where he is indeed refreshing. But in the "Turning Head to Call the Little Barbarian" tune, because the previous tune was too high, it was almost impossible to turn higher here. Also, that day he sang the call "Virtuous Princess, my wife" as "Virtuous Princess, my son," causing a big laugh in the hall. Wang Xichun also laughed all over her face. Speaking of Wang Xichun, her return to the stage this time is much more improved than before. Before, everyone said that she didn't know how to act and relied entirely on her beautiful appearance. This time, her body and face can be seen, probably because she learned "expressions" from filming a few movies. Her voice is also strong, and she sings more lively than before. I hope she takes good care of herself.

### Twenty Kinds of Yue Opera

— Written by Dong Yun, Illustrated by Xiu Yan

(Seventeen) Killing Son for Revenge

The play "Killing Son for Revenge" is the most common. Not only does Yue Opera have it, but every kind of drama has it. The plot is about a lewd and wicked woman who is passionately in love with her lover, and hates her own son for being nosy and an eyesore. Killing him is not enough. She even chops his corpse into pieces by hand. Her ruthless hand is equal to that of the Zhou Qinji brothers.

Wang Shi in the "Killing Son for Revenge" play is "charming" on the first half of the stage and wins with "unruly" in the second half. In terms of dramatic personality, "Yue Opera" is more neat and unruly than "Non-Opera." It is easier to please the audience by performing this kind of play. (See picture)

(Eighteen) Three Views of the Imperial Sister

Just hearing the name of the play, it seems very "unpopular." In fact, it is "Double-Linked Pen." Ballads and Southern Opera both have this version.

Miss Liu Dingjin has rendered meritorious service in conquering the barbarians and is awarded the title of "Princess" (called "Imperial Sister" in Yue Opera, which is quite charming and unique). She burns incense at the Tianqi Temple. Three days in advance, the people are notified that stealing the appearance of the princess is prohibited, and violators will be beheaded!

Feng Jiajin is a poor painter who is willing to risk being considered improper, wanting to see how beautiful the princess is. On the day the princess burns incense, he disguises himself as a farmer named Zhang Xiaoer, hiding under the offering table in the Tianqi Temple, hoping to see the princess. Unexpectedly, he is discovered on the spot. Feng Jiajin falsely claims, "This lowly person has a mother who is about to die! I specially came to offer incense to make a wish, to wish the old woman will not need medicine." The princess is kind-hearted and releases him. After leaving the temple, Feng finds the princess's beauty delightful. One view is not enough. He enters the temple again, which is called "Second View."

The princess finds his words elegant and his appearance dignified. After returning to the palace, she even "a tiny heart, pines for the man." It goes so far that the imperial physician is at a loss. A notice is posted to seek treatment. Feng Jiajin takes down the notice and enters the palace, which is the third time he sees the princess.

Later, the lovers eventually become a couple.
