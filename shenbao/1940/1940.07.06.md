Editorial

### How to Relieve the People's Food Crisis

Commodity prices fluctuate wildly, and the lives of Shanghai residents are still in a serious state, without any respite. For example, the Shanghai workers' cost of living index for June continued to rise, reaching a record high of 422.91 percent. The reason for this is the natural result of soaring rice prices. The high rice prices in Shanghai today are not due to an imbalance of supply and demand, but to artificial manipulation. Those who dare to manipulate have their means, their reliance, and their collusion. Not to mention their financial resources, which should not be underestimated, but judging from their reckless and fearless behavior, their audacity is no accident. To discuss supply and demand while ignoring manipulation is pointless. Although there are still no reliable surveys and statistics on rice stocks in Shanghai to cite as evidence, the number of imported foreign rice reported daily in this newspaper is not small. Furthermore, according to inquiries from various sources, if the export of rice from Shanghai were prohibited, it would be sufficient to meet demand before the new grain is harvested, with some left over. There is no shortage of rice on the road, and the number of newly ordered rice is also large. Therefore, there is no fear of insufficient supply for the food needs of the people of Shanghai.

Statistics only show the outline of general life, not the inner suffering. Those who have not personally experienced it cannot easily know the hardships they face. I have often heard workers say that after working all day, they earn a wage of one yuan and forty or fifty cents, and buying two liters of rice costs them more than one yuan. The rice they buy not only has many broken grains, but is also mixed with rice bran without their knowledge. When cooked, it resembles a porridge that is slightly firm, and it is still not enough to feed the family. The children cry from hunger, and the parents' hearts break, yet all their blood and sweat are spent on this. In the past, Shanghai experienced several disturbances due to high grain prices, but recently, although rice prices are unprecedentedly high, there have been few reports of security problems caused by rice prices. This is not evidence that people can afford it, but also because they are mindful of the environment and understand that the situation of the concession authorities is not what it used to be, so they are willing to endure hunger and wait for the authorities to take action. Because of this, the authorities should be particularly aware of the people's suffering and relieve their distress: ensure that rice prices are not controlled and manipulated by unscrupulous merchants and restore them to normal; ensure that there is no parallel market outside the market and no black market outside the parallel market. This depends on effective market management and strict evaluation procedures. Although there is talk of establishing a rice evaluation committee, its effectiveness remains to be seen. If the evaluation committee is properly managed after its establishment, it can eliminate the black market and make market price fluctuations predictable. If it is not done properly, it will still become a refuge for rice merchants, and the situation will be reversed, making it impossible to stabilize rice prices. Therefore, whether the food situation is a blessing or a curse depends on whether the supervision and control are effective and not just empty words. What should be understood now is that price limits and evaluations each have their limits. Price limits are only effective in addressing immediate needs and cannot be sustained. As a result, a black market is bound to emerge, making it impossible to limit prices. The use of evaluation is to restore market prices to the public and eliminate the black market. Once the black market is gone, the market price will be unified. Once it is public, manipulation and price increases will be somewhat restrained, and speculative transactions such as "scalping" and "passing the buck" may be somewhat reduced. Then, rice prices can be expected to rise and fall with supply and demand. However, the benefit to the people's food situation is very limited. Its maximum effect is simply to allow the public to obtain a reasonable amount of rice at a normal price, but it is still far from achieving the goal of lowering rice prices and benefiting the citizens.

The most effective way to help the majority of poor people in an emergency is to carry out large-scale, sustainable grain sales at subsidized prices. In ancient times, subsidized sales involved opening granaries and distributing grain, which could add a large amount of grain to the market, and the subsidized price was not subject to excessive market price constraints, unlike today's subsidized sales, which still require purchasing from the market and reselling to the people. However, it should be noted that subsidized rice sales are exempt from taxes, which is lower than the cost of general rice. If the profit per unit is sought to be non-loss, then the rice will inevitably be subject to wastage, which needs to be compensated by donations from all sectors or public subsidies. Moreover, in carrying out disaster relief sales, convenience should be sought for the majority of buyers, so there should be many locations rather than few, and they should be scattered rather than concentrated. It is pitiful to see poor people stretching their necks and waiting under the scorching sun for this small benefit. Therefore, the unit of measure should be accurate and not eroded, and the quality of the rice should be genuine and not adulterated. All these benefits to the poor depend on the sincerity and strength of those who carry out the work!

If the rice price can return to normal, and subsidized sales can alleviate the suffering of the poor, then it seems that part of the difficulty of the food problem can be solved. But unless there is a gradual improvement plan for the entire food situation, there is no hope for the revival of the people's livelihood. The revival of the people's livelihood cannot be expected of the concession authorities, but punishing rice weevils is within the power and ability of the concession authorities.

### The United States Observes the European Situation and Carefully Considers its Policy Toward Japan; Japan is Concerned About Many Aspects of its Continental Policy; Britain Denies the Anglo-American Naval Alliance

New York: According to a United Press report from Washington, U.S. government leaders have remained silent on the statement by a Japanese naval spokesman that the United States must abandon its unreasonable obstruction of Japan's continental policy in the Far East in order to resolve concerns about U.S.-Japan relations. Informed sources interpret the U.S. position differently. The current U.S. government shows no tendency to comply with any conditions demanded by Japan. However, how long this position will be maintained in the new situation depends on various factors, the most important of which is Britain's ability to repel enemy aggression and maintain its own fleet. Britain's seizure of French warships has aroused more than fleeting interest in foreign official circles. As it stands now, Japan, like the United States, is sitting back and watching the progress in Europe, and does not intend to fully implement its new "Asian Monroe Doctrine." (5th Reuters dispatch)

Geneva: According to a London correspondent for the "Geneva Forum," British officials yesterday solemnly denied rumors spread by Japan that the U.S. Navy would soon be integrated into the British Navy for operations. They strongly asserted that the reason for Japan's creation of this rumor was clearly that Britain had strengthened its defenses in Hong Kong and Australia, and the United States had strengthened its defenses in the Philippines, to prevent Japanese Foreign Minister Arita from achieving his dream of dominating the Pacific. At the same time, U.S. Secretary of War Stimson suggested that Britain use U.S. Atlantic ports and the United States use British Pacific ports to mutually exercise police functions, which led to the aforementioned rumors. (5th Haitong dispatch)

Tokyo: The Asahi Shimbun recently published an editorial strongly stating that the current situation in the Pacific is extremely serious. It stated, "The current situation in Hong Kong and the U.S. fleet's return to the Hawaiian Islands are indeed related. At this time, it would not be surprising if the U.S. fleet were to proceed directly to the Philippine Islands. As for Britain, it is also doubtful whether it is deliberately exaggerating the crisis near Hong Kong in order to draw U.S. attention to the Far East. We dare to assert that there is currently no evidence to justify the Hong Kong authorities' declaration of a state of emergency. In short, the Japanese government is determined to pursue its diplomatic policy, and even if it leads to friction with the British and American governments, it will not hesitate to include the South Sea Islands in the 'New Order in East Asia.'"

Washington: U.S. congressmen yesterday considered authorizing President Roosevelt to implement a blockade against Japan this week. (5th United Press dispatch)

### Britain Unwilling to Concede in Negotiations on Blocking Burma; Sought Advice from the United States

London: The envoy here has been strenuously trying to persuade the British government to accept its demand to prohibit the transport of war materials from Burma into China. After talks between the Japanese ambassador to London, Mamoru Shigemitsu, and Foreign Secretary Butler, Japanese sources said that Shigemitsu pleaded with the British government to accept Japan's demands, as it was heard that Britain would submit a definite reply. It is claimed that the Japanese ambassador said that Britain's rejection of Japan's demands would hinder the Japanese government's intention to maintain friendly relations with Britain and the United States. The British government seems to be awaiting a response from Australia regarding a draft that Britain is preparing to send to Tokyo next week. It is believed that the British government is also seeking advice from the United States. There has been no change in the general impression here that Britain will reject Japan's attempt to manipulate Burma, which is three thousand miles from Tokyo. (5th United Press dispatch)

### Optimistic Signs of Chinese Resistance; Observations of Dr. Bunn

Pasadena: Dr. Bunn, who served as president of Nanjing Jinling University for 30 years, declared that the Japanese invasion of China swept away the inertia inherited by the Chinese people from 270 years of Manchu rule. He said, "China's years of slumber have entered a path of great new development." To date, due to the Japanese invasion of China, China has achieved the following four successes: (1) China has been politically unified, forming a strong central government from disunity. (2) Warlords have been stripped of power and all provinces have been united. (3) The western provinces, which have seen no progress for centuries, are now rapidly industrializing, with factories, highways, telephones, telegraphs, ships, post offices, and cities making rapid progress. (4) The Chinese people are optimistic and confident, because no well-equipped Chinese army has been captured or annihilated by the Japanese army. (5th United Press dispatch)

The Netherlands East Indies will supply Japan with coal, oil, tin, rubber, iron ore (i.e., bauxite), and chromium. However, the details of the agreement are still under discussion, with the quantity of goods exported from the Netherlands East Indies and the issues of Japanese trade and immigration in the Netherlands East Indies being the most important.

### US Navy Begins Plan to Build Eighty-Seven New Ships; Navy Shipyards Ordered to Accelerate Work

Washington: US naval circles announced today that the US Navy Department is currently planning to build eighty-seven new warships in the coming months. Sixty-eight of these eighty-seven new ships are specified in President Roosevelt's $1,277,741,000 national defense supplementary program. The other nineteen are listed in the 1941 naval budget. According to officials, these two shipbuilding programs will be rapidly contracted to existing private shipyards and naval shipyards. Naval shipyards have recently been ordered to implement accelerated work programs, increasing the regulated forty-hour work week to forty-eight hours, with increased wages corresponding to the increased work hours. The Navy Department now requires $144,400,000 to build 367,000 tons of warships, including three new aircraft carriers, thirteen cruisers, thirty destroyers, and twenty-two submarines. In addition, $78,400,000 is earmarked for the construction of cannons and other equipment. Of these 367,000 tons of new ships, Congress has approved but not yet allocated construction funds for 20,000 tons, with supplementary ships accounting for 167,000 tons. These 167,000 tons of supplementary warships, enough to increase the strength of the US fleet by eleven percent, are included in the Vinson Naval Act. This move by the Navy Department will enable the construction of 143 warships in the short term, with fifty-six already under construction. These fifty-six ships under construction include eight battleships, totaling 45,000 tons, six light cruisers, twenty-seven destroyers, fourteen submarines, and one aircraft carrier.

### The Yonai Cabinet Totters; Konoe's Faction Seizes the Opportunity to Revive

Tokyo: The position of the Yonai Cabinet has been unstable for some time. According to well-informed sources, the cabinet's demise may be a matter of days. In view of Germany's military victories, the Yonai Cabinet's policies over the past six months, in the eyes of Japanese political commentators, have only proven that the cabinet has completely failed to foresee the world situation and the creation of a "new order" in Europe. Its lifeless negotiations with the Wang Jingwei government in Nanjing have also been widely criticized. In addition, the recent surge in prices, shortages of goods, and increasing internal unrest have allowed the Konoe-led faction to seize the opportunity to revive with great momentum. The faction will represent the broad national interests, not just the warmongering political parties. Its goal is to overthrow the Yonai Cabinet. After Foreign Minister Arita delivered a broadcast speech on June 27, outlining the international situation and the position of the Japanese Empire, the situation became even more urgent. The speech was the result of pressure from the military, and abandoned the government's declaration regarding Japan's future foreign policy. Rumors suggest that both the army and navy now oppose the issuance of formal communiqués that would bind the government's hands at a time when the world situation is undergoing unexpected developments. After consulting with Army Minister Hata Shunroku, senior officials of the Ministry of the Army, and twenty-five army generals, Prime Minister Yonai met with them on July 1 to present the military's views and advocate for the implementation of a stronger policy, as outlined in Arita's broadcast, arguing that Japan should seize the current golden opportunity to lay a solid foundation for "East Asian autonomy." With Puyi's recent visit to Japan and the government busy with hospitality, immediate action was suspended. The new cabinet will likely be led by Konoe or organized by someone else, which has not yet been decided. However, judging from the atmosphere prevailing throughout Japan, it seems certain that a strong nationalistic policy will be implemented. According to the Asahi Shimbun, the Japanese government has fully decided to implement a foreign policy that includes the South Seas in the proposed new order of the Far East, regardless of the risk of friction with the British and American governments. Judging from the situation, Japan will first focus on French Indochina, where there is the possibility of an "automatic" independence movement. Dealing with Hong Kong is a second step. Although Britain's refusal to accept Japan's proposals to cease allowing goods destined for Chongqing to transit through Hong Kong and Burma, and to withdraw British troops stationed in Shanghai, is enough to create a critical situation in South China and Shanghai, Japan is unlikely to take any immediate military action. If there are any signs of German success in attacking Britain, then firmly consolidating the "Axis" is almost certain to be intended. (5th, Reuters dispatch)

### The Pétain Government Decides to Sever Diplomatic Relations with Britain; British Ships and Aircraft Approach the French Coastline, Local Troops Ordered to Fire Upon Them

Geneva: An official Vichy communiqué this morning stated that the Pétain government severed diplomatic relations with Britain today. Yesterday, the French cabinet, enraged by the British navy's illegal attack on the French fleet, decided to sever diplomatic relations with Britain. (5th, Haitong dispatch)

London: As of now, the British government has not received notification from the Pétain government of its intention to sever relations with Britain.

German reports state that General Pétain's request was delivered to Ambassador Bullitt by French Foreign Minister Baudouin, who also requested that the French attitude be conveyed to President Roosevelt. The French government hopes that President Roosevelt will ask Britain to cease its attacks on the French fleet, as such British actions are "a violation of international law."

France Under German Control, May Declare War on Britain

London: Diplomatic circles here believed last night that the British seizure of French ships anchored in British ports on July 3 may lead France to declare war on Britain. British political figures believe that France will not take this step, at least for the time being. However, well-informed sources report that the Pétain government is currently considering severing diplomatic relations with Britain. British authorities say they cannot confirm reports that the Pétain government has decided to sever relations with Britain. It is believed here that this move by Britain may place the French fleet under the command of Führer Hitler. Authorities believe that this trend is in line with the Pétain government's pro-Italian and increasingly fascist tendencies. (5th, United Press dispatch)

Geneva: The French Navy Department today issued a communiqué regarding the naval battle, stating in brief: A British fleet, including three capital ships such as the "Hood," one aircraft carrier, and many cruisers and destroyers, appeared near Mers-el-Kébir, where the French fleet was anchored, including two capital ships, the "Dunkerque" and the "Strasbourg," two cruisers, the "Provence" and the "Bretagne," three second-class cruisers, and many light warships and submarines. The British fleet commander presented an ultimatum to Vice Admiral Gensoul, stating that if the French fleet refused to join the British fleet, the British ships would destroy the French ships to prevent them from falling into the hands of Germany and Italy. Vice Admiral Gensoul replied that he would resist force with force, and that the entire French navy would fight against Britain after the British ships fired the first shot. After receiving the report, the French Navy Department also ordered resistance with force, and the French government approved the Navy Department's decision and notified the Armistice Commission of this fact. Germany and Italy did not demand the surrender of the French navy, but only demobilization, keeping the French ships in French ports, under the control of the Armistice Commission. British government leaders attempted to control the French fleet, and the only countermeasure for the French fleet was to scuttle them. The British fleet did not wait for the French fleet to respond within the prescribed time, but immediately laid magnetic mines in Mers-el-Kébir by aircraft, and opened fire on the French ships after the expiration of the ultimatum. According to reports received by the French Navy Department, the cruiser "Bretagne" has sunk, and the "Dunkerque," "Provence," and "Mogador" have also caught fire. (5th, Haitong dispatch)

British Naval Secretary Reports on Battle Situation: Battle of Mers-el-Kébir in Progress

London: Naval Secretary Alexander broadcast last night, speaking about the British handling of the French fleet, praising Admiral Somerville and his men, saying that the British fleet suffered only minor losses, with one officer and one soldier wounded, and one aircraft missing. From the glorious cooperation between the two navies at Dunkirk to the tragic action at Mers-el-Kébir, the path taken was a painful one. If one could continue to fight the common enemy to the final victory, nothing would bring greater joy. However, we have repeatedly advised and pleaded, and tried various solutions to avoid dangers that would hinder our principles, but to no avail. Now, hundreds of French officers and soldiers have voluntarily joined us, willing to continue fighting for the common cause. We welcome them and wish them success in their great work. (5th, Reuters dispatch)

London: According to Madrid Radio, the battle between the British and French fleets at Mers-el-Kébir is still in progress this morning. (5th, United Press dispatch)

Alexandria: No news has been released regarding the future of the French fleet in Alexandria. Today, the joint British and French fleet remains docked in this port, appearing as peaceful as usual. (5th, Reuters dispatch)

London: According to information currently being revealed, on June 19 (two days after the French surrender), several French naval vessels sailed into Plymouth, where they were warmly welcomed by thousands of people on the shore. Three tugboats were responsible for attending to the first French ship to arrive. After the ship reached the shore, it was discovered to be filled with departing sailors, far more than needed to operate the ship. It was then learned that these sailors were all from shore-based units located at the ship's base. Several French speedboats entered the harbor that evening, followed the next morning by submarines, destroyers, and smaller ships. Day after day, large numbers of French small ships continued to arrive, including armed fishing vessels, tugboats, and merchant ships. On July 3, two more destroyers arrived. It is now heard that there are still French ships hiding in Scottish territorial waters. (5th, Reuters dispatch)

Italian Navy Assists France in Combat, Willing but Unable

London: Rome Radio broadcast in response to British Prime Minister Churchill's statement that "the Italian Navy carefully avoids Mers-el-Kébir," saying that the Italian Navy observed the battle from afar because it could not reach the area in time. The radio station threatened naval retaliation and asked the British fleet to repeat its actions against the Italian naval base. (5th, Reuters dispatch)

Rome: The Italian government last night refused to confirm or deny reports that the Italian fleet was sailing at top speed towards Mers-el-Kébir to assist the French navy in fighting the British fleet. A government spokesman stated that any such information would be considered a "military secret." (5th, Reuters dispatch)

Rome: German newspapers have denounced Churchill as a villain, saying that Britain should be hanged opposite the Nelson statue in Trafalgar Square. Today, Italian newspapers have followed suit, expressing unrestrained anger at Britain's naval action at Mers-el-Kébir. All newspapers denounce this act as the greatest crime in history, and many call Churchill a "thug." (5th, Reuters dispatch)

British Actions Against French Fleet Affect US Naval Policy

Washington: Unofficial sources believe that Britain's takeover or sinking of the French fleet is an important factor in the United States' decision on whether to keep its fleet in the Pacific. If Britain's achievements are as reported by the British, then the US fleet will remain in Hawaii, or at least in the East for the time being, to observe whether Britain's naval power can withstand attacks by the German air force. There is no need for the US fleet to move to the Atlantic until the British fleet has completely failed and the British government is in real danger. (5th, United Press dispatch)

Britain Takes Decisive Measures, US and Turkey Express Sympathy

New York: Today's newspapers all prominently feature the British action against the French fleet. British Prime Minister Churchill's speech was met with sympathy. Americans especially admired Churchill's submission of this action to the United States for judgment. The United States was previously too busy dealing with its surroundings to care about other matters. Now that Britain has occupied the French fleet, the United States can reduce its worries. (5th, Reuters dispatch)

Washington: Members of Congress here yesterday unanimously approved of Britain's actions against the French fleet. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Pittman believed that Britain's actions restored people's faith in Britain's war efforts. Senator William King told the press that he believed Britain's actions were very proper. "Anything that strengthens Britain's power also strengthens our power. I hope that France will hand over its fleet to Britain. Britain's taking this extraordinary action is entirely justified. Anyone who fights for democracy must welcome Britain's actions. It must be known that gaining political and economic control of Latin America and the United States is also one of the goals of the totalitarian nations. If Britain can continue to resist and the British navy remains intact, then the totalitarian nations' goals will be difficult to achieve." Other members of Congress also unanimously approved of Britain's actions. (5th, United Press dispatch)

Ankara: After the news of the fate of the French fleet was released today, people here felt a mixture of comfort and satisfaction. In the past, people were deeply concerned about the lack of news about the whereabouts of the French fleet. Turkey approves of the measures taken by the British, as its historical motto is "action."

### The British Government's Determination to Fight: Peace Rumors Collapse of their own Accord. Reluctant but Stern Measures Against the French Fleet: Churchill's Tearful Speech in the House of Commons

London - Prime Minister Churchill stated in the House of Commons yesterday afternoon that the rumors and slanders that Britain intends to negotiate peace with the German and Italian governments should be dispelled by our necessary adoption of painful and severe actions. There will be no negotiation and no peace talks. We will do our best to wage war with all means at our disposal until the just peace we seek is achieved. (Cheers from the audience). The "painful and severe actions" referred to by the Prime Minister pertain to the Anglo-French naval battle at Mers-el-Kébir in Algeria on Wednesday, and the British taking control of French warships docked in British ports Portsmouth and Plymouth to prevent them from falling into German hands. After the commander of the French fleet at Mers-el-Kébir refused the British request to transfer the fleet to British control, the British fleet attacked the French fleet, sinking or destroying several of its ships. According to the Prime Minister's announcement, two French battleships, two cruisers, eight destroyers, several submarines, and two hundred small vessels, including minesweepers and anti-submarine vessels, docked in Portsmouth and Plymouth were taken over by British soldiers on Wednesday after the British issued a brief notice to the captains of each vessel. There was no resistance or bloodshed, except for one British officer and one French officer killed and several people injured on the giant submarine "Surcouf." Most of the French crew members gladly accepted this and hundreds expressed a strong desire to continue fighting against Germany. Several French submarines in the Mediterranean have automatically joined the British fleet, and French ships docked in the port of Alexandria have also received notification not to leave the port. A large part of the French fleet has been placed under British control, or sunk, or rendered inaccessible to Germany. Britain will also find ways to prevent other French warships from falling into German hands. The full text of Churchill's speech is as follows:

France Breaks a Solemn Promise

I have to announce to the House with heartfelt sorrow that we must take measures to prevent the French fleet from falling into enemy hands. When two countries are fighting side-by-side against a common enemy under a solemn alliance, one country may, due to exhaustion and coercion, have to ask its ally to waive its obligations. The least we can expect from the French government is that when it abandons the war and places its full weight on Britain, it should be careful not to inflict unnecessary harm on its loyal ally, which hinders the ultimate victory of Britain upon which French freedom depends. The House will recall that we offered to release the French from their treaty obligations, attaching one condition: that the French fleet should sail into British harbors before separate armistice negotiations were completed. France did not do this. Although French Fleet Commander Darlan made various personal promises and guarantees to the British, the armistice agreement was ultimately signed, placing the French fleet under German and Italian power, just as effectively as the other French ships that did not head to African ports ten days ago but sailed into Portsmouth and Plymouth and fell under British power. The Bordeaux government, knowing the consequences of this matter and its danger to us, refused Britain's appeal when abandoning the alliance and canceling the agreement. I must record how significant the harm they inflicted on Britain was. There is also something that can be described as heartless or malicious treatment, which did not come from the French people who had never heard of this matter, but from the Bordeaux government. What is this matter? More than four hundred captured German pilots imprisoned in France, mostly shot down by the British Air Force, were to be handed over to Britain by former French Prime Minister Reynaud for custody. But after Reynaud fell, they were returned to Germany. There is no doubt that the Bordeaux government did this to win Germany's favor (and disregarded the harm inflicted on us. When the German Air Force was in dire need of senior pilots, the Bordeaux government returned four hundred elite pilots, knowing that they would wreak havoc on Britain and require the British Air Force to shoot them down again. Isn't this even more hateful? I know that history will never forgive this absurd act. I believe that the French will eventually rise up to sweep away this stain and restore their national honor.

Resolute Action to Save Ourselves and Others

Last week, I said that we must now give special attention to our self-defense. In all my experience, I have never seen such a painful and sad issue discussed in the Cabinet as the one concerning the disposal of the French fleet. The reasons for the method we are duty-bound to carry out are so strong that all the members have the same confidence in what should be done, without hesitation or disagreement. The twelve members of the military cabinet, as well as the Minister of Information and the Minister of Colonial Affairs, who is most famous for his friendship with France, all felt that there was no other option but this. We unanimously made this decision with sadness and clear observation. Therefore, after various preparations were completed yesterday morning, a large part of the French fleet was placed under our control, or made to comply with our needs. Two French battleships and two light cruisers, several submarines, including the giant submarine "Surcouf," and about two hundred small but extremely useful minesweepers, mostly docked in Portsmouth, were taken over by British soldiers after the British sent a brief notice to the captains of each vessel. Except for a conflict on the large submarine "Surcouf" due to a misunderstanding, which resulted in the death of one British officer and two sailors, and one French officer, and one injury on each side, everything else proceeded smoothly without resistance or bloodshed. Most of the French sailors gladly accepted the end of this uncertain period, and 800 to 900 people expressed their strong desire to continue fighting against Germany and requested to become British citizens. We are prepared to especially please them, and we will not discriminate against other thousands of Frenchmen who wish to fight as Frenchmen. The rest will be sent back to France when the French government is able to welcome them back with the consent of the German rulers. The French soldiers in Britain will also be sent back, except for those who voluntarily serve under General de Gaulle to engage in national salvation work. Several French submarines have automatically joined the British fleet, and we have accepted their services. The port of Alexandria in the Mediterranean is home to a strong British fleet, and four French battleships and one cruiser, three new warships equipped with eight-inch guns, and several smaller ships are also docked nearby. They have now received notice not to leave the port without authorization, so as not to fall into the power of France's conquerors. Negotiations and discussions are of course underway, and there is no need to tell the House the details. Methods have been taken to ensure that the French fleet either sinks into the sea or complies with our wishes. This morning, when Italian aircraft attacked Alexandria, some French warships also opened fire on the common enemy. From this alone, we can imagine the pain that the British and French naval personnel felt in spirit regarding the disposal of the French fleet. We will provide convenience and supplies to the French soldiers in Alexandria who wish to continue fighting until the end of the war. We are also willing to send the rest back to France, and we will do our best to take care of them to ensure their safety when they leave Alexandria.

The most serious part of this matter still exists. The French Navy's best warships, the "Dunkerque" and "Strasbourg," are new battlecruisers superior to the German "Scharnhorst" and "Gneisenau." Now, along with two battleships, several light cruisers, and destroyers and submarines, they are docked in Mers-el-Kébir on the coast of Morocco in North Africa. Yesterday morning, the British selected Colonel Holland, the former naval attaché stationed in Paris, to go by destroyer to see the commander of the French fleet, but he was refused. Holland left a document.

Presenting an Ultimatum, Ultimately Rejected

I may as well read the contents of this document to the House. Its three paragraphs concern the armistice issue. The document then states, "We, your former comrades, cannot allow the warships under your command to fall into German and Italian power. We are determined to fight to the end. If we win, as we expect, we will not forget that France was originally our ally, and our interests are also France's interests, because our common enemy is Germany. We solemnly declare that if we win, we will restore France's greatness and territory. For this reason, we must prevent the best warships of the French Navy from being used by this common enemy to control us. In this environment, the British government instructs me to request that the French fleet stationed in Mers-el-Kébir take one of the following actions: (A) sail out with us to continue fighting against Germany and Italy to seek victory; (B) sail to a British port under our supervision, leaving only a few crew members, and the remaining crew members can be sent back to France as soon as possible. If either of the above two options is adopted, Britain is willing to return this warship to France at the end of the war. If it is damaged, Britain is willing to fully compensate; (C) if you believe that French warships should not attack Germany and Italy unless Germany and Italy violate the armistice agreement, then French warships can sail to French ports in the West Indies, such as Martinique, with only a few crew members, where French warships can be disarmed to our satisfaction, or entrusted to the United States for safekeeping, pending the outcome of the war, and the crew members can be sent back. If you refuse the above method, I have to ask you with deep regret to scuttle each ship within six hours, otherwise, I am instructed by the British government to use the force we deem necessary to prevent the French ships from falling into enemy hands." (Great cheers from the audience).

We had hoped that one of the methods we proposed could be accepted by the French side, and that there would be no need to use the terrible force of the British warship fleet. But it was not so, and the British fleet appeared before Mers-el-Kébir two hours after Colonel Holland's departure. The commander of this fleet was Vice Admiral Somerville, who had recently carried over 100,000 Frenchmen during the Dunkirk evacuation and had a distinguished record. In addition to battleships, he also had cruisers and destroyers at his command. After a day of deliberation, we still hoped before noon that our conditions could be accepted without bloodshed. However, the French commander undoubtedly obeyed the orders of the Wiesbaden Germans and refused to comply, saying that he was willing to fight. Therefore, the British government instructed Vice Admiral Somerville to complete his mission before nightfall. At 3:58 p.m., the British fleet opened fire and bombarded the powerful French fleet, which was also protected by shore batteries. At 6:00 p.m., the British commander reported that he was engaged in combat. The British aircraft carrier "Ark Royal" also provided fierce assistance. At 7:20 p.m., the British commander reported again, saying that "one Strasbourg-class battlecruiser was injured and ran aground, and two 'Bretagne'-class battleships were one sunk and one injured, and two French destroyers and one aircraft carrier were sunk or destroyed. While this tragic battle was in progress, another battlecruiser, the 'Strasbourg' or 'Dunkerque,' tried to leave the port in order to sail to Toulon or a port in North Africa, and placed itself under German control in accordance with the Bordeaux government's armistice conditions. However, the crew members may not have known it. The British fleet's aircraft attacked it, and the ship was hit by at least one torpedo. However, the ship may have contacted several French ships that sailed out of Algiers at night, and was able to reach Toulon, which we could not pursue. The 'Dunkerque' has been injured and will not be able to fight for several months.

Mocking the Italian Navy Standing idly by

Although the French warships fought for an unnatural reason, they showed the courage characteristic of the French Navy during the war, which is needless for me to say. The French commander and his subordinates felt that they had to comply with the orders issued by their government under German direction. We must give them all kinds of forgiveness. I am afraid that the loss of life among the French people and in the harbor will be quite large, because we were forced to use very violent force, and I heard several major explosions. In this battle, the British ships were not affected by the opponent's fierce artillery fire in terms of firepower or action. I have not yet received reports of British casualties, but the fleet commanded by Vice Admiral Somerville is intact in all military aspects and ready to fight again (cheers from the audience). The Italian Navy, which we are also prepared to deal with, whose number of ships is certainly greater than the British ships fighting at Mers-el-Kébir, carefully avoided it (great laughter). However, in the battle we are about to wage to consolidate its control of the Mediterranean, the Italian Navy will eventually be damaged. To this day, a large part of the French fleet has been transferred into our hands, or is unable to participate in the war, or has escaped German power. As for the French ships that are still free at sea, we are determined to do our best to prevent them from falling into German hands. Let the Congress judge the merits and demerits of our actions this time, let the people judge, let the United States judge, let the world judge, and let history judge (great cheers from the audience).

Fully Prepared to Cope with the Offensive

At this point, I would like to talk about the near future. We certainly expect the enemy to attack, and we are now doing our best to make various preparations. Whether the enemy attacks Britain or Ireland, we will be able to defeat them. All the people of Ireland, regardless of their faith or party affiliation, should know that Ireland is in imminent danger. We know this very well, so we are engaged in arrangements from morning to night. However, there is no benefit in publicly discussing this matter. Even in secret meetings, the government must make some reservations. I ask the British people and those who sympathize with us on both sides of the Atlantic to give us their greatest assistance. We are now facing a time of great danger and glorious hope with its autonomous regions. All the virtues of our nation will be tested. This is not a time for doubt or weakness, but a very important time for us to answer the call. I would now like to read to the House a document that I have sent to those who hold important positions under the Crown. I would be happy to send this document to all the members for their adoption, but not because they need this advice. The document says, "Before the enemy's invasion, the Prime Minister would like to encourage those in responsible positions in the government to be vigilant and self-respecting. Any precautions must be taken. Since time and method are both available, there is no reason to say that the enemy can land in Britain from the air or the sea in greater numbers than our current army can annihilate or capture. The Air Force is extremely well-organized and powerful, unprecedented. The German Navy has never been so weak as it is today, and the British Home Army has never been so strong as it is today. I expect all senior officials to set an example of stability and determination, and to stop or condemn the opinions of those around them or subordinates who express indigestion. If any official is seen to be deliberately using forces that disturb people's hearts or weaken people's spirits, or making such statements, they should be reported immediately or dismissed. Only in this way will we not be ashamed of the soldiers who fearlessly defend the enemy on land, sea, and air.

Seeking Victory, Never Making Peace

In short, I feel that we should get the trust of the House (cheers from the audience). The members should believe that no matter how difficult our duties are, we will never be negligent. The actions we have already taken are enough to forever dispel the slanders and rumors spread by German propagandists in the United States and elsewhere, and created by the Fifth Column in Britain. They said that we have chapters for peace with the enemy. All of this should be completely dispelled by the painful and severe actions we were forced to take. In this country, which has long been known for its love of peace, there is no thought of making peace. Not only that, but we also want to wage war with the greatest courage and all means until the just goals we are fighting for have been achieved (Reuters, 5th).

### British Planes Launch Large-Scale Air Raids on Europe Throughout the Night: German Planes Also Bomb London

London - Britain launched a large-scale air raid on Europe yesterday to break Hitler's plan to invade the three islands. British planes successfully bombed German transport ships in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, and German transport planes staying in Belgium. According to officials, other British planes flew to Germany and bombed at least twelve German cities. German military supply depots in Belgium were also hit and destroyed. The German transport ship sunk in Rotterdam is widely believed to have been used to transport troops to London (International News Agency, 5th).

London - The Air Ministry announced that the British Air Force flew day and night to Europe for larger-scale bombings. On Wednesday, British bombers attacked enemy oil plants, transportation lines, and storage depots, as well as ships near Rotterdam and Schoorl, and aircraft yards and troop transport planes in Eben-Emael in Belgium. The explosions caused fires and damage. High-explosive bombs in the hangar at the Eben-Emael airfield immediately caught fire. Enemy aircraft in The Hague airfield were also hit. All British planes returned safely. The weather was unfavorable for flying at night, but British planes still flew to the Aachen airfield in Germany, the Twente airfield in the Netherlands, and the Mauville airfield in France for large-scale attacks. One British plane was missing. A German military headquarters communiqué stated that 75 British planes were destroyed between June 23 and July 4. In fact, during this period, British planes only lost 30 planes. The enemy admitted to losing only 12 planes, but in reality, the British Air Force destroyed 40 enemy planes (Reuters, 5th).

London - The Admiralty, Air Ministry, and Internal Security Department issued a communiqué yesterday stating that enemy aircraft flew close to a certain port on the coast of the Strait today. A naval auxiliary ship in Portland Harbor was hit and caught fire. A small tugboat and a barge each sank. The houses were slightly damaged. Several civilians were killed or injured. Another batch of enemy aircraft invaded southwestern England and dropped bombs, but did not hit military targets. No deaths or injuries were reported. Anti-aircraft guns fired in several places, and fighter planes also took off for combat. According to the news received so far, a British fighter plane patrol shot down an enemy bomber. It has now been confirmed that seven enemy planes were shot down during the enemy attack on Britain on Wednesday. A German plane was shot down by anti-aircraft fire in southwestern England yesterday. Three crew members died. The other two parachuted down and were reportedly arrested. British planes engaged enemy fighter planes off the south coast of England last night. One enemy plane was shot down at sea. Another enemy plane was severely damaged. Enemy planes tried to attack the southeastern coast of England last night. British planes intercepted them and aerial battles occurred. The German planes were driven out to sea and did not drop bombs (Reuters, 5th).

### Iraqi Prime Minister Returns Visit to Turkey

Istanbul - According to reports here, Iraqi Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Said's visit to Istanbul this time is of considerable benefit to both Turkey and Iraq. The two governments have very harmonious opinions on general issues, and the friendship between the two countries has been further guaranteed. Both the Turkish Prime Minister and Foreign Minister attended the discussion (Haitong News Agency, 5th).

London - Reuters learned from well-informed oil industry sources that the oil pipeline connecting the Mosul oil wells and the French Mandate of Syria has stopped transporting oil for the past three weeks. After the implementation of this measure, the oil produced by this oil field can avoid falling into enemy hands. The pipeline between the Mosul oil field and Haifa is still transporting oil as usual (Reuters, 5th).

### Pro-German Cabinet Established in Romania: Anti-Semitic Colors Unusually Strong: Strengthening Relations with the Axis Powers

Bucharest - Romania formed a new government yesterday afternoon. Its line-up is as follows: Prime Minister Gigurtu (newly appointed), Associate Prime Minister General Mihail (newly appointed), Foreign Minister Manolescu (newly appointed), Minister of Labor Gigescu (newly appointed), Minister of Transportation Macovei (incumbent), Minister of Economy Leon (newly appointed), Minister of the Interior Popescu (newly appointed), Minister of the Army Niculescu (newly appointed), Minister of the Navy and Air Force Admiral Petrescu (newly appointed), Minister of National Groups Roşu (newly appointed), Minister of Culture Şeima (newly appointed), Minister of Health Professor Comou (newly appointed), Minister of Propaganda Professor Cleiniceanu (newly appointed), Minister of Education Caracosti (newly appointed), Minister of Justice Gruia (newly appointed) (Haitong News Agency, 5th).

Bucharest - The Romanian government led by Gigurtu will adopt a decisive pro-German policy. Its most prominent symbol is the appointment of German Senator Roşu as Minister of National Groups. At the same time, Foreign Minister Manolescu, Minister of Education Caracosti, and Minister of Health Cleiniceanu have extremely close scientific ties with Germany. The anti-Jewish colors of the new Romanian cabinet are unusually strong, and it can be directly called a pro-German and anti-Jewish cabinet (Haitong News Agency, 5th).

Bucharest - New Prime Minister Gigurtu declared today that faithfully participating in the German-Italian axis system is the cornerstone of Romania's new foreign policy. The Romanian government understands the national sentiment and believes that this foreign policy is not only in line with international relations, but also in harmony with political concepts. The Romanian government is determined to maintain close relations with its neighboring countries, because the maintenance of peace in Southeast Europe is an indispensable factor in creating a good political order. The various regional alliances concluded by Romania are steps to implement this policy. In terms of domestic affairs, the Romanian government is determined to maintain security and order, and those who spread rumors must be stopped. Romania's military strength must be enhanced, and various economic problems will be solved through cooperation. The refugee problems in Bessarabia and Bukovina will also be resolved quickly (Haitong News Agency, 5th).

### Soviet Union Uses German White Paper to Defend Its Defense Policy; Pravda Denounces Anglo-French Anti-Soviet Conspiracy

Moscow. Following the publication of the German Fifth and Sixth White Papers, Izvestia commented, "The instigators of the war have clearly failed militarily, and one of the results is the leakage of the most secret documents, which fully demonstrate the authors' predatory policies. Today, we are publishing relevant documents from the German Fifth and Sixth White Papers. These documents reveal the Anglo-French plans to attack the Soviet Union and the scandalous participation of several neighboring countries (Turkey and Iran) in these plans. These documents further prove that the Soviet Union should strengthen its northern and southern defenses and be vigilant along the borders with Finland, the Baltic States, Romania, and Turkey. Britain and France continue to spread rumors that the steps taken by the Soviet Union in Finland and the Baltic States are a threat to Germany. The purpose of spreading these rumors is twofold: first, to undermine German-Soviet relations, but German-Soviet relations have already been determined by the existing agreements between the two countries, and conspirators will have no way to undermine them. Second, the authors of these documents intend to use these rumors as a smokescreen for their anti-Soviet conspiracy. The defensive measures taken by the Soviet Union have timely thwarted the anti-Soviet plans of British and French imperialism. This point has been fully proven by the Sixth White Paper. At the Sixth Session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, Molotov said, 'Since the Soviet Union is unwilling to be used by Britain and France to fight Germany, it must be prepared to deal with their extreme hostility towards the Soviet Union.' Today, the documents we are publishing prove the depth of British and French hostility towards us, as evidenced by the poisonous nature of their anti-Soviet plans. They are doing everything they can to prepare to attack our country in the north, south, and southeast, while at the same time using various provocative acts to force the Soviet Union to abandon its neutral position. In short, this plan has exhausted all possibilities of ingenuity and ruthlessness. Everyone knows that General Gamelin has ingloriously ended his life's work. He had a plan to assist the Finnish Defense Forces in attacking the Soviet Union and boasted of the 'spiritual' benefits of this assistance. The authors of these documents attempted to drag other countries into the war for their own benefit. The organizers of the war first used Finland as a test case. Gamelin planned to directly intervene in the Finnish war, with British and French troops landing in Petsamo and seizing Swedish and Norwegian seaports. But whether the benefits gained were as accurate as Gamelin predicted can be judged from Gamelin's fate. Gamelin's judgment was not too bad in terms of commercial bookkeeping, but it was indeed wrong militarily. The ruling class in London was extremely disappointed after the defeat of the Finnish Defense Forces and the signing of a peace treaty between the Soviet Union and Finland. In view of the above facts, this disappointment is not without reason. After the failure of the northern advance, the anti-Soviet organizers shifted their activities southward. They planned to attack our Caucasus. General Weygand planned to bomb Soviet oil wells. Regarding this matter, the French ambassador to Turkey, Massigli, reported the possible consequences to his superiors. This bombing would be a cruel massacre and destruction, but at the very least, it would force the Soviet Union to join the war. As for the plan to bomb Baku and Batumi, it is particularly noteworthy. According to the French ambassador to Turkey, he had discussed this matter in detail with the Turkish Foreign Minister, Saracoğlu. At that time, the Foreign Minister expressed his determination to do his best to help implement this plan. In addition, Iran's role in the Turkish plan was also clarified during the friendly discussions mentioned above. However, since Turkey and Iran have signed non-aggression treaties with the Soviet Union, how could they participate in such a conspiracy? Although Turkey and Iran are willing to be driven by imperialism, this kind of foreign policy decision is to be expected. They must first exchange documents on 'maintaining peace,' and then sign so-called 'guarantees,' but the result will inevitably be that the initiators bear the brunt. The materials in the Fifth White Paper fully prove this point. These materials show the methods used by Britain and France to force the Netherlands and Belgium to fight for them, and at the same time confirm that the firm stance of the leaders of Belgium and the Netherlands has made it impossible for Britain and France to use the two countries as military bases for attacking Germany. The documents published today have fully demonstrated the names of all countries preparing to attack the Soviet Union. The great Soviet Union does not fear the conspirators of imperialism. It will continue to take various steps to ensure the safety of the Soviet people and their happy lives. In this regard, the new documents have not and cannot change everything at the same time. The value of these documents lies in their accurate depiction of the division of labor in the imperialist camp, so that we can make a deduction." (TASS, 5th)

### Estonian Army Cooperates with the Soviet Union

Tallinn. The Commander-in-Chief of the Estonian Army, Johnson, delivered a radio address last night, announcing the appointment of political commissars to the Estonian Army, whose work is to provide political training to officers and soldiers. Johnson declared that the Estonian Army must cooperate closely with the Soviet Army to make the Estonian Army more prepared. To achieve this goal, not only must the technical equipment be improved, but the discipline of each soldier must also be strictly trained. (Haitong Telegraph, 5th)

### German Foreign Ministry Publishes the Sixth White Paper, Anglo-French Diplomatic Activities in Turkey (Continued)

Berlin. The sixth document in the Sixth Volume of the German White Paper is a secret report from the French Ambassador to Turkey, Massigli, sent back to the French Foreign Ministry by special messenger. Massigli discussed the possibility of Anglo-French air strikes on the Baku oil region of Soviet Russia, advocating that Britain and France should bypass Turkey and Iran and carry out bombing raids on the Baku oil region, and advocating that the Turkish government should not be notified in advance to avoid unnecessary unpleasantness. In the future, either wait until the facts are accomplished, or wait until the opportunity is in progress, and then notify the Turkish authorities. If an apology is made to Turkey, it is indicated that the plane will pass through Turkish territory. If the Soviet Union protests to Turkey, Turkey can indicate that it has never heard of it in advance. If the situation is too serious, Turkey can declare to the parliament that the blame lies with Soviet Russia, because Soviet Russia caused the trouble. Massigli's secret report also revealed that Britain and France hoped that Turkey would immediately join the war, but Turkey was quite reluctant for various reasons. In the report, Massigli also discussed the issue of control of the Black Sea, believing that the ships of the five countries of Soviet Romania, Germany, could be controlled, advocating that the detained ships should be taken to ports for confiscation of ships and cargo. Finally, Massigli believed that bombing the Baku oil region would not cause any major consequences, but would instead provide Turkey with more convenience for the Allied countries, and at the same time, control of the Black Sea would be easier to implement. (Haitong Telegraph, 4th)

Berlin. The German Foreign Ministry continued to publish the sequel to the Sixth White Paper last night, that is, Section 7 of the document archives copied by the French General Staff was a letter from French Prime Minister Daladier to Gamelin on January 19, 1940, asking him to draft a plan to destroy the Soviet Russian oil fields. The original letter is as follows: Regarding the plan to destroy the Soviet Russian oil fields, the Army Commander-in-Chief Gamelin and the Navy Commander-in-Chief Darlan are responsible for drafting it. The main points are as follows: (1) Cut off the oil transported to Germany via the Black Sea; (2) Directly intervene in the Caucasus; (3) Do not directly conflict with Soviet Russia, but take steps to support the independence of the Caucasian Muslims (Haitong Telegraph, 4th)

Berlin. Section 8 of the German White Paper is the understanding between the British and French Air Forces regarding the bombing of oil fields. The original text is as follows: "April 5 (Confidential Regarding the bombing of the Caucasian oil fields, the British and French Air Forces have reached an understanding. The British and French bombing targets are limited to the oil fields and seaports of Baku, destroying 20% to 30% of them within six days. The air force sent will include six French aircraft and three British aircraft, a total of 90 to 100 aircraft, with each flight plan dropping 70 tons of bombs. (Haitong Telegraph, 4th)

Berlin. The German Foreign Ministry yesterday continued to publish the documents copied from the French General Staff, the 17th of which was a telegram from General Weygand to General Li Long, the military attaché of the French Embassy in the United Kingdom, on May 28, 1940, declaring that the French naval commander in Dunkirk requested the United Kingdom to provide more assistance in the naval and air forces. "I do not doubt that the British authorities cannot understand this need, but please urge its realization." Regarding this matter, Weygand sent a telegram to the French commander on May 30, 1940, reiterating the previous request. This is the 18th document. The telegram said, "At present, there are only three squadrons of fighter jets of the British Air Force on our territory, and the rest have returned to the United Kingdom. The center of the war is entirely on the shoulders of France. I respectfully appeal to your Commander-in-Chief in the name of the Commander-in-Chief of the French Army. I hope to understand the seriousness of the situation and take all necessary measures to dispatch large squadrons of fighter jets to France to participate in the war. I am very eager." Signed by Weygand."

The 19th document was a telegram from Weygand to the British Commander-in-Chief, after the French covered the British retreat from Dunkirk, declaring that the Dunkirk garrison commander requested the United Kingdom to transfer all available troops to the command of the French army, because the British army was able to withdraw entirely as a result of the heroic resistance of the French army to cover it, so he deeply hoped to accept this request, and that the British and French armies would cooperate effectively and no longer allow the French rearguard to sacrifice in vain.

The 20th document was a letter from Weygand to Prime Minister Reynaud on June 2, requesting Reynaud to quickly ask the United Kingdom to increase military assistance. The original letter is as follows: "Dear Prime Minister, our air force cannot provide sufficient support to the army. The situation is tight. I would like to urge the British Prime Minister to take action in this direction and await orders with bated breath." The letter was accompanied by a letter from General Villemin, Commander-in-Chief of the French Air Force, detailing the seriousness of the war situation, emphasizing that if British and French fighter jets could not intercept the activities of German bombers in large numbers, the German advance could not be contained. Since French aircraft must send a part to Southeast Africa to increase defense, unless the United Kingdom sends a large squadron of aircraft, the task of eliminating enemy bombers cannot be carried out. If this assistance cannot be obtained immediately, the French army may fail. Therefore, I believe that this is a struggle for the survival of Britain and France, and I deeply hope that this request can be realized immediately." (Haitong Telegraph, 5th)

### US Interior Secretary Ridicules Superman in Independence Day Speech

Washington. US Interior Secretary Ickes delivered a shocking speech on Independence Day night, mocking those across the Atlantic who call themselves "supermen" and call Britain decadent. Although Ickes did not mention any names, it is generally believed that he was referring to Hitler and the Nazis. He said that these supermen have completely surrendered their will and body to the absolute will of the master who commands them how to act. They are willing to be humiliated and allow whippings and destruction. Freedom of speech, reading, and marriage have been lost. This superior and powerful people obey their master, violate promises and trample on peaceful lands, destroy the lives of children, and hope for undue gains. They willingly submit to the new God established by their dictators. If Lincoln listened to him, he would tell him that whoever wants to rule others is not enough to say this without obtaining the approval of that person. I wonder when these supermen will use these words to deal with their dictators. (Reuters, 5th)

### British Empire Expresses Determination to Fight, Colonies Are Greatly Excited

London. Radio Sydney in Australia said that Australia was very satisfied to receive the news of the Anglo-French military action against the French fleet. (Reuters, 5th)

Shanghai-Ottawa. According to observations, Churchill's remarks on the disposal of the French fleet encouraged the Canadian people more than any event since the outbreak of the war. According to the general opinion of the Canadian people, this move by the British side is indeed quite difficult, but it can indeed show the determination of the British Empire to fight to the end. (Reuters, 5th)

London. If the French fleet in British hands today needs to add personnel, Canada can supply it. Canadian naval volunteers and reservists have been training in the United Kingdom for some time, and other volunteers will follow suit. British naval officers praised the Canadians for their ingenuity, saying that these people would be valuable assets in the British Navy. (Reuters

Education

### Recent Work of the Institute of Physics, Peiping Academy

(Kunming Correspondence) Since the Institute of Physics of the National Peiping Academy moved to Yunnan, in addition to continuing some of the original research, it has been engaged in practical applications and physical research with local characteristics. The following is a brief description of the recent work:

(A) Regarding geophysics: (1) "Measurement of Gravitational Acceleration in Northwest Yunnan." Two years ago, the Institute sent assistant Zhang Hongji to Yunnan twice along the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway and the Jingdian Highway to measure gravitational acceleration. Last winter, Zhang Junfu set off along the Yunnan-Myanmar Highway to measure the gravitational acceleration of more than 40 places including Dali, Baoshan, Longling, Mangshi, Mengmao, Tengchong, Lijiang, and Xiangyun. The results were published in the French Academy of Sciences Weekly and submitted to the Seventh International Association of Geophysics and Geodesy held in Washington in September this year. (2) "Re-measurement of the Latitude and Longitude of Kunming." Using the altimeter of the Institute, Liu Chaoyang re-measured the results at Yunnan University as 102041'58"88 east longitude and 2503'22"05 north latitude. (3) "Geomagnetic Anomaly in Ciba, Kunming." The geomagnetic anomaly near Ciba is extremely large, with a difference of up to two degrees in declination within a few meters. After Gu Gongxu used a magnetometer to carefully measure Wenling, he determined that the anomaly was due to the surface red soil. (4) "Physical Exploration of the Yimen Iron Mine." Gu Gongxu is an expert in using geophysical methods to explore mineral deposits. After returning to China last autumn, he immediately engaged in the preparation of various methods and instruments. In September this year, he responded to the call of the Yimen Iron Mine Bureau of the Resources Committee and carried an electromagnetic instrument to work with Zhang Hongji.

(B) Regarding applied optics, the Institute originally established an optical workshop for the convenience of its own research and to promote this technology. Now, due to the needs, it is engaged in the manufacture of rangefinders and periscopes, and the design of photographic lenses and microscope lenses.

(C) Regarding optics: (1) Research on the ultraviolet absorption spectrum of salicylic acid and lithium salicylate vapor; (2) Research on the absorption spectrum of salicylic acid and its alkali metals; (3) The effect of pressure on X-ray photography. All of the above three works have yielded results and have recently been published in the French Academy of Sciences Weekly. (4) Atmospheric ozone observation.

(D) Regarding radio, continue the research on crystal column vibration and the supply of crystal oscillators for various radio stations in our country.

### Exciting Basketball Today, Paramount vs. Shanghai Youth, Two Giants of Chinese and Western Youth Reunite, Important Game of the United Cup A Group

The fifth act of the United Cup Charity Basketball has extremely exciting programs today, with a total of two games. The first act starts at 5:30 pm (new time), with Xihua vs. Shangxing, which is also an exciting scene in Group A2. The finale is the reunion of the two giants of Paramount and Shanghai Youth. The two teams were the champions of the last Chinese and Western Youth Championships, which is already well known. Both sides have recently replenished their strength. Paramount has obtained the assistance of the tall player Bao Songyuan, and the lineup is even more abundant. On the Shanghai Youth side, because of the merger of Chen Xuechong, Shen Yugong, and Ren Xiangcheng from the former Hualian team, it is even more powerful. The outcome of today's reunion cannot be estimated based on the performance of the two sides in the Chinese and Western Youth Charity Basketball Tournament a few months ago. Paramount advocates a man-to-man strategy, and its smoke screen offensive and slow offensive strategy have particularly learned skills. In terms of individuals and cooperation, it is deeply rich in scientific meaning. On the Shanghai Youth side, in addition to Chen Xuechong being an old partner of Paramount, the other generals are actually a mixed product of Hualian and Guoguang. Hualian would have been a champion with the Northern School, so Shanghai Youth has formed a pure Northern School team. Today's reunion of the two giants should be the first exciting scene of the season. It is expected that the audience will definitely go crazy, unwilling to miss this feast for the eyes. Tickets are all one yuan. In order to maintain order, it will be limited to 400 tickets, which will be sold starting at 4:00 pm.

The revenue from tickets for each game will be allocated to the expenses of the Orphanage. In order to reward the enthusiasm of the audience for donating generously, the hospital will still send a military band to the venue today to play music to adjust the atmosphere of the stadium. The program is as follows: Xihua vs. Shangxing (Group A2) 5:30 pm Wang Jien, Shanghai Youth vs. Paramount (Group A1) 6:30 pm Zhou Jiaqi, Qu Honglu, Paramount (Group A) Chen Xianglong, Lu Zhongen, Li Zhenzhong, Zhang Shaoqing, Wang Jinghu, Zhou Zhi, Feng Nianhua, Bao Songyuan, Lu Zhonghui, Sun Baoqing, Xu Wenkui,

### The Way for Middle School and University Students to Spend Summer Vacation

— Chen Qingshi

— Written for this newspaper's summer essays by middle school and university students —

Mr. Chen is the head of the Chinese Education Department of the Public Concession's Bureau of Works. Regarding summer assignments for middle school and university students, he suggests collective research on pressing issues, selective reading of famous works, rotating reports, uniting like-minded individuals, visiting various institutions, understanding the reality of society, and striving to perform social services to eliminate illiteracy. These four points are all extremely valuable suggestions. No matter which point is written about in the submitted essay, it will be a work of substance. (Editor)

The question of whether or not school summer vacations should be abolished or shortened has sparked heated discussions in domestic education circles. Both proponents and opponents have considerable reasons for their positions. This issue will be put aside for now, but regardless, we should not let these two precious months pass in vain. I think everyone can agree with that. Summer vacation should not be spent idly playing, but should have fixed tasks. I would like to explain this from the following points:

1. From the Perspective of Learning: Learning either progresses or regresses. Some people use standardized tests to compare students' scores during and after summer vacation. The results show that the scores after summer vacation are worse, which is clear proof that learning either progresses or regresses. Modern youth are in a time of national crisis, and they should be striving to become stronger, uphold the spirit of continuous self-improvement, seek their own development, and prepare to serve society and the country in the future. Seeking enjoyment and comfort are things that young people should avoid at all costs.

2. From the Perspective of Health: A disciplined life and regular routines are essential for maintaining health. Students' lives in school can be said to meet the above conditions, but many people often lead chaotic lives during summer vacation. Their daily routines and schedules are irregular, resulting in listlessness and affecting their physical health. This is extremely inappropriate.

So how should young students use their summer vacation? Individuals have different circumstances and opportunities, so there cannot be a uniform regulation. The following types of tasks may be helpful for reference:

1. Group Research: Under the current school system, students spend most of their time on textbooks, while neglecting many issues that are of great concern to young people or in which they have a deep interest. This is inherently wrong. I think students can use the summer vacation to gather like-minded classmates and organize discussion groups. In a relatively free environment and a more lively atmosphere, they can study and discuss these important issues. In order to make this kind of discussion group successful, a detailed plan must be made in advance regarding the issue to be discussed, the scope of the discussion, the collection of materials, and the participants, so as to avoid making hasty preparations and doing things perfunctorily.

2. Selected Readings of Famous Works: Students in school spend all day holding several textbooks, but have no time to explore many famous works that everyone should read. This is a pity. Students can use the summer vacation to select several famous works under the guidance of teachers, exchange readings, and report in turn. I think they will definitely gain a lot.

3. Collective Visits: Shanghai has a plethora of institutions. Students who are usually confined within the walls of the school can use the summer vacation to organize visiting groups and visit various institutions in turn to increase their understanding of society.

4. Social Service: A social service work that young students should do within their capacity during the summer vacation is to eliminate illiteracy. There are so many illiterate people in our country that unless the entire intellectual class (including students) is mobilized, it is impossible to eliminate illiteracy. This is an obligation that we educated people owe to society, and a responsibility that cannot be shirked.

### Finance: The Number of Sellers of Foreign Exchange Continues to Increase

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no changes in HSBC's listed prices. The black market for British and American currencies continued to weaken. The US dollar was seen at 6.375 yuan. Speculators and Chinese banks were unanimously selling pounds for multiple times around the four shillings level outside the customs. Other foreign banks were eager to supply, so prices were repeatedly lowered. In the morning, because HSBC still had an appetite for buying, foreign firms took advantage of the low prices to settle, and there was a brief rebound. However, because the market was flooded with chips, the result was still weak. The market situation in the afternoon was quite calm, with very little trading activity, and the price was slightly soft, but eventually stabilized. There were various rumors in the market, but they were not taken seriously by operators, so there was no reaction. At the close, British gold was at 3 shillings 953125, and the US dollar was at 6.3125 yuan, up 0.015625 and 0.0325 respectively compared to the previous day. The trend of futures was the same.

British Gold Almost at Four Shillings

At the beginning of the morning, the London price fell nearly 0.03125 yuan. American banks were closed, and London spot gold was fixed. The exchange rate of British currency against the US dollar was unchanged, but it was up 0.03125 yuan against Shanghai. There was no report for France. There was no report for the US dollar against British currency, Shanghai, etc., as the previous day was a holiday. The central bank's listed prices for various currencies remained the same. Banks opened in the morning with spot selling prices of 3 shillings 9375 for British gold and 6.28125 yuan for the US dollar. Compared to the previous day's close, both British and American currencies were flat. After opening, in addition to the unusually eager supply from American banks, Chinese banks followed suit by dumping and speculating, and speculators were very enthusiastic about selling. The market immediately showed signs of weakness. HSBC's listed price was announced and remained unchanged. The silver equalization tax was announced and there were no increases or decreases. At that time, the July US dollar was traded at 6.3125 yuan offered by American banks, while speculators and Chinese banks sold spot US dollars to foreign banks at 6.375 yuan. The July US dollar was also traded at 6.3115 yuan. The spot pound was absorbed by HSBC from speculators at 3 shillings 96875. Later, foreign banks and Chinese banks continued to sell, but HSBC bought in from time to time. Soon, foreign firms saw low prices and came to settle, and the underlying trend turned from weak to soft. The spot US dollar was traded by foreign firms withdrawing from foreign banks at 6.25 yuan, and the July US dollar was reported at 6.1875 yuan. Spot British gold was seen at 3 shillings 921875. Near noon, buyers withdrew, and the market rebounded. As a result, spot US dollars were at 6.3125 yuan and British gold was at 3 shillings 953125, with US dollars down 0.03125 yuan and British currency up 0.015625 yuan compared to the morning opening.

Chinese Banks Made Deals for July

The afternoon was quite quiet, with very few transactions. It was only heard that Chinese banks were making deals, with the July US dollar at 6.28125 yuan. The price seemed slightly soft, but until the evening close, it was eventually reported to be flat. The price was the same as the afternoon close, with spot British gold at 3 shillings 953125 and the US dollar at 6.3125 yuan. The July British gold was at 3 shillings 921875, and the US dollar was at 6.28125 yuan, up 0.03125 and 0.015625 respectively compared to the previous day's close.

Hong Kong US Dollar Slightly Weaker

Hong Kong, 5th (Friday) Telegram: This morning's exchange market opened with British currency in Shanghai reported flat, and the US dollar fluctuating. There were no changes in the British, American, and Japanese currencies. The spot Shanghai currency dropped by one yuan to 375 yuan, and was reported flat at 11:30 AM. The spot Shanghai currency rose by one yuan to 376 yuan, and was reported flat at 2:30 PM. The spot US dollar weakened by 0.0625 to 23.875 yuan. The rest remained unchanged.

Tianjin British Currency Flat, US Dollar Strengthened

Tianjin, 5th (Friday) Telegram: This morning's exchange market opened flat. The spot British currency remained at 3 shillings 5625. The spot US dollar weakened by 2.15 to 5.75 yuan. Shanghai currency dropped by 2.5 jiao to 109.75 yuan. The black market price of "Joint Notes" was 5.75 yuan higher, at 90.025 yuan.

### US Dollar Fluctuates

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw British and American gold pounds ultimately weaken due to "shia chik" (cash settlement), so they both continued to fall by one yuan. The supply and demand for British gold notes was still even in the morning, but the selling pressure was slightly stronger in the afternoon, and the market price eventually fell by five jiao. The American gold note fell first and then rose, and after rising, it fell again, and finally rebounded again. The result was the same as the day before. The supply of Japanese gold notes was quite smooth in the morning, and the market price fell. In the afternoon, the demand was strong again, and the market price rebounded, eventually reporting a slight increase of 0.001 yuan. The black market price was 1.136 yuan.

### Hong Kong Group Suddenly Buys Gold; 5,000 Yuan Barrier Broken Three Times and Then Rebounded

Yesterday's cash "shia chik" (cash settlement) black market situation, inheriting the tired momentum from the previous day, fell miserably into the 5,000 yuan barrier, creating a recent new low of 4,950 yuan. This was because people's hearts were decayed, and there were occasional cases of painful settlements after many households suffered losses. It opened at 5,050 yuan in the early morning, down 80 yuan. Subsequently, after the gold shops dumped, it broke into the 5,000 yuan barrier, first seeing a low of 4,950 yuan. However, at that time, those who saw low prices and wanted to buy were also quite crowded. For example, the Hong Kong group of securities companies and a certain jewelry store entered the market to buy, pulling up to 5,080 yuan for the second time. Although it fell again later, the Hong Kong group and a certain household still absorbed it, rising to 5,130 yuan. Unfortunately, many overnight households and money exchange businesses suddenly dumped a lot, resulting in the afternoon close of only 5,035 yuan. After the afternoon opening, the Hong Kong group continued to buy, from 5,050 yuan to 5,070 yuan. Before long, the silver firms sold, falling to 560 yuan. Fortunately, the Hong Kong group worked tirelessly to pull it up, and it rose to 5,105 yuan before the close. The result was 5,095 yuan, down 35 yuan from the previous day. The entire day's transactions were about 4,000 taels. The jewelry gold hung down 10 yuan, and the customs gold, etc., remained flat.

"Shia Chik" Only Down 35 Yuan

Since the morning, the exchange rate reported stronger for each bar (10 taels), and people's hearts were extremely tired. The market opened with a sharp drop of 80 yuan. The silver firm paid the money exchange business 10 taels, for 5,050 yuan. Subsequently, under the selling pressure from gold shops and silver firms, it plummeted another 100 yuan, miserably entering the 5,000 yuan barrier. The silver firm entered the gold shop for 10 taels, inferior to 4,950 yuan. Later, a certain jewelry store saw the low price and frantically bought on behalf of the Hong Kong group. At the same time, a certain gold shop was also happy to absorb it, and then it rebounded by 130 yuan. The silver firms made deals with each other for 10 taels, for 5,080 yuan. However, before long, the buying momentum gradually dissipated, and a certain money exchange business tended to sell, and the price fell again, again entering within 5,000 yuan. The gold shop paid the silver firm 20 taels, retreating to 4,960 yuan. After this, the exchange market suddenly reported a shift to tight, which immediately stimulated considerable buying momentum. In the midst of silver firms and gold shops pulling, it rebounded again by 170 yuan. The silver firms mutually made deals for 20 taels, for 5,130 yuan. Unexpectedly, at that time, the foreign exchange market reported a loosening again, and money exchange businesses and securities groups rushed to sell, and casual observers also sold. It was lowered again by 130 yuan. The gold shop paid the silver firm 20 taels, reducing to 5,000 yuan. At noon, the selling momentum slightly subsided, and it rebounded by 35 yuan. The money exchange business entered the silver firm for 30 taels, using 5,035 yuan as the noon closing price. The situation was still good when the market opened in the afternoon, and it was immediately raised by 15 yuan. The money exchange business entered the silver firm for 20 taels, for 5,050 yuan. Subsequently, because a certain jewelry store had a considerable appetite, it rose another 20 yuan. The silver firms mutually made deals for 50 taels, for 5,070 yuan. Soon, a certain silver firm and securities group vigorously sold, and at that time, a certain jewelry store stopped its activities, causing it to decline slightly by 55 yuan. The money exchange business paid the gold shop 30 taels for 5,015 yuan. After entering, a certain jewelry store's buying intentions rekindled, and some money exchange businesses, gold shops, and securities groups came to search and buy, and they immediately swarmed to the 5,100 yuan barrier. The gold shop entered the silver firm for 20 taels, rising to 5,105 yuan. Before the close, the money exchange business slightly dumped, rebounding by 10 yuan. The money exchange business paid the gold shop 10 taels, for 5,095 yuan, using it as the evening closing price. The result was 35 yuan less than the previous day. The total daily range was 180 yuan. The cash shop's own brand gold selling price, according to "shia chik," was more than 10 yuan higher, and the buying price was reduced by 30 yuan. Currently, the standard gold is more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there is very little trading.

Jewelry Gold Also Lingered Down 10 Yuan

At the beginning, the gold for jewelry from the major firms was still suspended at 530 yuan per tael. Around 10:00 AM, it hung down 10 yuan. At 11:00 AM, it rebounded by 10 yuan. At noon, it hung down again by 10 yuan. There were no changes in the afternoon. It is estimated that the major firms changed the suspension to 520 yuan. The new firms were the same as the above prices. The buying price was reduced by about 30 yuan.

### Securities: Category D Stocks Show Particularly Strong Gains

The black market for securities continued to be good yesterday, especially with the particularly strong gains in Category D stocks. After the market price trended upwards, all bonds had already risen a lot, but Category D stocks were still relatively cheap, so they were particularly favored by bullish investors. They suddenly rose about one yuan compared to the previous day, which can be said to be an unprecedented honor for Category D stocks. However, in the afternoon, there was suddenly no market, and it was still in its usual desolate state. There were not many changes in the environment. There has been no official report on Song Ziwen's loan negotiations with the United States, and it is still uncertain. According to the sudden arrival of this upward trend, the fundamental reason is that the principal and interest are about to expire soon. Initially, after a certain bank bought hundreds of thousands, there were rumors of a loan. The surface was also biased towards bullish sentiment. In the past two days, new customers have bought 200,000 to 300,000, so the market price has gradually trended upward in mutual support. However, the gains in Category D stocks have been too rapid, and it is feared that losses are inevitable. Yesterday's transactions were mainly bought by Xie Xingyuan from morning to afternoon for 200,000 to 300,000. Sheng Daxingyuan Chang followed. In the afternoon, Tianfeng Hengfu Renchang and others also bought one after another. Hongkang and No. 16 sold throughout the day. Jiufeng and No. 22 also sold. Lianyi advanced first and then exited, and the trend was strong first and then stabilized. The future may be raised again before more bulls emerge. As a result, all equity shares continued to rise by 0.15 to 0.8 yuan. The total number of transactions was less than one million yuan. A brief table is listed below:

Stock trading: 50 shares of Hanyeping shares were traded at a price of 3.9 yuan.

Yesterday's stock market at the Public Industry Exchange was extremely quiet, with few transactions and no price changes.

London, 4th (Thursday) Telegram: Today's listed prices of Far East British companies' stocks were generally flat. HSBC Bank shares continued to rebound. British registered shares continued to rise by 3 pounds, with a price of 63 pounds. Hong Kong registered shares continued to rise by 2 pounds, with a price of 65 pounds. The rest remained unchanged.

London, 4th (Thursday) Telegram: Today's listed prices of Chinese foreign debt remained stable. There were no changes in any of the high and low grade bonds.

### Yarn and Cotton: Japanese Merchants Purchase Chinese Yarn and Rumored to Be Transporting It to South China for Sale

The yarn market is calm, not escaping its hovering state. However, actual sales are still quite substantial. Hong Kong and Yunnan groups continue to purchase relentlessly, so people's hearts are relatively stable. Market rumors say that yarn mills are automatically reducing work due to the hot summer weather, and business can be reduced. Some people believe that the shortage of cotton yarn chips may cause the market to rebound. In addition, the futures market is not doing well, and the market's inertia is becoming more stable.

The current yarn market opened in the morning due to a poor environment, a looser foreign exchange rate, and a falling gold price. The opening price of 20-count Double Horse yarn fell by 10 yuan to 870 yuan, and continued to fall to 860 yuan. Later, it was heard that Hong Kong's demand was still strong, and people's hearts were revived. The market gradually rose, closing at 885 yuan. It is also said that Japanese merchants transport Chinese yarn to South China for sale, and the profits are very high. The writer slightly inquired about this matter. According to a certain broker, a certain Japanese merchant foreign firm (tiger style) purchased about 100 to 200 bales of 23-count Golden Rooster, Dafeng, and 10-count Special Jincheng. It is still difficult to determine whether this cargo is transported to Guangzhou Bay. However, the people's hearts in the market were a sensation for a while. It was found that the turnover statistics for half a day were 2,425 bales, and the market price of 20-count Double Horse yarn fell by 2 yuan. Today, 130 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong. The amount of purchases by each group is listed on the left:

### The Cotton Market Is Extremely Quiet

The current cotton situation is still as stagnant as ever. Chinese mills have very little demand, but Japanese merchant foreign firms have slightly purchased transactions to be shipped to Japanese mills. However, the amount is very small. The price of Kanggang cotton is 175 yuan, and the delivery price to the factory is 173 yuan, which is a stock exchange transaction of 200 pieces. The future of the cotton market is still difficult to be optimistic about, because the cotton purchased by all parties is coming in steadily, and the money supply is tight.

In other news, the market price of foreign cotton and the New York cotton market were closed all day yesterday for the American Independence Day. The Indian cotton market rose by 2.5 rupees due to purchases by speculators.

The trading of foreign cotton in Shanghai was extremely quiet from beginning to end. It is widely rumored in the market that Japanese merchants are searching for domestic yarn in the market, and as a result, the price of yarn has risen. The cotton market may also be brought up.

### Grain: Nearly 40,000 Bags of Rice Arrive from Hong Kong; Foreign Rice Has a Situation of Breaking the New Price Limit

After the rice market tightened again the other day, people's hearts were still firm when the market opened yesterday morning, not feeling discouraged by the continuous arrival of foreign rice. Instead, they seized the opportunity to support it, and shouts rose one after another. At the same time, general floating speculators and speculators who had been missing for many days suddenly took the lead in major activities, absorbing it in every possible way, stimulating the situation to become more turbulent. The market prices of various foreign rice rose step by step, reaching a peak in an instant, reaching the closing limit line of June 29. At this point, there was no further rise possible, and the overall situation began to stabilize. Sales gradually slowed down, and the profitable goods in hand were released one after another. However, as the market was about to close, there was a lack of opponents, so there was no much change. Only a rebound of 0.2 to 0.3 yuan was seen. As a result, the closing prices were 66 yuan, 65.7 yuan for No. 1 Aged Saigon, 64.5 yuan for No. 2, 65.8 yuan, 65 yuan for No. 1 Siam, 64.5 yuan for No. 2, 65.2 yuan for Fire-Refined, 63.2 yuan for Small-Refined, 62 yuan, 61.5 yuan for Tokyo Broken Tip, 53 yuan to 51.5 yuan for Mixed Broken, and 57 yuan to 54 yuan for Rice Green, which was 0.6 to 0.7 yuan higher than the previous day's closing price. Futures for repayment were especially competed for by both sides. The opening price of No. 2 Siamese rice for June 6 jumped out to 70 yuan to 70.05 yuan, and then rose to 71 yuan, which was 2 yuan higher than the previous day. The opening price of 18-packing was 74 yuan, and then from 74.5 yuan to 75 yuan, which was a huge 3 yuan higher. There were profits returned in the noon market, and the futures market's upward trend had stopped. However, the buying sentiment for spot goods turned weak after the high prices because of the large number of imports in recent days, and there were still whole batches on the way. The noon close was slightly suppressed by 0.3 to 0.5 yuan. Actual sales for the entire day were very strong, with 13,000 to 14,000 bags of spot rice and more than 300 tons of futures opened.

A large amount of foreign rice arrived in Shanghai. The Taikoo Company's Suiyang Wheel arrived in Shanghai at noon, transporting 19,239 bags from Hong Kong and mooring at its own dock in Pudong to unload. Around 2:00 PM, the Taiyuan Wheel also arrived at the port, also loaded with 20,430 bags from Hong Kong, and moored at its own dock on the Bund in the French Concession to unload. Yesterday, the two wheels transported a total of 39,669 bags of foreign rice, a huge amount.

Although there is no source of glutinous rice in the interior, the sales are not as good as the previous day due to the continuous rise in prices, so the situation has turned flat. It is estimated that the opening price of Jinli Baiyuan is still 65 yuan, and Changdan Baiyuan is 634 yuan. However, Hong Kong glutinous rice is in short supply in the market and has a wider path, and it has always taken the lead with foreign rice, sharply increasing by about 2 yuan to an opening price of 67 yuan.

More than a thousand bags of domestic rice such as thick and thin japonica rice continued to arrive at the port. It is rumored that the off-market black market is being suppressed by the continuous arrival of goods in recent days, and people's hearts are calm, making it difficult to compete with foreign rice. The Changbang Special Qing Japonica is still at the original price of 73.5 yuan, 73 yuan, Sukun Changzhou Japonica is 712 yuan, and the next lowest Suxiu is 69 yuan. Thin rice has not been traded at all. Nangang Early Rice is especially 71 yuan 70 yuan, and Zhongguan is still at 69 yuan.

### Fuxin Temporarily Stops Supplying Flour; Wheat Transportation to Shanghai Is Still Difficult to Smooth

Flour: Yesterday's spot flour market situation was even firmer, because the raw materials of the Chinese mills were insufficient. The Fuxin Mill suddenly stopped supplying flour from yesterday, relying only on Fufeng to maintain it alone. The daily wholesale volume was also 5,000 to 6,000 bags. The old brand mill remained at the original price of 15.2 yuan. The factory is quite enthusiastic about the future of people's food, but currently there is no way to buy new wheat in large quantities. Although foreign wheat can be ordered, there are concerns about the arrival of goods in the future. If this continues, it is very worrying. It is heard that the concession authorities are trying to dredge wheat transportation to Shanghai, but it may be difficult to realize in the shortest term. The supply of factory flour is insufficient, and the opportunity for domestic Japanese factory flour to be sold is even better. It is heard that Shuangshi, Jinshan and other flour are being transported in continuously, with prices at 16.1 to 16.2 yuan, and futures at 16.5 to 16.6 yuan. Several thousand bags were traded for each.

Wheat: Yesterday's new wheat sources were still scarce. Except for a certain party directly handling the solution, it has been impossible to transport to Shanghai what Chinese merchants have completed in various places so far, so formal transactions in the market cannot be started for a while. Recently, a batch of transportation permits being negotiated in Wuhu has not had an official response, so the Chinese Fufu factories have proposed to continue ordering Australian foreign wheat, with a total price of about 30 yuan per 100 catties.

### Drought Causes Soybean Cakes to Be Unsalable; Market Is Potentially Becoming Stable

Yesterday's soybean cake market situation was due to sunny weather with no rain, which affected the fertilization of crops, so all parties felt uninterested in buying. Only stockpilers and Shantou Xinghua's interior gang were still active, but the transaction has been reduced compared to before, causing the market to be slightly uneven, so the potential trend is temporarily becoming stable. It is estimated that 3,000 pieces of Dayou Yu Four Brand Cake were traded, with a price of 13.85 to 13.9 yuan. 7,000 pieces of Shengji cake were traded, with spot prices of 13.1 to 13.3 yuan, and 13.3 to 13.35 yuan for delivery in the first half of July. Yuanlong cake was priced at 13 yuan. 3,000 pieces of Tongzhou Small Soybean Cake were priced at 20.05 yuan per 100 market catties.

Also, 400 cans of raw oil came from Yantai yesterday, and 250 cans came from Qingdao. As for export goods, there were 300 bags of soybeans transported to Hong Kong today.

### Sugar Market: Foreign Sugar Continues to Fall with Production Prices

Yesterday's sugar market saw a fall in Dutch production prices, continuing to drop by about 1 yuan. According to reports, the rough white price for the K.G.C.I.F example was 5.07 US dollars, and the Dutch red price for the same example was 4.12 US dollars. The association's divided spot price for 24 rough white in this warehouse was 67.8 yuan, down 1.2 yuan, and 67.34 to 67.5 yuan in foreign warehouses, down 0.6 yuan, and 52.8 to 53 yuan for re-export, down 1 yuan. The afternoon was slightly better, at 53.2 yuan. Taikoo Car White B Mark West Warehouse was 78 yuan, and East Warehouse was 77.5 yuan, down 1 yuan. DY Mark West Warehouse was 76 yuan, and Dutch red was 57 yuan, down 0.3 yuan. This snow white was 68 yuan, down 0.1 yuan, this No. 1 ice was 90.5 yuan, and Jingming ice was 92 yuan, both down 0.5 yuan. There were no transactions in domestic sugar.

Also, 300 bags of sugar came from Hong Kong yesterday.

### Dried and Preserved Goods: Fuhong Dates Are Available for Sale

100 bags of Jinan Fuhong dates arrived before, and were priced at 38 yuan, but no deal was made after holding for many days. It was heard yesterday that 50 bags had been opened for sale, with a price of 36 yuan in cash, up 1 yuan from before. The market is getting tighter, because the bottom is thin and still insisted on,

### Seafood: Western Sea Cucumber Sources Are Scarce; A Batch Was Sold Yesterday

The source of Western sea cucumber has been quiet recently, causing the bottom to gradually become thin. As for Chiyu ginseng, another batch was opened yesterday, and the number was small. The result was as follows: the opening price for Chiban was 219 yuan, No. 1 Chichi was 209 yuan, No. 2 Chichi was 193 yuan, No. 3 Chichi was 183 yuan, No. 4 Chichi was 174 yuan, No. 5 Chichi was 148 yuan, the opening price for Chuban jade was 375 yuan, No. 1 jade was 365 yuan, No. 2 was 345 yuan, No. 3 jade was 340 yuan, No. 4 jade was 330 yuan, and No. 5 jade was 396 yuan. The future is still considered firm and high.

### Hong Kong Gang Moves to Handle Dried Fish

The Hong Kong gang has been moving to handle dried fish recently, and because there is a lack of high-quality goods in the market, the selling price has continued to rise. Currently, the opening price is 120 yuan to 117 yuan, which is 135 yuan higher than the previous market. Secondly, Ningbo goods are still flat.

### Piece Goods: Stockpilers of Cotton Cloth Dump; Selling Prices Continue to Fall

Domestic Cloth: The market was still soft yesterday, and the selling price fell slightly. This was because the industry and stockpilers tended to sell, and the current sales volume was not large. The white goods, coarse and fine cloth, and twill continued to fall by 0.1 to 0.25 yuan per piece. The selling price of bleached and dyed cloth was even more chaotic. A part continued to fall by 0.25 to 0.5 yuan. About 200 pieces of coarse cloth, twill, and Luen Chang patterned goods were handled by the Zhoudong Wenyong gang. The wholesale number in this street traded 10,000 pieces of grey cloth, coarse cloth, poplin, western yarn, bleached cloth, and thread flannel. Purchasing from the guerrilla zones in Suzhou, Zhejiang, and Anhui continued uninterrupted, but there was a lack of wholesale transactions.

East Cloth: Because the standard gold continued to fall in the morning market, the selling pressure was even stronger, and fine cloth saw a new low price. The closing price of 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth fell to 27.6 yuan, gradually approaching the middle-grade brands. The sales of Four Gentlemen Serge Wood Street were still good, and the industry had a lot of buyers, so it only fell by 0.01 yuan, closing at 0.825 yuan.

Export: There were 15 pieces of piece goods transported to Hong Kong today, and 100 pieces transported to Yantai, and 50 pieces transported to Weihaiwei.

### High Price of Flannel Causes Sluggish Sales

The price of flannel has soared several times recently. First-quality British-made flannel is selling for thirty-six or thirty-seven yuan, second-quality for twenty-seven or twenty-eight yuan, and Renli domestic flannel for twenty-two yuan. White first-quality flannel has reached forty yuan and second-quality thirty-six or thirty-seven yuan, which can be considered the peak. Upon investigation, there have been no new arrivals or orders placed recently, and the market inventory is limited, so those holding goods are hoarding them. However, the actual sales volume has decreased by half compared to previous years due to the high prices. As a result, current transactions are mostly small and sporadic, with few whole batches being traded. Therefore, the standard lacks stability.

### Metals: Black Iron Billets Listless and Inactive

Recently, both local and foreign markets have shown little interest in black iron billets. The local thermos factories are experiencing extremely slow sales due to the hot weather, so they have little need for raw materials, including black iron billets. In addition, factories producing mirrors, printed goods, and cans are also buying less. The market is thus inactive. Furthermore, with the tense situation in Southeast Asia, overseas merchants are unlikely to be interested in purchasing. Merchants from Tianjin, Qingdao, and Yantai have also significantly reduced their buying due to the summer heat. Consequently, traders are offering more flexible prices, selling at around nine hundred and fifty yuan per piece. Today, one thousand five hundred pieces of tinplate were shipped to Tianjin.

### Silk and Tea: Raw Silk Plunges, Local Silk Transactions Sporadic

Yesterday, there was no market in New York due to Independence Day. Yokohama spot prices were one thousand three hundred and sixty yuan, down twenty yuan. Near-term prices were one thousand four hundred and thirteen yuan, down twenty-one yuan. Distant-term prices were one thousand four hundred and two yuan, down twenty-six yuan. Overseas silk prices seem to have shifted from stagnation to downward pressure.

Local foreign firms only had sporadic transactions, mostly restocking. Yesterday, ten bundles of 7-8 quality white factory silk were sold at four thousand five hundred yuan. Indian foreign firms' filature silk and reeled silk sold well yesterday. The market situation is generally similar to last month. Approximately seventy bundles were traded.

Yesterday, one thousand three hundred and twenty-seven chests of tea arrived from Hong Kong.

### June: New York Silk Sales Decline Sharply

The New York raw silk market in June saw a continued contraction in imports and sales. Compared to the same month last year, imports and sales were lower, and inventories increased sharply. Therefore, this year's silk prices have not risen as sharply as in previous years. On the contrary, the future of silk prices is bleak and unlikely to improve. June's raw silk imports decreased by four thousand seven hundred and forty bales compared to the previous month, sales decreased by one thousand six hundred and ninety bales, and inventories increased by one thousand four hundred and sixty-three bales.

Compared to the same month in previous years, imports decreased by five thousand four hundred and eighteen bales, about one-third, sales decreased by eight thousand nine hundred and thirty-nine bales, about one-half, and inventories increased by twenty-two thousand six hundred and thirteen bales, an increase of more than two hundred percent.

### Imports and Exports: Goods Arrive in Shanghai from Hong Kong

Recently, the following goods arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong: ten cases of rayon and three thousand five hundred and sixty chests of tea. Three hundred packages of tobacco arrived from Tianjin. Today, three hundred and thirty-five chests of tea and four bales of silk fabric are being shipped to Singapore.

### Gunfire Heard from Longhua Yesterday Morning: Explosions Shake Shanghai; Shelling Beginning at 4:30 AM Lasting Half an Hour; Loud Explosions Arouse Residents

Yesterday morning at 4:30 AM, intense machine gun fire and artillery explosions, interspersed with sporadic rifle shots, suddenly erupted near the South Station. Residents in both foreign concessions were startled awake and climbed onto rooftops or balconies to see what was happening, but they saw nothing. After about half an hour, it became quiet. The Central News Agency reporter inquired in various places. A senior official from the French police stated that he had not heard anything and knew nothing. A spokesman for the Japanese embassy said that he had not heard anything either and could not provide any information, but he denied that the gunfire was due to a conflict between Japanese troops and Chinese guerrillas. He said it could have been Japanese military exercises or the apprehension of thieves.

Japanese Side Claims Military Exercise

The English-language "China Press" reported that loud explosions, machine-gun fire, and rifle shots were heard from Longhua and western Shanghai from 5:00 AM to 7:00 AM this morning (the 5th), and were clearly audible. The Japanese authorities denied reports of guerrilla warfare in the area, claiming that the gunfire was due to Japanese military exercises in the Longhua area.

Residents Awakened, Details Unclear

According to a person who came from western Shanghai speaking to a reporter from the Dagong News Agency, the Japanese dispatched the "Naval Department" and the "Hai Xing Military Ship" to Shanghai, and transferred the "Peace and National Salvation Army" to be stationed in the suburbs of Shanghai. Recently, they have been building barracks, and the Japanese army sends a large number of military trucks every day to load bricks and stones in the South Station and Hongkou to transport them to build on their own, seemingly intending to stay for a long time. Large numbers of Chinese guerrilla troops have also arrived in Shanghai recently. Yesterday (the 5th) around 4:00 AM, intense machine gun fire suddenly erupted near Longhua in southern Shanghai, mixed with rifle shots, sometimes intense and sometimes sporadic, until it stopped at 5:15 AM. Residents in the city of South Station were all startled awake.

### "July 7th" Incident: Third Anniversary

Invisible Martial Law Tonight, Special Defense Tomorrow

China's long-term war of resistance against Japan has suddenly gone through three years of trials, and it has become increasingly firm, indomitable, and courageous. Tomorrow is the third anniversary of the Lugou Bridge Incident. In order to prevent accidents, the Shanghai Municipal Council's Police Department will implement invisible martial law starting tonight, and special precautions will be taken tomorrow. From 4:00 AM, iron wire barricades will be placed at various important locations, and all large and small hotels and public places suspected of harboring undesirable elements will be searched. All special Municipal Council police officers will be mobilized, and troops from various countries will also be deployed for emergency defense. The various precautions are the same as last year and include the mobilization of a portion of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps. According to a spokesman for the Shanghai Municipal Council, under these strict precautions, it is hoped that no unexpected incidents will occur.

### Shanghai-Vietnam Shipping Disrupted

Danish Cargo Ship Arrives in Shanghai

Shipping between Shanghai and Vietnam is limited to Jardine Matheson's "Tai Shan" which sailed to Haiphong on Thursday afternoon with 300 passengers. Whether it will reach its destination is unknown. If it cannot reach Haiphong, passengers may have to disembark in Hong Kong. Butterfield & Swire's "Sichuan", which normally has Haiphong as its destination, departed Shanghai yesterday but will only go as far as Hong Kong. Some smaller vessels continue to travel between Hong Kong and Annam. The Danish cargo ship "Afrika," which sailed from Copenhagen before Denmark surrendered to Germany, was detained by the British authorities in Colombo for nearly two months. It is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai this afternoon or tomorrow morning. Shipping industry sources announced yesterday that the ship flew the British flag after leaving Colombo, and it is likely that an agreement has been reached between the British naval authorities and the shipowner. The ship has no passengers and carries a large quantity of paper and other Danish products. After arriving in Shanghai, it will dock at the Wheelock & Co. Wharf.

### US Shipments of Medicines to China Blocked at Haiphong

American Advisory Committee Reports to Washington

The American Advisory Committee in Shanghai announced yesterday that a large shipment of medical supplies from the American Red Cross to aid Chinese civilians has been blocked in Haiphong. According to an official from the committee, the matter has been reported to Washington and is currently under investigation. The medical supplies were collected by the American Church Committee specifically for the relief of Chinese civilians.

### Shanghai's Daily Clearing of Bills Totals 10 Million Yuan

Evidence of Rampant Speculation

The dynamics of the bill market reflect the prosperity or decline of commerce and financial activity. Since the war, Shanghai has seen a concentration of funds and a rise in speculation, making the bill market very busy. The amount of bill clearing has also increased. According to reliable statistics, the amount of bill clearing in May and June of this year has reached 30 million yuan per month, an average of 10 million yuan per day. This surge in bill clearing reflects the abnormal state of Shanghai's commerce and the continued rampant speculation.

### Japanese Conduct Large-Scale Search in French Concession Yesterday; Two Chinese Arrested and Still in Custody for Investigation

At 6:00 AM yesterday, the Japanese suddenly dispatched more than a dozen plainclothes personnel in vehicles to the French Concession Police Station on Rue Cardinal Mercier, along with more than twenty Chinese and foreign detectives from the police department, who departed in batches to various destinations for searches. This action lasted a long time before it ended.

Two People Arrested

After much inquiry by reporters from the news agency, it was learned that the search involved multiple locations. The residence of an accountant at 355 Route Tenant de la Tour was searched, and he was arrested. The Zhonghui Bank on Avenue Edward VII was also searched. At the same time, the private residences of Xu Maotang, the bank manager, at Lane 116, No. 6 on Rue Amiral Courbet and No. 65 on Avenue Petain were also searched. As a result, Xu was also arrested.

Still in Custody

In addition, traffic was cut off for about two hours at the intersection of Avenue Petain and Route Albert, and the area around Route Massenet was also searched, but nothing was found. The two people arrested are still in custody, awaiting investigation. According to reports, the accountant has an office on Avenue Edward VII. Xu Maotang is from Ningbo and used to be a broker at the Cotton Cloth Exchange. He is now a shareholder and manager of Zhonghui Bank. According to a public announcement from the French police, yesterday morning (the 5th), the French police received a report that improper conduct had occurred at the Zhonghui Bank on Avenue Edward VII. After sending officers to investigate, two shareholders of the bank are now in the Central Police Station awaiting investigation.

Another Case

Also, it was reported that before the Japanese, along with French police officers, conducted the search and arrests in the French Concession yesterday morning, Mr. Xu Muxing was also kidnapped by someone on the 3rd of this month, and there is still no news of his release. This is the third time Xu Mu has disappeared.

Western Press Reports

The English-language "China Press" reported that the agreement established last week between the French and Japanese authorities in this city was implemented this morning (the 5th). Early this morning, several vehicles carrying Japanese troops arrived at the Zhaojia Bang Police Station on Rue Pichon and, after a brief wait, joined the French Concession police to conduct large-scale searches throughout the Concession. The well-known wealthy businessman Xu Maotang and an accountant were arrested and taken to Hongkou by the Japanese. The Zhonghui Bank building on Avenue Edward VII was also searched this morning by Japanese troops and French police. They also went to Xu Maotang's concubine's residence on Rue Amiral Courbet and then to Xu's residence on Avenue Petain to arrest Xu Maotang. The accountant was arrested at his residence on Route Tenant de la Tour.

### National Products Sales in Southeast Asia Affected; Deliberating on Solutions

Malaya Strengthens Foreign Exchange Controls

Overseas Chinese are very enthusiastic about using national products. According to statistics, there are more than 250 companies engaged in the national products business, of which silk and cotton fabrics are already restricted and are now becoming even more restricted. Large quantities of cotton textiles are being imported. Electrical appliances and light bulbs are subject to strict inspection upon import, and wires are not allowed to be imported. Leather goods are mainly suitcases. Cosmetics have also been continuously shipped for sale in recent years. Therefore, the current changes in the European situation and the tense situation in the Far East are extremely important for the export of Shanghai's entire national products industry. The national products industry in this city is currently deliberating on solutions to alleviate the dire situation. Since the outbreak of the European war last year, the British government of Malaya has controlled import and export foreign exchange based on the British wartime national defense financial regulations to consolidate the economy of Malaya. Subsequently, as the war expanded, the management of import and export foreign exchange has become increasingly strict, such as reducing the amount of remittances for household expenses by overseas Chinese from 500 Singapore dollars to 250 Singapore dollars. Foreign exchange controls have recently been tightened again. The notice to banks stipulates that: (1) Remittances to countries not in the sterling bloc are not allowed without the permission of the foreign exchange control officer. However, banks can continue to remit up to 250 yuan per transaction according to the needs of local businesses. However, all remittance approvals obtained before the publication of this notice that have not yet been remitted will be canceled. (2) Residents living abroad are not allowed to withdraw funds from their bank accounts within the colony, unless they obtain the permission of the foreign exchange control officer. The national products industry in this city has received these measures separately.

### Movements of British, American, and Italian Envoys: US Ambassador Johnson Decides to Postpone Visit; British Ambassador Remains in Shanghai; Italian Ambassador Traveled North Yesterday

According to the American Embassy yesterday, US Ambassador Johnson was originally scheduled to fly to Hong Kong on China National Aviation Corporation on July 4 after commemorating Independence Day in Chongqing. However, due to the repeated air raids on Chongqing, the ambassador has been caring for American expatriates and handling unfinished business.

### All Land Bureau Files Transferred to Jiangwan Yesterday; Departing Under Strict Shanghai Municipal Council Security; Property Rights Disputes Will Continue to Arise

The Shanghai Municipal Council, formally entrusted by the Chinese government to keep the Land Bureau files in custody, has finally disregarded the protests of the Chinese side and the revulsion of righteous people at home and abroad, and arbitrarily handed them over to a third party without legal status, and made a completely inappropriate "transfer" yesterday morning. At 8:55 AM yesterday morning, Sato, a senior consul from the Japanese Consulate General, accompanied by the pseudo "Land Bureau Director" Fan, official Chen, and pseudo "Municipal Government" representatives Yang and Wu, visited Shanghai Municipal Council Secretary General Fessenden, and then went to Room A506 of the Shanghai Municipal Council building (the secret location where the Land Bureau files were stored, the room had been walled off, and the walls had been removed by the Bureau beforehand), under the supervision of the Police Department's reserve team personnel, completing one of the most poignant chapters in the history of the Shanghai Land Bureau.

Shanghai Municipal Council's Official Announcement

According to the Shanghai Municipal Council's information office, the transfer of the former Land Bureau files through the Japanese Consul General was carried out by the Bureau this morning (the 5th). The transfer was completed by noon.

Recalling the Past, As If It Were Today

The "transfer" work began at 9:15 AM and was completed at 12:15 PM. When Shanghai Mayor Yu Hongjun entrusted these files to the Shanghai Municipal Council, they were transported by nineteen trucks, which took three nights, namely November 29 and 30 and December 1, 1937. Today, during the "transfer" of these files, more than a hundred police officers, led by Mr. Smith, guarded the Shanghai Municipal Council building, while Russian and Indian police officers were responsible for protecting the trucks. Only Sato from the special affairs team participated from the Japanese side. Journalists who went to take pictures were prohibited, but those who sneaked into higher parts of the Shanghai Municipal Council building were still able to take some shots.

Checking and Sending on Trucks

That morning, there were only more than a hundred police officers in the Shanghai Municipal Council building. In addition, there were 312 boxes of Land Bureau files piled on both sides. At 9:17 AM, Mr. Duncan, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Public Utilities Department, opened the locks on the 312 iron cages. After both parties inspected the seals and stamps on the wooden boxes, they were continuously moved out of the security room and onto the trucks scheduled outside, beginning their fate of falling into enemy hands. When the transport began, police officers, Russian police, and Indian police all stood guard around the area.

Strict Protection, Driving Away One After Another

At 10:15 AM, all the wooden boxes were loaded, and then the reserve team's red cross police cars escorted them away from the Shanghai Municipal Council building. At the same time, a team of armed Indian police and several Japanese military police guarded the trucks. The convoy drove north along the Bund, across the Garden Bridge to the Huangpu Road intersection, where they were replaced by pseudo-"Municipal Government Police," and the Japanese consulate authorities re-examined them. Then, each truck continued to proceed to the city center. Thus, all the Land Bureau files fell into the hands of the puppet regime.

Future Disputes Just Beginning

These files include all land deeds inside and outside the current jurisdiction. Just after 9:15 AM yesterday morning, these files were transported out of the Shanghai Municipal Council, and the transportation was completed at 12:15 PM in the afternoon. The property rights of all Chinese and foreign people will be greatly affected by this move by the Shanghai Municipal Council, especially the Chinese property owners, because Chinese property owners will be forced to be controlled by the puppet regime. According to rumors from outside, after the pseudo "Municipal Government" gets these files, because most property owners support the Chongqing Central Government, it may take retaliatory measures to threaten them and "confiscate" their properties when necessary. However, some Chinese property owners have reportedly transferred their property rights to foreigners, but this change of history has not been registered in the files. From this, it can be seen that complex and chaotic disputes are just beginning.

American Consul Did Not Agree

The Shanghai Land Bureau files, which Mayor Yu Hongjun deposited with the Shanghai Municipal Council through formal procedures, were transferred by the Shanghai Municipal Council to Japanese Consul General Miura yesterday. The Japanese puppet regime began demanding the transfer of these files in May of last year. The Shanghai Municipal Council has always believed that this is property entrusted by the Chinese government and could not be handed over to a third party, which was greatly appreciated by people at home and abroad. However, it suddenly abandoned its original position and handed it over, which has already been implemented. People want to know how it happened. According to the Japanese "Continental News," this was the result of the mediation of the Italian Consul General. The newspaper said that after the "Municipal Government" made a strong demand to the consular corps for the transfer of the Land Bureau files, Shanghai Municipal Council Director Gangben Ichisaku ran around lobbying the Western directors. The Italian Consul General also asked the consular corps to discuss how to respond to the handover. Although the American Consul General was unwilling to agree to the handover, the Italian Consul General mediated between the Shanghai Municipal Council and the Japanese side, and the method of transferring the files to Consul General Miura for receipt was adopted.

### Important News Compilation

The Ningbo Shaoxing Disaster Relief Committee of the Shaoshao Public Relief Committee is scheduled to hold the second fundraising conference at 4:00 PM on the afternoon of the 14th of this month at the Shaoxing Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association Hall, No. 330 Avenue Edward VII, Public Concession. At that time, they will actively discuss raising 3 million yuan in donations for grain price stabilization as soon as possible to relieve the urgent needs of their fellow villagers. According to the person in charge of the association, since the first fundraising conference, they have received a total of more than 200,000 yuan in donations as of yesterday, and 120,000 yuan has been withdrawn to purchase 1,000 bags of foreign rice and transport them to Shaoxing for assistance. Also, the rumor that Jiangxi rice can be transported to Shaoxing for assistance is not true, because in these extraordinary times, each province must be self-sufficient in grain. Therefore, the rice shortage in Shaoxing is still very serious. The Ningbo grain price stabilization donation fundraising conference is also scheduled to be held for the third time this afternoon at 4:00 PM at the Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association Hall on Rue Yu Ya Ching. The Polish Disaster Relief Committee's drama performance at the Lyceum Theatre on March 27th raised donations, and after expenses, there was a net surplus of 8,978 yuan and 29 cents.

Japanese Shipwreck According to reliable information from the shipping industry, a Japanese ship, "Irabu Maru," wrecked and sank near Irabu Island, Miyako District, Okinawa Prefecture, at 5:00 PM on the 30th of last month. Of the 150 passengers, only 30 were rescued. Sixty-six bodies have been found, and the whereabouts of the others are still unknown.

Guangzhou Parcels The Parcel Division of the Postal Administration has notified that, due to slight changes in the situation, a list of post offices under the jurisdiction of the Guangzhou Bureau (i.e., the post offices in the occupied areas, including Shantou and Haikou) that have recently been revised and suspended from accepting parcels or small packages will be announced for public knowledge.

### Sanitation Problems After Refugee Area Closure

After the South Station refugee area closed at the end of last month, the living conditions of the more than 19,000 refugees who have stopped receiving food rations are still of concern to all sectors of society. According to what the reporter has learned, of the 88 shelters in the area, only 6 have been ordered to relocate, and the others can still live there peacefully. However, since the area office was withdrawn and the cleaning work in the area was stopped, dirt has accumulated, and at the same time, it is the hot summer season, and the number of refugee diseases is gradually increasing. Now, Xin Puyu Hall and the First Hospital in the area are planning to expand their medical treatment and medicine distribution, and they still hope that charitable people will provide assistance.

### Hong Kong Evacuates Women and Children; Japanese Emotionally Agitated; Calling it Bizarre and Unfriendly; Various Speculations on Demands on Hong Kong and Burma

Reuters from Tokyo on the 4th reported that the three Japanese ministries of the Army, Navy, and Foreign Affairs all said they had no formal comment on Hong Kong's evacuation of women and children, but reiterated that they did not understand the reason for it. All they knew about the evacuation was from reading the newspapers. An army spokesman considered the evacuation a bizarre action, saying that the Japanese army had not occupied Hong Kong.

British Territory

While committed to revising wartime supplies to Chongqing, they had no intention of crossing the border at this time. One view is that there is no reason for panic in Hong Kong. Some quarters regard the evacuation of women and children as an unfriendly gesture, intended to incite the United States to take definite action in the Far East. The British government's request to the Japanese side to stop wartime supplies being transported to Chongqing via Hong Kong and Burma.

Slow to Reply

This has caused considerable dissatisfaction in various quarters here. This is further evidence of Britain's attempt to draw the United States into Anglo-Japanese incidents. Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman Sama said that he believed Britain had no reason to consult with the United States. According to general opinion, Japanese people who do not want Anglo-Japanese relations to continue to deteriorate hope that Britain will comply with Japan's demands, and say that Britain

Pro-Chongqing Policy

Will strengthen Japan's pro-German sentiments. Well-informed sources expect a surprising reaction in the Far East if the British government rejects Japan's demands. Japan is currently patiently awaiting the British reply. The Japanese Embassy in Tokyo, because it could not foresee what the British would answer, refused to make any critical remarks.

### Yesterday's Visit by the French Consul-General and Others to Disinfect Rickshaws

The Hygiene Department of the French Municipal Council and the Vehicle Department of the French Concession Police, in view of the arrival of summer and the fact that rickshaws are one of the mediums for transmitting infectious diseases, have been conducting rickshaw disinfection in the French Concession at 350 Avenue Haig since the 25th of last month. According to an interview by a reporter from the Pingming News Agency, there are a total of 5,400 rickshaws in the French Concession, of which 2,500 have been disinfected as of yesterday. The disinfection takes place once every three weeks, with 220 rickshaws disinfected each time. Each rickshaw puller sends their rickshaw for disinfection at 11:00 PM and picks it up at 5:00 AM the next morning. Yesterday at 7:00 PM, to accommodate visits from various sectors, the disinfection was conducted earlier. Those who attended yesterday included French Consul-General Eugène, the Director-General of the French Municipal Council, the Head of the Political Affairs Department of the French Concession Police, Walter, and more than a dozen others. A demonstration was given to the public. All the vehicles to be disinfected were stored in an airtight chamber, which contained sulfur and other disinfectant chemicals. The disinfection time was five hours. According to the person in charge, after the vehicles are disinfected, the authorities issue a disinfection certificate, which is required for passage within the concession. Furthermore, rickshaw pullers receive free preventative injections, free bathing, and free cleaning of clothes every morning.

### Establishment of the Rice Price Evaluation Committee; Rice Prices to Be Evaluated Starting Yesterday; Evaluations to Be Conducted Twice Weekly, Every Other Day; Over 80,000 Bags of Foreign Rice Have Arrived This Week

Although the situation in Hong Kong and Vietnam has been tense recently, the arrival of foreign rice in Shanghai continues unabated. One day, the Zeni Kana Maru mail ship of the Java Company arrived from Hong Kong with more than 16,000 bags; on the 2nd, the Taesheng Wheel of Jardine Matheson arrived from Haiphong with 650 bags and from Hong Kong with 17,051 bags; on the 3rd, the Yongsheng Wheel of Jardine Matheson transported 11,502 bags from Hong Kong. Yesterday (the 5th), the Suiyang Wheel of Butterfield & Swire transported 19,239 bags from Hong Kong, and the Taiyuan Wheel transported 20,430 bags from Hong Kong and is currently unloading.

Rice Arrivals Excessive, Yet Prices Rise

The above-mentioned information has been repeatedly recorded in the commercial news column of this newspaper. Up to yesterday this week, a total of 84,872 bags of foreign rice have arrived, which, according to daily usage calculations, must have a surplus. However, the rice prices in the city are rising step by step, which clearly indicates the malpractice of speculation and price gouging.

Establishment of the Evaluation Committee

The Shanghai Rice Price Evaluation Committee held its inaugural meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday at the Doumi Industry Association Hall at 15 Avenue Edward VII. Zhang Yingmei from the Public Works Department of the International Settlement, Xie Xuefang from the French Municipal Council, Zhao Zhiyou from the French Concession Evaluation Committee, Zhong Jinchen from the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, and all members of the committee were present. Chen Ziyi was publicly elected as the temporary chairman. First, the chairman reported on the purpose of the meeting, followed by a congratulatory speech from Zhao Zhiyou, the representative of the French Concession Evaluation Committee (speech omitted).

If ships are lacking, the authorities of the two concessions will be requested to assist; (5) Zhao Zhiyou proposed that financial circles be requested to undertake foreign rice mortgage loans to increase the amount of stored rice. The resolution was unanimously approved, and the committee will send letters to the authorities of the two concessions and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to forward the request to financial circles for assistance. The following is a general record of the Shanghai Rice Price Evaluation Committee.

The regulations are as follows: (1) This committee is organized by various rice industry groups in accordance with the intentions of the Shanghai Concession authorities, and the authorities of the two concessions and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce are invited to participate and provide guidance. It is named the Shanghai Rice Price Evaluation Committee.

If there are any black market activities, once discovered, they should be reported to the authorities of the two concessions for severe punishment. (6) The address of this committee is temporarily located at the Doumi Industry Association Hall at 15 Avenue Edward VII.

Tribute Rice Price Lower Than Shanghai by Six Yuan

The Shanghai People's Food Adjustment Association orders foreign rice to adjust people's food supply, and has always entrusted British firms such as He Yi to purchase on its behalf. However, in order to save commissions, the association has agreed with Saigon that it can directly order rice from Saigon by telegram. According to Mr. Miao Huanxiang of the association, the price of foreign rice purchased by the association is about six yuan lower per bag than that sold on the market. Therefore, various factories in Shanghai have been actively entrusting the association to order foreign rice.

### Lover's Quarrel Leads to Murder; Perpetrator Sentenced to Life Imprisonment

Chai Xiyan, a 31-year-old native of Yuyao who lives on the third floor of No. 12, Lane 263, Yangshupu Road, works as a cook. Because he resented his fellow townsman Zhou Jiayin, who lived in the pavilion room of the same building, for committing adultery with his concubine Wu Gu-shi, he bought a cleaver at around 5:00 PM on the 24th of last month. Upon returning home, without asking questions, he hacked Zhou Jiayin to death with random blows. Wu Gu-shi screamed for help, and her right wrist was also slashed. Neighbors broke down the door and handed Chai over to the police, who sent him to the First Special Court, where he was prosecuted under Article 271 of the Criminal Law for premeditated murder. Judge Jiang interrogated him and remanded him in custody for a later hearing. The hearing continued yesterday morning. The defendant admitted that because the deceased committed adultery with his mistress Wu Gu-shi, he was unwilling to accept it, so he bought a knife and committed the crime. The court ordered lawyer Zhang Tianyin of the police and the appointed defense lawyer to debate with each other, and then announced the end of the trial. The court sentenced Chai Xiyan to life imprisonment, deprived him of his civil rights for life, and confiscated the murder weapon.

### Thugs Use Hand Grenade to Attack Trolley Bus; Explosion on the Spot Injures Many

Trolley bus No. 384 on Route 16, operated by the Public Bus Company of the International Settlement and running from Caojiadu to Sanyangjing Bridge in West Shanghai, was driven by driver No. 137. At 7:50 PM last night, as it departed from Caojiadu and stopped at the intersection of Mackinnon Road and Changping Road, a thug suddenly threw a hand grenade into the third-class carriage window for unknown reasons. Because the throw was very forceful, the hand grenade exploded in the car, with a loud bang that resounded far and wide. Thick smoke filled the air, and shrapnel flew everywhere. Passengers in the car were unable to avoid it, and five passengers and ticket seller No. 175 were injured by the shrapnel. The body of the bus and the glass windows were also severely damaged. The uninjured passengers got off the bus and fled for their lives. Later, the Chinese police arrived after hearing the sound, but the thug who threw the grenade had already escaped without a trace. An ambulance was quickly summoned to send the six injured to Baolong Hospital and the Red Cross Hospital for treatment. It is heard that two pedestrians on the side of the road were also injured by the shrapnel, but the injuries were very minor and they hired a car to go to the hospital for treatment.

### Arrested for Using Counterfeit Money; The Offender Had Been Sentenced to Imprisonment and Released on Parole; After Investigation, the Order Was Issued to Reschedule for Further Verification

Lin Huixin from Anhui Province, 32 years old, came to Shanghai from Nanjing one week ago and lodged with a friend at No. 128, Avenue du Roi Albert. Because he was unemployed and poor, he purchased 165 counterfeit banknotes of the Central Bank, all five-yuan notes, totaling 825 yuan, from Ye Huadong for 60 yuan.

Using These Counterfeit Banknotes

On the afternoon of the 2nd of this month, at 5:00 PM, he went to the Feishun Leather Shoe Store opened by Shen Jinsong, a local, at No. 217, Avenue du Roi Albert, to buy two pairs of yellow and white leather shoes, priced at 50 yuan. He first paid Shen with real money, then falsely claimed that he needed to go elsewhere to shop, and asked Sun to return the real money, intending to pay a ten-yuan deposit so that he could pay the shoe price and pick up the goods after returning from shopping. Shen did not allow his request. Lin still took out the same counterfeit banknote from his bag and paid Shen, and took the shoes.

Calmly Left

Shen did not suspect anything at the time because he had already counted the money. It was not until he checked the money in the evening that he realized it was counterfeit. He immediately notified his younger brother, Shen Jinlin, who opened the Jiabu Leather Shoe Store at No. 66, Avenue Joffre, to pay attention. Unexpectedly, Lin was caught in the net of justice. On the afternoon of the 4th, at 2:00 PM, he went to the Jiabu Leather Shoe Store to use the same trick and was discovered by Shen Jinlin, who reported it to Detective No. 196, who arrested Lin and confiscated ten counterfeit and real banknotes each, and

Searched Out Counterfeit Banknotes

155 banknotes, and brought them to the police station together and sent them to the Criminal Court No. 1 of the Second Special Court. Police lawyer Fei Xizhen requested an extension on the grounds that the police department had not completed the investigation. When questioned, the defendant confessed that he had been working in the military and had come to Shanghai from Nanjing one week ago. Because he was unfamiliar with the place and had difficulty making a living, he resorted to this trick. He also admitted that he had been sentenced to seven years of imprisonment by the court in 1932 and had been released on parole during the war in 1937, but he had already

Served Six Years in Prison

Judge Sun Penghao ordered a rescheduling for further interrogation on the 15th because the police had not yet filed charges. The ten five-yuan real banknotes that were confiscated were returned to the plaintiff Shen Jinsong as compensation for the shoe price. Shen signed for them in court. The 155 counterfeit banknotes that were confiscated were ordered to be stored in the treasury for confiscation.

### Poem on a Chaste Woman

The chaste woman, surnamed Liu, is from Dagang, Binhu. Her given name is Jiayin. She was betrothed to Zhu Zongfu, a student, but Zhu's family was poor, and he died of illness before they could marry. When the chaste woman heard the news, she vowed to go to his house and remain chaste. She wore plain clothes and went there weeping, and hundreds of people in the village watched, all shedding tears for her. I write this poem to commemorate her!

(1) Meng Guang's talent and virtue surpassed the ordinary; she was willing to marry Liang Hong and did not despise poverty; unfortunately, "Peach Blossoms" had not yet been recited, and the song of parting left new tear stains. (2) It was reported that her good man was ill and resting; she burned incense and prayed to the heavens first; who knew that the allotted time was difficult to reverse, and cutting flesh to prepare medicine soup was in vain. (3) Hearing the news, she hurriedly drove the boat here, removing her bracelets and earrings and tailoring a ramie skirt; Gong Jiang had long ago set her will on the cypress boat, and there was no need for others to persuade her a hundred times. (4) Before marrying, she wanted to go, following her husband and not betraying her pure heart; after entering the door and paying respects to her parents-in-law, she knelt before the spirit tablet, shedding tears. (5) Thinking of sacrificing her body for her husband, all she heard was weeping all day long; not just once did she try to drown or hang herself, and she stopped eating for days, causing more sorrow. (6) Her husband's family had always had a literary fragrance, and they frequently discussed continuing the lineage; there were few uncles and brothers, and the family was pitifully desolate. (7) She was unwilling to rely on her mother's family, and was willing to guard a poor family and keep her jade pure; she had no regrets about eating coarse tea and drinking medicine, and her fierce nature and firm integrity were commendable. (8) An old aunt still exists with white hair, and she tries her best to serve her and make her happy; her great integrity and great chastity will never be extinguished, and it is especially appropriate that she be honored with a memorial archway in the future.

### Vitamin K

— Mo Ming

Several older brothers among vitamins: A, B, C... everyone is already very familiar with them. Now I am going to introduce one of their younger brothers—K.

Although this younger brother is still very young, he is "developing" unusually quickly. Since 1925, when Dr. Henrik Dam of Denmark first discovered this substance in food that can prevent bleeding disorders in animals, scientists around the world have been working on it, and new discoveries have emerged one after another. Until last year, his chemical structural formula and artificial synthesis methods were successively successfully researched, and this year even artificial products have appeared on the market. In just five years, almost all problems have been solved, which can truly be said to be a representative work of modern science's high-speed progress.

Vitamin K is named "antihemorrhagic vitamin": animals will suffer from a bleeding disorder if they lack it in their bodies. Bleeding is something that everyone has experienced. Usually, the blood will naturally clot to seal the wound, but when suffering from a bleeding disorder, the blood loses its original clotting ability, resulting in continuous bleeding and a serious situation. Originally, the blood clotting effect is not a simple phenomenon. When our body sends out an emergency bleeding signal, many "firefighters" that are normally present in the blood immediately mobilize to rush to the scene of the accident to carry out rescue work. According to physiologists, the personnel participating in the rescue at the time include: "fibrinogen," "thrombin," "prothrombin," "thrombokinase," and "platelets"; their action procedure is as follows: platelets rupture themselves, releasing large quantities of thrombokinase, which combine with prothrombin to generate thrombin, and thrombin then combines with fibrinogen to form fibrin protein. These many fibers can be linked together to form a tight network that fills the bleeding gap, and then the great task of clotting is declared complete. As for vitamin K, it is also an important participant in this campaign. Its task has not been fully clarified yet, but if it is not present, prothrombin cannot be produced, rescue work cannot proceed, and the blood will never be able to clot. The physiological function of the human body is so magical that it is truly amazing; if we compare the human body to a precise and complex machine, then vitamin K is a very small gear in it. Although the thing is insignificant, its relationship to the entire organization is not insignificant.

Foods containing vitamin K include alfalfa, spinach, tomatoes, milk, etc.: also, because it is a fat-soluble substance, various vegetable oils also contain a little bit. I would like to introduce alfalfa (also known as grass seeds, similar to golden flower vegetables, but with purple flowers). This is a plant rich in various vitamins and other nutrients, with low prices and good quality. It is worth promoting. Those who pay attention to food and nutrition should not miss it.

### In the Park

— Xu Yi

Days roll by, and in the blink of an eye, it's another scorching summer.

Facing the noisy street, unable to catch a breath, I followed the leisurely crowd into the park on a whim.

In the park, the flowers, not yet withered with the passing of spring, hung their heads. People squatting in the flowerbeds happily accepted their greetings and smiled with joy.

Thus, laughter filled the entire park, and the leaves of all the trees hummed a soft tune. In the tune, in the laughter, lay the aspirations of the joyful people, entrusting a philosophy of life that treats the world as a mere inn.

Suddenly, the laughter disappeared, vanishing between the flowers and leaves, fading from the ears of the traveler—my heart felt heavy.

A child harboring homesickness is sorrowful. Facing the flowers, the flowers bled crimson; facing the leaves, the leaves sobbed faintly; facing the people, the laughter of the people held ten thousand shames; facing the sky, the sky turned grim, scolding the unpromising child who had lost his home.

Clutching my own heart, I felt even more breathless than in the bustling city; powerlessly gazing around, the people around me laughed, how vigorously they laughed!

"The park is not fit for lonely young people to enjoy; only the wilderness belongs to the children of the earth! The park is merely an adornment for the city dwellers."

I sighed and stepped out of the park gate, gasping for air.

Book Review

### Growth of a Great Era

— Jingwei

We are facing a great era head-on. It is this era that inspires us, encourages us to strive, and plants new life within our resolute confidence! However, this era has its past, its growth, and has undergone much hardship and peril, especially in the transition from chaos to unity, from centrifugal to centripetal forces. Here, we must not forget the ideological shift of the youth, which propelled the growth of this great era.

Mr. Qi Tong's "New Generation" trilogy aims to reflect this chain reaction. It is not merely a novel but a living history book. Although we can currently only see the first part, "December 9th," it already depicts the ideological path of the youth in North China, unfolding a heroic and resolute scene! As the author says in the introduction: "But its content is vast, ever-changing, and profound."

In this "December 9th," the author focuses on writing about people, about the ideological transformation of the youth. Each of them has shortcomings and advantages; some advance, some lag behind, and some even betray the cause. However, behind the activities of these young people, the inherent progress of humanity is revealed. There are cruel conspiracies hatched by political corruption and the claws of evil forces operating in the shadows. But from "December 9th" to "December 16th" and the winter vacation work in the countryside, from planning to demonstrations and sabotage to deeper involvement with the people, the growth of new characters is portrayed throughout. How they gradually transformed from bookworms and onlookers into revolutionaries, how they shed the habits of privileged youth and embarked on the arduous and challenging path of struggle!

Of course, it's not all a heroic scene here. The author uses a critical pen to depict the superficiality and disorganization of mass struggles, which serves as a powerful lesson. Thus, there is rebirth and sacrifice, resolution and wavering. Yet "December 9th" is like a bomb that awakens the youth and people of the entire nation. Although this struggle was not enough to prevent the shameful weakness of diplomacy, it has awakened the sleeping lion! As the female protagonist Wei Ling says: "But it doesn't matter; this is a seed! Don't forget, it can produce many new ones. Look, the spring breeze has already stirred!..."

From this, although there is still room for improvement and refinement in the writing techniques of the "New Generation," it is a novel worth reading and should be read, especially by the youth trapped in the isolated island who feel frustrated. They should draw excitement and clarity from this (especially from the few illustrations), because here you see your own shadow, the shadow of the entire new generation! (New Generation, written by Qi Tong, published by Life Bookstore)

### Man and Money

— Translated by Jingzheng

Those who chase money are "money grubbers"; those who hoard money are capitalists; those who waste money are playboys; those who can't get money are useless people; those who don't want to get money lack ambition; those who get money without working are parasites. If he spends his whole life working to accumulate money, people will say he is a fool without any meaning in life. Vic Oliver

Hawthorne Detective Cases

### The Homecoming of the Dance Queen

— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter 3: Conflicting Information

At this moment, a burst of noise suddenly arose outside the door—the sound of a car, voices, and leather shoes—abruptly interrupting Jinmei's speech. Hawthorne and Ni Jinshou also stood up from the cushioned chairs. I felt that the air in the room had suddenly become tense.

A minute later, the source of the noise outside the door was clarified. It turned out that the police hearse from the police station had arrived. Ni Jinshou pocketed his notebook and rushed ahead of Hawthorne to make contact. Before long, a uniformed police officer, leading four white-clad porters carrying a narrow stretcher, followed Ni Jinshou into the reception room. This police officer was called Qin Mozhai, who had a comical face suitable for the camera, and we were already acquainted with him.

He greeted us with a smile and said, "Mr. Hawthorne, have you found any clues yet?"

Hawthorne shook his head slightly. "It's still early."

"I believe that once you cast your discerning eye upon it, any secret will be revealed. I'm not flattering you, the murderer will definitely not escape." Qin Mozhai grinned at Hawthorne.

Hawthorne replied awkwardly, "Chief Qin, don't joke around. You make a living from the law; your eyes are the discerning ones. I can't be sure whether the murderer will escape or not. This matter is too complicated."

"Don't be modest; you'll always find a way."

"Really, my work must begin after your work is completed."

"What does that mean?"

Hawthorne stopped answering and took out his cigarette case from his pocket again.

Ni Jinshou said, "Chief Qin, don't get angry. Hurry up and take the body out. We still have to ask questions." He cast a glance at Jinmei, who was standing in front of the dressing table mirror.

### City

— Lei Xing

I stand before the window of a high-rise, overlooking this urban landscape. The scene of the city resembles the clumsy strokes of an unskilled painter: so chaotic. But my imagination lingers on the past.

At that time, this place was just a fishing village with a few families, desolate and deserted; a cry sent into the distance would be suspected as the embodiment of terror.

Afterwards, it grew up under blood and tears and the "civilized" cannons of humiliation.

The noise of the streets interrupts the path of my imagination. Returning to reality, I must ask: City, where are you going next? With the smoke of war covering the sky and the world in turmoil, how many good days do you have left? In this era, in these times, who can maintain that fortune forever?

Now is the age of reckoning. City, how many sins have you conceived? You are digging your own grave with your own hands.

Moreover, the cannons will eventually return.

### About Edward G. Robinson

— Qinghui

Edward G. Robinson, who recently played the lead role in "Dr. Ehrlich's Magic Bullet," used to have his roles always confined to the realm of violent personalities; but this time, he broke out of that mold and played a kind-hearted, compassionate doctor, and he was still appropriate and convincing in every way. Indeed, Robinson is a talented actor.

The Miracle of Success: When Robinson was studying at school, whenever he had free time, he would always carry an old wooden box, stand among the crowds on the street, and give speeches. He later told others that these speeches greatly helped him in his acting on the screen later, because he often gave speeches, he became experienced, and when he acted, he felt at ease.

Loves Children: Robinson's sense of life is mostly concentrated in his family, art, books, friends, and his beloved son, Manny. He often mentioned Manny in conversation, and the first thing he did when he got home from work was to caress his son, and sometimes recite a few poems to him. A group of friends were always happy and interesting in his home, and would often propose a topic for mutual debate. He also liked to go to plays or concerts and lectures, and often hosted banquets.

Strong Personality: Once, he taught Manny, "A person in society must respect others. Most importantly, one should know that everyone has his own dignity. If one has done something wrong, one naturally deserves it; but if it is not due to one's own fault, but due to the interference of others, then, for the sake of justice, one must stand up and fight to maintain one's own dignity." From this passage, Robinson's personality can be imagined, and it seems that he also wants to pass this strong personality on to his son!

Pipe King: Robinson is Hollywood's famous "Pipe King." He has a special fondness for pipes. He feels that each type of pipe can represent a person's personality. For example: those who are irritable or those who are thoughtful. By looking at his pipe, one can imagine it. He once collected one hundred and nine types of pipes, each with a different form, not only elegant and beautiful, but also antique. When filming, he likes to use a small pipe, because he can put it in his pocket at will during breaks.

"The Man They Could Not Hang" is the most terrifying blockbuster of the season, co-starring Karloff and Lorre. The whole film is full of thrills and horror and is indeed the only sweat reliever for the summer. Now showing at the Nanjing Grand Theatre.

### Tan Fuying's First Night on Stage

— Wei Wo

The day after Ma Lianliang stopped performing, Tan Fuying, who is as famous as Ma and one of the three great beards of the Beijing Chao school, took the stage at the Updating Stage. The reporter went to watch on time and recorded it as follows:

"When I arrived at the theater, the stage was performing 'A Happy Marriage.' Ji Yanfen (that is, Xiao Guihua) is old and faded, and her makeup is not good. Playing a Hua Dan play, she seems to have lost her class, but when she appears, someone applauds. On this day, Yanfen was on stilts, and her stilt skills are still not weak, but there is nothing else worth mentioning. Jiang Miaoxiang's Lu Kunjie only performed one scene of 'Teaching', which lasted only ten minutes. Then Yang Shengchun's 'Picking the Chariot,' with Han Shengxin playing Yuan Shu. Tan Shiying was not seen on stage. Yang Shengchun had not been seen for three years and has made a lot of progress. The play 'Picking the Chariot' was originally Shengchun's masterpiece, and this evening was the first performance, so he put in a lot of effort. Therefore, this play was like wildfire, and his fight with Zhang Lianting below the stage showed even more skill. Unfortunately, his voice is still weak, so the long 'Pomegranate Flower' song is difficult to satisfy people's expectations. This is the only regret; if Shengchun has a day when his voice is clear, then it will not be difficult to grasp the leadership of the Wusheng of today." The final act was Chen Lifang's "Female Escort." Lifang is one who strives to learn Yanqiu, and people say that Lifang can only learn Cheng's shortness and cannot take Cheng's length. But watching her perform the Escort, she has things worth praising. That is, her singing and recitation and enunciation are as attentive to yin and yang and level tones as Yanqiu's, such as the word "deliver" in the flowing water "Deliver the letter to my third brother," such as the word "spring" in "I do not know the spring in prison," are all good; only Yanqiu's singing, the bass shows quite a bit of effort, and every time it pleases in the bass, Lifang's bass is not enough, which is her shortcoming.

The supporting role of Chong Gongdao, Xiao Shoushan, is stable and flawless, which is rare. The finale was Tan Fuying's entire "Empty City Strategy." The four introductory lines when he appeared on stage, the last sentence was quite forceful, but he still felt timid, and seemed unable to give full play to it; in the original allegro, the first sentence, "The two countries are at odds, dragons and tigers fight," was full of meaning and got a full applause. The tune used in the fourth sentence, "Wu wants freedom," is the same as that sung by Shuyan. Later in the allegro, the sentence "Han Zhuge supports the young lord," the tune of the three words "supports the young lord" is also the same as that sung by Shuyan. Looking at Fuying's play as a whole, there are many places in the singing where he learns from Shuyan. I have never seen Tan Xinpei, but judging by his intentions, Fuying's play must be secretly learning from Shuyan. Losing the Street Pavilion, the scene of looking at the map is excellent; reciting the second "captured" in "captured", the sound is turned high, and it sounds quite pleasant, followed by singing the allegro "Little Ma Su lost the Street Pavilion, which is hateful," the third sentence "Old soldiers, why are you discussing," the four words "discussing" should have a good tune, Fuying failed to use it well. The last two sentences "Tell the old soldiers to sweep the streets and hold on to the peace of mind," "Rely on this Qin to protect the empty city," Fuying suddenly came on, "hold on to the peace of mind," made a long tune, and turned it high to sing, getting a full applause. The ending of the four words "rely on this Qin" is also quite wonderful. The city tower scene is the lifeblood of the entire play. On this evening, Fuying only sang six and a half tunes, and his voice was not very pleasant. The first sentence of the slow allegro "I am originally," although it got applause, seemed not as good as the second sentence. In the next section, the second and sixth allegro "I am watching the mountain scenery on the city tower," because I had something to do, I didn't have time to listen to the difference, so I left my seat and went elsewhere, so I didn't get to see the final scene of beheading Su. As for the supporting roles, Wang Quankui's Sima Yi was still competent, and Ha Bao Shan's Wang Ping was excellent. Bao Shan has a stage posture, which is wonderful. Ye Shengmao's Ma Su has shallow skill and is not as thoughtful as Quankui. But he has made a lot of progress compared to his last visit to Shanghai. Ci Ruiquan is old and strong, but in this play, he plays the old soldier reporting the news and failed to show his strengths.
