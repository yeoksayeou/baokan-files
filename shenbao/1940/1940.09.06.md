### U.S. Note to Japan: Close Attention to New Situation in the Far East; Possible Joint Front for British and American Navies; Japanese Government to Issue Formal Statement on Vietnam Situation

Washington: The United States yesterday publicly notified Japan that Washington will pay close attention to all Japanese actions in the Far East that could affect Annam and the East Indies. At the same time, Secretary of State Hull revealed that the United States still refuses to recognize the Japanese takeover of the British defense zone in Shanghai (i.e., the one evacuated by British forces last month). Hull said that U.S.-Japan negotiations on the aforementioned issue are still ongoing, but have not yet reached the point of any agreement. It is reported that Hull warned Japan earlier this summer, stating that the United States opposes any attempts to change the situation in the Far East by force. According to unconfirmed reports from here yesterday, Japan's request to transport troops through Annam territory was rejected. It is said that Japan has notified the French authorities in Annam that Japanese troops will arrive in the French colony early tomorrow. As for what action the United States will take if the integrity of Annam's territory is violated by Japanese forces, Hull did not say. Hull issued a statement saying that the situation in French Annam "is an event that the US government is paying attention to." The US has not confirmed the reports that Japan sent an ultimatum to the French authorities in Annam, and fundamentally considers the report to be unbelievable. The statement continued that if future events prove that the aforementioned report is not without basis, the impact on American public opinion will be unimaginable." (Fifth, United Press Dispatch)

Tokyo: Asahi Shimbun today published an editorial speculating that the British and American navies may take a common front against Japan. The article stated that if Germany wins the war against Britain, the British fleet will inevitably withdraw from the domestic waters, and the situation in the Far East will be affected. Yomiuri Shimbun stated that Britain urgently needs any assistance it can get to resist the German offensive, so it is well aware that the American destroyers are already old, but it is still willing to lower its dignity before the United States. These fifty destroyers are part of the two hundred ships that the United States hurriedly built during the last World War, of which 30% are no longer seaworthy. A few years ago, Congress investigated this matter. Britain's move is indeed strange, but Britain's purpose goes far beyond obtaining these destroyers. Its purpose is to gradually pull the United States closer to war, and to shock its enemies spiritually, and to encourage and excite its own people. How Britain and the United States can continue to do this is none of our business, but the possibility of the compromise between Britain and the United States in the Atlantic extending to the Pacific is worth asking. The newspaper cited the joint management of Canton and Enderbury Islands by Britain and the United States as proof, and also cited the recent remarks of retired US Navy officer and former commander of the US Yangtze River Patrol Gunboat Fleet, Rear Admiral Stirling F. Smith, and the American publisher, Howard, who emphasized that if the United States goes to war with Japan, its navy must use the Singapore naval base. The newspaper concluded by saying that after the failure of Britain's Far East policy, it agreed to block the Burma Road and has now placed its Far East interests under the protection of the United States. Although Britain and the United States have not reached a compromise on the Pacific, who dares to predict what will happen tomorrow? This is why Japan should pay attention to it.

### Hull Opposes Japanese Invasion of Vietnam, Unanimous Approval from U.S. Lawmakers

Washington: American congressional foreign relations experts recently unanimously approved Secretary of State Hull's statement opposing the invasion of Vietnam. New York Republican Congressman and member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Fish, indirectly praised the statement, saying that the content and meaning of this statement are very peaceful, while other lawmakers believe that this statement has far-reaching significance. California Democratic Congressman Isac said that this is clearly a warning to Japan, and Isac predicted that after the United States issued this warning, unless Japan believes that Germany has indeed defeated Britain, it will never invade Vietnam. (Fifth, United Press Dispatch)

Tokyo: According to Foreign Ministry spokesman Suma, who told newly arrived reporters today that the Foreign Ministry has not received detailed reports on the Vietnam negotiations, but General Nishihara has considerable discretion in conducting talks. The spokesman is aware of the impression abroad that Japan's ultimatum has been issued, but believes that this is quite questionable. The spokesman also said that the Japanese government will issue a formal statement on the situation in Vietnam in the coming days. Newspapers believe that the British-American agreement makes it more urgent for Japan to realize its goals for French Vietnam and the Dutch East Indies. Kokumin Shimbun said that the British-American compromise in the Atlantic has made the relationship between Britain and the United States in the Pacific closer, so Japan's policy towards Vietnam and the Dutch East Indies is even more important. Asahi Shimbun said that Britain and the United States have agreed to allow the US fleet to stay in the Pacific, so the United States' preparation to consolidate its backyard—the defense of the Pacific—is now clearly visible. (Fifth, Reuters Dispatch)

Tokyo: A spokesman for the Japanese Foreign Ministry recently stated that French-Japanese negotiations are still underway in Vietnam, and there are no new developments to report, but also said that Major General Nishihara, the leader of the Japanese monitoring group in Vietnam, has reportedly been authorized to act at will. An army spokesman said that there have been no reports here of the alleged "deadline" set by the Japanese side in the hope of obtaining a reply to their demands. (Fifth, United Press Dispatch)

### Japanese Expert Discusses U.S.-Japan War, Expresses Deep Fear of Soviet Air Raids

Tokyo: According to the "Hochi Shimbun", the opinion of Japanese aviation expert Mutō is that even if the United States and Japan go to war, the strength of the Japanese Navy is sufficient to avoid an American aerial blitzkrieg. Mutō believes that American aviators will not be able to break through the Japanese naval defense line. When discussing air defense in the event of war, Mutō said, "If Japan is forced to take military action against the United States, it will not be easy for the United States to bomb Japan, as Germany bombed Britain. Japan's airspace will never be filled with American aircraft. Another certainty is that the strength of the Japanese Navy is sufficient to prevent the US Navy from sailing past the 120th meridian in the Pacific. The Japanese Navy is indeed confident in this move. If war breaks out with the United States, Japan will deploy a 2,000-mile-long ring in the Pacific. The United States has no way to break through this. The United States may be able to let three or four aircraft slip into Japanese territory, but this number cannot be used for large-scale bombing. The US mainland is too far from Japan. Some people may think that the United States can use Hong Kong as a base to bomb Japan, but this is absolutely impossible. No one believes that Hong Kong will still exist as usual when the United States and Japan go to war. If the United States insists on launching a large-scale air raid on Japan, the only way is to abandon its aircraft fleet and move it as close to Japan as possible, but can the US ships really get close to Japan? However, there is an exception to this. If Britain flees to Canada with its 200 warships and places full naval authority in the hands of the Americans, it may be able to do something to Japan, but this is still very far from now. Although, if this matter involves the Soviet Union, Japan will be in great danger. If the Soviet Union goes to war with Japan, they can send planes from Korea to Japan in just two hours. Therefore, Japan must pay attention to this matter. However, if Vladivostok is destroyed before the Soviet Union acts, there is nothing to fear. Therefore, 'first come, first served is an invaluable path'." (Fifth, United Press Dispatch)

New York: Former Commander-in-Chief of the US China Fleet, Rear Admiral Yarnell, recently spoke to a New York correspondent, praising President Roosevelt's actions in concluding the British-American naval treaty and urging the British and American fleets to unite immediately, saying that this would defeat the Nazis and Japan, but time is of the essence. The reporter asked if there were any British bases in the Pacific under the same treaty that could be used by the United States. He said that the United States needs Singapore. (Fifth, Reuters Dispatch)

### United States and Australia Negotiating, Japanese Newspapers Paying Close Attention

Tokyo: Asahi Shimbun reported that, according to a New York Times Washington dispatch, the United States and Australia are currently conducting informal negotiations in accordance with the recent compromise between Canada and the United States. This matter is very noteworthy. Asahi Shimbun also speculated on the possibility of Germany winning the war against Britain, saying that Japan should prevent India, Malaya, and Australia from remaining under British control for a long time. A portion of the British fleet may move to the Far East. If so, the importance of Singapore as a naval base will inevitably increase. This is only natural. (Fifth, Reuters Dispatch)

Editorial

### Will Japan Use Force Against Vietnam?

Frequent reports over the past few days indicate that Saigon and Hong Kong have received intelligence that Japan is set to take military action against French Vietnam on September 6th. If these reports are accurate, then today marks the beginning of a new stage in the Far Eastern situation, and even the world situation. At the same time, various reports provide related information: (1) Japanese warships are massing outside Haiphong harbor in Vietnam, posing both a landing cover and a naval blockade; (2) Japanese troops have positioned themselves to cross the border from China's Guangxi Province into Vietnam near Kunlun Pass; (3) French authorities have rejected Japanese demands to transit troops through China and establish naval and air bases in Vietnam; (4) Vietnamese radio broadcasts announced the temporary suspension of scheduled rail transport; (5) The main force of the Japanese invasion of Vietnam is the navy, and its Naval Minister, Yoshida, known for being relatively moderate and prudent, has suddenly resigned due to illness; (6) There are rumors of internal unrest in Vietnam, with the Japanese-instigated fifth column actively in motion. If these reports are verified, they further illuminate the fact that Vietnam has become a burning focal point. The flame may be ignited by Tokyo, or by Japanese army and navy officers and soldiers surrounding Vietnam. If it burns, none of Vietnam's neighbors will be gleefully schadenfreude, nor will any nonchalantly watch the fire from across the river. However, this is not something to be despondent and worried about.

Whether today or tomorrow, or in the near or distant future, all drastic changes are not unexpected and cannot be predicted. Madness is too fashionable. For those who are mad, there is no way to anticipate their next move, so regardless of whether they move, or how they move, we can only calmly be prepared. Yesterday, a Washington dispatch reported that U.S. Secretary of State Hull made a mild and cultured statement: Washington is closely watching every action by Japan in the Far East that could affect Vietnam or the East Indies; the situation in French Vietnam is a matter the US government deems important; if Japan has indeed issued an ultimatum to the French authorities in Vietnam, there will be unfortunate repercussions in American public opinion. This is a secular expression of intention, and may not be ineffective. However, for its effectiveness to be certain, perhaps it would be better to issue a direct order to stop, or to extend an iron fist, rather than saying so mildly and culturedly.

But let's backtrack. The peak of Japan's madness seems to have passed, and it may now be at a crossroads of fatigue and awakening. If, during its fatigue, it does not experience one last surge of madness, then military action against Vietnam will not be realized, at least in the next day or two. The only reason is that it is factually too exhausted. Beyond this reason, if we add some rational commentary on its behalf, one is that it has decided, knowing its own exhaustion, that it will absolutely not take any further military action in other directions while its feet are still stuck in China. Of course, it is possible to deploy some troops on land or sea, but that is not what is meant by military action. Second, although France can be exploited in its distress, the non-humiliating and non-arrogant attitude recently adopted by the Vichy government suggests that it is not isolated in its difficulties, and that it has allies; there is no need to say more about the relationship between Germany and France; in the entire Far East, Britain and France seem to be separated by the Yangjingbang, and the situation on Edward Road can be representative of that; and then there is the United States, as Secretary Hull indicated yesterday, no one doubts that the United States has any ambition for Vietnam, or wants to divide the spoils, but only to maintain the status quo in Vietnam. Not long ago, the Asian side heard the United States reiterate the Monroe Doctrine in the Americas and Germany shout out Hitlerism in Europe, believing that they had closed their own doors, bound their own actions, and abandoned everything outside the door; this was either a naive misunderstanding or a loss of reason due to greed; but looking at the pros and cons of the Vietnam issue today, it is truly an important lesson. Third, Japan knows full well that Germany is powerless in the Far East, so there is no need to fear Germany now; it knows that it is best to follow in its footsteps, but it cannot meet its conditions; however, if it wants to do some bloodless business in the Far East, it still has to rely on "Our Friend, the Axis" as a facade; therefore, from a global perspective, it seems to have great manipulative skills, but the overt and covert reactions caused by the Vietnam issue cannot be ignored in a moment of wanton arbitrariness, lest it fall between the vertical and horizontal lines, and become a hunchback with nothing on either end. Fourth, the so-called New Order is still a matter of debate among the public, and has not yet been fully put on paper; even if it is put on paper and goes smoothly, it will still have to be gradually implemented and slowly take effect; and its main purpose, the only purpose, is to gather the remaining strength that has been consumed for three or four years and accelerate the creation of new strength, and it is definitely not to pool efforts and put another big fire to accelerate the destruction of what remains. Vietnam is richly endowed, but hopes to make a show of force and gain without labor. If it sheds blood, it will only show its madness.

### Vietnam Situation Slightly Calmer, Japanese Side Withdraws Ultimatum, Vietnamese Authorities Still Engaging in Defense, British Stand Firm to Defend Hong Kong to the End, Hong Kong-Vietnam Ships Allowed to Resume Navigation

Hong Kong: According to news from Kwangchowan, Japanese residents and the Japanese inspection team in Vietnam were initially ordered to leave the country yesterday, but have now been ordered to stay, but are still ordered to prepare to leave Vietnam at any time. Little direct news has come in, and all communications are subject to strict inspection. Japan has changed its attitude, and the tense situation has eased slightly, but it is said that French nationals are still evacuating the coastal areas of Vietnam, and the authorities are still engaging in defense. Admiral Decoux, the Governor-General of Vietnam, met with Japanese officials again yesterday, but the progress of the meeting has not been disclosed. However, according to unconfirmed reports, the purpose of the Japanese officials is to persuade the Vietnamese Governor to recognize a certain agreement reached between the Japanese representative in France and the Vichy government. (Fifth, Reuters Dispatch)

Hong Kong: The ban imposed by Hong Kong authorities three weeks ago on all American and Allied ships sailing to Vietnam was suddenly lifted this morning. Although there is no official announcement to explain this, it is generally believed that this move is mainly due to the withdrawal of the Japanese ultimatum and subsequent developments. (Fifth, Reuters Dispatch)

Saigon: It has now been confirmed that the Japanese ultimatum to Vietnam has indeed been withdrawn, and the Japanese consul has cancelled the order for Japanese residents in Vietnam to leave the country. (Fifth, Reuters Dispatch)

Hong Kong: Major General Grasett, Commander of the British Forces in Hong Kong, told seven American reporters who visited the defenses yesterday that Britain's policy is to defend Hong Kong to the end. After describing Hong Kong's defensive situation and its ability to repel a major attack, Grasett said that Hong Kong has now become a difficult place to attack, and its current position is purely defensive. Grasett also said that Britain's policy at this time is to maintain the main bases and abandon the non-essential lands. This policy has been demonstrated by the British withdrawal from British Moulmein. We must not allow Hong Kong to fall into enemy hands. Although the enemy may use a blockade to attack Hong Kong, the British Navy will be able to take effective action to deal with it. (Fifth, United Press Dispatch)

Hong Kong: Hong Kong-Vietnam-Kwangchowan shipping lines have been suspended for ten days. On the morning of the 5th, the shipping companies received an order from the Hong Kong government allowing them to resume sailing today. According to news from the shipping industry, the Japanese warships massing on the Vietnamese border have decreased slightly, and the Vietnamese authorities' order prohibiting ships from exporting was lifted last night.

Singapore: Well-informed sources in Singapore received news from Saigon stating that the Japanese ultimatum demanding that Vietnam allow Japanese troops to pass through has been temporarily withdrawn. (Reuters Note: Well-informed sources in Hong Kong also received the same news last night.) (Fifth, Reuters Dispatch)

Vichy: Regarding reports that negotiations between France and Japan over the Annam incident have stalled, the government yesterday officially released a statement denying it. The denial statement instead claimed, "Negotiations are underway in the hope of reaching an agreement, ensuring that the interests of both parties in the Far East are preserved." (Fifth, United Press Dispatch)

Chongqing: The English-language "Chu Pao" published an editorial titled "China's Interests in the South China Sea," stating that China is concerned about Japan's southward expansion, not only for strategic reasons, but also because it has important interests in the South China Sea. For centuries, Chinese people from the southern provinces of China have lived in various countries in the southern part of the South China Sea, and have created an economic territory. The remittances from overseas Chinese, especially those in the South China Sea, have become an important source of invisible income for the Chinese treasury, and have greatly contributed to the prosperity of the Min and Guangdong provinces. Many countries in South Asia have had long and close historical relations with China, such as French Vietnam, Burma, Thailand, the Malay Archipelago, the Straits Settlements, the Dutch East Indies, Borneo, and the Philippines. Annam was conquered by China in 214 BC. Although France forced China to give up its sovereignty over Annam in the mid-19th century, the Chinese have a strong influence in the national life of the country due to its long association with China. Chinese account for 400,000 of the 20 million residents, and most of them live in Cochinchina, where almost all industries and businesses are run by Chinese. Cholon (translated from Vietnamese), four miles from Saigon, is the center of trade for Chinese people in Vietnam. China also has similar interests in the Dutch East Indies. The tobacco plantations on the east coast of Sumatra employ more than 20,000 Chinese laborers, and the tin mines in Bangka Belitung employ several thousand Chinese laborers. All the towns in Borneo have Chinese residents who have lived there for generations, and most of the commerce is controlled by them. We can also list similar interests of Chinese people in other parts of the South China Sea. Therefore, if Japan can demand special interests in these places, then China has even more reason to demand them. As for French Vietnam, if the lives and property of the Chinese people there are threatened by the Japanese, China will not hesitate to protect them with force. China is also prepared to cooperate with the relevant powers in other parts of the South China Sea to curb Japan's ambitions. (Fifth, Reuters Dispatch)

Chongqing: A Chinese military spokesman said that the Chinese army is prepared to enter Vietnam once Japanese troops land in Vietnam. The spokesman also believes that Major General Nishihara's ultimatum to Vietnam is a kind of intimidation, "because Japan believes that it can force the French to submit without relying on actual military action." The spokesman continued that if Japan concentrates a large army in Vietnam or confirms that its actions have diplomatic support, it may launch a war in Vietnam, but a force of one or two divisions is unlikely to be up to the task.

(2) The Chinese forces launched an attack on the Japanese troops in Haoji, Wangdian, Yuliangzhai (all northwest of Tongshan), and other strongholds, and entered the Japanese positions, defeating the Japanese troops, killing hundreds of Japanese soldiers, and seizing a large number of spoils of war. (3) A part of the Japanese forces in Suqian, with two artillery pieces, escorted military supplies to Qiaoyan Town (north of Suqian).

### United States Proceeding to Lease Two Pacific Islands to Strengthen the Defense of the Panama Canal; Secretary of the Navy Knox Arrives in San Francisco

San Francisco: Secretary of the Navy Colonel Knox announced here yesterday that the United States is proceeding to lease the two Pacific islands of "Canal Peagas" and "Cocos" to further strengthen the defense of the Western Hemisphere. Colonel Knox stated that the United States should make the Panama Canal militarily impregnable, so the government should build more naval bases, as the canal cannot be fully protected solely by airplanes based in the country. After obtaining British consent, the United States exchanged 50 overage destroyers for 99-year leases of British bases in the Western Hemisphere. Since the establishment of this agreement, the United States has obtained the Atlantic gateway to the Panama Canal. If the lease of "Canal Peagas" and "Cocos" is established, the Pacific gateway to the Panama Canal can also be protected without worry. Colonel Knox arrived here yesterday to inspect the naval bases in the Pacific. He will fly to Hawaii to inspect Pearl Harbor. Afterwards, he may continue to inspect the U.S. bases on the Pacific islands of Washington, Oregon, and Alaska. (Associated Press dispatch of the 5th)

The United States Will Allocate Huge Sums to Build Bases

Salt Lake City: Secretary of the Navy Knox told reporters here last night that the United States will soon allocate $250 million to prepare for the construction of naval and air bases on land obtained from Britain. This exchange will surely cause a great uproar and will encounter the huge opposition encountered by the draft law during the last Great War, but Congress is aware of the trend of public opinion. He denied that the new British-American agreement had forced the United States to welcome war. He claimed that if Hitler sought an excuse to declare war on the United States, he could have long ago found a reason to declare war. When the House of Representatives met in Washington yesterday afternoon, members either called the transfer of destroyers "clearly an act of war" or said "this move is good." Opinions differed, and the debate was short, emotional, and inconclusive. Speaker Bankhead met with President Roosevelt before the meeting and told reporters that the rumors in the newspapers that the United States was negotiating with the Netherlands or Togo for bases in the West Indies were castles in the air and that there were no plans to seek more bases at present.

Boston Prepares to Accommodate Transferred Ships

Boston: The local naval authorities stated yesterday that Boston should begin preparations to accommodate the 50 destroyers that the United States is transferring to Britain.

The first batch of eight will sail to Halifax, Nova Scotia, this Friday. According to the authorities, the local naval base and dry docks will quickly make various preparations to accommodate the aforementioned ships. The local dry dock may be used to inspect the destroyers and, if necessary, to carry out repairs and refueling. (Associated Press dispatch)

### Germany and Spain Establish Aviation Agreement

The "Clermont-Ferrand Pioneer Report" in France recently reported that the German government has reached an agreement with Spain to restore the aviation routes between the two countries that existed before the outbreak of the European war in September last year. Because most of the staff serving on these routes before the war were German nationals, the Spanish government was deeply afraid of causing displeasure to France and therefore suspended all air routes. Now that France and Germany have ceased hostilities, there is no reason to continue the suspension of the aforementioned routes. In short, the German-Spanish agreement is nothing more than a restoration of the pre-war status quo. (Havas dispatch of the 4th)

### German Winter Relief Campaign Begins: Hitler Delivers Speech: Must Fight Britain to the End; Appeals to the People to Unite

Berlin: German leader Hitler delivered a speech at the Berlin Sports Palace yesterday, announcing the start of the second year of the wartime winter relief campaign, reviewing the war situation, stating that the achievements of the first year of the European war were not only unimaginable to the enemy, but also not fully understood by most German people. Although the first year of the World War had unprecedented sacrifices, the war gains obtained only accounted for a part of the current war gains. The achievements of the last twelve months can be

represented by a triangle. The triangle currently occupied by the German army extends east to the Bug River, north to Narvik and the North Cape, and south to the Spanish border. Britain only relied on the advantages of its geographical location to make a quick escape, avoiding the fate of immediate collapse. The British army had contact with the German army and had many opportunities to fight, but the British army quietly withdrew. Italy, as Germany's ally, took the offensive in East Africa, defeating the British army and strengthening Italy's position. British propaganda has turned German victories into British victories, and these "victories" cannot be understood by people with sound minds. Mr. Hitler gave examples to prove this. After the Allied forces were defeated in Norway and forced to withdraw, they declared that they hoped to withdraw from Norway. After the collapse of France, Britain declared that it could concentrate its forces and wage a more effective war against Germany. When the European war broke out, Britain expected the war to last for two years. Mr. Hitler declared that he had told Goering at the time,

to prepare for a five-year war. This preparation was not because the war might last five years, or because he believed the war would last five years, but as a precaution. Mr. Hitler solemnly declared that he knew that the end of the war was the collapse of Britain, and that the collapse of Britain would certainly become a reality. Germany has made meticulous preparations. Mr. Hitler declared that,

the world needs freedom, and one country must not blockade a continent, nor must one country make 540,000,000 people fall into the abyss of poverty. We cannot tolerate Britain dictating our work or dictating whether we can drink coffee. It is an intolerable situation if 85,000,000 people are punished only because of the decisions of London financiers. Mr. Hitler continued, stating that Germany was prepared to join hands with Britain, and understanding with Britain was the goal of German foreign policy. He is still willing to achieve a clear decision, the meaning of which is to remove the

pro-war government and build an environment in Europe that is not threatened by any country. Germany and Italy will never allow any country to threaten the whole of Europe again. Britain and its collapsed allies will not be able to stop Germany and Italy from achieving their goals. We are closely watching their conspiracies, we are prepared to act at any time, we are not afraid of any threats, the National Socialist Party has experienced the most difficult times and will not be intimidated by any situation. Britain predicted "revolution" and "famine", we will answer with "action" when the time is ripe. Mr. Hitler expressed his sincere thanks to the German Air Force. Currently, German planes are fighting against Britain every day. Mr. Hitler also thanked the people in the rear, and mentioned that 700,000 residents who were evacuated from the German border to the interior when the European war broke out acted resolutely and fearlessly. The British Air Force has recently raided Germany at night and indiscriminately bombed civilians because it cannot attack Germany during the day, because the German air defense forces will intercept them. Germany has not responded to British air raids for three months, which Churchill regards as a sign of weakness. Currently, German planes have been

attacking Britain at night and are increasing the extent of their bombing. If the British Air Force drops thousands of kilograms of bombs every night, the German Air Force will drop hundreds of thousands of kilograms of bombs every night. If British planes carry out heavy bombing of German cities, German planes will also destroy British cities. One of Britain and Germany will perish in the war, and the one that collapses will not be National Socialist Germany. Mr. Hitler continued, stating that Germany

must fight to the end, and the prerequisite is the united solidarity of the people. Without a people determined to fight, German soldiers will not be able to achieve the current war gains. The current purpose of the war is not the victory of the war, but the construction of a new country. The achievements of National Socialism are social reforms, which are feared by Jews and financiers. However, the future world will continue to develop along this path, and countries that cannot follow this path will collapse. The current war is a war to build the social foundation of Germany. The winter relief work during the war is a powerful manifestation of building spirit and a great educator's work. The achievements of recent years have shown a great victory. Future life will be more and more pleasant. Mr. Hitler finally thanked the workers of the first year of the wartime winter relief and

appealed to the German people to assist in the progress of the second year of the winter relief, hoping that the second year of the winter relief would once again show the world the inseparability of German society, so that all countries in the world would understand that expecting a "revolution" in Germany is in vain, and that the German people can all "do their duty together". National spirit will make Germany make a firm decision. The 85,000,000 people in Germany are truly a people with the same hearts, fighting shoulder to shoulder on the front lines with the same wishes and determination, which has created an unconquerable country. (Haitong News Agency dispatch of the 5th)

Berlin: The German newspapers published yesterday morning on the front page with large headlines the speech delivered by leader Hitler in Berlin, guaranteeing that Britain will collapse. The "Berlin Financial Daily" commented, stating that if the British people cannot understand the faith that the German people place in the leader, then the leader's speech yesterday will surely enlighten the British people that Germany is a country with a sense of life and duty, vowing to eliminate Britain's maritime and aerial plundering, until the final decision. Germany's 85 million people have cleared Europe of enemies in a year. Germany will be able to give Britain the final blow when the time is chosen. The leader has a definite grasp of this.

### German Planes Attack Britain Again Yesterday: British Planes Intercept and Dogfight Multiple Times: A Few German Planes Fly to the Outskirts of London to Drop Bombs: Germany Claims to Have Sunk a British Destroyer

London: This morning, German bombers and fighters broke through the outer defenses of the southeast coast and flew towards the Thames River and London, but were repelled by fierce anti-aircraft fire and the machine gun fire of British fighters. Because the internal air defenses of London are tight, most of the German planes did not have time to drop bombs and flew back. A few German planes dropped several bombs in the suburbs. British planes pursued them until the coast. Today, German planes also raided the Midlands, Northwest, and Southwest regions. According to official claims, a large number of German planes flew over the southeast coast this morning, and some of them flew to the outskirts of London and dropped several bombs, but the reports received so far indicate that there was no major damage. British anti-aircraft positions and fighters inflicted heavy damage on the German planes. Fierce battles took place continuously during the air raid this morning, and three German Messerschmitts were shot down. (Reuters dispatch of the 5th)

Berlin: This morning, the targets of German bombers were the Hill and Cannes airfields. In the beginning, the British strength was weak and did not put up strong resistance. Afterwards, the number of British planes responding to the battle increased and there were multiple dogfights. Many British planes were shot down. The initial air raid alarm in London this morning lasted 50 minutes. (Haitong dispatch of the 5th)

### British Air Raids on Berlin at Night

Berlin: Regarding the British aircraft night raid on Berlin last night, the official gazette was issued here at dawn as follows: On the night of September 4th, British aircraft attacked Berlin at night. However, due to the dense German anti-aircraft fire, only a few aircraft entered Berlin's airspace after one enemy aircraft was shot down. Two heavy bombs were dropped. One fell on Tiertaden, killing one police officer on duty. The other fell on an ammunition depot in the northwest suburbs, but the damage was minimal. A workers' dormitory was also hit by a bomb, killing and injuring one worker each. (Haitong Telegraph, 5th)

London: The Air Ministry's Information Office stated that Berlin suffered its fifth attack in nine days on the night of the 3rd of this month. Military targets were repeatedly bombed by British aircraft. British aircraft repeatedly dived to attack a power station on the outskirts of Berlin. Although the low-hanging clouds obscured the details, many bombs were seen hitting the target area, and flashes of fire were seen. Another power station was bombed by British aircraft from an altitude of 7,500 feet. A gas plant was hit by a high-explosive bomb, immediately causing a large fire, and thick smoke rose like clouds. The second batch of attacking British aircraft bombed an arsenal, causing a deafening explosion. The light illuminated the low clouds, making them bright. The main railway lines on the outskirts of Berlin and the railway lines near the city were also bombed. Shortly after midnight, British aircraft dropped high-explosive bombs and incendiary bombs on forested areas outside Berlin, such as the Grunewald Forest, with the aim of setting fire to the arsenals hidden in the forest. Two large fires immediately broke out in the forest north of the city. Fifteen minutes after the British aircraft flew away from the area, the crew turned their heads and looked back, still seeing the flames soaring upwards. After one British aircraft dropped a bomb on the Grunewald Forest, two explosions were seen 150 yards away, bright and yellow. Another batch of British aircraft that attacked at night concentrated on bombing the large Maqui Fort oil refinery and oil storage target area from southeast to northeast, causing fire and burning. One of the British aircraft sent to attack Maqui Fort hovered over the area for more than half an hour, searching for its target, but was eventually prevented by ground smoke and darkness. It then found the main railway intersection of the city and dropped a huge bomb. Arsenals and ammunition factories in the forests of northwestern Germany and the Habach Mountains were also attacked at night on the 3rd. This was the first time the area had been bombed. British aircraft dropped hundreds of incendiary bombs, and the surrounding pine forests caught fire and burned, the fire spread, and explosions rumbled. British aircraft were able to find the secret military targets they wanted to attack. One place was extremely hot, and it could still be seen from the air 70 miles away. (Reuters Telegram, 3rd)

### The Scope of British-German Air Combat is Extensive

London: Yesterday, a large squadron of German aircraft engaged in air combat with British aircraft. The intensity of the battle reached its peak, and the scope of the air combat was also extremely wide. After crossing the English Channel at dusk, German aircraft attacked the London area and several cities in southeastern England. The third air raid alarm of the day in London was issued on time amidst the explosions and the roar of anti-aircraft guns outside the capital. The last air raid by German aircraft began at 9:03 PM (Shanghai daylight saving time was 6:00 AM on Thursday) and lasted for one hour and thirty-seven minutes. The air raids and air battles on Wednesday lasted until late at night. The British side considers this battle to be a great victory, as 45 German aircraft were shot down in this battle, while the British warplanes only lost 11. (International News Agency Telegram, 5th)

London: According to the latest report, the scope of last night's air raids was quite extensive. At least six German bombers attempting to break through London's defenses were shot down. After the air raid alert was lifted in the London area, searchlights still illuminated the sky. In a certain location in the southeast, 30 to 40 bombs fell within five minutes. Another German aircraft attempted to strafe the soldiers in charge of the searchlights with machine guns. Several high-explosive bombs fell in various rural areas of the Midlands. Houses were slightly damaged, and there were very few casualties. Two air raids occurred in the northeast area. A certain city on the coast of Wales and the southwest also experienced long periods of air raids. The garrison continued to repel the attacks with anti-aircraft fire. The damage caused by the bombs was very minor. (Reuters Telegram, 5th)

Berlin: The official communiqué at 4:00 PM today stated that the first German Air Force unit attacked airfields in southern England, shot down 20 British fighter planes, and returned to its original defense safely. Only five were missing. (Haitong News Agency Telegram, 5th)

Stockholm: A reporter from the "Nichte" newspaper stationed in Berlin claimed that an air raid alarm sounded in Berlin at 0:05 AM this morning and was lifted at 2:10 AM, lasting approximately two hours. (Reuters Telegram, 5th)

It is said that a smaller troop transport ship was also sunk by torpedoes two weeks ago. (Reuters Telegram, 5th)

London: The German Air Force once again attempted to break through the defenses of southeastern England and sneak into London yesterday, but failed. Forty-five aircraft were lost, including 35 bombers or fighter-bombers. The British side lost a total of 11 fighter planes, but it is reported that the pilots of five of them parachuted to safety. London issued air raid alerts three times yesterday, the last time from 8:03 PM to 10:42 PM. However, the German aircraft were intercepted and defeated before they could drop bombs on London. (Reuters Telegram, 5th)

London: Last night, German aircraft attempted to sneak into the center of London with great ferocity, just hours after Hitler threatened retaliation for the British Air Force's heavy bombing of military targets in Berlin. However, countless anti-aircraft guns in southeastern London fired simultaneously, forming a network of fire that prevented the German aircraft from entering. Last night, the anti-aircraft fire in London was extremely intense, and more than a hundred searchlights illuminated the sky, as bright as day. The defenses were unprecedentedly tight. The flashing lights, mixed with the fire from the exploding anti-aircraft shells and the white, red, and blue flares dropped by the German aircraft, were a spectacle to behold. Suddenly, a flash of white light appeared, indicating brightness, presumably caused by a barrage balloon catching fire. (Reuters Telegram, 5th)

### Italian Aircraft Bomb the British Fleet in the Mediterranean Sea, Reportedly Hitting Two British Ships, Italian Military Ports Also Attacked

Rome: The Italian Military Headquarters issued a war report this afternoon stating that three cruisers and two destroyers of the British fleet patrolling the coast of Algeria were attacked by our aircraft. Bombs hit two of the ships, one of which caught fire and burned on the spot. Yesterday, a large British convoy was in the Aegean Sea. In order to protect the safety of the convoy, the British dispatched naval and air forces to attack the Italian naval and air bases in the Aegean Sea this morning. Two British aircraft teams bombed Kakura and Marie Chai separately. Two Italian aircraft on land were destroyed. At the same time, British warships fired on Sesebala, causing slight damage to houses and injuring many civilians. As a result, they were still repelled by our destroyers and anti-aircraft guns, shooting down a total of seven enemy aircraft and capturing three people. After repelling the enemy aircraft, our aircraft began to retaliate. From 7:00 AM to 7:30 AM this morning, they went in five batches to bomb British ships, hitting five of them and shooting down five enemy destroyers. Two of our aircraft did not return to their original defense, and three airmen were injured. On the North African front, the air forces of both sides were also very active. One person was killed and eleven were injured in an enemy air raid, and material losses were minimal. Four enemy aircraft were shot down, and our aircraft all returned to their original defenses safely. On the East African front, enemy aircraft bombed the Yeffro airfield. We shot down one. Our bombers dropped bombs in the Red Sea and hit a British ship. (Haitong News Agency Telegram, 5th)

### Random Notes on the European War (1): The Destitution of Young Hitler

Young Hitler is now almost thirteen years old. He has endured many hardships, struggling with poverty, and is gradually about to see the end of his suffering. It is truly said that Heaven, in bestowing great responsibility upon a person, must first afflict his mind, tax his sinews and bones. Hitler later revealed this idea in his writings, but his dissatisfaction and resentment grew with each passing day. His level of self-discipline and purity of mind was even more advanced than in his childhood. When he lived in small hostels, he was known for not seeking out women. There was also another thing: other people often undressed in public rooms, without shame. When Hitler changed his clothes, he would always hide far away in the corner, secretly and uneasily, so no one had ever seen his body. He was also very meticulous about what he ate, partly because of his weak stomach, and partly because he believed that meat was unclean and could disturb his nature. He only ate vegetables and millet porridge. As for alcohol, he did not touch a drop. His eyes were huge, full of overflowing passion? Although his body was relatively thin and short, his head was described as "beautiful." He had a small mustache under his nose, and he walked with a very light step.

He wandered around the city of Vienna, often talking to himself. As soon as he had money, he would go to the opera, which was his only pastime. At this time, he loved to read the eccentric "Ethnology" written by the French Count Gobineau, and he supported Germanism. He also loved Wagner's music, and he had a special understanding of those operas. In addition to opposing communists and Jews, he also expressed hatred for members of parliament and other bureaucrats in democratic governments. He often went to the Austrian House of Representatives to listen to debates, and he was greatly angered when he saw that the members were mostly people of mixed race, not of German descent. At this time, in his own writings, he clearly explained how much he hated mixed-race people.

At the age of twenty-three, Hitler left Vienna for Munich, Germany. There, he worked as a painter or as an assistant to a picture framer. Two years later, the European War broke out, and he enlisted in the German army, first as a corporal, then as a sergeant, and was deeply valued by his superiors. His patriotic feelings were very high, and he spoke more than others among his peers. His superiors used his enthusiasm, and specially asked him to undertake solitary and dangerous work, such as delivering messages and solitary scouting. He was injured twice and was seriously suffocated by gas. During the war, he put a small photo of his mother in the left pocket of his uniform in front of his chest. During his leave, he was still strict with himself, behaving like an ascetic. At this time, he shaved off his beard, leaving only a short mustache.

The colonel of Hitler's regiment died in battle not long after the start of the war. Before long, a new commander arrived, and he followed the team to the front line. Suddenly, several bullets flew from above. Hitler jumped out of the ranks, covered the new commander with his body, and bravely shouted that he did not want the second commander to die in such a short time." His companions were somewhat puzzled by this gesture. Afterwards, they teased him and said that if he really wanted to save the commander, he should have pushed him down first, so that he was lying flat on the ground, and then covered his body. Standing in front of him was useless. But they admitted that he could be a hero, but it was difficult to be with him.

In the army, he never complained like other soldiers often did, and he never spoke ill of his superiors. His words and actions were completely unlike a soldier; he often used glory, patriotism, and sacrifice for the country as his mantra. However, some people said that he was too verbose. Once, he went to a stronghold in the rear and met a soldier who was listlessly talking on a military telephone. The soldier said that he did not care who won the battle. Hitler was furious when he heard this, and beat him severely. Later, he also reported this matter to his superiors, saying the reason why he was angry, and the officers praised and encouraged him. He was respectful and sincere to the officers, and could be said to be meticulous. One day, he and a brother were knocked down into the mud by the explosion of a German heavy artillery, and they could not even breathe. He once captured several French soldiers single-handedly and was awarded the Iron Cross First Class. Several young adjutants thought that such a brave soldier should be promoted to lieutenant, but Hitler's immediate superior said, "I will never promote such a neurotic person to be an officer."

Once, Hitler was injured and wrote a letter from the hospital to the commander saying, "Please call me back to camp immediately. I do not want to stay in Munich when my brothers are attacking the enemy." He returned to the team after recovering from his injuries, and still served as a sergeant. He looked at the war as if it were his own personal struggle. The German defeat was as if he himself had been defeated. This was the only heartbreaking thing since he had been unable to become an artist and had become a wanderer. When the news of the armistice arrived, he was in the hospital for the second time, lying in a hammock, burying his head under the pillow, and crying. Finally, he still attributed the cause of Germany's defeat to the Communist Party and the Jews, and only then did he feel a little relieved.

On the day the armistice treaty was signed, Hitler was already twenty-nine years old. He was more mature than those in history who had claimed to be world conquerors. In reality, although Hitler claimed to be this, the actual launch of this "great event" was delayed until he was fifty years old. In terms of personality, Hitler at this time had many similarities with Alexander I, Genghis Khan, Muhammad, Caesar, William I, and Napoleon. In terms of tools and preparations, he was even stronger than them in some respects. He was alone, without the burden of a family; no family, no friends, and he did not want to fall in love with women. As for his not drinking, it was well known to the public. His asceticism covered his physical surface with a mysterious color. He had a strong latent ability, which had been developed through many trials and tribulations, and could transform the pain he had suffered into a dream of victory. This belief became more and more difficult to shake. He was well-read and quite eloquent. The principles he put forward were always based on classics and could justify themselves. He had two pure dreams: one was to remember his mother, and the other was to realize the idea of ​​a Greater Germany. If he fell in love with anything, the final conclusion could not escape these two things. Outwardly, he was not very moving, but his inner strength was very impressive. This was similar to the previous group of people who claimed to be world conquerors. Their "seeds" were the same, and they were all born with different "gifts." They suffered disasters in their childhood, were depressed and unhappy, and even disturbed and agitated, acting recklessly. When they grew up, they were either addicted to sex and lived a promiscuous and chaotic life, or they were extremely eccentric in terms of sex.

In 1919, Hitler was ordered by his superior to go to Munich to participate in a gathering against Jews, anti-capitalists, anti-communists, and anti-anythingism, to spy on their actions. This small group had unique political views and wanted to use new methods to save the defeated Germany. They advocated that Germany must have a leader. Hitler, with his gray, watery eyes, a tuft of hair covering his forehead, a short beard, soft hands, and inner nervousness, sat there ferociously, listening with a self-proclaimed world conqueror's attitude. The second time he went to participate, this time not by order of his superiors, because the army was already useless, but he went himself. That time, he was elected as the seventh member of this gathering (that is, today's National Socialist Party). After all his failures, young Hitler finally became a politician.

In 1923, he led a failed rebellion and was imprisoned. In prison, he wrote a book, "My Struggle," in which he had written various plans to conquer the world fifteen years before he came to power. This can be said to be "unprecedented." He was released after one year and one month in prison. In 1932, he was appointed by President Hindenburg to form a cabinet. Thus, he seized power, eliminated dissidents, and became the dictator of Germany. In 1939, he realized his dream of conquering Europe (End of this article).

### After U.S. Admiral Hepner Arrives in Shanghai, He Holds Two Important Meetings, Reviews the General Situation and Discusses Plans, the U.S. Does Not Concede on the Issue of Defense Zones

According to foreign sources, U.S. Asian Fleet Commander Admiral Hepner arrived in Shanghai at 1:00 PM the day before yesterday on the cruiser Marblehead. That afternoon, he met at the U.S. Consulate General with Fourth Fleet Commander Colonel Baker, Yangtze River Fleet Commander Glassford, and Acting Consul General Broderick. There were reports and discussions. Yesterday morning, Hepner resumed discussions with Broderick and others at the same location. When reporters asked Broderick about Hepner's mission and the content of the meetings, Broderick declined to comment. One official said that the purpose of the meetings between U.S. officials was to make contact with each other, which was a matter of course. However, authoritative sources believe that the discussions convened by Admiral Hepner must be related to the issue of defense zones and other current situation issues. Hepner's arrival must be to convey the intentions of the government and to determine the methods that the U.S. should take to deal with the current situation. As for the attitude of the U.S. government, it was reported yesterday that private individuals in this port had already received telegrams from Washington, stating that "The U.S. government has today formally and publicly warned Japan that the U.S. is paying close attention to every action of Japan in the Far East that affects Vietnam and the Dutch East Indies. At the same time, Secretary of State Hull publicly declared to reporters that the U.S. refuses to allow the Japanese to take over any defense zones left by British troops in the Shanghai International Settlement.

### No Progress in Defense Zone Negotiations

The Shanghai Times stated that after the Shanghai International Settlement Volunteer Corps temporarily took over the "B" defense zone of the Public Concession, a rotational system has now been adopted. Before the 16th, the British troops of the West Fork Highland Regiment withdrew, and the A Company of the Volunteer Corps filled the defense for a week. It was decided that the cavalry and B Company would be successively transferred for defense, each guarding for four days. As of 8:00 PM yesterday (the 4th), the A Company replaced the B Company in rotation.

A Company Has a Longer Defense Period

A Company dispatches two officers and fifty-one soldiers from Company A, Company B, the Scottish Company, and the Light Machine Gun Company every day to defend five positions in the "B" defense zone. However, A Company has more soldiers, so it is stationed for one week each time, while B Company and the Cavalry Company have fewer soldiers, and each defends for four days. On average, the soldiers of the three major companies are deployed for twenty-four hours every sixteen days."

Defense Zone Talks Still Have No News

At the same time, there is still no news on the talks between the U.S. and Japan regarding the defense zone issue in this city. Therefore, it is difficult to determine how long the Volunteer Corps will defend in the "B" zone. Some people believe that the current method of the Volunteer Corps will continue for several months. As for the "D" defense zone, which was designated to be handed over to the Japanese army, the Japanese army has not yet taken it over. The area is currently guarded by patrolmen from the Shanghai Municipal Police Department and "City Police." The "Zi Lin West News" also stated that the U.S. and Japanese authorities are consulting on the issue of permanent patrol of the "B" defense zone of the Public Concession in this city. The situation is currently at a standstill. The "B" zone will continue to be defended by the International Volunteer Corps until the two sides reach a final decision."

Positions are Mostly on the North Bank of the Suzhou Creek

It is found that the "B" zone originally started from the Bund in the east and ended at Yuqiaqing Road, from Eddoe Road in the south to the boundary road in the north. However, at present, except for the Russian team of the Volunteer Corps guarding the southern end of the Waibaidu Bridge, no Volunteer Corps is deployed south of the Suzhou Creek.

The Number of Soldiers Determines the Number of Times

The duration of the company's deployment is determined by the number of soldiers it can deploy. It is now determined that A Company took over the defense for the second time last night. On the 11th of this month, the cavalry and armored vehicle teams will be transferred for defense. On the 15th, B Company will be deployed again. On the 19th, A Company will be deployed again in rotation. Each defense house north of the Suzhou Creek is stationed with one non-commissioned officer and four soldiers, each deployment lasting twenty-four hours. During this time, each soldier takes turns on sentry duty for two hours and rests for four hours.

The Facilities in the Defense Houses are Very Comfortable

The facilities in the defense houses are complete, and every effort is made to make the soldiers comfortable. A row of marching beds is placed along the wall, and bedding is provided by the soldiers themselves. There is also a radio for playing music. Three meals a day are quite exquisite and are delivered by trucks dispatched by the Volunteer Corps Headquarters. When the soldiers are resting, they either play cards, read books in bed, or chat and laugh, and their spirits are very full.

### Telegram from Hong Kong The Shanghai-Vietnam Route Resumes The Hong Kong-Vietnam Route Has Resumed The Zhou Ship is Preparing to Sail to Fang

The Japanese also sent supervisors to Vietnam. At that time, the Shanghai-Vietnam shipping route was suspended for a time and then resumed on the 10th. In the middle of last month, the Japanese again asked the Vietnamese authorities to allow the army, navy, and air force to pass through Vietnam in an attempt to attack, causing the situation in Vietnam to become tense again.

The Situation in Vietnam is Uncertain

Although the French and Japanese governments have directly negotiated, there have been no results so far. Therefore, on the 28th of last month, the Vietnamese authorities voluntarily closed the ports for precautionary reasons. The Hong Kong-Vietnam-Shanghai shipping route was interrupted again. The details have been recorded in previous reports. In the past week, rumors have been rife, mainly because the situation in Vietnam is unstable.

In addition, the Butterfield & Swire Qiongzhou ship will sail to Little Luzon and Singapore, and the Taiyuan ship will go directly to Hong Kong. It was originally scheduled to leave the port yesterday afternoon, but both ships were changed to set sail at 6:00 am this morning due to insufficient cargo loading.

The Shanghai Branch of the Central Bank issued subsidiary currency notes of one and five cents, totaling 7 million yuan, with the approval of the Ministry of Finance, in order to alleviate the shortage of subsidiary currency notes in Shanghai. They have been issued in batches and are circulating in the market. They were all printed by the American Yongning Company. A reporter from the "Xin Sheng News Agency" learned from the Central Bank yesterday about the issue of counterfeit five-cent notes found on the market. It was confirmed that the English on the back of the genuine notes was (UNION PUBLISHERS AND PRINTERS FED. INC. U.S.A.), while the counterfeit notes were (UNIONPRINTING CO. U.S.A.). In fact, this was due to batch printing. The former was issued later and printed by the American United Yongning Company, while the latter was issued earlier and printed by the American Yongning Company, and were not counterfeit notes. Currently, all the notes printed and issued are the former.

### Rice Prices Have Exceeded the New Limit the Crisis is Latent Rice Shops Ask the Authorities to Thoroughly Clarify the Market Rice Weevils are Intent on Mischief One Person Was Arrested Yesterday The Next Batch of Fair-Priced Rice Starts on the 19th

The Shanghai Rice Industry Association sent a letter to the two authorities yesterday regarding the continuous rise in rice prices. The letter stated, "Respected Sirs, in recent days, rice prices have risen and cannot be suppressed. Although the Evaluation Committee has exercised its judgment and relaxed the price limit in accordance with the authorities' intention, it is still ineffective. Rice prices are still rising, and today (5th) the market quotation is even more soaring. The top-grade Saigon rice is quoted as high as 67-8 yuan, which is far from the 61.5 yuan limit set by the Evaluation Committee for top-grade Saigon rice."

Difficult to Buy Low-Quality Goods at High Prices

"If we purchase low-quality goods at the highest rice price set by the Evaluation Committee, it will be difficult to get what we want. Our retail rice shops, which directly supply the food for the entire city, purchase low-quality goods at the highest price. Even if we sell them at a loss, the citizens do not understand the truth and misunderstand us, and criticisms follow. At this time, the prices of all goods are rising, and the general public is already feeling threatened. However, rice prices are rising again and again without end, and people's livelihood is even more unbearable. Our members also feel very difficult. If we do not take measures to help them, we will cause most of the poor people to be unable to find food. The weak will be filled in the trenches, and the strong will take risks, which will also affect local security. Our association witnesses the chaotic situation in the market and the endless rise in rice prices, with hundreds of crises. We are compelled to submit this letter and request that your bureau quickly find ways to provide relief, thoroughly clarify the chaotic situation in the rice market, strictly enforce the price limit set by the Evaluation Committee, and send more officers to strictly inspect the rice market at any time."

One Rice Weevil Was Arrested Yesterday

"If there is any act of exceeding the price limit or secretly raising prices, we will immediately detain them to maintain people's food and protect security. This is addressed to the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession and the Board of Directors of the French Concession." It was heard that a rice weevil was arrested by the market police in the market yesterday morning and sent to justice.

Chairman Yu Qiaqing reported that (1) the second phase of donations totaled 287,373.95 yuan by September 3; (2) the second phase was decided by the general meeting to continue to handle 60,000 bags of broken rice for fair-priced rice. Now it has been completed. The results of the committee's deliberations yesterday are as follows: The current phase of fair-priced rice will expire on the 8th to the 20th of this month. According to the procedures, the rice shops should be replaced.

The rice will be sold at 4 catties per yuan, limited to one yuan per person, and each family will issue 50 bags of rice per day until it is sold out.

### Yang Binghua Abandoned Her After Initial Affection Two Women Fought Over Jealousy A Shanghai Opera Actress Moved Away Furniture Sentenced to Detention with a Two-Year Reprieve

Yang Binghua, also known as Xiaoyang the Clerk, is a local man, 37 years old, living at No. 15 Pingquan Villa, Maibike Road. Before August 13, he was a detective in the Nanshi Police Department. After leaving his job, he relied on his mistress, Ding Wan'e, a famous Shanghai Opera actress (36 years old, a local, living at No. 21 Xinxin'an Lane, Mintineyin Road), to support his life. Last year, Yang formed an inseparable bond with the daughter of the Eastern Hotel, Tianzhen, a palm reader (who was once sensationalized for robbing diamond rings).

A Lasting Bond

They built a golden house to hide their love. Soon, Yang raised funds to go to Suzhou to open the Dalu Entertainment Park, and took Tianzhen with him, abandoning Ding like a worn-out shoe. This year, Ding discovered that her lover had a new love, and she could not help but feel jealous. She rushed to the place, but Yang actually favored Tianzhen and beat Ding severely. Ding came to Shanghai in anger and took all the rosewood big beds, noodle soup tables, five-drawer cabinets, and wardrobes in the house, claiming to entrust the Detai Rosewood Workshop on Zilai Street to repair them, and moved them to No. 21 Rafide Road for hiding. When Yang's Suzhou Dalu Entertainment Park failed and returned, he discovered the theft and repeatedly questioned Ding.

Firmly Denies It

Yang Binghua hired lawyer Yang Dong to represent him and filed a private prosecution against Ding in the Criminal Division of the Special Second Court for theft under Article 320 of the Criminal Law. According to the complaint, the court opened a second criminal trial by Judge Zhu Chuzhe yesterday morning. The defendant hired lawyer Jin Yu to defend and argued that the two parties were spouses and could not file a private prosecution according to law. After a detailed hearing in court, because the two parties were not formally legally married, the hearing was continued. As a result of the hearing, the court made a judgment in court. The main text of Ding Wan'e was theft and was sentenced to 40 days of detention with a two-year reprieve. The defendant declared that he would not accept the judgment and could appeal to the High Third Branch after receiving the judgment.

Since the French Concession police and French defense forces implemented a blockade of all road junctions along Avenue Edward VII on the morning of the 4th, taking strict precautions, almost all police personnel and French troops have been mobilized. The area has been peaceful and orderly for days, ensuring public safety. Rumors that the French Concession's precautions were due to the Vietnam issue are purely fabrications and not true. The public is very concerned about when these precautions will be lifted. Yesterday, a reporter from this newspaper inquired with the French Concession authorities. It was learned that the timing of the removal of these various precautionary measures, such as road closures, will depend on the situation. It is expected that the precautions will be extended until after the "September 18th" anniversary, as this will save some procedures.

### International Rober Cup Tennis Finals China Lost Yesterday US Team Wins Championship After Five Hard Sets Lin Baohua and Wang Wenzheng Lose to Carson

The 1940 International Rober Cup Lawn Tennis Championship unexpectedly fell into the hands of the Americans. The Chinese and American teams continued their unfinished battle yesterday afternoon on Avenue Joffre. First, the Chinese representatives Lin Baohua and Wang Wenzheng easily won the first set 6-3 last week. The second set was also fought to a tie, with each side winning five games. The situation was very favorable, and it was expected that they would be able to avenge their years of regret. Unexpectedly, after yesterday's clash, the second set became a difficult and inseparable situation. As a result, the American side won with a score of 10 to 8, each winning one set. The score was all tied and the American side had the lead at 9 to 8. Unfortunately, in the 18th game, Lin Baohua's serve, which he was very confident in, was lost after two comeback points, which was extremely regrettable. In the third set, each side had three and four, and the American side still had the advantage. When they lost two consecutive games, the American side won again with a score of 6 to 4, and took a 2-1 lead. At the beginning of the fourth set, China and the United States still won the game with their serves. From the eighth game, Wang Wenzheng won the game with a ballistic serve. Lin Wang also broke Carson's very confident serve. Therefore, with a heroic posture of winning three consecutive games, they won back the fourth set with a score of 6 to 4, tying the score at two. In the final deciding set, unexpectedly, the Chinese team had bad luck. Wang Wenzheng's serve was broken by the American side. Carson won three consecutive games. After three to five, it was impossible to save the situation. The United States defeated China 3-2 to win the 1940 International Rober Cup championship.

National Rice Prices Ignore Restrictions Overtly Doing Dark Deals National Rice Has Price Limits But No Limits...Foreign Rice Has Evaluated Prices But Does Not Abide By Them The Rice Market Has Become a Dark World...The Market Soared by Two or Three Yuan Again Yesterday

Yesterday, the foreign rice market was in a chaotic state. Only ordinary broken rice and red rice still had a formal market, opening at 56 yuan. Other goods had become a monopolized situation, and no prices were quoted, all being done through dark deals. Although they claimed to be extremely secretive, if you don't want people to know, don't do it. Yesterday, a customer reported a business to the Public Works Department for disciplinary action. However, speculators were not afraid of the law. Although the market seemed to have stopped invisibly, dark trading was still lively, with a great appearance of secret publicity. No. 1 Saigon fire-milled rice was all priced at 65, 66, or 67 yuan. No. 1 and small fire-milled rice were priced at 62, 63, or 64 yuan. Market prices soared by two or three yuan. Actual sales were only a small embellishment by the shops on this street. The thoughts of merchants and the absorption of transactions and speculations accounted for the majority. At a time when stocks were surging, the rise in rice prices, with the new rice about to enter the market, seemed unreasonable. However, rice merchants and speculators were still fanatical about manipulating and monopolizing the market. Although the Public Works Department has reported them, this trend has not stopped. The original English-Chinese Company No. 1 Saigon exceeded the limit by one and a half yuan, with a dark price of 73 yuan. Subsequently, prices of 74 and 75 yuan were quoted, with various parties using excuses such as the interruption of Haiphong and the inconsistency of pricing to raise prices. In fact, after the Shanghai market rose, orders were close to being placed. As for transportation, it is still open, and goods are arriving continuously. The routes to Siam and Burma have not been blocked. Eight thousand bags of rice were traded yesterday, and the original packaging was three hundred and fifty bags. Most of them were collected by hoarders.

Foreign rice continues to rise in price and continues to arrive in Shanghai. Yesterday, the Panama ship Essl, managed by the Hualun Foreign Company, arrived directly from Saigon with 16,118 bags of rice. It arrived in Shanghai around 7 AM yesterday morning and was unloaded at the French Concession Observatory Wharf and stored in the Taichangxiang and French Post Office Company's new warehouses. In addition, the Yihua Foreign Company's Taisheng ship, which arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday evening, also brought 300 bags from Hong Kong and was unloaded at the Roosevelt Wharf. It is heard that the Shanghai-Vietnam route will soon resume, and Saigon rice will be available in a steady stream. There is absolutely no need to worry about the food supply for the citizens of this city. (Zu)

National rice originally had a price limit, but rice merchants did not comply, and those who tried to ban it could do nothing about it. They pretended not to care. Because national rice had a price limit but foreign rice did not, the price of foreign rice rose step by step at that time, and the price of japonica rice soared in dark deals. Recently, after rice merchants openly evaluated prices, foreign rice had to be evaluated. National rice, which originally had a price limit, could now exceed the limit and no longer be evaluated. As a result, national rice has been soaring in price in dark deals for days because it is not restricted by price evaluations. Foreign rice is also being sold in dark deals, and the authorities can do nothing about it. According to this inference, in the future, both national and foreign rice will either have a price limit but no limits, or have evaluated prices but not abide by them. This is truly, as the Shanghai elder said, "a bit of a farce," and the Shanghai rice market can truly be called a dark world.

Therefore, the national glutinous rice, which was not subject to price restrictions yesterday, saw a resurgence in sales as a result, and prices continued to rise by about two yuan. Jinyue Special was priced at 570 yuan, and Changdan goods were priced at 678 yuan. Hong Kong glutinous rice was similar. Thick and thin japonica and other national rice were frantically sought after in the off-market dark deals. Each price continued to rise by more than two yuan. Changbang fresh and clear japonica was 78 yuan, white japonica was 756 yuan, Changzhou Sukun japonica was 745 yuan, and Nangang original early rice was 745 yuan, with spot at 72.5 yuan to 72 yuan. Only thirty to forty loads of new japonica rice from Zhoupu arrived, and the Qiaotou goods were sold out. At this opportune moment, people were even more enthusiastic. The price of 69 yuan, an increase of two yuan, was sold out in one go. Taicang's new sheep-tip rice was transported by bicycle with eighteen loads, priced at 66 yuan, with spot at 63.5 yuan, also an increase of two yuan. In short, the price of each item continued to rise by two or three yuan. Only foreign rice, due to the evaluation relationship, sellers were unwilling to sell and buyers were not brave enough to buy, resulting in this lifeless and secretly trading market.

### Cannon Car Flour Sells Actively in the North at 17 Yuan

Flour: Yesterday, the flour market showed signs of improvement. It was found that the board of directors of the No. 1 flour factory had not changed. Sales were gradually becoming brisk. As for domestic sales, although the mooncake season was coming to an end, the two factories had reduced their supply by half, inevitably leading to demand exceeding supply. In particular, the Phoenix brand of Japanese flour, which was subject to speculative activities, was the most popular in the market. Because the rice market was stagnant, more hoarders were buying futures flour. Transactions reached 15,000 to 16,000 bags, with September quoted at 15.1 yuan and October at 15.4 to 15.48 yuan, an increase of 0.2 to 0.3 yuan from the previous day. It was also heard that the Green Cannon Car flour was also being inquired about in the North, with nearly 10,000 bags traded at a price of 17 yuan. The market has a promising prospect of recovery.

Wheat: Yesterday, the price also saw a rise. Since the rise in rice prices, although cargo owners have had the determination to persist, they are ultimately bound by the environment and cannot transport the goods into the concession, where Japanese factories suppress prices and collect them. Therefore, the market has no way to develop. Yesterday, the eating board of the Yixin Factory was relatively relaxed. The high-end price for those sent to the factory was 21 yuan to 21.5 yuan, while the middle-end price was still around 21 yuan. The Hua Factory received 25 yuan and 24.8 yuan. However, 152 bags of Taicang wheat that were officially traded for export were priced at 25.5 yuan, a sudden increase of 0.5 yuan from before.

### Finance United States Dollars Resold - Over 1 Million

Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: HSBC's listing remained unchanged. In the unofficial英美 exchange market, there was a slight rebound. Although rumors had no significant positive or negative impact, speculators bought and sold throughout the day, dealing in approximately over one million U.S. dollars. Initially, the opening price was soft, reaching 5.5625 yuan per U.S. dollar. Soon, speculators entered the market to sell, and the price hardened to 5.25 yuan. Later, news arrived about the U.S. warning Japan not to invade the East Indies, and speculators abruptly stopped selling and switched to buying, causing the price to soften slightly. In the after-market, speculators continued to buy and sell actively. The U.S. dollar could be settled at 5.3125 yuan, mainly because Chinese banks had strong appetite. At closing, British gold was at 3 shillings 46.875 pence, and the U.S. dollar at 5.28125 yuan, compared to yesterday's close, the British pound was up 0.015625, and the U.S. dollar was down 0.09375.

HSBC's listing remained unchanged. The silver equalization tax was announced at 0.25% lower. Afterwards, American banks also absorbed September U.S. dollar contracts from speculators at 5.25 yuan. Subsequently, news spread of the strong stance of the U.S. and the East Indies, and operators considered the news positive and switched from selling to buying, causing the price to rebound slightly. It is estimated that speculators entered the foreign banks with September U.S. dollar contracts at 5.21875 yuan, while Chinese banks matched the same month's U.S. dollar contracts at 5.21875 yuan. After 11 o'clock, Chinese merchants resumed selling, and exporters also came to unload, causing the trend to soften again. Exporters sold September contracts to foreign banks at 5.38125 yuan. Before closing, Japanese banks entered foreign banks with 5.25 yuan. As a result, British gold was at 3 shillings 46.875 pence, and the U.S. dollar at 5.28125 yuan, an increase of 0.03125 for British gold and 0.09375 for the U.S. dollar compared to the morning opening.

The shilling was the weakest at 3 shillings 48.4375 pence, but because Chinese banks had a good appetite, the softening trend was缓和. At closing, British gold was at 3 shillings 46.875 pence, the U.S. dollar at 5.28125 yuan, September British gold at 3 shillings 45.3125 pence, and the U.S. dollar at 5.25 yuan.

### Gold Plunges Amidst "Cut Losses"

Yesterday, the unofficial gold market fell sharply from high levels, unable to recover. It initially surged, then suddenly plummeted, with prices nearing the 6,200 yuan mark. News spread that the U.S. government was concerned about British defense withdrawal areas in the city, as well as Vietnam, the Dutch East Indies, and other places, and had warned Japan. As a result, the Japanese foreign exchange market suddenly softened amidst speculators selling 1.5 million U.S. dollars. A "cut losses" trend started in the gold market. Consequently, a certain bank and money exchange company first bought in, rising from the morning opening of 6,380 yuan to 6,405 yuan. However, under the selling pressure from gold firms and two other banks, as well as retail investors selling due to negative news, prices plummeted. In the afternoon, prices continued to decline to a low of 6,180 yuan. Later, due to continuous absorption by Hong Kong-funded gold firms, as well as Chinese banks absorbing foreign exchange, prices softened slightly and short covering began, eventually rising back to 6,135 yuan, a drop of 95 yuan. After closing, the market weakened again. The sentiment of all parties shifted from excitement to fatigue. The total trading volume was over 5,000 taels. Ornament gold fell by 10 yuan to 640 yuan. Guan gold and others remained unchanged.

The Hearsay Gold fell by about 100 yuan

Since the morning, each bar (ten taels) initially reported tight exchange rates and good market sentiment. Gold firms first released 30 taels to banks at 6,380 yuan, 50 yuan higher than the previous day's high. Then, due to banks and money exchange companies joining in, it rose another 25 yuan, reaching a high price of 6,405 yuan, but with very little trading. Later, due to the sudden hardening of foreign exchange, a certain bank suddenly released a large amount of long positions, coupled with gold firms and money exchange companies selling more and buying less, it immediately retreated to 6,320 yuan. Subsequently, another bank slightly bought, briefly rising back 20 yuan. However, because the exchange market continued to soften, a certain bank and gold firms launched another round of aggressive selling, and at this time, leveraged long positions also painfully closed out, falling further to 6,240 yuan. After this, favorable rumors suddenly spread, and foreign exchange stopped softening and tightened slightly. Gold firms and a certain bank switched from selling to buying, and briefly rose back to 6,305 yuan. Unexpectedly, the foreign exchange market softened again at noon, and selling pressure reappeared. Banks and other groups tended to sell off, and before closing, it plummeted to 6,210 yuan, and the closing price was only 6,220 yuan. The initial opening in the afternoon was still good, raising by 10 yuan. Banks released gold firms by 20 yuan, at 6,240 yuan. However, gold firms and banks vigorously sold off, and the exchange market at this time hardened, and the price retreated to the 6,100 yuan level, seeing a low price of 6,180 yuan. After entering, the foreign exchange trend slightly changed, and leveraged long positions took advantage of the low price to add positions, and securities firms also searched for a lot, so it once rose back to 6,240 yuan. However, the result was 6,225 yuan, a decline of 95 yuan compared to the previous day. The full-day fluctuation was 225 yuan. After closing, the off-market situation was weak. Under the vigorous selling by a certain gold firm, it once retreated to the 6,200 yuan level. Finally, six firms at 6,210 yuan purchased. The selling price of cash gold from the current gold firm was ten yuan higher than the hearsay gold, and the incoming reduction was thirty yuan. The current standard gold was more than fifty yuan lower than the listed gold, and there were few openings.

Ornament Gold Also Listed Ten Yuan Lower

The initial conversion price for gold jewelry in silver shops was still 650 yuan for Datonghang. At 10:20, it was listed ten yuan lower. Since then, there have been no changes. It is estimated that Datonghang should change to 640 yuan. The new price of Xintonghang was similar to the previous price, with the incoming reduction around thirty yuan.

The demand for British gold bills was not weak, and the price was very sharp. The price of US gold bills once rose to 19 yuan 8 jiao, but fell to 18 yuan 7 jiao in the afternoon and finally closed at 18 yuan 8 jiao, 4 jiao lower than the previous day.

There was still no lack of suppliers of Japanese gold bills, and the evening market fell to 1 yuan 5 jiao 6 fen.

The price of Japanese gold notes is 1 yuan 1 jiao 1 fen per yuan of national currency.

### Securities - Domestic Debt Rises, With Underlying Factors

The securities unofficial market continued to rise yesterday, but the trend was緩. The shorts had been patient up to this point, thinking that the market price was already high and would fall back, and hoping to wait a moment longer for unexpected changes. However, they did not know that after the Shanghai silver market became extremely loose, there were very few outlets. There were many investors in public bonds, and after being collected by various banks, the circulating chips related to the reserve positions were gradually bought month by month, and became increasingly scarce. The long-awaited large-scale Sino-US loan that has been rumored recently is gradually reaching the hot stage. This kind of loan, which ostensibly aids China, is actually indirectly reducing the opposing forces between the US and the UK. There is a reason for this, and success is not far away. The current trend of public debt already has underlying factors, but it has not yet reached the point of outbreak. A huge涨势 will come later, and it will definitely not collapse midway because it has already risen too much. Yesterday, after a slight fluctuation, it rose again. Type C once again broke through the 4 yuan mark and saw a high price again. Types A and B also saw new high prices. The buyers were mainly Tianfeng, Hongda, Lianhe, and Quanri, who bought in throughout the day. Tongshen, Jiufeng, Wuyuan, and Hengfu also searched for them at any time. No. 41 went into A and came out of C. Lianyih entered first and exited later. Tongkang, Runli, Xinchang, and Shunchang were all selling. Most of the retail shorts have not yet been covered, and there is still much hope for the future. As a result, the market price continued to rise by 2-3 jiao. The total transaction volume was estimated to be about 1.2-1.3 million yuan. A brief table is listed below.

Stock trading: 100 shares of Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company were traded at a price of 14 yuan 5 jiao.

The stock market of the Zhongye Public Institute yesterday had a very good potential. The selling of sellers was particularly difficult and were easily absorbed. Prices did not change much, and the transaction volume was extremely large. Rubber stocks were also stable.

London, 4th (Wednesday) dispatch: Today's listed prices for Chinese foreign debt and Far East British companies' stocks only fluctuated slightly in HSBC bank stocks. HSBC's UK-registered shares fell back by 1.5 pounds, with a price of 65.5 pounds. Hong Kong-registered shares remained unchanged, and the rest were also unchanged.

### Yarn and Cloth Speculators Use Gold and Exchange Rates to Advance and Retreat

The yarn and cloth, which had risen for 18 consecutive days, with 20-count double horse yarn rising by a total of 130 yuan and 5 jiao, saw a slight reaction and declined yesterday. Spot sales remained sluggish, and relying solely on the support of enthusiastic market sentiment, of course, cannot be sustained for long. General speculators will base their advances and retreats on the ups and downs of the gold market. Therefore, with the rebound of foreign exchange and the weakening of gold, the yarn and cloth followed. The fundamental problem is that unless digestion is smooth and 快, the foundation can be consolidated. Currently, cotton yarn has completely turned into gold.

At the opening of the現 yarn market in the morning, countless people were optimistic about the market, and the price of 20-count double horse yarn was 1,025 yuan, rising directly to 1,039 yuan. At this time, scalpers dragged in unanimously, creating a rising situation. Unexpectedly, the exchange rate rose and gold fell sharply. Longs have gradually escaped in secret. The number of chips on the table felt full, and the market turned from rising to falling, and the low price fell to 1,009 yuan. The statistics of the transaction volume in the first half of the day show 2,380 bales, and the closing price was 1,014 yuan and a half, 16 yuan lower than the previous day. There were 110 pieces of yarn shipped to Yantai today. The amount of each帮口 purchased is listed on the left.

### Cotton Merchants Speculating Again

Spot cotton trading has become active again, but most factories absorbed Qiwang at the high prices of the past, so their inventory is still sufficient. Except for a small number of manufacturers with fresher inventories, there is little color, but the industry's thinking on transactions has become more active, so the market is tight.

Ning American seed 219.50 Total 5,500 bales

New reclaimed American 219.00 Also 2,000

The above spot goods are sent to the factory

Another news is that the price of foreign cotton cloth, New York cotton cloth, has been in a stable state these days, and the stock price on Wall Street has soared. Purchases from a part of textile factories are also active. As a result, the closing price increased by another five or six pounds音 compared to the previous day. India yesterday rose again, including forecasts, by more than four rupees.

Shanghai's foreign cotton trading was slightly quieter yesterday due to the fatigue of yarn prices. Although yesterday's transaction was sparse, there were many inquiries and high industry sentiment.

### Piece Goods - Cloth Prices Fall Slightly

The change was very rapid. The sale of coarse cloth was 평, and the twill of fine cloth fell by about 2.5 jiao per piece. The prices of bleached and dyed printed cloth were stable. More than 300 pieces of coarse cloth, fine cloth twill, flannel坯 cloth and bleached and dyed cloth were traded in this street. More than 100 pieces of Zhejiang and Fujian agent, Dangui fine cloth twill, Yihe coarse cloth and other goods, more than 200 pieces of Guangdong and Hong Kong agent, Lunchang colored cloth fine cloth twill coarse cloth, more than 100 pieces of coarse cloth from Yihe and other factories from the northern road Yantai Weihaiwei agent, and thousands of pieces of khaki-colored bleached cloth from the Nanyang agent in the country.

Dong cloth yesterday, due to the lengthening of the foreign exchange and the decline of the standard gold, the white goods leader fine cloth fell sharply due to the floating多傾吐 in the market. The morning closing was 33 yuan, and it dropped again to 32 yuan 7 jiao 5 fen in the afternoon. The price of Four Gentlemen Serge was 9 jiao 3 fen and 2.5 li per yard, and the price of medium-grade fine cloth also fell by 5-6 jiao per piece.

Export - There were 215 pieces of piece goods shipped to Yantai today.

### Miscellaneous Grains - Bean Prices Rise

In the grain market, except for some unpopular declining goods that were tired, other domestic sources were severely restricted, so they were forced to rise, but transactions were unnatural, so business was mostly small. Yesterday, the market price of soybeans and broad beans rose by three or four jiao in the face of the harsh environment. It is estimated that Anqing beans have opened to 33 yuan to 33 yuan 5 jiao, mulberry garden beans are sold at 34 yuan to 34 yuan 3 jiao, Chongming Sand Yellow is 29 yuan 57 jiao, Wujiang Green silkworm (non-selected green) 21 yuan 2 jiao to 9 jiao, Beigang Maojia City Green silkworm 20 yuan 1 jiao, Liuhe Green silkworm 19 yuan 2 jiao to 7 jiao, Pinghu Green silkworm 11 yuan, Anqing small white silkworm 16 yuan to 16 yuan 6 jiao.

### Sugar Market - Domestic Sugar Prices Rise, Winter Fog Qing Follows

The public association劃盤, the spot 14 coarse white outer pile new goods were called 79 yuan, the old goods arriving in June were called 78 yuan, and the goods arriving in April were 77 yuan and a half, but none were traded. Taikoo car white B mark was still 77 yuan 8 jiao, DY mark was slightly loose, 74 yuan to 73 yuan 9 jiao, HX mark September 15 打棧 single 74 yuan to 73 yuan 7 jiao and a half, Dutch red was also soft, 63 yuan and a half to 63 yuan 3 jiao. Domestic sugar was still tight due to a shortage of goods, and 700 foreign packages of newly arrived Dongxiang Red were called 60 yuan. Even the foreign-produced winter fog green was heard to have arrived continuously, and the price was increased by 6 or 7 yuan, but none were traded. It was found that 540 packages of sugar came from Hong Kong yesterday.

### Coal - Indian Coal is Flat and Weak

The business of bituminous coal is still flat and weak, mainly because the inventory in the city is sufficient, the sales are not moving, and the market is difficult to rise, and it is still in a state of lingering. Yesterday, the market had a slight transaction. It is estimated that the Indian Kolkata block of the same industry still shouts 200 yuan for demolition, the ornament block 208 yuan, and the warehouse out of the warehouse, the line product plus.

### Dried and Preserved Goods - Lanzhu Branches Offer New Products

The Lanzhu branches produced in Zhangzhou, because the ships between Gulangyu and others have not been opened, only dozens of boxes of the first batch of goods have arrived, and the foreign expenses are very expensive, so the opening price is very high. Yesterday, the party has opened up and distributed to various industries, and the industry has fixed the price at 230 yuan, with only meager profits.

### Seafood; Raw Starch Steady; Sago Turning Weak

The supply of raw starch is consistent, and sales are also good, so the trend is stable.

### Dredging the River Mouth

The Suzhou Creek in this city, also known as the Wusong River, has been silting up for a long time. At low tide, it is only two to three feet deep, making it difficult for ships to navigate and hindering irrigation of farmland within the mouth of the river. The Dao Xian (county magistrate) has long ordered the Shanghai County and the Foreign Affairs Commissioners to jointly survey the silted river channel from the harbor mouth to the bridge. It is planned to use the machinery of the Manufacturing Bureau to dredge the river, which is estimated to take about four months to complete. Dredging machines and ships have been moved to the harbor mouth, and boatmen have been hired to transport the dredged silt. Dredging began on the eighth day of this month, with dispatched commissioners supervising at all times and supervising officers regularly sitting on ships to supervise carefully, in order to complete the work quickly. From then on, boat owners and farmers will all benefit.

### Buddha in a Clam

The Ten Thousand Buddha Hall in the Xingjiao Temple in Yangzhou City, which was destroyed by fire last year, has now been rebuilt and is brand new! In the past, the hall was inlaid with gold-plated small Buddhas, numbering in the tens of thousands, hence the name Ten Thousand Buddha Hall. Now, it has been slightly replenished. It was heard yesterday that someone donated a clam, about eight inches long, with a total of eighteen Buddha images naturally formed on both sides, with distinct beards and eyebrows. It is now believed that the ancient saying "Buddha in a Clam" is not an empty one. According to the monks, this clam was obtained from the riverbank by a farmer in the northern countryside in the spring. The craftsmanship of nature is truly remarkable!

### After Reading "An Open Letter from Overseas Chinese in the Philippines"

— Sha Tuo

In this newspaper's "Local News" column on the third of this month, there was an open letter from Mr. Li Pingying, an overseas Chinese in the Philippines, to the editor of this newspaper. Although Mr. Li modestly said, "In this letter, there are no brilliant words or outstanding theories," after reading Mr. Li's "open letter," I was deeply moved. Mr. Li's "open letter," as he said, is indeed "every word crafted is the crystallization of my bitter tears!"

As an overseas Chinese, Mr. Li is able to care so much about everything in the motherland. I, who am "residing" in this isolated island, have endless admiration for Mr. Li. At the same time, we thousands of compatriots who are indulging in a life of pleasure on this isolated island should suddenly wake up! We should all read Mr. Li's "open letter"!

Mr. Li arrived in the embrace of the motherland from the distant Nanyang a few days ago. He had long admired the greatness and prosperity of Shanghai, and therefore always wanted to see Shanghai's elegance to fulfill his lifelong ambition. But when Mr. Li stepped into Shanghai, what Shanghai gave to Mr. Li was:

Dancers and prostitutes outnumbered the carp in the Huangpu River; also: guides, gambling dens, salted pork shops; also: hotels and dance halls; also: kidnappings, assassinations; also: bones of those "frozen to death" on the road;... All of this caused Mr. Li's impression of Shanghai to undergo a rapid change, which was—a den of demons!

Therefore, Mr. Li will leave this "den of demons" tomorrow to go to the interior, because Mr. Li hates everything in Shanghai and curses the compatriots in Shanghai, so he does not want to stay in this "den of demons" any longer! I believe that when Mr. Li arrives in the interior, his disappointment with the motherland will definitely be restored, and I also believe that the motherland is growing up and moving towards a new path.

Since Mr. Li's "open letter" is "open," it is obviously not only for the editor of this newspaper. Therefore, as a Chinese compatriot, I would like to offer some explanations to Mr. Li's "open letter."

First: Shanghai is already a fallen land. The name "isolated island" comes from this. Therefore, Mr. Li came to Shanghai, this "den of demons," not to embrace the "motherland." This point, I think, is very important, because Mr. Li is an "overseas Chinese," and Mr. Li's "open letter" will definitely have a great influence on an "overseas Chinese." Therefore, it leads to—

Second: Everything Mr. Li sees is a phenomenon that is bound to exist in a "big city" in modern capitalist society. Guides, dancers, prostitutes, salted pork shops, kidnappings, gambling dens (only assassinations are a unique phenomenon), all of these can be found in all modern "big cities." I believe that the reason why Mr. Li found these sinful phenomena and felt grief and indignation is because Mr. Li regarded Shanghai as the "motherland," and therefore felt extremely disappointed. As I said above, in fact, Mr. Li himself said: Shanghai is only a "den of demons"!

However, Shanghai is different from other fallen lands. I say the above words, but I don't help some people who are indulging in a life of pleasure. I think those people should put Mr. Li's open letter on their desks as a "motto." But here, I only have one sentence to tell Mr. Li and all "overseas Chinese" abroad, that is: "On the one hand, it is lewd and shameless, and on the other hand, it is serious work"! Mr. Li, who stayed in Shanghai for a week, probably didn't see it!

Now, Mr. Li is leaving Shanghai to go to the interior. I think that Mr. Li will not have those unpleasant impressions he got in Shanghai in the interior, so Mr. Li will also be sure: It was a mistake to "come to Shanghai" and wrongly regard it as "embracing the motherland"!

At the same time, I hope that all the compatriots in Shanghai should read Mr. Li's "open letter." If there are shortcomings, correct them; if there are none, be encouraged. Although Mr. Li "curses the compatriots in Shanghai," this is Mr. Li's "angry words." We should thank Mr. Li, because his "open letter" is nothing less than a five-hundred-pound bomb in this muddy and chaotic Shanghai!

Hawthorne's Case

### The Dancer's Destination

— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter 6: A Dangerous Experience

I asked again, "Then, after you came out of the Asia Hotel, did you come directly here?"

Hawthorne said: "No, I wanted to know how your tailing of Yu Gantang was going, and I also expected that you would be puzzled by my sudden disappearance, so I went back to my apartment. Shi Gui told me about your experiences, so I rushed to Changming Lane and met Song Zhaolin."

I said: "Song Zhaolin? Is that the tall, thin guy in the light blue and white striped suit and shirt?"

Hawthorne replied: "That's him. He is a friend of Yu Gantang and told me a lot about Yu Gantang. However, he tried his best to defend Yu Gantang, saying that he had nothing to do with the murder."

Ni Jinshou hurriedly asked, "Do you believe him too? If he has nothing to do with this murder, why doesn't he say a word?"

Hawthorne replied, "Of course I won't completely accept Song Zhaolin's words. It's not a problem that Yu Gantang refuses to speak. However, the most urgent thing at the moment is how to get the person who shot me."

I suddenly had an idea that I suddenly thought of. "Hawthorne, do you think the person who shot you could be Zhao Boxiong? He is also very tall."

Hawthorne hugged his right knee with both hands, looked at the floor, and slowly replied, "This is indeed possible. It's a pity that I never had the chance to take a closer look at his face. I hate myself for being too cautious."

Ni Jinshou said: "If it's him, things will be simpler; otherwise, there will be another person, which will be even more troublesome."

Hawthorne said: "I guess that's definitely not an extra complication. Even if the shooter is not Zhao Boxiong himself, he must belong to his line. You don't need to worry too much."

Ni Jinshou said, "Then, what method do you plan to use to find this Zhao Boxiong?"

Hawthorne frowned and replied: "This has to rely on the power of your officialdom. The first step is to contact the person in charge of the hotel in the name of a civil servant, and then you can carefully investigate the waiters in various departments. If there are still twists and turns in the matter and we cannot start for a while, the second step is to send a few capable detectives disguised as waiters to wait carefully over there." (98)

### The Goldfish's Luck?

— Li Fu

In a wide-mouthed glass tank, there are three or four golden and black goldfish, with a pair of bulging eyeballs, swaying their wide and open tails, leisurely swimming back and forth in a stem of green aquatic plants. Reflected by the water, they appear even more vividly colored, making anyone who sees them have a sense of liking for them. Therefore, not only do noble and gorgeous halls need their embellishment, but also ordinary people's homes and children's earthenware pots and porcelain bowls have their traces. Even the general poor class, who do not have the ability to invite them home, will stand and watch as much as possible when they encounter a goldfish stall on the roadside.

In zoology and everyday legends, it is said that goldfish are a variant of trout. But I have never seen how they changed, and I don't even know how they changed; however, I always think that they used cruel methods like women binding their feet in the past to create such a pair of strange eyes and a wide tail that is not good at swimming. Although the posture is graceful and the appearance is beautiful, and it can make people fall in love at first sight, their innate skills are almost completely stripped away. If they are not protected by people and live in glass tanks or lotus ponds, and they want to use their timid and small bodies to survive in nature, the goldfish family would have become a historical term like dinosaurs, etc. long ago.

Therefore, although goldfish were destroyed in their innate nature, and thus had defects in their skills, they were loved by people, and they were able to live freely in their small world without spending a trace of effort, and they did not have to be afraid and frightened in stormy seas, and they could also proudly say to other fish: "Who among you can ascend to the hall of elegance like me!"

Is this the luck or misfortune of the goldfish?

### Facing a Life of Struggle Theodore Roosevelt

— Translated by Luo Men

Fellow citizens! I advise you that our country does not need a comfortable life, but a life of striving and achievement. If we are lazy; if we only seek luxurious, indolent comfort and ignoble peace; if we avoid the arduous struggles that determine the life and death of people, then people braver and stronger than us will surpass us, and they will seize sovereignty over the world for themselves.

Therefore, let us face a life of struggle, determined to do our duty well and bravely; determined to support justice with facts and words; determined to serve noble ideals honestly and courageously, but with practical methods.

Most importantly, if we believe that struggle is just, then let us not avoid struggle, whether it is spiritual or physical, domestic or foreign; because only through struggle, through arduous and dangerous action, can we ultimately achieve the true goal of national strength.

### Hollywood Women's "Stick Twirling"

— Tao

A Sideline for Extras

There are probably many women in the world who think that Hollywood is an ideal paradise, and that everyone there can immediately become a star. So every year, countless beautiful women go to Hollywood, but in the end, they are all disappointed! Their beautiful dreams become bubbles, and only a few women get a barely-surviving extra position. Because their income as extras is not enough to make ends meet, they have recently come up with a sideline, which is "stick twirling." We often see the "stick twirling" trick in movies, where a person twirls a stick around their body, front, back, left, and right, making various beautiful poses. They have now formed a group, each with a unique costume. They can perform in song and dance scenes or parades in films, and they can also be hired by advertising or publicity companies to earn money. Now this "stick twirling" trick has become very popular, and almost every Hollywood woman is learning it. It may soon become a fashionable exercise tool!

### Yuan Congmei Presides Over in Chongqing

All the staff of the Education Film Department of the China Film Studio are now led by Yuan Congmei, working hard in groups somewhere, and are required to complete the first phase of military education films "Chinese Air Force" and other four films within September, including:

The first group is "Chinese Air Force," with director Li Zhiqing and cinematographers Chen Jiguang, Zhu Shutao, etc., working at air force officer schools, air force sergeant schools, air force machinery factories, and air force units in various locations, and about half of the film has been completed. In addition, the situation of commemorating the "August 14" Air Force Day in various places this year will also be added to this film, and cinematographers sent by "China" to various photography stations are filming separately.

The second group is "Infantry Shooting Education," directed by Yuan Congmei himself, with cinematographers Wu Wiyun and other staff members, preparing to film at the training classes of two central military officer schools and the headquarters of the military academy. The script has been completed and they are rushing to produce storyboards and dialogues, etc., and will start filming on the 10th of this month.

The third group is "Gliders," directed and photographed by Luo Jun, preparing to film the "manufacturing" and "flight" of gliders in various places. They are currently working on writing the screenplay. The outline of the screenplay has been drafted and filming will begin soon.

The fourth group is "Parachutes," with director Zhou Yan and cinematographer, collecting materials and writing scripts in various places. Filming can begin simultaneously with "Gliders" as soon as it is completed.

### Remembering Amateur Performer Shen Kunshan

— Rui Hongchu

Mr. Shen Kunshan, from Wuxing, is only twenty years old, likes Peking opera, and imitates the movements of actors, singing and reciting quite similarly. He studies Qingyi in the Cheng style. When the Silk and Cloth Industry Knowledge Mutual Aid Society was established two years ago, Kunyou joined the Peking Opera group and strived for further study. He hired teachers to teach him plays such as Mei Longzhen, Yutangchun, Visiting Mother, Wujiapo, Joining the Army, Jin Suoji, and Yu Zhou Feng, and his skills improved day by day. His voice is sweet and pleasant, and his pronunciation is clear. His stage presence is sophisticated and delicate, worthy of being a rising star in the amateur world.

An Explanation of "Li Xiangjun"

The stage play "Li Xiangjun" was performed at the theater last month. The play has now been filmed by Jin Xing and is scheduled to be released at the Jin Cheng on the 12th of this month. Here is an interview with the playwright.

The first question——

(Q) How did you write "Li Xiangjun" and what was your motivation?

(A) How did I write "Li Xiangjun"? Because of the themes of The Peach Blossom Fan, as we see them today:

(1) Although the times are different, the environment is quite similar;

(2) There is too much material, and we must select the key points in the treatment. At the same time, it is better to write about the common people than to write about the great men and gentlemen, so the theme focuses on the individual part of Li Xiangjun.

(3) Before processing the material, I first conducted a thorough study of The Peach Blossom Fan itself (including historical research, scene arrangement, and individual character descriptions) before I began to write.

(4) The theme is that even prostitutes value integrity, while Hou Chaozong compromises and surrenders. Through the feelings of separation and reunion, write about the feelings of rise and fall.

The second question——

(Q) What are the differences between stage and film?

(A) (1) On stage, the division of acts and the appearance and disappearance of characters are subject to restrictions, and the material inevitably requires a shortened writing method in time to make the facts before and after connect. That is to say, in order to make the connection before and after, it is necessary to seek its relevance.

(2) In terms of film, it is not restricted by space. What cannot be clearly expressed on stage can be clearly written or inserted separately in the film. In other words, the film is whole, and the stage is partial.

(3) The progress of the plot on stage focuses on dialogue, while the film can incorporate the screen, so that it can take care of everything.

(4) Because many facts in stage plays rely entirely on dialogue to explain, while in movies, all the plots that cannot be seen in plays can be fully performed on the screen.

### A Record of Visiting Xinhua Film Studio

— Shen Jian

It was a muggy and hot afternoon. Through Mr. Lu's introduction, I was able to visit Xinhua's main studio to see the filming. That day, the fourth studio was shooting "Xiao Xiang Autumn Grievances." This film stars Chen Yunshang, Wang Yuanlong, and Hai Xi. When we arrived, they were filming a scene in Wen Yuan's home, where (played by Chen Yunshang) recognized her adoptive father. In this scene, Yunshang performs two kinds of postures, sadness and joy, and it is not easy to change between them in an instant. The performance was very natural, which was very commendable. In this scene, Miss Chen once had the line, "My father, I still don't know where he is, how can I feel at ease?" Miss Chen's pronunciation of the word "heart" was not accurate, and after guidance, although it was slightly corrected, it was still forced.

Originally, they were going to shoot another scene, but because Mei had not arrived, they had to stop filming, so we left the fourth studio.

From the fourth studio to the first studio, there was a distance in between. On both sides of the road, there were all fake houses, cloth shops, hotels, and inns, all kinds of things. From the front, they were very realistic. From behind, there were small pieces of wood crisscrossed, and I didn't know what they were. Seeing this scene, I couldn't help but laugh silently.

In the first studio, they were filming Gu Lanjun's "Cunning Liu Shi." The scene was in Cunning Liu Shi's room, with pearl curtains in front of the bed and bright windows. Under the window was a zither, and next to the zither was a furnace burning incense, and the smoke was fragrant and peaceful. Gu Lanjun played Cunning Liu Shi, and was playing the zither. Someone outside the room heard it and praised it repeatedly. I thought this scene must be a prelude to flirting, and the "scenery" must be "charming" when it is performed later. It's a pity I didn't have the chance to see it. The director of this play is Ma Xuweibang, who is short, stocky, and meticulous. I think "Cunning Liu Shi" will cause a sensation in Shanghai when it is released. It was getting late, so I hired a car and returned home.
