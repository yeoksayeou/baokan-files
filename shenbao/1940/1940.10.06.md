### Britain and America Contact the Soviet Union to Discuss Joint Aid to China; Japanese Authorities Threaten America with War; Pittman Says America Will Not Be the Culprit of Appeasement

London - Reliable sources here reported last night that Britain and the United States are now taking cooperative action to elicit a response from the Soviet Union regarding the military alliance signed between Japan and the Axis powers. It is said that the British and American governments deeply hope that the talks currently underway in Moscow, London, and Washington will lead to joint action by the three countries in the Far East to resist Japan together. Several sources here believe that Stalin is fully aware that the expanded goal of the new tripartite alliance is aimed at the Soviet Union, which was once surrounded by the same alliance. British Foreign Secretary Butler met with Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky at the Foreign Office on Thursday. It is said that the issues they discussed were steps to aid China by the Soviet Union. Previously, Soviet Ambassador Kamensky and U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles had a meeting in Washington, and Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov and U.S. Ambassador Steinhardt also held similar discussions in Moscow. It is reported that the British and American ambassadors have scheduled a joint visit to Molotov this weekend for further discussions. At the same time, British Prime Minister Churchill is said to have decided to announce in the House of Commons next week the British government's decision to open the Burma Road, allowing large quantities of munitions to flow into the Chongqing government. It is reported that sentiment in the House of Commons for aiding China has recently increased dramatically, and plans are underway to send military and economic delegations to Chongqing in the near future to actively implement its planned steps to aid China.

Washington - The White House held a cabinet meeting yesterday that lasted a long time. It is understood that President Roosevelt discussed diplomatic issues with cabinet members, referring to the warnings issued to the United States yesterday by Prime Minister Konoe and Foreign Minister Matsuoka of Japan. (Haitong News Agency, 5th)

Washington - U.S. government officials, members of Congress, and administrative leaders expressed great shock at the remarks made yesterday by Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka during an interview with a International News Service reporter in Tokyo, stating that if the United States participates in the European war or insists on maintaining the status quo in the Pacific, Japan will declare war on the United States. Missouri Democrat Clark stated, "Revealing Japan's official intentions towards the United States allows the U.S. to be prepared to deal with future events. The International News Service has rendered a valuable service. Matsuoka's words are truly astonishing. The remarks made by a responsible official of one country to another government not at war can be considered the most belligerent." Clark also stated, "If Japan does not have the assistance of other countries, it would not dare to independently implement its Far East policy." U.S. President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull were very interested in the International News Service report that aroused national sentiment, but neither was willing to make any criticism.

Honolulu - All reservations for U.S. naval personnel and their families to travel to the Far East on U.S. ships from here and San Francisco have been canceled. Officers of the Asiatic Fleet being transferred to Manila are no longer taking their families with them. Naval authorities have not provided any explanation for this. (Reuters, 5th)

Nanjing - After Japan signed the Tripartite Pact, Prime Minister Konoe, in his first statement to reporters, said that if the United States still refuses to express appropriate understanding and sympathy for Japan's position in the East and continues to regard the military alliance between Germany, Italy, and Japan as a hostile act, then there is no other way but war. Whether there will be war or peace in the Pacific depends on the extent to which Japan and the United States respect each other's interests in the Eastern and Western Hemispheres. Although Japan adheres to the Tripartite Pact, it does not wish to provoke the United States without cause. However, the United States must express appropriate understanding and sympathy for Japan's position in the East as a prerequisite for cooperation. If the United States still refuses to do so and regards this alliance as a hostile act, then there will only be war. Konoe also discussed Japan-Soviet relations in the context of the Tripartite Pact, saying that this pact does not contain any intention of accommodating communism, but he hopes it can reduce the sources of conflict between Japan and the Soviet Union. Japan is now trying to induce the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States to stop aiding Chongqing. (Reuters, 5th)

Nanjing - Japanese Prime Minister Konoe issued an article today supplementing his statement of yesterday, saying that the Tripartite Pact naturally implies that if the United States recognizes Japan's leadership in Asia and Germany and Italy's leadership in Europe, then the Tripartite Pact between Japan, Germany, and Italy will naturally recognize the United States' leadership in the Western Hemisphere. If the United States does not understand the positions of these three countries and considers the Tripartite Pact a hostile act, provoking the three countries, then Japan, Germany, and Italy are prepared to accept this challenge and fight it out. However, if the United States cooperates with these three countries in building a new world order, then these three countries are willing to work together with the United States. Konoe admitted that diplomatic steps are currently being taken not only to co-opt the Soviet Union but also to induce the United States to end its policy of supporting Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek. Konoe stated that the resolution of the Sino-Japanese conflict is now largely being done militarily, but Japan's southward advance is largely economic in nature. Japan's guarantee to French Indochina regarding the stationing of troops in Vietnam under the terms of the local agreement signed on September 22 has now been temporarily reaffirmed with a kind of promise, but this promise is naturally subject to the necessities of military action against China. (Reuters, 5th)

Tokyo - Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka told this agency's reporter yesterday that if the United States participates in the European war or insists on preserving the status quo in the Pacific, Japan will declare war on the United States. This Japanese Foreign Minister, who was educated in the United States, stated at his first press conference since taking office, "If the United States joins the European war, then Japan will be forced to fight its sister country across the Pacific." This Japanese Foreign Minister also said, "I now dare to say one thing to the United States: if the United States is satisfied with recklessness and insists on preserving the status quo, then Japan will inevitably fight it. For us, it is better to be shattered and destroyed than to maintain the status quo." These last two sentences are the first official explanation of the meaning of the Tripartite Pact. Matsuoka also expressed his hope that although the United States is willing to aid Britain, it will carefully consider before plunging the entire world into a fierce catastrophe. From this perspective, it is clear that there must be an explicit provision in the Tripartite Pact that Japan will have to fight if the United States enters the war. Matsuoka also said that Japan keeps its word and will uphold the pact to the end in the name of the nation. "I now frankly state again that the purpose of the Tripartite Pact is to prevent the United States from interfering in the European war. If the United States participates in the war, then the entire world will be plunged into a fierce war of life and death, which everyone fears. We hope to avoid this unavoidable conflict. The Tripartite Pact is an expression of Japan's hope. The American people must know this." Matsuoka expressed great patience towards the United States' attitude and the new U.S. embargo against Japan. Matsuoka said that the embargo is "threatening peace in the Pacific." He also issued a challenge to the United States in clear and unmistakable terms. Matsuoka said, "The United States must recognize the new order in the Far East, otherwise it should be responsible for the war in the Pacific and the world. I have always regarded the United States as my second home. I know that the American people are good and polite people. Today, to know that the United States is the most backward country, insisting on old ideas and trying to hinder those who are trying to improve, is truly heartbreaking. Japan can no longer be restrained. Japan wants to establish a new order of mutual prosperity in East Asia within its sphere of influence and cannot stop suddenly." Matsuoka warned in conclusion, "Japan wants to occupy a place among the world's major powers in establishing a new order for humanity, and this move can never be stopped." (International News Service, 5th)

Tokyo - Reports stating that Foreign Minister Matsuoka made remarks to a reporter from a certain foreign news agency, saying that if the United States aids Britain in participating in the European war, then Japan will declare war on the United States, have today been denied by Foreign Ministry spokesman Suma, calling them absolutely groundless. This Matsuoka has never met with that reporter since taking office as Foreign Minister on September 4. However, Matsuoka did meet with a certain contributor to the well-known American weekly "Liberty," at which time Matsuoka discussed the Tripartite Pact and said, "Read the pact and you will know everything." He also said that if the United States aids Britain in participating in the European war, then Japan would have no choice but to fight the United States, but he continued that he did not even dare to think about such an event. Suma also said that the reporter's manuscript was filled with ambiguous and confusing language. (Reuters, 5th)

Pittman Criticizes Matsuoka for Misunderstanding American Pacifism

A foreign news agency in New York transmitted a statement by Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka to that agency's reporter, saying that if the United States participates in the European war or insists on maintaining the existing situation in the East, then Japan would have no choice but to declare war on the United States. After this news was transmitted, Senator Pittman criticized it, saying that among the statements issued by diplomatic authorities of a major country in recent years, none has been more astonishing and revealing of belligerent intentions. If the report is not mistaken, then Matsuoka's words are truly unfortunate. Matsuoka opposed the United States' adherence to its position of maintaining the status quo in the Pacific and stated in unmistakable terms that if the United States blindly insists on maintaining the status quo in the Pacific, then Japan will wage war against it. Matsuoka's words indicate that Japan will engage in establishing a new order in East Asia by non-peaceful means. Matsuoka truly misunderstands American pacifism. The United States will certainly take any action that can honorably keep it out of the war, but it will never be the culprit of Munich appeasement. Republican Congressman Fish, a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, considered this statement a very important document. Democratic Senator Thomas, who had lived in Japan for many years, said that instability in the Far East has been going on for decades. No one wants to see this situation continue. We want to achieve some understanding and stability. Although U.S. President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull did not discuss Matsuoka's statement, one thing is certain: any threat, whether it comes from Berlin or Tokyo, will have the opposite effect in the United States from what is intended and will instead strengthen the U.S.'s determination to carry out its existing policies. The United States will provide all possible assistance to Britain and its allied countries. In addition, the United States will continue its policy of applying economic pressure to curb aggressor nations. Secretary of State Hull stated today that airplanes ordered by Thailand in the United States will no longer be allowed to be delivered in the future. A batch was delivered in August, but U.S. officials now regard Thailand as a puppet of Japan. Hull paid close attention to the statement from Tokyo by Japanese Prime Minister Konoe that the issue of peace or war in the Pacific depends on the U.S. and Japan respecting and understanding each other's positions. (Reuters, 3rd)

Washington - Senator and Utah Democrat King William stated last night, in response to Japanese Prime Minister Konoe's remarks in Nanjing, and told reporters, "I do not want Konoe or any other boastful Japanese official to overstep their bounds and decide what our government will do. If our country plans to give Britain moral or material assistance so that that country can resist aggressors and totalitarian dictators, what does that have to do with the Japanese? In my opinion, our policy cannot allow boastful Japanese officials to decide for us." (United Press, 5th)

Japanese Public Opinion Hopes for American Understanding of Japanese Policy

Tokyo - Japanese newspapers today prominently featured Prime Minister Konoe's statement yesterday in Nanjing. However, the headlines of Japanese newspapers do not convey any intention of challenging the United States, only saying that if Washington recognizes the goals of the Tripartite Pact between Japan, Germany, and Italy, then Japan is also willing to restore old friendships with the United States. The United States must currently maintain its friendly relations with Japan and recognize Japan's leadership position in the Far East, as well as the goals of Germany and Italy in Europe and Africa. The Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun stated that Japan deeply hopes to join hands with the United States to maintain world peace. The newspaper continued to warn that if the United States does not change its attitude, it will be forced into a whirlpool of war. The newspaper also pointed out that, up to now, the United States has shown no tendency to change its attitude towards Japan. On the contrary, the country has intensified its pressure on Japan, renewing loans to China and expanding the embargo against Japan, which are examples of this. The newspaper also criticized the United States for previously trying its best to reopen the Burma Road in order to continue providing assistance to the Chongqing government. The newspaper finally believed that the recent proposal to organize a joint Japanese-American committee to study the situation in the Far East is too late to change the American attitude towards Japan.

Editorial

### The Axis Powers' Depression

The intention of the alliance between Germany, Italy, and Japan is, simply put, firstly to strike at the opposing countries of China and Britain, and secondly to threaten the United States, forcing it to retreat from difficulties and stop aiding China and Britain. However, based on the developments of the past week, the result seems to be the opposite, because (1) the Chinese authorities have announced a fixed attitude and policy that will never be changed; (2) the British Air Force is becoming more and more valiant in battle, and Germany is gradually abandoning its confidence in winning through air warfare. At the same time, the strengthening of the War Cabinet and the retirement of Chamberlain as Privy Councillor are clear signs of Britain's increasing fighting spirit; (3) the United States' attitude of opposing aggression is becoming more and more distinct. Not only are the attitudes of both the Democratic and Republican parties regarding international policy completely consistent, but even in Congress and public opinion circles, there are even more active proposals for dealing with future threats on both oceans; (4) Furthermore, in terms of the connection between China, Britain, and the United States, it has become increasingly close with the collusion of the Axis powers. Without mentioning that Britain has guaranteed to open the Burma Road as scheduled and the United States has stated that aid to Britain will be extended to Australia and New Zealand, the arrival of the Australian Air Force in Singapore to increase defenses, the widespread rumors in London that Britain will treat China as an allied country, the decision of the U.S.-Canada Joint Defense Board to step up joint defense plans for the Pacific coast, and the proposal by U.S. lawmakers to lease British territories in the Pacific, all of this is sufficient to illustrate the strengthening and expansion of Sino-British-American cooperation. Judging from the above-mentioned signs, it can be seen that the Axis powers' attempt to strike at China and Britain and scare away the United States has completely failed. This is clearly a preliminary setback for the Tripartite Pact.

Although Germany, Italy, and Japan have formed an alliance, they still cannot forget the cheap tactic of "divide and conquer"; therefore, in the alliance, they are still unwilling to openly mix the European war and the Far Eastern war, which is precisely why the three countries are dreaming different dreams and always trying to avoid or delay the confession of "cooperative cooperation." To put it bluntly, Germany and Italy's efforts to win over Japan are by no means intended to help Japan invade China, but are actually intended to encourage Japan to implement a southward advance in order to check Britain and the United States; similarly, Japan's reliance on Germany and Italy is by no means intended to help Germany and Italy defeat Britain, but is merely because the "China Incident" has no way out and the United States' attitude is becoming increasingly tough, so it has no choice but to rely on the power of Germany and Italy, hoping to break the cooperation between China, Britain, and the United States. In such a transaction, undoubtedly, Japan pays the greatest price, while whether Germany and Italy have any gains is fundamentally questionable. As far as Japan is concerned, before forming the alliance, it could still use the guise of "non-intervention policy" to ask Britain and the United States for some small favors. Now that it has cut itself off from Britain and the United States, it should not expect to have any room for trickery; this is the result. On the one hand, there is the danger of losing the American market and suffering a complete blockade, while on the other hand, it is impossible to obtain equal compensation from Germany and Italy: in the future, unless it makes a desperate gamble and aggressively advances southward, it should not expect to find a judgment. However, to advance southward, it must defend the north; to defend the north, it must please the Soviet Union; this is an extremely difficult topic for the Tokyo government. Because, as this newspaper has argued for days, the Soviet Union's understanding of the East Asian war situation is far beyond what the Japanese military can imagine. Moscow will never condone Japan destroying China, taking over the South Seas, and then settling accounts with it itself; the white bear is not as stupid as a pig and will never fail to grasp the small principle of weaving a cocoon around itself and fostering a tumor.

As far as Germany and Italy are concerned, the reason they want to scare off the United States is nothing more than to defeat Britain quickly, but in fact, even if the United States does not fight alongside Britain, the London government under Churchill's leadership may not easily yield. First, Germany's air combat strategy, although it cannot be said to be a complete failure, has at least suffered an unexpected setback; according to the American reports introduced by the former Japanese newspaper's series of articles on the European war, from August 8, when Germany first launched a daytime raid on Britain, to September 16, German aircraft had lost 1,800 planes and 6,000 pilots had been killed or captured, while the British side had lost only more than 600 planes and 290 pilots; moreover, the future climate will be even more unfavorable to the German offensive; the English Channel has only three months of calm seas each year, July, August and September. If we talk about crossing the sea and landing, it is probably more difficult than an air raid; at the same time, Italy's offensive in East Africa has not been very significant recently. Unless the naval situation in the Mediterranean undergoes a dramatic change, making the communication line between the Italian mainland and the East African territories completely free from the threat of the British fleet, the Italian expeditionary force's offensive - at least for the moment - must be particularly cautious. Therefore, for Germany and Italy to win, it seems that relying solely on threatening the United States will be of no avail and they must further open up a way out in the Mediterranean. In other words, they must either find a way to get Spain to participate in the war in order to control the British port of Gibraltar, or they must launch a new adventure in Southeast Europe to change the current strategic situation in the eastern Mediterranean; but as far as the former is concerned, it is highly doubtful whether Spain is willing to "pull chestnuts out of the fire" for Germany and Italy: as far as the latter is concerned, once it involves Southeast Europe, it cannot but take into account the wishes of the Soviet Union. The day before yesterday, shortly after the meeting between the two foreign ministers of Germany and Italy, the two giants themselves personally bothered to meet again, which shows that the two sides have very important issues that need to be discussed urgently. Therefore, in the next few days, the movements of Germany and Italy, especially the relationship between Germany and Italy and the Soviet Union, are the focus of attention.

In summary, it can be seen that the Axis powers each have their own troubles: Japan's difficulty is not knowing how to defend the north and advance to the south, and how to advance to the south without paying a heavy price; Germany and Italy's difficulty is not knowing how to make Britain lose quickly under conditions that do not cause more trouble; these difficulties can eventually be solved, at least for the moment, are extremely depressed and have absolutely no certainty; and it is very possible to get the opposite result.

### Thai Government's Land Demands Rejected by French Government; Both Sides Deny Incidents on the Border; Japanese Aircraft Arrive at Vietnamese Airfields

Hanoi - French officials have just admitted that no new incidents have occurred on the Thai border and denied accepting new demands from Thailand. The leader of the Thai delegation to Vietnam, Pala Sila, told a United Press reporter that his country only demanded the expansion of the border to natural boundaries and also claimed that his country also demanded Laos province. Ba Shi also said that he did not know of any incidents on the border and that his country would not resort to force. (United Press, 5th)

Vichy - The French government has rejected Thailand's request to adjust the border of French Indochina. Twenty Thai aircraft, followed by thirty, flew over the Mekong River on Tuesday, and Thailand has also increased its border defense forces. However, the French government believes that this demonstration is not serious, but is merely a move to promote land concessions. This move is related to the Thai ambassador to France submitting the land request drafted in Bangkok half a month ago to the French government on Sunday. In its response, the French government merely reiterated its previous views, informing it that France is prepared to implement the agreement established on June 12 allowing Thailand to enter and exit the Mekong River, but does not want to discuss the Vietnamese border issue with Thailand.

### US Urgently Needs to Adopt an Active Policy: Stahle, American Talks

New York: Stahle, publisher of the Shanghai Great American Evening Post, told reporters in New York yesterday that Japan is overvalued by the world. However, Japan's cunning leaders know their strength. Japan is actually a fifth-rate country, and its main weapon is "intimidating bluff." The United States urgently needs to adopt an active policy. If necessary, it should use force to stop Japan's aggression. If Japan believes that the United States is determined and knows that continuing its aggression will lead to war, then Japan will restrain itself, and the United States will not have to fight it. The United States should help China and Britain today, and China and Britain will bear the majority of the war. If the United States hesitates and waits, it will have to fight alone in the future, or even fight against both China and Japan. Stahle continued, although he was ordered to be expelled by the Wang regime, he still plans to return to Shanghai next year. The Wang regime has not received any great support, and a strong and independent China is obviously a necessary condition for the United States' security. (5th Reuters dispatch)

### Rumors of Secret Clauses in German-Italian-Japanese Agreement: Far More Important Than What Was Published

London: A senior responsible diplomat, neither American nor Chinese, but who is very attentive to Far Eastern affairs, recently told a United Press reporter that the German-Italian-Japanese agreement contains secret clauses that are far more important than what was published. The secret clauses include: (1) Germany and Italy promise to use their influence after the war (assuming they win) to help Japan annex the Dutch East Indies and Vietnam; (2) Germany and Italy are prepared to mediate the Sino-Japanese War to achieve a peace favorable to Japan; (3) Germany promises to do its best to engage in diplomatic and political mediation to bring Japan and the Soviet Union to a friendly understanding and to establish a treaty of non-aggression. The above three are all favorable to Japan, but they must be conditional on an extremely important fourth clause. This fourth clause stipulates a date for Japan to join the European War and, at the same time, participate in Germany's intensive attack on Britain's blitzkrieg and the German-Italian joint attack on Egypt and the Near East. It is generally believed that the main purpose of the meeting between Hitler and Mussolini at the Brenner Pass yesterday was to determine the date for the simultaneous implementation of the blitzkrieg by these three powers. It is also generally felt here that if the Burma Road continues to be blocked, it will prompt Chongqing to accept German mediation and lead to a Sino-Japanese peace. However, Britain's decision to reopen the Burma Road on October 17 is due to recent American aid, and British aid to China can also make General Chiang Kai-shek firm in his determination to continue the war of resistance without being subject to German mediation. Far Eastern experts also recall that in the autumn of 1938, the German Ambassador to China engaged in mediating the Sino-Japanese War without success. London and Washington are well aware that the Germans want to bring Japan and the Soviet Union into harmony and bring the Soviet Union closer to the three-power alliance, but many believe that even if Japan and the Soviet Union conclude a treaty of non-aggression, it is not of great importance because: (1) Japan has no interests in the Soviet Union; (2) Moscow has always suspected that the three-party agreement is ultimately aimed at the Soviet Union; (3) Soviet people feel that it is more beneficial to unite with Britain and the United States in the Far East than to conclude an unreliable treaty between Japan, the Soviet Union, and other competing ambitious people.

### US Congress to Adjourn Soon

Washington: Texas Democratic Congressman Rayburn told people after consulting with President Roosevelt yesterday that Congress will adjourn starting on Tuesday until November 18, after the presidential election, before reconvening. Rayburn said, "I also believe that at this time, the President will not submit any proposals regarding national defense to Congress." According to reports, the US Congress has completed the discussion of all important national defense cases that should be discussed this week. (5th United Press dispatch)

### Germany, Italy, and Japan Organize Joint Technical Committee: Divided into Economic and Military Groups

Tokyo: After Germany, Italy, and Japan recently signed a military alliance treaty, they immediately began to organize joint technical committees in Tokyo and Berlin. Each committee is divided into two groups: one is the economic group, which specializes in studying the common economic facilities of Europe and Asia. The Japanese side has appointed Wutang, the head of the Japan Industrial Club, as the leader of the group; the other is the military group, which specializes in discussing the military liaison matters of Germany, Italy, and Japan. It is reported that the three countries have begun to send representatives to the two committees (the first meeting will be held at the end of this month). (4th Havas dispatch)

### Results of German-Italian Summit: New Resolutions on Military and Diplomatic Affairs, Recognizing the Inseparability of Europe and Africa, Hinting at Amazing Performances Soon

The special train of the German head of state Hitler departed for Germany yesterday afternoon, and minutes later, the special train of the Italian Prime Minister Mussolini also departed for Rome. (5th Haitian dispatch)

Berlin: According to an authorized statement issued by the official news agency, a broad hint was made regarding the discussions between the two dictators at the Brenner Pass meeting, stating that the Axis powers are determined to continue their far-sighted policies in the diplomatic and military spheres until the collapse of Britain. The issue of Greater Europe is inextricably linked to Africa, and the Axis powers' decision is based on this goal. (5th Reuters dispatch)

Rome: According to authoritative sources, Hitler and Mussolini's meeting at the Brenner Pass has finalized the winter military plans for the German army to accelerate its attack on Britain and the Italian army to attack Egypt. Well-informed sources said that the Italian army will soon launch a large-scale offensive against Egypt, and the Germans will also order their troops to land in Britain. At the same time, a total attack on the entire British Empire will also occur. It is also said that Aden and Gibraltar will be attacked simultaneously at that time. During the Brenner Pass meeting, General Keitel, the chief of staff of the German High Command, also attended, which indicates that the meeting must have discussed military technical issues. It is reported that among the issues discussed by the German and Italian leaders and Keitel was the participation of the Italian army in the German army's attack on Britain. The "Massaggero" newspaper stated that the decisions of the German head of state and the Italian prime minister will inevitably lead to resolute steps in the near future. (5th United Press dispatch)

Berlin: Authoritative sources here declared that Hitler and Mussolini, in their three-hour meeting at the Brenner Pass, have established important military and diplomatic resolutions. German newspapers mentioned the meeting between Hitler and Mussolini at the Brenner Pass on March 18 of this year, when there were various speculations about the outcome of the meeting, but there was soon a manifestation of facts, namely the German spring offensive and Italy's participation in the war. Yesterday's Brenner meeting will also produce equally important results. Dr. Meger, a diplomatic correspondent of the Berlin "Financial Times," which is known for its well-informed sources, declared that the German Chief of Defense Staff Keitel also participated in the meeting between Hitler and Mussolini, implying that Germany and Italy have decided to strengthen the war against Britain, leaving it no room to breathe. (5th Haitian dispatch)

Berlin: German newspapers hinted last night that since the meeting between Prime Minister Mussolini and Chancellor Hitler at the Brenner Pass yesterday, "drastic changes" are expected for Britain. The German newspapers also recalled a similar meeting held at the Brenner Pass last spring, which was the prelude to the collapse of France. According to well-informed sources here last night, the main matters discussed at the recent meeting of the leaders of the two Axis powers were the military issues that should be resolved before the start of the general attack on Britain. According to a German official, the German attack on Britain is expected to begin at the same time as the attack on France last spring. In addition, this new offensive policy is to fulfill the conditions of the Three-Power Military Agreement and to open up a road to build a "new order" in Europe, Africa, and Asia. (5th United Press dispatch)

London: Hitler and Mussolini's sudden meeting is probably a harbinger of the Axis powers' resumption of the "peace offensive." Some people believe that this is not impossible. Hitler and Mussolini's meeting at the Brenner Pass may be intended to strengthen the Axis powers' superficial unity and use it to continue to intimidate Britain, wanting to make Britain prepare for peace talks. However, regardless of whether the Axis powers will launch a peace offensive, there are several things that can be inferred. Germany has concluded an Axis Agreement with Japan, and there are rumors of seeking cooperation with the Soviet Union to back the German-Italian-Japanese alliance, and there are also plans to induce Spain to join the war. Now, the German-Italian meeting is being held. All of this shows that Germany now realizes that it is in a dead end. Hitler has repeatedly told the world that Germany can defeat Britain on its own, but the war against Britain has now failed, so there is a need to seek allies to help it resume its attack. Just as when a patient's condition worsens, the doctor will suddenly consult and plan a new treatment method that is slightly more intense. The Hitler-Mussolini meeting will inevitably carefully review the Axis powers' war efforts. If the peace offensive fails to materialize, then one of the following four routes will be chosen: (1) Direct invasion of Britain. Although the German General Staff is skeptical of this, Hitler still hopes to give it a try. (2) Direct attack on Gibraltar and North Africa via Spain. (3) The Italian side will launch another major offensive against Egypt, or it will be carried out under German supervision. (4) Advance troops through the Balkans, but the Soviet Union may object to this. There is reason to believe that Hitler is deeply dissatisfied with Mussolini's failure to establish naval hegemony in the Mediterranean, but Mussolini is also easily countered with the fact that Hitler's plan to attack Britain has not been realized.

Germany and Italy Deny Peace Rumors

Berlin: A German foreign spokesperson declared today that Germany is prepared to continue the war in order to achieve a final victory. All rumors that the Axis powers are planning to take peace actions are British propaganda and not credible. (5th Haitian News Agency dispatch)

Rome: A senior official here recently made a statement to foreign reporters that German Chief of Staff General Keitel also attended the meeting between German head of state Hitler and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini at the Brenner Pass. This point alone can disprove the rumors that the Axis powers will propose peace suggestions. (5th Haitian News Agency dispatch)

Yugoslavia Expresses Fear

Belgrade: Hitler and Mussolini's meeting at the Brenner Pass yesterday has made people here even more anxious about the Axis powers' future actions. Political circles here deeply believe that this meeting will cause accidents in Southeast Europe and involve Yugoslavia. National officials expect the Axis powers to take diplomatic and military offensives against Britain in the eastern Mediterranean, which will focus on Greece because Greece refuses to cooperate with the Axis powers.

### Spanish Minister of Interior Leaves Italy to Return Home: Foreign Minister Ciano Sees Him Off, Chatting Harmoniously Along the Way

Rome: Spanish Minister of Interior Suhner departed from Rome's Littorio Airport at 10:27 this morning to fly to Madrid. First, Ciano and Suhner rode in the same car from the Madama Village to the Littorio Airport. The two chatted about the political situation for 45 minutes in the car, which was quite speculative. 5th Haitian News Agency dispatch)

Madrid: Spain is now quietly awaiting the outcome of the Brenner Pass meeting. According to reports from Rome, the meeting has no conspiracy against the neutral countries, but the Rome correspondent of the Spanish Efe News Agency believes that Spain will definitely be mentioned in the meeting. Given the fact that Spanish Minister of Interior Suhner planned to meet with the Italian Foreign Minister before returning to his country, it can be seen that the above speculation is quite reasonable. According to the majority of people in Spain, their attitude towards the war has recently changed greatly. Those who believed that Britain could only support for two or three weeks after the collapse of France have now changed their minds and believe that Britain will be able to achieve final victory.

### American Reporter Observes the Situation in the Far East: After the Reopening of the Yunnan-Burma Road, a New Crisis Will Occur

Washington: Scripps Howard Newspapers reporter Hem recently warned the United States that by reopening the Burma Road, the United States will be drawn into a dangerous situation in the Far East. Hem said that the new crisis in the Far East, which occurred in mid-October and which may lead the United States there, may not be a surprise in Washington. Hem pointed out that this crisis is the result of the reopening of the Yunnan-Burma Road, because the Japanese will definitely take hostile actions and retaliatory measures against it. According to observers, if this road is reopened, it may easily drag the United States into a dangerous vortex. According to various sources, after the November election, the United States may accept the proposal to lease Singapore for joint use by Britain and the United States. (5th United Press dispatch)

### United States Withdraws European Fleet

Washington - The Navy Department announced last night that it has disbanded the U.S. fleet that has been serving in European waters since the Spanish Civil War. This fleet includes the cruiser USS Omaha and two destroyers. These warships will soon return to the United States. Informed sources say the Coast Guard cutter Campbell will sail to Europe to replace the withdrawn fleet. Naval circles say the withdrawal of the European fleet is because the two destroyers in Europe are very similar in appearance to the warships recently sold by the U.S. to Britain, which could easily lead to misunderstandings and incidents.

### Clouds Obscure the Sky, German Planes Bomb London Again, British Planes Engage, Intense Anti-Aircraft Fire, Numerous Fires Break Out North of the Thames

London - Last night and this morning, single and small formations of German bombers, hindered by dreaded anti-aircraft fire, hid above the clouds, dropping bombs indiscriminately like rain, causing sixty locations in central London, greater London, and southeastern England to suffer indiscriminate bombing. The most notable feature of the recent German air raids on London is the accuracy with which London's anti-aircraft batteries detect German planes above the clouds. The German planes' movements were constantly hampered by exploding shells. Official sources report that although bombs fell in southeastern England and London, casualties were light in both areas, and material damage was slight elsewhere, with few deaths or injuries. Fires caused by incendiary bombs were quickly extinguished. Yesterday, one German bomber was shot down, making the ratio of German to British losses three to one. It is learned that British bomber squadrons did not sortie last night due to exceptionally poor weather over enemy territory. (Reuter, 5th)

London - An Air Ministry communiqué declared that, according to current information, fifteen German planes have been shot down in today's battles over Britain. (Reuter, 5th)

London - British Spitfire and Hurricane fighters spent the entire day yesterday searching the skies over southeastern England for German bombers that were flying in separately and hiding in the clouds. Although the search was difficult, many German planes were still found, leading to aerial combat. British fighters shot down at least five German bombers, and two were definitely seen to crash. Yesterday morning, a British fighter patrolling the clouds off the coast of East Anglia suddenly spotted a Junkers Ju 88 German bomber 100 yards away. It immediately opened fire, killing the rear gunner, and the German plane dived into the clouds. The British plane followed closely, strafing it three times. The German plane's dive slowed, and the British plane continued to pursue until it saw the German plane crash into the sea. Subsequently, two British fighters pursued a Junkers Ju 88 over the south coast and shot it down into the English Channel. (Reuter, 5th)

Berlin - Today's German military communiqué stated that the German Air Force, under the command of General Sperrle, attacked military installations in and around London yesterday, causing numerous fires north of the Thames and in the northern suburbs. German planes also bombed ports, factories, arsenals, oil depots, train stations, and aircraft factories in eastern, southeastern, and central England. The explosions were very loud, and smoke filled the air. An airfield near the St. George's Channel was destroyed, and many planes on the ground were damaged. Yesterday and last night, no enemy planes flew into German airspace. Besides an unknown number of enemy planes destroyed on the ground, five enemy planes were lost yesterday, the same number as German losses. (Haitong Press, 5th)

### Roosevelt Declares Aid to Britain Policy Will Be Intensified, Exposes German-Italian Plot to Influence U.S. Election, Canadian Pilots to Train in the U.S.

Washington

President Roosevelt, while receiving journalists yesterday, foreshadowed a greater adjustment of the Anglo-American military standards, and said that Canadian aircraft pilots not affiliated with the Canadian military could be trained in private aviation schools in the United States this winter. When asked if there was reason to believe that Germany and Italy were trying to make him fail in the presidential election, Roosevelt read a news item from Rome in response. According to the Rome news, the Axis powers are now doing everything they can to make Roosevelt lose the election. This is not a plan to interfere in the internal affairs of the United States, but because Roosevelt's foreign policy and his steadfast claims, the Axis powers have no choice but to do so. The Axis powers want to prevent the United States from joining the war and limit American aid to Britain to a minimum. If this goal can be achieved, it will greatly help the Axis powers. That is why the Axis powers must take action before November 5th to greatly affect the election campaign. When asked whether the United States will provide Britain with all kinds of assistance other than war as previously stated, the President replied that everything is being rushed, the sooner the better. It is not accurate to say that Britain is not currently receiving all kinds of assistance except war, but he cannot comment on specific items. When asked about the Japanese report that Secretary of State Hull will resign in the New Year, the President replied that this was just another rumor. The story that U.S. Ambassador to Britain Kennedy will resign and be replaced by U.S. Ambassador to France Bullitt is also the same. (Reuter, 5th)

Washington - A former member of the German-American Bund in New York City has testified before the House Committee on Un-American Activities that members of the Bund are being trained for an eventuality in order to organize a government similar to Germany's to take over the United States.

### Spy Mania in Europe and America

Regarding the activities of German spies and plainclothes agents in various countries, this newspaper has already translated and published a report by U.S. Secretary of the Navy Knox. Here is another translation of reports from an "Atlantic Monthly" European correspondent and U.S. Bureau of Investigation Director Hoover.

Although the Scandinavian countries are known as "democratic nations," the Nazi party is extremely active. The incident of the German transport ship Alma Mack being sunk by a British ship in Norwegian waters was an eye-opener. The fall of Denmark and Norway was really a victory for German spies. Denmark has long been known as a beehive of spies. If one understands that the South Jutland area has 30,000 German minorities due to the provisions of the Treaty of Versailles, this situation is not surprising. The Danish authorities have repeatedly warned people not to engage in ship transactions with any foreign nationals, which is really their only way to ensure the safety of ships. Sweden has received special attention from General Göring, whose first wife was Swedish, and he maintains a close relationship with Sweden. Official Swedish reactions or any attempts can hardly escape Göring's notice. Sweden is also filled with Soviet spies everywhere.

Norway is also a country where spies are concentrated, and most of them are active along the coast. Most of them are German consuls, who were still sending coded radio messages until their arrest.

Clues to Norwegian espionage activities have been discovered as far back as 1936. At that time, Major Quisling, as Minister of the Army, used his position to first buy off the Navy, then the Army, and finally police officers and civil servants for his own use. He used this strategy to create cells of Nazi plainclothes agents in Norway.

The Nazi party's youth movement in Norway was initially just a means of enticing others, but it later aroused the suspicion of the Norwegian authorities, who arrested and deported several members. The German embassy immediately issued a statement acknowledging hundreds of tourists, which startled the Norwegians, who dared not interfere any further. In the final stages, the only mistake made by German spies was not sinking the "Blücher," allowing the Norwegian King and government to escape the country. Other than that, the Nazi party's activities were flawless.

The discovery of espionage activities in the Netherlands occurred before the German invasion, when several Dutch military officers and Dutch Nazi secret members were arrested, and the Dutch defense plan was found in their possession, ready to be handed over to Germany. There were a total of 20,000 Dutch Nazis. As for how many Dutch army and police uniforms were smuggled into Germany so that German plainclothes agents could disguise themselves and assist the German army in occupying the Netherlands, it may forever remain a mystery.

The arrests of Hoven, an official of the Dutch Ministry of Social Affairs, and Boof, an official of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, proved that there were also Nazi conspirators in the Dutch government. The two men were accused of providing Germany with information on ships departing from the Netherlands, both domestic and foreign, leading to the sinking of many ships. The names of various countries were also found in Hoven's home, and the reason for this is now very clear. He selected many Germans, trained them, and had them live in neighboring countries in order to maintain contact with the paratroopers. These people were another force in Germany's conquest of neighboring countries.

According to the same plan, several thousand Germans have also moved into Yugoslavia. Yugoslavia is extremely concerned about these people.

German spies in the Netherlands also included women. These women fall into the following categories:

(1) Wives, daughters, and nieces of German residents. The term "nieces" has a particularly broad meaning here.

(2) German women who married Dutch men and still worked enthusiastically for Germany, often persuading their Dutch husbands to become pro-German.

(3) Single women, similar to female students, engaged in commercial activities, working as hotel waitresses, companions, band members, or artists in dance halls.

(4) Serving as maids and housekeepers, most of whom are very capable and highly educated.

These female plainclothes agents all fulfilled the duties of landlords for the German paratroopers. They used signals to indicate aircraft, guided the paratroopers to land, and then contacted them, leading them to important strongholds. They also supplied the paratroopers with various clothing, provided them with various guidance, and supplied them with various information.

The Mata Hari-style female spies of the past are no longer fashionable, and they have been replaced by well-trained, alert, and experienced female spies trained by Hitler.

In the early stages, the Nazi party in Norway used cultural societies, sports clubs, youth leagues, and tourists as cover, and later recruited important figures from civil servants, the legal profession, the church, the news media, and the business community. Politicians were not recruited. Adventurers were also not very welcome, only solid members were recruited. Therefore, the most effective members of the German plainclothes agents were those who were the least noticeable. Among them, the editor of "Free People," Rieffert, currently represents German Propaganda Minister Goebbels as the head of the Oslo press censorship office.

The second phase of the development of the Norwegian plainclothes agents was in 1938. At that time, Nazi spies, disguised as diplomatic counselors, journalists, salespersons, merchants, business managers, lecturers, refugees, exiles, etc., sneaked into Norway to carry out activities. These people had to be welcomed in society and have a position in their profession. Among them, Major Spindler served as an attendant to King Haakon of Norway. After these spies penetrated Norway, they united with local plainclothes agents under the protection of the German consulate. They worked together in strict secrecy, initially with only a few hundred people, and later with several thousand, conspiring to rebel. German spies who leaked secrets were executed, so most of those Germans were people who did not drink alcohol and could keep their mouths shut.

The third phase was in the six weeks before the actual German occupation of Norway. At that time, a large number of young German travelers poured into Norway and searched for the names of the other twenty co-conspirators who held high positions.

Before the Netherlands was invaded, it did not carry out large-scale espionage eradication work. The Dutch Communist Party was more powerful than the Norwegian Communist Party. The Dutch Nazi leader, Marcel, was also more important than Norway's Quisling. Although the Netherlands had implemented martial law a few weeks before the invasion and subsequently rounded up spies, in reality, those arrested were only a drop in the bucket. The exact number of German plainclothes agents is unknown, but it can be asserted that there were at least 20,000 members of the Dutch Nazi party, not counting an equal number of German expatriates.

The job of these plainclothes agents was to spread rumors throughout the country that Britain and France would violate the neutrality of the Netherlands. Marcel used the excuse that every Dutchman should have freedom of speech or writing, and continued to act freely without being arrested. Before the German invasion, these plainclothes agents did not even lift a finger. The fall of the Netherlands has proven to be the result of the entire country being filled with German plainclothes agents. Dutch Foreign Minister Kleffens once said that two days before the German invasion, an important banker in Amsterdam was searched, and the entire plan of the Dutch government to flood the entire country by digging dikes was found. The truth has now been revealed that the person who directed the plainclothes agents to defeat the Netherlands was a little-known counselor in the German embassy named Düding.

Hitler's relocation of Germans to neighboring countries and the large number of Nazi spies active in Belgium had already caused a serious conflict between King Leopold of Belgium and the Belgian Nazi Rexist Party before the German invasion. The Belgian Nazi Party had at one time made a special effort to win over Belgian military officers. Therefore, a Captain Tombalay in the Belgian military informed German spies of the entire Belgian defense plan.

The Rexist Party made every effort to hinder the Allied forces. Zembello, who was arrested in Chabro, was the leader of the spies in that area, and was entirely responsible for spying on the British and French forces on the Belgian border for Germany, often providing the information he obtained to German mobile spies.

Although King Leopold of Belgium tried his best to maintain neutrality, the Lexkist Party tried to drag Belgium into the war. Before the German invasion, Belgium did not have strict preventive measures, but several effective actions were also taken, such as establishing concentration camps to detain Lexkist Party members, communists, and German refugees. The management of these concentration camps and the prisoners inside was very special. German Catholic refugees were managed by the Belgian Catholic Party, German Socialists were managed by the Belgian Socialist Party, and German-Austrian Jews were managed by various Belgian Jewish groups. After the outbreak of war, Belgium immediately encountered the problem of 400,000 foreigners residing within its borders, accounting for five percent of the country's total population.

### Food: No Problem for Foreign Rice to Arrive in Shanghai, Rice from Hong Kong Continues to Arrive, Foreign Rice Prices in the City Fall Again, New Early Rice Arrives Vigorously, Kiln Rice Also Seen New

After the rice market showed a fluctuating situation the previous morning, yesterday, the arrival of new early rice via rickshaws continued and a large number of river boats arrived, not less than 4,000 piculs. In addition, new early kiln rice from Qingjiao also made its first appearance on the market, not less than 150 piculs, causing an oversupply of new goods and a large and significant drop in prices, falling by as much as four or five yuan. The new early rice opened at 76 yuan, Taicang mutton tip at 62-63 yuan, Qingjiao du tip at 66 yuan, and then to 64.5 yuan. However, the opening price of kiln rice was comparatively higher at 88 yuan. The prices of other thick or thin and broken rice fell by two or three yuan without exception. Changbang early rice was only 90 yuan, Su early rice 87-88 yuan, and Nangang early rice 88.7 and 88.5 yuan. Glutinous rice also fell by one or two yuan, Jinli special at 72 yuan, and Changdan goods at 71 and 70 yuan, similar to Hong Kong glutinous rice. Foreign rice, therefore, struggled weakly. General floating traders massively released their goods, and all prices fell by one yuan. No. 1 Saigon was 73 yuan, No. 2 67 yuan, No. 2 Siamese 65 yuan, small wring 64.5 and 64 yuan, and the early market once plunged sharply, with the lowest price for small wring being only 63.2 yuan and No. 2 early rice at 64 yuan. However, the overseas quoted price for Saigon No. 2 telegram was still around 79.5 yuan, and importers were afraid that the Shanghai market would be too small and did not dare to ask. Some firms absorbed the rice because the overseas price was not small and few new orders had been placed. Therefore, the afternoon market turned around, and afternoon saw a recovery of five or six corners. Anglo-China Corporation original packages were returned to the market because the goods owner believed that the overseas price was high and the cost was not low, so they insisted on throwing out the goods at the original plate of the previous day. Importers thought the price was too high, so no original packages were sold all day. It is estimated that more than 4,000 packages of foreign rice are on offer.

The arrival of foreign rice in Shanghai is very vigorous. The arrival dates have been reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that the Danish ship Heinrich Jessen, managed by the Jardine Matheson Company, arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday (4th) with 4,576 packages from Hong Kong and stopped at the Jardine Matheson Wharf in Pudong to unload. Yesterday, the company's Jiangsu ship arrived in port, carrying 6,791 packages from Hong Kong. In addition, the Taiyuan ship also loaded 7,059 packages from Hong Kong and stopped at the company's warehouse in Pudong to unload. It is said that a large batch of foreign rice is waiting to be loaded in Saigon to be shipped to Shanghai. It is said that although Japanese troops have entered Vietnam, the Japanese army has no right to interfere with commerce, so there is no problem for foreign rice to arrive in Shanghai. (Zu)

### Authorities Prevent Price Hikes, Current Factory Prices Still Fixed

Flour: Yesterday's market was secretly tight as usual. Since Hua Factory flour has been actively sold to customers, the supply to this market has been decreasing day by day, and the factories have been increasing the prices. The authorities have prevented price hikes, so the factories have continued to maintain the original prices for the time being and have not increased them. However, the retail flour shops in this market all have limited supplies from the factories, and most have no goods to sell. The old brand name warehouse receipts have secretly hardened by one or two corners. The quoted price for foreign flour is slightly higher than before, with the total price being 17.23 yuan. A large amount of foreign flour is awaiting arrival, and people's hearts have not yet declined, so foreign flours such as Pagoda Double Eagle brand are still selling for 18.5 yuan, comparable to the customer price of Hua flour. It is said that customer sales are continuing to move slightly.

Wheat: Yesterday's market did not make any progress. There are nearly 1,000 packages of goods arriving by truck every day, but they are all designated for delivery to Japanese factories. The receiving price is still only around 21 yuan. Hua factories and other sales channels have no goods to receive at all, so the market has returned to calmness.

### Finance: Foreign Exchange Supply and Demand Adequately Offset

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no changes in the HSBC exchange rates. The unofficial market for the British and American currencies was exceptionally stable, with minimal fluctuations. Speculators continued to maintain a long-term outlook, focusing on selling rather than buying. However, major foreign banks like the Chinese banks and American banks showed strong demand, initially balancing supply and demand. At noon, news spread that the United States would withdraw Far East oil merchants, a move related to Japan. Speculators interpreted this as negative news, leading to increased selling. Consequently, the US dollar traded actively at 5.5625 yuan. However, by the afternoon close, prices had recovered to level. The British gold closed at 3 pence and 5.5625 shillings, and the US dollar closed at 5.53125 yuan, showing no significant change from the previous evening close for either currency. The market was closed on Saturday afternoon.

Negative News Persists

In the early morning, the London exchange rate was significantly lower, nearly falling by 0.0625. The silver price in New York remained stable. The London gold price was steady. The exchange rates between the British pound and the US dollar, as well as Shanghai currency, were stable. The US dollar exchange rate was slightly higher against the British pound and slightly lower against Shanghai currency. There was no market for the French franc. The central bank's exchange rates remained unchanged. At the opening of the bank's spot market, the selling price for British gold was 3 pence and 5.5625 shillings, and the US dollar was 5.53125 yuan, showing no change from the previous day's close for both currencies. After the opening, the market was calm and stable. Chinese banks, mainland banks, and American banks, such as Chase, sold US dollars for this month at 5.53125 yuan to speculators. At the same time, HSBC bought Shanghai spot US dollars from Chinese banks, also at 5.53125 yuan. The HSBC exchange rates were announced and remained unchanged. The silver balancing tax was also announced with no changes. Subsequently, Chinese banks and speculators sold aggressively, causing the market to harden and some negative rumors to circulate. Shanghai foreign banks sold US dollars for this month at 5.53125 yuan, and speculators sold US dollars for this month to foreign banks at 5.5625 yuan. They also sold US dollars for the next month to HSBC, American banks, and overseas Chinese banks at 5.53125 yuan and 5.5625 yuan. By the afternoon close, the trend had turned stable. The spot price for British and American currencies for this month was 3 pence and 5.5625 shillings, and for the next month, it was 3 pence and 5.546875 shillings. Both spot and futures for the US dollar were at 5.53125 yuan. Compared to the closing price from the previous day, the British and American currencies were unchanged. The market was closed on Saturday afternoon.

Hong Kong US Dollar Plunges

The spot and futures prices for the British pound and the spot price for the Japanese yen remained unchanged. The spot price for the US dollar plunged by 0.375, to 23.125 yuan. The spot price for the Shanghai currency rose by 1 yuan, to 420 yuan. At 9:35 AM, the US dollar continued to tighten, with the spot price softening again by 0.0625, to 23.0625 yuan.

Tianjin British and American Currencies Recover Slightly

Tianjin, 5th (Saturday) dispatch: The currency market opened calmly this morning. The spot prices for the British and American currencies each recovered slightly by 0.03125. The British pound was at 3 pence and 4.0625 shillings, and the US dollar was at 5.3125 yuan. The Shanghai currency remained unchanged, opening at 104.77 yuan. The unofficial market price for "Joint Notes" rose sharply by 0.4 yuan, to 83 yuan.

### Gold Market Unpredictable

Yesterday's spot gold price in the unofficial market started well but briefly broke below 5,800 yuan mid-day. Market sentiment was lukewarm because the exchange rate fluctuated only slightly and there were negative rumors. This made it difficult to raise interest in gold. The subsequent rebound in prices was due to short covering at low prices. The closing price was 5,830 yuan, a slight increase of 12 yuan compared to the previous day. The trend was similar to the previous day. The market was closed on Saturday afternoon. The external market was firm initially, then stable. Trading volume was relatively strong for half a day, estimated at around 2,500 taels. Silver jewelry remained unchanged. Customs gold and other items were stable.

Spot Gold Rises by 12 Yuan

In the early morning, the exchange rate was stable, and operators still had demand. Gold firms took in 20 taels from securities firms at the opening price of 5,865 yuan. Shortly after, gold and silver firms were eager to buy, raising the price by more than 10 yuan. Gold firms paid money exchange companies 30 taels at 5,875 yuan. Subsequently, gold firms sold 10 taels to silver firms at 5,865 yuan. At that time, retail investors suddenly became interested in buying, pushing the price to the edge of the 900 yuan level. Silver firms traded 10 taels at 5,885 yuan. However, securities firms and short sellers sold aggressively, causing the price to fall. Securities firms sold 20 taels to gold firms at 5,840 yuan. Gold firms then bought 20 taels from silver firms, raising the price back to 5,855 yuan. Finally, money exchange companies, securities firms, gold firms, and others jointly sold, causing the price to drop below the 800 yuan level. Money exchange companies sold 20 taels to gold firms at the low price of 5,790 yuan. Later, due to short covering, gold firms recovered, raising the price again. Silver firms took in 10 taels from securities firms at the afternoon closing price of 5,830 yuan. The market was closed on Saturday afternoon. In the external market, the price was initially 5,850 yuan, and there was some trading. The last price heard was around 5,830 yuan, a decrease of 12 yuan from the previous day. The selling price of spot gold from gold firms was more than 10 yuan higher than spot gold, and the buying price was 30 yuan lower. The current benchmark gold price was 50 yuan lower than the listed price, and there was little trading.

Jewelry Gold Still Listed at 600 Yuan

The selling price of jewelry gold per tael in silver jewelry stores remained unchanged. Dah Tong Hang listed at 600 yuan, and the prices at Xin Tong Hang were similar to the previous price. The buying price was about 30 yuan lower.

Japanese and Korean Banknotes Continue to Decline

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw spot gold fluctuate, so the rise of the British pound was like a fleeting flower. It eventually fell slightly by 0.5 yuan. The supply and demand for British gold banknotes were balanced, and the market price remained stable. The evening market remained at the original price of 58 yuan. The US dollar banknote fluctuated, but eventually stabilized. The supply and demand for Hong Kong banknotes were equal, and the market price remained stable. There were many sellers of Japanese and Korean banknotes, and the market price continued to decline. The former fell to 1.44 yuan, and the latter fell to 1.14 yuan.

### Financial Commentary by Sheng Kaiqiong

October 5th, A Word to the Financial Industry

Since the Zhejiang Industrial Bank first announced a reduction in interest rates on current deposits, followed by the Shanghai Bank, and then the China & South Sea Bank, Kincheng Banking Corporation, the Yieh Chih Commercial Bank, the Continental Bank, and their joint savings association, it can be said that Shanghai's major commercial savings banks have all implemented lower interest rates on current deposits. Other commercial savings banks are either observing, discussing, or planning, and implementation is not a question. If it is profitable to use funds for speculation, it may be delayed. If it is not profitable, then interest rates can be reduced, since there is an example to follow and it is not too late.

The reasons for these bank's interest rate reductions are: (1) High prices and huge bank expenses make it difficult to profit from the difference between deposit and loan interest rates and handling fees. (2) Bank loans are difficult to use because there are no safe and reliable borrowers. It is also dangerous to engage in foreign exchange speculation. Therefore, receiving deposits is simply incurring interest expenses. (3) Since the implementation of the stable financial measures, the limitation on Shanghai withdrawals and deposits by the Malu Electric Light Company, depositors only seek convenience and do not care about the amount of interest. They are transferring deposits to current accounts or even to foreign banks without interest. In fact, depositors no longer care about the presence or absence of interest, let alone the amount of interest.

Regarding this issue, I once wrote about "Interest Rate Reductions and the Inward Transfer of Funds" in the previous financial commentary to Shanghai's banking industry. Now that several banks have begun to implement it, I feel that the meaning is not exhausted. I am not afraid to speak frankly and will make another statement to Shanghai's financial industry.

Assuming that my analysis of the reasons for interest rate reductions is accurate, and the financial industry believes that these three reasons are 100% correct, then I do not want to say more about the first and third points. However, I have some comments on the second point. Although it is a fact that bank deposits have increased and loans are difficult to make, we should recognize that the increase in deposits did not begin in 1929, and the difficulty in making loans did not begin in 1929 either. Let us examine the balance sheets of the major commercial savings banks that have reduced interest rates. Since 1926, except for 1926 when deposits decreased due to the war, they have increased significantly since 1927, far exceeding the record of 1925. Although the trend of increasing current and fixed deposits has differed, with fixed deposits being slower and current deposits being faster, banks certainly did not realize this only this year. They should have felt it as early as 1927. Why did the banks not reduce interest rates in 1927, 1928, or even the beginning of 1929, but only in the second half of 1929? As for the difficulty in making loans and the difficulty in using funds, the business records show that mortgage loans have neither increased nor decreased, investments in securities have not increased, and interbank deposits have greatly increased. The investment return on government securities is more than 1%, so why not invest in public bonds if mortgage loans have no outlet, but instead accumulate funds in interbank loans? In fact, some banks have purchased large amounts of foreign exchange since the outbreak of the war, and some banks have deposits of more than 10 million in the British HSBC Bank. Who would believe that Shanghai's banking industry is not speculating in the foreign exchange market! In the past, although banks felt that deposits were increasing and loans were difficult to make, foreign exchange speculation could yield multiple times the profits, so deposits increased, but interest rates were not reduced in 1927, 1928, or the beginning of 1929, but only in October in the second half of 1929.

There are also objective reasons why banks have recently started to reduce interest rates. Since the sudden contraction of the foreign exchange market on May 2, speculators believed that the value of the legal currency would continue to fall. Unexpectedly, after May 10, the European war expanded, the British and French military were at a disadvantage, and the German army invaded Holland and Belgium. A run on deposits occurred in Shanghai's foreign banks. In order to cope with this, a large amount of foreign exchange was sold off, and a very large selling trend occurred in the foreign exchange market. The exchange rate gradually became looser, with the British pound rising from 3 pence and a half to outside 4 pence, and the US dollar rising from 4.71875 yuan to above 5.5 yuan. The US dollar even rose above 6 yuan at the end of June. Although speculators took advantage of the revision of commercial exchange rates and the tension in Vietnam in August and September to engage in buying, the power of their influence on the market had become exhausted. Although the exchange rate was slightly tighter, the tightness was very slow. Furthermore, the difference between the current and near-term prices was not much, so there was no profit to be made from speculative arbitrage. This is one reason. At present, the world is changing rapidly, and both Eastern and Western powers cannot stay out of it. Therefore, the currency value of any country has the risk of falling. Therefore, the foundation of the legal currency is definitely not as strong as the currency foundation of any country. Except for the possibility of a short-term commercial imbalance in supply and demand or the speculative use of the situation to tighten or loosen the currency, the legal currency itself has no possibility of falling. This is the second reason. Then, instead of turning deposits into foreign exchange there, or depositing large amounts of money in foreign banks at no profit, and suffering interest losses (this is the real waste of interest), it is better to find another way out. However, the mentality of bankers is different from that of the public. It is said that a certain bank's funds in HSBC Bank have not been touched, and after the interest rate reduction, it only saves 200,000 yuan in interest expenses per year. However, a certain bank is unwilling to transfer 10 million yuan to the national bank to earn 2% interest of 200,000 yuan. It is still looking forward to the speculative profits of foreign exchange and would rather suffer interest losses and transfer this loss to depositors. On the surface, it says that bank expenses are huge and that interest rates must be reduced to prepare for its own expenses! From this one line, from this one thing, the rest can be inferred.

I am not deliberately saying that the banking industry's interest rate reduction is inappropriate at this time and place. I hope that Shanghai's financial industry can think carefully about how much contribution it has made to the war of resistance and national construction in this great era of resistance against Japan, whether it is more beneficial to the country or more harmful to the country, and not to focus on the calculation of profit and loss, but to actively do what I said in "Interest Rate Reduction and the Inward Transfer of Funds"! (To be continued)

### Securities: Domestic Debt Rises Slightly, Still Dependent on Changes in the Situation

The unofficial market for securities rose slightly yesterday, as I unfortunately predicted. Those who have been in this business for a long time can tell that this trend is a necessary path for a large rise and a small retracement, but it will definitely not cause a decline. Therefore, the price quickly rebounded after the fall. With the continuous and widespread absorption by the silver and money industries, many selling orders emerged, but they were still bought up by buyers. Therefore, the prospect is for continued upward movement. A grade securities at 60 yuan is just around the corner. Since the situation in Myanmar has changed, the Yunnan-Burma Road has hope of opening as scheduled. Therefore, the United States and the United Kingdom have shown blatant support, indicating that China is gradually in a favorable position. However, on the other hand, the actual situation in Shanghai cannot be ignored. If they reach the end of their rope, they may resort to reactionary measures. Like dawn breaking, with the sky hazy, some shocks are unavoidable. Therefore, the future changes in the debt market still depend on the situation. However, in the end, there will definitely be good luck. Yesterday morning, Xinfu and Hongda, the large buyers, sold off nearly one million securities in large quantities. Xinchang, Lianhe, and others also sold very actively. Most of them were bought by the silver and money industries. The market price only fell by a small amount of 0.5 to 0.6 yuan. In the afternoon, the buying sentiment suddenly became strong. Hongda bought back significant quantities from Yiji, Lianyi, Lemao, and Defu. The market situation recovered from low to high. Xinfu had stopped selling. Hengfu, Xinchang, Lianhe, Shuntai, and others sold off slightly. However, large short positions have not yet been covered. Yesterday's results, except for grade D securities, which were up 0.05 yuan, the rest recovered by a small amount of 0.15 to 0.55 yuan. The transaction volume was 2 million yuan. A simplified table is listed below:

Stock Trading: 500 shares of Chinese-owned electric company stock were traded at 6.5 yuan per share, up another 0.05 yuan. London market prices were unchanged.

### Textiles: New Speculators Active, Cotton Cloth Prices Rise Sharply

Domestic Cloth: Yesterday's rise intensified. Because actual sales were not strong and sellers took the opportunity to sell off, the rise lagged far behind. This attracted the buying interest of new speculators, and the volume of transactions gradually expanded. However, the price differences for various cloths were huge, ranging from 0.1 to 1 yuan or more. Fine cloth, fine twill, serge, direct tribute cloth, and others rose by about 1 yuan. Coarse cloth, coarse twill, and others rose by 0.25 to 0.5 yuan. About 2,600 pieces were traded in the market. Demand from merchants was weak. Jardine Matheson opened 2,000 pieces of coarse cloth for October and November.

Eastern Cloth: The rise continued to intensify. Fine cloth and fine twill rose another 0.7 to 0.8 yuan per piece. Serge rose by 0.04 yuan per yard. Because the price of raw yarn was rising at the opening, the cloth market was very chaotic. The highest price for fine cloth once reached 37.55 yuan. Mid-day, those who profited sold off, bringing the price back down to 36.85 yuan. Because there were not many spot lots available, speculators gathered, and the market rise started again in the afternoon, reaching a high price of 37.45 yuan. At the close, some short-term speculators sold off, pushing the price down to 37.2 yuan, but the market sentiment remained very strong. Four Gentlemen serge closed at 1.115 yuan per yard.

Exports: Three pieces of textiles were shipped to Hong Kong today, and 175 pieces were shipped to Siam.

Yarn and Cotton: Asking Prices Too High, Cotton Market Deadlocked, Prices Up 20-30 Yuan in Recent Days

Spot cotton transactions have become less active, and the transaction volume is much lower than the previous day. This is because the yarn market has risen again and again, and the rise in the cotton market, which has been depressed for a long time, is far out of proportion to the yarn market. Therefore, sellers are not satisfied. However, because asking prices are too high, factories are still unwilling to stock up, resulting in a deadlock. Fine cotton, 30.00 guarantee of abundance, 96 pieces taken in by Jinfeng

The above is the factory price: Rangoon 181.00, 400 pieces taken in by Shenghe, another 185.00, another 400 pieces.

Pula 209.00, 200 pieces taken in by Jifeng. Fine cotton, 30.00, 31 pieces taken in by Chengde

Also, a report on the foreign cotton market price: New York cotton market, the market situation is firm, and then it rose due to the short covering of some short positions. As a result, the closing price was up 2-3 points for the near term and 8-10 points for the long term compared to the previous day. India, including forecasts, rose by half a rupee.

The foreign cotton transaction in Shanghai has been very active in recent days. All parties believe that the inventory in Shanghai is decreasing day by day, that the transportation of foreign cotton to Shanghai is difficult, and that the selling price in Shanghai is actually lower than overseas. Therefore, factories and fellow merchants are competing to buy, and prices have risen sharply. In recent days, the price has risen by a huge amount of 20-30 yuan. According to this trend, there is a risk of cotton shortage in the future.

### Large Speculators Sell Off, Cotton Yarn Prices Rise and Fall Wildly

The recent yarn market has been going up and down, but the trend is very strong. This is because there is still continued demand for 10-count coarse yarn from Hong Kong. At the same time, speculators are spreading rumors that raw cotton is being blocked and that the source is difficult to obtain, and they are uniformly bullish on cotton yarn. Therefore, they are fueling the flames, and people's hearts are like hair. However, looking back at the panic on June 28, the market plummeted to 800 yuan, and no one dared to accept it. It is now at 1,200 yuan. However, the inventory of yarn is still above 300,000 bales. Once the excitement is over, there is a danger of repeating the previous mistakes. Today, 70 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong and 355 pieces were shipped to Siam.

The opening price of 20-count Double Horse yarn this morning was extremely enthusiastic, at 1,187 yuan, up 20 yuan from the previous day's closing price. However, the buying trend was like a tide, and the price rose to 1,218 yuan in an instant. Some people said it reached 1,220 yuan. At this time, those who were buying on the market were as hot as fire, and many said that a certain yarn had reached the limit. Unexpectedly, large speculators took advantage of the chaos and suddenly sold off, falling to below 1,180 yuan in a moment. Finally, because buyers were still firm, it rose again to above 1,200 yuan. After the close, it fell slightly by 10 yuan to 1,190 yuan. According to the statistics of transactions in half a day, 5,955 bales were traded. The price of 20-count yarn rose by 18 yuan. The amount bought by each company is listed on the left.

Oil Market: Manipulating Crude Oil Without End, Selling Price Soars by 5-6 Yuan

The edible oil market situation is driven by two factors: first, sales channels have not been cut off in various markets; and second, the environment is conducive. The upward potential should not be underestimated. The market has changed from a gentle increase of 1-2 yuan to an uncontrolled surge. Speculators were all delighted. Yesterday, soybean oil only rose by 2 yuan because trading between the two parties was limited and could not be expanded. However, the quantity of peanut oil available at the docks was sufficient for manipulation, so speculators were unscrupulous, and the "rubber ball" trading was wanton. The market price rose linearly. As a result, both spot and futures oil soared by 5-6 yuan. 400 pieces of Jiaozhou crude oil were traded at 80 yuan to 82.25 yuan. 100 pieces for October delivery were traded at 80.075 yuan to 82.25 yuan. 2,500-2,600 pieces for late October delivery were traded at 80.075 yuan to 84 yuan. 80 barrels of Qingdao crude oil were traded at 110 yuan. 50 barrels for October delivery were traded at 109.5 yuan. 600 barrels for late October delivery were traded at 110 yuan to 112.5 yuan. 300 tins of Yantai refined oil were traded at 105 yuan. 200 pieces of Jiaozhou road soybean oil were traded at 84 yuan. More than 500 dan of Dayaoyu factory soybean oil were traded at 94.5 yuan to 95 yuan. The price of old warehouse orders was 92.5 yuan to 93 yuan.

### Sugar Market: Japanese Merchants Buy Coarse White Sugar

Yesterday's sugar market trend remained soft, with a slight continued decline. The association's listed price for spot 24 coarse white sugar was 78.5 yuan at the local warehouse, and 77.5 yuan at the foreign warehouse for July arrivals. Japanese merchants bought 500 bags, and the transshipment price remained unchanged at 61.5 yuan. Dutch cotton white BA grade also showed a loosening trend, with an asking price of 74.5 yuan, but no transactions. Dutch red remained at 59.6 yuan. Taikoo brand B grade sugar was 75.5 yuan, and DY grade sugar was 73.3 yuan, both down a slight amount. HX grade sugar was 73 yuan, down a slight amount. HHM grade sugar was 67 yuan. Yesterday, 11,700 bags of sugar arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong.

### Metals, Lead and Iron Transactions Continue

The lead and iron market has been quiet for a long time. However, since yesterday and today, the thermos bottle factories in this city have been purchasing en masse for raw materials because they see that the season is approaching. In addition, can factories and others also occasionally purchase, so the market appears to be bustling, and the asking price is rising step by step. Yesterday, 200-pound Association cargo was sold for 135 yuan per box, and double-linked plates of 20 inches and 28 inches with patterns were sold for 145 yuan per box. It is estimated that about 100 to 200 boxes were traded yesterday. Besides the two groups mentioned above, foreign merchants such as the Yantai group also loaded goods to other places.

North-South Goods, Qingdao Raw Peanuts, New Products Seen in Production Area

Qingdao News: 5,000 bags of existing stock of old raw peanuts were recently traded at 24 yuan, and later rose to 28 yuan to 29 yuan, with 500 bags traded. New products have also been launched, with only 20 bags arriving, purchased by the Shanghai gang, with a price of 38 yuan, exceeding the old goods by 10 yuan.

### Rice Industry Received Telegraph Yesterday: Hong Kong Permits Export of Rice, Ban on Transshipment Lifted Yesterday, Market Sentiment Relaxes, Rice Prices Fall

The Hong Kong authorities, in order to prepare for emergencies, had previously issued an order to store large quantities of rice for emergency use, and at the same time prohibited the transshipment of all stored rice to other ports. After this news spread to the Shanghai market, market sentiment immediately turned upward, and rice prices rose frequently. A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency learned from the rice industry yesterday that rice firms in this city received a telegraph from Hong Kong yesterday, stating that the Hong Kong government had lifted the ban on rice exports the day before yesterday, and that all stored rice could be transshipped to other ports. After the news spread to the market yesterday morning, market conditions became more relaxed, and market prices continued to fall by about three to four yuan.

Increase Inventory

The soaring rice prices in Shanghai were indeed caused by speculative rice merchants hoarding and manipulating the market. However, on the other hand, the source was often hindered by rumors of transportation restrictions, and people were inevitably panicked, making it difficult for market prices to fall. Therefore, smoothing the source and increasing rice reserves cannot be delayed. Moreover, during this extraordinary period, when the National Government's reach is limited, some speculative rice pests regard the law as a mere formality and engage in private transactions as a regular occurrence. Although the National Government and the authorities of the two concessions in this city have repeatedly ordered that the manipulation of large quantities of rice and the banning of illegal transactions be prohibited, the results have been limited due to the special environment. Large merchants rely on their power to control the market, and the relevant rice industry groups also use "insufficient strength" and "inability to cope" as excuses to ignore the situation, leading the entire rice market to its current state.

Ensure Public Security

Since the prices of domestic and foreign rice have risen frequently, the livelihoods of ordinary people have become precarious. If this continues, the entire public security of society will be greatly affected. Although the authorities of the two concessions are mindful of this and have repeatedly planned to take effective steps to implement them, while consulting back and forth on concrete measures to stabilize the rice market and repeatedly resolving to arrest illegal rice pests and punish them according to law, due to the special environment, it is difficult to eliminate illegal transactions in the market in one fell swoop, and rice prices continue to rise sharply. Ordinary people, unable to make a living, are driven to desperate measures. In the recent case of rice robbery near the intersection of Xinjibang Road East and Bili Road in Hongkou, it was found that a certain rice shop was transporting three bags of white rice worth about 230 yuan by truck from the warehouse of Chen Shaoqing. Just as the truck was loaded and moved out not far from the shop, it was surrounded and seized by several ordinary people, who then fled in different directions. As a result, one person, named Fang Asan, was arrested and sent to court for trial.

Group Purchase of Rice

The Shanghai People's Food Adjustment Association has repeatedly resolved to act as an agent for the collective purchase of a considerable amount of foreign rice. Now, the association has decided to take advantage of this decline to purchase in large quantities as a group. According to a member of the association yesterday, it is hoped that various factories, businesses, and organizations in this city will understand the livelihoods of their employees, advance large sums of money, and actively participate in the group purchase of foreign rice. If they continue to wait and see, and the employees still have to rely on purchasing rice from various rice shops in this city every day, then the burden on the livelihoods of the people in this city will increase sharply. The member continued, "Our association's handling of various procedures is honest and reliable, and is purely voluntary." Therefore, it is hoped that major factories will go through the rice purchase procedures as soon as possible, so that they can start purchasing in large quantities and allocate it regularly in Shanghai.

Refuse to Accept Collateral

It is rumored that the rice giants in this city have recently contacted the money industry, requesting that the various banks and shops restore rice collateral loans. It was found that this matter had been proposed and implemented before, but it was shelved because it was extremely difficult to prevent the use of collateral loans to hoard and manipulate rice. Now that rice prices are high, the old matter is being brought up again. It is not difficult to discern the intention. It is heard that the money industry has decided to comply with the instructions of the National Government and the two financial departments, and refuse the strict order to accept collateral loans for rice and daily necessities. The request from the rice industry will not be considered, in order to prevent fueling speculation.

### Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Encounters Landmine, Train Service Interrupted Yesterday, Japanese Military Vehicle Destroyed on Xicheng Highway

On the evening of the 3rd, a train on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway derailed near Danyang after being struck by a landmine planted by the Chinese army. This was confirmed by a spokesman for the Japanese army at a press conference the afternoon before yesterday. According to reporters, the accident occurred at Qili Bridge, between Danyang and Lingkou. Two zhang of track were destroyed, and one locomotive and one car were destroyed. The driver and many passengers were killed, and traffic on the Nanjing-Shanghai line was cut off. After the Japanese side sent track workers to repair it, it was reported that at about 7 a.m. yesterday morning, a freight train from Shanghai derailed and exploded after touching a landmine planted by the Chinese army near the Kuatang station west of Zhengyi. Many cars overturned, and many people were killed or injured, causing traffic on the Nanjing-Shanghai line to be cut off again. As of 5 p.m., there was no news of repairs. Northbound trains only went as far as Kunshan. It was also reported that recently, guerrilla warfare by the Chinese side has been extremely active in the Xicheng area. The Japanese army stationed in Xicheng is cowering in the city, fearful. At about 4 p.m. on the 29th of last month, two Japanese military vehicles on the Xicheng Highway were also struck by landmines planted by the Chinese army and were destroyed. More than 40 Japanese soldiers were killed or injured. At the same time, Bridge No. 2 on the highway was also destroyed. Currently, the Shanghai-Nanjing Highway bus service only goes to Zhitang as the final destination.

### Shanghai Substitute Prosecutors, Superior Promotion, Higher Court Review and Reporting, Tao Dejun and Others All Substantively Appointed

Tao Dejun and 19 other substitute prosecutors in the courts of the two concessions in this city are proficient in law and loyal in their work, and have served in the courts for a long time. According to a reporter from the Pingming News Agency who inquired with the courts yesterday, the Ministry of Judicial Administration is very concerned about the courts in Shanghai, and has ordered the higher courts of the two concessions to review and report on their attendance, performance, and merits. After successively complying with the order to report, it is heard that the Ministry of Judicial Administration has decided to distribute the substitute prosecutors, and will uniformly change Tao Dejun and the other 19 people to permanent vacancies, in order to comply with the law and encourage them to work hard.

### American Troops Taking Over Central District Urgently Awaits Early Decision, America Will Not Concede Due to Huge Assets, Chinese and Foreign Residents Eagerly Await the Takeover

After the British garrison in Shanghai withdrew from Shanghai, the British military defense of the central district of the Public Concession that they left behind should be taken over by the American military, according to the decision of the garrison conference on August 25. However, due to strong opposition from the Japanese side, the Shanghai Municipal Council Volunteers temporarily took over the defense. Chinese and foreign residents within the concession all hope that this matter will be resolved as soon as possible, in order to stabilize the status of the Public Concession. A reporter from the Pingming News Agency inquired about this issue from various parties concerned. It is now learned that negotiations between the US and Japan on the issue of the US taking over the defense of the central district have not yet yielded a concrete solution. However, it is known that the US authorities will definitely adhere to their original intention and will not concede, because they actually own huge properties and rights and interests in the central district.

Close Contact with Washington

Since Herrick and seven others arrived in Shanghai on the 25th of last month, they have repeatedly held consultations with the US Minister to China in Shanghai on the issue of the Far East at the US consulate and on the flagship USS Augusta. According to knowledgeable foreigners, Herrick's consultations with the US military commander in Shanghai are often held at the US consulate on Jiangxi Road, but now they have been changed to the USS Augusta, and they are in close contact with the Washington authorities at any time.

US Warship Leaves Shanghai, Departure Was Scheduled

In addition, five destroyers belonging to the US Asiatic Fleet, No. 218, No. 219, No. 222, No. 224, and No. 230, which came to Shanghai with Herrick from North China on the 25th of last month, suddenly set sail from Shanghai one after another on the morning of the day before yesterday and sailed to the Philippines for the winter. The departure of the five US warships has aroused social speculation. However, according to a reporter from the Pingming News Agency who inquired with the parties concerned yesterday, the departure of these five destroyers from Shanghai to the Philippines was a pre-arranged plan and should not be surprised at.

### Lord Mayor of London Thanks British Overseas for Sending Two Relief Donations, £4065 Received

The British community in this city specially raised donations to help the civilians in London who were killed and injured in the air raids. They sent two batches of remittances to the Lord Mayor of London on the 11th of last month and the 1st of this month, totaling British gold £4065. Yesterday, a telegraph from the Lord Mayor of London was received thanking them, saying that the donations for the relief of the air raid victims had been received and were deeply appreciated.

### President Cleveland to Arrive Tomorrow, Russian Empress Arrives Today

The Russian Empress postal ship of Changxing Company came to Shanghai to go to Little Luzon in the middle of last month. Now it is returning from Little Luzon, scheduled to arrive at 6 pm today, berthing at the Gonghexiang wharf in Hongkou. Passengers should take a small boat to the New Customs wharf at 6:30 pm to disembark. The Russian Empress is scheduled to depart at 4 am tomorrow morning to Japan and return to Vancouver. The last shuttle boat to pick up passengers is scheduled to depart from the New Customs wharf at 11 pm tonight. American President Lines

Cleveland

Returning from Little Luzon, via Hong Kong to Shanghai to return to the United States, according to the itinerary, it should arrive today, but due to the hurricane on the sea a few days ago, it must be delayed by one day. It is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow (7th). The arrival time is 9:30 am tomorrow morning, berthing at buoys 12 and 13. Passengers should take a small boat to the

New Customs Wharf

To disembark at 10:45 am. The postal ship is scheduled to depart for Japan and return to the United States at 4 am on the 8th. The last shuttle boat to pick up passengers will depart from the New Customs wharf at 1 am tomorrow night (i.e., the morning of the 8th). The last departure is because it is already during the city's curfew, so there is still a 9 pm shift tomorrow night. The Zibade ship of the Chazha Company has been changed to Wednesday to arrive in Shanghai.

### Stopping Black Market Speculation: Suspension of Forward Exchange Sales; Exchange Stabilization Fund to Stabilize the Exchange Market; Authorization for Foreign Banks to Handle Matters

Since the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee used its full power to stabilize the legal exchange rate and maintain the Shanghai black market exchange rate, the exchange rate has remained consistently stable. After the establishment of the Sino-US $25 million loan, the foreign exchange fund has become increasingly substantial. The Shanghai black market exchange rate has been extended, and the value of legal tender has been invisibly increased. Now, in view of the increasingly tense and unpredictable international situation, British and American banks have decided to reject forward exchange transactions and foreign exchange swaps in order to prevent and eliminate speculation. After implementation, speculators will be unable to use their tricks, and the black market exchange rate will be able to maintain long-term stability, without affecting legitimate industrial and commercial sectors. - New Sound Society

Speculation Runs Rampant, Causing Profound Harm

A reporter learned from banks dealing in foreign exchange that forward exchange bills are one of the businesses of Shanghai exchange banks. For example, current forward exchange bills have terms of November and December, which means payment is due in November and December. It has been found that the exchange bills purchased by banks include those for non-export trade, such as demand drafts issued based on travel letters of credit, and non-trade reverse drafts, as well as those for export trade, such as documentary bills for collection and letters of credit. These exchange bills are mostly forward. Therefore, each exchange bank has its own forward exchange bill market. The Shanghai foreign exchange black market is beyond the reach of the Chinese government's authority, leading to rampant speculation and causing damage to legitimate merchants. Methods should be devised to strictly suppress it.

Forward and Swap Transactions are Suspended

The foreign exchange black market is rampant due to speculators, and unfounded rumors continue unabated. These speculators lack strength and mostly buy and sell forward exchange bills. After maturity, they often roll them over. This rollover is a swap. Such speculation is sufficient to affect exchange rates and the legitimate trade of a country. The harm it causes is not merely a matter of individual ethics for speculators. Therefore, all countries try to prevent foreign exchange speculation. However, under this special environment, the Shanghai foreign exchange black market has created unprecedented rampant speculation. The Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee's painstaking efforts to maintain the black market have won the admiration of friendly nations. Now, HSBC, Mercantile Bank, Citibank, Chase Bank, and other British and American banks have agreed to suspend forward exchange bill transactions.

Stabilization Committee Authorized to Handle Matters

Regarding British and American banks working together with the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee to stabilize the Shanghai black market exchange rate, they will do their utmost to maintain it. If the market's foreign exchange shrinks sharply, the Foreign Exchange Committee will supply as much as possible. When the foreign exchange extends, the Foreign Exchange Committee will buy in. This exchange buying and selling policy strongly resists the attacks of speculators. Later, various foreign banks stopped foreign exchange swaps, aiming to reduce foreign exchange speculation. After all, under today's circumstances, the complete elimination of foreign exchange speculation is indeed difficult to achieve in reality. This rejection of forward exchange transactions is truly the only good way to eliminate speculation and stabilize the exchange market. It seems to be the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee that has authorized British and American banks to handle the matter.

Refusal to Sell Foreign Exchange Not the Case

The Datong News Agency says, quoting a report from the Japanese Domei News Agency, that American banks in this port will refuse to sell at the counter in order to secretly resist Japanese merchants, etc. According to an interpretation by a foreign economic authority in this port, foreign banks have recently restricted futures transactions, but all types of merchants are treated equally, with absolutely no discrimination against the Japanese. As for the Japanese rumors, there may be other intentions. However, the exchange market in this port has not been affected by these rumors, and the exchange rate has not shown a tendency to ease. There are many who are inclined to believe it.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Explains the Reasons for Water Accumulation in Shanghai; Illegal Construction Outside the Shanghai International Settlement Destroys Drainage Equipment; But the Whangpoo Conservancy Bureau Believes it is Related to the Neglect of the Whangpoo River

According to the explanation of the Public Works Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council regarding the reasons for water accumulation, in recent years, Shanghai has often suffered from water accumulation. The main reason is that there are many illegal buildings in the area of roads outside the Shanghai International Settlement (up to the railway), which has led to the destruction of most of the drainage equipment in that area. The ditch water overflows onto the road surface, up to the western end of the drainage equipment of the Shanghai International Settlement. The area of ​​this district is equal to the area south of the Suzhou Creek in the Shanghai International Settlement, so the wide range of overflow can be imagined. Since the beginning of last year, the Public Works Department has begun to set up machinery to clear ditches,

### Goods Stranded in Vietnam: Efforts to Transport Them Back to Shanghai; Chinese Business Groups Send Personnel to Handle the Matter; It is Reported that Shipping Between Hong Kong and Haiphong will Resume in the Coming Days

Yesterday afternoon, Chinese business groups in this port held a meeting. Afterwards, it was announced that the goods stranded in Vietnam due to the blockade of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway are worth tens of millions of dollars. They will try to transport them back to Shanghai. At that time, it was decided that each merchant firm will send representatives to Haiphong and Saigon to request assistance from the Chinese consulates to find ways to transport the goods originally intended for transportation to the Chinese mainland back to Shanghai. According to what was known yesterday, shipping between Hong Kong and Haiphong will return to normal on the 8th of this month.

Clearing Ditches

By the end of last year, the main drainage hub had been cleared and has remained clean ever since. In North China, it is not uncommon to see hurricanes bringing heavy rain. In Shanghai, however, hurricanes often come without much rain. However, this time the situation was special. The arrival of the hurricane coincided with the high tide season. At that time, the wind and rain were mixed and came fiercely, lasting for 24 hours. At the same time, it stirred up the river tide, resulting in this major flood, which was only seen since 1865 (the depth of the water accumulation was 10% lower than that of 1865). Since Monday of this week, the tide has risen above some roads twice a day. Until today (Saturday), there is hope that the river tide will subside. Under this high tide situation, it is not only difficult to expect the road water to drain away, but also

Ditch Water Backflow

The only comprehensive solution is to block the outlet of the ditch on one side and pump out the accumulated water on the other. This method was designed by the chief engineer of the French Municipal Council many years ago. If it is only applied to the two Shanghai International Settlement areas south of the Suzhou Creek, it will cost about 100 million yuan and take ten years to complete. However, according to the Water Conservancy Section of the Whangpoo Conservancy Bureau, the accumulation of water on the roads this time is related to the tide, but not entirely due to the high tide. It has been found that the highest record of the Whangpoo River's high tide over the years is

Fourteen Feet

And more. The floods at that time were not as serious as they are now, and they did not last as long. The annual neglect of dredging of the Whangpoo River is an undeniable fact. Before the war, the dredging of the Whangpoo River over the years had improved the riverbed and water flow significantly. The neglect of dredging in the past three years has affected the rise and fall of the tide, and the high tide level has not risen much in recent days. Although the hurricane has stirred up the water level and made it higher, its impact is only a temporary overflow of the ditch, and it cannot subside all day long.

### Spokesman of the Japanese Embassy is About to Leave for Shanghai; Transferred to Consul in Singapore

According to a report in the Continental News, Tsurumi Ken, spokesman of the Japanese Embassy, ​​stated at a regular meeting with foreign reporters the night before that he had been officially ordered to be transferred to the Japanese Consul in Singapore and was scheduled to leave Shanghai for his post in the near future. It is reported that Mr. Tsurumi has only been working at the embassy for more than a year. According to him, he had two missions in Shanghai: one was to convey news as quickly as possible, and the other was to improve the relations between Japan and third countries, or at least not to allow them to deteriorate. However, he believes that the regret is that he was unable to complete the latter mission due to his own lack of ability. Mr. Tsurumi had frequent contact with the foreign press in Shanghai. This transfer and departure from Shanghai is not without a sense of regret.

### The Tripartite Pact of Germany, Italy and Japan is Not Valued by Speculators; They Know that Germany and Italy Cannot Assist Japan; Disputes in the Far East Still Need to be Borne Independently

The English-language Financial and Commercial News states that since the establishment of the Tripartite Pact of Germany, Italy and Japan, the exchange market in this port has not been shaken in the slightest, which is quite intriguing. Speculators in this port have always created something out of nothing and taken advantage of the situation. This time, however, they have failed to act. It is well known that Germany and Italy cannot provide military assistance to Japan. Some have said that the Tripartite Pact can allow Japan to act freely in East Asia without any worries. This is truly ignorant. Japan must bear the disputes in the Far East independently. For the past three years, if Japan had considered it to be in its own interests, it could have completely occupied Shanghai. The establishment of the Tripartite Pact has not changed this or other issues. Therefore, the victory that the signatory countries should convey is actually meaningless. Speculators in this port do not attach importance to this agreement, which is probably due to this.

### Negotiations on the Labor Dispute of a French Company Enter a Stagnant State Again; Labor and Management Did Not Meet Yesterday; The Issue of Workers' Reinstatement is Deadlocked

The labor dispute of the French Water and Electricity Company, after mediation by the Political Department of the French Police, labor and management once negotiated on the 2nd, but no satisfactory result was obtained. Labor and management originally scheduled to continue negotiations yesterday morning, but the meeting could not be held due to the absence of the management representative, causing the labor dispute that gradually showed signs of resolution to fall into a stalemate again. According to the reporter's investigation, the Political Department of the French Police is very concerned about this labor dispute. At 4 p.m. yesterday, it summoned the labor representatives to the Political Department again to inquire about everything in order to find the most appropriate steps for resolution. It is heard that the labor's attitude, in addition to requesting the Political Department of the French Police to uphold justice and appealing to all sectors for sympathy and assistance, also requested the Chinese directors of the Public Works Department of the Shanghai International Settlement, Yu Zhiqing, Yuan Lvdeng, and Wei Tingrong, to consider the current plight of the workers' lives and the importance of social security, and urge the management to reopen negotiations as soon as possible in order to resolve the labor dispute as soon as possible and avoid the expansion of the situation.

Deadlock Between the Two Sides: The Key Issue

The labor dispute of the French Tram Company has been going on for ten days since it occurred, and there is still no hope of a complete resolution. According to the investigation of the Shewen News Agency reporter, the key issue is that among the various conditions put forward by the labor, there is one regarding the more than 40 workers dismissed by the company, who must be reinstated. However, the company authorities believe that the dismissal of more than 40 workers occurred some time before the strike and should not be included as a condition, causing dissatisfaction among the labor. The resolution of the labor dispute has fallen into a stalemate again. Therefore, the settlement of the French Tram Company's labor dispute must wait for the resolution of the dismissal of these workers.

Management Indicates Resolution Next Week

According to the English-language American Evening Post, the strike of the French Concession tram and bus has lasted for ten days and is still difficult to resolve. According to Favreau, the manager of the French Tram Company, yesterday, the resolution of the labor dispute may not be possible this week and will have to wait until next week to see progress. In addition, it has not yet been determined whether the company authorities and the striking workers will negotiate again. At the same time, three more employees of the French Tram Company were kidnapped last night, bringing the total to five. Two of them were ticket inspectors, and the other was a driver. Each kidnapping case was carried out by five people holding pistols. It is also said that the French Police denied this morning that a tram was bombed yesterday. According to the

After Chen arrived in Shanghai, he was instigated by his lover, Lu Zhenquan, and his cousin, Gao Yuhong, to embezzle the entire amount and hide it in the Zhaoshang Hostel at No. 13, Lane 566, Zhejiang Road. Then Chen bought a pair of sunglasses and pasted two plasters on the lenses. He then rushed to the Longchang Bank and falsely reported to his owner, Yu Zhongheng, that the money had been robbed at the Laobazi Road intersection. Jin believed it to be true and led Chen to report the case to the Huishi Police Station. After questioning Chen, Chinese Detective Shang Wu found Chen's statements evasive. After repeated questioning, Chen could not tell the truth. Detective Shang then ordered his staff to bring in the two suspects, Lu and Gao, and the stolen money.

Unexpectedly, one of the kidnapped people had a good relationship with the Japanese, so the Japanese authorities learned the whereabouts of these people, and together with the police, arrested them. Among them were also many thugs who threw bombs at various newspapers, and their main culprit, Wu, was also escorted to Jiangning for investigation.

### Charity Table Tennis Women's Mixed Doubles Lineup Determined

Peicheng Held Final Practice Yesterday. The Peicheng Girls' Middle School table tennis team, with team members Feng Mingyin, Guo Huichao, Zhang Lizhi, and Gui Rongzheng, has been selected as the mixed doubles representatives to participate in the charity table tennis competition against the Women's Youth Team. In order to fully prepare, Zhu Zhiying, the school's physical education director, held a final practice in the school's auditorium at 4:00 PM yesterday. Chen Linsheng, the first mountain instructor, described various important techniques for communication and hitting in doubles matches. It was decided to start practicing immediately. Guo Huichao was temporarily absent due to illness, and Zhang Xia was selected to pair with Feng Mingyin, and formed a practice match with the Zhang Gui team. Zhang is a basketball and volleyball athlete in the school, and she is very flexible. Although she was making her debut, she cooperated well with Feng, and as a result of the three rounds, the Zhang Feng team actually defeated the Zhang Lizhi Gui Rongzheng team by a score of two to one. Finally, the opponents were rotated and exchanged, and the hits were very outstanding. Therefore, the school decided to abandon Guo Huichao, and combined Zhang Xia's draw with Zhang Lizhi's block, and paired the all-around Feng Mingyin with the defensive Gui Rongzheng. Therefore, the lineup of the mixed team is even more complete, and it will definitely pose a serious threat to the Women's Youth Team. The mixed team's doubles roster is listed below:

Lin Jinlan Cai Xiuyu (First Doubles)

Feng Mingyin Gui Rongzheng (Second Doubles)

Zhang Lizhi Zhang Xia (Third Doubles)

Gan Lanjun Tao Lanying (Reserve Team)

### Three Musketeers of Shanghai Football Join Hong Kong Eastern Club

Cao Qiuting, Xu Wenkui, Yan Shixin (Hong Kong Correspondence) The Eastern Football Club, in view of the approaching start of the football league, is engaged in sharpening its weapons and reorganizing its lineup. As for the position of goalkeeper, Liu Xianhan has joined Guanghua, but it is not difficult for him to return to his mother's house. And the three musketeers Cao Qiuting, Xu Wenkui, and Yan Shixin, famous players from Lido in Shanghai, have safely arrived in Xiangdao and decided to serve Eastern. Together with the original team members Hou Chengtou, Zhang Jinhai, Xu Jingcheng, Liu Shizan, etc., their strength is exceptionally strong. Their ideal lineup is as follows:

Liu Xianhan

Yan Shixin Jiang Shanjing

Luo Weiquan Xu Jingcheng Liu Shidu

Hou Chengtou Cao Qiuting Xu Wenkui Zhang Jinhai Zhong Yongshen

The above lineup has abundant strength in the front and rear, and is suitable for both offense and defense, and can compete with the Sing Tao team. However, according to another source, Nan Hua has been dragged away by Sing Tao to a large number of fierce generals, and has the intention of attracting Hou Chengtou, Zhang Jinhai, and Zhong Yongshen. The truth remains to be verified. Also, the Eastern Association recently crossed the river to fight against the police team on Boundary Street. The lineup was relatively weak. The three musketeers from Shanghai had not arrived, Jiang Shanjing stayed in Macau and had not returned, and Luo Weiquan was absent due to an incident. New recruits Fu Zhibin and Chen Runfa had to fight on the front line. Fortunately, the police were disorganized, and Eastern narrowly won by a score of three to two. After the start of the game, the two sides held on for ten minutes. Zhang Jinhai of Eastern broke through the barrier and went straight in, and got a wonderful pass from Hou Chengtou. With a little skill, the ball flew into the net, opening the record. The police launched a major counterattack, and in the 28th minute, they did manage to pull back one goal. However, Zhang Jinhai of Eastern scored a goal in the chaos before the end of the first half, so the result of the first half was that Eastern took the lead by two to one. After changing sides, Feng Kunsheng of Eastern scored with a header, making it three to one. Half a minute before the end, the police struggled to win another city, summarizing the score as three to two, and Eastern won by a narrow margin. The lineup of Eastern's appearance on that day is as follows:

Huang Xiang

Xu Buyun Chen Runfa

Yu Qiaqing Xu Jingcheng Liu Shizan

Hou Chengtou Feng Kunsheng Zhang Jinhai Fu Zhibin Zhong Sen

Donghua, the only Chinese team in Group A this year, held a full practice last week and will have a friendly test match with the Lux team this afternoon at the association's stadium at the intersection of Lafayette Road and Bihu Road. There will be matches in both Group A and Group B, starting at 2:30 PM, first for Group A, followed by the reserve group match. Both sides will determine the official lineup after this battle. According to this year's West Union Football Tournament, since Lido announced its withdrawal, the British and Scottish armies have also been transferred and left Shanghai, and the strength of the teams has gradually reached the same level. Donghua's lineup this year is extremely complete. Dai Linjing is back in uniform, Li Ning is making a comeback, and Huang Kehou, formerly of Lido, has returned. The morale of the army is greatly boosted. According to Dong Xiaopei, a former Donghua athlete, Donghua's entire team members are on the field to practice every Monday, Wednesday, Friday afternoon, and Sunday morning, and they are working hard. They have great ambitions for the major championships this year, intending to restore Donghua's former glory. The lineups of the two teams today are as follows:

### Introducing an American School

The scorching heat has just passed, and the golden wind is refreshing. 14 million students in the United States are about to return to school again. 127 miles northwest of Boston, there is a Groton School, which only accepts 285 students. It seems to be a small scope, but it is actually very famous. The solemn and dignified academic style is very similar to several famous public schools in England, such as Eton and Harrow. England has public schools with a long history, but only Eton is the most outstanding. The United States has 15,000 private schools, and Groton School is the best among them. The founder of Groton School was Dr. E. Peabody. The school was established 11 years later with the help of celebrities. At that time, there were only 17 students. For half a century, although the school has not had many students, its reputation has risen and it has become a famous school. Dr. Peabody is 83 years old this year and retired last month to spend his leisure life in a village house near the school. The succeeding principal is Kruger, who is only 41 years old. He graduated from his alma mater and studied at Harvard and Cambridge.

The admission age for Groton is 11 to 13 years old. It does not accept students who are older because the school authorities know that to cultivate an outstanding student, it must take five or six years of cultivation. If the student is too old, there is nothing they can do. The freshman's degree is the same as the first grade of elementary school. Students must pass character and academic tests when they enroll. The annual tuition fee is 1,400 US dollars.

When new students enroll, they are only allowed to bring pocket money and no other money is allowed to be brought into the school. Because students have an allowance of 25 cents a week while studying at the school, allowing them to stroll around the village on Wednesday and Saturday afternoons. Once they enter the school, they cannot go out until mid-June. In addition, there are 19 days of vacation for Christmas and 17 days for Easter. Students are not allowed to leave the school at the end of the week.

The entire school building consists of three brick houses, a stone chapel, a gym, a baseball field, a ball field, and 90 acres of grassland. The student dormitory is very simple. A 60-square-foot room has a bed, a wardrobe, a chair, and six coat hooks. In the washroom, a long stone sink has a space reserved for each person to put a tin washbasin and three coat hooks. Each person has a desk in the classroom, and only fourth-year students have a self-study room. During the break after the morning class, eat some milk or soda crackers, but you cannot have both. If a freshman wants to sit in an armchair, it depends on his performance in the past year. Otherwise, he can only find it in the library.

Students have to wear long pants all year round at school. Students who have worn long pants for a year are qualified to be freshman instructors and tell the new students about their experiences in the past year. Tell them what things cannot be done and what events violate school rules. However, these old students have no special rights other than fulfilling their guidance duties, and they cannot bully new students.

US President Roosevelt, Secretary of State Wells, Ambassador to Japan Grew, Bishop Maffett, former President Ziwadu. Roosevelt, and the sons and grandsons of the wealthy Morgan, all graduated from Groton School and were personally instructed by the old principal Dr. Peabody.

There are a total of 30 teachers in the school, and there is almost one tutor for every six students. Their powers are quite large. If a student has a minor fault, he must be punished as much as possible. Last spring, a student criticized the food at dinner. He was punished to eat the same dish at every dinner, and then he had to stand up and leave the table, walk to the principal and say a few words of apology: "I have eaten enough and I am very happy. Now I am very sorry that I have to leave my seat. I cannot disturb the delicious dessert."

Teachers who eat with the students, if they see that the students at their table have bad "eating manners," they will ask him to stand up until everyone has finished eating. Those who make trouble for no reason are punished with "silence." Before the lips are unbanned, the punished student cannot say a word. Those who commit more serious offenses are punished with labor. Students who commit this kind of offense are often punished to clean the teaching room, mow the grass, sweep the leaves, or wash cars and bathe dogs and cats for the teachers. One teacher has an old British wool dog, which is specially used to provide punishment for students.

Groton Principal Peabody

The most serious offense is punishable by confinement, locking the offending student in a small room on the top floor of the dormitory, and giving him only water, bread, and a Bible as company every day. The duration of the punishment is two days, but this kind of punishment has only been used twice since the school was founded.

In addition to the "Spartan" strict education, Groton students also lead a "monastery-style" boring life. In ordinary American schools, you can always see female students, but in this school, except for the principal's family or the teachers' wives, women cannot be found. The nearest women are at Kang High School, 15 miles away. There is only one dance party held during the weekend before Washington's birthday in the year. Only the top two grades of students can participate. Beforehand, one representative from each of the two grades will go to the station with the teacher to welcome the girls. The girls will arrive at the school on Friday afternoon and stay in the teachers' wives' residences. There will be a performance in the school on Friday night, and a dance party will be held on Saturday night. It will stop at 11:45. The time for boys and girls to talk is only during breakfast on Sunday morning and between attending church.

Groton pays great attention to religious cultivation. No sports meetings can be held on Sundays. In addition to doing two services on Sundays, there are ten minutes of service before class on weekdays. Collective prayer is also required in the evening. Although Groton does not prohibit students of other religions from enrolling, religious cultivation is a compulsory course.

All day long, the bells in Groton School are clanging and endless. From getting up at 6:50 in the morning, the bells are continuously ringing every few moments until the senior students go to bed at 10:00 at night. Before attending church on Sundays, eight students go to the bell tower of the church and pull the ropes to ring eight different bells for a quarter of an hour.

Dr. Peabody himself teaches the "Bible" class, and this class is not a joke. After this class is over, the school atmosphere becomes slightly relaxed and lively. There are also a lot of exchanges between teachers and students, which can increase the feelings of both parties and achieve twice the result with half the effort in teaching. Therefore, a relaxed atmosphere is often maintained between the two. Groton students' weekly allowance

is 25 cents, as mentioned earlier. This makes all students equal. There are 30 scholarships in the school, and the children of ordinary people and the sons of millionaires are treated equally. The two grandsons of the wealthy Morgan also entered the school this year. They also eat their own food and try to earn some pocket money on their own. One started a shoe-shining business and could earn more than one yuan a week. One scraped the old paint on the boats by the river. This also took a lot of time. A teacher asked him kindly if he felt too tired. Morgan replied: "It is, but old paint is worth 50 cents a gallon."

Although Groton vigorously implements this spirit of grassroots economic construction, it is, after all, a school with aristocratic colors. Almost all graduates enter the officialdom or become nobles. As far as presidents are concerned, in addition to Roosevelt, there is also Coolidge. And there are still many special colors; like students have to wear hard collars when eating dinner. Black patent leather shoes must be worn for evening self-study.

Groton maintains a good academic style, which is simple, pure, and impeccable. Once, the authorities of another school wrote to Groton and asked why there were no students smoking or drinking in your school. The reply was "We don't have this problem here at all." Someone also asked what would happen if two students talked loudly in the lecture hall. The answer was: "They won't do that."

Former US Ambassador to France Bullitt said when he was young: "I don't know any Groton students who don't have a snobbish attitude of a gentleman." This is an exaggeration, but in terms of their appearance, it is inevitable to be criticized as such. However, in terms of its content, in Groton School, graduates, teachers, and students are a trinity, like a big family. This spirit is long-lasting and strong, which can be described as "accumulating thick and flowing light."

### The Situation in Dakar

The U.S. State Department last month inquired about establishing a new consulate in Dakar, French Africa, in order to constantly monitor whether Germany would use French West Africa as a starting point for coveting South America and British African colonies.

Dakar Port is Germany's best strategic location to extend its influence southward and westward from Africa. It is also an important base for the French fleet in West Africa. French ships sailing from South America and South Africa replenish fuel in this port. The port's naval facilities are also complete, with strong fortresses, anti-aircraft gun positions, and a large arsenal. The port can repair destroyers and submarines and store a large amount of coal and oil. There is also a large airfield with hangars and repair shops. The South American air route operated by the French Aviation Company starts here. German planes can now take off from Germany, pass through the Netherlands and Spanish territory, and arrive in Dakar, carrying small teams of German troops. From Dakar, it is only 1,600 miles across the South Atlantic to Brazil.

Dakar Port is not only strategically important and well-equipped, but also can serve as a submarine base to attack key British shipping lanes. Ships sailing from South America or the West African coast and those rounding the Cape of Good Hope all stop at the free town of Freetown in British Sierra Leone in West Africa (located 550 miles south of Dakar), and then are escorted by British warships along the route near Dakar to Britain. If Germany were to seize Dakar by force and use it as a base for submarines and light surface raiders, Britain would have to send more warships for escort, and ships could suffer significant losses. Dakar's air base is also an excellent starting point for attacking British colonies in the south.

Britain has never trained indigenous troops in its African colonies, which is its weakness. France, however, has trained a large number of indigenous troops in its African territories, which, if used by Germany, would cause great trouble in the future.

### The Opium Poppies of North China

The opium poppies are in full bloom again on the North China Plain. The area covered is much larger than last year. Taking a train from Beiping (Beijing), one can see white poppies everywhere, growing luxuriantly. The opium poppies planted this year are at least four times more than last year, and some say they have increased tenfold.

The area between Beiping and the Great Wall, the eastern part of Shandong Province, and the plains of central Shanxi Province are now covered with opium poppies. According to reliable investigations, one or two tenths of the arable land in the Shanxi plains is planted with opium poppies, and each acre can yield 180 taels of opium paste, the harm of which can be imagined. All areas in North China where opium poppies are planted are within Japanese-controlled areas. The opposite is true in guerrilla-controlled areas. Guerrillas in Shanxi Province have ordered the people to eradicate the planted opium poppies, with severe penalties for violators. A very large amount of opium paste is produced annually in Inner Mongolia. Farmers have recently been alarmed and are destroying opium poppies. The organizations under Japanese protection, however, fine villagers 50 yuan per acre if they eradicate opium poppies.

The land tax per acre for planting opium is 10 yuan in Inner Mongolia, 12 yuan in Hebei Province, and 15 yuan in Shanxi Province. The land tax is low, and the purpose is to encourage the planting of opium poppies. (Translated from a Christian Science Monitor dispatch from Beiping)

### Several Famous Public Schools in England

— L

Eton, Harrow, Winchester, and Rugby are the four most famous schools in England. They are all public schools, different from private schools, but somewhat similar to public schools in America. Among these schools, Eton is the most outstanding. Founded in 1440, it has the longest history and has produced the most famous figures in politics. In general, however, these four schools are all birthplaces for important figures on the British political stage, and they represent many different factions. It is not easy to get into these schools. Parents have to pay 250 pounds in tuition each year. There are so many applicants that they often have to wait a long time for an opportunity. Ancient Latin and Greek are among the required courses.

British public schools retain many special characteristics. Each school has its own representative school emblem, and graduates wear ties of different colors with pride. There are also some peculiar habits: Harrow students always wear hard-brimmed straw hats and vests, and when they salute, they raise their right hand and extend their index finger; Eton students usually wear tall hats and tailcoats, showing a noble and dignified attitude. They also play a game called "wall game," and in the past 100 years, only three goals have been scored! They wear black clothes to mourn George III, the patron of the school (who died in 1820). On June 4th, his birthday, all the students wear a bright flower on their lapels to commemorate him. Eton even has its own language, which outsiders often do not understand.

Eton admits 1,100 students each year, Harrow 650. Since 1850, Eton has produced a total of ten British Prime Ministers. Harrow has produced four fewer, a total of six. Every Harrow graduate carves his name on the wooden boards of the school building. When Eton students score 50 runs in cricket matches, they plant a tree on campus. The Duke of Wellington, who defeated Napoleon at Waterloo, was an Eton alumnus. He planted a tree on campus, and many people say that Wellington's victory at Waterloo was due to his training on the Eton playing fields.

In addition to the ten Prime Ministers, current political figures who attended Eton include Eden and Lord Halifax. It is estimated that one-sixth of the 615 members of the British House of Commons attended Eton. King Leopold III of Belgium also studied at this school.

Harrow was founded in 1571. Notable students include modern politicians such as Prime Minister Churchill, Lord Gort, Director of Military Education, and Sir Hoare, Ambassador to Spain. Famous literary figures who attended the school include the great poet Byron and the novelist Galsworthy. Rugby was founded four years earlier than Harrow, in 1567. Former Prime Minister Chamberlain was a graduate of this school. When he formed his cabinet, seven of the eight cabinet members were graduates of this school. The famous educational novel and film "Goodbye, Mr. Chips" is based on this.

Eton students wear dark green ties with light lake-colored stripes, while Harrow's ties are black with double thin stripes; Rugby's ties are dark green with wide black and thin white stripes, which are darker than Eton and Harrow. Winchester's ties are vermilion, crimson, and dark blue, which are very eye-catching. This school is the oldest of the British public schools, founded in 1394. It now has seventy students, who live in 17th-century school buildings and study in Victorian classrooms, truly ancient.

Other well-known British public schools include Charterhouse, founded in 1611. Sir Baden-Powell, the founder of the Boy Scouts, was a graduate of this school. Westminster School was founded in 1561 by Queen Elizabeth, and the great literary figure Johnson was a top student at this school. Uppingham School, founded in 1584, is a birthplace for famous bishops and skilled cricket players. Radley College was founded in 1557 and was originally just a grammar school. It now has 380 students. The famous educational film "Goodbye, Mr. Chips" was filmed here.

Weekly Supplement

### We Should Look Up to God

In our current life, everything we hear and see is unsatisfactory, eight or nine times out of ten. One family does not know another's affairs. There are great difficulties for some, and small difficulties for others. No one is without difficulties. Many people shed tears in secret, thinking that God does not care for us. They are depressed all day long. This pessimistic mood really should be remedied. What method can be used to remedy it? There is no other way except to raise our heads, look upwards, and look up to God in heaven. If we do not look upwards to God, then whether we look outwards or inwards, we cannot invigorate our spirits. Because when we look outwards, we see bankrupt farmers and depressed businesses. It can be said that no one is not suffering, and there is no hope. If we look inwards, we only see ourselves with scars and many defects. We cannot lift our spirits either. Therefore, to invigorate our spirits, we must look upwards to our God. If we do not look up to God, then the result will be like what we are experiencing now. Nothing can please us. Everything that God makes us encounter has good intentions. If we do not look up to God, then there will only be discouragement and only disappointment.

God is the one who gives people strength. If we look up to God, we will surely receive strength from God to cope with all difficulties and hardships. The world is full of changes. Those who own millions of assets and live in luxury may soon be landless. Sometimes they are guests of honor, sometimes they are prisoners. Wealth and honor are like passing clouds, changing constantly. We rely on human power and human strength, hoping to have a support, but human power is sometimes as unreliable as an iceberg, and human strength sometimes comes to an end. What can we do? The poet of the Jewish nation said: "I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my help. My help cometh from the LORD, which made heaven and earth. He will not suffer thy foot to be moved: he that keepeth thee will not slumber… The LORD shall preserve thee from all evil… from this time forth, and even for evermore." (Psalm 121) We should also have the same faith as this poet, and look up to our God. (Reprinted from the 10th)

### Please Benefit Children Again

— Xinfang

After reading Wang Cangping's article, "Please Benefit Children," in addition to sharing Wang Cangping's hope that Shanghai's enthusiastic people can rise up to advocate various children's welfare undertakings, I have one more supplement: the issue of extracurricular reading for children. Before the August 13th Incident, we could say that this type of reading material was still abundant. The Commercial Press published "Children's World," "Children's Pictorial," etc., and the China Publishing Company published "Little Friends," "Youth Weekly," etc. Other enlightened publishers had "New Youth," but after the war broke out, these publications were suspended one after another. Until the war shifted westward, they flourished again for a period of time. At that time, the publications were probably founded by several elementary school teachers, such as "Shanghai Children," "New Children," "Good Friends," etc. Major newspapers such as Shen Bao, Sino-American Daily, Da Wan Bao, Xinwen Bao, and Wenhui Bao also published children's supplements every week. At present, there is an unprecedented silence. The supplements in the newspapers have been suspended due to soaring paper prices, and some have reduced their space. As for the periodical publications, there is not even one. Not long ago, we also saw a "Children's Monthly" edited by Wang Renlu, but it was discontinued after two issues. The consequences of this phenomenon are very regrettable. Some children do not know how to use their spare time, and the street stalls in the isolated island are full of children reading absurd and useless little books, which is due to the lack of proper extracurricular reading materials for children!

From this, the importance of children's reading materials is self-evident. Therefore, I hope that the writers, cultural circles, and publishing circles who are still in Shanghai can use part of your energy to benefit our children in this area. The sales of children's reading materials may not be comparable to other books, but for the sake of the country's future, this does not need to be considered again. Finally, let me propose four principles that must be based on when editing children's reading materials, for everyone's reference: instill knowledge of children's era, cultivate children's lively emotions, cultivate children's good virtues, and increase children's knowledge of life.

### Autumn Diseases

— Su Ming

The weather has changed from hot to cool, which is undoubtedly a sign of the arrival of autumn. When autumn comes, diseases are most likely to occur. Look, the newspaper reported that more than 1,000 people died in the two concessions last week, and most of them were Chinese. This news will certainly not escape the eyes of an average child. That's right, autumn is indeed the season when diseases are most rampant. "So why is it easiest to get sick in autumn?" "How do you get sick?" These two questions are reacting in the child's mind. In the eyes of ordinary children, the child is like an idiot, and can ask such naive questions. However, children, if you are asked, can you answer it? I think, although the question is very ordinary, its answer is not ordinary. So it is not easy for a child to think of meaningful questions, and your brothers and teachers are very happy to answer you. Therefore, when the child asked his brother these two questions, his brother was very willing to tell him:

How do diseases happen? This question is not easy to answer, because the word disease covers a very wide range. What kind of disease is it? What cold, cholera, malaria, dysentery... There are thousands of kinds, so the characteristics of various diseases are of course different, and the occurrence of various diseases is of course different. But in short, no matter what disease occurs, there must be a kind of disease bacteria that is making trouble in the patient's body. To know that people get sick, it is not a matter of one day and one night of not paying attention to their own bodies that will happen, but unknowingly, they send the bacteria into the body continuously. So over time, the bacteria will slowly attack. Even in a healthy human body, there are often bacteria that cause diseases. However, at that time, our body's resistance is strong, so that these bacteria are suppressed silently. Once the body's resistance is weakened, the bacteria will run rampant in the body, and the resistance cannot beat them, so the person gets sick. Then where do the bacteria enter the body from? In any part of the body, the bacteria have the opportunity to invade, and the most common is through the nose and mouth into the body. That is, the bacteria are mixed into the air we breathe, or mixed in food, and also invade from skin wounds. Therefore, in our daily life, we must always be careful and guard against the transmission of bacteria into the body, that is, to keep the body clean, wash hands often, choose some clean and cooked food to eat, and there are other various preventive methods. As for why it is easiest to get sick in autumn? Because in summer, there are more sunny days, and the sun is terrible, even those bacteria have fear of the sun, and we are often exposed to the sun, so we disinfect the body, so the chance of bacteria invading the human body is less, and they are mixed into our body from food. At this time, the body's resistance is still strong, so it does not attack in summer. When autumn comes, the autumn wind and autumn rain reduce the power of the sun; the air is also more humid, which is a good opportunity for bacterial activity. If the human body's resistance is weakened, the bacteria inside and outside the body will attack the human body, and the human body will of course feel unsupported and should surrender, so I have to ask the doctors to inject the medicine into the human body, which is also adding a new force to fight the bacteria. But in the current era of soaring prices, I can't even afford to get sick. One

### Song of Tomorrow

— Qiulang

Dear children; your summer vacation is over. Some of you who are eager to learn may have joined this newspaper's summer homework competition, and have done well and submitted your papers for the three items of composition, calligraphy, and painting. What are your results? Wait quietly for the announcement in the future. If you do well, you will of course receive rewards and honors. What an interesting thing! But I am afraid that some lazy children, who do not join the competition, spend all day playing games, and even if their fathers and brothers urge them to review their lessons or practice writing, they often postpone them. They put it off from today to tomorrow, and pass the days in a muddle-headed way. This is really detrimental to your future and wastes your precious time. Isn't it a pity! I happened to recall that the ancients had a "Song of Tomorrow," so I have specially recorded it for lazy children to take as their motto and deeply reflect on themselves! The song goes: Tomorrow and tomorrow, how many tomorrows there are, I wait for tomorrow, everything goes wrong, People are misled by tomorrow! Look at the water flowing east in the morning, and watch the sun set in the west in the evening, how many tomorrows are there in a lifetime? Please take the Song of Tomorrow to heart.

### The Story of the Flyer

— Tang Yaming

In the past, when airplanes had not yet been invented, people imagined that if they had wings, they could fly in the sky. Indeed, the invention of the airplane almost came from this idea.

It is said that in ancient Greece, a man and his son did indeed fly in the sky with wings.

The man's name was Daedalus, and he was skilled in handicrafts. He made many beautiful and practical things, so he became famous far and wide.

Once, he lived on the island of Crete, and at that time, he suffered a great hardship, because he met the enemy of the island's king, so he and his son were imprisoned on a desert island.

Later, Daedalus thought that there was no other way to escape except to make wings out of feathers and attach them to himself and his son. So he attached them to his father and son, and told his son not to fly too close to the sun, so they flew away.

At first, the flight was very smooth, but the child was so happy that he forgot his father's instructions and flew higher and higher. So the wax and feather wings were melted and separated by the heat of the sun, and as a result, the child fell into the sea.

Finally, Daedalus flew to a certain city and was treated kindly by the king of that place. This story may not be true, but it is very interesting.

### Shirley Temple's Autobiography

— Min

Mr. Sheehan immediately wanted us to go to his office to talk, so Mom hurriedly took me there. Mr. Sheehan shook hands with me and sat me down on his desk. He called me Shirley, and he was so affectionate. His hair was already gray, but his cheeks were red and he didn't look old at all. He said to me, "Dear, I think it won't be long before you make millions of people happy—whether they are sick, depressed, or poor—even old people and young people will be happy. In short, no matter who, everyone who sees you will be happy." They will all have to love you, making you the most lovable little girl in the world!"

That night we hired a car to go home, which had never happened before, because the fare was very expensive and we usually couldn't bear to do it. Mom was very happy and said that we hired a car tonight to celebrate. Guess what, I'll tell you something important; I heard Mom and Dad say that we signed a contract later. At that time, because I didn't know how to write my name, I signed an X on the contract. Do you think it's fun? When I first signed the contract, no one thought that I would be so warmly welcomed today.

Not long after the completion of my second film at Fox, one day, a child in the studio came to Mom and said that several letters had just been delivered to the mailroom, which were sent to me. We hurried to the mailroom, and they handed us a small package. Mom and I sat down and opened it together. We didn't know those who wrote the letters, but they had all seen my films. They said many sweet things in their letters, saying how happy they were with me; some even wanted my photo and wanted me to sign it personally.

Mom was happy and very proud to receive these letters, because this was enough to prove that people had begun to pay attention to me. Those famous big stars such as Chaplin, Mary Pickford, and Janet Gaynor can receive hundreds of letters every week, and so does Mickey Mouse. Guess how many letters I receive now? A thousand a day!

At first, there were not many letters. Mom and Dad thought that they would have time to open and answer them after dinner every day; but before long, they couldn't handle it. Now, this matter is handled by my secretary, Miss Delue. Mom and Dad still open many letters when they have nothing to do—especially those from far away places such as China, Japan, and India. Every Christmas, Easter, and my birthday, April 23rd, I receive more letters than usual, and some even come with packages of gifts. I like to open these packages the most, full of surprise and joy. Most of the packages contain all kinds of dolls, or small clothes for dolls. In addition, I also receive many books and books about various games.

Entertainment Circle

### After Entering the Cinema

We watch movies, of course, to seek physical and mental comfort and happiness. Here are a few points for readers to refer to; however, these are completely my own opinions.

(1) If you understand the dialogues (referring to Western films), it is best not to read the instructions, as this will increase your interest.

(2) Be careful not to sit next to people with bad habits! (Such as coughing, spitting, talking loudly, etc.)

(3) Don't sit too straight. Because the light reflected directly from the silver screen can easily hurt your eyes.

(4) If it is crowded, if you go later, don't think that the middle must be full; sometimes it will unexpectedly give you a very good seat.

(5) An old lady sitting with a young man: "Is this a good person or a bad person?" She will always be wary of you and always try to avoid you.

(6) Don't sit next to many people of the opposite sex who are about your age, sometimes it will make you embarrassed!

(7) For horror films and gag films, it is best to sit in the middle; for war films and beast films, it is best to sit a little farther away; for romance films and tragedies, you can sit in the back.

(8) If you have not had a snack or dinner, do not eat cold food in the theater!

(9) When you are excited, don't gesticulate wildly, lest people hate you.

(10) A man's hat must be taken off, otherwise it will obstruct the view of the back seat; it is best not to talk too much with your companions, otherwise you must also speak very quietly.

### Chi Shih-kung's Clear and Melodious Reputation

— New Voice

The performer of old male roles (xusheng) should have a refined appearance, a dignified manner, pure acting style, a clear voice, accurate pronunciation, and an elegant demeanor. The recently debuting young old male role performer, Chi Shih-kung, fulfills all the above conditions.

Shih-kung is a new talent who recently graduated from the Fu Lian Cheng opera school. Even when he was in school, many people said that his style was very proper and that he had great promise. After graduating, his reputation indeed became clear and melodious, astonishing everyone. Last year when I was in Peking, Shih-kung was performing at the Guang De Lou theater alongside Ye Sheng-zhang and others. After hearing him perform in "Catching and Releasing Cao Cao" and "Empty City Stratagem," I was convinced that this performer was the most promising among the rising old male role actors.

Now that Shih-kung has come south with Wu Su-qiu, he is like a newly forged blade, radiating brilliance and being aggressive. Although his voice is not yet fully sonorous, he is very good at using it. In singing, recitation, acting, and martial arts, he can uphold the standards of famous artists in every aspect. He has not been tainted in the slightest by the frivolous styles that are popular nowadays. His appearance is slightly similar to Yang Bao-sen, but much more refined. The intonation of his recitations resembles that of Fu Ying in some places and Shu Yan in others, with Shu Yan's influence being the most prominent. A few days ago, in the "Fa Men Temple" drama, the scattered phrases he sang, "Little Chuan Peng, he is originally a murderous criminal..." and "Scolding Sheng Gongdao is a beast..." were extremely subtle in their rise and fall. We closed our eyes and listened quietly from the audience, and felt that they were truly somewhat like the taste of Yu Da-xian.

### Having Seen "Xiao Xiang Autumn Rain"

— Lan Li

Recently, I saw a performance of "Xiao Xiang Autumn Rain" at the Hu Guang Theater. This film is also adapted from folk tales. The actors and director are very competent. The scenery and costumes are a bit too crude, but generally speaking, it is satisfactory.

The gist of the story is as follows: A wealthy family's daughter falls on hard times and becomes the adopted daughter of a poor fisherman. She marries a scholar. The scholar goes to the capital to take the imperial examination, passes first, and becomes blinded by fame and fortune. He abandons his former wife like dirt and marries the daughter of the examiner, with his father-in-law's help, becoming a county magistrate. The former wife goes to find him (a journey of a thousand miles to find her husband!). Instead, she is falsely accused of theft and exiled to a desolate island. However, heaven has eyes, and she encounters her long-lost father on the way. Moreover, her father has already become a high-ranking official. After executing the punishment first and reporting it later, he naturally takes revenge and snatches her husband back from others. Father and daughter are reunited, and the couple renew their old affection.

Putting aside the happy ending, we see in this film: the tyranny of the wealthy and the corruption of officials. The realism, under the director's skillful touch, reaches our eyes, and we are deeply moved.

As for the several interludes in the film, they are very moving. The one sung by Chen Yun-shang at the gate of Linjiang Post Station is even more full of sorrow, anger, and resentment. Many in the audience were moved to tears because of it! In addition, the one sung by Bai Hong is also a mixture of cold irony and heated scolding, with endless flavor!

### "Destruction" Premieres Today, Starring Shangguan Yunzhu

The long-awaited three-act tragic play "Destruction," a new creation by young writer Hou Yuanqing, will premiere today at 10:00 AM at the Carlton Theater. Famous artists from the film and drama industries will collaborate in the performance, directed by Chuan William and stage managed by Mei Xi, starring Shangguan Yunzhu, Hong Wei, Cheng Ying, and others. All the actors in the play are women, with not a single male role, truly a unique drama.

Hawthorne's Investigation

### The Ballerina's Destination

— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter 8: Two People Arrested

The arrival of these two people was somewhat abrupt, but Hawthorne showed no surprise, and politely invited them to sit down.

Xu said, "Mr. Hawthorne, this guy has been clamoring to see you—for over an hour already. He says he's willing to confess himself, but he wants to talk to you, so he insists on seeing you. Of course, we didn't agree to him. Knowing that Detective Ni returned to the police station, he asked me to accompany him here."

Hawthorne nodded and asked, "How is Zhao Boxiong doing?" The detective shook his head and said, "Not yet. After Detective Ni arrived at the station, he kept the guy in custody. He went home for dinner himself and hasn't questioned him yet."

Hawthorne turned his gaze to Yu Gantang. Although Yu Gantang was sitting, he was actually only perched on the edge of the chair. His upper body was completely straight, and his eyes also revealed a kind of expectation and eagerness.

Hawthorne asked, "Mr. Yu, what do you want to see me about?"

The young man hurriedly replied, "Mr. Hawthorne, you can just call me Gantang, I don't deserve the honor. I—I have something to tell you."

Hawthorne responded with a smile, "Does it concern this murder case? Why didn't you want to say it in the police station?"

Yu Gantang glanced at Xu before saying, "I don't want to tell them. They keep saying that I killed Lilan, it's simply framing me! They are all—are all—"

Hawthorne anticipated that the young man's following words might embarrass the detective next to him, so he hurriedly interjected, "What do you want to tell me? Tell me quickly, don't be roundabout."

Yu Gantang answered directly, "I want to tell you that I am not the murderer, I did not kill Wang Lilan. It was Zhao Boxiong who killed her!" When he said these words, his voice was very firm, and his face also showed a corresponding expression.

Hawthorne had no surprised expression and still said calmly, "What you say must be true, but you have to explain it separately: First, explain why you yourself are not the murderer."
