### British Air Force Retaliates Against Germany: First Attack on the Berlin Area; British Planes Drop Bombs in the Northern Suburbs of Berlin at Night; German Planes Bombard Various Parts of England Again Yesterday

Berlin – This morning, the Royal Air Force carried out a retaliatory attack on Germany, flying in formation to bomb Berlin and other cities. Explosions were heard everywhere in the Berlin area, and anti-aircraft guns in various towns returned fire simultaneously. Some saw two British planes flying from the darkness over government buildings, dropping bombs. At 1:10 AM this morning (8:10 AM Shanghai summer time), the anti-aircraft fire became denser, and explosions sounded on all sides. At the same time, stray bullets from the northwest streaked across the sky, indicating that German fighter planes had taken off to intercept the Royal Air Force. At 1:15 AM, anti-aircraft fire was fired directly from beside the Associated Press building, and then anti-aircraft fire rose from all sides. Interspersed with the sound of anti-aircraft guns were occasional huge explosions, likely from British bombs hitting the ground. When the first air raid alarm was issued at 12:25 AM, all residents of the city rushed to air raid shelters to hide. This was the fifth air raid alarm issued in Berlin, but this air raid was the first attack on Berlin by British planes. At the time this article was being written, the air raid was still continuing. (United Press dispatch, 26th)

Stockholm, Sweden – A Nychter reporter in Berlin reports that ten minutes after the air raid alarm sounded in Berlin last night, a major explosion was heard. Residents took refuge in air raid shelters from midnight until the all-clear signal was given at 1:30 AM, when they came out. The dispatch did not mention any damage or casualties. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)

Berlin – An air raid alarm was issued in Berlin this morning, lasting for three hours. The alarm was issued at 0:20 AM this morning and was lifted at 3:25 AM. At that time, anti-aircraft guns around Berlin fired many rounds. It has now been learned that enemy planes only dropped one incendiary bomb in the Rosenthal area in the northern suburbs of Berlin. One gardener's house was hit and caught fire. Enemy planes also dropped leaflets in northern Berlin. (Haitong dispatch, 26th)

London – This morning, suddenly one enemy plane appeared in the skies over the London area, dropping three bombs, then rising high into the clouds and disappearing to the northeast. All three bombs were designed to make noise, and the sounds varied in intensity. No air raid alarm was issued at the time. It is now believed that the plane was shot down. Two policemen were killed by the bombing, and one bomb landed on the main gas pipeline of a certain street, causing a fire. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)

London – This morning, several large squadrons of German planes again heavily bombed London under cover of darkness. At the same time, long-range artillery of large caliber from the German side also bombarded the Dover area. Although several hundred German planes encountered fierce resistance from British planes and British anti-aircraft batteries, they still managed to break into the skies over London shortly after midnight. The huge British searchlights on the western outskirts of London immediately searched for German planes in the air, and British heavy anti-aircraft batteries also began to roar. Explosions and flashes of fire could be seen in both the western and southern suburbs. The all-clear signal was not given until half an hour later. At the same time, news came from Dover that people had seen searchlights being fired into the sky from the German side across the coast as soon as the German artillery fired, indicating that British planes were also bombing there. The air raids on both sides began after dusk yesterday, so the daytime was relatively quiet. British squadrons encountered suddenly arriving large squadrons of German planes and drove many of them away. (International News Service dispatch, 26th)

London – Last night and this morning, squadrons of German planes again attacked the bomb-scarred London area. This morning's air raid was the fifth time in 48 hours that German planes have attacked this city of eight million residents. At 12:30 AM (8:30 AM Shanghai summer time), they flew over the Dover coast. This air raid lasted for 20 minutes. The strange sounds emitted by the "strange noise bombs" were so loud that they were heard throughout Greater London. During the air raid that began at 10:30 PM last night, bombs fell in several locations in the city. The extent of the damage, the number of deaths and injuries, is difficult to ascertain at this time. Shortly after the air raid siren sounded, passersby heard the rumbling sound of anti-aircraft guns, and searchlights began to flash into the sky. The sound of German planes flying could also be heard. However, the bombs dropped in this air raid all fell on the outskirts of the capital. The all-clear was given at 11:20 PM. (United Press dispatch, 26th)

London – An explosion occurred yesterday in a certain place on the southeastern coast of England, the sound of which was heard for miles. It is said to have been caused by a mine explosion. Lord Knutsford and his sister, Mrs. Williams, were killed in the explosion. Lady Knutsford was also seriously injured. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)

More German Planes Shot Down

London – On Sunday, German planes were less active. It was reported that one person was killed in the Scilly Isles after being bombed in the afternoon. Bombs were also dropped on South Wales, but there was no material damage, and only one person was seriously injured. One enemy bomber in the area was shot down by British fighter planes. Later, enemy planes attempted to cross the Dorset coast but were repelled and did not drop any bombs. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)

London – The authorities issued a communique at 9:30 PM last night (6:30 AM Shanghai time today) stating that German planes were less active over England on Sunday than on Saturday. The British Air Force and anti-aircraft guns shot down a total of 39 enemy planes. At the same time, it was confirmed that another five German planes were destroyed on Saturday, so a total of 50 enemy planes were lost on Saturday. During the air battles yesterday, the British Air Force lost 11 planes, and the pilots of three of them were unharmed. It is now known that 12 crew members were rescued from the 19 British planes lost on Saturday. Last night, London issued its fourth air raid alarm of the day. The buzzing sound of planes could be heard in the suburbs, and searchlights illuminated the sky. People on the roads heard the sound of artillery fire. A terrible air battle occurred over the Dorset coast yesterday afternoon, resulting in 40 German bombers and fighter planes being routed. Three of them crashed on land. Spectators on the coastal cliffs said they witnessed three other German planes crashing into the sea. Four German crew members parachuted to land and were captured. In another air battle off the southwest coast in the afternoon, three German fighter planes were shot down, and several others were believed to have crashed into the sea. Later, another German plane crashed in flames. High in the clouds over a town on the southeast coast, a Spitfire British fighter plane engaged a Messerschmitt German plane. Within minutes, the German plane caught fire and plunged straight down. When it was recovered, the pilot was dead. Moments later, another German plane crashed about 12 miles away. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)

London – It has now been ascertained that 48 enemy planes that attacked England yesterday were shot down by British fighter planes, and six were shot down by anti-aircraft guns, for a total of 54. The British side lost 13 fighter planes. Three pilots parachuted to safety. Last night, enemy planes bombed areas across southern England and the Midlands. Bombs also fell in several places in northeastern England and Scotland. Several fires broke out in a certain town in the Midlands, damaging several factories, several stores, and a theater. Three bombs also fell in a densely populated area in southwestern England, destroying two houses. Several people were trapped in the rubble. Rescue teams and demolition teams cleared the rubble in the darkness for an hour, rescuing two people. The remaining three people were buried in the rubble for three hours. They could still be heard, and rescue efforts were underway when enemy planes returned, but they were chased away by British planes and fled without dropping bombs. A key area in northeastern England was heavily bombed, which only ended this morning. The anti-aircraft fire was also very intense at the time, and many loud explosions were heard, mostly in the suburbs. Bombs fell in several places on the outskirts of a certain town in the London area, causing several small fires and damaging property. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)

British People Have Effective Ways to Prevent Incendiary Bombs

London – During the enemy air raid on a residential area in a certain city in southeastern England last night, one noteworthy feature was that residents were well-versed in how to deal with incendiary bombs. The fires that were started were all extinguished before they became disasters. Even incendiary bombs that landed in open fields were moved to the side of the road by residents with shovels and left to burn themselves out. Air defense personnel were machine-gunned by enemy planes while working, but there were no casualties. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)

Damage from London Air Raid Not Severe

London – Today, there are various signs that the German planes' attack on London on Saturday was a complete failure. Fires broke out in several places in a certain densely populated area, but the residents remained steadfast in the face of the air raid. Their response was one of unanimous hatred for Hitler and no fear. An official from the Department of Internal Security told a Reuters reporter after an inspection that the damage suffered by the London area and the city center was actually very slight and that there was no desolate or chaotic scene after the air raid. Several locations in the city may have traffic cordoned off today because there is broken glass everywhere and the windows and doors of many stores have been shattered, leaving them exposed. The areas of London that were bombed and damaged on Saturday night have been strictly forbidden for residents to pass through. A large square has been cordoned off with ropes, and buses have been rerouted. Even those living in nearby stores and houses must obtain a permit from the police before they can return home to check on their property. When this densely populated area was attacked, only one air raid warden was burned on the arm while helping to put out an incendiary bomb. When Portsmouth was attacked on Saturday, there were very few spectators in a certain movie theater that was hit by a bomb. Only a few people, including two women and one child, were killed by the bomb. When a large squadron of German bombers, escorted by fighter planes, appeared high overhead, the streets of Portsmouth were crowded with pedestrians, mostly residents who had gone to the stores for their weekly shopping. A small number of German planes that broke through the intense anti-aircraft fire split into small groups and indiscriminately dropped bombs, mostly in commercial and residential areas. In addition to the movie theater, a certain sports golf course, a commercial center, and a hotel were also hit. Several rows of coastal farms in Lancing were destroyed, leaving many people homeless, but the number of deaths and injuries was still light. After the German planes bombed a certain gas plant, firefighters were dispatched to put out the fire, but they were also strafed by German planes. A communique stated that regarding the air raid on Saturday night, further news had been received that factories and houses on the northeast coast had suffered slight damage, but there were no further reports of casualties. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)

London – A certain bank on the outskirts of London was partially destroyed during an air raid on Friday. Yesterday, money and valuables were searched for in the rubble, with the Minister of Information, Mr. Greenwood, supervising. Most of the money has been recovered, but the account books are still buried in the rubble. The homes of the bank manager and his family were spared. The bank had a strongly built room, but this room happened to be hit and destroyed. Fortunately, the bank was hit before the alarm was issued, otherwise the manager and others would have taken refuge in this room and perished. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)

London – An air raid alarm was issued in London this afternoon. German bombers, protected by fighter planes, encountered a fierce attack as they flew over the southeast coast. It was previously reported that three German planes were shot down. It is widely believed that two more were also destroyed. British Spitfire fighter planes engaged enemy planes in a fierce battle at an altitude of 30,000 feet. When German dive bombers dropped bombs on a certain city on the southeast coast, they destroyed several houses. Property in a certain area in the southwest suffered slight damage, and there were slight injuries among the residents. According to an announcement by the Ministry of Aviation, of the 55 enemy planes shot down yesterday, 43 were shot down in a battle near Portland. The battle was extremely fierce and unprecedented. Another six were destroyed by anti-aircraft batteries. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)

London – Yesterday, when German planes bombed London, a bomb landed about 300 yards from the villa of the American Ambassador to England, Mr. Kennedy. Mr. Kennedy escaped unharmed. A tree planted by Queen Mary to celebrate the Allied victory in the World War at the American Ambassador's villa was destroyed by the bomb. A hole 30 feet deep and 27 feet wide was blown in the ground there. (United Press dispatch, 26th)

Editorial

### The European War and Vietnam

Yesterday's European dispatches reported that the British Air Force made a long-range raid across the sea on the German capital, Berlin, for its maiden attack; at the same time, 800 German planes suddenly attacked southeastern England. In short, the war between Britain and Germany continues to unfold in tension, without any slackening. However, among these events, there are signs that can be regarded as a pause. The British newspapers unanimously believe that the German offensive against England has now formed a chapter in itself and ended its first phase, and they claim that the British defense has defeated the initial German offensive. The famous Italian journalist, Mr. Gayda, wrote an article warning Britain not to claim victory simply because it has not been destroyed. Therefore, the gains and losses of the battles fought by both sides up to today, although there are different views and perspectives, are undoubtedly, to varying degrees, a section of the war when viewed in the context of British and Italian commentaries. Among these events, there are also signs that can be regarded as an interlude in the play. A dispatch reported that Pope Pius XII met with Mr. Taylor, the special envoy of the American President to the Vatican, on the 20th of this month to discuss the conditions under which Britain could accept peace without damaging its reputation, and to ask Mr. Taylor to seek Mr. Roosevelt's opinion on what role Britain would play in the new European order planned by Germany and Italy. The Pope believes that the opportunity for reconciliation has matured at this stage of the war between Britain and Germany. What we have seen and heard recently only makes us feel that the waves of the European situation are becoming more magnificent and the battle for air supremacy in Europe is becoming more intense. However, although the British and Italian newspapers say that the war will continue to evolve step by step, they both believe that it has come to an end. The Vatican not only sees it as an end but also believes that the opportunity to cease hostilities and seek peace has arrived. This perspective is difficult to imagine and leaves us feeling confused. This is one matter. The issue of French Indochina is closely related to international politics, the division of friends and enemies, the post-war situation, and the flow of resources. Among the countries that have a direct or indirect interest in Vietnam, except for France, if it can strengthen itself, plan its wisdom and courage, recognize that concession is no different from abandonment, recognize that flattery is not enough to achieve complete preservation, and go forward with firmness without avoiding difficulties and dangers, then its temporary encounter may be difficult to describe, but its long-term position may still be maintained. For other countries, the interests are not necessarily consistent, and there are even factors that contain abnormal contradictions with each other. However, in today's drastically changing international situation, all countries hope that France can maintain the status quo in Vietnam, and all countries even hope to be the shield behind France to defend Vietnam. France's situation is indeed extremely difficult, but the environment regarding the issue of Vietnam has eight or nine out of ten favorable conditions. To put it another way, although Germany and Italy have defeated France, they still do not want to regard Vietnam as a forbidden object and seize it for themselves. Although they are confronting Britain, they do not want to regard Vietnam as a base to shake their enemy. China must do everything in its power to resist aggression and prevent Vietnam from falling into the hands of the aggressors. Although Britain has heard of those who covet Vietnam using the excuse of passing through it to invade China, it clearly knows that such an excuse is actually a smokescreen to cover up their important plan to threaten British Burma and Malaya. As for the United States, it is even more terrified that if France cannot maintain Vietnam, then the Philippines will be in a situation where the lips are gone and the teeth are cold. Under such a favorable environment, how should the French authorities deeply understand that the current abandonment will be gone forever, first seek to preserve it during the transitional period of today's drastic international changes, and then seek to survive in the bargaining during the international final settlement in the future? How should they resolutely refuse all threats and demands, regardless of painful coercion, and restore the integrity of sovereignty and administration within Vietnam? Before the war, France had different paths in diplomacy when weighing the pros and cons and comparing priorities. During the war, when there was no time to take care of everything, there were different paths in diplomacy when there was something to avoid. Now that things have come to this point, there are no more different paths! However, news from Vichy is bizarre, absurd, and full of hesitation. Is it said that they are still afraid of the coercion of those who covet it? Is it said that they are still moved by the sweet words of those who covet it? It seems that there are other profound things worth considering. This perspective is difficult to imagine and is also making us feel confused. This is another matter. Perhaps, the accumulated grievances and complicated interests of the international community have been shrouded in heavy clouds for years. Even when the war broke out, there was initially no full confidence or the greatest determination. Therefore, when the two armies face each other, on the one hand, they use artillery fire because they are forced to, and on the other hand, they have other expectations and other brewing plans. Those below are still hoping to take advantage of the situation by following old routines. They are forced to go to war, but they have no certainty of victory, so they are trying to win favorable conditions for the war in many ways. The war between Britain and Germany is indeed magnificent, but each side has its own concerns and avoids using its main force to decide the outcome, and they are temporarily dividing the battle into stages, one and two. The Pope is compassionate and understands the subtleties of people's hearts. Although he knows the difficulty of mediation, he also believes that mediation has never been completely impossible from the beginning, so he wants to make an attempt at mediation at any time. The European situation is like this, which affects French Indochina, so that Germany clearly knows that it has no hope of gaining effective allies in the Far East, but there is a certain limit to its support for the Vichy government for the sake of the Vietnam issue. Even this limit is enough to make those who covet it understand that empty words are useless. Vietnam is still stuck in the midst of problems. Isn't this the reason?

London – A communique from the Department of Internal Security stated that when enemy planes raided a certain city in the Midlands last night, several people were killed and injured, and there was slight damage to municipal, industrial, and residential property. All fires were quickly extinguished thanks to the effective work of air defense and firefighters. Casualties were light in other areas, and damage was also minor. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)

British Planes Heavily Bomb German Oil Factories

London – According to a report from the Ministry of Aviation, the German oil factory in Gelsenkirchen was one of the targets of the British plane raids on Saturday night. British squadrons bombed the factory in a systematic manner for over an hour. When the last plane flew away, the main part of the factory buildings was seen to be on fire and explosions were heard. British bombers also went to Hamburg and Frankfurt to bomb artificial oil factories. Many airfields in France, Belgium, and Holland were also attacked. A fire broke out in the woods near the De Kooy airfield and spread rapidly. The raging flames indicated that the gasoline stored in the woods had been hit. Two British planes also returned safely. Military targets in Milan and Turin, Italy, were also attacked by the British Air Force. All British planes returned safely after completing their missions. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)

Shipyards and storage depots were hit and caught fire. Reconnaissance planes that returned to Germany yesterday morning reported that the port was still in flames. Several airfields in northern Dover were destroyed. The Manston airfield, which had been bombed several times in the past few days, has now been abandoned by the British army. Hangars and nearby houses have been completely destroyed. The airfield in Canterbury has also suffered the same fate. A total of 57 British planes were shot down during the air battles on the 24th, and seven planes were destroyed on the ground. The German side lost 20 planes. On the 25th, the large oil pools in Bristol Harbor and Thameshaven, German factories in Birmingham, and many other locations were bombed. Seven merchant ships in the waters off Wick, escorted by British ships, were bombed and destroyed by German planes on the 24th. The wharves, warehouses, and a ship (2,500 tons) in Yarmouth Port were destroyed. Five merchant ships, each of 7,000 tons, were set on fire. On the 24th, German submarines sank a British destroyer and a merchant ship of 7,000 tons. (Haitong dispatch, 26th)

Berlin – This afternoon, a German military report stated that submarines commanded by Commander Leysingen sank 46,170 tons of enemy cargo. The submarines had traveled far twice and sunk a total of 88,650 tons of enemy cargo. Another submarine sank four merchant ships, totaling 30,000 tons. Yesterday, German planes bombed the Warmwell airfield northwest of Portland and sank a merchant ship with a displacement of 4,000 tons. Last night, German fighter planes bombed aircraft factories and armories in Birmingham, Kings Norton, and Coventry, causing large fires and explosions. Last night, enemy planes flew over Berlin and dropped several incendiary bombs, which landed in the suburbs. This was the first time since the start of the war that enemy planes had attacked Berlin. Enemy planes also dropped bombs elsewhere, but did not hit military targets. German anti-aircraft guns shot down an enemy plane that flew over Berlin. In total, 72 enemy planes were shot down yesterday, of which 51 were shot down in air battles, and 21 were shot down by anti-aircraft guns or destroyed while parked on the ground. Fourteen German planes were missing. Yesterday, the German squadron led by Commander Molders achieved its 150th victory in the air. (Haitong dispatch, 26th)

### China Concentrates All Its Forces to Prepare for the Japanese Offensive; The Large-Scale Japanese Offensive Can Be Roughly Divided into Three Routes; If They Invade Chongqing, They Will Experience Great Difficulties

Chongqing – The Chinese authorities are now concentrating all their efforts to prepare for the Japanese offensive. All political events have obviously been placed in a critical position. Although there is currently no concrete information on the Japanese military plans, people here believe that the Japanese army may launch a large-scale offensive in October, and they believe that the Japanese may make a desperate gamble in this offensive in an attempt to crush Chongqing's resistance. There are three possibilities that are generally expected: (1) The Japanese army may take the south bank of the Yangtze River, pass through Hubei Province and western Hunan, and launch a fierce attack westward on Chongqing. (2) The Japanese army may attempt to cross the Yellow River to invade Shaanxi Province in an attempt to seize Hanzhong, which is generally considered to be the northern gateway to Sichuan Province. (3) The Japanese army may attempt to invade Yunnan Province in an attempt to occupy Kunming, which would automatically close off the routes to Burma and Vietnam. All three offensives will be extremely difficult. The Japanese must send a large army into the mountains of Sichuan Province without any land or water supply to attack Chongqing. Crossing the Yellow River will not be easy, because there are still strong Chinese troops operating in the Japanese rear in Shanxi Province, and the Chinese army is now guarding the opposite bank of the Yellow River. As for the transportation in Yunnan Province, it is extremely difficult. The Chinese authorities there have completed their preparations to deal with the attack. It is widely believed that future military operations, even if not decisive battles, will be extremely noteworthy. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)

### Situation of This Year's Unified Enrollment

Chongqing. In order to inquire about the recent handling of this year's unified enrollment, the reporter recently visited the person in charge of the Ministry of Education. According to reports, as of recently, there are still one or two places that have not been reported to the Ministry. The total number of candidates who have been reported nationwide is 19,014. If the number of people from places that have not been reported is included, it will not exceed 19,500. The actual number of examinees should be reduced according to the practice of the past two years. The total number of applicants is slightly less than last year, because the restrictions on equivalent academic ability this year are stricter. Last year, nearly 5,000 people applied with equivalent academic ability, but this year only more than 900 people did so. Therefore, the number of middle school graduates participating in the unified examination has actually increased by more than 2,000 people compared with last year. Currently, the results from various districts that have been sent are 15 districts, and Luoyang, Taihe, and Shanghai have not yet been sent due to transportation. The districts that have arrived are being reviewed and sorted out. Since more than four-fifths of the results from various districts have been sent, the admission and distribution standards can be determined, and the announcement date is in early September. The reporter asked again how the admission and distribution standards are and whether there will be any changes this year. According to the answer, the admission standards are determined based on the students' scores and the required number of places. In the past two years, the standards have been determined under the principles of not lowering the university level and taking into account national needs. This year's admission standards are also based on these principles and were passed at the second committee meeting yesterday, and the admission work is now being rushed according to these standards. The distribution standards have also been set. The distribution principles have been announced in this year's unified enrollment brochure. The first choice is not restricted by the examination area, and the distribution is based on the order of the students' scores with the same choice. If the first choice is full, the distribution will be based on the second and third choices to the schools and colleges in this examination area or nearby areas, still in the order of scores. If the schools in the area are full or there are no colleges to apply to, the Ministry will refer to the scores, characteristics, examination area, and choice of colleges and assign them to equivalent colleges or other colleges of similar nature. In the past two years, detailed procedures have been established for the distribution, which is absolutely based on scores, and often a difference of one point prevents them from achieving their wishes. For the same total score, the scores of Chinese, English, and mathematics must be used to determine the height. The distribution is arranged in the order of the scores of the candidates with the same choice, and the method is very complete and mechanical, but it is not subject to subjective influence. Even in the case of full assignment schools, the results are the main factor, and those with similar situations are decided by lottery. This assignment work was handled by another committee formed by the Unified Enrollment Committee last year, and this method will also be adopted this year, and seven members have been elected to discuss and decide to ensure that the standards are still followed strictly.

### US Leases British Territories in the Western Hemisphere - Negotiations Have Achieved Concrete Results - Bermuda Islands are Strategically Important and the US Will Establish Defenses - Strategic Position is Equal to Hawaii Island in the Pacific

Hamilton, Bermuda. Retired Governor of Bermuda, Mr. Brat, declared here yesterday that the United States has been allowed to use Bermuda's harbors as naval and air bases. Mr. Brat's statement was made in a message to the Bermuda Legislative Council's emergency meeting. Mr. Brat said, "I have informed the United States that I am very willing for Bermuda to become an important naval and air base for the United States to use to defend the Western Hemisphere." Mr. Brat's declaration is sufficient to show that the negotiations between Britain and the United States regarding the construction of naval and air bases by the United States in British territories in the Western Hemisphere have achieved concrete results. It is expected that other British territories in the Western Hemisphere that the United States wants to use to build naval and air bases will also have the same statement. (Dispatch of the 26th, United Press)

Washington. People here recently believe that Bermuda's approval of the US lease of the land to build naval, land and air bases is only the first step for the US to achieve the construction of naval and air bases in British territories in the Western Hemisphere. People here believe that the Bermuda base is strategically the most important point. Bermuda includes 300 small islands, 580 nautical miles from Halifax. According to naval experts, the islands enable the US naval and air forces to engage in effective Atlantic defense. The Bermuda base can also be quickly connected with other Caribbean bases to form part of President Roosevelt's Western Hemisphere defense plan. The strategic position of Bermuda, it is believed here, is the same as that of the Hawaiian Islands in the Pacific. Officials here also strongly stated that building naval and air bases in Bermuda is extremely important for defending Washington, Philadelphia, New York, and Boston in the event of an enemy attack. Naval experts also said that building a base in Bermuda will enable the US Navy to repair the loopholes in the current defense of the Panama Canal and can bring the US patrols closer to some South American republics and other areas in which the US and Britain are still negotiating to make them bases.

### US Senate to Pass Army Enlistment Bill - Very Self-Defense Program Costs Reach US$2 Billion

Washington. Senate Democratic Leader Barkley predicted here last night that the Senate will pass the Army Enlistment Bill by a majority vote on Wednesday and Thursday. He expects that the amendments proposed by Navarre will be rejected because President Roosevelt has expressed opposition to the proposal. Before the Enlistment Bill is officially implemented, all other proposed amendments will not be adopted. According to the US emergency defense program, the cost will reach 2 billion US dollars. When German troops entered the Low Countries (i.e. the Netherlands) on May 16, President Roosevelt requested a budget of $1,182,000,000. The President's second request was on May 31, but on July 11, the President made a third, larger request to Congress, reaching $1 billion, which was immediately approved by Congress. In addition to this unprecedented amount of money, Congress also passed the "Two Ocean Navy" bill.

Navy Plan

The Navy's current plan is: (1) From 1946 to 1949, the number of ships will increase by 70% compared to the current number, with 35 battleships at that time, compared to only 15 ships. (2) The number of active-duty naval personnel will increase from 146,000 to 400,000 by 1946. (3) By 1944, new naval bases and airfields will be completed in the US mainland and its territories. (4) When the naval expansion is completed, the air force strength will be increased from 2,000 to 7,000 or 8,000 aircraft.

Army Plan

The Army plan is as follows: (1) By September of this year, the active army will be increased to 375,000, preferably by people voluntarily enlisting, and mobilizing 240,000 National Guardsmen. The Army Department proposed that the combined number of regular troops and National Guardsmen be increased to 1 million first, then to 1.2 million, and finally to 2 million. (2) Strengthen the air force strength, increasing it from 3,000 to 26,500 aircraft by May 1942. (3) By 1942, complete the arming of 1.2 million people and the needs for arming 800,000 people. (4) By May 1942, organize and train a new type of mechanized army. Related to this program is the production of military supplies, including increasing the rate of aircraft manufacturing, building new ammunition factories to produce bullets and store large quantities of important military raw materials. (Dispatch of the 26th, United Press)

New Fuel System

Cleveland. After American bombers, reconnaissance aircraft, and destroyers adopted the new fuel system, their speed increased and they were able to quickly fly out of the range of anti-aircraft fire. This new type of aircraft has been unanimously adopted by the US Army and Navy. This type of aircraft equipped with a new fuel device can keep it still at the same altitude. This new fuel system aircraft was built by the Grant Elevator Engineering Plant in Dayton City, Ohio, and the flight test results show that aircraft without a new fuel device vary in altitude at high altitudes, that is, the aircraft is at one altitude today and another altitude tomorrow, but this aircraft with a new fuel system does not have this shortcoming and enables it to fly over 20,000 feet of altitude.

Later, spotting a German submarine, it engaged in a gun battle, but the enemy submarine submerged to escape. HMS Sealion then detected the location of a German convoy and submerged to the middle of the formation, taking a superior position. Just as it was about to fire torpedoes, a German ship suddenly changed course and collided with HMS Sealion. Shortly afterward, the German ship dropped several depth charges, but none hit. HMS Sealion had to lie on the seabed until late at night before surfacing, only to find both periscopes damaged and other parts of the submarine slightly damaged. The crew, braving the dangers and hardships in the raging waves, cleared the damaged parts, but the night was too short to complete the work. HMS Sealion had to submerge again to wait for the next day. The location was not far from the enemy base, and warships were searching for submarines.

### Anniversary of the German-Soviet Pact: Contributes to Peace in Eastern Europe - Soviet Newspaper Publishes Article (Continued to End)

At the time of signing, both sides understood that their friendly relations should not be hindered by differences in ideology and national systems. The signing of the German-Soviet non-aggression pact was on the eve of war, and the goals of British and French imperialism were already very clear. In this regard, we must not ignore this point. Furthermore, there is one more thing we must not forget: in the months before the signing of the German-Soviet pact, Britain and France repeatedly attempted to control the Soviet Union and use it as a tool for their imperialist plans. They also attempted to incite a German-Soviet war. Before the outbreak of this European war, the sole purpose of the war-mongers was to create a situation in which they could "reap the benefits of the fisherman." According to this plan, they re-invented the so-called "non-interference" policy, which gradually changed into a policy of appeasement. Although the style of the authors of this policy changed from time to time, their goals remained unchanged. In short, they incited German-Soviet animosity and planned to use Soviet power to attack a strong Germany. However, the signing of the German-Soviet pact ended this incitement and removed the hostility between the two countries. From this point of view, the German-Soviet pact can be called the most important fact for peace. Two major European powers have abandoned military action to resolve all disputes. This point must awaken the warmongers. But they remained unrepentant, and the European War broke out. Poland, under the machinations of London and Paris, was caught up in the war and, as we expected, was defeated. Thus, the Poland of Versailles was liquidated. On September 28, 1939, when German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop came here, the Soviet Union and Germany further concluded a treaty of friendship and borders, supplementing the deficiencies of the non-aggression pact. This new German-Soviet agreement is consolidating permanent peace in Eastern Europe and could also become the starting point for ending the European war. It is said that Germany proposed ending the war to Britain and France at that time, a proposal supported by the Soviet Union. As for the reaction of Britain and France, everyone knows. Stalin said in his reply to the editor of Pravda, "The ruling classes of Britain and France have resolutely rejected Germany's peace proposals and the Soviet Union's mediation." This proves that the responsibility for the subsequent bloodshed should be borne by London and Paris. It also proves that the new German-Soviet relationship aims not only to build peace between the two countries but also to build peace between all countries. The peaceful and solid nature of German-Soviet friendship can be proven by other facts. Since this is a fundamental change in German-Soviet relations, it should not be limited to political nature. We must solemnly declare that, in addition to political relations, the economic foundation of the two countries has also become more solid. Four days before the signing of the political treaty, the trade and credit agreement was signed in Berlin on August 19, 1939. The cooperation between the Soviet Union and Germany in foreign policy is fully in line with the interests of both sides, and the development of the two countries' economic relations also corresponds to this interest. There is no doubt about this. After the signing of the German-Soviet non-aggression pact, there was an extremely important political document. At the same time, the trade credit agreement signed on August 19, 1939, was further developed. On February 11, 1940, Germany and the Soviet Union concluded an economic agreement. To understand the scope of this economic agreement, we should declare that the development of trade between the two countries in the first year of its implementation was unprecedented since the war. According to this agreement, Germany has obtained a great deal of raw materials throughout the year. These raw materials were greatly needed by Germany due to the British blockade of Germany (this blockade has now extended to all of Europe). On the other hand, Germany supplies the Soviet Union with industrial products (including armaments). This is extremely important in the current tense international situation. The above-mentioned economic agreement has also aroused the anger of war-mongers, although this is their theory. The purpose of these politicians is to involve the majority of countries in the war. They will not hesitate to use force against those who oppose their plans. On the other hand, they will strengthen peaceful relations with other strong countries. The facts of the past year have fully proven the extremely important historical nature of the German-Soviet pact of August 23, 1939. In the current stormy period, the pact has endured all kinds of hardships. Although the enemies of the Soviet Union have spared no effort to create discord between the Soviet Union and Germany, the pact still stands firmly. Regarding this, it further proves the truthfulness of Molotov's report at the Seventh Supreme Soviet Congress. At that time, Molotov said, "The friendly relations between the Soviet Union and Germany are by no means a transitional measure. This relationship is indeed based on the fundamental national interests of both sides." This truth has long been understood by the Soviet Union and Germany, but there is a group of gentlemen who do not and do not want to understand this truth, and they determine various plans based on misunderstood truths. Therefore, the failure of this plan is inevitable. Looking at the facts of the past year, both sides should understand that the treaty signed on August 23, 1939, is indeed in line with the interests of both countries. At the same time, the treaty and the subsequent economic and political agreements have enabled Germany to have no worries about the East, aiming to solve Germany's economic problems. For the Soviet Union, the friendly relations between the Soviet Union and Germany will help the Soviet Union complete its national task on the western border and facilitate the Soviet Union to implement a neutral and peaceful foreign policy. A year ago, the people of the Soviet Union unanimously welcomed the conclusion of the German-Soviet pact. They believed that the pact proved that Germany had indeed recognized the Soviet Union's important role in international affairs. Today, the people of the Soviet Union still unanimously welcome the German-Soviet pact, believing that the pact has made great contributions to maintaining the peace of all of Eastern Europe.

The regiment raided Xitang Town on the night of the 5th of this month with the first battalion, with great success. They killed several Japanese soldiers and obtained three rifles. The second battalion shelled Tongli Town. The Japanese troops stationed in the town retreated to the Wujiang area upon hearing the news. On the 11th of this month, the regiment, led by Commander Chen Yaozong in person with a machine gun company, patrolled the Jiaozhi, Chenmu, and Tongli areas, engaging in a fierce battle with the Japanese troops in the area for four hours. The Japanese troops retreated due to being unable to support themselves, and the Chinese troops obtained five rifles and one machine gun, and sunk two Japanese motorboats. On the 13th of this month, near Luhu and Beiku, they encountered a Japanese motorboat sailing from Lili. Chen led a company of soldiers in a desperate battle with the Japanese troops for an hour and a half. In this battle, seven or eight Japanese troops were killed or wounded, and only two Chinese soldiers were injured. The next day, more than one hundred Japanese troops, traveling on motorboats and small warships, went to Luxu, Xinta, and Jinze areas, intending to retaliate. However, because the Chinese troops were heavily guarded, they were unsuccessful.

### Hurricane Approaches Japan

Apart from the above two hurricanes, no new winds have risen.

### Bank of China Exchanges British Banknotes; All Exchange at Legal Fixed Price for Legal Tender; Exchange Deadline Extended to the 29th

Since the British Embassy in China announced the prohibition of Bank of England banknotes entering the UK, and limited the delivery to a bank in China or mailed from a post office in China before midnight on August 27, in order to be credited when received in the UK, otherwise, they will not be received in the UK. Our Ministry of Finance, in order to take care of the interests of Chinese and foreign people holding these banknotes, has specifically designated branches of the Bank of China as the exchange agencies for British banknotes, in order to collect and transport them to the UK. However, according to a report from the "New Voice News Agency" reporter who inquired with the British Embassy, ​​the above-mentioned deadline has been extended by two days, that is, until midnight on August 29. Therefore, all those who hold Bank of England banknotes must exchange them for legal tender at the Bank of China before the deadline. Also, after the 29th, those traveling to the UK are still allowed to carry ten pounds of Bank of England banknotes.

Bank of China Exchanges at Legal Fixed Price

According to the Bank of China Shanghai Branch, although the branch has not received any notice from the head office regarding the exchange of British banknotes, all Chinese citizens who hold Bank of England banknotes may exchange them for legal tender at the branch. The bank exchanges them at the legal fixed price, that is, one yuan of legal tender is calculated as five pence and twenty-five. Each British banknote is exchanged for 45 yuan, 7 jiao, and 1 fen (national currency). As for the branches of the Bank of China in the interior, they have indeed received notices from the head office to exchange Bank of England banknotes.

British Banknote Market to Stop Listing Tomorrow

British gold banknotes are one of the foreign currency transactions on the market of the Shanghai Money Exchange Association. The market announces the buying and selling prices every day. Yesterday's selling price was 54 yuan, and the buying price was 53 yuan and 5 jiao. From tomorrow, the market may stop listing the British gold banknote prices. Other US dollar banknotes will continue as usual. However, in view of the British Embassy's announcement prohibiting the import of British banknotes into the UK, and not absolutely prohibiting their use, the members of the Money Exchange Association plan to decide whether to buy and sell in the future based on the actual situation. However, the price will inevitably be suppressed by the Money Exchange.

Financial Market Unaffected

A certain person in the Money Exchange market told a reporter from "New Voice News Agency" that the amount of British gold banknotes circulating in the Shanghai market is not large. If you want to buy a large number of spot tickets, there are no spot goods available. After the news of the ban on import into the UK came out, those who owned British gold banknotes in the market released them, causing rumors to rise and the supply from all parties to increase sharply, while the number of buyers was low, and the price fell sharply. The future situation of British gold banknotes is currently difficult to predict, and there is no relationship with the entire financial market. As for the member banks and businesses of the Silver and Money Industry Association, they do not operate in the British gold banknote business, and the member banks of the Money Exchange Association only provide agency buying and selling.

### Retiring Municipal Council Staff Return to the UK to Serve

The Municipal Council spokesman yesterday denied the rumors in the Japanese newspapers that a large number of Municipal Council staff had resigned. The spokesman said that the Municipal Council had not encountered a large-scale resignation of staff. He pointed out that some Municipal Council staff resign every year, which is a very common thing. The number of resignations this year may be higher than in the past, partly because many British staff members are eager to join the military for the country, but he denied that the resignation of most senior staff was due to dissatisfaction with working conditions.

### British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr Leaves Shanghai This Morning; Stays in Chongqing and Returns to Shanghai at the End of the Year

British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, who has been staying in Shanghai for more than two months, is scheduled to board a ship leaving Shanghai at 12:00 last night and sail to Hong Kong. It is said that the ship will leave Shanghai early this morning and arrive in Hong Kong on the 28th. After a short stay in Hong Kong, the ambassador will fly directly to Chongqing and arrive in China's wartime capital before the end of this month to meet with the central authorities for important discussions. Accompanying the ambassador are several secretaries. His wife is still at Weihaiwei for summer vacation. The ambassador's trip to Chongqing coincides with the increasingly tense war clouds over the South China Sea and the increasingly serious threat to Vietnam and the British Far East territories by ambitious parties. Therefore, the general public attaches great importance to the ambassador's trip, but British officials only say that the purpose of the ambassador's trip is of an ordinary nature. It is said that the ambassador is expected to return to Shanghai in November.

### Completion of British Troop Withdrawal Today; British Warships Escort Southward; Five Transport Ships Concentrated at Wusong Estuary; Six British Warships Escort to Destination; Last Batch on De Sheng Wheel Departing Shanghai

The third batch of British troops, numbering over six hundred, aboard the Jardine Matheson & Co.'s Hao Sheng Wheel, set sail from the port at 4:00 PM the day before yesterday (Sunday). The final batch, originally scheduled to depart Shanghai yesterday aboard the British Company's Naknnda and Jardine Matheson & Co.'s De Sheng Wheel, is now known to be departing today. The officers and families aboard the Naknnda boarded last night and are scheduled to depart this morning. The troops aboard the De Sheng Wheel requested boarding yesterday. After arriving in Shanghai from Tianjin, the ship first docked at the Ruirong Dock in Yangshupu. It was only moved from there on the morning of the day before yesterday, as it still needs to load a portion of the British troops being withdrawn from Tianjin and Beijing, which are expected to arrive here this morning. Therefore, the final departure is scheduled for 4:00 PM today, joining the other ships outside the Wusong Estuary to sail south together. At this point, all British troops in Shanghai will have been completely withdrawn.

Yesterday's Situation

According to the English-language Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury, approximately 200 British expatriates in Shanghai who volunteered for the British army boarded the Naknnda today (26th). It is noted that this ship previously belonged to the British Company but has now been requisitioned by the British War Department to transport troops. At the same time, a small number of British troops from the East Surrey Regiment and the West Yorkshire Regiment remaining in Shanghai completed their handover work and also boarded the British ships in the Huangpu River today (26th), heading for Hong Kong and Singapore. It is not yet known when the five British troop transport ships currently docked in Shanghai will set sail. However, it is widely believed that these ships will depart before Wednesday. Among the expatriates who enlisted in the army today is Sampson, the former local news editor of the English-language Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury.

Gathering at Wusong

The British authorities have requisitioned several ships, including Jardine Matheson's De Sheng, Yong Sheng, and Hao Sheng, the Eastern & Australian Steamship Company's Danda, and the British Company's Naknnda, a total of five ships. Except for Jardine Matheson's De Sheng, which still needs to load a portion of the troops stationed in Tianjin and Beijing and remains docked at the Shuntai Wharf in Hongkou, scheduled to sail south at 4:00 PM today, the other four ships have successively loaded the withdrawing British troops and sailed south from Shanghai. However, according to information obtained by a reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency from relevant sources, although the above ships have departed one after another, they are still gathering and anchoring outside the Wusong Estuary and have not left. This is because they must wait for the De Sheng, which departs this afternoon, to sail south together.

British Warship Escort

The withdrawing British troops number a total of 1,750, and together with the British military commander and the families of various officers, the group is no less than 2,000. Ensuring maritime safety on this journey is of utmost importance during this time of war. Therefore, the British authorities have decided to dispatch six British gunboats, including the HMS Cricket, to escort the withdrawing British troops and their families southward. The Naknnda will directly transport the families to Singapore for resettlement, while the destination of the other British defense forces is unknown.

Total Withdrawal

After the British War Department decided to withdraw its troops stationed in China, it first withdrew 160 soldiers from the East Surrey Regiment stationed in Tianjin and Beijing in North China on the 17th of this month, who came to Shanghai aboard the De Sheng. The 1,500 British defense forces in Shanghai, consisting of the East Surrey Regiment, the West Yorkshire Regiment, and the First Battalion, also withdrew from Shanghai successively on the 21st, 23rd, and 25th of this month. The remaining 70 British troops and the final batch of 20 defense forces from North China are all scheduled to withdraw from Shanghai before 4:00 PM this afternoon.

### German Embassy's European War Films; Transported to Chongqing in Batches

The German Embassy in China has recently transported a series of films from Berlin depicting the war in European countries such as Norway, the Netherlands, and France, totaling three reels. The first reel has already been shown in Shanghai, inviting expatriates and the press. The remaining reels will also arrive in Shanghai one after another, including footage of the Battle of Paris and the German army's entry. They will be regularly screened at the German School on Great West Road, inviting people from all walks of life to attend. It is reported that, to promote friendly relations between China and Germany, the embassy has transported all war films produced in Berlin to Chongqing in batches for screening, inviting people from all walks of life.

### Counterfeit Five-Cent Subsidiary Coins Discovered on the Market

A reader of this newspaper, Gu Qi Jun, wrote in a letter yesterday, "To the esteemed editor, I am enclosing a counterfeit five-cent subsidiary coin note. I urge you to publish it in your newspaper to alert the people of this city not to accept this counterfeit currency, especially the common people. The counterfeiting of this note is extremely harmful. Although it is only a matter of a few cents, the accumulation of small amounts will have a great impact on society. Please publish this quickly to expose this heinous act. I am extremely grateful, Gu Qi."

This newspaper believes that Mr. Gu's enthusiasm is admirable and will specially reproduce the original note. However, the printed version may not be clear enough to fully show the genuineness of the counterfeit. However, the pattern of this note is crude and inferior, and it is immediately recognizable as a counterfeit. Moreover, the font of the numbers is smaller and the arrangement is uneven. It is hoped that everyone will pay attention when receiving five-cent subsidiary coins, so as not to be deceived.

### The Shanghai International Settlement Textile District; Temporarily Defended by White Russians; British Troops Completely Withdrawn and Defenses Vacated; Japanese Have Not Taken Over, and Preparations Must Be Made to Prevent Absence of Defenders

According to authoritative sources from foreign official circles in this city yesterday, the British defense forces stationed in Shanghai have mostly withdrawn from Shanghai. A large detachment of the West Yorkshire Regiment, numbering approximately 600, which boarded the Jardine Matheson & Co.'s Hao Sheng Wheel the day before yesterday, left Shanghai at 5:00 PM yesterday. The issue of who would take over the British military defense zone was originally decided at the Defense Force Command Meeting on the 15th of this month: District B would be taken over by the American military, and District D would be taken over by the Japanese military. However, the Japanese side had ulterior motives and reserved the right to raise other opinions on this decided proposal, which resulted in the American military not yet taking over District B. The Japanese side also has not yet taken over District D. In addition to District B being temporarily taken over by the A Company of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, the defenses of District D are largely vacant. The Shanghai Municipal Council believes that after the withdrawal of the British troops, District D west of Jing'an Temple in the Shanghai International Settlement cannot be without any defense. Now that the Japanese side has been slow to take over, the Council has decided that before the takeover issue is resolved, the Shanghai Volunteer Corps will also temporarily be responsible for defense. It has already dispatched approximately fifty or sixty men from half of the White Russian Company to temporarily take over the defense in the area west of Jing'an Temple Road.

### National Salvation Bonds Interest; Paid in Full Legal Tender; However, There Is No Paying Agency in Shanghai; Bondholders Can Entrust Banks to Collect on Their Behalf

The National Debt Fund Management Committee has consulted with the four banks of China, Central, Communications, and Farmers regarding the discounting and payment of principal and interest on domestic debt guaranteed by customs revenue. The discounting application procedures are now recorded as follows: (1) The matured principal and interest coupons for discounting applications are limited to the Unified Recovery Gold Long Third Bonds; (2) Each type of government bond interest coupon must be bundled into a stack of fifty or more coupons; (3) Various principal and interest coupons for Unified Government Bonds can be filled out on one form. If there are both Unified Recovery Bonds, two forms should be filled out separately. Government bond interest should be subject to a 5% income tax deduction. All holders of matured interest coupons and drawn lottery tickets for the Unified Recovery Gold Long Third Bonds can obtain an application form from the paying Central Bank, fill it out, and submit it together with the principal and interest coupons for verification and receipt by the bank, and issue a discount voucher and the first installment of the voucher payment.

Recovery Bonds

The Central Bank of China, Shanghai Branch, has recently received orders from its head office to jointly discount and pay the ninth installment of principal and interest on the 25th Year of the Republic Recovery Bonds together with the China and Communications Banks from the 31st of this month. The fourteenth installment of principal repayment for the 17th Year of the Republic Long-Term Financial Bonds will be drawn on September 10, and the principal and interest will be discounted and paid starting on September 30, in accordance with the discounting and payment procedures.

National Salvation Bonds

Regarding the National Salvation Bonds issued by the National Government on September 1, 1937, with a total amount of 500 million yuan, the third interest payment of 20 million yuan, as stipulated in the regulations, will begin on August 31 of this year. The matured interest payment has already been allocated by the Ministry of Finance from the national treasury revenue and deposited in a special account at the Central Bank for reserve payment. It is now decided to handle the payment as scheduled. However, there is no paying agency in Shanghai, so all bondholders can entrust banks to collect the interest payment from the China and Communications Banks in Hong Kong, which is in full legal tender and not in the form of Shanghai's "劃".

### Gaodeng Arrives Safely at Songmen; Successful Trial Voyage; No News of Hana Sailing to Gu'ao; Xin'anna Sailing to Fuqing Has Declared Customs

The Far East Company's German ship Hana's re-trial voyage on the ancient coastal route to Zhejiang is of great importance to the future of the entire Zhejiang route, so all parties are paying close attention. The ship set sail from Shanghai on the evening of the 24th.

Hana Itinerary

The expected itinerary is that it has already arrived at the mouth of the Ao River, but as of yesterday, Hana Company has not yet received a telegram. There should be a telegram today. There is also no news of the Italian ship Maberia, which was detained by a Japanese warship at the mouth of the Ao River. Another Portuguese ship, the Minhe, is scheduled to test sail to Wenzhou tomorrow morning. The German ship Gaodeng, which tested the Songmen port, telegraphed yesterday morning that it had arrived safely at Songmen and unloaded its cargo, so the trial voyage on that line has been declared a success. The Wenzhou Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association began registering fellow villagers returning to their hometowns yesterday. As for how to travel, it is still being planned. If the number of people is large, they plan to rent a foreign ship and consult with the consulate authorities to issue export permits, specifically for fellow villagers returning to their hometowns.

Xin'anna Wheel

There is talk of a 20% increase, but no official announcement has been made.

### Epidemic Rages in Songjiang; Appeal to Shanghai for Relief

Since entering the hot season, an epidemic has broken out in Songjiang. The initial symptoms are soreness in the limbs, fever, and more severe cases linger for weeks with persistent fever, resulting in a high death rate. It was initially discovered only in the urban area, but it has recently spread to various villages, and the number of patients is increasing day by day, which is worrying. Local sanitation facilities and the original medical assistance efforts have been inadequate in funding since the war, making it difficult to provide adequate assistance. As a result, the poor and sick are unable to receive treatment and are groaning in bed, which is extremely pitiful. The Songjiang Red Cross Branch in Shanghai and the Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association have requested Wen Lanting, Huang Hanzhi, and other leaders of various charitable organizations in this city to allocate good medicine for distribution and relief, and are also soliciting effective medicines for treatment to eliminate the disease.

### Robbers Attempt to Kidnap Infant in Chunpingfang, Hart Road; Police Arrive in Time and Intercept Robbers

A resident surnamed Mou, residing at No. 5, Lane 4, Chunpingfang, Hart Road, Jing'an Temple Road, west of Shanghai, has a son who is not yet one year old and is still in swaddling clothes. At around 8:00 AM yesterday, the wet nurse Du Ma was holding the infant in her arms and playing at the entrance of the lane when four robbers suddenly appeared. Three of them were wearing long gowns, and one was wearing a white short uniform. They drew handguns and threatened and intimidated the wet nurse. The robber in white shirt and pants stepped forward and forcibly snatched the child, and the robbers fled in all directions. A furniture store clerk and others at the entrance of the alley witnessed the situation and, together with the maid, followed in pursuit and shouted for help. At that time, a Western police officer from the Jing'an Temple police station near Hart Road, Aveneue Road, together with several Chinese police officers, were searching pedestrians in the area. Hearing the alarm, they rushed to pursue, and as a result, one of the robbers holding the infant was arrested on the spot. The remaining robbers escaped without a trace.

### Owner of Timber Business Abducted Yesterday Morning

### Handgun Used by Gang of Thieves Stolen from Chinese Police; Involved in Three Cases

At 1:00 PM on the 24th of this month, the home of Fu Zhongshan at No. 8, Renjili, Lane 433, Xinzha Road, was invaded by four thieves who stole cash and jewelry worth 500 yuan. While they were looting, a relative of Fu, Mr. Jia, arrived and, upon seeing the situation, immediately returned to the Xinzha police station to report the incident. Yang Yunfeng, the Chinese detective on duty, led a team of Chinese and Western police officers to arrest them. Because the thieves resisted arrest, the detectives opened fire, resulting in one thief being wounded in the leg and falling from the roof into the courtyard of No. 10, breaking his head and dying. The detectives seized a handgun and three bullets from the dead thief. Another thief, Gao Shunfa from Wuxi, was arrested on the roof, and a handgun, seven bullets, and the original stolen gold ring were seized. A large portion of the stolen goods was also found on the roof. The two remaining thieves took the opportunity to escape. The arrested thieves were taken back to the police station, and the dead thief was taken to the morgue for examination. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Second Criminal Division of the First Special Court. The police lawyer Li Zhishan explained the incident and requested permission for a later hearing because two accomplices were still at large. After Judge Liu Yugui questioned them, he ordered them to be detained pending a later hearing. According to investigations, the handgun held by the defendant Gao was the one issued by the Shanghai Municipal Council to Chinese police officer No. 1593, which was stolen on the 26th of last month at the intersection of Connaught Road and Yanping Road. Moreover, this gun has been involved in two theft cases in the Public Concession since it was stolen. The police are currently investigating the matter in detail.

### Case of Forged Domestic Goods Certificate; Defendant Shifts Blame to Others; Shanghai Chamber of Commerce States That Certificate is Free; Cotton Cloth Industry Association Also Issued Notice

Chen Yongsen, the owner of Zhikang Cotton Cloth Store at No. 20, Bai'er Road, Nanyang Bridge, was sued by He Bodian, the owner of Yongtaixiang Cotton Cloth Store in Qingyuanli, Beijing Road, for forging a domestic goods certificate from the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce. He hired lawyer Mao Xianshen to file a lawsuit in the Criminal Division of the Second Special Court, accusing him of forging documents and committing fraud and breach of trust, and demanding compensation of 27,840 yuan. After several summonses by Judge Li, the matter was adjourned to a later date because the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce was also investigating the truth of the matter, so the situation was quite serious. Chen Yongsen was released on bail and ordered to produce the person by a deadline. The details have been recorded in previous reports. The hearing continued yesterday afternoon. First, the witness Yang Peisheng, Deputy Inspector of the Central Police Station of the Public Concession, testified that the defendant went to the police station on July 9 and claimed that Wang Xianglin, the owner of the Bailey Company in the Hartung Building on Nanjing Road, had previously asked him to forge a domestic goods certificate, but they were all counterfeits. Now, he is being pursued, so he requested the arrest. I went with the defendant.

Wang Has Fled

Only his brother, Jin Fu, was there, and he did not know the rest. Another witness, Qian Chuntian, testified that I am a broker and was entrusted by the plaintiff to purchase goods from the defendant. It was stated that each piece would cost 38.5 yuan, including the certificate fee. Now, the defendant denies that the certificate fee was included, which is nonsense. Finally, Zhu Zijun, the owner of the Jiufu Cloth Factory, testified that the defendant was previously my apprentice. Wang Xianglin was not familiar with the store when he purchased cloth, so I introduced him to the defendant. I do not know about the matter of entrusting the printing of the certificate. Questioned, the defendant testified that he only admitted that the price per piece was 37.5 yuan. The price of 38.5 yuan on the invoice was entirely instructed by the customer and cannot be used as a standard. At this point, the plaintiff's lawyer, Mao, submitted two letters to the court, stating that since the last adjournment, he had investigated with the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce whether there was a handling fee for issuing certificates. According to the Chamber's reply, the certificate does not incur any fees and has been notified to all members. At the same time, he investigated with the Cotton Cloth Industry Association whether the defendant's Zhikang store was a member.

According to the Reply Letter

Zhikang was admitted to the association in December 1938. In this way, the defendant had already received a notice from the Cotton Cloth Industry Association that the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce does not charge fees for issuing certificates. Why would he entrust Wang Xianglin to print them? He deliberately colluded in this way to defraud the plaintiff of the certificate fee of 432 yuan. The court should punish him accordingly. The court verified the facts and ruled that the case would be heard again on the 3rd of next month.

### Police and Robbers Fight in Putuo Road; One Robber Shot and Killed

At 4:15 AM yesterday morning, someone suddenly shouted "robbers" at the intersection of Xiaoshadu Road and Putuo Road in western Shanghai. Several Chinese and Western detectives on patrol happened to be passing by and, upon hearing the cries, discovered four men in short clothing in the darkness who appeared suspicious. Knowing that they were not good people, they stepped forward and ordered them to stop. Unexpectedly, the men were indeed robbers and took the initiative to fire their guns. The detectives also returned fire, and a burst of gunfire erupted. As a result, one of the robbers was shot in the head, chest, and left leg and fell to the ground. The robber was wearing a black short shirt and pants and fell on the ground at the entrance of No. 1233, Xiaoshadu Road. A handgun was seized. The robber died from his injuries. At the same time, a Chinese detective No. 1025 from the Putuo Road police station was shot in the leg by a robber's bullet. After calling for an ambulance, the wounded detective and the dead robber were sent to the police hospital, and the robber's body was sent to the morgue for examination. It is now reported that the police have found that the handgun held by the dead robber was a self-defense handgun stolen from a Shanghai patrol officer some time ago. The case is now under investigation by the police.

### North-China Daily News Reports Japanese Robbery Arrested; Transferred to Japanese Consulate Police Station

According to the North-China Daily News, at around 1:00 AM yesterday (25th), a Chinese man, Mr. Jia, was walking alone along Zhaofeng Road when two Japanese robbers suddenly jumped out from the roadside near Zhoujiazuizui Road and robbed him. Although the Japanese were unarmed, Mr. Jia, after considering the situation, decided that it was temporarily not advisable to resist and allowed the two robbers to take the 190 yuan he was carrying. As soon as the Japanese had obtained the money, Mr. Jia immediately called the police and chased the two robbers, who were trying to escape. One of the robbers was captured and taken to the Jiaxing Road police station. However, the stolen money was not found on the Japanese man, as it had been handed over to another robber who had escaped. The police then transferred the Japanese man to the Japanese Consulate Police Station, accusing him of robbery.

### Finance: Public Sentiment Is in a State of Confusion, Engaging in Bullish Activities in Foreign Exchange

Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: HSBC quotations remained unchanged. In the black market for British and American currency, a tight wind suddenly arose. The market was affected by rumors, and public sentiment was in a state of confusion, engaging in bullish activities. It was said that the Vietnamese authorities had allowed Japanese troops to pass through to attack China, and that someone would be appointed as the Minister of Finance or Premier of the Executive Yuan. Speculators colluded, with the amount of U.S. dollars reaching over 600,000. Foreign banks absorbed British gold and exchanged it for U.S. dollars, but would not sell unless at a high price, resulting in a trend of tightening without turning back. British gold softened from 3 pence 6875 to 3 pence 625, and U.S. dollars tightened from 5 yuan 5625 to 5 yuan 40625, both closing at the tightest price. British currency tightened by 0625 and U.S. dollars by 1875. The transaction volume was quite active.

Rumors Fuel Buying Fever

In the early morning, the exchange rate was stable. The British currency against the U.S. dollar was unchanged, and it was also stable against Shanghai currency. The U.S. dollar depreciated by 25 against the British currency, but it was not changed against Shanghai currency. There was no market for French currency. The central quotations for various currencies remained the same. Banks opened for spot sales in the morning, with British gold at 3 pence 6875 and U.S. dollars at 5 yuan 5625, with British currency stable and U.S. dollars softening by 03125 compared to the closing price of last Saturday. The initial market was relatively calm after opening. It was estimated that foreign firms were doing spot transactions among themselves at 6875 pence. However, soon Chinese speculators entered the market to buy, and the potential trend turned tight. It was estimated that speculators entered foreign firms with U.S. dollars for the current month at 5 yuan 5625, reaching 53125. The official exchange rate was announced, and it remained unchanged. The balancing tax for silver was also announced, and there was no increase or decrease. After that, there were also people with favorable intentions buying. It was estimated that U.S. dollar holders were holding on to half a yuan for October, and at that time, positive news came out, such as Vietnam allowing Japanese troops to pass through, causing public sentiment to be unanimously bullish, and speculators continued to buy. It was estimated that U.S. dollar holdings in foreign firms for September were at 5 yuan 50 cents, and by around 11:30 a.m., speculators were eating up August U.S. dollar holdings at McCallister and others at 5 yuan 50 cents, and the current U.S. dollar also softened to 5 yuan 50 cents. The market was still very tight at the close, with British gold at 3 pence 671875 and U.S. dollars at 5 yuan 50 cents, with British currency softening by 015625 and U.S. dollars tightening by 0625 compared to the opening price in the morning.

Fewer Sellers in the Afternoon

The market was even softer in the afternoon, with complex rumors, and public sentiment was in a state of confusion. Sellers were reluctant to sell, and buyers were eager to buy, and the supply and demand felt quite uneven. Initially, Chinese firms sold spot orders to foreign firms at 3 pence 65625, and later, Chinese speculators and others came to buy U.S. dollars for September at 5 yuan 40625, and August dollars also reached 5 yuan 4375. By the close, spot U.S. dollars were at 5 yuan 40625, and the prior orders were at 3 pence 625. The September British gold was at 3 pence 609375, and U.S. dollars were at 5 yuan 375. Compared to the close of the previous weekend, British gold for both spot and forward orders softened by 0625, and U.S. dollars tightened sharply by 875.

### Rumors Intensify, Gold Price Increase Turns Fierce, Exceeding 5,915 Yuan Outside the Market

Yesterday, spot gold and black market prices rose unprecedentedly sharply. According to the afternoon trend outside the market, it rose by as much as 200 yuan. This was due to positive rumors and a sharp contraction in drafts, which led operators to buy vigorously. The price was only 5,730 yuan in the early morning. After securities firms and banks bought in, it rose to 5,785 yuan. However, gold firms came to sell, slightly falling by tens of yuan. Eventually, a strong buying spree broke out, and gold firms and money exchange shops all reversed from selling to buying, raising the price sharply to 5,830 yuan at the close, an increase of 105 yuan compared to the previous day. It was reported that transactions outside the market were done at 5,915 yuan in the afternoon, and the market atmosphere was unusually firm and strong. The transaction volume was quite active in the first half of the day, about 3,000 taels. Jewelry gold in silver shops finally increased by 10 yuan, while customs gold remained flat.

Spot Gold Rises by Over 100 Yuan

Since the morning, each bar (ten taels) initially had more sellers, and the market only rose by 5 yuan at the opening. Money exchange shops sold 20 taels from silver shops at 5,730 yuan. Then, securities firms and banks competed to buy in, immediately rising by 55 yuan. Silver shops traded 10 taels with each other at 5,785 yuan. Then, gold firms came out to join the bullish side, and money exchange shops added to their short positions. The market was difficult to boost for a while, and fell slightly by more than 20 yuan. Securities firms sold 20 taels from silver shops at 5,758 yuan. After that, because foreign exchange remained tight, silver shops and securities firms came to buy in again, and it soared again by 37 yuan. Money exchange shops bought 10 taels from gold firms at 5,795 yuan. Later, silver shops came to sell slightly, returning slightly by more than 10 yuan, falling to 5,780 yuan. Eventually, due to the tight foreign exchange and various positive news at the time, the buying spree surged at once. Gold firms and money exchange shops also reversed from selling to buying, and before the close, it soared to 5,835 yuan, and the noon close was also 5,830 yuan, an increase of 105 yuan compared to the previous day. In the afternoon, the market decided to close due to the holiday today. However, there was no shortage of transactions outside the market, and the price fluctuated by 50 to 60 yuan. Initially, it was high at 5,8780 yuan, and then it was as high as 5,915 yuan. Later, due to the easing of the foreign exchange market, it returned slightly, and the final price was 5,8780 yuan. The difference between the noon trade was 105 yuan. The selling price of spot gold at cash gold firms was more than 10 yuan higher according to spot gold, and the purchase price was 30 yuan lower. The current benchmark gold was more than 90 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there were few transactions.

Jewelry Gold Also Increases by 10 Yuan

The exchange rate for jewelry gold per tael in silver shops was initially still 590 yuan at Datonghang. At 11:30 a.m., it increased by 10 yuan. After that, there was no change. It was estimated that Datonghang changed to 600 yuan, and the new firms had similar prices to the above, and the purchase price was about 30 yuan lower.

### U.S. Dollar Bills: Highest at 18 Yuan

Yesterday's foreign currency market situation: Spot gold continued to rise sharply, and British and American gold pounds also rose by one yuan each. British and American gold bill transactions remained active, and market prices softened slightly. U.S. dollar bills were as high as 18 yuan 50 cents in the afternoon, eventually settling at 18 yuan 38 cents, an increase of 46 cents compared to last Saturday. This was because the news about Vietnam was very bad. Hong Kong bills continued to rise by one cent, and there was also demand for Japanese gold bills, with the evening market reaching as high as 1 yuan 46 and a half cents. Korean bills had even supply and demand, and the evening market remained at the original price of 1 yuan 08 and a half cents.

### Financial Review by Jin Shurong (Continued)

— Saint Ke Qiong

——August 24th——

Recently, the public bond market has appeared in the market with a posture of continuous rise (before the 21st). There is also an explanation of the reserve fund in Article 1 of the Provisional Measures for Managing Banks in Extraordinary Times. The general idea is that 20% of continued deposits must be used as a reserve fund, but the situation in Shanghai is special, and perhaps a flexible approach can be adopted, matching a certain percentage of public bonds in the 20% reserve fund, thereby explaining the high bond market, which is almost the purchase of funds by the financial sector. This explanation is naturally more progressive than the previous one. However, it is still necessary to consider whether it is the driving force behind the bond market. I think there are two basic assumptions that must be understood first:

The first point is that the bank management measures (please refer to the Financial Review on August 18) are general. It is better to say that it emphasizes the free China region than to say that it emphasizes Shanghai based on Articles 3 and 4, because banks using deposits without following Articles 3 and 4 is not unique to Shanghai. In fact, Articles 4 and 5 clearly focus on free China. The second point is that if this law is to be implemented, Articles 6 to 9 must be amended and implemented to suit the environment. The second article cannot be implemented alone. The management measures are a whole set of guiding, supervising, and controlling regulations, which cannot be separated for implementation. Once separated, it cannot achieve the effect of control. After recognizing these two assumptions, it can be seen that whether the law will be implemented in Shanghai is still unknown. Banks must know that their funds are safe and reliable before they can start. It is still unknown whether they will purchase public bonds as part of their reserve fund.

So, what is the reason for the high bond market? One is the stability of the speculative market, and the other is the evolution of the situation. Taking foreign exchange in the speculative market as an example, after turning tight at the beginning of the month, the U.S. dollar has been hovering at 5 yuan 50 cents, and the British gold has been hovering at 3 pence 7 cents. The difference between the spot and September forward market is very small, and there is no profit to be made. The yarn flower market is also very depressed, so funds are moving to the public bond market. If the market price differs by one yuan, there is a profit of more than 1%, which is at least an interest rate of one point per month. Therefore, it is better to move to public bonds than to stay in foreign exchange and yarn flowers. In terms of the situation, since August, the United States has been tough on Japan, the conflict between Britain and Japan has unfolded, the tension in Vietnam, the issue of defense forces, and the situation in China have all had a considerable impact. (End)

### Imported Goods?

Since the maritime traffic lines have been constrained, and due to the tension in Europe, the import of foreign goods has been decreasing. However, people in Shanghai still believe in imported goods. Of course, businessmen cater to the preferences of customers. Customers do not distinguish between the quality of goods, but only know that imported goods are good. Therefore, there are many imported goods circulating in the Shanghai market. Some are labeled with foreign symbols, decorated in a Western style, and priced according to the exchange rate. The cost is entirely the cost of manufacturing in Shanghai. Customers take it as soon as they like it, but who knows it is imported goods in disguise! Let me give an example! A certain factory recently received a transaction from a foreign firm, ordering "green felt glass plates" with white steel strips at the four corners for desks. It must be marked as made in a certain foreign country, and the transaction was negotiated through an intermediary. The first intermediary talked business with the factory, reducing the order price from two yuan per foot to one yuan and five cents per foot, but the commission (Kang Mixin) of the first intermediary was added to one yuan and five cents, so the pricing became three yuan per foot. Unexpectedly, the second intermediary (the orderer entrusted by the first intermediary) also requested to add one yuan of Kang Mixin to the cost, and it changed from three yuan per foot to four yuan per foot. The foreign firm added a huge profit, pretending it was an imported product, changed the pricing to foreign currency, and sold it to Chinese people who could not distinguish between Chinese and Western goods. The buyers still talked about it with relish, saying it was a Western product! Do you think it is unjust or not? To know that impersonating foreign goods to deceive Chinese people is unknown, and this is especially a small one. (Island Guest)

### Securities: Rumors Arise Again, Public Bonds Stop Rising Suddenly

Yesterday's security black market situation: Due to the market being closed today for the birthday of Confucius, the market only traded for half a day in the morning yesterday. The market was slightly firmer, but not enthusiastic. Neither Type B nor Type D bonds were traded. The market was affected by the defense zone issue, and new problems arose that have not been resolved. At the same time, rumors arose, so the bond market could not be smooth, and there are still many changes in the future, making it difficult to predict. Yesterday's transactions were slightly interested in Xinchang, Lianyi, and Hengfu. Scattered retail investors made up for short positions slightly. Tongxinghao entered first and then exited. Lemao sold more, and Datong also cut more. The market was closed in the afternoon for settlement, and the market price was slightly better by 10 to 20 cents. The trading volume for half a day was about 400,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below:

Stock transaction, 100 shares of Bank of Communications were traded, priced at 60 yuan and 5 cents.

In addition, the stock market opened weakly at the Public Industry Association yesterday. The bullish forces were relatively weak because there were too many overnight long positions last week, resulting in high prices for selling. However, the situation changed suddenly, and the long positions came to add to their positions at low prices, and the market turned bullish again. The loosening of silver and the strong potential trend could not be denied. The transaction volume was extremely large yesterday. The fortunes of industrial stocks and rubber stocks rose and fell on each other. Initially, it was not limited to one or two special categories.

### Yarn and Cotton: Yarn Inventory Nears 300,000 Bales, Speculative Excitement Intensifies

The yarn market continued to be firm, and the rising trend was fierce. This was due to rumors in the market that the cessation of the use of British gold pounds would benefit long positions in cotton yarn. People were excited, and a buying spree was set off. Speculators became more and more excited, buying from each other. For a time, chips were slightly scarce, and the upward pressure was even stronger. However, there was more activity in Hong Kong. However, short positions argued that the inventory of yarn in the warehouses of this port was gradually increasing, approaching 300,000 bales. Shipping to Hong Kong had been interrupted, but the long positions said that these goods were all in the hands of hoarders and would not be released for a while, so it was probably not related to the overall situation.

When the spot market opened in the morning, the sentiment was good. Most of the "scalpers" in the market tended to buy. 20-count Double Horse opened at 950 yuan, up 7 or 8 yuan. Then, it fluctuated between 954 yuan for a long time. Unexpectedly, around 11 o'clock, there were many positive rumors, and the buying spree suddenly broke out. In a short time, it suddenly jumped from 960 yuan to 970 yuan to 80 yuan. Later, after those who made profits sold, it returned slightly to 973 yuan. Today is the birthday of Confucius, and the market is closed. The scattered short positions must be squeezed to avoid risks. It was found that the transaction volume in half a day was 2,260 bales, and the market price of 20-count Double Horse rose by 30 yuan. Today, 85 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Yantai and 135 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong. The amount bought by each gang is listed separately as follows:

Hong Kong 600, Tongxing 1, Wenzhou 6406 10

Xiamen 50, Statistics 2,260

### Medicine
E Zhi Ren Arrives, Price Drops by Twenty to Thirty Yuan
E Zhi Ren (Alpinia Oxyphylla) continues to arrive, but the demand for processing it has decreased, leading to a continuous decline in market prices. Yesterday, ordinary goods were offered at 100 yuan, a decrease of twenty to thirty yuan compared to the previous day.

Hardware
Pig Lead Stabilizes
Although the pig lead trade is not bustling, the tight supply has stabilized prices. Currently, it sells for 115 yuan per dan. The largest market for this product is inland, with only sporadic business seen from local factories. It is reported that battery factories, printing factories, and paint factories purchased forty to fifty dan yesterday, keeping the market stable.

Dried Goods
New Melon Seeds Drop by Five to Six Yuan
According to reports from the producing areas, this year's black melon seed harvest is only one-tenth to one-twentieth of normal. Consequently, the prices at the source are extremely high, exceeding those in Shanghai. However, as this is a consumable item, high prices naturally reduce sales. As a result, Shanghai prices have declined. Yesterday, several dozen packages were offered, with Tongcheng seeds priced at 88 yuan, down five yuan, and Linhuai Guan seeds at 84 yuan, down six yuan. It is reported that trading companies are mostly observing prices at the source, and there is hope for easing in the future.

New Candied Dates Gradually Decrease
Since the arrival of new candied dates, shipments from Suzhou and Jiaxing have continued, causing prices to gradually decline. Yesterday, "bald" dates were selling for only 130 yuan, a decrease of more than ten yuan compared to mid-month. This is due to sluggish sales and continued arrivals of supply.

Miscellaneous News
Southern Meat Supply Cut Off
After the ports of Ningbo and Wenzhou in Zhejiang Province were blockaded, the supply of southern ham has been completely cut off, causing prices to soar. If no shipments arrive within a few months, there will be a shortage.

Old News Re-Copied
Sixty-Seven Years Ago (188)
(See this newspaper from the 12th year of Tongzhi in the Qing Dynasty)
Magistrate Commits Suicide
Several days ago, an incident of parricide occurred in the jurisdiction of Jiading County. The county magistrate, feeling inadequate in governing the people, committed suicide out of sorrow and anxiety. We record the public sentiment as follows: Initially, the position of magistrate of Jiading County was vacant, and Qi Jueshi from Dongming Prefecture, Jiangxi Province, was appointed. Later, he was transferred, and Liu Maosheng, a prefect named Lv Fen, was appointed to act on his behalf. Although the prefect had advanced through grain donation, he was known for his literary talent. His monthly assignments in the province were consistently ranked at the top, and his superiors valued him for his character. Having acted as magistrate of the county for three months, he was competent in his duties. However, a report came from the village regarding a case of a nephew killing his uncle. He ordered the local officials to await inspection the following morning. In the evening, he still put on his official attire and ascended to the court to interrogate other cases. At the third drumbeat (around midnight), he retired to a quiet room, dismissed his attendants, and widened his door. People did not think much of it. Later, a loud cry was heard. His servant, suspicious, peered in and found no sound. He knocked on the door but received no response. He gathered others and broke down the door, only to find the prefect kneeling upright on the ground, fully dressed in official attire, holding a small pair of scissors in his right hand. Blood streamed from his throat, and he was cold to the touch. The incident was immediately reported to the assistant magistrate, who was at a loss. A formal report was sent to the governor of Taicang Prefecture, requesting that a neighboring official be appointed to investigate. The prefect's family, upon hearing the news, rushed from the province. It is reported that, as the investigation has not been completed, the body cannot yet be prepared for burial. Those who discuss the art of geomancy say that the Jiading County office is unfavorable to officials. In recent years, officials have either died of illness, left due to worry, experienced the death of a spouse or child, or suffered career setbacks. Now, Prefect Liu has committed suicide due to a case of parricide. People lament his misfortune and further blame the inauspicious nature of the office.

Random Thoughts on the Responsibilities of Teachers by Jin Guang
A teacher's mouth is like a magic flute to middle and primary school students, who are at their most impressionable. The teacher blows east, and the students follow east; the teacher blows west, and the students follow west. Students regard their teachers' words as if they were imperial decrees.

When I was in primary school, I heard the teacher talk about China's rich resources, and I felt that I had to dedicate myself to becoming a mining engineer to save the country. Later, I learned from the teacher about China's vast territory and the scarcity of railway lines, and I changed my mind, thinking that I should become a railway engineer instead. Finally, seeing China's backwardness in science, and after hearing a few words from the teacher, I wanted to study physics and chemistry. I know many people who decided on the direction of their life's work in middle and primary school, and the standard for their decision was often a few words from their teachers.

It is evident that a teacher's responsibility is not trivial.

Chinese people use the term "misleading the children" to describe bad teachers, and the word "children" often refers specifically to "other people's" families and clans, reflecting a narrow family-oriented concept. In today's world, we should no longer view it this way. The students misled by today's teachers are not just the children of other families and clans, but the children of our own country, the children of society.

Therefore, the responsibility of today's teachers is even greater.

Educational Advice: A Few Observations to the Shanghai School Authorities by Yue Gao

Time flies so quickly; since the Ministry's order changed the date of Teacher's Day last year, today is once again the annual Teacher's Day. As the days pass by bitterly, Shanghai's environment seems to become increasingly unbearable. Yes, our educational field is filled inside and out with persecution and suffocation. The school authorities have been working hard to cope for the past three years, and it has indeed been difficult. However, we have always been mindful of the mission entrusted to us and the responsibility entrusted to us by the nation and the country. We dare not say that we have done our best under the current circumstances. In fact, there are many areas where we have not done enough, and we tremble at the thought that we may have unintentionally harmed our country and our nation in some way! Many of us have not properly cultivated the next generation, as entrusted to us by the nation. Some have even taken the parents' hard-earned money without fulfilling their earnest hopes of educating their children! Taking advantage of this annual holiday, I would like everyone to reflect and deeply examine themselves!

The environment in Shanghai may get worse, and the school authorities will naturally have to cope even more arduously. However, there are many affairs and facilities that concern the schools themselves. For example, when enrolling new students, it seems that many schools have adopted the attitude of "the more, the better," without a prescribed enrollment limit and without paying attention to test scores. Everyone who takes the test is admitted, which has led to a year-by-year decline in student performance! If a student does not pay attention to his studies on a regular basis and fails the exam, he will be held back a grade. If he transfers to another school, he can advance a grade. If this happens again the following year, he can transfer to another school again and advance a grade. As a result, he graduates after changing schools several times. Therefore, many schools have no repeaters. However, at the beginning of a semester, the academic performance of some secondary school students can be two or three years behind. This is the first point. Second, in order to increase revenue, schools have been endlessly increasing the number of students in each class to the point where there is no space in the classroom, not even enough for the teachers to walk around, let alone go to the back of the classroom to guide or inspect the students. Some classes have more than ninety students, and the school authorities probably understand the impact on the effectiveness of the classes, but they have not made any improvements. Third, regarding the treatment of teachers, everyone knows that the cost of living in Shanghai is so high that the meager salaries cannot cope. If the authorities' income is not low, I hope that teachers' salaries can also be increased. Finally, I hope that the school authorities will pay close attention to the attitude towards students and the connection between teachers and students. If the students have any academic organizations, the authorities should not only not hinder them, but should also try to meet their demands as much as possible, correctly guide them, and inspire them, so that they are interested in academic research, recognize their own position, and help them solve problems, so that teachers, students, and schools are integrated in terms of academics and emotions. In this way, the students will naturally love their schools wholeheartedly, and the schools will naturally flourish.

Although the environment in Shanghai is bad, we can still do many things, especially since we have a mission entrusted to us by society and the country.

A Professional Teacher's Experience by Zhu Zheng Yang

In my twenty years of teaching, I have probably had no fewer than three thousand students. Some have already achieved success in the field of education, and some have gained specialized knowledge and returned from abroad. Of course, some are impoverished and dependent on others for a living, and some are surrounded by children, dedicating themselves to being virtuous wives and mothers. But, in front of Confucius, how dare I boast? Let me share some of my experiences as a teacher.

Self-Learning - Teachers are not necessarily capable of everything, nor do they know everything, but they cannot say "I don't know" to their students. Therefore, in my twenty years of teaching, I have spent most of my time learning myself. Before and after class, I first make sure that I understand the questions that students want to know and should know, and then I go on stage. I dare not adopt the attitude of those old teachers who pick up a book and go straight into the classroom. Therefore, I feel that I have learned more during my teaching career than I did as a student. The saying "teaching and learning reinforce each other" is truly a profound truth.

A Teacher in Class, A Friend Out of Class - "Teachers deserve respect," that's right, but that doesn't mean putting on a fierce face to make students afraid, but rather making students respect you from the bottom of their hearts. For example, you know more than they do, and you are also very eager to learn, keeping up with the times, creating an atmosphere of learning. You understand their lives very well, and you not only teach them books, but also guide them in their lives. In this way, students will naturally respect you. Therefore, my relationship with students is "a teacher in class, a friend out of class." Outside of class time, I play and chat with them, treating them as friends. In this way, it is easier to understand each other, easier to get close to each other, and easier to achieve results. My students, it is said, are all afraid of me, and are afraid even when I just look at them, but none of them have not become good friends.

Don't Be a Teacher Who Does Everything - Some teachers are eloquent, lecturing incessantly from beginning to end, but how many students listen attentively? In my class, I will never allow students to listen passively. At the very least, I want them to use their brains, answer questions, and sometimes even do some physical exercises to change the atmosphere. Some knowledge must be discovered by them themselves! Let others criticize me as much as they want, I have many tricks, but as long as it is beneficial to the students and reasonable for education, why should we be teachers who do everything inefficiently?

The Homecoming of the Dancing Queen by Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter Six: A Dangerous Experience

I thought to myself that he was indeed an intellectual, clearly understanding the order of the law. But for an intellectual youth to degenerate to this point, I couldn't help but feel a sense of indescribable sadness.

Ni Jinshou replied: "Warrant? Not yet. We are still in the investigation stage. Please come to the police station to answer a few questions."

He said with a sneer: "Invite me? With a gun?"

Ni Jinshou said: "This is self-defense. What's in your pocket?" He patted the outside of the pocket of his black wool coat with his left hand. "Let's go."

He pondered for a moment, then nodded and walked towards the parked car. The car door was not closed, and Ni Jinshou rushed ahead of him and got into the car first. I followed behind Yu Gantang. His seat in the car was between us. After the car started, all three of us remained silent. After two or three minutes, he seemed to have given it careful consideration before forming a short question.

"On what grounds are you arresting me?"

Ni Jinshou seemed unwilling to answer in the car. After waiting for a while, he replied equally briefly. "You know what you've done."

Yu Gantang did not answer again, but his eyes were fixed on the back of the driver's head, as if he were trying to think hard. I was sitting close to him, and the smell of hair cream mixed with sweat was unpleasantly pungent. I thought to myself that although he was a university student, and in the eyes of most people, he was an intellectual and a future social leader, since most of his mental time was spent on makeup, dancing, and socializing with the opposite sex, his grades must be predictable. Then, can such a youth really be a leader of society? Alas! (88)

Being a Teacher by Kai Ren

In the three years of war, all aspects of China have been continuously and rapidly progressing, but the progress of the education sector has been slow, even regressing. This is undeniably a disgrace to the education sector, and this disgrace should not be hidden away as a family scandal that should not be made public. On the contrary, those in the education sector should actively work to wash it away.

This year's Teacher's Day has arrived! It has special significance. It is not only a day off for teachers, but also an opportunity for reflection! In the more than three years of the war of resistance, what contributions have teachers made? (Of course, I do not deny that many teachers are constantly working hard) Many people have gone astray due to mental distress and the pressure of life, frequenting gambling dens, dog racing tracks, drinking, playing mahjong, and even smoking opium. In the classroom, they are dignified "teachers," but back home, they are a different person. For the teachers themselves, this is a fall from grace; for the students, these people without a teacher's character are not worthy of being teachers. Teachers not only ruin themselves, but also ruin countless sincere youths. How can they bear it? There is another group of teachers who do not follow the right path themselves, but are jealous of others. As a result, two consequences arise: one is that they cause friends who usually work hard and teach seriously to go astray, and the other is that they provoke, attack, and slander others, making it impossible for good teachers to survive, unless you go along with the tide of corruption. In this situation, teachers must not only improve themselves, but also assimilate others.

Here, I would like to offer everyone a few suggestions. Teachers should be "role models." We must set an example for our students:

(1) In the negative aspect - do not engage in mindless pastimes, do not say one thing and do another, do not frequent places of depravity, do not mislead students, do not be jealous of others, do not do anything harmful to the public, do not be selfish, and do not hinder the progress of others.

(2) In the positive aspect - cultivate young students, guide them in the right direction, teach diligently and responsibly, do not only care about your own comfort and ignore the students, read some useful books in order to add to the teaching material, and you can also introduce them to the students, which is beneficial to both parties. You can also raise the questions in the book and discuss them with your colleagues, exchange opinions, and come to the correct conclusions. Study closely in group life, and do more activities that are beneficial to the mind and body.

On Errors in Opera Lyrics by Jun Mei

(1)
In recent years, Peking opera has made considerable improvements in phonology, instruments, stage design, costumes, etc. Although opinions vary, and there is both praise and criticism, the intention to correct and innovate is not entirely unjustified. However, little attention has been paid to the lyrics. Performers, due to ingrained habits, adhere to their schools and factions. Even if they are aware of the errors, they are unwilling to correct them themselves. Thus, they are passed down through generations, as if they were set in stone, with an "error all the way" mentality!

(2)
Errors in opera lyrics are nothing more than omissions, inversions, ambiguities, and mistakes. Although their impact on the entire opera is negligible, a single word or phrase can often leave people confused. For example, in the opera "Empty City Stratagem," the lines "Discussing yin and yang is as easy as turning one's hand to ensure the universe," and "Conquering the east, suppressing the north, widely knowledgeable and versed in the present and the past" are poorly connected in meaning to the entire sentence, especially the last four words of each sentence. The error is likely due to inversion. If they were changed to "Discussing yin and yang is as easy as turning one's hand, widely knowledgeable and versed in the present and the past," and "Conquering the east, suppressing the north, ensuring the universe," the meaning of the lyrics would be consistent and understandable. Everyone knows this. However, because this opera is considered Tan Xinpei's masterpiece, whether one is a disciple of Tan's school or not, no one dares to change a single word! Another example is "Selling the Horse," where Qin Qiong sings "Scolding Qin Qiong is blind, taking bandits as guests, dragging the shopkeeper lazily, in this way, we both abandon it." The rhyme changes three times in the four-sentence passage, and previous scholars have pointed this out. However, the singers do not object! In fact, Tan Xinpei's acting skills were extremely refined. Such errors would not have been overlooked. According to Lao Dan, Tan Xinpei liked to play tricks to make it difficult for those who learned from him to grasp his techniques. So, how can we know that Tan Xinpei did not intentionally invert or reverse them on occasion? This is a ridiculous imitation of previous people's errors!

(3)
As for the lyrics that do not match the plot, a single error can change the entire meaning. In "White Liang Pass," Yu Chigong is clearly wearing black armor and a black helmet, but Xiao Hei sings "Another heroic family is coming, without helmet and armor, with embroidered团花 on a black silk robe." This leaves the audience feeling baffled. In fact, when examining the original lyrics, it is "black oil helmet and black oil armor, with embroidered团花 on a black oil robe," which has no contradiction with the plot. I have also seen a famous actor singing "A Pinch of Snow," where Mo Cheng sings "Snow's wife is crying on the side." Whether Snow's wife is Snow's wife or not is not important, but it is clear that Snow's name is not Snow, so she cannot be called Snow's wife. However, the singer sings and the audience listens, without any objections. This is also a strange thing!

As for the lyrics that are so erroneous that they cannot be understood, there is nothing more obvious than "Eight Great Hammers." When Lu Wenlong enters the stage, he says, "Where should I put 元尧 to disappoint, how long will I drift?" The poem in the scene says, "One is missing in the blue and green painting, empty mountains, water and wood drift, the Yangtze River waves surge, the seawater seems to surge." The lyrics are so fragmented that even with embellishment, it is difficult to know where to

### Grains: Kunshan New Top Grade Rice Arrives on the Market; Foreign Rice Rises and Falls

Foreign rice prices fluctuated yesterday due to rumors of resumed transportation between Ningbo and Shanghai, as well as various other rumors concerning the Nanyang (Southeast Asia) issue. Moreover, the previous day was a Sunday holiday, so demand doubled yesterday. Not only were mainland merchants actively procuring rice from their hometowns, but local shops were also eager to stock up, leading to a generally active market. Prices temporarily rose by about half a yuan. First-grade old Saigon rice was quoted at 60 yuan, and "fire-twisted" (high-quality) at 59 yuan. Second-grade Saigon rice was at 54.5 yuan, and small-twisted at 54 yuan. Original-package Yinghua (firm name) Siamese second-grade rice, stored in bank warehouses, opened at 64.5 yuan. Second-grade Saigon rose from 62.8 to 63.1 yuan. Subsequently, Ningbo merchants arrived in Shanghai with rice, and local shops began to sell, but no further increases occurred. Speculators rushed to cash in their profits, resulting in supply exceeding demand, and prices fell again. While some prices still saw increases of two or three jiao, the situation can be considered stable. First-grade old Saigon rice was priced at 59 yuan, second-grade at 53.5 yuan and 53 yuan. First-grade Siamese was at 59 yuan and 58.5 yuan, second-grade at 52.7 and 52.3 yuan. Fire-twisted was at 58 yuan. Hong Kong top grade was at 57.5 yuan and 56 yuan, middle grade at 55 yuan, second grade at 52.5 and 52 yuan. Small-twisted top grade was at 53.3 yuan and 53 yuan. Tokyo glutinous top grade was from 50 yuan, and second grade was at 48 yuan. Coarse glutinous was at 47-48 yuan, broken glutinous at 43-44 yuan, and rice tea at 45-46 yuan. Daily spot rice transactions totaled 7,000 bags, while original-package rice was around 200 tons.

A small quantity of foreign rice, 519 bags, arrived in Shanghai yesterday on the Jardine Matheson & Co.'s Ming Sheng steamer from Hong Kong. It arrived at the Rossevelt Wharf on the evening of the 25th and was unloaded.

Seven to eight hundred bags of japonica and glutinous domestic rice arrived. Market rumors indicated that the rise in foreign rice prices during the early morning trading session caused a corresponding increase in domestic rice prices. However, the prices later declined slightly. Nevertheless, due to the limited amount of domestic rice arriving, sellers were strongly holding onto their inventory and refusing to lower prices. As a result, selling prices were about half a yuan higher than the previous week. Changzhou fresh pure japonica was at 67-68 yuan, Wuxi pure japonica at around 66 yuan, Changzhou Su Kun japonica was high at 65-66 yuan, lower grade at 61-62 yuan, Bo Dao Su at 62.5 yuan, Nangang original package early rice at 63.5 yuan and 63 yuan, wholesale price at 62.5 to 60.05 yuan. Glutinous rice Li Jin special grade was around 62 yuan, Chang Dan white grade at 60.05 to 59 yuan, Hong Kong special grade at 62 yuan and 61.5 yuan, ordinary at 60 yuan and 59 yuan, common grade at 54-55 yuan.

Only thirty to forty dan of Zhoupu new japonica rice arrived. Sales were quite good, and the price increased by half a yuan, opening at 62.5 yuan and 62 yuan. Kunshan new mutton fat (top grade) rice has also arrived on the market, with approximately eighteen dan sold after being milled by Zhengda Factory. The rice quality is excellent and was well-received. Wholesale prices opened at 60 yuan per dan.

### After the Influx of Foreign Wheat, Fuxin Starts Production for the Market

Flour: The flour market was generally lackluster yesterday. Since the arrival of foreign flour and wheat last week, people have become somewhat apprehensive. However, local flour mills still saw decent sales during the Mid-Autumn Festival season. Fuxin Mill, having received foreign wheat, has reportedly begun production to supply the market. The total quantity of flour released by domestic mills was approximately 5,000 bags. There was no resale of newly arrived foreign flour, and there was little movement in domestic flour. However, the futures price for the Japanese mill's Green Phoenix brand for October delivery was 14.9 yuan for 6,000-7,000 bags, the same as the previous weekend. There was no spot market for this month. Spot prices are at 14.6 yuan, and the market is showing signs of weakness.

Wheat: New wheat trading remained limited yesterday. Due to the arrival of foreign wheat at both Chinese and Japanese mills, although there was demand for raw materials, mills were unwilling to offer favorable prices. Merchants remained stable in their thinking and were not in a rush to sell, making it difficult for prices to rise or fall. Chinese mills purchased only small quantities, ranging from several dozen to one or two hundred bags. Japanese mills also purchased only two or three thousand bags, with prices secretly discounted by three to five jiao.

### Oil Cakes: Raw Oil Rises Again

Peanut Oil Market: After the turnaround on Saturday last week, the market continued its upward trend yesterday, driven by optimistic sentiment.

(Today is Confucius' birthday, and the market is closed as usual). Three hundred cans of soybean oil were shipped from Qingdao yesterday, and 143 bags of sesame seeds and 590 cans of raw oil were shipped to Hong Kong today.

The sale of green tea yesterday remained sluggish, with no significant improvement expected due to disruptions in the Moroccan market caused by the ongoing Mediterranean war. However, local red tea, handled by firms such as Jardine Matheson, Jinlong, and Goodfellow & Co., has seen some activity. The market was slightly more active than before, with over 600 chests traded at prices ranging from 220 to 285 yuan. Although there were scattered negotiations for Phoenix Eyebrow and Pearl Tea items, no transactions occurred. The market situation remains bleak.

### Piece Goods: Speculators Revive, Cloth Prices Suddenly Rise

Domestic Cloth: The cloth market rose sharply yesterday. Increased hopes for the resumption of shipping to Zhejiang and Fujian, coupled with the frequent rise of yarn prices, significantly stimulated the market. Wholesalers buying to cover their short positions, and both internal and external speculators entered the market. Absorption of dyed and gray cloth by local merchants increased suddenly. As a result, the sale price of white, bleached, and dyed cloth all rose by 0.25 to 0.75 yuan per piece. Over 1,000 pieces of various fabrics were traded in the local market.
