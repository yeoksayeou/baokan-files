### U.S. Secretary of State Hull States: U.S. Opposes Blocking the Burma Road; Believes British Acceptance of Japanese Demands Impairs World Trade, Striking at All Nations with Interests in the Far East

Washington – U.S. Secretary of State Hull publicly stated in an intelligence meeting yesterday that the United States opposes Britain's policy of understanding with Japan. He declared that the U.S. does not agree with Britain's decision to block the Burma Road, because the U.S. advocates the principle of free trade worldwide, and therefore does not agree with the blockade of the Burma Road. He believes that this British concession to Japan not only harms American commerce, but also hinders world trade as a whole. The U.S. government has notified London of this position. (Haitong Press, 17th)

Washington – U.S. Secretary of State Hull yesterday sought to strengthen British resistance to Japan's demand to block the Burma Road, saying the U.S. opposes any Anglo-Japanese agreement that is "difficult to guarantee." Hull's position was summarized in a formal statement answering reporters' inquiries about Anglo-Japanese negotiations. Hull indicated that Britain has not made a final decision, and he hopes to prevent Britain from reluctantly complying with Japanese demands. The U.S. government opposes the closure of any commonly used international trade routes. The closure of the Burma Road at the behest of the Japanese government is an unreasonable interference in international commerce. Recently, the Washington Daily News commented on Britain's actions regarding the Burma Road, saying that Britain's actions are an undisguised surrender to Japanese pressure. The closure of the Burma Road will weaken China's position and force China to submit to Japan, which will strike at all nations with interests in the Far East. (United Press, 17th)

Washington – The State Department announced yesterday its opposition to the closure of world trade routes such as the Burma Road and the Vietnam Railway. Secretary of State Hull issued the following statement: When reporters asked the Secretary of State for his opinion on the British government's intention to temporarily ban certain goods from entering China via the Burma Road at the request of Japan, he stated that the U.S. government has a legitimate interest in the opening of trade routes around the world. Therefore, the U.S. believes that the embargoes that are being considered for the Burma Road and that have recently been implemented on the Vietnam Railway will create an unjustifiable impediment to world trade. (Reuters, 17th)

Washington – Secretary of State Hull stated yesterday that the United States opposes the method proposed by Britain to end the Sino-Japanese War. Hull told the press that the U.S. will consider Britain's closure of the Burma Road an improper obstruction of world trade routes, and that the recent closure of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway is also opposed by the United States, because the United States has a legitimate right to maintain the opening of trade routes everywhere. He also made a significant remark, saying, "Let us not forget that Britain's prohibition of the transportation of military and fire materials from Burma to China is due to Japanese demands." Since the beginning of the Sino-Japanese War, the policies of Britain and the United States on Asian issues have always been parallel, but judging from Hull's remarks, they have begun to diverge. The British government must be aware of the attitude of the United States, but diplomatic circles believe that although there are superficial cracks, they may not reach a serious stage. (International News Service, 17th)

Chicago – Official sources here believe that Secretary of State Hull's statement yesterday that the U.S. opposes the closure of the Burma Road marks the entry of the U.S. Far East policy into a phase of action. President Roosevelt, when speaking to the press yesterday, did not comment on Hull's statement. President Roosevelt declined to say whether Hull's statement conflicts with British policy. However, well-informed political and official sources say that President Roosevelt must have intended to allow Hull to lead U.S. Far East diplomacy. They also said that President Roosevelt's refusal to comment on Hull's statement sufficiently indicates the U.S. government's view that the Burma Road incident is entirely a diplomatic issue and has not risen to the level of a broad national policy issue like the situation in Europe, requiring the President to reiterate his intent. Government officials also pointed out that even though some people advocate transferring the U.S. fleet to the Atlantic, it still has great significance in the Pacific. Government officials also strongly stated that the U.S. has clearly decided to adopt an active stance on the development of the situation in the Far East and is paying attention to the history of the changes in the Japanese cabinet. Secretary of State Hull apparently believes that the U.S. will maintain its strong position in the Far East and must consider any actions by Japan that force Britain to take actions that hinder world trade. (United Press, 17th)

Washington – From Hull's remarks, the magnitude of the U.S.'s concern about the closure of the Burma Road is evident. However, there is no indication that the U.S. is currently willing to take action to stop Japan's ambition to force Britain to participate in the blockade of China. Although the U.S. fleet is stationed in Hawaii, political observers believe that the possibility of the U.S. taking action in the name of national defense plans, such as banning the export of scrap iron or kerosene to Japan, is still remote. People are now watching the situation with interest and anxiety. The Washington Post expressed the opinions of people here on the Burma Road issue, saying that regardless of the circumstances, Britain's announced preparation to close this road is in fact a disguised surrender to Japan. Now that Britain has shown weakness, it is doubtful whether Japan will be satisfied with small concessions. Britain's attempt to preserve its interests in the Far East will only open the door to the complete loss of its interests. Japan's verbal promise to try to end the war within the next three months has not aroused optimism here, because everyone feels that since Britain has retreated and the United States is not eager to take action, Japan's peace terms will be more severe than previously implied. (United Press, 17th)

Tokyo – Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman Suma Yakichiro, in commenting on U.S. Secretary of State Hull's statement opposing the Anglo-Japanese agreement to block the Burma Road, strongly stated that the Burma Road issue is not related to the United States. Suma said, "This is a matter between Britain and Japan, and it is currently under negotiation and has nothing to do with the United States." (United Press, 17th)

Speaker of the British House of Commons Interferes with Parliamentary Questions

London – During today's meeting of the House of Commons, a question was raised about the settlement of the status of the Burma Road between Britain and Japan. Undersecretary of State Butler replied that the British government had recently received certain requests from the Japanese government regarding the passage of supplies through China, and that the British government had considered these requests and had made substantial progress in agreeing with the Japanese government on a specified period. News of the conclusion of an agreement can be announced at any time, Butler said. Butler also stated that a detailed statement would be issued later, and he hoped that members would not press him to answer the specific points raised. Liberal Party member Robert then asked whether the U.S. government had expressed approval or opposition to the agreed-upon approach, given the public declaration issued yesterday by U.S. Secretary of State Hull. Butler replied that he believed the U.S. declaration should be left to the Americans to interpret. Liberal Party member Mendel also rose to ask Butler if he recognized that this behavior was a compromise to the aggressor (the crowd shouted "Shameful!"), and if he thought this matter was more successful than what had been done in Munich and other places. At this point, the Speaker intervened, asking Mr. Mendel not to forget that Undersecretary of State Butler had already stated that members should not ask any further questions. Mr. Mandel did not listen and continued to speak, but Butler did not answer him. (Reuters, 17th)

London – Today, after Undersecretary of State Butler reported to the British House of Commons that the Anglo-Japanese Burma Road agreement was about to be signed, the entire House was in uproar. Labour Party member Montel, immediately after the Undersecretary's speech, called the agreement shameful. Montel wanted to explain whether this agreement was superior to the Munich Conference under Britain's policy of appeasement. Although the Speaker declared that Montel's question was off-topic, Montel continued to ask, disregarding the Speaker's calls for "Order," whether the British government would reject American goods passing through the Burma Road, given that U.S. Secretary of State Hull had issued a statement that was clearly in the nature of a protest. The Undersecretary replied that he considered this statement irresponsible. Labour Party member Robert immediately considered the Undersecretary's reply unsatisfactory and said that he would still discuss this issue during the recess. The Undersecretary said that Britain had accepted Japan's demands. (United Press, 17th)

London – At today's meeting of the House of Lords, Lord Cecil raised a question asking whether the government could make a statement on the Anglo-Japanese negotiations. When answering, Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax made a brief statement in terms similar to those made by Undersecretary of State Butler in the House of Commons, and said that because of the resignation of the Japanese government, he had been in continuous official contact regarding the conclusion of an agreement, so he could not make a detailed statement at this time. He hoped to do so tomorrow. (Reuters, 17th)

London – Chinese Ambassador Guo Taiqi told a Reuters reporter today that the Chinese people all know that Japan is deeply mired in China and cannot extricate itself, and is only engaging in intimidation. It is difficult to understand why Britain is trying to mediate the Sino-Japanese War. This move only eliminates Japan's greatest obstacle and increases its aggression against British interests in the Far East. China will not change its position under any circumstances and will not reconcile with Japan until all Japanese troops have withdrawn from China. (Reuters, 17th)

London – Last night, a Reuters diplomatic correspondent learned that Chinese Ambassador Guo Taiqi had contacted the Foreign Office two days ago to discuss the suspension of the transport of certain goods on the Burma Road. It was reported that Ambassador Guo expressed the Chinese government's concern about the possible consequences of seeking to start general peace talks at this time, and explained that the Chinese government believed that restrictions on the passage of important goods through this road were still incompatible with Britain's responsibilities as a member of the League of Nations. The Chinese government is aware of the difficulties Britain is currently facing, but hopes that Britain will make it clear that this decision to restrict freight transport is not intended to hinder Britain's future policy towards China. According to London sources, any overall solution hoped for by the British government should only be based on a peace that can be regarded as fair and equitable in China. (Reuters, 17th)

London – A Reuters diplomatic correspondent learned from informed sources that the British government is keeping Ambassador Clipper in the Soviet Union informed of the developments on the Burma Road issue and is prepared to answer any questions that the Soviet Union may raise. At the same time, the British government is also informing Chinese Ambassador Guo Taiqi to Britain of the progress of the Anglo-Japanese negotiations. The British government has not yet received a protest from the Chinese government, but this protest may have been sent to the British Embassy in Chongqing and is being forwarded. (Reuters, 17th)

Chongqing Newspapers Continue to Attack British Far East Policy

Chongqing – Chinese newspapers today continued to attack Britain's "weak" Far East policy and denounced "despicable British politicians" for attempting to sacrifice China in a Far East Munich in order to protect their Far East colonies. The Ta Kung Pao stated that Britain's permission for Japan to demand the closure of the Burma Road will not change Japan's determination to attack British colonies in Asia. Britain's attempt to sacrifice China in order to maintain its interests in the Far East has been shattered by the resignation of the Japanese Yonai Cabinet. Japan's participation in the European war to attack Britain is about to be realized, and the evil seeds planted by the cunning British will also bear fruit. The Central Daily News stated that regardless of whether the Burma Road closure advocated by Britain is for a period of three months or three days, Britain will lose all its prestige once it surrenders to Japan. The British Empire should know that it is now facing an imminent and comprehensive blow. The Communist Party's organ newspaper, Xinhua Daily, declared that Britain is planting evil today and will reap the evil consequences tomorrow. Japan has now begun its southward advance, with Hong Kong, Burma, India, and Singapore as its initial targets. Britain's past actions may be regretted too late. The Xinmin Pao even more vociferously cried out, "It is Britain who encouraged Japan to advance south!" (United Press, 17th)

Chongqing – Chinese sources here are still focused on the Anglo-Japanese negotiations. This morning, all newspapers published in prominent positions statements from Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but news from London, Singapore, and Tokyo regarding this matter was not published. (Reuters, 17th)

Chongqing – Dr. Lin Bakir, Assistant Professor of Political Science at the University of North Carolina, and son of a former advisor to the Chinese government, deeply lamented the closure of the Burma Road, saying that this closure has blocked the only remaining route for American goods to be transported to China. (United Press, 17th)

Japanese Side Declares Closure Will Begin Today

Tokyo – A Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman announced the conclusion of the Burma Road agreement, saying that as a result of the negotiations, the British government will, for a period of three months beginning July 18, prohibit the transportation of munitions, ammunition, gasoline, trucks, and railway materials through Burma. (Reuters, 17th)

Tokyo – It is reported that a compromise has been formally reached on the issue of the use of the Burma Road. This evening, British Ambassador Craigie met with Foreign Minister Arita for an hour. The terms of the compromise are not yet known. (Reuters, 17th)

Tokyo – Officials announced that the negotiations between British Ambassador Craigie and Japanese Foreign Minister Arita on the issue of closing the Burma Road have reached a final resolution, but the details of the agreement are not yet ready for announcement tonight. (United Press, 17th)

Reuters learned from Foreign Ministry spokesman Suma that the negotiations regarding the Burma Road have actually been completed. The Japanese government is only awaiting a reply from London regarding the fine details from British Ambassador Craigie. The spokesman asked that he hoped that the negotiations would be concluded under the current cabinet, which remains in office pending the inauguration of the new cabinet, which is expected to be on Thursday. If the negotiations cannot be completed by that day, then the matter will be suspended. (Reuters, 17th)

Tokyo – When a reporter asked the Foreign Ministry spokesman today what Japan's reaction was to the speech by Jones, the Deputy Governor of Malaya, the spokesman replied that, to the best of his knowledge, there were no such peace talks at present. The spokesman acknowledged that third countries, including Britain, hoped for a swift end to the Sino-Japanese War, but that the mediation expressed by the Governor of Malaya had not yet been discussed. A reporter asked whether the change of the Japanese cabinet would affect the Anglo-Japanese negotiations on the Burma Road issue. The spokesman replied no, that the negotiations had actually been completed and that British Ambassador Craigie was only awaiting instructions from London on some technical points. He hoped that Foreign Minister Arita and Craigie would hold a final conversation in time so that the matter could be resolved by the current cabinet, which is about to step down, with Britain. As for when the current cabinet will be replaced by a new cabinet, no one can predict. The spokesman then spoke of the policies of the new cabinet, saying that he expected the new cabinet's foreign and domestic policies to proceed on the basis of a new political system.

Editorial

### The Change of Japanese Cabinet and the So-Called New Political Structure

The Japanese Yonai Cabinet suddenly collapsed on the 16th of this month due to a cabinet overthrow launched by the military, just six months after its establishment in mid-January. The Sino-Japanese War has just passed its third anniversary, and the Japanese cabinet has been changed four times. Among them, the Konoe Cabinet had a longer life, but it underwent more than two partial reorganizations. Since the Hiranuma Cabinet, the average tenure of each cabinet has not exceeded half a year. Japan is at war with China, and its domestic political situation is so turbulent, which is rare for a country at war.

To review the reasons for the collapse of the Yonai Cabinet, let's first trace its formation. After the Abe Cabinet collapsed this spring, Konoe refused to take office, and the elder statesmen were unwilling to let the military seize power. Yonai, who has always been known for his prudence, emerged to form a cabinet with somewhat conservative colors. Therefore, it had a transitional nature itself, and was disliked by the military from the beginning. Although the proportion of the military in the cabinet had relatively increased, it always lacked its well-intentioned support. In the past six months, whether in military, diplomacy, or internal affairs, Yonai has not been able to achieve more than the Abe era. Preliminary victories in the European war further aroused the great impulse of Japanese radicals, and calls for strengthening the Axis ties and changing the "non-intervention" position rose high. Although the Yonai government tried its best to adapt to this trend, vigorously pursued the southward advance, and adopted an offensive stance towards foreign countries, it ultimately failed to satisfy the wishes of the military and the general radicals. On the other hand, the rapid decline of the Japanese New Party Movement posed a serious threat to the Yonai Cabinet, which relied on the established political parties. Therefore, the collapse of the Yonai Cabinet was an inevitable fate at present.

However, the fall of this Yonai Cabinet is not simply a repetition of past cabinet tides, because this time the military's reason for overthrowing the cabinet is that the current cabinet lacks cooperation with the "New Political Structure Movement," and Konoe, who is the most vocal candidate for the succeeding Prime Minister, is the advocate of the so-called "New Political Structure Movement." If the past changes of cabinets were all for reasons of policy and personnel, then this cabinet tide obviously has more political system issues interspersed in it, which is a point worth paying special attention to. The so-called "New Political Structure" issue is a variant of the so-called "National Reorganization Movement" that Konoe stepped down for a year and a half ago. This is essentially a fascist movement, and the New Party Movement is its main concrete form. Since Konoe resigned from the position of President of the Privy Council, this movement has become more and more inflated. According to Konoe's talk to the Japanese press corps on the 7th of this month, its central meaning and content can be roughly summarized into the following four items:

1. The goal of the "New Political Structure" is not only to promote the solution of the "incident" and deal with the new international situation, but also to abandon the doctrine of rapid success and establish a permanent political system.

2. Reform the separated relationship between the three powers of command, legislation, and administration and the people, form a "political unification," and use the political power of the people's organizations to control the cabinet and the parliament, but do not advocate changing the constitution.

3. To avoid being confused with the current political situation, Konoe himself is not considering the issue of seizing power, and expresses dissatisfaction with those who regard the New Party Movement as a cabinet overthrow movement.

4. The order and timing of implementation have not yet been specifically determined.

From these outlines, we can see the magnitude of Konoe's personal ambition. He not only created the "New Order" theory that makes Japan dominate the Far East, but also fundamentally reformed the Japanese political system, preparing to unite the military, political, and legislative powers that have always been separated and place them under the control of people's organizations. However, its progress steps are moderate and gradual, and there is no preparation for the use of strong force. This is naturally a very difficult task in Japan, where military power exceeds everything and there is still a strong feudal nature in society. Only because of this, Konoe does not expect to achieve success quickly and avoids confusing it with the current political situation. Thus, it can be seen that the military's sudden uprising to overthrow the cabinet during the period when Konoe believed that the "New Political Structure" was not yet mature and vigorously advocated Konoe's assumption of the post of Prime Minister is contrary to Konoe's original intention. It is difficult to determine at present what similarities and differences the "New Political Organization" in the minds of the Japanese military has with the "New Political Structure" in Konoe's aspirations. However, the "system that unites the military, government, and people into one and takes the political power of the national organization as its heart and driving force," as Konoe touted, must not fully comply with the military fascism desired by the Japanese military. Therefore, even if the Japanese military overthrows the Yonai Cabinet at this time on the grounds of supporting the "New Political Structure," even if the second Konoe Cabinet is subsequently established, it may not be able to reduce the internal friction of the Japanese rulers and form a "political unification." Moreover, the so-called one-party movement has only received the support of some parties that are in decline. In the headquarters of the Minseito, which has a majority in the parliament, although its recently announced platform also emphasizes principles such as "completing national defense to a high degree" and "establishing a national total strength system," it does not actively express its position on the New Party Movement. As for the financial and industrial circles and the figures who actively supported the New Party Movement two years ago, they have maintained their consistent calmness. It can be seen that the objective situation of the Japanese political situation is still far away from the goal that Konoe aspires to.

Japan's desire for aggression has increased dramatically due to international stimulation, but Japan's strength cannot adapt to the need to increase. Its only way out is to step up domestic control in order to engage in external speculation and adventure. The collapse of the Yonai Cabinet has hinted at the decline of the Japanese conservative camp. No matter who succeeds this cabinet, at this time, it will not be able to get rid of the strong control of the military, and its foreign policy will inevitably turn to extremes. The entire national fortune of Japan will inevitably fall into a more crazy bet.

Tokyo - The Japanese Foreign Ministry announced that Britain has agreed to block the Burma Road to prevent the transportation of arms, ammunition, gasoline, automobiles, and railway materials to China. The blockade will last for three months, starting on July 18. Today, Japanese Foreign Minister Arita and British Ambassador Craigie reached a final resolution. The solution also includes prohibiting the import of arms and other goods from Hong Kong to China. Japanese consular officials in Hong Kong and Rangoon will maintain close contact with the British authorities in those places to effectively implement the blockade. (United Press, 17th)

### Statement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs

Chongqing (Continued from yesterday) Japan has absolutely no right to demand that neutral countries stop exporting or passing through any goods transported to the enemy country through normal commercial trade routes. If any neutral country accepts this request, that country can be considered to have lost its neutral status. If the neutral country prohibits the export or passage of certain goods to one of the belligerents, while allowing the free transportation of the same or similar goods destined for the other belligerent, its non-neutrality is even more obvious. According to these unquestionable principles of international law, the British government's decision to stop the transportation of certain goods from the Burma Road to China has no legal basis and is indefensible. The trade relationship between China and Burma is based on the various treaties concluded between China and Britain at the end of the 19th century. These treaties contain clear provisions for the maintenance and development of the Sino-Burmese trade route. Neither party to the treaty has the right to close this trade route, whether in peacetime or wartime. According to the resolutions passed by the League of Nations on the Sino-Japanese conflict, all member states should avoid taking any actions that would weaken China's resistance and increase its difficulties in the current dispute, and consider the extent to which each member state individually assists China. According to the Japanese plan, the purpose of the Burma Road embargo is undoubtedly to weaken China's resistance and prevent other countries from assisting China. By implementing Japan's war plan in this way, the British government has completely disregarded its obligations as an important member of the League of Nations. Therefore, the British government's decision to accept Japan's request to stop transportation on the Burma Road is a violation of the principles of international law, the various Sino-British treaties, and the resolutions of the League of Nations. If anyone thinks that China will be forced to seek peace or even accept any conditions proposed by Japan after the obstruction of China's maritime trade routes, then they are making a greater mistake than this. Our long-term war of resistance against aggression is being carried out amidst various major obstacles and difficulties. Its arduous struggle can be said to be unique. However, our country has not felt discouraged at any time. Three years of arduous experience has at least made me understand that the firmer our will, the longer we support, the easier our goals will be achieved, and the more confident we will be of final victory. No matter what difficulties we encounter, we must move forward bravely. No matter who betrays me, our belief in victory will not be shaken in the slightest. (Telegraph, 16th)

Hong Kong. Tokyo dispatch. Konoe Fumimaro has been ordered to organize a new cabinet. He entered the Imperial Palace at 7:55 PM on the 17th and was given the mandate to form a cabinet by the Emperor. Konoe immediately accepted but requested a bit more time to organize the new cabinet. He left the palace at 8:50 PM and visited former War Minister Hata Shunroku and former Navy Minister Yoshida Zengo to discuss the candidates to succeed the War Minister and Navy Minister. Konoe Fumimaro is 49 years old this year. He became Prime Minister of Japan in June 1937, and the Sino-Japanese War broke out during his tenure. (Telegraph of the 17th)

Tokyo. Konoe Fumimaro convened his colleagues tonight to discuss the organization of the new cabinet. The new cabinet will adopt a policy of strengthening diplomacy and domestic affairs and will accelerate the end of the war against China. (United Press telegraph of the 17th)

Hong Kong. Tokyo dispatch. Observers with credentials here believe that the new cabinet will be formed tonight or at the latest by tomorrow morning. Konoe Fumimaro will be the successor as Prime Minister. The new cabinet will be a small cabinet with fewer members, with each member concurrently holding various secondary positions. The Yomiuri Shimbun and Nichi Nichi Shimbun newspapers both predict that the most popular candidate to succeed the War Minister is Lieutenant General Tojo Hideki, the Director-General of the Air Force. Admiral Oikawa Koshiro, Commander of the Yokosuka Naval District, will succeed the Navy Minister. Former cabinet councilor and President of the South Manchuria Railway, Matsuoka Yosuke, will succeed the Foreign Minister. Tsushima Juichi, Deputy Governor of the Bank of Japan, or former Finance Minister Aoki Kazuo will succeed the Finance Minister. The Prime Minister will concurrently hold the position of Interior Minister. (Telegraph of the 17th)

Tokyo. Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal Kido met with several political leaders (mostly former prime ministers) this afternoon. (Reuters telegraph)

Hong Kong. Tokyo dispatch. After the meeting of senior statesmen today, Konoe Fumimaro had an important meeting with Hirota Koki. (Telegraph of the 17th)

Tokyo. Well-informed sources here speculate that the most promising candidate to succeed Yonai as Prime Minister is former Prime Minister Konoe. If so, whether the Burma Road Agreement, President of the South Manchuria Railway and cabinet councilor Matsuoka, will have diplomatic power before the establishment of the new cabinet is a debatable point. (Reuters telegraph of the 17th)

Tokyo. Political figures here believed this morning that Konoe Fumimaro, the leader of Japan's only political party and former Prime Minister, would be appointed Prime Minister this afternoon to succeed General Yonai, who is currently resigning. After War Minister Hata Shunroku submitted his resignation and refused to recommend a successor, forcing the entire Yonai cabinet to resign, the Army Ministry is now firmly demanding that Konoe form a cabinet, calling it the only way to strengthen domestic institutions and accelerate the resolution of the China Incident. The Emperor will return here from Hayama this afternoon to organize a new cabinet. Konoe has returned here from his villa in Karuizawa. (United Press telegraph of the 17th)

Tokyo. The Emperor recently instructed Privy Council President Kido Koichi to go to Hayama to meet with him to inquire about the candidate to succeed the Prime Minister. Kido requested that the Emperor give him some time to consider the matter and then returned to Tokyo. He scheduled a luncheon with former prime ministers at noon today to discuss the matter together. Those invited included Konoe Fumimaro, Hiranuma Kiichiro, Okada Keisuke, Yuasa Kurahei, and Hara Yoshimichi. (Haitong News Agency telegraph of the 17th)

Tokyo. The sudden resignation of the Yonai cabinet caused great surprise here. According to Japanese sources, War Minister Hata Shunroku stated that the reason for his resignation was that the Yonai cabinet had adopted a too passive attitude towards the new political line. Hata Shunroku believes that in order to overcome difficulties, Japan must first implement domestic reforms. If Japan wants to complete the construction of the "New Order in East Asia," then the cabinet has the following obligations: (1) Unanimously support the national unity party as a prerequisite for achieving a totalitarian government; (2) National control of the economic system; (3) Issue official documents stating that in order to implement the political and economic reorganization of the Far East, the Sino-Japanese conflict must be ended. (Haitong News Agency telegraph of the 17th)

Chongqing. After the news of the resignation of the Yonai cabinet was received, Chinese officials here did not find it unusual, as they had expected it to fail since the beginning of Yonai's formation of the government. The Chinese side interprets the overthrow of the Yonai cabinet and the return of Konoe as a sign that the Japanese government is completely controlled by the military. Therefore, they are now closely monitoring the developments after the resignation of the Japanese cabinet. (Reuters telegraph)

### Japan's Seiyukai Party Announces Dissolution - Minseito Party Simultaneously Accepts "Totalitarian Foundation" Platform

Tokyo. The Seiyukai Party, founded by Prince Ito and existing for 40 years, was dissolved yesterday by its leaders, Nakajima Chikuhei and Kuhara Fusanosuke. Its declaration stated that party members are willing to cooperate directly to establish a new order in Japan. (Haitong News Agency telegraph of the 17th)

Tokyo. The Japanese Minseito Party accepted the "Totalitarian Foundation" platform yesterday, on the eve of the resignation of the Yonai cabinet. Its seven main points are as follows: (1) Strengthen the national character of Japanese policies; (2) Armaments; (3) Securing "national living space" and building a new world order; (4) Creating new economic institutions; (5) Implementing a universal national service system; (6) Integration of Eastern and Western cultures; (7) Development of the Japanese nation. (Haitong News Agency telegraph of the 17th)

### Japan's Future Policy Likely to Intensify Southern Advance - US Temporarily Refrains From Criticizing Japanese Cabinet Issue - Attention to Actions Towards Dutch East Indies and Malaya

Washington. Last night, Washington officials refused to immediately comment on the Japanese cabinet's resignation before receiving a formal report from the US embassy in Japan. However, political circles believe that Japanese army and navy leaders are excited by the cabinet's resignation. Political figures believe that Japanese army and navy authorities can thus pursue a southern advance policy with greater freedom of action. They believe that the present is an unprecedented opportunity for Japan to expand its influence in the Far East. Well-informed sources believe that if Konoe Fumimaro, leader of the Japanese unity party movement, is appointed the new Prime Minister, he will use his agility and far-sightedness to lead Japan's expansionist tendencies. However, observers here indicate that Japan is bound to take some sensational action. They say the US continues to pay particular attention to any actions toward the Dutch East Indies and British Malaya, as the US obtains rubber and tin from these two places. They believe that Japan's recent proposal to blockade Vietnam and the trade route between Burma and Chongqing is a powerful threat to the Dutch East Indies and British Malaya. They believe that Japan's intensification of the war against China indicates that the Japanese army is eager to end the China Incident in preparation for a southern advance. Observers say that unless Britain is defeated, the US fleet will remain stationed in Hawaii. If Britain is defeated, the US fleet will move to the Atlantic to deal with the threat from Germany. (United Press telegraph of the 17th)

### Japanese Delegation to Visit Dutch East Indies - To Discuss Economic Issues

Tokyo. A statement here today said that the Japanese government will send a delegation to the Dutch East Indies next week to discuss economic issues. (Haitong telegraph of the 17th)

### Anglo-Japanese Negotiations to Increase Complications

London. Lord Caldecote, leader of the Conservative Party in the House of Lords, recently stated in the House of Lords that the resignation of the Japanese Yonai cabinet will increase complications in the ongoing negotiations between Britain and Japan. As for the content of these negotiations, Foreign Secretary Halifax will make a speech and provide an explanation in the shortest possible time. (Havas telegraph of the 16th)

### US-China Trade Statistics - Large Increase This Year - Exports to Japan Sharply Reduced

Washington. The US Department of Commerce recently announced that US-China trade in the first five months of 1940 has improved significantly compared to the same five-month period in 1939, while exports to Japan continue to decline. The total amount of US-China trade in the first five months of 1940 was nearly US$35,000,000, exceeding the same five-month period in 1939 by about US$15,000,000. US exports to China during the same period exceeded last year by 86%, totaling US$39,000,000. US exports to Japan continue to decline. The total export amount in April this year was US$15,271,000, and in May it was US$13,721,000, which is even worse compared to May last year, as the export amount in May last year was US$21,400,000. US exports to Japan in the first five months of 1939 were US$96,300,000, while US exports to Japan in the same period this year decreased to US$91,524,000. Exports of cotton, copper, aluminum, airplanes, and machinery to Japan all decreased in May. The amount of Japanese goods shipped to the US was US$8,760,000 in April and US$9,283,000 in May. The total amount of Japanese goods shipped to the US in the first five months of this year was US$57,573,000, which is more than US$7,000,000 more than the same period in 1939. This increase is the result of increased raw silk prices. (United Press telegraph of the 17th)

### US Democratic Party Begins Elections Today - President Roosevelt Expected to Be Reelected - Farley, Garner, Etc. Participate in the Election

Chicago. Yesterday was the second day of the Democratic National Convention held here. Secretary of Labor Perkins spoke, and everyone expected Roosevelt to be nominated for a third term as president. However, President Roosevelt remained silent on his own plans. Yesterday's convention had few attendees, and the delegates showed little interest in the proceedings. It will not be until the election begins tomorrow that their spirits will be invigorated. Yesterday's meeting began with a prayer for peace in the United States and the world. Then, Mrs. McAlester, director of the women's department of the Democratic National Committee, gave an isolationist speech, stating that as women, they are opposed to war. The people of the New World should not have the racial, class, and religious hatreds that have turned the Old World into a slaughterhouse. The United States will never compromise with dictators, nor will it yield to threats. The general speeches were mostly similar. As for the suggestion that every effort should be made to assist the people fighting for freedom, it was rarely mentioned, as the Democratic Party had to appease a minority of isolationists who were even stronger than those of the Republican Party. When Senator Barkley accepted the position of permanent chairman of the convention, he asked the convention to fight for President Roosevelt's outstanding achievements in national defense and foreign policy, saying that anyone who attacks our territorial independence, interests, or anything we are responsible for defending, whether it comes from within or from without, we must resolutely resist it. (Reuters telegraph of the 17th)

Chicago. Senator Barkley announced to the Democratic National Convention that President Roosevelt had relinquished his right to seek a third term. Barkley stated that he (the President) wanted to make it clear that delegates were free to elect anyone as a presidential candidate, thus Roosevelt opened the door for his election as president. (United Press Express telegram of the 17th)

Washington. President Roosevelt told reporters yesterday that Senator Barkley, chairman of the Democratic National Convention, would use radio to announce on his behalf his views on whether he would seek a third term. (Reuters telegraph of the 17th)

Colorado Springs. Republican presidential candidate Willkie still expects Roosevelt to be elected in the primary and that Roosevelt will also be elected. (Reuters telegraph of the 17th)

Chicago. President Roosevelt's number one advisor predicted today that Roosevelt would be re-elected in the first vote at tomorrow's Democratic election. The advisor said that Farley would get 65 or 70 votes, and Garner would also get that number. Republican candidate Willkie will also get some votes. It is rumored that the Democratic subcommittee advocates non-intervention and does not agree with President Roosevelt's proposal to give all possible assistance to European democracies. It is rumored that President Roosevelt will use this platform as the preface to his entire program, but opposition has arisen from the subcommittee. It is expected that Roosevelt will dissolve all the representatives who have sworn allegiance to him in his third term. After the representatives are dissolved, Roosevelt will allow the convention to freely choose its candidates, but it will not prevent his re-election. (International News Agency telegraph of the 17th)

Chicago. Former High Commissioner to the Philippines McNutt's chances of running for Democratic Vice President immediately increased after the Trust Committee gave six seats to the six Philippine representatives at today's meeting. Another vice presidential candidate is Senator Barkley from Kentucky, whose chances of being elected have been well-known since his speech last night. He advocated continued support for Roosevelt and his policies, reiterating the promise to strengthen the defense of the Americas and to fully assist the Allies. At the same time, the convention eagerly anticipates the convention to be held on Thursday, as the formal nomination of the President and Vice President will begin at that time. It is expected that Roosevelt will be elected on his first ballot because he has 90 percent of the delegates. New York Governor Lehman, who will draft the Democratic platform's foreign policy clauses, spoke with President Roosevelt on the phone yesterday, informing him of the isolationist sentiment and urging him to give Britain all possible material assistance within the law to resist dictators. (International News Agency telegraph of the 17th)

Washington. Secretary of State Hull confirmed yesterday that he does not intend to run for president or vice president. (Haitong News Agency telegraph of the 17th)

Chicago. Postmaster General Farley said late yesterday that he would be listed on the list of presidential candidates along with Vice President Garner, Senator Wheeler, and Cummings to prevent the convention from nominating President Roosevelt again by acclamation. (Reuters telegraph of the 17th)

### French Government Decides to Move Back to Paris - Negotiating With the German Side

Vichy. According to sources here, the French government seems to have abandoned its plan to move to Versailles and will move back to Paris. Noel, the French government's plenipotentiary representative, is negotiating the relocation with the German authorities. General Petain and government personnel are expected to leave Vichy for Paris on the 29th. (Haitong telegraph of the 17th)

Vichy. The 21 Secretaries-General of the French government departments will concurrently serve as Deputy Ministers. The candidates were decided yesterday morning. Departments with heavy political affairs will appoint two Secretaries-General. General Petain submitted the list to the Council of Ministers last night, and it will be announced soon. The list of provincial governors will also be decided before the French government moves to Paris. (Haitong telegraph of the 17th)

### Germany's New Invention - Cloth Made From Coal - More Flexible and Durable Than Silk

Berlin. Germany has recently invented a cloth made from coal that is more flexible and durable than natural silk. (Haitong telegraph of the 17th)

### Sweden Allows German Troop Passage: Britain and Norway Issue Strong Protests, Deeming It a Violation of Neutrality

London: Regarding the recent permission granted by the Swedish government for German troops and military supplies to transit through Sweden to Norway, Under-Secretary Butler stated in the House of Commons that the British government has informed the Swedish authorities that this matter is of grave concern, and that this action contradicts its neutral policy. Norwegian officials here also stated that their government believes the Swedish authorities' sudden decision violates the Hague International Accords, and has therefore protested to the Swedish government. It is noted that after the outbreak of the Norwegian war in April of this year, Sweden had once banned the transit of military supplies to Norway. Now, it suddenly allows German troops and military supplies to pass through. Such a cunning and duplicitous measure cannot but be protested. Perhaps the Swedish authorities argue that the Nordic war has ended, but such a theory is untenable. In fact, the Norwegian war of independence has not ended, as evidenced by King Haakon VII's refusal to abdicate. In essence, Sweden's allowing German troops and military supplies to pass through is tantamount to aiding the evildoer, only serving to assist Germany in expanding its occupied territory. (Havas dispatch, 16th)

Stockholm, Sweden: According to the Swedish Foreign Ministry, the British Ambassador to Sweden, Mallet, presented a note to the Swedish government on the 9th of this month. The British government has now informed the Swedish government that it views the situation of German troops passing through Sweden to Norway as "extremely serious." However, the Swedish government believes that the Norwegian war has ended and that it is unnecessary to continue implementing various restrictions against belligerent nations. (Haitong dispatch, 17th)

### U.S. Minister to Australia Presents Credentials

(United Press dispatch, 17th)

### British Miners' Union Rejects Chamberlain Motion: Overruled by Majority Vote

London: Members of the Miners' Federation here previously proposed a motion advocating that government officials who support the foreign policy of former Prime Minister Chamberlain should resign en masse.

### Spain Severes Diplomatic Relations with Chile: Spanish Government Formally Announces Reasons: Accuses Chile of Adopting Hostile Attitude

Madrid: The Spanish government officially announced last night the severance of diplomatic relations with Chile. This measure was taken because the Chilean Popular Front government provided organized assistance to all Spanish traitors and adopted a hostile attitude towards the Spanish Nationalist government. This matter reached its climax on June 27th, when several speakers publicly insulted Spain and its leader Franco in front of the Chilean President in the largest square in the Chilean capital. The Spanish government's protest was met with insincere excuses from the Chilean government. Therefore, Spain decided to sever all diplomatic relations with Chile, recall its envoys and representatives, and hand over passports to the Chilean Chargé d'affaires in Madrid, Valgara.

### Italian Foreign Minister to Visit Berlin Again: Key to European War and Peace Hinges: New Peace Offensive to Be Launched Against Britain: British Side Expresses Unwillingness to Surrender

Rome: Although there has been no official announcement regarding the rumors that Ciano will be reciprocating a visit to Berlin, informed sources confirmed today that he will arrive in Berlin on Friday (the 19th). (Hai Jun, 17th)

Rome: Reliable Italian sources indicated today that the decision to pursue peace or continue the war with Britain will be made in Berlin this week. Britain's own attitude is a key factor in determining this. Italian Foreign Minister Ciano will travel to Berlin today for important consultations with Hitler, after which Germany and Italy will ask Britain, "Surrender completely or face destruction?" It is rumored that Hitler will soon give a speech at a German-Italian meeting, proposing a broad peace plan that will include issues concerning the European continent and colonies, as well as economic issues. (International News Agency dispatch, 17th)

Berlin: Authoritative sources claimed last night that they had not received any news that Italian Foreign Minister Ciano had departed from Rome to meet with the German Foreign Minister and the Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs. They stated that they believed this "would not happen," as Foreign Minister Ciano had recently been here to discuss all the latest political issues. (United Press dispatch, 17th)

London: It was recently learned from authoritative sources that in the midst of the impending German blitz against Britain, any ultimatum from the Axis powers threatening Britain with "surrender or perish" will be rejected outright by Britain. Senior officials stated that the British are determined not to surrender and are resolved to fight to the end. (International News Agency dispatch, 17th)

### Rumors Say Germany Has Prepared Everything for a Blitz Against Britain: Hundreds of Troop Transports Concentrated and Standing By

New York: NBC announced last night that they had received a radio broadcast from Rome stating that Hitler will begin his long-awaited "blitzkrieg against Britain" on Friday evening. (United Press dispatch, 17th)

Grenoble: According to the "Petit Dauphinois" newspaper published yesterday in Bern, Switzerland, the date of Germany's invasion of Britain with 600,000 men has been postponed from July 9th to July 19th, the new moon of the month. The newspaper stated, "Fuehrer Hitler believes in astrology and has therefore decided to align his actions with the will of heaven. Will this be accurate and without error this time? In any case, the date of the invasion has been changed. Hundreds of large troop transports are now anchored along the coasts of the Atlantic, the English Channel, and the North Sea, standing by." (United Press dispatch, 17th)

New York: The "Wall Street Journal" stated today that if Britain can hold out for three months, it can overcome the crisis. The chances of Britain repelling the invasion seem good, as British troops are now concentrated within the front lines, while German troops are scattered throughout the occupied territories of Central Europe, Norway, Denmark, Belgium, the Netherlands, and two-thirds of France. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)

### To Cope with German Offensive: Britain Strengthens Defenses: Unusually Tight Security Along the Coast: Walsh Appointed Commander of Northern Ireland Defense Forces

London: An official announcement stated that a portion of the area from Rye, Sussex, to Portland, and twenty miles inland, which has already been designated as a defense zone, will be closed to public access for recreational purposes from July 19th. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)

(Reuters dispatch, 17th)

### People in the British Isles: Calm and Composed

London: A Reuters correspondent in Southern Ireland reported that more war discussions are heard in Dublin in a single day than in London in a week. Every possibility is discussed. The calm attitude of the British people is unprecedented here. The majority of the Irish people pray for British victory and are determined to resist. Their primary concern is that the entire nation of Germany has voluntarily joined the local defense forces to protect the coast and patrol for paratroopers. In a village near Limerick, rumors spread that the Germans had landed in the north. The villagers chopped down trees to block the roads and planned to destroy major bridges. However, the rumors were dispelled by someone. The Irish Republican Army has been silent recently. Most of its leaders have been detained. Military sources believe that the IRA has the potential to cause trouble, but there are few party members. Defense preparations are proceeding rapidly, but there is no sign of cooperation with Northern Ireland or Britain. Although Southern Ireland does not want to join the war at this time, it is generally recognized that Southern Ireland shares the same fate as Britain. However, according to Southern Irish sources, a unified Ireland maintaining neutrality would be more beneficial to Britain than a disunited Ireland joining the war and becoming a victim of aggression.

### Italy: Issues War Bonds: 16 Billion Lire

Rome: The government issued an order today authorizing the Ministry of the Army to issue 16 billion lire in public bonds to increase the effectiveness of the Italian army. The bonds can be raised by the end of December 1940. (United Press dispatch, 17th)

### Developments in the East African War: Italy Claims Important Victory: Dolo Salient Cut Off by Italian Forces: Italian Counterattack in Libya Unsuccessful

Rome: Italian officials announced that Italian forces have achieved their first major victory in Africa since the beginning of the war. The famous Dolo Salient, shaped like a crescent, extending from Kenya to Abyssinia and Italian Somaliland, has now been cut off by Italian forces. In this operation, Italian forces have occupied four strategically important locations, connecting the main military centers in southern Abyssinia and southern Italian Somaliland into a straight line. It is estimated that this route will save 300 kilometers of travel, which is very important for Italian military transport. Military circles here generally believe that this shortening of the transportation line will enable Italian forces to take a more active offensive against the area around Kenya, including Moyale, where a large number of British troops are stationed, as well as many natives and soldiers from the former Abyssinian royal army. According to Italian dispatches, the Italian forces cutting off the Dolo Salient included regular troops, Blue Shirts, and native troops, assisted by a camel corps, a number of motorized units, and a number of tanks. In the hottest days of this summer, it was reported that refrigerated trucks were used to transport soldiers to combat the heat. The cutting off of the Dolo Salient can also protect an important highway built by General Graziani, commander of the Italian East African forces, during the Abyssinian war. This highway passes through Dolo to Mogadishu and Nageli. In Nageli, there are branch roads to Addis Ababa and Kima. Since Italy's entry into the war, British forces have reportedly repeatedly attacked Dolo in an attempt to cut off this highway, which is the main artery connecting Abyssinia and Italian Somaliland. (United Press dispatch, 17th)

Cairo: A communiqué issued here last night stated that British artillery fire in the western desert forced the enemy's motorized transport column entering Gapuzzo to retreat. A gasoline depot and an ammunition depot in Gapuzzo were hit and caught fire.

On the night of Sunday to Monday, British troops in Moyale withdrew successfully. British troops raided an Italian outpost in Gamok, Somaliland. The Italian reinforcement counterattack was unsuccessful, and the camel patrol retreated. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)

London: The Air Ministry released a communiqué this afternoon stating that British aircraft flew to Italian bases in the Mediterranean, as well as Tobruk in North Africa, Asmara in East Africa, and Moyale (in British Kenya, recently captured by Italian forces), bombing them.

Rome: The Italian High Command issued a war report this afternoon stating that an Italian submarine sank a large enemy oil tanker in the eastern Mediterranean yesterday. Italian aircraft engaged in aerial combat with enemy aircraft over Malta yesterday, shooting down two enemy aircraft while losing one of their own. Italian aircraft bombed the port of Alexandria, achieving considerable success. In North Africa, Italian aircraft bombed airfields and barracks in Matruh and Barrani, achieving great success. Enemy forces launched a fierce attack on the fort of Gapuzzo, mobilizing fifty tanks in an attempt to attack our positions under the cover of heavy fog, but were repelled by our forces. Enemy aircraft repeatedly bombed Tobruk last night, but the damage was minimal. In East Africa, Italian forces occupied several key points near the border of Italian Somaliland, capturing much military equipment and many prisoners. The village of Moyale in Kenya has been occupied by our forces. Enemy aircraft bombed Agordat and Asab, causing little damage. One of our submarines has not returned to base.

Details of Italian Aircraft Bombing Haifa Port

Rome: Regarding the Italian air force bombing of Haifa, an important British naval and air base and the terminus of oil pipelines in Palestine: Italian aircraft had to fly for five hours to reach Haifa and avoid the British reconnaissance station on Cyprus. In addition, there were obstacles of visibility and semi-tropical temperatures. When Italian aircraft arrived at Haifa, British anti-aircraft guns along the coast and mountains immediately opened dense fire, but Italian aircraft still attacked oil depots and airfields. All targets were hit and caught fire. When British fighters took off to intercept, Italian aircraft had already completed their mission. The success of the Italian air force was remarkable, as Haifa Port is hundreds of kilometers away from the nearest Italian air force base. On the return journey, the aircraft personnel could still see the flames of the oil pools in the distance. (Haitong dispatch, 17th)

### The Past and Present of the China-Burma International Transportation Route

Currently, the 150 miles from Lashio to the Chinese border prohibit heavy trucks from passing during the day, but private cars can travel freely along the entire route. The bridges spanning the Mekong and Salween Rivers are modern bridges made of copper and iron. In fact, transportation is not limited to one road, except for the narrow valleys between rivers. The main road is 100 miles south of Tengyue, but another road to Bhamo passes through Tengyue city. Similarly, within Burma, vehicles can reach the Chinese border via the rail lines outside Namhkam, Muse (transliteration), and Kunlong ferry. There is also a road via Kaitong (transliteration), which is longer than the other roads, and further north, many vehicles come from Myitkyina, the terminus of the railway.

The Chinese are dissatisfied with the transportation on the Burma Road and have begun building a railway. The section from Kunming to Chuxiong is expected to be completed in July of this year. According to recent news, Chairman Chiang has ordered the completion of the section from Chuxiong to the Burmese border this year. The Chinese engineering office estimates that the cost of building the railway within China, including 200 tunnels, will be £4 million. If this road is completed, it can carry 300 tons of cargo per day, a volume no less than that of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway.

Six months after construction began on the new highway, the British ship Stanholme carried 6,000 tons of Soviet munitions from Odessa to Rangoon for transshipment to China. In October 1938, the munitions were unloaded from the ship and transported to Lashio. The Burmese nationalist "Dobama Asiayone" party immediately protested to Burmese Governor Sir Cochrane, stating that this action risked drawing Burma into the Sino-Japanese war. Later, when four more ships arrived with munitions for transshipment to China, the munitions were transported by small boats along the river to Bhamo instead of being transported by the state railway.

The news of five ships of munitions being transported from Rangoon to China alarmed Japan. Before the first shipment of munitions arrived, the Japan Chronicle reported in June 1938 on the news of transporting goods to China through Burma and the plan to secretly build a railway from Myitkyina to Yunnan. In the summer of 1938, Burmese newspapers reported that the Japanese consul in Rangoon had stated that if the new highway was used for transporting munitions, Japan would bomb it. He also warned that Japan would not be responsible for compensation if bombs were mistakenly dropped on Burmese territory. Although the Japanese consul was later transferred, and although Burmese nationalists sympathized with China's resistance, they were very hostile to the new highway.

Although no one dares to say that Japan cannot destroy the Burma Road, it is at least very difficult. Although Japanese bombers have reached Kunming, the Burma Road and the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway have not suffered significant damage. It is also unimaginable militarily to advance from the southwest to reach the Burma Road. It is 1,000 miles from Guangzhou or Beihai to reach the Burma Road, a region full of miasma, where 40% of the workers of the French railway company die each year from miasma-related diseases. In addition, the area is mountainous, and most of the area has no roads or navigable waterways. If Japan were to carry out this move, it would first have to control Hunan, Guizhou, and Guangxi.

The highway is currently the most important and beneficial transportation undertaking between China and foreign countries. In practice, this highway is more useful than the Northwest Highway. Although its current value is only for emergency military use, its commercial benefits are infinite. Perhaps the construction of the new highway and new railway will provide Britain with a direct passage to the Chinese interior, reducing transportation costs and allowing it to compete with Japanese goods and stand on an invincible position. On the other hand, in addition to importing important military supplies, China can also export goods to earn the foreign exchange needed to purchase munitions for China. (End)

### Yesterday's Naval Battle at Zhenhai Port; Ningbo and Shaoxing People Remain Calm; Chinese Military Defenses Firm Along the Coast and River; No Significance to the Abandonment of Qiliji Island; Italian Consulate Negotiates Resumption of Navigation, Japan Claims Blockade is Temporary

A telegram from Ningbo yesterday stated that at 8:00 AM "Ning'an," and at 4:00 PM "situation tense," "evacuate the population." It was also reported that after Japanese troops began military operations in Hangzhou Bay, they landed on barren islands such as Qiliji, attempting to land at Zhenhai. However, they were fiercely repelled by the garrisoned troops and have not succeeded. A large Chinese army is gathered along the coast and river, taking emergency measures and declaring a state of special alert. Defenses are exceptionally solid. People in Ningbo and other places are calm. It is understood that Qiliji is a barren island with a customs lighthouse located seven miles from the entrance to Zhenhai Port, and has no military significance.

Japanese Warship Hit in Zhenhai Naval Battle

A reporter from the Datong News Agency obtained reliable information from the shipping industry that a fierce naval battle occurred again yesterday morning at Zhenhai Port. Six Japanese planes also took off from the Longshan area and dropped bombs on the Zhenhai fortress area of Zhaobao Mountain and Jinji Mountain. However, all bombs landed in open areas and caused no major damage. According to a reporter from the Dazhong News Agency who learned from a ship's crew member who arrived in Shanghai from Ningbo the night before last, at 5:30 AM on the 16th, when the ship was about to enter Zhenhai Port, they saw about ten Japanese warships and more than thirty motorboats lined up in the Longshan to Zhenhai area. At that time, a Japanese warship, seeing a ship approaching, immediately signaled for it to stop. After a while, a Japanese motorboat carrying seven Japanese soldiers approached the ship. Four soldiers boarded the ship to inspect it and notified the shipowner, saying, "War is about to break out, leave quickly." Fortunately, the ship had already unloaded its cargo, so it turned around and sailed to Shanghai. Immediately afterward, a huge rumbling sound was heard, like a string of pearls. Four Japanese planes circled over Zhenhai, dropping bombs. Suddenly, a deafeningly loud cannon shot was heard, fired from the Zhenhai battery. Following that was a huge explosion. A Japanese warship was seen to have been hit by the Chinese, and its hull was tilting as if about to sink. The warship next to it approached to rescue it and assist it in sailing away. At this time, the ship had gradually sailed away, and the density of Japanese warship gunfire also decreased sharply.

Rumors of Results in Italian Consulate Negotiation

Since the Japanese military announced the blockade of the coastal ports of Zhejiang and Fujian, the impact on British and Italian shipping merchants has been even greater. Shipping merchants from various countries in this port gathered separately to discuss and request their respective consuls-general in Shanghai to negotiate for the resumption of navigation. Therefore, the British Consulate presented a strong protest, but as of yesterday, there were still no results. However, according to authoritative sources in the shipping industry, after the Italian Consulate negotiated with the Japanese side, they claimed that the blockade was temporary in nature. Once the military operations in Zhenhai cease, there is hope for the resumption of navigation. According to The Times, regarding the sudden decision by the Japanese side to blockade the Zhejiang and Fujian coasts, the British authorities filed a strong protest on Sunday, and are now watching the development of the situation. Naval authorities at the British Embassy have not issued any critical messages, reportedly because it is too early. The British authorities have not instructed British ships not to sail to the blockaded ports, but it is generally expected that ships will not go.

Japanese Warships Gather in Zhoushan Waters

Furthermore, a telegram received yesterday from relatives in Ningbo stated that the waters off Andong in Yuyao were also reportedly bombarded by Japanese warships. The Shaoxing Seven Counties Association stated that they had not received reliable reports of the bombardment of Yuyao by Japanese warships. As for Shaoxing, it is said to be peaceful, and no disturbing news has been heard. In addition, Japanese warships have suddenly gathered near Weitou Port in Dinghai on the Zhoushan Islands, seemingly intending to use Dinghai as a base for harassing the coastal areas of eastern Zhejiang. According to telegrams received by the shipping industry, there are currently a total of five large and small Japanese warships and one aircraft carrier anchored in the waters around Zhoushan Island. The Kushimao Unit of the Japanese naval landing forces stationed in Dinghai city is also frequently deployed, and on the 11th, they took a ship to spy on Chuanshan in Zhenhai. Recently, reinforcements have continued to arrive, planning to depart from Dinghai and invade eastern Zhejiang.

Emergency Measures for Defenses Along All Rivers

The Japanese troops entrenched in Fuyang and Xiaoshan are trying to make trouble again. Japanese troops in Fuyang are attempting to secretly cross the Fuchun River, and Japanese troops in Xiaoshan are attempting to advance south along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. Chinese troops in various locations are standing by, ready to strike hard. It is reported that the × Army Group × Commander-in-Chief has ordered his subordinates to be on strict alert and to strengthen the blockade of the Yong River, Jiao River, and Ou River. The Jiang Defense Commander on the south bank of the Qiantang River has adopted emergency measures.

Ningbo Reports on Previous Battle Situation

According to a telegram from Ningbo to the Shanghai Ningbo Community, the circumstances of the Japanese aircraft and warships harassing Zhenhai on the 16th are as follows: Twenty-three Japanese warships fired more than 200 shells at Zhenhai, and six Japanese planes dropped 71 bombs on the Zhenhai fortress area, all of which landed in the open fields. We suffered no losses. Japanese warships in Hangzhou Bay also shelled Andong, a coastal town in Yuyao, the day before yesterday, but the extent of the damage has not yet been reported. As of last night, the Japanese warships outside Zhenhai Port were still lingering and have not left, and transport ships have arrived, their intentions are difficult to predict. According to foreign ship crew members who arrived in Shanghai, when the ship arrived at Ligang, they discovered eight Japanese warships anchored outside the port, and later three more arrived, totaling eleven. In addition, there were more than ten transport ships, all fully loaded with Japanese soldiers, as well as small motorboats. Judging by the Japanese's attitude, they seem to have landing intentions. Inside Ningbo Port, there is a German merchant ship, the "Kaysersten," owned by Jebsen & Co., which is being repaired in Ningbo and therefore cannot leave. It is currently blockaded in Ningbo.

Ewo Liners Sail to Fujian as Usual

The Shanghai-Fujian liners, including the four Ewo Line ships of British Merchants, "Sinfuk," "Sinhwa," "Sinwoo," "Sina," etc., except that "Sinwoo" and "Sina" have safely arrived in Quanzhou, the "Sinfuk" and "Sinhwa" are staying in Shanghai. According to a reporter from the Ping Ming News Agency who inquired with the company, the matter of the company's ships suspending services has been discussed and agreed upon by the relevant authorities with the Japanese side. The ships are sailing as usual. "Sinfuk" is scheduled to leave Shanghai at 8:00 AM today to sail to Xinghua Bay in Fujian, and customs clearance was completed yesterday. It will sail to Fujian this morning. The "Sinhwa," which is currently in Shanghai, will also sail to Xinghua, Fujian, within the next week.

Food Transported to Shanghai Will Not Be Intercepted

Shanghai Times says that, as of yesterday (the 16th), the coast of Zhejiang and Fujian provinces has been blockaded by the Japanese Navy since midnight on Monday, and Shanghai will not be greatly affected. The supply of fresh fruits, vegetables, and poultry will also not be cut off. According to those who supply food to the two concessions, Shanghai has been shipping in fresh fruits and vegetables from the mouth of the Yangtze River, and poultry has been coming from the Nanjing area for months. If the Japanese decide to include fish in the blockade, then Shanghai will likely experience a fish shortage.

Ticket Refunds Begin Yesterday for Suspended Ships

Refunds for tickets sold for the four ships that were suspended from sailing from Shanghai to Ningbo the day before yesterday began yesterday. The loaded cargo remains in the ships. However, the "Changde," a ship managed by the Jufeng Customs Brokerage and leased from the Italian merchant Roche Company, has suffered heavy losses since the suspension of service, so it plans to unload the cargo and return the ship to the shipowner. However, there is a shortage of warehouses, so it is currently seeking to rent one.

### British Ambassador Continues Working in Shanghai; Rumor of Trip to Chongqing is Inaccurate

In the past two days, a rumor has been circulating in Shanghai that British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr left Shanghai for Chongqing the day before yesterday. According to inquiries made by reporters to the British Embassy, a spokesperson for the embassy firmly denied this, saying, "The Ambassador is currently working in Shanghai as usual. The rumor of his trip to Chongqing is absolutely inaccurate, as the Ambassador currently has no plans to leave Shanghai. As for the Ambassador's wife, she has left Shanghai for Beidaihe to escape the summer heat."

### No Discussion Yesterday Between Both Parties Regarding Japanese Military Police Incident; Japan Demands Sincere Measures From US; Joint Statement May Be Released Today

The North China Daily News says that there is no prospect of an imminent resolution to the accidental incident between the US Marines and Japanese Military Police on July 7. According to well-informed sources yesterday (the 16th), Major General Miura, commander of the Japanese Military Police, and Colonel Baker, commander of the 4th US Marine Regiment, met yesterday but there was no new development. At yesterday's meeting, Major General Miura pointed out that sixteen plainclothes Japanese Military Police officers were mistreated by US soldiers in this case, and insisted that the responsible US authorities should take sincere measures to resolve the case. It is reported that as of yesterday, the Japanese side had not received a satisfactory response, so the problem remains unresolved. Observers say that the developments in the next few days are of particular significance. The China Press says that Colonel Baker and Major General Miura have not yet issued a joint statement on this matter, but it will likely be released tomorrow (the 18th). The two did not continue discussions this morning.

Filipino Americans Take a Stern Attitude

A spokesperson for the Japanese Embassy said last night at a reception for journalists that the declaration by US residents in Manila requesting Colonel Baker to issue greater authority in the case of the arrest of Japanese Military Police on the third week anniversary of July 7 is considered by the Japanese authorities in Shanghai to be unhelpful in resolving the case, but rather makes the situation even more serious. The spokesperson believes that the mistreatment of the sixteen Japanese Military Police officers should be carefully handled. When asked by reporters whether the meeting of Japanese people in Hongkou was "helpful" in resolving the case, the spokesperson replied that the meeting of Japanese people in Hongkou and the meeting of Americans in Manila are different. The Americans in Manila telegraphed US Secretary of State Hull and Colonel Baker, but the meeting of Japanese people in Hongkou expressed the emotions of Japanese residents in Shanghai, and Shanghai is more familiar with the situation in this case than Manila. The Japanese military spokesperson continued that the meeting between Colonel Baker and Commander Miura is still in progress, but stated that no statement has been issued.

### Closure of Yunnan-Burma Road Does Not Affect Chinese Military

British Move Seems to Contain Exchange Effect; Chinese Military Has Large Stockpile of Munitions; British People Arriving in Shanghai From Hong Kong Describe the General Situation

A certain British merchant who recently arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong told reporters yesterday that even if the Burma Road is closed for three months, it will not have much impact on the transport of munitions to Chongqing. This is because the road is "closed" for three months every year in July, August, and September. At this time, many of the bridges along the road are washed away by intense tropical rains, and many sections of the road cannot be used by trucks. He has traveled to Burma several times, so he knows it quite well.

No Impact From Three-Month Closure

The British person also said that the Chongqing government has planned for this for a long time, so it stores enough munitions before each rainy season so that military operations will not be delayed. Therefore, closing the Burma Road for three months at this time is not of much importance. He continued that well-informed British sources believe that even if the Burma Road is closed, the period will be no more than a month. However, this concession will ease Japan's hostility in the Far East and provide an exchange effect, enough to prevent Japanese goods from being transported to Germany via Dalian. These goods are currently being transported to Germany via Siberia, some of which were originally shipped from the United States to Japan, and many products produced in Japanese-occupied areas are also being transported to Germany.

Crisis in Hong Kong No Longer Considered

The British person also said that the Hong Kong authorities and well-informed private sources do not believe that Japan will make further demands at this time or impose a blockade on Hong Kong, and the threat of a military attack on Hong Kong has also faded. He said that it would be meaningless for Japan to declare war on Britain at this time. First, the United States would immediately impose a full embargo on Japan, and Japan would not be able to withstand this blow. Second, Japan's massive merchant fleet would no longer be able to maintain its maritime security. Japan's credit would immediately falter, and it would no longer be able to sell its cheap goods on the world market. The British merchant pointed out that if Japan declared war on Britain, even if the United States did not immediately enter into conflict with it, its entry into the Axis powers would inevitably lead to the loss of the world trade market. Therefore, the Hong Kong authorities believe that the current crisis will soon dissipate. The evacuation of British women and children from Hong Kong was not voluntary, but was ordered, and everyone thought that this move was unnecessary. It is said that the Hong Kong authorities even telegraphed the London War Office to request the revocation of the order for the evacuation of women and children.

Street Market Prosperous As Before

As for the appearance of Hong Kong city, it has not changed at all. Road traffic is still crowded. Movie theaters, cafes, etc., are still overcrowded. The evacuation of 4,000 British women and children has not changed Hong Kong at all. Business transactions are as usual. Although the evacuation of women and children is a common topic of conversation, most people are not surprised by it, but rather resent it. Although Hong Kong remains calm, it does not slacken its defensive preparations of a precautionary nature. British people between the ages of eighteen and fifty-five, and some other nationalities, have registered as volunteers and receive training once a week. It is said that the British Royal Naval Reserve has also been fully mobilized.

### Assessment of Rice Prices; Highest Price for Foreign Rice Has Reached 60 Yuan

The Shanghai Rice Price Evaluation Committee issued its fourth public announcement yesterday. The committee has assessed the highest market prices for buying and selling starting from the 17th of this month. No. 1 Saigon Siamese 59.5 yuan, Fire-Refined 59 yuan, No. 2 Saigon Siamese 57 yuan, Small-Refined 57 yuan, High Tokyo White Rice 54 yuan, Tokyo Brown Rice 50 yuan, Rice Lu 48 yuan, Mixed Broken Rice 44 yuan. No. 1 Saigon Siamese has increased by a total of 4 yuan, Fire-Refined 4 yuan, No. 2 Saigon Siamese 4.5 yuan, Small-Refined 4 yuan, High Tokyo Milled Rice 5.5 yuan, Tokyo Brown Rice 6 yuan, Rice Lu 5.5 yuan, Mixed Broken Rice 5 yuan. The highest price for foreign rice has now reached 60 yuan, and the market is full of existing stock, people are psychologically fatigued, and buyers seem to be waiting and seeing. Therefore, rice prices at various stalls are expected to continue to decline.

### High Tides in Huangpu River Starting Today; Pacific Hurricane in Stagnant State

High tides will occur in the Huangpu River starting on the 19th. According to the Huangpu River Conservancy Bureau, the height is predicted to be around eleven feet. Currently, there is a hurricane in the Pacific Ocean, and if it coincides with the high tides, Shanghai will face a fairly serious flood. Therefore, riverside godowns and warehouses have attracted attention, and flood defense works have been strengthened.

According to a report from the Observatory, the Pacific hurricane reached 16 degrees north latitude and 138 degrees east longitude at 2:00 PM the day before yesterday, and then entered a stagnant state. At 6:00 AM yesterday, it was still lingering in the same place. The center of the storm is large, within 120 nautical miles. The strength of the wind is unknown. Its development is currently being monitored.

### Indians Pledge Allegiance to Britain; Indian Church Bishop Arrives in Shanghai for a Short Talk

The chairman of the Indian Church, Jai Singh Bhai, arrived in Shanghai yesterday aboard the President Adams mail ship from the United States. He told reporters that if Britain is not subdued by Germany, India will remain loyal to the British Empire. Indians hate British imperialism, but they abhor Hitlerism even more. Although we have not given up the struggle for independence, we do not want to be conquered by Germany, Soviet Russia, or Japan. Mr. Jai said that this view represents the most powerful view among Indian leaders. In other words, India's immediate priority is defense, and independence is not yet the time. He said that if Britain collapses, India will be unimaginable. Therefore, for India's sake, it is hoped that Britain will win, and after the war ends, the British will eventually give India dominion status, and then complete independence. If India wants to be independent, it must first be unified. Christianity is a factor in helping India to unite. Ten years ago, there were eight million Christians in India, double the number of twenty years ago, and it is still increasing. Christianity not only represents a new spirit in India, but also an economic and social revolution.

### Property Valuation Should Not Be Too High; So That Gradual Adjustments Can Be Made; To Restore Reasonable Normality

The Municipal Council issued a report that after the war, secondary landlords have raised rents, according to the cost of living index, to a high increase of 205%. The authorities have paid close attention to it. All parties deeply hope that the excessive profits of secondary landlords can be strictly restricted in the future. The authorities should also avoid excessively high valuations of certain houses for tax purposes, so that the rent problem can be gradually adjusted and restore a reasonable normality.

### No Celebrations Held for Spanish National Day Today

Today is the National Day of Spain. The Spanish Consul General in Shanghai, Yegar, has left Shanghai, so there are no plans to hold celebrations. It is rumored that he will return here from Dalian soon.

### Adams Ship Delayed Due to Storm; Detours Via Shanghai Back to US

The world-class mail ship of the American President Lines, President Adams, was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 16th from the United States, but was delayed until yesterday morning (the 17th) at 11:00 AM due to a hurricane encountered near the Japanese sea. Due to the situation in the Far East, the number of passengers has decreased sharply compared to before. After staying in Shanghai for one day, it will leave Shanghai at 1:15 AM on the 19th (i.e., midnight tonight) for Hong Kong, Manila, via Singapore, Colombo, Mumbai, detour Cape of Good Hope, (not to the Mediterranean Sea) back to New York. The passenger tender is scheduled to depart from the Customs Jetty at 12:15 AM midnight tonight.

### Japanese Chief Inspector of Shanghai Municipal Council; Iwashita to Retire Regularly

Iwashita, the Japanese Chief Inspector of the Shanghai Municipal Police Department, will retire on October 20th of this year. The reason for Iwashita's retirement is unknown, but it has been approved by the Municipal Council's Personnel Committee. Recently, six Western police officers of the Police Department have decided to resign. The resignation dates are from the 4th of this month, and some are delayed until December 18th of this year. The counts are Deputy Inspector Robinson, Patrol Chief Pruen, and four probationary patrol chiefs, namely Redell, Knox, Knight, and Dalzi.

### Moller Company Has Not Moved to Hong Kong

The Japanese newspaper "Dairiku Shimpo" published a message yesterday saying that all the larger ships of the British Moller Shipping Company in Shanghai would be moved to Hong Kong by the end of August. A spokesperson for the shipping company has declared that this news is purely a fantasy.

### A Heart-Stopping Scene; Fishermen Escape From Death; British Ship Rescues in Extreme Danger; Second Mate Endures Hardship in High Waves and Dark Night; Passengers Donate 400 Yuan to Send Fishermen Back to Shantou

The North China Daily News says that a British ship arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong yesterday (the 16th). Passengers described the heroic rescue of eight Shantou fishermen from a sinking ship by the ship's crew members before dawn on the 15th, and their admiration was overflowing. The story is as follows:

Fishing Boat in Critical Situation Due to Storm

Eight Shantou fishermen, including a twelve-year-old child, sailed out to sea on a sailboat on the 14th. They encountered a hurricane, the masts collapsed, and there was a hole in the bottom of the boat. The fishermen could not control the boat and drifted with the wind. Until dusk, the boat was hit by huge waves and sank further.

Green Light Flickers, Seeking Help in the Black Sea

At about 11:00 PM that night, the British ship was sailing through the angry waves. Due to wartime regulations, no lights were on the ship, and only a very faint green light flickered on the deck. It passed a few feet away from the sailboat. The fishermen saw it and shouted for help. The passengers in the hold were awakened by the shouts.

Raging Waves Made Rescue Impossible

Captain MacCleay, knowing that someone was in danger, quickly ordered the ship to stop and directed the rescue work. At this time, everything was dark, and only a crescent moon pierced through the clouds, with a glimmer of light illuminating the sea. MacCleay tried to bring the ship close to the half-submerged sailboat, and the crew prepared lifebuoys. However, the waves were raging, and the sailboat floated past the ship four times, and it was impossible to rescue them. The fishermen were not seen in the darkness, and only the mournful cries of the fishermen were heard amid the sound of the surging sea.

Second Mate Leads Small Boat for Personal Search and Rescue

The captain decided to launch a small boat. Within seconds, the boat was lowered from the davits and a searchlight was turned on, but still nothing was found. Finally, the boat was put into the sea, and the second mate Bains led the crew to embark on a dangerous mission. At that time, dense clouds covered the moon, the light was faint, and the small boat crew responded to the cries of the fishermen and conducted a search. After two hours, the passengers on the deck of the British ship watched with bated breath, but because it was completely dark, the small boat had disappeared, so nothing could be seen.

Arriving in Time, Fishermen Escaped Danger

Then, the second mate's searchlight flashed, sending out a signal of rescue. The small boat had finally arrived in time to rescue the fishermen, and the sailboat sank shortly after. When the small boat approached, the wind and waves were still fierce, and it almost capsized. Towing the boat onto the ship was also very difficult. After three hours, everything was completed, and the British ship continued to sail to Shanghai.

Clothes, Wine, and Food Like Celebrating a New Life

The fishermen were exhausted, and the ship's purser, Stokes, treated them with wine and food and gave them clothes. The fishermen said that they had been drifting aimlessly since 5:00 AM, and two ships had passed by, but they had not noticed that they were in danger. The next morning, the fishermen recovered their spirits, and the passengers took pity on them and donated 400 yuan, which will be used to send them back to Shantou from Shanghai.

### Japanese Merchants Plan to Merge Docks; Shanghai Municipal Council Protests; This Action Impedes the Use of Public Docks; However, the Japanese Have Already Built a Wall at the Intersection of Edinburgh Road

The China Press says that a spokesperson for the Municipal Council told reporters this morning (the 17th) that the Municipal Council has protested to the Japanese authorities in Shanghai regarding the Japanese plan to merge the Japanese docks along Yangshupu Road. This action will prevent the public from freely entering and exiting the public docks between the docks of the Japan, Osaka, and Dairen Steamship Companies. When asked if the Japanese military authorities had blocked Edinburgh Road from the Edinburgh Public Dock to Yangshupu Road, the spokesperson replied in the affirmative. The Japanese authorities have built a wall at the intersection of Edinburgh Road, preventing the public from using the Edinburgh Public Dock. The Japanese authorities took this step without the permission of the Public Council. As for the Japanese newspaper report that Japanese shipping companies have negotiated with the Municipal Council to purchase the Public Docks, it is inaccurate because the Japanese side has never consulted the Bureau. According to a Japanese newspaper report earlier this week, Japanese merchants had negotiated with the Municipal Council to purchase the Public Docks along Yangshupu Road in order to carry out a plan to merge the most important Japanese commercial docks in Shanghai.

### Secondary Landlord Instigates Japanese Military Police; To Threaten Subtenants; Illegal Action in Hopes of Increasing Rent; Japanese Military Police and Three Chinese People Arrested

The North China Daily News says that on Monday night, the Shanghai Municipal Police Department of the Public Concession detained a Japanese Military Police officer and three Chinese people on Medhurst Road because of threats to tenants in a house on that road who refused to increase rent. The arrested Japanese Military Police officer was handed over to the military police headquarters by the Police Department. The three Chinese people were tried in the Special No. 1 Court yesterday and adjourned for 15 days. The incident was due to a secondary landlord of a house on Medhurst Road in the US military housing area deciding to increase the rent. The three subtenants refused to pay the rent. On July 8th, the secondary landlord actually instigated a sergeant of the Japanese Military Police team to go with four Chinese people to warn the three subtenants, saying that if they did not pay the rent, they would encounter trouble, and then left. The matter was still unresolved. On Monday night, the military police officer returned to the house with the three Chinese people to threaten the three subtenants. The Sinza Police Station received a report and sent officers to arrest the Japanese Military Police officer and the Chinese people. The Japanese Military Police officer was handed over to the Japanese authorities, and the three arrested Chinese people were prosecuted in the Special No. 1 Court.

### Post Office Refuses to Accept Hemp Cloth-Wrapped Packages

Yesterday, the parcel post section of the post office posted a notice stating, "For notification purposes, it has been found that recently, there have been packages wrapped in hemp cloth submitted to this section for mailing. This hemp cloth is exceptionally rough, making it difficult to affix small labels and causing the handwriting to be blurry and difficult to recognize. To avoid these difficulties, it is requested that all senders henceforth sew a large piece of white cloth onto each of these packages, clearly stating the recipient's name and address for easy verification. This is to inform you." According to a person in charge of the section yesterday, any such packages submitted for mailing in the future will be refused.

Suspension of Mail to Certain Locations

A newspaper reporter learned from the Parcel Business Division of the Postal Administration yesterday that due to transportation difficulties, parcel post services have been suspended to the following locations: Chongqing, Chengdu, Kunming, Guizhou, Zhenhai, Yin County, the southern part of Zhejiang Province, along the Zhe-Gan Railway, the southern part of Anhui Province, Jiangxi Province, Yongjia (Wenzhou), Rui'an, Gutoutou, Pingyang, Nanchang, and all areas south of it, Yichang, Changsha, Wanxian, Luzhou, Xufu, and all other locations. The postal administration has notified that it will temporarily suspend the acceptance of all large and small parcels, as well as individual parcels, to these locations. Mail services will resume as usual once shipping is restored to facilitate the flow of goods.

Occupied Areas

The areas where parcel post services are still operating as usual include: all locations along the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, such as Nanjing, Shanghai, Zhenjiang, Wuxi, etc.; all ports along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, such as Hangzhou, Jiaxing, etc.; all areas north of the Yangtze River via Zhenjiang; along the Tianjin-Pukou Railway; Nantong, Qingdao, Dalian, Xiamen, Yantai, Tianjin, Beijing, Shandong, and other locations. Parcel post services to these areas are currently maintained in their original state. However, if transportation to these areas is disrupted, a notice of suspension will be issued immediately, and the delivery time will be quite long.

### Psychological Hygiene Promotion Association (Part 2)

— Water Foam

The committee members and staff of the Shanghai Psychological Hygiene Promotion Association are:

President: Dr. H.C. Westbrook (Professor, University of Shanghai)

Vice President: Huang Jiayin (Editor, West Wind)

Secretary: Dr. A.W. Sheriff (Professor, St. John's University)

Medical Advisor: Dr. F.G. Halpern (Professor of Neurology, St. John's University Medical School)

Dr. C.A. Cater (Doctor, Renji Hospital)

Committee Members: Ding Guangxun (Student Secretary, YMCA)

Li Zhu (Children's Welfare Section, Public Works Department)

Zeng Jingchen (Doctor, Hongqiao Sanatorium)

The Shanghai Psychological Hygiene Promotion Association is now cooperating with the World Red Cross to establish a neuropsychiatric hospital. To practice the spirit of serving society and from an academic research perspective, the hospital will use new and reasonable therapies not only to treat mental illness but also to improve the conditions of care and to pay attention to the mental health of patients after discharge.

The address of the Neuropsychiatric Hospital is 271 Yuyuan Road, located in a quiet environment. In the backyard, there is a green lawn, prepared as a sports ground for patients with mild mental illness. The courtyard is surrounded by evergreen trees, including parasol trees, banana trees, and flowers of various colors, red and blue, which add to the tranquil atmosphere of the hospital. The wards and dining rooms are all painted green. Patients who are nervous or manic can experience a calming and soothing effect from the harmonious and elegant colors. Furthermore, it feels comfortable and peaceful, as if one were at home rather than in a hospital.

The Neuropsychiatric Hospital is a three-story Western-style building. In front of the building on the ground floor is a corridor with reclining chairs for patients to rest. There is also a reception room, a dining room, a laboratory, a dispensing room, and the Children's Psychological Guidance Center established by the Shanghai Psychological Hygiene Promotion Association.

The windows in each room of the hospital are fitted with wire mesh to prevent unfortunate incidents involving patients. In the second-class wards, nurses are on duty day and night. In the first-class rooms, there are peepholes in the doors so that nurses can observe the patients' movements at all times without disturbing their peace. All equipment, such as rubber suits and tents, are the latest models, to prevent severe, delusional patients from becoming violent.

This hospital, which aims to improve the treatment of mentally ill patients, opened on June 9 of this year. However, it had already begun admitting patients in May. Currently, there are more than sixty patients in the entire hospital, with foreign patients accounting for one-third.

The director of the hospital is Dr. F.G. Halpern, Professor of Psychiatry at St. John's University Medical School in Shanghai, and also Chairman of the Specialist Talent Committee of the Shanghai Psychological Hygiene Promotion Association. Dr. Halpern is a well-known psychiatrist in Shanghai. The medical director of the hospital is Dr. Li Bangzheng.

In terms of treatment methods, in addition to medication, there is also psychotherapy, which includes methods such as hypnosis, psychoanalysis, and occupational therapy. The results of the implementation have been found to be very effective. Although the history of the hospital is short, three patients have already recovered their mental health and have been discharged happily.

The responsible personnel of the Shanghai Psychological Hygiene Promotion Association are doing this meaningful and valuable social work, enabling people to create a good and appropriate psychological state, to educate and train them to overcome difficulties in their circumstances, and to lead a normal mental life. At the same time, they are guiding travelers lost in the dark, abnormal mental world, helping them regain their compass and reach a bright destination following the radiant light.

### Lawsuit Involving Good Friends Over a Thousand-Yuan Loan for Three Years; Seven Trials (or Twelve) Have Not Resolved It; The Court Advises Reconciliation to Avoid Spiritual and Material Losses

Hu Yunfei, a shareholder of the Datong Machinery Factory on Avenue Joffre in the French Concession, and Shen Hefang, a native of Ningbo, were originally good friends. In 1938, Hu borrowed 1,000 yuan from Shen, but failed to repay it on time. Fearing that Shen would sue him according to the law, Hu preemptively filed a lawsuit against Shen in the First Special District Court, claiming that Shen owed him a loan of 1,200 yuan. During the litigation, Shen presented the IOU and letters issued by Hu, proving that Hu had indeed borrowed money from him, and that Hu's accusation was

completely fabricated.

However, Hu claimed that the evidence presented by Shen was suspected of being forged. At the same time, he also filed a criminal lawsuit against Shen for forgery. Both the civil and criminal lawsuits were heard in three trials, and Shen won completely. The cases have been finalized. During the execution process, Shen believed that Hu not only failed to repay the loan but also repeatedly engaged in litigation, even maliciously filing civil and criminal lawsuits with false accusations. Feeling that it was difficult to calm his anger, he filed a lawsuit against Hu for false accusation. Although the first instance declared him not guilty, Shen still appealed to the Second Branch of the High Court. Unexpectedly, Hu suddenly hired lawyer Yang Sicheng and filed a lawsuit against Shen Hefang in the criminal court of the First Special Court, accusing him of

forgery.

The facts he presented alleged that Shen had replaced the evidence presented in the case, causing the plaintiff to lose the case. Judge Liu Yukui opened a court hearing yesterday to try the case. The defendant, Shen Hefang, hired lawyers Shan Yuhua and Zhou Zhengli to appear in court. They found the plaintiff's accusation to be strange because the evidence was stored in the court's files. How could the defendant have the ability to secretly replace it? As for the plaintiff's character, the court should be well aware of it because the plaintiff was previously sentenced by the court in the Shanghai Paper Mill forgery case to

one year in prison

and is currently still on probation. However, Hu Yunfei accused lawyer Shan in court of using various shady tactics. Lawyer Shan immediately requested that the court record this statement in the minutes and said that the plaintiff himself had engaged in major shady activities during the civil lawsuit, and that his lawyer had evidence to prove it. Judge Liu immediately ordered them to stop arguing and declared that since both parties were originally good friends, they have been in litigation for three years over a small amount of over 1,000 yuan. The case has gone through

seven trials

and still cannot be resolved. In the future, even if there are twenty trials, it will be difficult to resolve. The mental suffering is not to mention, and the financial losses far exceed the original amount in dispute. Therefore, the court hopes that both parties can calm down and thoroughly reconcile from the root, so that the litigation can be stopped, the friendship can be restored, and the mental and material damage can be minimized. Shen Hefang expressed his willingness to accept the court's goodwill, but said that he did not want to be involved in litigation in the first place, and that it was the plaintiff who was fond of litigation. After the court reviewed the evidence, it announced that the case would be adjourned and that the plaintiff and defendant would be asked to try to reconcile outside the court.

### Gold Bars Robbed; Losses Reach 150,000 Yuan

At 7:30 AM yesterday (the 17th), four robbers broke into the home of economist Wang Zhiren (from Shandong) at No. 5 Hengmao Lane, Mintini Road. Three of them were armed with handguns. According to the victim, the thugs threatened him with weapons and robbed him of 28 gold bars hidden in his pillow, as well as a gold bracelet and four gold rings worn by his wife, worth a total of about 150,000 yuan. At the time, only the victim, his wife, and their two children were present. The thugs spoke with a northern accent. After entering the house, they went straight to the bed where the gold bars were hidden and robbed them without searching anywhere else. After obtaining the stolen goods, they fled without firing a shot. The victim reported the incident to the police an hour later.

### Chinese Constable's Handgun Robbed

Thugs Escaped in a Car According to the North China Daily News, at 9:00 PM last night (the 16th), Chinese constable No. 2263 was on duty at Yaoshui Lane on Xiaoshadu Road when four armed thugs suddenly arrived and robbed the constable of his handgun and police whistle. One of the thugs first tied up the Chinese constable's right hand, and another thug then snatched the handgun from his holster. They waited there for a while and then drove away in a car. At the time, the constable saw the license plate number of the car the thugs were in, but it is believed that the number was forged by the thugs to conceal their identity.

### French Tram Company's Mechanical Staff Demanding Improved Treatment; Not Resolved as of Midnight Last Night

More than 700 workers in the Mechanical Department of the French Tram Company, due to demands for improved treatment, sent many representatives to visit the company's manager at 3:00 PM yesterday, stating the difficulties of their lives and requesting the company to increase wages to maintain their livelihoods. They did not get what they wanted at the time and left disgruntled. They sent representatives again at 5:30 PM for a second request, which was also not accepted.

As a result, the workers in the department were indignant and gathered at the company until 8:30 PM without dispersing. The company authorities, fearing an accident, reported to the Lujiawan General Police Station and dispatched two armored vehicles and all the detectives to the company to suppress the situation and persuade them with kind words.

They then dispersed. However, the ticket sellers and drivers in the Traffic Department were not affected. If the company does not have a concrete plan this morning, it is difficult to predict whether the Traffic Department's workers will be drawn into the vortex and whether there will be problems with the operation of the vehicles.

### French Authorities Award Medals to Meritorious Chinese Constables

The French Police Department decided on the 13th of this month to award a bronze medal to Chinese constable No. 790.

### Guangdong Children's Education Institute Launches Sponsorship of Orphaned Children Movement; Sponsorship of One Child Costs 14 Yuan Per Month

(Shaoguan News) The Guangdong Children's Education Institute plans to launch a movement to sponsor orphaned children. People from home and abroad can decide the amount of sponsorship according to their financial ability, but the sponsorship of one child should be male in principle, the sponsorship of two children should be one male and one female in principle, the sponsorship of four children should be two males and two females in principle, and so on. The sponsorship of one orphaned child should be responsible for providing 14 yuan of national currency per month for their living expenses, and so on for more. The burden of living expenses will start from the date of sponsorship until the end of the war, when the children are sent back to their original relatives or can be self-sufficient. The institute has formulated a sponsorship form. After deciding on the number of sponsorships, two copies of the first type of form should be filled out according to the regulations, one copy for self-retention and one copy sent to the institute to select the sponsored children. Then, two copies of the second type of form should be filled out according to the regulations, one copy for retention by the institute and one copy sent to the sponsor as proof. It is generally stipulated that the sponsorship fee for half a year (the minimum limit is half a year) should be sent to the institute first, so that the sponsored orphaned children can have a close relationship with the sponsor and communicate frequently, and can be treated as children. If the sponsored orphaned child unfortunately dies or is taken back by their original parents, another sponsorship can be arranged. Also, after the children are sent back to their original parents, with the consent of the child's parents, the sponsor can directly establish a relationship with them. If, due to changes in economic circumstances, they cannot afford the living expenses of the orphaned children, other enthusiastic people must be found to sponsor them in their place, so as to avoid the sponsored children from experiencing a panic in their lives. If the sponsorship rights are transferred to others, the institute should be notified immediately. The institute plans to reward people from home and abroad who sponsor orphaned children. Those who sponsor 10 to 20 orphaned children will be given a banner by the president as a souvenir. Those who sponsor more than 20 children will be invited to have Chairman Li of the Provincial Government inscribe a horizontal plaque or banner as a souvenir. The names of all overseas Chinese sponsors and the number of sponsorships will be published in provincial newspapers and various publications of the institute.

The morning opened at $5,230, which was already $30 better than the previous day. Then, securities firms and money changers jointly drove the price up to $5,280.

### Atmosphere of Peace Dissipated; Foreign Exchange Hedged

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no changes in HSBC's listed prices.

The morning initially saw a gradual tightening trend, as speculators made some purchases. Later, because Hong Kong Electric and the Japanese Bank sold, the price hardened slightly. However, until the close, both Chinese banks and American banks had an appetite, although the amounts were extremely small, and the underlying trend was still tight.

Korean notes saw a decrease in demand, and the evening price continued to rise to 1 yuan 02 cents.

### British and Indian Silver Prices Both Rose

London, 16th Telegram: The London silver market saw the near term rise by 125 and the far term flat. There were buyers covering positions, and the supply was not large. The market was flat and there was little trading. The market remained stable after the close. New York Telegram: The US silver spot price was unchanged. Bombay Telegram: Both Indian silver spot and futures rose by two annas. A total of 100 contracts were traded, and the market was quite flat.

### Discount Rate Rebounded by Two Yuan

Yesterday's exchange transfer bill discount rate suddenly rebounded. The morning discount rate reached 52 yuan per thousand yuan, and the discount rate also rose to 50 yuan. In the afternoon, it was still around 51 yuan, which was two yuan higher than the previous day. The interbank lending rate of the Money Industry Association continued to fall by one cent to 18 cents.

### Rice Prices Rebounded by Two or Three Yuan Yesterday; Another 3,000 Tons of Imported Rice Arrived

After the rice market fell sharply again the day before, it immediately aroused the interest of buyers at noon. Yesterday morning, both buyers and sellers maintained the momentum of the previous day's noon market, and their intentions became firm. The buying momentum suddenly became strong. Not only was local sales smooth, but also inland village customers who had not dared to enter the market rashly had increased their demand after stopping for many days. At the same time, general buyers had been bored for a long time and suddenly found themselves in a good situation, feeling doubly excited. Shouts rose suddenly, and by nearly noon, prices had rebounded by a huge two or three yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. For example, No. 1 Chen Saigon opened at 56 yuan and a half, No. 2 at 53 yuan and a half, No. 1 Siam at 56 yuan, No. 2 at 53 yuan and a half, Fire Grind at 55 yuan and 7 cents, Small Grain at 54 yuan and a half, Tokyo Pointed Tip at 50 yuan and 3 cents, Broken Tip at 42 yuan and 8 cents, and then to 40 yuan, Rice Green at 445 yuan. The owner of the cargo loaded on the 20th of last month initially opened at 61 yuan and a half and immediately shouted 2 yuan higher without further agreement, while the cargo loaded on the 26th opened at 63 yuan and even rose from 63 yuan and 5 cents to 63 yuan and a half, which was 2 yuan and 9 cents higher than the previous day. The market was lively with grabbing and covering shorts, so spot transactions exceeded 10,000 bags. However, with the arrival of more stocks, actual sales were still slow. Yesterday's rebound was also a sign of a small rebound after a big fall, and there is no expectation of a sudden sharp rebound in the future market.

Another 3,000 tons of imported rice arrived yesterday, estimated to be more than 30,400 bags, shipped from Hong Kong by the Java Company's Cibadak vessel. The vessel arrived at the port at 9:00 AM yesterday and docked at the Pudong Blue Funnel Wharf for unloading. (Zu)

In this environment, general cargo owners also want to make a profit with glutinous rice, but it is difficult to achieve their wish because the price is already expensive. The price is neither rising nor falling, and only the market shape seems to be tighter. Jin Li Baiyuan is still only around 63 yuan, and Chang Dan Baiyuan is sold for 61 yuan. However, Hong Kong glutinous rice followed the rise of imported rice and opened at 645 yuan.

More than 1,000 bags of thick and thin japonica and other domestic rice arrived yesterday. It is rumored that outside the market, those who hold goods saw the rise in imported rice and tried to shout higher, but the price difference between domestic and imported rice was still too large. Buyers' appetite was normal, and the opening price failed to increase, which was still similar to the previous market.

### Abundant Wheat Stocks in Hongkou; Difficult to Sell Unless at Low Prices; Chinese Factories Cannot Obtain It

The flour market has no special characteristics, but the local sales of Chinese factory flour are gradually increasing. This is because the factory's supply has become widespread, and the price of rice has also fallen and risen slightly. Therefore, the flour shops in this street have a more greedy appetite, and the total number of packages directly approved by the Fufu factories is no less than 10,000. The factory price is still 16 yuan, and the retail price is about 3 cents higher per package. The old car brand warehouse receipt still requires a price of 17 yuan, but there is no proper delivery. Japanese factory flour competes with inland flour, and the market is loosening again. It is heard that Jinshan brand opened at 16 yuan and 3 cents, and Phoenix opened at 15 yuan and 1 cent in August, both of which are one or two cents lower. A total of 4,500 packages were traded.

The wheat market continues to be uneventful, because both Japanese and Chinese factories do not make large purchases. The new arrivals in Hongkou are accumulating, and they are suppressed by Japanese factories, which only purchase at low prices, so the transactions are very quiet. Chinese factories have difficulty purchasing and have to pay attention to imported wheat. It is heard that Fufeng Factory ordered a ship of Australian wheat and intends to continue to order. It is currently in telecommunications negotiations.

### Miscellaneous Grains: Minor Transactions; Prices Mostly Downstream

The market conditions for miscellaneous grains have been poor, and people have little interest, resulting in minor transactions and prices mostly downstream. Yesterday, a total of 500 bags of Anqing soybeans were traded at a price of 28 yuan and 2 cents to 28 yuan. 200 bags of Qingdao soybeans were traded at a price of 29 yuan. 100 bags of Pudong broad beans were traded at a price of 27 yuan and 7 cents. 50 bags of Jiading white-skinned broad beans were traded at a price of 22 yuan. 400 bags of Wuhu small-grain white-skinned broad beans were traded at a price of 18 yuan and 3 cents to 18 yuan. 150 bags of Beigang green-skinned broad beans were traded at a price of 21 yuan and 7 cents to 21 yuan. 150 bags of Chongming green-skinned broad beans were traded at a price of 20 yuan to 19 yuan and 5 cents. More than 100 bags of Pudong green-skinned broad beans were traded at a price of 20 yuan and 2 cents and 5 cents, and more than 100 bags of Wuhu corn were traded at a price of 21 yuan and 5 cents. The above-mentioned goods, except for Chongming broad beans, which were handled by Guangdong merchants, were all sold in this street.

There are 1,300 bags of beans going to Hong Kong today. 1,450 cans of raw oil came from Qingdao yesterday.

### Securities: Domestic Bonds Fluctuate Suddenly; Foreign Stocks Lack Strength

Yesterday's black market conditions for unified public bonds were erratic, and the trend was complex and abnormal. When it opened in the morning, the rumored peace rumors were corrected in the newspaper, so everyone fled, and speculators took the opportunity to monopolize, leaning left and right, so the market was rising and falling suddenly, with a downward trend. By the afternoon, the market situation suddenly returned to normal. A powerful long family, although feeling that the rumors could not be followed by strong confirmation, had the delusion that there was no trace of evidence, and because the ninth phase was about to pay interest, it made buyers excited, so many rushed to absorb, so there was a phenomenon of selling to buy on the market, and the market immediately rose, especially Bingjia. As a result, the overall trend was slightly soft. It is estimated that Wuxiao fell 25 cents, Bingyi fell by about one cent, and Dingjia was unchanged. The transaction was even more prosperous, reaching a scale of 1.78 million yuan.

Yesterday's stock market saw 20 shares of China Bank traded at a price of 12 yuan per share.

The stock market news of various industries is still uncertain, but the trend is still firm. Because there are many sellers when the price rises, it is not easy to raise the market price very high. The transaction volume is less than in the previous few days, and there are more people interested in rubber stocks.

London, 16th (Tuesday) Telegram: Today's listed prices of Chinese foreign debts are generally flat. Only the Anglo-German continued loan British bond notes fell by 5 pounds, priced at 35 pounds, and the rest remained unchanged.

Anglo-German Continued (British)

35.00 Down 5.00

London, 16th (Tuesday) Telegram: Today's listed prices of Far East British companies' stocks saw a slight rebound in bank stocks. Jardine Matheson Bank shares rose by 2 shillings and 6 pence, priced at 6 pounds. HSBC Bank shares rose by 2 pounds each, with British-registered shares at 65 pounds and Hong Kong-registered shares at 67 pounds. Golak Limerick Pound rubber shares alone fell by 7 and a half pence, priced at 14 shillings and 4 and a half pence, and the rest remained unchanged.

### Yarn and Cotton: Longs Attempt to Rebound Cotton Yarn Prices; Double Horse Yarn Up 26 Yuan from Previous Day

The yarn market fell miserably the day before, but today it has improved slightly. This is because the decline the day before was too severe, and the peace rumors are still unsubstantiated, so people are calm, and longs are stable. At the same time, the gold market has rebounded again, so speculators have slightly purchased a few packages to maintain the market. However, the sales of existing yarn are very scarce, and the changes in the future are difficult to predict.

Existing yarn opened this morning. Because the atmosphere of war and peace dissipated, people turned their minds, and new sellers were scarcer. The long side slightly absorbed a few packages. The opening price of 20s Double Horse was 920 yuan, falling to 905 yuan, but actual transactions were still rare. However, the market was tight because the selling sentiment was not timid. The scalpers sold the chips at the opening, and after 11:00 AM, the foreign exchange had no major changes, so they made up for their positions, and the market gradually rose, forming an inverse proportion to the previous day. The highest price at the close was 941 yuan. The statistics of transactions in half a day totaled 1,360 packages. The price of 20s Double Horse rose by 26 yuan. A total of 600 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong today. The amount purchased by each gang is listed as follows:

Same Industry 1,250 Inland 10

Hong Kong 100 Total 1,360

### Indian Cotton Fixed Prices Increased; Chinese Factories Move to Handle Spot Cotton

Spot cotton transactions are slightly more active because Indian cotton fixed prices have increased compared to before, so people are calm, and Chinese factories have slightly higher demand. The spot cotton situation is as follows:

Da Zhong Ji 213.00 New Yu Jin 100 Pieces

Also 213.00 Also 500 Packages

Special Tonghua 183.00 Also 500 Packages

Ningbo Hua 160.00 Chongxin Jin 8,000 Dan

In addition, the foreign cotton market price, the New York cotton market, initially fell slightly due to speculators selling, and then rebounded due to poor weather in the cotton area and public purchases. As a result, the closing price, in addition to the recent continued fall of 14 pounds sound, the far term rose by 78 pounds sound. The Indian market is firm, and yesterday, including the forecast, it rose by more than two rupees.

In the Shanghai foreign cotton market, yarn prices rebounded yesterday, and people's minds improved. Factories are quite willing to purchase, but due to the high prices demanded by the industry, there were no transactions. But according to today's situation, the foundation of cotton is very good.

### Silk and Tea: Shrimp Eye Pearl Tea Sold Slightly

The tea market in foreign firms yesterday was still flat. Although the German firms were still active in coarse black tea, the stocks were lacking, and the supply could not meet the demand. The green tea stocks, including raw tea, were no less than 8,000 bundles, and there were also 3,000 boxes of boxed tea. Because of the limited shipping routes for French firms, the market was difficult to improve. The current market is only selling a small amount of colorless shrimp eye pearl tea of the Ping Shui type by American firms. The entire city purchased more than 80 boxes of pearl tea from Tongfu Jinlong and other firms, with a selling price of 250 yuan to 290 yuan, which was more than 10 yuan lower than before.

Also, 600 pieces of tea were shipped to Tianjin today.

### North-South Goods: Lychees Arrived Late; Xin Hao Lychees Cannot Be Shipped; Haikou Lychee Sources Also Blocked

According to a letter from a customer, the ten types of lychees produced in Zhangzhou, such as Lanting, Wuye, and Zaohong, have indeed entered the market, but the sailing ship transportation between Zhangzhou and Gulangyu has recently been stagnant, so they cannot be shipped. They must wait for the resumption of shipping before they can be loaded, so the arrival date in Shanghai is yet to be determined.

A total of more than 3,000 boxes of new Haikou lychees have arrived. Originally, sales were not very smooth, but the other day, there was news that the Zhejiang-Fujian Haikou was blocked, so the Yong Ou route was completely blocked. To avoid the accumulation of inventory, the firm has telegraphed the cargo owner to stop loading.

### Sugar Market: Crude White Sugar Market Firm Later

The sugar market was weak at first and then firm yesterday, resulting in a slight increase. The association's plan, the spot price of 24 crude white foreign warehouse goods, was initially 66 yuan and 3 cents, and later rose to 66 yuan and 6 cents, up by one cent, and the transshipment goods were stronger, with the first price once reaching 53 yuan, and later 52 yuan and 7 cents to 5 cents, which was half a yuan better than before. Taiche white sugar also initially fell and then rose, with the B Mark at 75 yuan and 6 cents to 8 cents, and then still at 76 yuan, with no increase or decrease. Dutch red sugar was 58 yuan, up 3 cents, and the local warehouse was 58 yuan and a half. A Guangdong merchant sold dozens of packages of Haikou foreign sugar, priced at 68 yuan and 2 cents, which was higher than before.

Also, 1,600 tons of sugar came from Holland yesterday.

### Coal and Coal Ball Factory Prices Reduced by Another 1 Yuan and 20 Cents per Load

Since the uniform factory price for coal balls was set the other day, the business has been sluggish due to the hot weather, and the exchange rate has loosened, reducing costs. The day before yesterday, the industry firms reduced the price by another 6 yuan, so the price of Yitai Xing, Nanyang, and Guohua coal balls is 132 yuan per ton by car and 134 yuan delivered, and the retail price per load is 7 yuan and 20 cents.

### Medicinal Materials: Zhaozhi Goods Tightened Due to Shortage

Zhaozhi goods were once reduced by four or five yuan due to poor sales, but the source has long since stopped. The inventory in the market is gradually decreasing except for retail sales, and the scheduled goods are also about to be delivered, so the trend has tightened again, and the current price of scheduled goods has been increased by five yuan.

### Miscellaneous: 700 Tons of White Wax Imported

700 tons of white wax were imported on the 17th from the Netherlands. Also, 1,645 cans of tung oil came from Tianjin, and 647 packages of alkali came from Qingdao.

Encouraging Burial (2)

According to ancient etiquette, scholars and commoners should be buried within a month of death. Before the burial, they should not change their clothes, eat porridge, live in a thatched hut, and mourn the fact that their loved ones have not yet been returned to the earth. According to the laws and regulations of the Qing Dynasty, anyone with a family in mourning who is confused by feng shui or delays the burial of the coffin at home for years under false pretenses shall be punished with eighty strokes of the cane. In addition, according to the regulations of the 37th year of Qianlong, if the coffin has not been buried, one year shall be the limit. In addition to those who have the ability and land to be buried, they shall be urged to bury them according to etiquette. Or if they cannot obtain land for a time, they shall be allowed to rent land outside the city for temporary placement and still be ordered to find land for burial as soon as possible, without causing long-term placement in shallow soil. Those who have coffins that have been stored at home for many years shall be punished according to the law. It can be seen that overdue burial is prohibited by law. If one borrows the remains of one's ancestors to predict the success of one's descendants, is it that geography has authority, but heaven has no authority? And also think about the hard work of the ancestors in starting and building the family. Now that the decaying bones have been cold, obtaining a piece of land is the best. If the dead have knowledge, they will count their sins and strip their souls. How can they make us prosperous in descendants and wealth, and bless our achievements? I wish those in the world who delay burial to quickly seek burial in the soil for peace. The good or bad luck depends on heaven. In short: burial is to store bones, and the burial site does not have to be beautiful; burial is to appease the soul, and the burial objects do not have to be abundant. Whether it is buried after seven days, or after a hundred days, or after a year, do not leave the coffin for a long time, do not delay in choosing a site, so that parents can get a day of peace sooner, which is to leave a day of blessing for the children.

### The Relationship Between Jesus and Humanity

"When Jesus saw the crowds, he had compassion on them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd." This is recorded in Matthew 9:36 of the Christian New Testament. From these words, we know that Jesus' compassion for the world was because people were "harassed," "helpless," and "like sheep without a shepherd." These are indeed three common ailments of humanity, past and present. Let us discuss them separately:

(1) The accurate interpretation of the original text of the words "harassed" is: "Wandering aimlessly, resulting in fatigue and exhaustion." If a person spends his life wandering around like strolling on the street, through bustling main roads and quiet back alleys, without any purpose, wasting his life, it is an extremely sad thing. At that time, Jesus saw that most people were suffering from such a problem, constantly changing their minds and having no definite purpose, leaving them exhausted and even developing a pessimistic attitude towards life, devoid of any joy. It was truly pitiful.

(2) The original meaning of the words "helpless" is: scattering in all directions. This is also a major ailment of humanity. People cannot connect with each other, cannot express sympathy, and cannot cooperate. They go their separate ways and have different dreams while sharing the same bed. Some say, "Because people have different lives and different thoughts, it is difficult to unite as one." But the Christian Bible tells us that humans are born of the same root (Acts 17:26) and should be connected to each other, as close as siblings. If we can do this, then weapons of war can be turned into instruments of peace.

(3) "Like sheep without a shepherd" refers to Jesus' compassion for the people of that time, who lacked a proper leader and were led by the blind. This was the case in Jesus' time, and is it not the same now? Although all countries have their leaders, such as Hitler in Germany, Churchill in England, Roosevelt in the United States, and Mussolini in Italy, these people have all made contributions to their own countries. But who is worthy to be the leader of the world? Napoleon of France could be considered a "hero of the age," but even he sighed in admiration of Jesus' greatness. Jesus is indeed the true leader of humanity, and only he can save us from hardship and wandering.

Brief Talk

### Between Two Generations

— Editor

The gap between parents and children, the two generations, is at most only twenty-odd years. In the past, the progress of the times was like an old ox pulling a broken cart, and twenty-odd years didn't amount to much. But today, the rapid advances in science and thought have made these twenty-odd years an insurmountable chasm, separating parents and children and creating two opposing centuries of people.

Thus, serious conflicts arise between the two generations. Parents say their children are unfilial and don't understand the rules. Children complain that their parents are out of touch and have outdated ideas. Fierce, invisible struggles occur within the family. Weak children endure life under the pressure of their parents' economic power, suppressing their anger. Stubborn children rise up to resist, and when there is no other option, a family tragedy unfolds.

Can this conflict between the new and the old, this tragedy of family breakdown, be avoided? Is there an end to the conflict and struggle between father and son, mother and daughter?

The clash of new and old ideas is a necessary phenomenon in the process of social evolution. The times are always moving forward, and promising young people will naturally follow the trend of the times. If parents can keep up with the thinking of the times and understand the psychology of their children, then this tragedy of going against the current can be reduced or eliminated.

### I Bless My Younger Brother

— Wu Wangchuan

I have a younger brother, a brother I am proud to show to anyone. I myself believe that if I lost this younger brother, I would be lost forever. I can't be sure what should be done and what shouldn't. My brother often watches over me, instructs me, and even scolds me. I have never resisted or disobeyed his corrections and punishments, because what he says is often right, and it doesn't sound like something a child would say. I have no reason not to listen to him. As a result, my father often says I'm useless, and I myself feel useless.

My brother is thirteen years old this year, and he has a heart that seeks truth and light. He has asked me several times, "Why don't you go to the Southwest?" I always reply, "My body is too weak, I'll definitely get sick and die if I go." Then he makes a face at me.

Once, my fourth aunt came to Shanghai from my hometown, and my mother wanted me to accompany her to see a movie. I happily put on my clothes. Just as I was about to go downstairs, my brother came back from school and asked me where I was going. My mother replied that we were going to see a movie and told him to come along too. My brother glanced at me, put his schoolbag on the desk, looked at the opposite wall, and said to me in a serious voice, "Brother, have you forgotten our agreement?"

Indeed, I remembered that there was such a clause in our nine-article agreement: "From the date of this agreement until the victory of the war of resistance, we shall not watch movies or dramas, except for those of great significance." So I put down my hat, leaned back in my chair, lowered my head, and repented deeply. My mother was still urging me to hurry up in the next room, but I didn't answer.

My brother walked up to me and said softly, "Brother, I'm sorry, I didn't know you were accompanying my aunt. Don't you remember that the agreement says except for plays with significance?" I burst into tears, I hugged him tightly, I told him that I really had no intention of seeing a movie with significance. This made me even more ashamed and remorseful. My brother whispered in my ear, "Just don't go." I really felt that this was too easy on me, too indulgent of me.

Yesterday was my brother's birthday, and my aunt gave him a Parker fountain pen. My brother was very happy to receive it. He asked my mother for a piece of velvet cloth and carefully wiped it over and over. I watched coldly from the side, thinking to myself, today I should say, "This pen must be foreign!" This immediately took effect, and the smile on his face disappeared. He stared blankly at the pen, and I knew that this had hurt his heart. I shouldn't have harbored a retaliatory intention to hurt him. I felt so small, I regretted that I had said it.

My brother handed the pen to my mother and said, "Please keep it for me until I grow up."

In short, my younger brother is so respectable and lovable. He invisibly gives me a lot of courage and comfort, showing me a bright future. Many relatives and friends say that my brother doesn't seem like a child, and when I hear that, I secretly bless him all the time.

### Not Afraid of Setbacks

— Ou Li

The reason why a person becomes a great man is often not without reason.

It is said that the Irish are most unafraid of setbacks and failures, and the Irish Prime Minister Éamon de Valera is the best example.

One day in 1923, de Valera was giving a political speech in Ennis when he was suddenly arrested and imprisoned for a year.

A year later, when he was released from prison, he immediately went back to Ennis to continue the speech he had not finished. He said, "When I was interrupted and stopped speaking, I was just saying..."

Look, look at this stubborn spirit of not being afraid of setbacks!

### Revival of the Church

Many people say that to revive a city, you must abolish gambling dens and brothels; but God only asks his people to humble themselves, pray, seek his face, and turn away from their wicked ways, and he will forgive their sins and heal their land.

To revive China, there are three important things:

(1) Prayer The Bible says, "If you knock, the door will be opened to you; if you ask, you will be given; you do not receive, because you do not ask." Once, Dr. Scharpe, of the Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in the United States, was leading a revival meeting in a certain place when a woman said to him, "Doctor, this revival meeting will surely have a great revival." Dr. Scharpe asked her, "How do you know that this time there will be a great revival?" She said, "My family needs revival; my husband is an alcoholic, my son is weak in faith, our church and this place need revival; I believe this revival meeting will have good results, because the people here have prayed a lot for this meeting before it started." Later, 198 people turned to Christ and dedicated themselves to working for the Lord. Dr. Scharpe praised this woman's prayer every time he mentioned the success of this revival meeting.

(2) A life of dedication Once, I met a young man on the bus and asked him, "Are you a Christian?" He said, "I am not a Christian, but I am a Presbyterian." Another time, I met another young man on the train, and I asked him, "Are you a Christian?" He said, "No, I am a Methodist." This shows that many church members are not true Christians. If the church needs revival, there must be true Christians. A year ago, I met a sister who was a nurse and had lived a life of sin. Soon after, she believed in Jesus and confessed Jesus in front of everyone. Last summer, she resolved to travel all over the world to become a fisher of men. She had no strength before, but now she has strength, because she is living a life of dedication.

(3) Earnestness The Lord Jesus wept when he saw Jerusalem, because the people of that city did not believe in him. Today, there are thousands and millions of people in Shanghai who have no hope and live in sin. What do you feel? Were we born into the world only for food and clothing? If we forget to save people's souls for the sake of food and clothing, then that is not right.

Young brothers and sisters, the harvest is ripe. Every day, how many lost people are sinking into hell because we do not care about their souls. We must hurry to take on the responsibility of saving people. For details, please write to Post Office Box 1581.

Hawthorne's Detective Cases

### The Fate of the Dance Queen

— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter Three: Conflicting Information

"Yes, he is the son of Master Li and also the cousin of Miss Wang. He came from Suzhou for lunch on the seventeenth the day before yesterday, stayed overnight, and went back early yesterday morning. Master Li personally took him to the train."

Hawthorne paused and nodded. "Okay, tell me, what happened when Miss Wang and her cousin were talking here?"

Old Mao said, "That man surnamed Zhao suddenly came. Miss Wang saw him from the window and quickly left this reception room to prevent Zhao Boxiong from entering. Then she closed the front door and pulled the curtains here, clearly not letting Zhao see anything. Zhao, finding this boring, stood at the door for a while before walking away with a sullen face."

I thought to myself, "Alas! Three weren't enough, and now another one is added! This woman's charming magic during her lifetime is truly terrifying!"

The room was silent for only a second or two before Old Mao automatically opened his mouth again.

"Sir, don't misunderstand. No matter what, that man surnamed Zhao would never have killed Miss Wang. It must have been Yu Gantang..."

Hawthorne jumped up for the second time, and this time his movements were even faster than before. He ran to the door and, with lightning-like speed, pulled it open with one hand. Standing stiffly outside the door was the maid, Jinmei.

Hawthorne said loudly, "Jinmei, what are you doing?"

Jinmei's face was pale, and her lips were trembling slightly. Her previous calm demeanor had completely disappeared.

She said stammeringly, "I...I came to report..."

"Report what?"

"I know the murderer must be Zhao Boxiong, definitely not Young Master Yu."

"How do you know?"

"Because Miss Wang lost so many jewelry, it must be... someone wanted her money. This must be murder for money. Young Master Yu is rich, how could he do such a thing...?"

Ni Jinshou had also followed to the door, roaring at her. "Who asked you to express your opinion? You dared to eavesdrop! Go back upstairs!" (48)

Essays

### History

— Lei Xing

Stained with blood, years and events weave together like stagnant history.

Breathing the suffocating air of this era, we yearn for a bright and sunny tomorrow. Seeing through the sword light and bloodshed before us, we look forward to the victorious Far East.

Opening the pages of the book, we become braver: history will never deceive.

No one can erase history, and the death light sought by executioners cannot destroy the existence of iron. The demons of darkness will eventually vanish in the dawn of the morning light. For the former, this is truly an irresolvable sorrow.

History has arranged a "Waterloo" for every "Napoleon," and reality will not neglect it either.

The bloody history and bloody reality have sentenced the end of hegemony. Therefore, people struggling in suffering always have great courage and will never slacken—belief and ideals form a driving whip.

### Mobile Bookstore

— Zhi Hui

The German people's active spirit of seeking knowledge is worthy of our emulation.

In the Saar region, the German front line currently has a mobile bookstore, which travels between various military camps and posts along the Siegfried Line.

When the European War began, libraries were established at troop locations; the books in the libraries were donated by the public and bookstores. However, soldiers still needed fresh spiritual food, so the mobile bookstore was set up.

The store is run by the German Book Industry General Office, which entrusts the Labor Front to organize it, and uses public buses as mobile shops. Bookshelves are set up next to the bus, and small tables are placed in the middle for soldiers to read books and newspapers. The store has about 1,500 books and several copies of the day's newspapers. If there are books that the store does not have, soldiers can pre-order and ask them to bring them next time.

The mobile bookstore employs one driver and two administrators, all of whom are provided with meals by the military kitchen.

### Newspaper Reading Manual

— Fan Xuehui

Children have children's manuals, playwrights have drama manuals, and artists have art manuals.

People who like to read have their own manual. They write down sentences that they cannot remember in it, and when they need to quote them, they can retrieve them immediately.

I think it is also possible to compile a manual for reading newspapers, collecting terms such as politics, economics, military affairs, history, and geography, as well as various revelations, into one volume. However, the compiler must put in a lot of effort and not just make it a nominal thing, then I think many people will need this newspaper reading manual.

### Starting from Competing Stages

— Jun Mei

Competing stages don't seem to be very common in the theater world, but recently, because filmmakers are competing to film so-called folk tales, competing stages have become a special phenomenon in the isolated island film scene today.

In the past, when spring stage plays were performed in rural villages, in order to invite troupes and attract audiences for various reasons, occasionally wonderful dramas with competing stages were also performed. The sponsoring village would use all its social skills to create a luxurious setting, and the theater troupes would also do their best to attract the audience. Thus, the audience who came from the cities and towns to listen to the plays were blessed with a feast for the eyes, ears, and mouth. I remember when I was a child, two neighboring villages, A and B, caused a fight because of competing stages. As a result, the government issued a notice prohibiting it. Later, when the two villages performed spring stage plays, they had to jointly hire a theater troupe to perform at the center of the two villages. At that time, the most famous Jianghu troupe charged only fifty or sixty yuan for a play from morning to night, but this was something that ordinary rural villages did not dare to consider. Since then, because the two villages joined forces, they gradually invited these famous troupes. At that time, the civil and military Xusheng Xiao Longsheng's "War of Wancheng," Xiao Beijing's "Stealing the Zongjuan Scroll," the white-bearded old Sheng Huang'er's "Sweeping Pine Under the Book," and the Huadan Haitanghong's "Yin and Yang River" are still popular today, and they are considered an unexpected harvest from competing stages.

Here, I also remember the collaboration between Tan Xinpei and Wang Xiaonong in "Zhu Lian Zhai." Tan and Wang were both top-notch famous actors in the capital at that time, and their artistic achievements each had their own unique aspects. However, neither of them was willing to humble themselves. In 1915, for some unknown reason, they actually collaborated to perform "Zhu Lian Zhai" in the Dong'an Market at that time. Tan played Li Keyong, and Wang played Cheng Jingsi. The two men's skills were equal, and each showed their strengths. The beauty was difficult to compare, and the audience had a feeling that "this song should only be found in heaven." Although this was not a competing stage, Tan and Wang's different performance styles, once they collaborated, taking the best of each other and covering up their own shortcomings, a perfect combination, wasn't it a new contribution to the theater world?

Therefore, some people believe that today's competing stages in the isolated island film industry can curb crude and shoddy production. There is naturally some truth to this, but if the filmmakers can eliminate their unwillingness to give in to each other and instead seek common cooperation, then it may not be difficult to add a special color to today's isolated island film scene!

When Edward G. Robinson was filming "All Through the Night," he specially ordered his servants to bring his leather sofa from home, ready to lie down and rest. However, he was a step late, and the great director Tay Garnett had already sat down before him. He had no choice but to entertain the guests and couldn't force him to sit down. This armchair was really too comfortable. After Tay Garnett, other actors came to sit, and he had to let them sit with a smile. He stood until his legs were tired and his waist was sore, and he couldn't stop calling out "Injustice." When he got home, he had someone carry it home.

Marlene Dietrich, who has returned to the screen, is the most fond of having fun. Ever since she used a kaleidoscope to have fun with James Stewart while filming "Destry Rides Again," everyone smiles and avoids her when they see her coming. One day, Marlene ran into Miguel Lona on the road and stopped him, saying, "Miguel, I have a puppy that looks just like you, so I named it Miguel." Miguel pondered for a while and said seriously to her, "Um! Miss, thank you for your kindness. At the moment, I have nothing to say. I will discuss it with my lawyer and then talk about it." After he finished speaking, he walked away by himself, which made Marlene very angry.

Dorothy Lamour and Johnny Weissmuller are both foreigners with long hair in the film city. Now, there is one less comrade, because Fox Company wants to invite Dorothy Lamour to star in "Dance and the Devil," and at the same time, there is a condition that she has to cut her hair short. Dorothy Lamour happily set off firecrackers.

The servants of Hollywood stars are not used by you, but you listen to their orders. Take the great director Wesley Ruggles' black cook Tom as an example. One morning, when Wesley was having breakfast, he received Tom's letter of resignation, which read: "Dinner must not be late, no later than seven o'clock. Do not talk to Clark Gable, go visit Joe Louis. If you keep your promise, he will not break his promise. If you return in the middle of the night, come and ask me for food. I am already in dreamland, please be careful."

### Xinhua Newcomer Shangguan Yunzhu's Brief History

— Lingzi

Not long ago, Xinhua Film Company held a public examination to cultivate newcomers. As a result, seven women were admitted, and Shangguan Yunzhu was one of them.

Shangguan Yunzhu is not her real name. Her name is Wei Yajun. Because the executives of Xinhua felt that the actor's name was related to their own hopes, they changed her name to her current name.

In the past, she was an employee of He Zuoming's He's Photography Studio. Because of her personality inclination towards drama, she often engaged in drama activities in her spare time. Not long ago, the Huaguang and Yixing drama troupes successively performed "The Beginning of Man" and "Women's Apartment," and she played the female lead in both plays. Her Mandarin acting skills are quite proficient.

Among the ten folk films of Xinhua, she was originally assigned to play the role of Wang Laohu's sister in "Wang Laohu Grabbing a Bride," and she had already filmed two shots. However, later, Xinhua authorities felt that newcomers should not be rushed to perform during the training period, lest the audience have a superficial impression. Therefore, they specially asked Tong Yuejuan to replace her role, giving her more time to cultivate herself.

Among the newcomers admitted by Xinhua this time, in addition to the seven women, there are also seventeen men, who are currently in training. It is expected that under Xinhua's promotion, they will soon shine brightly on the silver screen.
