### The Important Key to the European War

Germany launched the Western Front war, invading the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg on a large scale. It has only been a week so far, but within a few days, it has taken Luxembourg and the Netherlands and joined forces with Britain and France between France and Belgium. Germany's speed of using troops is indeed undeniable.

Germany's success in this decision-making battle of Holland and Belgium is the same as in the last decisive battle; it adopted an active offensive, while the Allied powers took a defensive position. Tactically, Germany took the lead. Germany invaded the Netherlands with a large army, directly approaching Rotterdam, cutting the Netherlands in two; another army advanced from Liège to Brussels, the capital of Belgium, and then captured Brussels and advanced towards the French border; the left wing broke through Sedan on the Maginot Line to contain the Allied forces; Its main force is still on the right wing. If Germany concentrates its forces on the right wing to attack the Allied forces, and the Allied forces also concentrate their forces to defend tit-for-tat, then the situation in this decisive battle will be the same as in the last decisive battle, becoming a "competition of wings". The expansion of the German right wing must stop at the westernmost Belgian coast. According to a news report from the German Sea Communication Agency, "German troops have approached a certain important French-Belgian artillery position on the opposite shore of Dover in the English Channel. This advance is exactly the same as in 1914," etc. This explanation is of course the truth.

From Germany's launch of the invasion of Holland, Belgium, and Luxembourg to the present, it has been unstoppable. The Allied forces have not been able to curb its edge, and London and Paris have been shocked by it. Recalling the last European war, there was also a similar stage; until the German army approached Paris, it was only after the Battle of the Marne that it was frustrated. Then, when and where will the Allied forces in this decision-making battle stop the German offensive? This is what the world is concerned about! However, history never repeats itself mechanically; this decision-making war is very different from previous years. Analyzing its major points, in the last decision-making Germany had to deal with two-sided operations, with Britain and France in the west and Imperial Russia in the east; in this decision-making Germany only has one-sided operations, and there is no Soviet Union to contain it in the east. This can prevent it from repeating the mistakes of the last decision-making and concentrate its forces to implement its combat plans. At the beginning of the last World War, Germany had 100 divisions on the Western Front, while Britain and France only had 72 divisions. In terms of military strength, they had an absolute advantage; after the Eastern Front became urgent, up to 20 divisions were transferred away. Therefore, Germany had only 80 divisions on the Western Front, while the Allied forces, as a result of successive increases, had reached 95 divisions on the eve of the Battle of the Marne, gradually surpassing Germany; therefore, the First Army under the command of the German Kluck, originally pursued the British army southwest from Mons and headed for Paris, suddenly changed its plan and proceeded to the southeast, and its right wing became the target of attack by the British and French forces; in addition, the German army was exhausted due to the long march; later, because the German transportation line, from its base to France, was 200 miles long, difficulties arose in transportation, all of which gave French General Joffre the opportunity to win the Battle of the Marne. Germany learned from the lessons of the last decision-making failure, and in terms of military strength, it is certain that this time it will be more sufficient. And in the past 20 years. The progress of military science is rapid, and the air force has become an important force in this decision-making war, which is enough to promote changes in the war situation. Therefore, in this decision-making war, the Allied forces attempted to frustrate the sharp momentum of the German offensive and form a stalemate trench warfare. The degree of difficulty is probably greater than in the last European war.

French Commander-in-Chief General Gamelin said in his speech encouraging the soldiers of the country, "The war has already begun. This war is related to the fate of our country, all allied countries and the entire world. … If our soldiers cannot move forward, they must not shrink from death in battle. We can only abide by one motto: that is, to die if we do not win." This is the same as the sentence in General Joffre's order on the Marne front in September 1914. Joffre said, "At the moment when the war, which is related to the safety of the country, is about to begin, I feel that I must urge you to pay attention to the fact that now is not the time to retreat. All forces must be concentrated on a counterattack to drive away the enemy. Troops that cannot advance must maintain the acquired position at all costs, and would rather maintain the position and die than retreat and live." Although the majority of the German army is still within the territory of Belgium and has not yet penetrated into France, it can be seen from General Gamelin's speech that France is already prepared to spare no effort to fight in order to frustrate the sharp momentum of the German army. News came from Paris that "the German tank corps failed in its attempt to advance towards Paris and was completely restricted and retreated nine miles due to the sharp counterattack of the French." This is of course not sufficient evidence that the sharp momentum of Germany has been exhausted, nor is it sufficient to regard it as the prelude to the victory of Britain and France, but the transition from the irresistible force of the German army to a stalemate between the two sides cannot but regard these nine miles as an important symbol. As for the final victory, it is still far away in time.

### Air Battle in Liangshan, Eastern Sichuan: Seven Japanese Aircraft Shot Down; The Location of Four Crashes Have Been Identified; The Remains of the Other Three Are Being Investigated

Chongqing: In the air battle in Liangshan, six Japanese aircraft were shot down by the Chinese army. A heavy bomber has now been found in an area 20 li north of Liangshan.

Chongqing: 24 Japanese heavy bombers invaded Sichuan Province from western Hubei on the 20th. They infiltrated the northwestern area of Liangshan at 7 AM and had the appearance of attacking Liangshan. A certain Chinese fighter plane had already detected it and took off to attack. It immediately formed a siege formation over Liangshan. At 7:45 AM, the Japanese aircraft risked flying over Liangshan. Seeing that the Japanese had fallen into the trap, the Chinese air force launched a thunderous posture and heavily surrounded the Japanese aircraft. The Japanese aircraft initially attempted to resist stubbornly, but were severely threatened by the Chinese high-altitude forces. The formation collapsed, and they struggled to break through. The Chinese heroes responsible for frontal interception gave the Japanese a head-on blow. The Japanese were timid and sought to escape and were strongly controlled by the Chinese pursuit force. Within effective range, they concentrated fire on several Japanese aircraft with maximum firepower. The Japanese aircraft somersaulted up and down, trying to escape. In an instant, two Japanese heavy bombers were hit by machine guns, exploded, and crashed. At this time, the Chinese air force's attack became more fierce. The Japanese could not break through and counterattacked the Chinese army. The Chinese high-altitude brave forces seized the opportunity of the Japanese chaos and controlled the three Japanese aircraft, aiming at the fuel tanks. The Japanese aircraft were all burned, and the tails fell, like withered red leaves. While the fierce battle was in progress, the remaining Japanese aircraft suddenly flew east. The Chinese army pursued bravely. One Japanese aircraft was shot down by the Chinese army halfway. The remaining Japanese aircraft fled to Wanxian County. An intense air battle came to an end. The Chinese army returned triumphantly. In total, the Chinese shot down six Japanese bombers in this battle. The location of the crash has been identified for three aircraft. One crashed in the eastern part of Zhongxian County. The fuselage was damaged, and the Japanese combatants were killed. Its serial number is 4528. One crashed at the foot of the Fenshuiling Mountain. The fuselage was burned, and the Japanese combatants parachuted and escaped. A search is underway. One crashed 20 li west of Kaixian County. Most of the Japanese aircraft was burned, and the Japanese combatants were killed. The last two digits of its serial number are 79. The other three crashed between Zhongxian County and Kaixian County. The Chinese are sending personnel to investigate. (20th)

Residents of Chongqing took refuge in air-raid shelters for six hours. Chengdu issued the first alert at 7:30 PM, and an emergency alert one hour later. The first batch of Japanese aircraft appeared in the sky at 8:35 PM. They apparently did not drop bombs, or they were very far from Chengdu. Twenty minutes later, the second batch of Japanese aircraft dropped flares and then dropped bombs near the southern suburbs. Twenty-five minutes later, the third batch of Japanese aircraft arrived and dropped several bombs near the southern suburbs again. The extent of the damage is currently unknown.

### Central United Weekly: He Yingqin's Report: The Japanese Invade Xiang in Five Routes

Chongqing: General He Yingqin, in his speech at the Central Executive Committee this morning, declared, "Only when China's territorial integrity is preserved and the Japanese army is completely expelled from Chinese territory can the final goal of the War of Resistance be said to be realized. All Chinese people must be of one heart and one mind, continue their efforts, and engage in resistance." (Reuter's, 20th)

Chongqing: At the Central Party Headquarters' National Government United Memorial Weekly Report on the Henan-Hubei Campaign on the 20th, He Yingqin stated that since the Japanese had continuously attacked the southern Henan and northern Hubei areas, Wuhan had been under constant threat. To ensure the safety of Wuhan and reduce the threat, the Japanese, in April of this year, drew troops from northern Jiangxi and northern Hunan, and concentrated troops within Hubei Province, aiming at Nanyang and Xiangfan, adopting a strategy of converging attacks to annihilate the Chinese army south of Nanyang and east of the Xiang River. Their invading forces totaled seven divisions, concentrated in the three areas of Xinyang, Suixian, and Zhongxiang, with a focus on the right flank (i.e., the Xinyang area). They began their offensive against China on May 1st. The Japanese forces from Xinyang and Suixian each advanced in two routes. The Japanese advance took on five routes: (1) From Shizhangtaiguan via Minggang, turning towards Biyang and Tanghe; (2) From Xinyang to Tongbai; (3) From Suixian to Zaoyang; (4) From Suixian to Wujiadian; (5) From Zhongxiang to Shuanggou. The Chinese forces, except for those resisting on the Suizao Road in the central area, gradually retreated to the Tanghe River basin while simultaneously defending Tongbai Mountain and Dahong Mountain. The main forces moved towards the left and right flanks of the Japanese to seize the initiative on the outer lines. The Japanese advanced blindly, and on the right flank, they occupied Minggang on May 1st, Biyang on the 6th, and Tanghe on the 8th. The central forces also broke through to Zaoyang on the 8th. On the left flank, they occupied Zhangjiaji on the 7th and continued to advance towards Xinye. By the 10th, the Japanese encirclement was complete, and the invading forces from all routes converged on the east side of the Xiang River and the banks of the Tangbai River. However, the encirclement failed, and the original plan was completely shattered. The Chinese outer flank forces instead pressed the Japanese left and right flanks towards the central area, encircling the majority of the Japanese forces in the plains east of the Xiang River. By the 10th, the Chinese encirclement was complete. They then retook Tanghe and Biyang, firmly encircling four Japanese divisions near Zaoyang and launching a fierce assault to annihilate them. Furthermore, a strong force advanced along the Hanyi Road, deep into the vicinity of Jingshan, Zaoshi, Yingcheng, and Anlu, attacking the Japanese rear and threatening Hankou. At the same time, another force occupied the strongholds of Wusheng Pass on the Pinghan Railway, cutting off the communication lines of the Japanese forces on all routes, making it impossible for the Japanese in Hankou to provide reinforcements. On the 14th, the Chinese forces also retook Changtaiguan, advanced towards Xinyang, and occupied the northwestern strongholds of the suburbs. On the afternoon of the 18th, they occupied Yangshan Station, stormed into Xinyang City, and engaged in fierce street fighting. Another force stormed into the airfield, killing hundreds of Japanese guards and destroying twelve Japanese aircraft. Currently, the railway between Xinyang and Wusheng Pass, as well as the Pingjing Pass on the Yingxin Highway, are completely cut off by the Chinese army. The Japanese forces encircled near Zaoyang have suffered heavy casualties, with Japanese corpses littering the field. By the afternoon of the 16th, the Chinese forces had retaken Zaoyang, and the Japanese retreated in disarray towards the southeast, still stubbornly resisting in the areas of Tangxian Town, Xinglongji, and Wujiadian south of Zaoyang a month ago. According to telegram confirmations, the actual number of Japanese killed in this campaign is 45,000, with over 60 artillery pieces, 2,000 horses, over 70 tanks, and over 400 vehicles captured. Other spoils of war are being inventoried. (20th dispatch)

### General Wei Gang Transferred to Allied Forces Commander-in-Chief, Also Chief of General Staff of French Defense Forces

Paris: Premier Reynaud met this afternoon with Cabinet Counselor and Minister without Portfolio General Pétain, as well as General Weygand, Commander-in-Chief of the Near East Forces, for an hour-long discussion. Afterwards, President Lebrun issued an order appointing General Weygand as Chief of the General Staff of the National Defense Forces and Commander-in-Chief of the Frontline Armies. (Havas, 19th)

Paris: General Weygand, the newly appointed Chief of the General Staff of the National Defense Forces and Commander-in-Chief of the Frontline Armies, is a renowned general of the present era. He was born in the capital of Belgium on January 22, 1867. At the outbreak of the European War in 1914, as a lieutenant colonel of the 5th Cavalry Regiment, he led his troops into battle. On August 28th of that year, he was appointed Chief of Staff by General Foch, commander of the 9th Army Corps. From then on, he followed General Foch until the end of the European War. On October 1, 1915, he was promoted to Chief of Staff of the Northern Army. He inflicted a major defeat on the enemy in the Battle of the Yser River. On March 26, 1918, he was promoted to Quartermaster General of the Allied Forces. After the signing of the Treaty of Versailles, he served as Secretary General of the Allied Military Commission. In 1920, he went to Warsaw to plan the repulsion of Soviet troops for the Polish army. He then served as Commander-in-Chief of the French Near East Forces. In 1924, he became a member of the Supreme Military Council and also served as Chief of Staff of the Army and Inspector General of the Army. When the European War broke out again last September, he was reappointed as Commander-in-Chief of the Near East Forces. Due to the urgency of the Western Front, he has now been transferred to his current position. (Havas, 19th)

Paris: General Weygand was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Forces last night, succeeding General Gamelin. General Weygand is a strategist of Belgian origin. He arrived in Paris from Syria yesterday. It is widely believed that after General Weygand takes office, the Allied forces will shift from defensive warfare to offensive warfare. Military observers say that General Weygand led the Allied forces to victory in the last European War and will launch a bold strategy this time, unlike Gamelin's excessive caution. As for General Gamelin's future position, it is kept secret. General Weygand's appointment was approved by the British government and Prime Minister Churchill. This change of history was decided after a one-hour meeting yesterday between Premier Reynaud, General Pétain, and General Weygand. General Gamelin was not present. (Reuter's, 20th)

The German army has made slight progress in the northwest. According to the opinion of people here, it is difficult to analyze the accurate situation of the war. It is reported that the German and French armies are now mixed together in various places. In some areas, the German army is behind the French line, while in other areas, the French army is behind the German line. (Reuter's, 20th)

Paris: The General Headquarters issued a battle report stating, "Our army is resolutely resisting northeast of Saint-Quentin, and the fighting is extremely fierce. The enemy's repeated attacks near Montmédy were repelled. The enemy suffered heavy losses. The air forces of both sides are very active. Our fighters and anti-aircraft batteries shot down many enemy planes. On one occasion, a group of fifteen enemy planes was shot down nine by our army." (Havas, 19th)

London: The General Headquarters of the British Expeditionary Force issued a communiqué stating that yesterday the enemy launched several attacks on British positions within French territory, all of which were repelled. (Havas, 20th)

London: Last night, the British Headquarters declared that the British front line was able to maintain its original state under enemy pressure today (Sunday). (Reuter's, 20th)

German Army Emphasizes Left Flank Warfare, Encountering Fierce Resistance from Allied Forces

Paris: Regarding the Western Front, observers here recently stated that the German authorities clearly intend to decide the outcome with the left flank army. Their mechanized units, operating on a 50-60 kilometer front between the Sambre and Oise Rivers, consist of four or five divisions. These units are currently exerting all their efforts to advance westward. It is generally believed that this is the main objective of the German army, and the military actions on other fronts are only intended to contain or disperse French forces. However, the mechanized units have encountered fierce resistance from the Anglo-French Allied forces. In recent days, both sides have used large numbers of tanks in battle, supplemented by automatic machine gun squads and motorcycle squads. Therefore, there is no fixed front line. The reason why a few German motorcycle squads were able to advance to the vicinity of Laon some days ago and once reached Beronne last night is due to this. As for the southeast of this large-scale "tank warfare," there have only been some local actions. These are further recounted as follows: (1) Some German units attempted to seize some bridges on the Aisne River, but only two units crossed the river in certain areas within Rethel. The other units were all repelled by the French army. The two units in Rethel were all captured. (2) Montmédy is the starting point of the Maginot Line. The defense there is mainly based on giant fortresses, surrounded by medium-sized bunkers, and in front are numerous small bunkers, all equipped with automatic machine guns to protect the fortresses. When some German units attacked the defenses of the city, only one unit managed to occupy a small bunker, and the other units were repelled by the French army and suffered electrical shocks. (3) The line from Montmédy to the Swiss border is quite calm, with nothing worth mentioning. (Havas, 20th)

### Notre Dame Cathedral: Praying for French Victory; U.S. Ambassador Bullitt Also Attends

Paris: This afternoon, a prayer service was held at Notre Dame Cathedral to pray for French victory. Premier Reynaud, Foreign Minister Daladier, other cabinet ministers, and members of the diplomatic corps, especially U.S. Ambassador Bullitt, attended the service. Archbishop of Paris, Cardinal Baudrillart, who presided over the service, declared in his sermon, "The reason we are fighting is not to gain benefits, but to fight against the evil and brutality. We firmly believe that we will achieve final victory. The consciousness of the whole world has been expressed by Pope Pius XII. We have received encouragement from this. To maintain our faith, we pray devoutly." (Havas, 19th)

French Tank Brigade Counterattacks Along the River, Forcing German Army to Retreat Nine Miles

French Army Positions: Yesterday afternoon, French tank brigades launched a fierce counterattack against the German army along the Sambre River and the Oise Canal on the Picardy Plain. After fierce fighting, they forced the German army to retreat. This retreat was the first for the German army after invading French territory. Both the German and French sides used tanks against each other yesterday. As a result of the fierce fighting, the German offensive towards Paris has been completely stopped, and the German army has been forced to retreat nine miles. It is said that the French army retook Le Cateau and Le Catelet and is holding the banks of the Oise River between Mormal Forest and Saint-Quentin. On Saturday and Sunday, the French field artillery prevented the German tank brigades from advancing. Yesterday, they were densely lined up along the Sambre River and the Oise River, wiping out two German motorized infantry detachments. The German tank brigades were forced to retreat from Le Cateau through the Oise River and Le Catelet because the motorized infantry was defeated by the French tank brigades. Yesterday, the French army launched its first counterattack against the German tank brigades with small and large tanks. The German army still used the same tactics as in the invasion of Poland, with a large number of tanks charging forward, followed by motorized infantry in a long, single-file formation. The French side believes that the only way to deal with this armored force is to use more tanks to stop it. The French army used this method to deal with the German army yesterday. When the anti-tank mines that the French army had planted on Saturday and Sunday exploded, they destroyed dozens of German tanks. However, when the second batch of German tanks continued to advance towards the French army, the French army did not have time to replant anti-tank mines to stop the German tanks from advancing. Instead, they created a steel wall with 77mm light anti-tank guns and tanks. Also, in the area of An and Somme in the Oise River basin, the German army launched the most violent attacks, but it was unable to break through the French army's iron wall. Yesterday, both the German and Allied air forces were very active in assisting the advance of the tank brigades. The sky was filled with aircraft, and the sunlight was dimmed. French tank brigades launched flanking attacks on German motorized units from time to time. The French heavy artillery also bombarded German tanks. Yesterday's tank brigade battle along the Oise River basin was unprecedented in history. French officers claimed that the French counterattack had at least stopped the advance of the German tank brigades and given the Allied forces a good opportunity to reorganize their ranks during their strategic retreat in Belgium. Allied and German troops have been fighting fiercely for a week. During this period, the troops on both sides did not get sleep or food, but the soldiers on both sides did not show signs of fatigue yesterday. This was the first time that France had stopped German armored forces from rushing from the Rhine River to the Oise River. On the front line, all rifles, machine guns, and small direct-fire cannons were unable to stop the advance of the German large tanks, followed by small tanks. During the German advance, its large tanks, numbering about 400, were deployed in formations, firing fiercely in all directions at a speed of 12 to 20 miles per hour, then charging and attacking on a large scale. The French army quickly coordinated tanks and heavy artillery to repel the German tank brigades and inflict serious damage on the German motorized infantry. Allied aircraft were continuously active yesterday, attacking German rear guard units and pontoon bridges built across the Meuse River for 17 hours. A total of 11 pontoon bridges were destroyed by heavy bombers, which had a significant impact on German rear transportation. Last night, the German positions in French territory resembled a waist shape, 30 miles deep and 50 miles wide. The front line extended from Mormal Forest through Le Catelet, Guise, Rethel, to Sedan. In theory, this battle is favorable to France, because France has better transportation lines, while the German army must pass through Belgium's narrow transportation lines, and there are no good roads behind the German front line. If the German army cannot expand from Sedan, it will not be able to use the good highway through Luxembourg, because the front line is too long. The German army's important transportation line is from Maastricht, along the Meuse River, through Liège, Namur, Dinant, to Mézières. If the fortresses of Liège and Namur remain in the hands of the Belgian army, the German transportation line will still be threatened by fierce artillery fire. The Franco-German war has reached a critical juncture. (Reuter's, 20th)

Allied Forces Withdraw from Northern Belgium: Important Military Installations Completely Destroyed

Paris: It is reported that when the Allied forces organized their withdrawal from northern Belgium, they completely destroyed all important military installations. The Dutch army on the island of Zeeland has held out for some time and has received reinforcements from the Allied forces. The Dutch army has destroyed all naval and land installations and gasoline and storage facilities in the naval dockyards of the island and the port of Flushing. Now the Dutch army has left Zeeland and is continuing to fight alongside the Allied forces. (Reuter's, 20th)

London: The withdrawal of the British Expeditionary Force from Belgium is now being carried out with great skill. German rumors that the British army has abandoned a large number of war supplies are false. The British army has not abandoned any war supplies. The British army has shown its agility in the past ten days, which is enough to characterize it as a well-trained army. As for its combat capability, it goes without saying. The British and Belgian troops in Belgium are now accustomed to aerial bombardment. They have taken adequate precautions and have not suffered significant losses. In short, the British army has not suffered large-scale losses. (Reuter's, 20th)

German Leader's Headquarters: German Army Claims: The German army is pursuing the enemy in Belgium and has reached the upper reaches of the Scheldt River. The French and Belgian troops near Mormal Forest and south of Valenciennes have been repelled by the German army, with heavy casualties. The tank units suffered particularly heavy losses. The enemy's attempt to break through to the south failed and they have now retreated to the west. In the southwest of this area, German armored columns and mechanized units have reached the Somme River. The battlefield of the European War in 1916 was here. German bombers defeated the enemy's armored units. All the forts of Liège and Namur, except for one that is still resisting stubbornly, have fallen into the hands of the German army. Yesterday, the German air force bombed transportation lines and highways in northern France and Belgium even more intensely than before, and continued to attack enemy air force bases, returning in triumph. On the coasts of France and Belgium, two enemy destroyers were sunk and another destroyer and three merchant ships were severely damaged. Yesterday, the enemy lost 143 aircraft, of which 95 were destroyed in aerial combat, 15 were shot down by anti-aircraft guns, and the rest were destroyed on the airfield by bombing. 31 German aircraft are missing. Last night, British bombers randomly dropped bombs in western Germany without any targets. Several civilians were killed or injured. The only military target was a prisoner-of-war camp, where some prisoners were killed. (Haitong Agency, 20th)

Berlin: Yesterday, the highest German military authorities sent a military communiqué to the Haitong Agency, which contained a very detailed account of the war situation. The communiqué stated that Antwerp is no longer a military obstacle, and the assistance of the Allied troops on the northern flank has also been cut off. In the past few days, the Belgian army and the Anglo-French Allied forces have continued to retreat and transfer to new positions. In recent days, although the events have been extensive, the German losses have been less than before, while the Allied losses have been greater than before, because the German army is gradually penetrating the enemy and using air force to bomb fiercely. And now the southern flank at Laon and near Le Chesne is waging a bloody battle. The eastern German army continues to attack the French positions. On the Maginot Line, the German army occupied the fort near Montmédy, which is one of the strongest forts on the Maginot Line. The German army used tank units to attack fiercely, and the German air force concentrated on bombing the retreating troops of the enemy, the transportation routes, and the rear transportation equipment. The German army obtained the cooperation of the air force, and advanced fiercely step by step according to the original plan. The enemy's railways and important highways have been bombed and damaged. The German navy used sophisticated technology to lay mines off the coast of southern Phi. Such an adventurous and courageous act has terrified the enemy, because Britain has strict defenses with the help of the southern Phi air force. According to this, Germany is not only taking the initiative in the land and air forces, but also in the navy. (Haitong Agency, 20th)

Berlin: After the main Belgian defense line was broken, a person close to the German command headquarters told the Haitong Agency reporter that there were three important events in yesterday's battle: (1) The Allied forces in northern Belgium and France have completely retreated; (2) The German army is pursuing the victory and advancing directly to the west; (3) The Allied forces are retreating in two directions, northwest and southwest. (Haitong Agency, 20th)

Berlin: According to a report from the German command headquarters, the German army has captured a total of 100,000 prisoners in recent days. Among them, there are only a few thousand British prisoners, which shows that the number of British troops fighting on the Western Front is still not as large as that of its allies. (Haitong Agency, 20th)

Berlin: German war correspondent Schmidtke recently described the defeat of the French heavy tanks by the German army, saying that the fierce battle on the Meuse River has collapsed the stubborn resistance of the French army. The speed of the German advance is like lightning. The enemy army did not have time to retreat and was almost completely disorganized. The French heavy tanks were bombarded by the German artillery units and could not withstand it and retreated. Among them, the steel plates of 19 tanks were 6 centimeters thick and were extremely strong and could be described as small mobile fortresses. The length of the car was 7 feet, and the height and width were 3 meters. However, the German anti-tank guns finally defeated them. (Haitong Agency, 20th)

Berlin: A German radio station reported last night that the German army is only 62 miles from Paris. According to official military intelligence, German troops have approached certain important French and Belgian fortresses on the Dover Strait opposite England. This advance is like that of 1914. (Reuter's, 20th)

Forts of Liège and Namur Still Held by Belgian Troops

London: A local radio station recently issued a message stating that although the forts of Liège and Namur in Belgium have been heavily surrounded by the enemy and have been subjected to constant and fierce bombing by enemy aircraft, they are still being held by Belgian troops. The enemy's repeated attacks have all failed, and corpses are scattered all around the forts. (Havas, 19th)

London: The Belgian army is still holding the forts of Liège and Namur, which is a model of the Belgian army's heroic resistance. These two places are both extremely important points, because every railway leading to the current German front line must pass through Liège or Namur, and the German army relies on these railways to transport military supplies. London experts believe that even if the Belgian army does nothing else and only holds these two forts, it is still fulfilling its full responsibility in the efforts of the Allied forces. (Reuter's, 20th)

### 比境歐本等區　德國併入版圖　殷嘉德被任為駐荷專員

Berlin. The German official news agency announced that Hitler has appointed Inquart (former Austrian Minister of the Interior) as Commissioner for the German-occupied territories in the Netherlands. At the same time, Hitler ordered the incorporation of Eupen, Malmedy, and Moresnet areas of Belgium into Germany. It is noted that after World War I, the Treaty of Versailles stipulated that Germany should cede the Eupen and Malmedy areas to Belgium. The Moresnet area was once a neutral zone between Prussia and Belgium, and was assigned to Belgium after the war as compensation for damage done by Germans to Belgian forests. In his new position, Inquart will be responsible for maintaining public order and life in the German-occupied territories in the Netherlands, reporting to Hitler and wielding supreme power over the Dutch civilians. However, the supreme military power will remain in the hands of the German commander in the Netherlands, who has the power to take necessary measures to ensure military order and security. Current Dutch laws that are compatible with the German occupation will remain in effect. (Reuters, 20th)

### 倫敦各報　觀察戰局　雖頗嚴重　但非絕望

London. Today, all newspapers here strongly argue that the war situation, although serious, is not hopeless. The Daily Telegraph reports that although the war has now extended to the northeastern borders of France, the decisive moment is still far away. The path of the Nazi mechanized forces' advance yesterday was the same route that the German army took to enter France in 1914. We must not overlook the heavy losses of the German army and the danger that the German westward attack poses to the Allied front lines, nor can we judge the war situation based on the extent of territory occupied by the German army after breaking through the Meuse River line of defense. The outcome of the war depends on the Allied powers' ability to prevent sufficient German infantry from arriving. If rear support cannot arrive continuously, the advance of its armored vehicle units will come to a halt, and the tank columns will not be able to survive. Currently, the fighting around the German breakthrough is becoming increasingly fierce. It is difficult to predict when the limits of human effort can be reached in this terrible mechanized warfare. According to eyewitness reports, although German soldiers are piling up like mountains, the Nazis' cruel discipline has not been lost for a single day. The ability to drive German men to engage in slaughter remains, and Hitler may not be able to spare his "cannon fodder." However, once the machinery is destroyed or its fuel is cut off, no matter how cruel, it cannot be driven to action. French artillery has engaged German tanks, and aerial bombing has destroyed many vehicles. Our air force has been paying attention to reconnaissance of German transportation routes, especially the highways and railways of the Ardennes, and has discovered that they are insufficient to support a large-scale offensive. Therefore, the German advance may be forced to halt due to transportation failures. The Times reports that the German army's massive offensive has already sown the seeds of its own failure, and its maturity is only a matter of time. There is no tendency towards discouragement in Britain regarding the current war situation. Our attitude towards France's struggle against adversity is fully demonstrated by Prime Minister Churchill's recent trip to Paris. Churchill's trip carried encouragement for the struggle, all possible assistance, and the assurance of the fullest cooperation between the two countries in the current great endeavor. All our hopes are pinned on General Georges and his troops, who are fighting for the safety of Britain and France and the future of civilization. Regardless of the future of this war or how it develops, our determination and goals will remain unchanged. (Reuters, 20th)

### 德軍方面　又一新武器　燃燒手溜彈

Berlin. The German side announced today that Germany has now produced a powerful new secret weapon, the incendiary hand grenade. This weapon can melt the most solid equipment of the Maginot Line. According to the German authorities, this weapon contains a heat of 2,000 degrees, which can make guns useless and burn to death those inside the pillboxes. This weapon has been used at the Belgian fortresses of Eben-Emael and Émeraude north of Liège. (United Press, 20th)

### 比政府　遷往法境　聖亞特萊斯鎭

Ostend, Belgium. German squadrons of aircraft continuously flew over and bombed this city on the nights of the 17th and 18th of this month. Belgium has therefore requested France to move its government to the town of Saint-Adresse near the port of Le Havre in France, as it did during the last European war. It is also learned that the British and French ambassadors left at 11 a.m. (Havas, 19th)

Le Havre, France. After the Belgian government moved to Saint-Adresse near this port, several members of the cabinet, such as Minister of Justice Janssens, Minister of Colonies Chabanel, and Minister of Health Jaspar, have arrived in the town. Among them, Jaspar has gone to Paris to prepare to go to London. In addition, Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak has also arrived there, and the Ministries of Foreign Affairs and National Defense have begun working. (Havas, 20th)

### 齊亞諾明白聲言　義國準備參加歐戰　墨索里尼不日將發號施令　北部城市已從事防空戒備

Rome. Foreign Minister Ciano clearly stated yesterday in Milan to 75,000 people that Italy intends to join the European war. The Italian nation "cannot stand apart from the rise and fall of Europe's destiny." Ciano also spoke at the anniversary of the German-Italian axis, stating, "Italy will honor its responsibilities... and move towards its greater destiny." He also said that Italy will be recognized at the final end of the war, and the crowd frequently held up slogans such as "Long Live Italy." Ciano also emphasized, "The need to achieve our ultimate natural desires is essential for our nation's life and indispensable." He said that Prime Minister Mussolini will issue orders soon. (United Press, 20th)

Milan. Foreign Minister Ciano recently delivered a speech to the Blackshirt Army in the square in front of the cathedral here, stating that "The Italian people must be prepared to cope with new responsibilities. These responsibilities are indicated by the following three ideas: Our country is a sovereign state and should protect its rights, this is the first. Our country's wishes are extremely just and essential for survival, so they can be called natural desires and should eventually be realized, this is the second. Our country should maintain the prestige of a great power and keep its promises and destiny, this is the third. Our Italian nation has fought in Abyssinia and Spain, and cannot stand apart from European events, it must have the right to speak, and it will be able to speak. Once our leader (referring to Mussolini) makes a decision, we will receive instructions. It must be known that these instructions are issued by our one and only leader, who is our only leader in peacetime, and also in wartime." (Havas, 19th)

Rome. Since the outbreak of the European war, northern Italy has initially been ordered to carry out air defense preparations. According to authorities, important industrial areas in Milan and other towns near the French border will begin blackouts and air defense alerts starting today.

In addition, the government authorities have also issued an order prohibiting the export of Egyptian and foreign currency abroad. The currency carried by tourists leaving the country must not exceed 20 pounds. As for those coming to Egypt to travel, they should declare the foreign currency they are carrying to the government upon entry. (Havas, 20th)

### 邱吉爾廣播　承認大局嚴重　以動人之詞表示決心　採嚴峻步驟剛毅作戰

London. Prime Minister Churchill, last night gave a broadcast speech to the nation and the Empire, expressing in moving terms his strong confidence in the French army and its leaders, and expressing the resolute determination to fight until victory is achieved.

Strong Confidence in French Army Leaders

The Prime Minister said, "I have received the most solemn assurances from the leaders of the French Republic, especially the strong Prime Minister Reynaud, stating that no matter how the future changes, they will fight to the end. The result may be pain or glory, but if we fight to the end, what we can obtain is glory alone."

The Prime Minister continued, "If this is one of the most shocking times in the long history of France and Britain, it is also one of the noblest times. There is no doubt that the people of Britain and France are standing shoulder to shoulder, receiving assistance only from their great dominions and the friends of their vast empires. Now they are advancing shoulder to shoulder to save not only Europe but also mankind from the poison of the most despicable and soul-destroying tyrants, who have stained the pages of history."

"Behind them, behind us, behind the British and French armies and navies, are several broken countries and oppressed nations, namely the Czech Republic, Poland, Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, and Belgium. The long night of barbarism will now descend upon them, and even if there are stars of hope, they will not be enough to break it unless we win. But we must win, and we will win."

Both Sides are in Dangerous Positions

"I am addressing you today as Prime Minister for the first time at one of the most solemn moments in the life of our country, the Empire, ourselves, and our allies. More importantly, I am making this statement for the sake of freedom. A fierce battle is currently taking place in France and Flanders. The German army, with the aid of fierce aerial bombardment and heavy armored tanks, has broken through the French defenses north of the Maginot Line. Their large numbers of armored vehicles are now trampling across the plains, which, in the first few days, had no defending troops at all. The German army has now advanced deeply and is spreading fear and disruption along the way. Behind them are trucks full of infantry, and behind the trucks are large numbers of soldiers, pouring forward continuously. Therefore, the French army is reorganizing to resist the enemy and strike them. This extended wedge has been advancing for several days and has been aided by the heroic performance of the Royal Air Force. We must not be shocked by the sudden appearance of these armored vehicles in various places behind our lines. If they have reached behind our lines, the French army is also fighting behind the enemy lines in many places. Both sides are now in extremely dangerous positions. If the French army and our army can fight well, and I believe they will, if the French army can maintain its long-standing reputation for recovery and counterattack, and if the British army can persevere and fight hard, as there have been many examples in the past, then the war situation may suddenly change."

"However, it would be foolish to try to conceal the seriousness of the situation today. It would be even more foolish to lose heart or believe that a large, well-trained and equipped army of three to four million men can be overcome in a matter of weeks or months by the rapid attacks of mechanized vehicles. For even though mechanized vehicles are fierce, they have no such ability. We can have great confidence in the stability of the French lines, and the British and French soldiers will certainly demonstrate their quality in this fierce battle, which is comparable to that of the enemy. This can be seen with our own eyes."

"As for me personally, my confidence in the French army and its leaders is unshakable. Only a small part of the French army is currently engaged in fierce fighting, and only a small part of French territory has been invaded. There is now good evidence that the enemy has actually committed all of its special mechanized units to the major war. We also know that they have suffered very heavy losses."

Restoring the Initiative Depends on Valor

"All those who encounter the enemy and engage in close combat, whether they are officers or soldiers, whether they are brigades or divisions, can make valuable contributions to the overall result. The military authorities must abandon the idea that they can only defend against the enemy's attacks by relying on natural obstacles and strong defensive lines. They must know that restoring the initiative depends on a valiant and unyielding offensive. This spirit should not only encourage high command but also be instilled in every soldier. In the sky, we often win with fewer numbers, and the disparity in numbers is often a ratio of three or four to one. The balance of power between the British and German air forces has now put us in an advantageous position, which is very different from when the war broke out. We are not only fighting for ourselves, but also fighting for the French army, and we are reducing the number of German bombers day by day. My confidence in our air force's ability to fight to the end with the German air force has been strengthened by the fierce battles that have taken place in the past and are taking place now. At the same time, our heavy bombers are now striking at the root of Germany's mechanized power, as they have heavily damaged the oil refineries on which the Nazis' efforts to dominate the world directly depend. Now that the enemy, who is expected to destroy the Netherlands and turn it into ashes in a few days, will turn to attack us once the Western Front is stabilized, we must be prepared for this."

Encouraging the People to Serve the Country

"When I say that we are prepared to deal with this attack and will endure it and retaliate as far as the unwritten laws of war allow, I dare to say that I am speaking to the entire nation. If calamities befall this island in the future, every man and every woman will share the dangers faced by our sons on the front lines, such as soldiers, sailors, and pilots, and by doing so, at least reduce part of the attacks suffered on the front lines, then they must be comforted at heart and even proud. At this time, shouldn't everyone in the nation do their best to serve the country? If we want the war to be won, we must supply the nation's needs with an ever-increasing supply of arms and ammunition. We must quickly produce more aircraft, tanks, and artillery shells. All these important munitions are needed in huge quantities. This can increase our strength to resist a heavily armed enemy. This can compensate for the increased consumption in combat. If the soldiers on the front lines know that the munitions consumed can be quickly replenished, they will use the abundant munitions even faster."

"Our task is not only to win one battle but to win the overall victory. When the current major war in France can reduce its strength, the major war on this island will begin. By this island, I mean the entire United Kingdom. In this moment of supreme emergency, we will not hesitate and take all kinds of steps, even the most severe steps, to exert our last effort."

"The interests of industry and the hours of work are not worth considering compared to the struggle for life and honor, for life and freedom are what everyone of us depends on for survival. I have received the most solemn assurances from the leaders of France, stating that no matter how the future changes, they will fight to the end until victory is achieved. Entrusted by the King, I have formed a government of men and women from all parties, including various opinions. We used to argue with each other because of differing opinions, but now we are united to wage war, and we will not rest until victory is achieved, no matter how great the price or how deep the pain, we will never surrender to slavery and disgrace." (Reuters, 20th)

### 羅斯福論改進　自由經濟　為美重要政策

Washington. US Secretary of State Hull, last night read a message from President Roosevelt on a radio broadcast, stating that one of the most important parts of the United States' foreign policy is to improve free economic policy. The world is currently undergoing major destruction, and once this destructive force ends, the United States, if it wants to rebuild the world economy, must follow this method. The United States has a very large stake in the construction and preservation of world peace and stability. (United Press, 20th)

New York. The New York Times of the Democratic Party recently reported that President Roosevelt, due to the seriousness of the European war situation, the American people are worried, and the national defense plan he proposed has also been approved by the people of the country.

### 英轟炸機隊　破壞德交通綫　戰鬥機隊從事攻勢巡邏

London. The British Air Ministry announced that British bomber squadrons were very active in Belgium and France yesterday, with the aim of disrupting the German army's transportation lines and relieving the pressure on the Allied forces. When our fighter jets assisted the bomber squadrons in patrolling, they shot down many enemy aircraft of various types. According to the first received report, which only mentioned the activities of our fighter jets, at least 20 enemy aircraft have been shot down. At night, our heavy bomber squadrons continued to harass the enemy, bombing bridges and roads in southern Belgium to block them, and dispersing enemy concentrations. At the same time, other bomber squadrons flew deep into Germany at night to Hanau and hit oil tanks, and attacked other railway junctions and branch lines in various places, causing heavy damage. British aircraft continuously monitored military traffic and frequently attacked enemy actions over a vast area of western Germany throughout the night, bombing railway and highway traffic. A certain point was hit and exploded with a loud noise, and buildings at an airfield caught fire. Hudson-style British aircraft also carried out night attacks, causing continued damage to oil tanks in Hamburg and Bremen. Two Blenheim-style British aircraft patrolled off the coast of the Netherlands and attacked three German Heinkel 111s and three Messerschmitt 110s, shooting down two Messerschmitt-style German aircraft. According to a subsequent communiqué issued by the Air Ministry, British Air Force fighter jets carried out offensive patrols over France and Belgium yesterday. One squadron of Hurricane fighter jets shot down three to six Heinkel-style German aircraft near Brussels. Another squadron with a larger number of aircraft only encountered two enemy aircraft. It is believed that one of the enemy aircraft, a Heinkel 111, has been shot down. (Reuters, 20th)

Berlin. According to the German military newspaper yesterday, 147 enemy aircraft were shot down. Over the skies near Tournai, 12 German Messerschmitt bombers and 20 French Morane fighters were shot down. Four French Potez 63s were shot down immediately. In addition, a British Bleriot bomber, which was parked at the airfield, was also destroyed. At the French Air Force base in Vitry-le-François, many French Morane aircraft were bombed and burned while refueling, when the German Air Force attacked. At another airfield, when the German Air Force bombed, 16 French Morane aircraft and 4 Potez aircraft were destroyed. On the same day, aircraft at many other airfields were also bombed.

### 降落傘隊　作戰方法　德國效法於蘇聯

Stockholm. The Swedish "Dagens Nyheter" recently published a dispatch from Moscow stating that the German army's use of paratroopers in the Western Front to achieve victory was actually invented by the late Soviet Deputy People's Commissar for Defense, General Tukhachevsky (who was executed in the purge). His original plan was to train 100,000 paratroopers and form them into an elite force. For several years, the Soviet authorities had been training 60,000 people in accordance with his will, but abandoned it halfway because they later revealed this secret to Germany. Unexpectedly, once Germany imitated this method, it established a miraculous feat in the Western Front war. (Havas, 20th)

### 荷印遠征軍　赴歐參戰　各校廢德文課程

### French Premier Warns the Nation

Paris: Premier Reynaud has cautioned the people of the nation not to readily believe enemy propaganda, stating that the enemy is attempting to undermine our nation’s production by spreading false rumors, such as the relocation of our industrial heartland due to the German advance. In reality, our industrial zones are under no threat and need no relocation, which should be decided by the military and political authorities. The government will severely punish those who spread such rumors. (Havas dispatch, 20th)

### The Puppet Regime in Beiping Receives Lukewarm Reception from the Japanese; Old Five-Color Flag Still Used; Independent Status Unaffected

A Beiping dispatch in the *North-China Daily News*, dated May 4th, states that Beiping celebrated the establishment of the "new regime" from April 25th to 27th, but the public and the authorities were apathetic. There were few signs of celebration anywhere. Even the paper flower arches erected in one or two main thoroughfares lacked banners or slogans explaining the meaning of the celebration. The "mass rally" held in front of the Taihe Gate was attended by

very few people. Speakers delivered lengthy, monotonous speeches over loudspeakers. Despite their vocal exertions, they failed to arouse the slightest interest among the audience. Delegates from the surrounding rural areas were escorted to the rally by large groups of police, ostensibly to prevent these "volunteers" from escaping midway. Of particular note, although the celebrations were for the establishment of the "new regime," no "Kuomintang flag" was to be seen. The marchers all carried

the old five-color flag. A Japanese spokesperson attempted to explain this by saying, "This is purely a spontaneous celebration by the Chinese people. The Japanese cannot interfere. The Xinminhui, which initiated the march, adopted the five-color flag." However, the spokesperson could not explain why, if the Chinese people were celebrating the "new regime," they were carrying the flag of the "Xinminhui." Even if he did, it would not have helped, because

the Japanese in North China have openly expressed their aversion to the puppet regime. At the official celebration held in Zhongnanhai Park, Wang Kemin and other "members of the North China Political Affairs Commission," as well as senior Japanese civil and military officials, delivered speeches. They rarely mentioned the puppet regime, focusing instead on the suppression of the Communists and the many difficulties that still lay ahead. Chinese newspapers here say that the public administrative organs in North China will henceforth be prefixed with "North China" and will remove the previously used "Central." It is strange that the resolutions of a special meeting recently held here by the Asia Development Board have not been disclosed. It is rumored that the reason for the silence after the meeting is that difficulties have arisen between North China and the "new regime"

over financial issues. All of this clearly indicates that the purpose and independent status of the North China regime have not been affected by the establishment of the "new regime." The timing of the celebration of the new regime here coincided with an attack on Kaifeng by Chinese regular forces, which was a great anticlimax. The Japanese side has denied the Chongqing claim of killing 2,000 Japanese soldiers, but it is

a fact that Chinese regular forces penetrated the center of Kaifeng. The incident appears to have been a surprise attack by Chinese forces on a small Japanese garrison in Kaifeng at dawn, penetrating the city center. Although they withdrew after Japanese reinforcements arrived, the Chinese forces achieved a brief victory that

greatly undermined the prestige of the Japanese army, which had repeatedly boasted that all of North China was now pacified. This also confirms the opinions repeatedly expressed by foreign military observers, that the Japanese are now trying to maintain the countryside with insufficient troops, and that their position is extremely precarious if attacked by Chinese forces. There are also reports of continuous fierce fighting in southern Shanxi, which can be confirmed by

the continuous return of large numbers of wounded soldiers and cremation ashes to the north. Even the suburbs of Beiping are not peaceful. Fighting continues on the slopes across the Hun River. Four days ago, Chinese regular forces intercepted a long-distance bus on the main road south of Changxindian. From this, it can be concluded that if Tokyo truly believes that the establishment of the puppet regime can quickly end armed resistance in China or resolve the "China Incident" in a short period of time, then it is overly optimistic.

### Armies Contend for Decisive Points in Chaojie; Intense Fighting Between Qingma Mountain and Fengxi

Shantou Correspondence: In the battle situation in eastern Guangdong, Chinese and Japanese forces are vying for decisive points on the Anjie border. Chinese troops are stationed in Jieyang, while Japanese troops are concentrated in Chao'an City, Fort City, and Qingma Mountain. The Japanese army must attack the commanding heights to invade Jieyang, and the Chinese army is determined to defend them. Fengxi and Fuyang are the main transportation routes of Chaoshan, and they are the commanding heights for the Chinese army to recover lost land. The Japanese army is determined to defend them. In recent months, both sides have engaged in a tug-of-war, sacrificing countless soldiers, all for this purpose.

On April 25th, Chinese forces recovered Dengtang, a stronghold on the Anjie road. On the 28th and 29th, they fiercely attacked Datouling, Fugang, and Shaxi (northeast of Sangpu Mountain) west of the Chaoshan Railway. New artillery units also mobilized to assist in the battle. On the afternoon of the 28th, Datouling was captured, annihilating over a hundred Japanese soldiers. On the morning of the 29th, Fugang was captured. The remaining Japanese soldiers retreated in disarray to Anbu. After May 1st, large numbers of Chinese troops arrived continuously to reinforce the defenses of Fort City, Fugang, Yujiao, and Dengtang, and attacked Qingma Mountain, Lianhu, and Baishui Village. These locations were Japanese artillery positions with four layers of barbed wire. On the 3rd, Chinese forces completely surrounded them, broke through the nets, and engaged in bayonet fighting on the northern slopes of Qingma Mountain. After six hours of intense fighting, they occupied it, capturing a large amount of ammunition, equipment, and documents. The remaining Japanese soldiers retreated to Fuyang Station. The Japanese and puppet forces in Chao'an City were greatly alarmed and increased their troops to defend Mabei, Chihu, Xiasi, and Zhugaoshan. Chinese forces took advantage of the victory to pursue them fiercely. On the 4th, they once charged into Fuyang City. Japanese commander Hori urgently dispatched 1,000 Japanese and puppet troops from Shantou and Anbu to reinforce. The Japanese and puppet forces in Shantou and Chenghai were unusually busy with troop movements. At dawn on the 5th, 400 Japanese soldiers (with cavalry and artillery) from Chao'an City left the west gate, passing through Xiasi to defend Fengxi. The artillery fire was extremely intense. The vanguard of the Chinese army quickly retreated out of Fengxi and scattered in the fields. In the afternoon, Chinese reinforcements arrived and launched a counterattack in multiple directions. Those who set out from Tiandongxu in Fengshun attacked Guihu, Toutang, and Pojieling upstream of Chao'an, capturing several strongholds in succession and approaching Zhugaoshan and Yixi Station. The Japanese troops on Bijia Mountain, Danganshi, Yuntishan, and Aoling Mountain in the suburbs of Chao'an fired in response. The artillery fire was deafening, preventing Chinese troops from approaching Chao'an City. Therefore, troops were sent south from Linmapo to flank the Japanese troops in Fengxi. At ten o'clock that night, the Chinese troops approaching Chao'an City directly attacked Guxiang in Fengxi, echoing the Chinese troops who went south from Linjiapo. The Jing army suffered over 300 casualties after a day and night of bloody battles and stubbornly resisted the dangerous situation. On the 6th, they were trapped in Fengxi awaiting assistance, in a very embarrassing situation. On the morning of the same day at five o'clock, the Japanese army also dispatched a warship to Yixi to anchor, firing more than ten shots at Gulong and Zhuxiang (twenty li above Chao'an City on the Han River) to cover two Japanese electric boats attempting to transport troops to shore. Local militias fired wildly, preventing the Japanese electric boats from approaching the shore. Around 7:00 AM, the Japanese warship began to retreat. At this time, Shantou had no troops to dispatch. Over a hundred puppet troops from Waisha in Chenghai were transferred to Longhu to land, intending to go to Fuyang to assist in the battle. Local villagers (in the occupied area) feared being robbed and resisted by sounding gongs, engaging in a fierce battle with the Japanese and puppet troops for an hour. The Japanese and puppet troops suffered over thirty casualties and it was difficult to pass through the village, so they retreated one after another, leaving in boats. Before leaving, they declared that they would carry out a clear-out of the villages. At this time, the Chinese mobile units had already penetrated deep into the Chaoshan railway line. On the evening of the 8th, Wang's troops attacked Huamei Station, engaging in hand-to-hand combat with the Japanese troops for thirty minutes, killing over thirty Japanese soldiers and burning a Japanese vehicle. Another unit attacked Shilong in Anbu, annihilating over forty Japanese and puppet troops. Thirteen Chinese soldiers heroically sacrificed their lives. After the 9th, the battles in Chao'an and Shantou became more intense. Chinese forces have already occupied all the strongholds on the Anjie road. The prospect of victory is very promising.

### Western Football Association Punishes Lido; Banned From Participating Next Season

The Western Football Association has abused its authority and applied high pressure to the Lido Football Team due to the charity match of Liu Fashang. In addition to punishing the two players Meng Yiliang and Jiang Zhaoxiang by suspending their participation in the entire 1940-1941 season, it also notified the football associations in Hong Kong and Tianjin that Meng and Jiang should not be allowed to participate in football matches in Tianjin and Hong Kong. At the same time, the Lido Sports Association was fined 50 yuan. If it is not paid, the qualifications for participating in the 1940-1941 league and Wei Cup will be cancelled. The intention of embarrassing Chinese teams and the prejudice against Chinese teams has become clear. The penalties, except for the suspension of Meng and Jiang, have been enforced early. The Lido association hopes that Lido will yield to pressure and obey, but it has never thought that such unreasonable measures of abusing power will be resented by all Chinese people. Lido is willing to sacrifice for charity, but for the sake of the integrity of the entire Chinese nation, it is also unwilling to be submissive. Therefore, the punishment notice from the Western association was ignored. The Western association, because the deadline for paying the fine has been exceeded, became angry and blatantly ignored the situation. It suddenly notified Lido the other day, saying, "The deadline for paying the fine has been exceeded, and the right of Lido to participate in the 1940-1941 competition has been cancelled. Even if the fine is paid in full, this penalty of cancelling the right to compete for one season must be enforced," and so on.

Although players such as Huang Tongyin, Zhang Yongru, Wang Guangmei, Fang Xiuwen, Zhu Shangxin, Hu Jiahe, Zhu Min, Xu Ruilan, He Jinxia, Tao Lanying, and Wang Mingxia have practiced for less than a year, their skill level is comparable to that of famous female players in Shanghai such as Liang Yujie, Lin Jinlan, Zhang Jiazhen, Cai Xiuyu, Xiao Weiqing, and Yan Wenjun. This is the biggest accomplishment of the YWCA's enthusiastic promotion. The third training class organized by the YWCA has concluded after three months of training. A general test for all students will be held at 4:00 PM today (the 21st) in the auditorium of the YWCA. Mr. Chen Linsheng, the instructor, will personally conduct the assessment.

### Finance: Foreign Exchange Selling Spree Unmatched

In the foreign exchange market yesterday, HSBC quoted higher for sterling, up 2.5, and lower for US dollars, down 0.3125. Other currencies also generally quoted higher. In the unofficial market, loose prices appeared frequently. The US dollar was about to break the 6 yuan mark. The European war stimulated people's minds, and it was widely believed to be unfavorable for the bullish side. At the beginning of the morning, speculators sold enthusiastically. The spot US dollar was quoted as high as 5.75 at its strongest. However, it was heard that the Stabilization Committee intervened at the 4.25 line, which hindered the weakening trend. Afterwards, the selling spree revived, and the US dollar actually reached 5.99375. Later, due to strong demand from foreign banks and rumors that the Stabilization Fund Committee had absorbed as much as 300,000 pounds sterling, and because speculators stopped selling and started buying before the close, prices rebounded. As a result, sterling was 4.23475, and the US dollar was 5.75, which was up 0.125 for sterling and down 0.21875 for the US dollar compared to last Saturday. The futures market was weakening.

US Dollar Nears 6 Yuan Mark

In the morning, exchange rates saw slight movements, with sterling rising 0.09375 against the US dollar and remaining unchanged against the French franc. The US dollar rose 0.01 against the British pound and 0.1 against the Shanghai currency, while the French franc rose 0.075. The central bank's quoted rates for various currencies remained the same. Banks opened the spot selling price in the morning with sterling at 4.03125 and the US dollar at 5.53125, compared to last Saturday's close, the US dollar was flat and sterling was slightly firmer by 0.015625 due to the rebound in exchange rates. After the opening, there was a strong selling spree, and there was a considerable lack of buyers. It is estimated that Chinese speculators aggressively sold the foreign banks 5-month US dollar futures at 5.5 to 6.25, and the market had indeed loosened. Moreover, the Bank of America and the Mercantile Bank had previously sold sterling to the Yokohama Specie Bank at 4.03125 for June delivery. HSBC's quoted prices were announced, with sterling up 0.25 and the US dollar down 0.3125. Other currencies also generally strengthened. The silver equalization tax was announced and remained unchanged. After that, Chinese speculators continued to sell without buying, relying only on HSBC and other banks to absorb the supply, but the situation remained firm overall. It is estimated that Chinese banks sold spot sterling to HSBC, quoting 4.23125, and speculators sold US dollars to foreign banks at 5.6875 and 5.75. The Yokohama Specie Bank sold to HSBC and Mercantile Bank at 5.6875 to 5.75. Therefore, the situation at the close appeared even firmer than before. Foreign banks and American banks were trading spot US dollars at a constant rate of 5.75. As a result, sterling closed at 4.21875 and the US dollar at 5.75. Sterling for this month was 4.1875 and the US dollar was 5.71875. Sterling for June was 4.03125 and the US dollar was 5.46875, which was up 0.1875 for sterling and down 0.21875 for the US dollar compared to the morning opening spot rates. Futures were generally firmer.

Stabilization Committee Rumored to be Absorbing

In the early afternoon, the market was even weaker than before. Speculators continued to sell, estimating that 5-month US dollar futures were sold to foreign banks at 5.75 and 5.8125. Foreign banks also traded spot US dollars at 5.8125. Subsequently, it was rumored that Qian Dui Ye sold US dollars to the China-Italy Bank at a low of 5.9375, but because foreign banks' appetite improved, speculators switched from selling to buying, estimating that they bought 5-month futures from foreign banks at 5.75 and 5.6875. It was also rumored that the Stabilization Fund Committee had absorbed a considerable amount of sterling at the 4.25 level. By the evening, foreign banks had buying without selling, so prices recovered. As a result, sterling was 4.234375, and the US dollar was 5.75. Sterling for this month was 4.21875, and the US dollar was 5.71875. Sterling for the next month was 4.0625, and the US dollar was 5.46875, which was up 0.125 for spot sterling and down 0.21875 for the US dollar compared to last Saturday's close. May and June futures were down 0.15625 for sterling and up 0.28125 for the US dollar.

### Gold Prices Plummet Unceasingly, Lowest Drop to 5,230 Yuan, Hong Kong Banks Suddenly Active Before Closing, Incline to Buy

Yesterday's spot gold in the unofficial market continued its downward spiral, plummeting to 5,230 yuan at one point, almost breaking through the 5,000 yuan mark. Fortunately, buying momentum returned at the end, closing at 5,500 yuan, but this was still a sharp drop of 365 yuan compared to the end of last week. In terms of buying and selling, the general feeling was that the drop was too drastic, and there were not many transactions. Generally, speculators had no appetite to enter, and there were only opportunistic trades. The market opened 165 yuan lower in the morning due to the setbacks of the Allied forces in the European war, which was unfavorable to the bullish side. The opening price was 5,700 yuan, followed by a further drop to 5,600 yuan due to the extreme weakness of foreign exchange and the vigorous selling by banks. Subsequently, rumors of a turnaround in the Allied military situation triggered buying, raising the price by more than 100 yuan. Ultimately, the above news soon dissipated. At that time, gold shops and banks entered the market to sell, and silver shops also sold a lot. Although some gold shops and securities firms intervened to absorb the supply, they were overwhelmed by the overwhelming selling pressure, causing the price to fall to 5,470 yuan. At noon, banks covered their short positions at 5,500 yuan as the closing price. In the afternoon, as the foreign exchange market became firmer, the price fell from the opening price of 5,420 yuan to a low of 5,230 yuan, the lowest price of the day, significantly affected by the massive selling by securities firms and the cheap selling by banks. However, the exchange market suddenly rebounded, and cash shops and silver shops all entered, and a certain silver shop and gold shop secretly searched for purchases on behalf of Hong Kong banks. Buying momentum suddenly rose, causing the closing price to jump to 5,500 yuan, a decrease of 365 yuan compared to the previous Saturday noon close. Trading throughout the day was quite brisk, with an estimated volume of more than 4,000 taels. Silver shop jewelry was quoted 30 yuan lower, and customs gold remained flat.

Spot Gold Falls 365 Yuan

From the morning, each tael (ten taels) initially dropped 165 yuan due to the weakness of the exchange market and reports of unfavorable news for the Allied forces in the European war, leading to widespread selling. The market opened with banks selling gold to gold shops at 5,700 yuan. Subsequently, due to the still firm exchange rate, silver shops sold to each other, and silver shops also sold, dropping another 100 yuan. Silver shops sold 20 taels to banks for 5,600 yuan. Later, news suddenly spread in the market of a turnaround in the European Allied forces war situation, and the weakening trend of the exchange market stabilized slightly, triggering buying, with gold shops and retail investors all buying in, resulting in a rebound of 120 yuan. Banks sold 10 taels to gold shops for 5,720 yuan. Ultimately, due to the sharp weakening of the exchange rate, a new round of selling began, with gold shops and banks selling even more. Soon, the price fell 240 yuan. Silver shops sold 50 taels to silver shops for 5,480 yuan. At that time, a certain gold shop saw the low price and bought aggressively, with a very large amount, estimated to be over 1,000 taels. The price then rebounded 120 yuan. Gold shops bought 20 taels from banks for 5,600 yuan. However, due to the renewed aggressive selling by the bank group, and the certain gold shop having stopped buying, the price fell sharply again by 130 yuan. Gold shops traded 30 taels with each other for 5,470 yuan. Near the close, gold shops came in to buy, and the price rebounded by 60 yuan. Banks bought 20 taels from securities firms for 5,530 yuan. However, due to the selling by securities firms, the noon close remained at only 5,500 yuan. In the afternoon, selling sentiment prevailed at the opening, dropping by 80 yuan. Securities firms sold 30 taels to banks for 5,420 yuan. Subsequently, relying on the slight buying by Qian Dui Ye and gold shops, the price rebounded by 30 yuan. Gold shops bought 10 taels from banks for 5,450 yuan. However, due to the weakness of the exchange market and the massive selling by securities firms and banks, the price plummeted by 220 yuan. Banks sold 10 taels to gold shops for 5,230 yuan. Later, with cash shops and silver shops buying in, and a certain gold shop and silver shop frequently searching for purchases on behalf of customer groups, and the exchange market also rebounding, sellers gradually decreased, leading to a rebound of 280 yuan. Gold shops sold 10 taels to Qian Dui Ye for 5,510 yuan. Then, gold shops bought 20 taels from silver shops for 5,500 yuan as the closing price, which was 365 yuan lower than last Saturday. After the close, the market continued to recover, with trades occurring at 5,560 yuan. The selling price of cash shops' own-brand gold was 10 yuan higher than the spot gold, and the buying price was 30 yuan lower. Spot standard gold was 50 yuan lower than the quoted gold, with few deals made.

Jewelry Revised Down to 570 Yuan

The selling price of jewelry per tael was initially still quoted at 600 yuan. Then, at 9:30 AM, it was revised down by 10 yuan. At 9:35 AM, it dropped another 10 yuan. At 10:05 AM, it continued to drop by 10 yuan. At 10:22 AM, it dropped another 10 yuan. At 10:27 AM, it rebounded by 10 yuan. In the afternoon, it dropped another 10 yuan at 2:00 PM. More than ten minutes later, it plummeted by 20 yuan. At 2:22 PM, it rebounded by 10 yuan. At 2:45 PM, it continued to rebound by 10 yuan. At 4:05 PM, it rebounded by 10 yuan again. As a result, it dropped by 30 yuan in total. It is estimated that the major companies revised their prices down to 570 yuan. New companies had the same price as the previous price, with the purchase price reduced by 30 yuan.

### Foreign Currency Declines Sharply, Slightly Recovers Towards Evening

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw gold-backed British and American pounds continue to plummet by as much as 7 yuan. The market price of sterling bills was very weak due to the continuous weakening of the black market sterling exchange rate, which led to continuous selling from all parties. The US dollar bill had already retreated to 16.95 yuan in the morning, and further news about Paris in the afternoon caused it to fall to 16.5 yuan. By around 4:00 PM, news that the Hong Kong Stabilization Committee suddenly inclined to buy foreign exchange made people feel at ease, and the evening market rose to 17.3 yuan, but it was still 0.45 yuan lower than last Saturday. Hong Kong bills fell sharply by 0.18 yuan along with the sharp drop in the Hong Kong-Shanghai exchange rate. In addition, bills such as French francs, Singapore dollars, rupees, Canadian dollars, and Philippine pesos were all weak. The supply of Japanese yen was also smooth, and the evening market retreated to 1.11 yuan. The supply and demand for Korean won was still balanced, and the evening market remained at 0.92 yuan.

### Exchange Bills and Discount Rates Stable

Yesterday's exchange bill and discount rates were quite stable, consistently ranging from 120 yuan to 115 yuan per 1,000 yuan throughout the day, similar to last Saturday's price. The Qian Cai Gong Hui's overnight rate was raised by 0.03 in both the morning and afternoon markets, reaching 0.24 yuan.

### Yarn and Cotton: More Floating Losses Liquidated, Yarn Market Active, Double Horse Drops Another 75 Yuan

The yarn market continued to decline, and the decline intensified sharply. This was because the European war was increasingly entangled, causing American and Indian cotton to plummet. As a result, people were panic-stricken, and speculators were anxious, liquidating floating losses with pain, causing market volatility. However, Hong Kong banks had a strong need for 20-count Double Horse and 10-count coarse yarn, which slightly saved the downward trend.

The morning opening of the current yarn market was as chaotic as hemp, with inconsistent shouting prices. The spot price of 20-count Double Horse was 1,305 yuan. A short while later, news of foreign exchange strengthening and gold falling led to immediate heavy selling, dropping straight to 1,200 yuan. Later, it was heard that Guangzhou banks had business for Double Horse, and the price rebounded by several tens of yuan. The half-day transaction statistics totaled 2,870 bales. The market price of 20-count Double Horse fell by 75 yuan. The breakdown of the amount purchased by various banks is listed as follows:

Counterparts 705 Ningbo 165

Hong Kong 2,000 Statistics 2,870

### Foreign Cotton Falls Frequently, Local Cotton Transactions Halted

Local cotton transactions completely came to a halt. This was because the European war was expanding, and American and Indian cotton were falling frequently. At the same time, the yarn market was sluggish, causing widespread panic. Everyone was standing by and watching.

Another report is that in the foreign cotton market, the New York cotton market initially fell by more than 40 British pounds due to the Liverpool and Mumbai banks selling a massive 40,000 bales in the market. The cotton price then stabilized slightly. As a result, the closing market price fell by 30 British pounds compared to the previous day. The Indian market was quite weak, with the closing price falling by more than 20 rupees. Predictions for a rebound resulted in a drop of 6 rupees compared to the previous day.

Shanghai foreign cotton transactions have been quiet in recent days due to the low overseas market prices and the complexity of the European situation, with all parties tentatively planning to take a wait-and-see approach. However, it is generally predicted that Indian cotton will sign an agreement with Japan to exchange cotton for yarn, so Indian cotton is expected to rise. The following are the futures prices of US cotton delivered to the factory yesterday, converted at an exchange rate of 5.5 yuan per US dollar:

20 Count American Middling 315.70

Also Lower Grade 315.50

32 Count Ditto 340.20

Also Lower Grade 340.10

42 Count Ditto 352.90

Also Lower Grade 342.50

Indian cotton is continuously arriving today and tomorrow. It is reported that the British company's "Pertavan" (transliteration) postal ship arrived in Shanghai today, carrying 1,750 pieces of cotton from Mumbai, and will dock at the Qichang Wharf in Pudong for unloading. Also, the Italian ship "Kantirachai" (transliteration) will arrive in Shanghai tomorrow, carrying 1,345 tons of cotton from Calcutta, and will dock at the Gonghexing Wharf in Hongkou for unloading.

### Securities: Foreign Stocks Difficult to Curb Decline, Domestic Bonds Still Strong

The securities trading situation yesterday was that as foreign exchange rates rose and gold prices fell, people's hearts gradually stabilized, and both short covering and new long positions rose in the market for public bonds. Class A bonds rose to 60 yuan, and Class C and E bonds also rose to 50 yuan. The market atmosphere was very good. The current situation is mostly favorable for long positions and short covering, but unfortunately the money supply is too tight, and the bullish side is ultimately constrained and cannot fully develop its strengths. Trading was sluggish in the morning and increased sharply in the afternoon. Lianhe searched for purchases very strongly. Hongda and Defu also had considerable intake. Jiufeng, Yichang, and Tiansheng also had interest in short covering and taking long positions. Hongkang consistently sold, and Tongshun and Xieda also sold at high prices. The market buying sentiment was very strong, and retail investors also bought more and sold less, and the trend clearly had a pattern of circling upwards. As a result, all bonds rose by 0.6 to 0.7 yuan. The total number of transactions was estimated to be around 1.3 million yuan. A brief table is listed below:

Category Highest Lowest Closing Compared to Previous Day

Unified A 60.50 59.90 60.50 Up 0.60

Unified B 52.35 51.80 52.30 Up 0.70

Unified C 50.45 49.65 50.35 Up 0.75

Unified D 48.95 48.20 48.95 Up 0.70

Unified E 50.85 49.80 50.80 Up 0.75

In stock trading, 30 shares of Dasheng No. 1 Factory stock were traded at a price of 16.75 yuan.

Although the New York stock market on Saturday stabilized amid a major decline, the Shanghai stock market opened with a feeling of unease. This is undoubtedly due to the general public's doubts about the future outcome of the large-scale war currently taking place in northern France. However, war is a long-term struggle, so even if there are small setbacks at times, they can only be regarded as temporary reversals and have no fundamental or decisive significance. The biggest reason for the market's weakness is that there was a slight disappointment with news related to the war, and secondly, there was a lack of maintenance ability from the buying side. The prices of various stocks fell sharply yesterday. There was a sign of rebound in the first half hour of the morning, but unfortunately rumors flourished in the afternoon, causing the price to drop again. In order to avoid all sorts of trouble, according to the custom of the London market, after the company has announced dividend distribution, stock bonuses, or other new stocks, all transactions will be traded at a price excluding dividends, rights, or stock bonuses in the same week when the transfer is stopped.

### Three Kinds of Rubber Stocks Distribute Dividends

The intermediaries of Shengjia De Li, Boheng, and Ketaba Road, three rubber tree companies managed by the British firm Xiangmao Foreign Company, have all announced the regular distribution of interim dividends for the fiscal year ending at the end of June 1940. Shengjia De Li will distribute 3 yuan per share of national currency, and Boheng will distribute 0.3 yuan per share of national currency, both scheduled for distribution starting on June 4th. Ketaba Road will also distribute 0.3 yuan per share of national currency, scheduled for distribution starting on June 12th.

### Food: Hot Weather Makes Rice易 Deteriorate, Sales Fall in Succession

The rice market still presents a weak color, and the entire city has been consistently sluggish from beginning to end. The early market at the beginning was difficult to grasp due to the one-day closure yesterday, so both buyers and sellers were holding back. There was only slight activity until the middle market, and then news of gold falling and exchange rates rising, as well as the yarn and cotton markets all trending lower, made people even more nervous. The general public was eager to exit the market, and the changes in the market were dramatic. General speculators were also wary of the crisis lurking in the market and did not dare to make a move. Instead, they remained hidden. The whole city's sales area only had scattered spot sales, resulting in few deals and prices only fluctuating by half a yuan.

洋米 was affected by the falling gold and exchange rates. The opening price in the morning gradually trended lower, and the selling pressure was even stronger in the afternoon. Those with floating stockpiles competed to sell first, followed by large households. The downward trend became even stronger. The opening price for Xiaojiao rice in the morning was still 47 yuan, and the noon market closed at 46.4 yuan. The afternoon was shaken by the gold market, once plummeting to 44.5 yuan. The closing market stabilized slightly, and as a result, returned to 45 yuan, a drop of more than 2.5 yuan compared to the closing price last weekend. The noon closing price for other types of rice also decreased by a few cents to a yuan, while the afternoon continued to decrease by one yuan and one and a half yuan. The original package of No. 2 Saigon rice from Yinghua Si dropped 56.4 yuan, also decreasing by 2-3 yuan.

Also, after the local rice in this city was blocked from shipping to Shanghai, the source of supply was cut off, and the price of rice soared accordingly. The foreign rice took the opportunity to become active, and the merchants managing it placed orders with Vietnam and Siam. The number of foreign rice imports has been astonishing in the past two months, and warehouses have even been filled to capacity. In the past two weeks, the import of foreign rice has gradually decreased. The price of foreign rice used to be cheaper than local rice, but now it is equal to or even higher than the price of local rice. This situation is worrisome for civilian livelihoods, and it is hoped that the rice industry will find a way to suppress it and maintain the people's livelihood. It is reported that the Yihua Foreign Company's Taisheng ship shipped 4,461 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong yesterday, docking at the Roosevelt Wharf for unloading. (Zu)

Thick and thin粳 local rice sources continue to be strong, with an estimated arrival of over 3,000 bags, of which Du粳 accounts for two-thirds. As a result, there are rumors that the off-market prices are even cheaper, and the weather is hot and stuffy, people are even more unsettled and are selling at low prices to unload. The making price for open粳 rice has fallen one yuan. Wuxi 清粳 rice is 49 yuan, 纷粳 is 48 yuan, and Changkun粳 is 47 yuan. However, the arrival of thin rice and early rice is relatively rare, depreciating slightly by 3-5 cents. Qing Si special thin is 50 yuan, large market is 48-9 yuan, Nangang early rice special is 47-8 yuan, Jue is 46 yuan, and so on.

Although glutinous rice is a seasonal commodity, the arrival volume is also strong, and it is affected by the off-market 粳 rice, sales are sluggish and prices have dropped one yuan. The opening price of Jinli special is 43.5-43 yuan, Changdan Bai is 42.5 yuan, and the second-best is 40 yuan.

### Flour Mills Reduce Price by Two Cents

The flour market is sluggish, the transactions on this street are always quiet, and there is no hope for enthusiastic sales to customers. In addition, with the sharp drop in gold prices and the decline in various commodity prices, people's hearts are weak, which is clearly evident. Therefore, the price for No. 2 flour mills has also been reduced to 13.8 yuan, a decrease of 0.2 yuan compared to last week. The price for the old brand of returned flour was opened at 13.85 yuan in the morning, but no one accepted it in the afternoon. Other domestic miscellaneous brands of flour have also been reduced by 0.1 to 0.2 yuan. Transactions for the entire market are estimated to be around 5,000 bags, and the outlook for the market is not optimistic.

### Oil Cakes: Bean Oil Retreats Rapidly, Bean Cakes Remain Supported

Bean oil is still sluggish, and the market was volatile and chaotic throughout the day. As a result, selling sentiment prevailed, and the market price continued to fall by 4-5 yuan. It is estimated that 300 barrels of Dalian bean oil were opened, and the price fell from 96 yuan to 92 yuan. 50 pieces of Yanqi bean oil were 68 yuan, 90 dan of Dayou factory oil were 69 yuan, and 50 barrels of Runfeng factory oil were 70 yuan. The sales of bean cakes are now on the rise, but they are constrained by the environment, and there is a lack of excitement. In recent days, the Southern China gangs have been watching, but the inland area still has inquiries, so the overall situation can be supported. Yesterday, it is estimated that 3,000 pieces of Dayou Factory Four Brand cakes were sold, with prices ranging from 10.065 yuan to 10.09 yuan, 2,500 pieces of Tongsheng Factory Shenji cakes were sold at 10 yuan to 10.015 yuan, and 500 pieces of Yantai cakes were sold at 10.05 yuan.

### Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth Market Sentiment Fluctuates; Northern Merchants Aggressively Purchase Eastern Textiles in the Afternoon

The cloth market opened lower this morning, rebounding slightly in the afternoon. This was likely due to the continued easing of exchange rates, leading to wavering market sentiment. Stockpilers continued to unload their goods, while buyers remained cautious. Later in the day, northern merchants aggressively bought up Eastern textiles (fine cloth), bolstering confidence. Throughout the day, transactions were sporadic. In this street, approximately one hundred and several dozen pieces were traded. Merchants from Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Guangdong traded nearly a hundred pieces of dyed cloth and coarse cloth, with varying prices. Fine twill cloth fell by about one yuan per piece, while coarse cloth remained stable. Prices for dyed and bleached cloth from various factories also mostly declined. Lun Chang's "Hero" blue cloth was newly priced at sixty-two yuan per piece, a decrease of ten yuan from the original price.

For Eastern-produced white cloth, the leading brand of fine cloth fell from forty-one yuan to thirty-nine yuan at the morning session closing. Market sentiment was weak at the opening of the afternoon session, intensifying the selling pressure. The lowest price plummeted to thirty-seven yuan and two jiao and a half per piece. "Four Gentlemen" serge fell to one yuan, six fen, and a half per yard. Around four o'clock, merchants from Tianjin, Qinhuangdao, and other northern regions suddenly came in strong to buy spot fine cloth, with six to seven hundred pieces changing hands. Local traders also seized the opportunity to buy, causing the market sentiment to shift. The closing price for the leading brand rose to forty yuan and five jiao, and serge to approximately one yuan, one jiao, and three fen. Today (the 21st), the market issued a notice that due to the hot weather, business will be suspended in the afternoon, with only half-day operations.

### Silk and Tea: Hangzhou-Jiaxing Cocoon Market Opens; Wuxi Silkworm Season Looking Good

The cocoon market in the Hangzhou-Jiaxing area of Zhejiang has already opened, but the supply is limited. Local variety cocoons opened at one hundred and eighty yuan, and Duyang variety cocoons at two hundred and fifty yuan. Based on cost calculations, and due to the high price of fuel and other expenses, new factory silk should be priced above four thousand two hundred yuan per dan. This spring, many silkworm farmers are reeling silk themselves, based on the experience of previous years, as selling cocoons is not very profitable. Currently, white raw silk is priced at one hundred and sixty yuan per hundred taels. Calculated at one thousand six hundred taels, the cost of each dan of Chihli-style white raw silk should be around two thousand six hundred yuan. In general, the cost of silk is very high this year, while the confidence in the overseas market is very uncertain.

In the rural areas of Wuxi, silkworm farming is progressing smoothly. The early batch has already completed its first major molt and started feeding for two days, while the late batch has completed its third molt and started feeding. The price of leaves has recently been eleven to twelve yuan per dan. There has not yet been a significant shortage of mulberry leaves. (Good)

### Japanese Silk Dumps; Local European Sales Quiet; Jardine's Already Unloading New Silk

Yokohama spot price: 1,530 yuan, down 10 yuan. Near-term: 1,540 yuan, down 30 yuan. Far-term: 1,555 yuan, down 25 yuan.

In the local silk market, Jardine Matheson has already started selling new silk, approximately thirty bales of White Factory silk, graded at 7-8, priced at five thousand and fifty yuan. Transactions of old silk are not frequently seen. Chihli brand is priced at two thousand six hundred yuan, with Da Chang and others purchasing twenty dan. Sales to Europe appear weak in comparison.

### Sugar Market: Raw White Sugar Softens

According to a Dutch telegram yesterday, raw white sugar was quoted at US$4.80 per picul, making it increasingly affordable. Coupled with the rise in exchange rates, the market softened. The association's quoted price for spot #24 raw white sugar from foreign warehouses was initially seventy to sixty-nine yuan, then sixty-nine and a half to sixty-nine yuan, down two and a half yuan. Re-export goods were fifty-five yuan, down approximately three yuan. Taikoo Granulated sugar's price decrease was less pronounced; B-mark fell more, to eighty-three yuan. Although domestic sugar merchants tried to maintain their prices, with foreign sugar prices plummeting, they could not maintain their advantage and also appeared quiet.

### Northern and Southern Goods: Southern Goods Scarce

Southern gorgon nuts are no longer being delivered, and market stocks are almost depleted. As a result, those with any stock are demanding a high price of three hundred yuan. Pond gorgon nuts remain stable, with cleaned goods at eighty yuan and ordinary at seventy-five yuan. It is said that the retail price of Southern gorgon nuts in stores is no less than three yuan.

### Seafood: Sago and Pepper Both See Market Slumps

Recently, the foreign exchange rate has eased, causing a decline in prices for all imported goods. Currently, both small and large grain sago are selling for ninety yuan, a decrease of ten yuan from before. Black peppercorns are at one hundred and twenty-five yuan, white pepper #1 at two hundred and ten yuan, #2 at one hundred and ninety yuan, and #3 at one hundred and sixty yuan, also down twenty to thirty yuan, with some transactions occurring.

### Metals: "Association Iron" Relies Only on Factory Sales

Genuine Straits tinplate is currently very scarce, and the quoted prices are extremely firm and expensive. Therefore, most factories are inquiring about "Association Iron" as it is more affordable compared to tinplate. Checks on alternative routes for this product reveal that merchants from North and South China are the primary buyers. However, it is said that demand from these groups has been very low recently, resulting in sluggish sales. As a result, the only outlet for "Association Iron" at the moment is small, local factories.

### Earnest Advice from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce: All Shops Should Suppress Prices, Encouraging Each Other to Sell More at Low Profit and Set Fair Prices; The Two Concessions Are Determined to Suppress Speculation

Yesterday, the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce issued a letter to the city's business community regarding the issue of prices, stating, "To all members of the city's business community, during the recent six months, the price of goods has risen beyond normal levels, and the people's livelihood is suffering like never before. At this difficult time, even if we cannot share everything we have with each other or sympathize with each other's difficulties, how can we bear to be the only ones full while others are starving, or to take advantage of the danger for profit? We dare to offer our humble sincerity and do our best to provide loyal advice. The only reason cited for the recent high prices is the rise in the exchange rate between foreign currency and the national currency. It must be understood that the daily needs of the people are mostly produced in China. The fluctuations in the exchange rate do not completely affect the level of costs. Merchants seeking profit should calculate the cost of each item based on the cost of production in its place of origin, the expenses along the way, and the operating expenses of the store, and then set their profit margins.

Prices Follow the Exchange Rate in Reverse

Today, for all goods, regardless of whether they are produced domestically or not, almost all prices fluctuate with gold and foreign exchange. This approach is close to acting in reverse. Furthermore, high exchange rates can only affect goods purchased from abroad that have not yet been priced. Retail stores that have already purchased and have not yet sold out their inventory are not affected at all. Yet, upon hearing news of rising exchange rates in the morning, they immediately raise prices in the evening, echoing the trend. What is their intention? Moreover, when the exchange rate rises, the price of goods rises accordingly, but when the exchange rate falls, the price of goods does not fall accordingly. Some prices, once raised, often increase by several times, while price reductions are extremely small, barely enough to serve as a disguise to avoid criticism. All of these behaviors are heartbreaking.

What Comes Illegitimately Goes Illegitimately: An Ancient Admonition

The nation is facing unprecedented difficulties, and the people are suffering unprecedented displacement. If we take advantage of the opportunity to exploit the flesh and blood of our compatriots to enrich ourselves, how can we be considered among the civilized and descendants of gods? Our association believes that what comes illegitimately goes illegitimately, as the ancient saying goes. Selling more at low profit is the most important principle of doing business. The pricing of daily necessities for the people must be fair. For goods not from abroad, do not use the exchange rate as an excuse. At this time of inconvenient transportation and delayed deliveries, we should carefully observe the needs of supply and demand, and sell as we receive, without hoarding large quantities or refusing to sell. Do not artificially create a fear of shortages with your policies, thinking that great profits are within reach. It must be understood that the current situation in this city, where the people's lives are generally difficult, has aroused the deep concern of the concession authorities. Those who boast that they can take advantage of this ungoverned situation to do as they please will eventually face the ancient saying "invite the ruler into the urn." It is not too late to repent now. We sincerely advise you, and hope you will understand."

The Public Concession's Intentions Are Firm

The Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession, after the sharp fluctuations in the black market exchange rate several weeks ago, noted that prices in this city had once risen sharply. Now, the exchange rate has eased, and the price of legal tender has rebounded, reaching levels comparable to those before the sharp fluctuations. However, merchants in this city are not seeking to reduce prices, and some stores even show a tendency to continue raising prices. On the 18th, the council sent letters to related commercial organizations, ordering stores to reduce prices. If they continue to charge excessive prices and attempt to undermine the council's measures to improve social living conditions, it will have no choice but to strictly enforce regulations. According to inquiries from reporters at the Dazhong News Agency, unless prices are announced to be falling and the spirit of speculation no longer exists in the market, the concession authorities will take strong and forceful steps.

The Two Concessions Take the Same Steps

The Public Concession Municipal Council is currently studying recent prices and preparing to take legal action against merchants in the city in the near future. It is also learned that the council is working closely with the French Concession Municipal Council, taking the same steps to ensure that these measures are effective. As for the rumors that the French Concession authorities hope that the Public Concession authorities will cooperate in controlling prices and cracking down on speculation, in reality, the Public Concession and French Concession authorities are already cooperating more effectively than before under the most effective conditions. With mutual assistance and cooperation, controlling prices and cracking down on speculation is not just a hope.

A Serious Lesson for Hoarders

Never before have Chinese merchants in this city engaged in speculation as enthusiastically as they do today. They not only buy foreign exchange and foreign stocks, but also hoard American goods. Unexpectedly, the prices of American goods and stocks have continued to plummet, while the exchange rate has risen sharply, adding insult to injury, resulting in multiple losses. Therefore, the magnitude of the losses is unprecedented in Shanghai's history. According to reliable estimates, as of yesterday afternoon, the total losses of major speculative Chinese merchants alone, when converted to legal tender, amounted to over 100 million yuan. Of this, losses in American goods and stocks were over 50 million yuan, and losses in foreign exchange were around 50 million yuan. This does not include other small speculators and those hoarding non-American goods, or those buying non-American stocks.

Speculative Tricks Exhausted; Coal Prices Continue to Fall

In the local coal market, as the price of gold rebounded, speculators were unable to use their tricks. Hoarders rushed to sell, and now is also the slack season for the coal market, with sluggish sales, causing coal prices to continue to fall. Yesterday, the price of coal dust fell by four yuan per ton from one hundred and fifty-two yuan, to one hundred and forty-eight yuan per ton. The price of coal balls also fell by six yuan per ton, from one hundred and forty yuan to one hundred and thirty-four yuan. However, the prices charged by various coal ball retail stores are quite inconsistent, which is contrary to the authorities' fair pricing rules. It is hoped that the retail stores will correct this, voluntarily suppressing prices.

### Gold Plummets Again, Black Market Exchange Rates Continue to Ease, Domestic Bonds Soar, Rising by Seventy to Eighty Cents Yesterday

Yesterday, the financial market situation in the local black market saw a significant drop in gold prices, once falling to 5,220 yuan, a sharp decline of 645 yuan compared to the closing price last Saturday. However, the closing price was 5,530 yuan, still a decrease of 335 yuan. As for black market exchange rates, they also showed a sharp easing. The spot British pound closed at 4 pence 234375 yesterday, and the spot US dollar also rose to 5.78125 yuan. The black market exchange rate had tightened sharply at the beginning of this month, but after days of easing, the difference is now negligible. Gold prices have also fallen back, exceeding the market price before the rise at the beginning of the month. Therefore, the market prices of all items should fall back accordingly, but due to the profiteering of retail stores, consumers have not yet benefited from it, but this will not last long. In short, the sharp drop in gold and the easing of black market exchange rates undoubtedly strengthened the value of the legal tender. Therefore, domestic bonds soared yesterday, with various unified bonds rising by seventy to eighty cents, while foreign stocks continued to decline.

Reasons for the Easing of Black Market Exchange Rates

The reasons for the sharp drop in gold prices and the easing of black market exchange rates are: (1) In the Sino-Japanese War, the Chinese side has won consecutive victories, and not only is there absolute confidence in the final victory, but the situation for achieving the final victory has been completed. (2) The Japanese side needs legal tender to purchase agricultural products in the occupied areas, and a large amount of black market exchange is also being sold off. (3) Foreign exchange from Southeast Asia, such as the Dutch East Indies, Singapore, and South China, Hong Kong, is flowing into Shanghai in large quantities, fearing control by the authorities. (4) Serious news about the European war is stimulating people to sell. (5) Depositors in Shanghai banks of various countries involved in the European war, as well as banks of a certain European country rumored to be about to join the war, are withdrawing their deposits, and they have to sell off black market exchange to exchange for legal tender to cope with the situation.

National Bond Prices Rise Steadily

Since the frequent victories of the Chinese army in Hubei and Henan, and the Ministry of Finance has paid the principal and interest of the unified public bonds due through the four banks of the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank, confirming that the rumors of suspension of principal and interest payments are false. As a result, the buying interest in national bonds is strong, and prices are rising steadily. Yesterday, the unofficial market closing prices of various unified bonds were: Type A, 60.15 yuan in the morning and 60.50 yuan in the afternoon; Type B, 51.80 yuan in the morning and 52.30 yuan in the afternoon; Type C, 49.80 yuan in the morning and 50.35 yuan in the afternoon; Type D, 48.20 yuan in the morning and 48.95 yuan in the afternoon; Type E, 50.10 yuan in the morning and 50.80 yuan in the afternoon.

Parcel Service to Funing and Other Places Resumes

The post office announced that personal and small parcels and medicine parcels to Funing, Dianhu, Beisha, Yangzhai Town, Goudun Town, and Yukou Town in Jiangsu Province can now be resumed.

### No Withdrawal of British and French Troops, Shanghai Situation Unchanged, European and Asian Transportation May Be Slightly Affected, But Foreign Trade Will Not Be Interrupted

According to a certain important French figure yesterday, there will be an important turning point in the European situation, but the content cannot be disclosed due to military secrets. Currently, four French veterans, Pétain, Weygand, Gamelin, and Giraud, are involved in military affairs, and the situation should unfold in a week. As for the situation in Shanghai, there is no change, and there is no plan to withdraw any of the British and French troops stationed in Shanghai. French merchant ships are still passing through the Mediterranean as usual, and unless there are special changes, there is no need to change the route. British ships are now detouring around the Cape of Good Hope. The connection between Europe and Asia will inevitably be slightly affected, but it will definitely not be as serious as generally imagined, because the time from the Far East to the United Kingdom via the Mediterranean is 30 days, and detouring around the Cape of Good Hope is only 38 days.

The Gloom in Shanghai is Gradually Clearing

According to a certain British diplomatic source, the recent tension in Shanghai's atmosphere is obviously affected by the expansion of the European war, but it cannot be regarded as a sign of the deterioration of relations between the authorities of various countries in Shanghai. At the beginning of the expansion of the European war, the authorities of the countries concerned had many concerns about whether the situation in Shanghai would change. However, since Admiral Hord, commander of the Asian Fleet, invited the commanders of the defense forces of various countries in China to meet and concluded a certain agreement, the gloom of the deterioration of the situation in Shanghai has gradually cleared, and the future of Shanghai can maintain the status quo.

Sino-Dutch Trade Has Not Been Interrupted

According to a spokesperson for the Dutch Consulate in Shanghai, the Netherlands has been invaded in this European war. The German army concentrated all its forces, used a large number of mechanized units, and had thousands of aircraft to coordinate the attack. The Netherlands has a small land area and a dense population. In order to protect tens of millions of lives and avoid being涂炭, the Dutch commander-in-chief painfully ordered a ceasefire. However, this does not mean complete surrender. There are still a large number of Dutch troops fighting side by side with the Allied forces in France to strive for the final victory, recover the lost land, and regain peace and freedom. There are more than 300 Dutch citizens in Shanghai, all engaged in business. There are only two or three Dutch citizens in the interior of China. Sino-Dutch relations have always been very harmonious, and trade is very developed. Now that the European route of Dutch ships has been suspended, Dutch goods cannot come to Shanghai. However, the Dutch East Indies route is maintained as usual, so trade between the two sides has not been interrupted.

Shanghai-Europe Telegrams are as Numerous as Snowflakes

Since the expansion of the European war, various radio companies have been very busy. It is found that there are currently several wireless telegraph operators in Shanghai, including the British-owned Great Eastern Telegraph Company, the Danish-owned Great Northern Telegraph Company, the American-owned Pacific Commercial Telegraph Company, and the International Wireless Radio Station, which was formerly managed by the Ministry of Communications but is now occupied by the Japanese. Each company receives and sends about eighty telegrams every day, more than thirty telegrams from Berlin, and about forty and thirty telegrams sent to Rome and Berlin, respectively, an increase of five or six times compared to before. This shows the busyness of Shanghai's wireless telegrams to Europe. As for wireless telegrams to the United States, San Francisco is the main destination. Each company sends a total of 150 to 200 telegrams every day, and receives 70 to 80 telegrams.

### US Overseas Trade Week Day Three, Grand Luncheon Held, Secretary of State Hull Broadcast Last Night, Navy Chaplain of the Asian Fleet Speaks

US Overseas Trade Week began the day before yesterday (the 19th). All American merchants in Shanghai held a special worship service at the Great Light Theater at 10:00 am that day, and Navy Chaplain Dunster of the US Asian Fleet delivered a speech. It is learned that US Secretary of State Hull gave a broadcast speech last night to commemorate the festival, which was rebroadcast to the world by the Treasure Island Radio Station in San Francisco, call sign XGHI, at 10:45 pm last night. Those with shortwave radios in Shanghai can listen to it. The American Chamber of Commerce and the American Association will hold a grand luncheon at the American Club this noon to celebrate.

Dunster's Speech

Navy Chaplain Dunster of the US Asian Fleet gave a speech at the special worship service held by the US Navy for Overseas Trade Week the day before yesterday, stating that all countries in the world should currently devote themselves to a great cause, that is, how to maintain permanent peace in the world. The ultimate goal of all mankind is peace, although this theory seems impossible to realize at present, but we should carefully examine the various conventions and organizations established in history, such as the League of Nations, etc., whose purpose is to make countries have closer relations,

Mutual Assistance and Understanding

and faith. Taking the United States as an example, there are a total of forty-eight states, but they can all unite and be controlled by Washington. The so-called states all have their individual characteristics, but the entire United States still has a common goal and cooperation. Therefore, taking the United States as a symbol, the forty-eight states unite to seek common interests and happiness. The above-mentioned ideal of world peace is by no means completely impossible. If we take the happiness of the whole world as a prerequisite, every country should treat its neighbors with a broader vision, and should abolish racial concepts and believe that every nation should be above another nation. The call of humanitarianism should be the foundation of human life. If we want to maintain the happiness of the world, we must remember what we do not want others to do to us, which is

Golden Rule

The current stage of the war will hardly improve the current situation, but we can adhere to the principle of "do not do to others what you do not want them to do to you." This is especially important in the current situation in Shanghai, because Shanghai is the only international city in the world. The residents of Shanghai include nationals of forty-five different countries. We live in the same place every day, and we should abandon racial prejudice. We must first have this kind of loyalty and treat others with kindness before we can get others to treat us with kindness. To expand it, we must make all mankind become brothers and sisters, and live together under the rule of this golden rule.

Today's Grand Gathering

Also, the US Overseas Trade Week luncheon will be held at the Shanghai Union Club at 12:00 noon today. At that time, US Consul Smith will give a speech. Also, at 12:30 pm on the 23rd, the Rotary Club will hold a luncheon at the Capital Hotel to commemorate Overseas Trade Week. At that time, French Embassy Commercial Counselor セレン司, Canadian Government Commercial Commissioner De 克洛氏, US Consul Smith, etc., will all give speeches on US Trade Week.

### Nanjing Special Party Headquarters Telegraphs Congratulations for the Victory in Hubei and Henan

The Nanjing Special City Party Headquarters, because of the recent battles in Hubei and Henan, annihilated tens of thousands of enemies, so they telegraphed President Chiang to pay their respects. The original text is as follows: President Chiang, In the Hubei-Henan battles, tens of thousands of enemies were annihilated, and it is hoped that they will be utterly defeated. The courage of the Japanese soldiers has been shattered, and their virtue has been spread frequently. The belief in victory is becoming stronger. Hearing the good news from afar, I admire your great achievements. I hereby telegraph congratulations and pay my respects. The Nanjing Special City Party Headquarters bowed, 巧.

### Ship Schedules of Various Countries Arriving in Shanghai are Temporarily Changed, Regular Mail Ships Cannot Arrive on Time, American Ships are Crowded with Cargo, Import and Export Departures are Behind Schedule

The expansion of the European war has had a significant impact on the shipping industry. Within the European-Asian route, German and Danish merchant ships have completely suspended operations. Norwegian and Dutch ships are operating under the command of the British Navy. Although Italian ships are not related, they are mostly requisitioned for national defense needs, so the number of ships operating on the Far East route has also decreased. As the United Kingdom and France are belligerent countries, the operation of each ship is particularly cautious and strictly confidential. Regular mail ships cannot arrive on time, and irregular ships are even more inaccurate.

British and French Ships

It is heard that the British ship 巴特凡号 will arrive in Shanghai from London today. A certain French mail ship set sail from Marseille in late last month and is expected to arrive in Shanghai at the end of this month. Another French ship was originally scheduled to set off for China last week, but the city has not yet received a telegram from the ship. Since the outbreak of the European war, the transportation of American ships has suddenly become prosperous. Due to the loading and unloading of cargo, the departure schedules of American President Lines mail ships are often delayed.

American Ship Routes

The passenger ship 搭虎脱 President号 was originally scheduled to come to Shanghai from Little Luzon via Hong Kong tomorrow and return to the United States. It is heard that it will be delayed by one day and will arrive in Shanghai on the 23rd. The company's world-class mail ship 泡克号, which departed from New York, came to China via Japan, and went to Hong Kong and Southeast Asian ports, returning to the United States via Europe, traveling around the world, was originally scheduled to arrive in port tomorrow, but it is now heard that it will arrive early at 2:00 pm today, anchoring at the 11th and 12th net cylinders. The passenger shuttle will depart from the Customs Pier at 2:15 pm today and return to the Customs Pier to land passengers at about 3:45 pm. The 泡克 President号 mail ship is scheduled to leave Shanghai at 8:45 pm tomorrow and go to Hong Kong and Little Luzon. The last shuttle to send passengers will depart from the Customs Pier at 7:15 pm tomorrow.

Java Mail Ship

The Java Company mail ship 芝尼加拿号 should have arrived in Shanghai yesterday according to the scheduled schedule, but due to the German attack on the Netherlands, the ship was ordered to stop in the Philippines, and then it resumed sailing, causing a delay of one day. The exact time of arrival in port today has not yet been announced by the company yesterday. The ship is scheduled to dock at the Puxi blue smoke chimney pier.

### Charity Arts and Crafts Fair Closes Tonight, Yi Fangshuo and Zhang Yezhi Perform Together in an Unprecedented Breakthrough

The Shanghai Relief of Refugee Children's Education Center, in order to raise funds for expanding production education, specifically organized the "Shanghai Jishan Arts and Crafts Fair" for the 29th year, which has been held at the Gengxin Stage on Niuzhuang Road since its opening on the 14th of this month. Every day, wonderful programs are performed, and enthusiastic people from all walks of life have generously donated and enthusiastically purchased tickets to help the refugees, creating an unprecedented grand occasion. The meeting, in order to thank the enthusiastic people from all walks of life for their kindness, agreed with the person in charge of the Gengxin Stage and continued to perform for two days yesterday and today. Mr. Yuan Ludeng, a social celebrity, obtained the consent of two drama masters, Yi Fangshuo and Zhang Yezhi, to perform together in an unprecedented way. Yesterday, all of "Four Teaching Songs" was sung by Yi Zhang himself, which was quite wonderful, and the audience returned with great pleasure. Today's programs include "Catch and Release Cao", "A Dragon and Phoenix Present Auspiciousness", and "Chain Set". The meeting decided to close at 6:00 pm today.

### Water Company Continues to Provide Free Clean Water

The Shanghai Water Company, at the request of the Public Works Bureau's Sanitation Department, will continue to provide free tap water to civilians from several taps on the road this year to prevent cholera and emphasize hygiene.

### Another Batch of Japanese Troops Return Silently

Recently, the Japanese army was defeated once in northern Jiangxi and again in northern Hubei. The number of casualties is shocking. The corpses that have been retrieved are being transported to Shanghai for cremation and placed in boxes, ready to be transported back to Japan in batches for a silent reunion with their relatives and friends. Yesterday was the date for the 42nd memorial service for ashes held by the Japanese in Shanghai. Important Japanese military and political figures and overseas Chinese leaders stationed in Shanghai paid their respects at "Xiben願寺" at 5:00 pm, and a music team played mourning songs. It is scheduled to load the "ash basins" into a certain transport ship on the 23rd and "return silently."

### Two Banks in Shanghai Issue French Military Bonds, French Prime Minister Telegraphed Thanks to the Public Works Bureau for Purchasing Bonds, The Second Charity Lottery Will Be Issued

The French Public Works Bureau remitted 5 million francs to France the week before last to purchase military bonds. The Prime Minister of the French government, Leno, has now telegraphed the French Consul General to thank the bureau. It is heard that the French Public Works Bureau's purchase of 5 million francs of French military bonds this time is indeed a model role, and it originally wanted to encourage French overseas Chinese in Shanghai to continue to purchase

Bond Nature

According to the French military bonds issued this time, they are short-term debt in nature, and their terms are divided into six months, one year, and two years. In terms of interest, six months is 2.5%, one year is 3%, and two years is 3.5%. This interest can be deducted in advance at the time of purchase. The bonds are now sold by the Banque de l'Indochine and the Sino-French Industrial and Commercial Bank in Shanghai. The face value of the bonds is divided into three types: 500 francs, 1,000 francs, and 10,000 francs.

Charity Lottery

The French charity lottery company for the relief of refugees in Shanghai recently plans to issue the second lottery. However, the funds obtained from this lottery are not exclusively for the use of refugees, but to assist charitable causes in France and China. It is learned that the second lottery will sell for one yuan per full ticket, and 220,000 tickets will be issued in each issue. However, only 200,000 tickets will be sold, and the remaining 20,000 tickets will be used as gifts to encourage ticket buyers. The second lottery is divided into first prize and sixth and seventh prizes. The fixed amount of the first prize is 50,000 yuan, but if the ticket cannot be sold well, it will be reduced to 25,000 yuan, and the other prizes will also be reduced accordingly.

### Sino-Western Flower Show Spring Annual Meeting Held Tomorrow

The Sino-Western Flower Show Spring Annual Meeting, unaffected by the European war, will be held at the Racecourse tomorrow (Wednesday) from 12:00 noon to 7:00 pm, and on Thursday from 10:00 am to 7:00 pm. At this time of splendid spring flowers, the results are very impressive. Tickets are one yuan for adults and five cents for children, and there is no price increase (students led by teachers are only charged two cents per person). On the Chinese member side, it is heard that Mr. Zhou Shoujuan, who won the Sir Peter Grand Silver Cup Championship Award at the last autumn annual meeting, will still participate. In addition to more than 20 small and medium-sized potted plants, there will also be a "Eight Treasures Feast", which is to display eight kinds of flowers and trees in eight kinds of bonsai made of jade, stone, porcelain, copper, bamboo, wood, brick, and sand, which are ancient and unique. In addition, bonsai expert Kong Zhiqing also has more than 30 pieces of water stones and potted plants on display, all of which are fine products.

### Ningbo Import and Export Goods Will Be Levied a Relief Fee Starting Yesterday, 5% of the Customs Estimated Value Will Be Collected, All Goods Stored in Warehouses Will Be Collected

The Ningbo People's Food Relief Committee announced the method of raising funds for the poor people's food relief fee, which will be implemented from May 20. The original text of the method is as follows: Article 1, all kinds of goods entering and leaving Ningbo port, and imported goods not yet withdrawn from the warehouse (regardless of whether they are shipped by steamer or folk boat) must be raised in accordance with the provisions of this method. Article 2, the relief fee raised shall be 5% of the recent estimated value of import and export goods by the Customs, but if any underreporting or cheating is found, the raising office may investigate the market price and freely estimate it.

Payment Method

Article 3, when the customs broker or merchant declares the export of goods, they shall submit the bill of lading (or luggage list) and the declaration form prescribed in Article 5 of this method to the raising office for review and payment before exporting, and the raising office shall stamp and issue a receipt before allowing loading. Article 4, when the customs broker or merchant declares the import of goods, they must first submit the bill of lading (or luggage list) imprint and the declaration form prescribed in Article 5 of this method to the raising office for review and payment before exporting, and the raising office shall stamp and issue a receipt before allowing customs clearance and withdrawal from the warehouse. Article 5, whether the customs broker handles it on behalf of the merchant or the merchant declares the import and export of goods, they shall submit a "copy of the customs declaration form" along with the bill of lading to the raising office at the time of payment.

### Lin Yutang Takes a Short Break in Hong Kong, Chooses a Place to Engage in Writing; Lin Says that During the War of Resistance, One Should Sacrifice One's Spirit; Americans Believe Japan Has Absolutely No Hope of Success

After arriving in Hong Kong on the 10th of this month from the United States, the famous writer Lin Yutang resided in Kowloon. He then declined social engagements due to suffering from gout and recuperated. The Hong Kong Chinese Cultural Advancement Association, the Chinese Literary Association, and the Sino-British Cultural Association, among other groups, originally planned to hold a meeting to welcome Lin. They also designated preparatory personnel, and Professor Xu Dishan of the University of Hong Kong was sent to meet with Lin to convey the welcome from various cultural groups. Lin initially agreed, but the next morning, he suddenly notified Xu, saying that he would not accept the welcome from the groups, politely declining with utmost humility.

Lin's Clansmen Offer a Warm Welcome

Yutang's return to the country via Hong Kong this time was warmly welcomed by the people, especially the Lin clan, who showed even more enthusiasm. They believed that Lin's international fame brought honor to the country and illuminated the ancestors. Therefore, the Hong Kong Lin Xihe Hall Clan Association also prepared to hold a meeting to welcome him. At that time, Lin Ci Ming, Lin Yaohuan, and others were designated to be responsible for the preparations, but as a result of not being able to meet with Lin, it could not be held as scheduled.

Reporters Arrange an Interview, Enjoy a Happy Gathering

On the 14th of this month, reporters from various Hong Kong newspapers specially invited Lin to meet and talk at the Weishimen Restaurant. Lin arrived on time. After taking his seat, he first said that when talking to everyone, there should be no formality, and opinions should be exchanged casually. The reporters then inquired about his future plans for his writing career, the general opinion in the United States regarding the Sino-Japanese War, and the attitude of the United States and Japan towards the Dutch East Indies, among other issues. Lin gave detailed answers to all the questions asked above. As for explaining that he would devote himself to writing in the future and had no intention of entering politics, his words were extremely humorous. The following is a record of Lin's remarks, divided into sections:

Traveling to Chongqing, No Intention of Taking Office

Lin will go to Chongqing within a week or two, then travel to various places to observe the general situation in the country during the War of Resistance. After that, he will choose a place with convenient transportation to reside for a long time and continue his writing work. He said that this is the true nature of a scholar, and he has no intention of entering the political arena. Lin believes that being an official requires unique talents, which is completely different from being a scholar. Although Bai Juyi, Su Dongpo, Yuan Zicai, and others had all entered officialdom, they eventually resigned and left. However, there are also those who can both write and handle affairs, such as Zeng Guofan. When asked about his future writing plans, he replied that he has not yet decided to write major articles discussing politics, but he will continue to write within the scope of what is possible. Lin further explained in detail that during the War of Resistance, the people should sacrifice their personal freedom for the future of the country, and the control of public opinion is indeed necessary. All countries also implement it during wartime, but the question is how to implement it. For example, during the era of the Northern Warlords, Mr. Wu Zhihui wrote an article denouncing Cao Kun's favorite servant, Li Yanqing, and was even accused of insulting the Republic of China, which is truly the greatest joke.

The United States Is Extremely Optimistic About China

Continuing to talk about the opinion in the United States regarding the Sino-Japanese War, he said that after Guangzhou and Hankou fell in the previous year, the American public was extremely anxious about China's future. The famous American commentator Walter Lippmann, whose commentary is supplied to more than a hundred newspapers, has considerable potential influence. He once made this argument, but he is a specialist in European issues, and he believes that he is inevitably isolated from the situation in the Far East, so he made this conclusion. In the following year, the Japanese military in China made no progress, and news from foreign news agencies in Tokyo constantly reported rice shortages, coal shortages, electricity shortages, and labor shortages in Japan, believing that Japan's national strength was on the verge of exhaustion. They attached particular importance to the turmoil in the Japanese parliament last year, namely the Saito Takao失言 incident. They believed that the questions raised by Saito were what the Japanese people urgently wanted to know, and that he dared to raise them frankly, so one could imagine how激昂 the people's emotions of dissatisfaction with the government and opposition to the war were. Later, Japan invaded Bingyang and used the excuse of not wanting to extend the battle line, and retreated a little from 　後. The general American opinion was that Japan's aggressive power had reached its limit. On the other hand, in view of China's continued firm resistance, and those who returned from observing the interior praised China's progress, the American opinion changed from anxiety to optimism. In the past two or three months, they have all believed that Japan has absolutely no hope of success.

Severely Criticizing the Puppet Organizations

The establishment of the "Nanjing Organization" is not taken seriously by the American people. Although the Japanese side has been constantly promoting it for a year, those who are short-sighted may be deceived and think that it represents the "peace faction" in China. However, all those who are knowledgeable and thoughtful think that it has no value at all. Secondly, when commentators from various American newspapers gather, I also participate. When discussing the puppet organizations, they述 the relationship between the various puppet organizations and their internal affairs in great detail. I am still ashamed to be inferior. The American newspapers' tone towards the puppet organizations is quite刻薄. Lin explained that the Americans' sympathy for China is because Japan's invasion of China this time is very clear, unlike when I was in England during the September 18th Incident. At that time, the general public was misled by the Japanese propaganda and thought that Japan's investment in the three northeastern provinces had been infringed upon, so it was excusable to use force to seize it.

Japan Does Not Dare to Act Rashly Towards the Dutch East Indies

Regarding Japan's attitude towards the Dutch East Indies, according to Lin's opinion, the key lies in the United States. If the United States expresses its firm attitude, then Japan will definitely not dare to act rashly. When asked what the United States would do if Japan ignored everything and invaded the Dutch East Indies, it is predicted that the United States' economic sanctions against Japan would be implemented more severely to促 Japan to awaken. If the situation cannot be improved in two or three years, then the Pacific War will 　至break out.

Americans Admire Chinese Philosophy

Finally, he talked about his own writings in the United States and related issues such as publishing. He expanded on the various books he wrote in the United States, with "The Art of Living" being the best-selling. In addition to the above books, there is a book called "The History of Chinese News and Public Opinion," which mostly introduces Chinese academic thought and life philosophy, so that foreigners can have a deep understanding of Chinese history. The recently popular "Confucius Says" movement in the United States is to cater to the curiosity of Americans. For example, radio broadcasting and newspaper advertisements all use "Confucius Says" as a slogan. Small booklets are sold on the market with the title "Confucius Says" on the cover, but when examined, the content is mostly American slang or even low-level趣味文字. However, the general American public admires Chinese philosophy very much, and even associates Chinese old people with 　deep knowledge of the world and a thorough understanding of the philosophy of life. The conversation did not end until half past four. Lin wore a gray silk long gown, looking very潇洒, and his attitude during the conversation was also very sincere. He held a pipe in his mouth and never let go of it. Lin praised the ability of tobacco to help 清談 in his article "The Art of Living." Now that Lin has had a long talk for an hour and a half, is this also thanks to tobacco?

### Reiss & Co. Sued for Violating Commercial Agreements; European Situation Tense, Goods and Passengers Cannot Reach Shanghai; Defendant Presents Evidence Claiming No Violation; Case Requires Review of Evidence, Rescheduled for Hearing

Since Germany began its armed aggression, Britain and France declared war on Germany in September of last year, thus launching the Second World War in Europe. Up until the present time, the war has expanded, causing not only great suffering to the people of the belligerent countries, but also great damage to their commerce. German trade with the Far East has been even more severely affected. This is because German goods shipped to Shanghai must pass through British territorial waters, and the British naval and land forces at Singapore and Hong Kong ports inspect mail and ships with extreme strictness. Once enemy reports or telegrams about shipping goods to Shanghai are discovered, they are immediately seized. At the same time, based on this information, their fleet patrolling the sea is notified to earnestly search. If German ships or goods are encountered, they are

Generally seized and handed over to the enemy goods custody agencies in those places for disposal. With such strict precautions, it is rare for anything to slip through. Even if something occasionally manages to escape and is transported to Shanghai, it is often seized by the HSBC 　 British Bank, which handles the negotiation of documents. Therefore, since last winter, almost no goods have reached the hands of German merchants in Shanghai. However, various German products that they had sold to Chinese merchants before the outbreak of the European war could not be delivered on time, which greatly criticized those who placed orders. At first, they asked the other party to extend the deadline, but recently, with the value of imported goods rising, and

The European war is in full swing, and the general customers can not be fooled with empty words. As a result, disputes arose between the buyers and sellers, especially for Reiss & Co., which had many order disputes. Three lawsuits were filed against the company by customers in the First Special District Court for breach of contract and demanding compensation for losses. This morning, three summonses were issued: (1) Huacheng Iron Printing and Can Making Factory, (2) Taikang Canned Food Company, (3) Chen Jimao. The goods ordered by the above three customers were all Italian-produced lead skin (父名tinplate), with a quantity of 250 boxes each, and a fixed price of one pound and nineteen shillings in British currency per box. The company only

One batch was shipped and distributed to the three customers, still owing 155 boxes to each customer. Currently, the market price of this product is more than two pounds per box. Therefore, each plaintiff unanimously requested that Reiss & Co. be ordered to deliver the ordered goods according to the contract, or to compensate for the losses according to the current selling price. However, because Taikang and others believed that the other party had violated the contract, they requested legal protection, but they tried to be cunning with the litigation costs they should pay. They calculated the amount of the currency based on the statutory exchange rate of the British gold goods price and paid the litigation costs according to this amount. This morning, the presiding judge, Li Hu, exposed the plaintiff's attempt to take advantage of the court. He then announced the provisions of Article 404 of the Civil Procedure Law regarding the payment of litigation costs, stating that according to the law, 　 the litigation costs should be paid based on the market price of the

Goods in dispute at the time of the lawsuit. It was found that on the day Huacheng and Taikang filed the lawsuit, the market price of tinplate was 250 yuan per box in currency, and the tariff of 12 yuan per box should be deducted, so the market price was reduced to 230 yuan per box. The amount sued for was 155 boxes, with a total value of 35,650 yuan in currency. The litigation costs to be paid should be 507 yuan, 3 jiao, 7 fen, and 5 li. In addition to the 166 yuan and 5 jiao already paid, 340 yuan, 8 jiao, 7 fen, and 5 li should be paid. However, on the day Chen Jimao filed the lawsuit, the market price of the goods was 200 yuan per box, and 232 yuan and 5 jiao should also be paid. The plaintiffs

After hearing the announcement, they successively expressed their willingness to comply immediately and requested that the trial continue. Then, the lawyer representing the plaintiff stated that the true reason for the defendant's breach of contract was not that the goods could not be shipped to Shanghai, but that the defendant sold the arrived goods after the price of the goods skyrocketed, and then made the excuse that the goods were intercepted in transit. The defendant's lawyer, on the other hand, argued that only one batch of the goods had indeed述 arrived, and the second batch of goods was guaranteed by HSBC to be sold to the Polish-owned Lianyiyang Line. All the goods after that were intercepted by the British

Along the way, which was an event of force majeure. The contract had stated that if it occurred, the defendant would not be responsible. Therefore, the defendant was not at fault for the breach of contract, nor could it be held responsible for compensating for the losses. He also submitted a certificate signed by the German Embassy in China stating that German goods could not be shipped to Shanghai since the outbreak of the European war. The court then learned that Reiss & Co.'s goods were not directly purchased from the manufacturing Italian factory, but were ordered from the British Brock Company. It then summoned the Polish representative of Brock in Shanghai, Pan Erzhi

To the court to investigate the reasons for Reiss & Co.'s failure to deliver the goods. Pan generally attributed it to the war between Britain and Germany, stating that British citizens should not have dealings with Germany. At this point in the trial, because the documents and evidence submitted by the defendant were numerous, and the plaintiff's side could not review them immediately, the trial was adjourned. The plaintiff's lawyer was instructed to schedule a date to go to the court to review the files, and then the trial would continue.

### Xi Shaofen and Feng Ruizhang Accused of Fraud

Xi Shaofen, a woman from Nanhui, is 28 years old this year. She used to be a clerk in the Lianglu Bureau and has not yet married. She lives with her mother and younger brother at No. 15, Lane 245, Route Paulun. On March 10th of this year, she filed a complaint with the French Concession Police against Chen Zongtao, a young man from Guangdong (residing at No. 310, Route Cardinal Mercier), for issuing bad checks. As a result, the Second District Court sentenced Chen to a fine of 600 yuan. Afterwards, Chen claimed that the checks had been swindled by Feng Ruizhang, a classmate at the law school, and that there was a note from Feng to prove it. Therefore,

Unwilling to accept this, he hired two lawyers, Xu Wufang and Lu Ronggan, to file a private prosecution with the Second District Court against Feng Ruizhang and Xi Shaofen for joint fraud. The court, according to the complaint, held a hearing in the Second Criminal Court a few days ago, presided over by Judge Li. The plaintiff was absent due to illness and was represented by lawyer Xu Wufang. The details were stated briefly as follows: In the bad check case, the defendant Xi Shaofen claimed that she had given the plaintiff 28,000 yuan in cash in November of last year, requesting the court to investigate the source of this huge amount of money.

Whereabouts The defendant Feng Ruizhang was absent for fear of punishment. Only Ms. Xi and her lawyer appeared in court. The court immediately questioned the source of the funds. Ms. Xi defended herself, claiming that 15,000 yuan of it was a check dated November 20 from Jincheng Bank, borrowed from Zhang Bin, who works in the Ministry of Railways, and presented a receipt from Feng. The remaining 13,000 yuan was cash from the sale of land in Pudong. At this point, the plaintiff's lawyer expressed his opinion to the court, saying that the defendant claimed in the previous case that the payment date was November 11, and that all the payments were in cash. Now she suddenly claims that it was a check, and that it was Zhang Bin's money, but the receipt was issued by Feng.

This is very contradictory. Moreover, the defendant is not a bank, so where would she get so much cash? Furthermore, Pudong is an occupied area, and there would be no large real estate transactions. Even if there was cash, it would not be kept at home. He requested that the court strictly arrest Feng Ruizhang so that the truth could be revealed. After verifying the statements, the court instructed Ms. Xi to post bail and wait for an investigation into Zhang Bin's funds at Jincheng Bank 　訊

### A Robbery Occurs in Hamilton House

At around 3:00 PM yesterday, a robbery occurred in Hamilton House on Jiangxi Road in the Public Concession. According to reporters, the office of No. 312 in the building is Huafeng 洋行. At 3:00 PM yesterday, five robbers suddenly came, three robbers were wearing suits, and two robbers were wearing Chinese clothes. They knocked on the door and entered. The employees of the 　洋行 thought it was a customer coming to斗, so they were warmly welcomed. To their surprise, two robbers each took out a pistol and threatened the employees, scaring them into not making a sound. They also forced them to hand over their valuables. The employees of the 　洋行 told the robbers, "There is no cash." The robbers then forced them to sign a bank check for 9,000 yuan in national currency. One robber took the check to a bank to cash it, while the rest of the robbers stayed in the room to monitor everyone's movements. When the robber who took the money returned, all the robbers left and disappeared without a trace. Afterwards, the 　洋行 reported to the police station and requested an investigation.

### The Mystery of Zhou Junchang's Kidnapping; Zhou Is Not Wealthy, Possibly a Case of Mistaken Identity

Regarding the kidnapping of Dr. Zhou Junchang, the reason for his kidnapping has not yet been determined. If it were for political reasons, Zhou Junchang is committed to practicing medicine as his career and has never participated in politics. Even his younger brother, Zhou Junmei, although he is an economic committee member, has nothing to do with his brother. 　何 　 Zhou Junmei's political position is also insignificant. If it were because of his wealth, although there are wealthy merchants in the Zhou clan, Zhou Junchang makes a living by practicing medicine, and his family is not inherently wealthy, and he bears a very heavy burden. His elder brother passed away, and he is responsible for the upbringing of his children and nephews. He often provides free treatment to the poor and sick, and never haggles over the rewards from the patients. Therefore, for what reason he was kidnapped this time is suspected to be a misunderstanding. Zhou Junchang is weak, so he rides horses to strengthen his muscles and bones. It is believed that he often gallops on the roads west of Shanghai, so he is mistaken for a member of the leisure class and kidnapped. It is also possible. Zhou still has a mother over eighty years old at home, who cries day and night upon hearing that her son has been kidnapped. His wife is running around, but the reason for the kidnapping is still unclear, so it is impossible to rescue him.

### Kidnapping on Route Kahnert; One Japanese and One Chinese Abducted; Kidnappers Resemble Puppet Police

The English-language "North China Daily News" stated that on the afternoon of the 18th of this month, a kidnapping occurred on Route Kahnert. At the same time, near the scene of the kidnapping, a rickshaw puller and a person dressed as a farmer were arguing with each other to attract the attention of pedestrians so that the kidnappers would not attract attention. A German resident living on Route Kahnert had a view from outside the door and witnessed the incident. According to him, he saw several people in uniform, resembling "大道" policemen, escorting a Chinese and a Japanese man, both with their hands cuffed, from a building across the road into a taxi beside the road, and drove towards the Joffre district. As soon as the car drove off, the argument between the rickshaw puller and the person dressed as a farmer also ended. However, he did not recognize the taxi's license plate number, but only saw the white license plate hanging on the taxi.

Rehashing Old News Sixty-Seven Years Ago (390)

(See this newspaper from the 12th year of Tongzhi, Qing Dynasty)

### Goat Hair

There are a total of 489 trillion to 600 trillion sheep on the earth. Every year, 639 trillion pounds of wool can be sheared, worth 120 trillion taels of silver. The sheep in Manchuria and Mongolia, China, are rarely considered for their wool, so they are probably not included in the statistics. I believe that China should pay attention to this and use it to weave woolens and other items, which may also be a way to enrich the country.

### Poisoned Sea Fish

A poisonous gas suddenly appeared in the sea in the northeastern United States, killing all the fish and turtles. Fishing boats went out to sea to fish and found that there were 450 li of dead fish corpses. When alive fish captured beyond the boundary were released into the sea within the boundary, they all died instantly. This is truly an unprecedented wonder since the beginning of time, and it will be another test for 格致家.

### Regulations for 馬

There are often disturbances caused by 野鷄馬車 in the British and French Concessions. Therefore, British patrol head Ping Fuli yesterday ordered Bao Tan to inform various carriage companies that the coachmen pulling the reins are not allowed to sit behind the passengers and let the passengers pull the reins. If a passenger claims to be proficient, the coachman should still sit with him. If he does not follow the instructions or causes trouble, the coachman will be held responsible.

### Where Are You Going? (3)

One day, I was walking by the river. At that time, it was the peak of the flood, and the rapid current formed whirlpools. In the middle of the 数满, there were many firewood and grass, following the water whirlpools. They had no destination, so they would never reach any place. There are many people like this in the world. They work tirelessly, but when asked where they are going, their only answer is that they have nowhere to go. Their true feelings are disturbed and driven by forces beyond their control, and they can never find peace. The current of life rushes forward, signing them in the whirlpools, blindly swirling. Their lives, therefore, become part of the苦役 and cannot find a way out. This is very sad. The second time I was walking by the river, I saw many large logs floating downstream. If the water was rapid and shallow, the logs would often rub against the rocks. If the water was deep and slow, the logs would move forward very calmly. I therefore thought that it is easy for a person to go with the flow and be the same as everyone else. This can be said to be in line with the times, but it cannot be said to be surpassing the times. The interests of the masses are always downward. The third time I was walking by the river, what I saw was different from the previous two times, and it was even more exciting. The situation was like this: there were many sailing boats in the river, and because the current was too rapid, they all anchored on the shore. Two hours past noon, a wind rose in the sky. Although the wind was not very顺, the boat owners still raised their sails, using the wind slantingly, and 行舟 the goods to the destination upstream. They did not drift with the water, nor did they change the course of their lives with the wind. Their ambition is upright and worthy of our admiration. "Where are you going?" May all of you 行 water upwards, take on the burden of life, and strive towards your established goals! Emulate the boat owners and use the headwinds to seek progress. This road is narrow and difficult, but it is indeed reliable. (To be continued)

### Amidst the Escalating War, the Culture of Three European Capitals: Paris, Known as the World's Cultural Center (Part 1)

— Shi Tao

France has always considered itself the world's cultural center and the motherland of art. What has become of this cultural center in wartime? To discuss this, we must first remember that it has already sent six million men to the battlefield. All men capable of social activity have been mobilized. The collective strength of the entire French nation is now focused on the single, supreme goal of national defense. Therefore, today's cultural life in France—that is, the cultural orientation of the French people—absolutely cannot deviate from the nation's collective will: "We must win the war."

Total Mobilization of the Academic World

All learning is being mobilized for the purpose of waging war. France had already prepared a system for the total mobilization of academics before the war. People with outstanding talents are all serving in appropriate positions. This intellectual mobilization has achieved considerable success in France today. All scholars are now directly or indirectly participating in the scientific front. Doctors and pharmacists are wearing military uniforms and acting according to government orders. Specialized technicians are either assigned to military supply factories or are responsible for important guidance in wartime economy. Even free writers are in the same state. For example, the writer Jean Giraudoux has been appointed as an important minister in the information department. He is now gathering old friends from the literary world and journalists to handle the tasks of reviewing domestic and foreign intelligence and propaganda. Another example is Mr. Biraud, the former ambassador to Japan, who is now the director of the Far East Department of the Information Ministry. He has mobilized a large number of French experts on the Far East to handle propaganda and review intelligence related to the Far East.

Tranquil Artists

Since the beginning of the war, there have been no noteworthy developments in the French literary and artistic scene, and no outstanding works have been produced. War literature from the previous World War only appeared several years after the war. Therefore, France will certainly not suddenly produce new literature at this early stage of the war. The Salon exhibition is being held as usual, but almost all the works are from before the war. Only a portrait of former Prime Minister Daladier and some sketches of the front lines by painters on the battlefield are the few exceptional highlights of this year's event. Also, due to the extreme shortage of oil painting materials, the exhibits in the art exhibition are all small-scale pieces. In short, today's French philosophers, writers, artists, technicians, etc., are all protected inside the Maginot Line, without the worry of being disturbed by the sound of cannons. They are either immersed in tranquil contemplation or buried in the study of practical arts and other fields.

Reading Fever Under Air Raids

The issue of national education during wartime is prone to becoming barren. At the outbreak of the war, the National Library of France, known as a world treasure for its collection, as well as the municipal libraries in various districts of Paris, were all closed. This year, in view of the stalemate in the war, they have gradually reopened. As a result, Parisian citizens are still able to satisfy their desire to read during wartime. However, Paris is still under constant threat of air raids, so the number of books that can be borrowed has to be limited. When an air raid siren sounds, everyone grabs their books and flees to the basement. In this tense atmosphere, we can still easily see many crowds lined up every morning waiting for the library to open. The Parisian citizens' passion for reading can be imagined from this.

Essay

### Moth

— Bei Ji

A moth flew in from the dark window, flying, gradually approaching a dim oil lamp. The dancing flame and the shining light—a bright temptation—this small and brave insect endlessly circled towards the source of light, lunging forward...

My soul was stirred by a new consciousness. Did this little creature not come from a dark, damp corner?

I suddenly smelled a scorched odor. A wisp of smoke ended this little warrior's quest for light.

I was moved to tears. I prayed, and I vowed that it was time for me to escape hell.

I extended my hopeful hand: a quest for light!

Anecdote

### The Little Girl Who Petitioned Roosevelt

— Wen He

This happened around Christmas last year.

Sandra Grande is an American little girl, living in Newark, New Jersey, with thick golden braids. Before Christmas, she spent half an afternoon writing many Christmas cards. After writing them, she naturally wanted to mail them. But her parents didn't agree. Because the nearest mailbox from their house was across three busy streets. Of course, her parents were worried about a child crossing the streets alone, but they didn't have time to accompany her. Grande was unhappy.

Her father, being a bit stubborn, said: "If you want to mail the letters yourself, you should petition President Roosevelt."

Her father was joking with her, but after Christmas, she actually wrote a letter to the President, which said:

"Dear Mr. President—I know you and the Postmaster General are good friends. I am now asking you to do me a favor. Please tell him to install a mailbox on my street. Because I have to walk a long way to mail letters now, and the road is very dangerous. If he is willing to listen to you, I will be very happy to write you another letter from that mailbox to thank you.

Sincerely,
Sandra Grande

P.S.: I am only seven years old this year."

After the letter was sent, it is unknown whether Roosevelt read it. But in a democratic country, the government should consider any reasonable request from the people. So, even though Grande was only seven years old, her request actually had an effect.

On the telegraph pole across from Grande's house, someone actually installed a brand new mailbox! Although the mailbox was installed a bit too high, and she still had to cross the street to reach it, Grande's mother was so happy that she finally let Grande mail the letters herself this time. Her mother watched out for cars as she ran over with an empty wooden box. Standing on the wooden box, she proudly mailed her second letter to President Roosevelt.

### Honorable Children

— Mo Zi

Every afternoon, many children who come to attend the short-term refugee classes gather at the school gate, waiting for the regular students to be dismissed after four o'clock before rushing into the classroom to receive their rare two hours of education.

Although their clothes are old and tattered, and they don't have fancy schoolbags to hold their books, they carry a few thin books in their two dark little hands. However, looking at their reverent expressions, single-mindedly waiting for the opening of the "door of knowledge," there is such a deep yearning contained in those silent eyes! Every day, I silently watch them, watch their thin but lovely faces. Although I am very unfamiliar with them, my heart is beating with gratitude, and my nerves are also moved to heat. From them, I see the shadow of the growth of the new China, and I can't help but silently recite: Honorable children!

However, seeing them standing outside the fence, gazing at the children playing happily on the playground inside, and constantly showing tense expressions, concerned about the gains and losses of the ball and the ground inside, sometimes even dancing with joy, my heart can't help but feel a slight melancholy. The children playing with balls and rolling hoops on the playground are happy, but the joy on the faces of the children outside the playground indicates that the ball is also jumping in their hearts, and the hoop is also rolling in their hearts. At first, I thought that perhaps they had just come out of small factories, or had just helped their mothers paste some small handicrafts, and were now able to be so happy, after all, they were ignorant children. But later, I deeply condemned myself. A child's innocence and liveliness are precisely the source of their life. Even in the midst of great hardship, this warm and lovely heart should be highly respected. I really want to say to them earnestly: Children! Forget your suffering in this short time, keep this pure and warm heart, and you will grow up from suffering!

### Comments on the Styles of Hollywood Directors

— Xian De

A film critic for The New York Times once said: The director is responsible for two-thirds of the success or failure of a film, and the remaining one-third is the responsibility of the actors or others. Indeed, even with a good script and good actors, without a good director, the entire film can fall into a terrible result. Conversely, an ordinary script and ordinary actors can also achieve success if handled properly by the director. Therefore, we need to pay more attention to directors.

The following twelve directors are some of the famous directors in Hollywood. Based on my personal opinion, I will make a brief comment below:

(1) John M. Stahl: He is currently one of the "six best directors" and also the highest-paid director. His style is exquisite and delicate, and he excels at directing family dramas. "Imitation of Life" can be considered his representative work.

(2) Cecil B. DeMille: His characteristics are grandeur, detail, and speed. He is powerful in handling large scenes. His representative work is "The Iron Horse."

(3) Michael Curtiz: He specializes in handling historical films and "Four Daughters" type films. The widely praised "Robin Hood" and "Four Daughters" are his representative works.

(4) Ernst Lubitsch: He is known for handling comedies. His works are small but exquisite. "Ninotchka" is his representative work.

(5) William Dieterle: He is a director with a sense of justice. He specializes in directing historical and legendary films. His works are full of anti-dictatorship, justice, and sympathy for oppressed nations. His representative works are "Juarez" and "The Story of Louis Pasteur."

(6) William Keighley: People in Hollywood call him "G-Man Keighley." From this, it can be seen that he is suitable for directing G-Man films. His style is concise and free from the disadvantage of being "long-winded." Many of James Cagney's films were directed by him.

(7) Hitchcock: His style is magnificent, and he has a good understanding of handling mystery and horror films.

(8) Irving Cummings: His style is light and smooth, and he is good at musical films. His representative work is "Alexander's Ragtime Band."

(9) Howard Hawks: His characteristic is that there is more action than dialogue, so he is quite popular with people who do not understand English. "Scarface" can be considered his representative work.

(10) John Ford: His style is characterized by grandeur. His representative work is "The Informer." He has won the Academy Award for Best Director.

(11) Henry Koster's works are light, smooth, delicate, and appropriate. All of Deanna Durbin's films except "Three Smart Girls" were directed by him.

(12) The Whelam: He has a good understanding of comedy. His representative work is "The Perfect Strangers."

### The Drama Society Receives a Drama Award - International Performance to be Held on the 22nd

The International Charity Performance hosted by the wives of the British and French ambassadors has decided to invite the Shanghai Drama Society to perform "Wu Zetian." Two preview performances were held half a month ago. The British and French embassies sent people to watch and were satisfied. Therefore, it was decided to hold the official performance on the evening of the 22nd. The tickets, priced at ten yuan each, have been sold out by the British and French embassies. The Shanghai Drama Society attaches great importance to this international performance, so all the best actors have been cast in one play. There will also be a grand program that evening. Awards for foreign drama, literature, or film are common, but they do not exist in China. The drama group of the Sino-French Friendship Association will award the Shanghai Drama Society a prize of one thousand yuan on the evening of the 22nd to encourage their work over the past year, and there will be five honorary certificates for the best actors. The wives of the British and French ambassadors will be responsible for giving the awards. Such a grand program is still a first in the dull drama scene.

### Acting Becomes Reality

— Chou Cheng

Mr. Hong Songjiong, chairman of the local flower and plant trade association, is a man of many talents. In addition to excelling in painting and being skilled in medicine, he can also perform mouth tricks like a variety performer, such as making chicken crows and dog barks. The Shanghai Relief and Education Institute for Refugee Children is holding a charity performance, and he is the institute's doctor, so he is very busy with receptions. On the fifth day, because there was not enough half an hour for various performances, he was moved by the scene and used his mouth tricks to perform a one-act play "Tears of Refugees." He temporarily dressed up as a refugee woman, and a child from the institute played the refugee woman's son. Because her husband was bombed to death, she went out to beg, staying in the fields, with dogs barking at night, which was extremely desolate. At dawn, the rooster crowed, and the plane came again. The woman was pregnant and fled with her son. In a panic, she suddenly gave birth, suffering from hunger and cold, with nothing. The mother and son held the child and begged for help, recounting the circumstances of the disaster. The refugee child felt the pain personally and cried in tears, which was unbearable to see. The audience was very moved. Some even cried along with them. Mr. Hong's dog barks, chicken crows, children's cries, plane circling sounds, and the sound of machine guns firing and bombs falling were all lifelike, as if one was in the midst of it. Acting became reality, and everyone was saddened. So the audience threw banknotes and coins at the stage one after another. The host, fearing that the order would be disturbed, asked all the receptionists to come out and transfer the money for the audience who wanted to donate. As a result, a total of two hundred and three yuan, seven dimes, and eight cents was donated in national currency.

Writer Dr. Lin Yutang and his wife and daughter took a photo with film star Maureen O'Sullivan when they visited Hollywood.

### The Formation of the New Art Reformed Peking Opera Troupe

— Sheng

Regarding the New Art Reformed Peking Opera Troupe and the New Art Society, outsiders often cannot distinguish them clearly. I can describe the general situation of the New Art Reformed Peking Opera Troupe here.

During the autumn of last year, many young Peking Opera actors gathered together to prepare to organize a reformed Peking Opera troupe. Among them were Zhang Yipeng, Zhang Erpeng, Jin Suwen, Li Shunlai, Li Ruilai, Li Wenjun, He Yuru, Liang Cishan, and many others. They held several meetings and filled out application forms. Although it did not formally form, the name "New Art" was decided by this group of comrades at that time. Later, the New Art Society was established, divided into drama and Peking Opera groups. They filed with the Public Works Department. Li Shunlai, Li Wenjun, Liang Cishan, and He Yuru were in charge of the Peking Opera group, but none of them were established in the end.

Recently, Li Shunlai and others felt that they had to realize their wishes, so they organized a troupe with the core members of New Art and added Yu Sulian and a few others to form the "New Art Reformed Peking Opera Troupe" that is now going to Ningbo. Therefore, the backbone of the troupe are the basic members of the Peking Opera group of the New Art Society. They are using the name "New Art" because of this background.

### Shaw and Cathay Vie for "The Three Smiles," Cathay Willing to Concede

— Hai Hu

Shaw's Yue Feng is directing "The Three Smiles," and it is rumored that Cathay also wants to film it. The incident of Shaw and Cathay vying to film "Zhao Wu Niang" last year is now being replayed today. However, according to reliable sources, Shaw has already asked Mr. Li to negotiate with Cathay. Shaw has already started filming, and three sets have been filmed so far. Although Cathay is in preparation, if Shaw is forced to stop, the losses would be huge. Therefore, they are making a request to Cathay, and Cathay's manager, Liu, out of courtesy, and seeing that Shaw has already started filming, expressed his willingness to give up. A dispute over filming has come to an end.
