### Guizhou Provincial Chinese Army Recovers Nanning, Longzhou, Mingjiang, and Suilu Simultaneously Declared Recovered, Allegations of Conflicts Between French and Chinese Troops on Vietnamese Border Denied

Chongqing officials have formally announced that Nanning, the famous Guangxi provincial city occupied by the Japanese army on November 24, 1939, has now been recovered by the Chinese army. (According to a United Press reporter, Guangzhou Japanese sources claim that the Japanese army has officially announced that it is voluntarily withdrawing from Nanning because its occupation is meaningless after the Japanese army entered Vietnam.) (United Press dispatch, 28th)

Last night, Chinese forces on various lines in Liuzhou and southern Guangxi launched attacks on several fronts. One unit pressed towards Longzhou after dusk, fighting fiercely throughout the night, and completely recovered Longzhou at 3:30 AM this morning. At the same time, another Chinese army unit also recovered Mingjiang. The Chinese army is now pursuing the enemy on separate paths. Furthermore, the Chinese army on the left bank of the Zuo River also launched an attack simultaneously, recovering Suilu this afternoon. (Dispatch, 28th)

According to semi-official Japanese sources in Guangzhou, Lieutenant General Koyu, commander-in-chief of the Japanese army in South China, announced today that the Japanese army has voluntarily withdrawn from Nanning because continuing to occupy the city is meaningless after the Japanese army entered Vietnam. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)

Since the 23rd, Chinese forces in Binyang and southern Guangxi have launched fierce attacks on the periphery of Nanning along the Yongbin Road, advancing to Santang and recovering Jinyuling. On the south side, Chinese forces in the Jiandao area captured Datouling. Chinese forces on the western front pressed towards Shibu. Japanese soldiers in Nanning received repeated reinforcements and were supported by aircraft and artillery, but the Chinese army, determined to win, fought with the strength of a hundred, repeatedly charging the Japanese and advancing fiercely. On the morning of the 25th, the Japanese counterattacked Gan Village, Huxiang, and Yiling, attempting to contain the Chinese army. The Chinese army fought with increasing vigor and still defeated the Japanese on the Yongwu Road. At the same time, Chinese forces on the Yongjiang River bank also fiercely attacked the enemy in the Gaoling and Side Village area. The vanguard of the Chinese army has now reached the suburbs of Nanning, and the Japanese army in Nanning is shaken and appears to be retreating south. (Dispatch, 28th)

Regarding the alleged conflict between Chinese and French troops on the Vietnamese border, Chinese military authorities here have not received any reports. Chinese circles are skeptical of this claim, as the Chinese army has not entered Vietnamese territory at any point. It is reported that after French Ambassador Goki Mok arrived in Chongqing from Vietnam, French authorities urged the National Government not to send troops to the Vietnamese border because the situation in Vietnam was already quite difficult, and sending Chinese troops would only exacerbate the disputes. Although the Chinese authorities have not guaranteed that Chinese troops will not enter Vietnamese territory, the National Government has not announced that the Chinese army will take this action. The National Government previously announced the reasons for destroying the bridges and dismantling the railway tracks on the Chinese section of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway. Therefore, it is expected that if the Chinese army needs to enter Vietnamese territory, it will also declare the reasons for this serious action in advance. Some people believe that this rumor was spread by the Japanese army to create a pretext for attacking Yunnan province from Vietnam. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)

Chinese military authorities here in Chongqing have denied the rumors of a conflict between Chinese and French troops on the Vietnamese border. When Reuters reporters inquired about this news this morning, Chinese military authorities said that they had no information at present, but promised to continue investigating. Subsequently, the authorities announced that the news was completely untrue. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)

### New County System in Hubei Begins Experimentation

A reporter from Badong recently met with the person in charge of the Hubei Provincial Government in western Hubei.

### Xinhua Daily Advocates the Internal Transfer of Floating Capital

The Xinhua Daily in Chongqing recently published an article advocating the complete transfer of the Chinese government's financial institutions, including various banks in Shanghai and 300,000 yuan of national currency, to the inland areas. The newspaper stated that Shanghai, even after the government moved to Chongqing, is still the country's economic center. The huge financial losses suffered by the government are due to efforts to maintain the black market exchange rate in Shanghai. Before the relocation of the four national banks to Chongqing in the summer of 1939, this foreign exchange was entirely used by the Japanese. If the British and American people evacuate Shanghai, to prevent the Japanese from seizing it, the government should as soon as possible evacuate all its economic institutions in Shanghai. The newspaper also stated that the government's financial and industrial investments in Shanghai are no longer beneficial to China due to the Japanese blockade. It advocates taking measures to completely transfer these economic institutions to the inland areas to develop inland industries and construction. The newspaper further stated that this move would have no impact on the Chinese currency in Shanghai, because the Chinese people in all the so-called occupied areas firmly believe in the legal tender.

### Director of the Navigation Administration Department of the Ministry of Communications Defends Zhu Jiahua

He Molin, Director of the Navigation Administration Department of the Ministry of Communications in Chongqing, issued a statement refuting a report in a Shanghai newspaper by a British man named Thomson who claimed to have naturalized in China, stating that when Zhu Jiahua was Minister of Communications, his request for a captain's certificate was denied and Zhu had attempted to induce him to offer a bribe. According to He, in recent years, the Ministry of Communications has been extremely strict in the management of crew members, and has promulgated and implemented regulations for the examination of crew members. Whether they are drivers or engine room personnel, they must pass an examination before a certificate can be issued. According to the regulations, the person should have taken the examination, but he always refused to take the examination and asked people everywhere to intercede. As a result, the Ministry approved that it could not be issued due to the regulations. The accusation that former Minister Zhu induced bribery and advised him to pay a huge fee is laughable to those in the know. (Dispatch, 28th)

Editorial

### The Prospect of Italy's Invasion of Greece

Just a week ago, this newspaper pointed out, based on the recent international trends, that Greece is one of the countries in question on the eve of what is currently evolving into a world war. Over the past week, the various political and diplomatic offensives launched by Germany and Italy, as well as the reported peace offensives, have also been exposed by this newspaper as another aspect of attempting to expand the war. Unfortunately, the facts have closely followed our observations: news last night indicated that after issuing an ultimatum to Greece at 3 AM yesterday, Italy invaded Greek territory at 6 AM. As of the time this reporter is writing, it is known that German leader Hitler yesterday again met with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, which undoubtedly involves some new and noteworthy strategies that are connected to Italy's invasion of Greece. However, how Greece, Turkey, and other parts of the Balkan Peninsula will react to Italy's invasion, and how the overall situation will unfold, is yet to be reported. But looking at the causes and consequences, unless the news of Italy's invasion of Greece is completely inaccurate, or unless the Italian troops suddenly withdraw after entering Greece, then regardless of whether Greece's resistance is victorious or not, in short, the European war has expanded to the Balkans, and the largest powder keg in Europe has exploded.

Italy's invasion of Greece clearly demonstrates the vastness of Germany and Italy's desire for conquest and their determination to dominate the overall situation. It is not merely empty talk on paper. A country like Greece, which neither competes with Germany and Italy nor poses a threat to them, cannot avoid being subject to their aggression. If it is said that Germany and Italy are only opposed to Britain, and that in order to crush Britain and eliminate its bases in the Mediterranean and the Near East, they have to pass through Greece, that invading Greece is not to destroy Greece but to target Britain, and that this is an explanation of knocking down passers-by to catch up with the road, then of course no one can believe it. Therefore, leaving aside the various issues related to Britain and Germany, world public opinion will undoubtedly sympathize with Greece for being invaded.

Greece is a small country in the southeastern corner of Europe, at the southern end of the Balkan Peninsula, occupying a corner of the continent and standing with numerous islands. Its territory is only 130,000 square kilometers, and its population is less than 7 million. However, it is the earliest source of European civilization, having experienced countless periods of rise, fall, survival, and destruction. Its recent period of independence is only a little over 100 years, but it has already experienced many decisive international wars. The cultural level of the people is relatively high, at least it can be regarded as one of the best in the Balkan Peninsula. Most people are engaged in agriculture and commerce. There are no rich deposits within the country, and it is definitely not a big fish or a piece of fat meat in the eyes of the invaders, and is not enough to be an important resource for military aggression. Only the marble produced can be used as a precious embellishment on tombs, which is certainly not the main purpose of plunder! It is bordered by Bulgaria and Yugoslavia to the north, and Albania, conquered by Italy. When Albania was destroyed, Greece already had a sense of imminent danger. The southwest and south sides extend into the Mediterranean Sea, facing Italy to the west and Egypt and Italian Libya to the south. The Aegean Sea embraces the east, bordering Turkey. Assuming that Germany and Italy are determined to launch an eastern expedition, Greece will protect one-third of the eastern Mediterranean and will be the first to bear the brunt. However, there is absolutely no reason why Germany and Italy must conquer Greece before they can launch an eastern expedition. The Mediterranean Sea is so vast!

From the political and diplomatic trends of Greece in recent years, it can be predicted that its reaction to today's invasion will inevitably be to resist with all its strength. It has close relations with Turkey and an agreement of mutual assistance with Britain. In other words, it has multiple international connections in peacetime. When it is invaded and at war, Britain and Turkey are the countries it looks up to the most. As things stand now, Britain will inevitably provide full assistance to Greece, regardless of its political reasons, treaty obligations, or military strategies, under the premise that Greece resists. The strength of the Greek army is not very low and is worth fighting for. Its air force and navy are far inferior to Italy's, but its naval and air base facilities are not to be ignored and also put pressure on Italy. If it now provides its naval and air bases to Britain for use as much as possible due to fighting alongside Britain, it will have great value and great benefit for Britain's military operations in the Mediterranean and the Near East. Britain's aid to Greece is certainly in a very early and effective plan, and it is absolutely not comparable to the aid to Poland and Norway in the past. However, whether this aid can fully meet the needs depends on whether Britain can effectively deal with Germany's blitzkrieg strategy against the British Isles. Therefore, we cannot make an unconditional judgment on whether the actual effect of aid to Greece can be fully realized as originally planned. As for Turkey, this newspaper also stated five days ago that its influence on the direction of the European war is far-reaching, and it is one of the countries in question in the overall situation. Five or six days ago, this was a subtle mystery. Now, Greece has been invaded, the flames of war have spread to the Balkan Peninsula and triggered the largest powder keg. Turkey can be seen as being forced to the point where it must immediately decide its attitude. It is no longer a subtle mystery but a critical moment for decision-making!

Who knows where Turkey will go? We will then base our analysis on the close relationship between the Soviet Union and Turkey and observe the Soviet Union's future attitude towards the European war and the overall world situation based on Turkey's obedience or resistance. This is the key observation that Italy's invasion of Greece gives us.

### Emrys-Evans' Speech Reviews the International Situation: Hitler's Attempt Has Failed, Britain is Determined to Embrace Europe

London - Emrys-Evans, the Under-Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, delivered a speech in Gosport last night reviewing the international diplomatic and military situation. He stated that although the battle for Britain has not yet passed, its outcome has certainly been decided. After this, the battles of the British Empire will follow. Hitler initially wanted to strike the heart of the British Empire with one blow and disintegrate it. Now that his attempt has failed, he will launch a fierce attack on the second most important point of the British Empire, namely, Britain's control of the Mediterranean, Britain's lifeline to the East, and Britain's position on both sides of the Suez Canal. If Hitler can indeed drive us out of the East, then Hitler can hope not only to securely take the oil of Iraq and the cotton of Turkey and Egypt for his use, but can also transport oil and cotton by sea through the ports of his vassal states. At this point, he will have broken the British blockade and can then threaten India and British Africa. We know where his purpose lies, so we must pay attention to the events that have occurred in Romania, the conspiracy to destroy Bulgaria's independence, and the background of Hitler's meetings with Franco and Pétain. Although we cannot determine where Hitler's new attempt will be launched and how it will be launched, we must crush his attempts, just as we crushed his invasion plan of Britain, and then we can have the opportunity to attack the enemy. Now, those who are fighting against the dictatorships are not only Britain. The armies that Hitler will see united to bring about his downfall will not only come from Britain. At this time, the representatives of the British Empire southeast of the Suez Canal are gathering in Delhi, India, to consider how to develop their resources as much as possible to produce a greater striking force in the future. This is indeed an extremely important event in history. As Prime Minister Churchill said, this meeting will promote the creation of a new world of armed forces to adjust the balance of the old world. Emrys-Evans stated that the British Air Force will continue to destroy internal resources in Germany. In the early nineteenth century, we defeated Napoleon's fleet at Trafalgar and determined the outcome, but it still took ten years to achieve the final victory at Waterloo. Now, our air power is increasing day by day, and we can hope that Hitler's Waterloo will come more quickly than Napoleon's, and this result is equally certain. As for our war aims, we hope to see the principles on which civilization is based restored in the world, to see the basic rights of justice and freedom of mankind restored in Europe, to see the rights of minorities respected by the majority, and that small countries can coexist peacefully with powerful countries and cooperate with each other instead of being subjected to violence. At the same time, our first task is to defend ourselves with our efforts and to protect Europe with our example. (Reuters dispatch, 28th) The List of the New Australian Cabinet is Announced

### Soviet Gasoline Production Soars: A Powerful Weapon to Defeat the Enemy

The Moscow Pravda commented today, "The oil industry is a major sector of the Soviet national economy. The more oil we produce, the more consolidated our military and economic power will become. If anyone dares to invade our motherland's borders, Soviet oil will be a powerful weapon to rout the enemy. Upon completion of the Fifth Five-Year Plan, Soviet oil production will increase threefold, and gasoline production will increase twenty-fourfold (compared with 1913). Before the revolution, the oil production of the Tsarist era was far behind that of Europe and America. However, the Soviet Union must not lag behind. Oil production has recently increased. In the third quarter of last year, 46 oil fields and 10 refineries exceeded the original production plan. The workers of Azerbaijan, in order to further enhance the Soviet Union's defense and economic power and to thank the Party, the government, and Stalin for their assistance, have called on workers across the Soviet Union to launch a production competition movement to commemorate the October Revolution."

If we want to observe a world where the flames of war are raging, we only need to look at Europe or the Far East. Knox continued, "These flames were caused by dictators. We must not forget the old saying that the arrival of events is later than you think." (United Press dispatch, 28th)

Thailand and the French Vietnamese government have not exchanged information for a long time since France rejected Thailand's territorial demands. The official statement said that Thailand did not send information to Vietnam because "the Thai government believes that the French responsibility lies in reviewing Thailand's demands with a sympathetic spirit and treating Thailand fairly." (United Press dispatch, 28th)

Bangkok: Assistant Advisor to the Information Bureau, Gua Di, stated that he recently traveled along the Mekong River and saw that French trenches and telecommunications equipment had been completely laid out in the demilitarized zone within Vietnamese territory along the Mekong River. It is said that this move by the French has violated the agreement between France and Thailand that prohibits armament within 25 kilometers on both sides of the Mekong River.

### Soviet Authorities Prevent Epidemics

Moscow: In view of the spread of the plague in Manchuria, the Soviet People's Committee has taken the following measures to prevent the epidemic from invading the Soviet Union: (1) Establish quarantine stations at Otpor and Pugalan Station in Naye District, Vladivostok, Nikolaevka, and at the mouth of the Heilongjiang River. Anyone arriving from Manchuria, Cheongjin, and other places must be inspected. (2) Ships and trains arriving at the above locations must also undergo strict cleaning inspections. (3) Order the Soviet People's Committee for Health Protection and Domestic Affairs, the Executive Committee of Khabarovsk, and the Executive Committee of Chita District to strictly implement quarantine work. Before obtaining the approval of the People's Committee, no quarantine event can be ignored. (TASS dispatch, 28th)

### Chinese Employees of American Trading Company Arrested in Vietnam

Hanoi: French police arrested three Chinese employees of the American Far East Trading Company and the North American Enterprise Federation last night. Although the reason was not explained, it is believed that this arrest is related to the matter of heavily transporting American goods from Haiphong to Manila and Hong Kong. The French side has now requested that Chinese employees of American trading companies not leave Haiphong and has prohibited the re-export of American goods. As a result of 10,000 Japanese troops stationed in Haiphong, American goods stored in nearby warehouses have indeed lost their safety and convenience. At the same time, since the Japanese military demanded the detention of the French-registered "Xijiang" (phonetic) and prohibited the loading and unloading of American goods, the French customs has changed its attitude.

Yugoslav Capital: At 3:00 this morning, Italian Ambassador to Greece Grazzi, after handing over the ultimatum, declared that Italian troops would enter Greece at 6:00 a.m. Government ordered a blackout at 4:30 this morning, and then announced national mobilization a few minutes later.

Bulgarian Capital: It is confirmed here that there have been incidents on the Greek-Albanian border. There is currently no indication that any German troops have entered Bulgaria. They were very surprised by the news of Italy's ultimatum to Greece. The news came on the eve of the Bulgarian King's speech at the National Assembly, forcefully declaring Bulgaria's independence and neutrality. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)

Athens: Because Greece rejected the ultimatum, Italian troops began invading Greece at dawn today and have been met with resistance from Greek troops. While Italian troops attacked Greece from the Greek-Albanian border, Italian planes also bombed the Tato Airport in Greek territory, killing four people and injuring forty. The Greek government has not declared war on Italy, but has only announced a state of war similar to martial law. (United Press dispatch, 28th)

Swedish Capital: London Radio Station announced today that British aid to Greece has British naval forces already on the way. (Haitong dispatch, 28th)

London: The Greek ambassador to Britain had close contact with the Turkish ambassador to Britain today. The Greek ambassador received the following telegram from Athens: "At 3:00 this morning, the Italian ambassador to Greece personally delivered a note, accusing the Greek government of allowing its territorial waters, coasts, and ports to be used by the British fleet during the war, assisting in the delivery of supplies to the British army, and allowing the organization of military intelligence agencies on the Greek islands that are detrimental to Italy. The Italian government has no choice but to point out to the Greek government that the terrorist policies adopted by Greece towards the people of Tsamouria and the frequent disturbances on the Albanian border are all acts of challenge to Albania. Italy can no longer tolerate this. Greece's neutrality has gradually become a mere formality. Therefore, Italy has decided to ask the Greek government to provide facilities for occupying certain military points in Greek territory during the current period of war against Britain, as a guarantee of Greek neutrality and Italian security. The Italian government asks Greece not to oppose this occupation, not to obstruct the passage of troops performing occupation duties, and demands that the Greek government immediately order its military authorities to facilitate the smooth completion of this occupation. If the Italian army encounters resistance, it will respond with force, and the Greek government will be responsible for all consequences." Greek Prime Minister Metaxas replied that he regarded the contents of this note and its ultimatum nature as nothing less than a declaration of war on Greece. The Italian ambassador then declared that the Italian army's launch would begin at 6:00 this morning. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)

Athens: It is heard that a total of 20,000 Italian troops have entered Greek territory. Border warfare broke out at 5:30 this morning.

The King stated, "Italy is attempting to destroy our independence." Prime Minister Metaxas, shortly after issuing the message, declared that "Greece will fight to the

### Greek Government Rejects Italian Ultimatum

Athens: Greece rejected the Italian proposal for unconditional surrender this morning, and the government immediately mobilized all its troops and issued a public statement strictly defending its determination to defend the territory. According to reports, the Italian note was submitted to Prime Minister Metaxas by the Italian ambassador to Athens at 3:00 a.m., with a three-hour deadline for a reply. The Greek cabinet held an emergency meeting at 5:00 a.m. and decided to reject it and issue an order to mobilize troops. The Prime Minister also stated that the government had replied to Italy's request, stating that "I regard this request and action as a declaration of war." The Prime Minister continued that the Italian ambassador demanded that Greece surrender unconditionally, otherwise Italian troops would enter Greek territory at dusk. It is true that Greece does not have a large number of troops and may be occupied by Italy within a few days without assistance. At present, there is a strong navy stationed in the eastern Mediterranean and has expressed its willingness to guarantee Greece's independence and territorial integrity. The important Greek port of Salonika, which is usually called the key to the Balkans, Italy will undoubtedly seek to occupy it before Britain. It is also clear that whichever party obtains the port of Salonika first, the Greek land will become the site of the Anglo-Italian war. (United Press dispatch, 28th)

### Turkey Transfers Elite Troops to Northwestern Border

Hungarian Capital: Border reports between Albania and Italy and Greek armies that conflict has occurred again. The Turkish government, for the sake of being prepared for unforeseen events, has urgently transferred elite detachments to the northwestern border today to reinforce the 500,000 troops already concentrated there. (International dispatch, 27th)

Hungarian Capital: According to well-informed sources here, Turkey has sent elite troops to the Thracian region bordering Bulgaria. It is speculated that Turkey is quite afraid that after Italy's advance into Greece, German troops will also pass through Bulgaria and advance towards the Dardanelles and Istanbul. It is reported that large numbers of Soviet tank and artillery units have been concentrated along the Bessarabian-Bukovina border towards the Black Sea, but the Soviet Union's attitude remains a mystery. (International dispatch, 28th)

### Greek Side Denies Border Troops Entering Albanian Territory

Greek Capital: The Greek semi-official news agency has recently denied the Italian report that an incident occurred on the border between Greece and Albania. According to the report, the Italian Stefani news agency telegraphed from Tirana that Greek armed forces had entered Albanian territory to attack an Albanian military post near Korçë, but this is false. Greek troops have not crossed the Albanian border at any location. Greek military and civilian authorities maintain order, so there is no possibility of vagrants gathering in Greece. As for the Italian report that a bomb exploded at the office of an Italian lieutenant general in Santi Quaranta in Albania, and that the Greek authorities were responsible, it is even more fabricated out of thin air and ridiculous. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)

### Reports of British Fleet Deploying; Will Seize Candia Island

Southern National Capital: It is rumored here that warfare is already in progress in the border areas between Greece and Albania. The Italian fleet has begun attacking various prefectures, while British warships are sailing to occupy Crete (i.e., Candia), but no reliable news has been received yet. (Haitong Agency dispatch, 28th)

Swedish Capital: London Radio Station announced this afternoon that British and Italian warships have engaged in naval battles near the Greek prefecture islands. (Haitong Agency dispatch, 28th)

### Greece Mobilizes Nationally; Accepts Italian Challenge

Athens: Greek King George II and Prime Minister Metaxas announced a general mobilization order today, stating that the Italian ambassador to Greece presented an ultimatum at 3:00 this morning, demanding certain concessionary rights. It is said that the Greek Prime Minister immediately informed the Italian ambassador that the presentation of the ultimatum was tantamount to a declaration of war. Therefore, Greece believes that a state of war exists between Italy and Greece. All armed forces in Greece are on standby today. It is understood that the Greek Navy has begun exercises in the port of Salonika. The Greek Prime Minister is constantly in contact with military authorities. Negotiations between Italy and Greece on the Albanian border have broken down. When the Greek representatives arrived at the border, they saw that the representatives sent by Italy were only a low-ranking adjutant. This proves that the Italian side has no interest in this final negotiation. Therefore, the Greek representatives immediately withdrew, requesting that the meeting be reopened and that Italian military leaders attend. (International dispatch, 28th)

Athens: The Greek army has a total of 80,000 regular troops, with a potential fighting force of about 100,000. The Air Force originally had ten squadrons, but may have increased recently. The Navy has a total of 613 warships of various types, the main ones being the armored cruiser Averoff, ten destroyers (four of which are new), thirteen torpedo boats, six submarines, and four motor torpedo boats. In August, the Greek cruiser Helli was torpedoed outside the island of Tinos by a submarine of unknown nationality. The Greek merchant fleet has a total of 589 ships, totaling 1,855,000 tons. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)

### Greek Youth Hold Anti-Italian Demonstrations on Border

Roman Capital: According to Albanian newspapers, in the past 48 hours, many soldiers carrying rifles have been found in the area near Lake Prespa and Konipol, near the border between Albania and Greece. It is said that six people have penetrated one kilometer into Albanian territory and have been stopped by the customs guard. Hundreds of Greek youths in Kavajë, mainly students from Gjirokastër, held anti-Italian and anti-Albanian demonstrations on the border, holding Greek flags and shouting slogans. It is said that Greece has closed the border, and Albanian farmers have been prevented by Greek police from crossing the border to work in farms in Greece. The newspaper continued that Greek border residents were very excited to hear the news that the Central Army would assist Greece. Yesterday, a plane dropped leaflets in southern Albania, probably a British plane. The newspaper pointed out that border incidents cannot affect Albania, which has taken necessary measures in time to prepare to repel attacks from any direction. (Haitong dispatch, 28th)

### Italy's Failed Attack on Egypt Turns to Invading Greece

According to a Reuters diplomatic correspondent in London, Italian forces' attack on Egypt has been unsuccessful, so they are turning to Greece for an easier conquest. The Italians see Greece as having a shorter transportation line and seemingly more geographical advantages than attacking Egypt. Rumors of German troops entering Albania to assist the Italian army are also not entirely impossible. Although the Greek army is not yet fully mobilized, it may perform well against the Italian army fighting with its back to the sea, unless overwhelmed by Italian armored divisions and air force. Its fighting ability is at least equal to, if not surpassing, the Italian army. The Italian decision seems to rely on overwhelming mechanical equipment for victory, but the initial contact point, Epirus, is surrounded by high mountains, which is very conducive to defense. As for Greece seeking British aid to fulfill its guarantee, it is not surprising. British naval and air forces may quickly come to the rescue. From an international perspective, current attention is mainly focused on the Turkish government. Although Turkey may not send troops to aid Greece, if Bulgaria is forced by the Axis powers to seize the opportunity to gain access to the Aegean Sea, Turkey can put pressure on it. From the current situation, Bulgaria seems unwilling to be a pawn of the Axis powers, which is worthy of our attention. Finally, it should be mentioned that the influence of the Soviet Union on Turkey's attitude and activities may be very important. Today's meeting between Hitler and Mussolini in Florence seems to illustrate that Mussolini's decision to attack Greece was made voluntarily, mainly because he was not included in the discussions between Germany and the Vichy government. Therefore, Hitler had to condescend again and travel a long distance to attend the meeting. However, to infer any deterioration in the relationship between the Axis powers from this would be overly sensitive. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)

### Yugoslavia Declares Neutrality

The capital of Yugoslavia announced this morning that Yugoslavia will maintain neutrality in the Italo-Greek war. Yugoslavia deeply regrets the Italo-Greek incident. Yugoslavia has always been willing to mediate to prevent the Balkans from being drawn into the war. Now it can only quietly observe the development of the situation, hoping that Yugoslavia's neutrality will be respected by all parties. Political figures say that according to the Belgrade Agreement signed in 1937, Italy and Yugoslavia stipulated that if Italy took any action against Greece, it should notify Yugoslavia in advance, but Italy has not fulfilled this obligation, so the Yugoslav government knows nothing. Prime Minister Cvetković and Deputy Prime Minister Maček are currently not in the capital. It is reported that the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister will return to the capital this afternoon.

### Greek Dictator Prime Minister Metaxas

Greece Seeks British Aid, Britain Decides to Fulfill Guarantee Obligations to Greece

London It is heard that the War Cabinet is currently considering Greece's request for aid and is expected to respond soon. There is reason to believe that the details of British assistance in the event of an attack on Greece have been drafted by the British and Greek governments. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)

London The Greek government's appeal for British aid cannot help but recall the days after Italy invaded Albania. Subsequently, Prime Minister Chamberlain delivered a speech in the House of Commons on April 17, 1939, reviewing the situation in the Balkans, stating that the British government attaches great importance to avoiding any disturbances to the status quo in the Mediterranean and Balkan Peninsula caused by force or the threat of force. Therefore, the British government asserted that in the event of any such action that clearly threatened the independence of Greece or Romania, the British government would feel obliged to immediately provide all assistance to the Greek or Romanian governments. Relations between Italy and Greece became tense in August. In early August, the Italians, on the pretext of Greece mistreating Albanians in Himara, launched an anti-Greek campaign in the Italian press and repeatedly spread news of Italian troops concentrating near the Greek border. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)

London The Foreign Office issued a statement today stating that Greece appealed to the British government for some kind of assistance. According to news received in London, it is confirmed that the Italian Minister in Athens delivered an ultimatum to the Greek government at 2:00 AM this morning, expiring at 5:00 AM. The Greek government has refused it. The Greek Prime Minister informed the Italian Minister that Greece considers this ultimatum tantamount to a declaration of war. The contents of the ultimatum are not yet known here, but it is reported that it demanded the cession of certain military strongholds. The Greek government has appealed to the British government for some kind of assistance. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)

London According to responsible sources, Britain will fulfill its guarantee to Greece. If hostilities have indeed begun, then Greece may now be considered a co-nation of Britain. According to the terms of Britain's guarantee to Greece, it was announced in the House of Commons on April 13, 1939. The British government has not yet received confirmation that hostilities have begun between Italy and Greece. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)

### Berlin and Athens Telephone Lines Cut

Rome It is reported that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has left here today and is heading north to consult with Marshal Pétain and German leader Hitler in order to formally decide on France's joining the Axis powers. Political circles believe that Italy may revise its peace terms with France in exchange for most of the French fleet, which can enable Italy to cope with the British Mediterranean fleet. Today is the anniversary of the founding of the Italian Fascist Party, and a declaration may be issued stating that the Axis agreement will be extended to France and Spain, and exaggerating the victory of the Fascist masters in all of Western Europe. As for the news that a tripartite meeting between Mussolini, Horthy, and Beneš is about to be held, there is no official confirmation at this time. It is believed that if this meeting is held, General Franco will also participate. The meeting place is probably in the French region of Lirone, occupied by Italy. Vichy sources said today that French Deputy Prime Minister Laval will arrive in Paris tonight to make an important announcement to the French and German press. As for the whereabouts of German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, it is said that the German side is still keeping it secret. (International News Agency dispatch, 28th)

Florence Italian sources say that the reason why Florence was chosen as the meeting place for the leaders of Germany and Italy is that Hitler mentioned that when he reciprocated a visit to Florence in 1938, he was extremely admired for the city's artistic treasures. (Haitong dispatch, 28th)

Rome Yesterday was the 19th anniversary of the Fascist army's entry into Rome. Celebrations were held in the past, but yesterday, due to special circumstances, the celebrations were canceled.

### Gibraltar to Become Target of German and Italian Attack, Consequences of German-French Agreement

Zurich Political observers here predict that the German side will launch new military actions immediately after Pétain and Hitler reach an agreement. This can be evidenced by the Italian newspapers' prediction that there will be action in the Eastern Mediterranean soon. Critics in Switzerland point out that Gibraltar will be the target of the Axis powers' next attack. At the same time, diplomatic observers here believe that the Vichy government's silence on the proposals made by the German side is of great significance and feel that the Vichy government wants to present the fait accompli to the French people without disclosing the terms of the agreement in advance. People here believe that Pétain held a cabinet meeting in Vichy before accepting the German conditions, which shows that Pétain must first overcome strong opposition within the government. The resignation of Vichy Foreign Minister Baudouin is a sign that Baudouin is unwilling to bear the responsibility for damaging relations between France and the United States. People here do not believe that Pétain has allowed the French army to actively participate in the war against Britain, but believe that Hitler may have obtained strategically important concessions from the French side to conduct the war in the Mediterranean. According to indirect news received here, although the French people are eager for British victory, one thing to note is that France has now become an autocratic country and Deputy Prime Minister Laval has taken over all power. Regarding Spain, the diplomatic community here believes that General Franco does not want his country to be involved in the war, but if faced with the choice of automatically or passively allowing German troops to pass through Spain, Franco may be unable to resist.

### British King Sends Warning Telegram to Pétain, French Authorities Secretly Do Not Publish It

The official authorities here are still keeping secret the telegram sent by British King George VI to Marshal Pétain, but anti-government factions continue to discuss it, claiming that the telegram must be made public so that the French people can learn its contents before discussing cooperation with Germany. Only Pétain and Laval, as well as two other cabinet members, know about the British King's telegram. It is said that the telegram was drafted by Churchill and stated that if France hands over its fleet and military ports to the Axis powers, the guarantees provided by Britain to France will be void.

### Fierce Air Battle Between British and German Air Forces Over Southern England, British Claim Both Sides Destroyed Ten Aircraft Each, Britain Begins Using Night Raid Defense Weapons

London From southern England to the outskirts of London, there was fierce air combat all day on Sunday. The skies over the outskirts of London were filled with stubborn Nazi iron crows, attacking the capital fiercely. However, last night, the sky was completely dark, with only the faint light of anti-aircraft fire defending the capital in the distance. From dawn to dusk, British Spitfire and Hurricane fighters were active in the sky, without a moment's rest, to defend against wave after wave of Nazi aircraft flying from high altitudes and invading coastal areas. (United Press dispatch, 28th)

Berlin Several German light bombers continued to attack military targets in London and southeastern England yesterday. According to official sources, German aircraft hit a British air force ammunition depot and a power plant. When German aircraft crossed the London air defense line, they engaged in fierce battles with British destroyers, shooting down eight British aircraft. Five German aircraft did not return. It is reported that German aircraft bombed London from the 26th to the 17th, causing fires everywhere, and Kensington and Cricklewood suffered significant losses. (Haitong dispatch, 28th)

London The German air force attacked the British Isles yesterday, losing eight aircraft. The British side also lost six fighter aircraft, but one pilot was unharmed. An Air Ministry communiqué last night stated that German fighters and fighter-bombers flew across the coast in formation towards London and were intercepted by British aircraft and anti-aircraft defenses. Few actually reached London. Bombs fell in the London area and several locations in eastern England, damaging houses and other buildings in several locations, but casualties were reported to be light. Hampshire was also attacked in the afternoon, with several bombs falling in the area, damaging several houses and injuring several people.

London In the early hours of this morning, German bombers launched another night of terror attacks on the British Isles, sweeping across the Midlands and London, and reaching Liverpool and the northwest. Incendiary bombs and high-explosive bombs were dropped everywhere on the three islands. During the air raids, the London anti-aircraft artillery fought tirelessly to stop them, but German aircraft were still able to drop countless bombs on London, causing several more fires. Liverpool suffered heavy losses and many casualties. German aircraft encountered less difficulty in breaking through the air defenses in that area. There are several fires in Liverpool this morning. Several towns were bombed in the East Anglia police district and along the River Mersey. British military authorities have been strengthening London's air defenses due to the continued intensity of German attacks on the British Isles. New anti-aircraft positions have been added to key points in the city. According to well-informed sources, the British have completed "a real weapon to defend against night raids." This weapon has not yet been used or shown to anyone. The authorities are currently keeping this new weapon secret. London believes that the reason why German bombers have flown through the Thames Estuary to reach British soil in the past few days is proof that the Germans are only using German and Dutch bases. People here believe that Germany's bases in France and Belgium have been destroyed by the British Air Force. The German long-range artillery bombardment of Dover has ceased. People here also believe that this is very important. (International News Agency)

London According to a communiqué from the Air Ministry, the activity of enemy aircraft over Britain on Sunday night was less intense than the previous night.

At that time, there were not only patrol boats but also destroyers near the ship, but the commander of the German submarine, Yenish, was able to overcome difficulties and defeat the enemy, which is truly commendable. German light bombers carried out retaliatory bombing of London, destroying several airfields near London. Several aircraft parked at an airfield in Scotland were also destroyed. North of Liverpool, German aircraft flew directly at low altitude and dropped bombs on arsenals, hitting several targets. A railway station in York was destroyed by bombs. 300 kilometers northwest of Ireland, a British convoy was bombed by German aircraft, and two cargo ships with a load of about 8,000 tons were hit.

### Male and Female Marriage Guidance

— Written by Dr. Huang Zhongchang, American Medical Doctor

Secrets to Finding a Happy Spouse

Marriage is the most important issue in life; and in an era of conflict and transition between old and new ideas, this marriage issue has become even more complex and serious, and it is a problem that young people urgently need to solve. Young people often cry out in pain and distress, and although the reasons for this vary, it is feared that many are related to the unsatisfactory resolution of marriage issues. Those who initiate marriage are motivated by love, but the driving force of this love is only "beauty." So it can also be said that the first criterion for choosing a spouse is "beauty." But mentioning "beauty" easily makes people think of outward appearance, and it is indeed common for people to use "appearance" as the standard for choosing a spouse, which is actually a mistake. Beauty should be focused on reproductive instincts to achieve infinite happiness.

If we do not seek happiness in marriage, then so be it, but if we want to enjoy this happiness, we must protect the reproductive function, the source of this happiness. First, men must remain chaste before marriage, and self-indulgence should be stopped quickly. If you only care about the present, then premature ejaculation, impotence, reproductive failure, neurasthenia, and other symptoms will arise, and from then on, you will not be able to fully coordinate with your wife, and sweet dreams will be difficult to achieve. With the advancement of medicine, a male "Bǔ Tǐ Kāng" preparation made from the essence of strong animal testicles has been invented for this disease. It guarantees mental clarity, energetic spirit, rosy complexion, increased appetite, and very healthy sexual function after taking it. There are absolutely no symptoms of premature ejaculation or impotence, and it can also promote reproductive function and help the development of sexual organs. This preparation has been praised by countless Chinese and foreign doctors and is happy to be introduced to couples whose love has faded. Therefore, to save a bad marriage, only increasing "Bǔ Tǐ Kāng" can grant it. For women, it also has the function of regulating menstruation and seeds, and relieving frigidity.

### Youth and Vigor: Not a Time for Seminal Emission

— Dr. Zheng Ting, Medical Doctor of Germany

As the saying goes, "If you don't work hard in your youth, you'll only grieve in old age." Judging from this, if we want lifelong happiness, we should strive in our youth. However, young people today often wither before they age. There's no other reason for this than excessive sexual desire, the habit of self-abuse, leading to frequent seminal emission and depletion of kidney energy. Seminal fluid, aside from procreation, is also sufficient to maintain nerve excitement. Therefore, the extreme fatigue after ejaculation is due to the reduction of nutrients that maintain excitement. In people who suffer from seminal emission, this kind of nutrient is further reduced, and nerves show signs of weakness. Common symptoms include insomnia, heavy head, dizziness, memory decline, palpitations, loss of appetite, and over time, muscle wasting and shortened lifespan.

However, even if excessive self-blame leads to seminal emission, if one can recognize the harm and abstain early, all ills can be avoided. Local cold water friction, along with German-made "Ners Seminal Emission Tablets," can stop seminal emission. Furthermore, "Ners Seminal Emission Tablets" also have the effect of calming brain nerves, a blessing for those suffering from insomnia and forgetfulness, with remarkable results.

### Prominent American Businessman Returns to Shanghai, Discusses U.S. Active Aid to Britain. Aiding Britain is Equivalent to Self-Defense. Roosevelt Will Surely Be Re-elected in This Election.

Mr. [Name], a prominent American businessman and manager of an American tobacco company in this city, arrived in Shanghai on the President Coolidge steamship on the 23rd. He highly praised President Roosevelt's leadership abilities. He declared to reporters that the United States is now virtually involved in the European war. The United States is transporting all war necessities to Britain as much as possible. Ninety percent of the American people agree with President Roosevelt's transfer of fifty old-style destroyers to Britain in exchange for more bases for use by the U.S. Navy. No one criticizes this action.

Aiding Britain is No Different from Helping Oneself

Mr. [Name] firmly believes that if the Royal Air Force needs a "Flying Fortress," it can be obtained immediately. Americans deeply know that the fate of the United States and the entire world seems to be tied to the final outcome of the European war. Therefore, they are now demanding that Britain be given all possible assistance except for participation in the war. Mr. [Name] has visited fifteen of the largest cities in the United States and has seen that people everywhere are united in defending their country. The Americans he spoke with all feel that the British Isles are the first line of defense for the United States. People in New York and along the Atlantic coast are even more determined to aid Britain because they deeply know that they will be the first to be attacked if the American coast is attacked.

Roosevelt is Destined to be Re-elected

On the fifth of next month, the American people will participate in voting to elect President Roosevelt for re-election. Mr. [Name] has many friends who belong to the Wilkie faction, but they advise him to "bet" on Roosevelt because they also firmly believe that Roosevelt will continue to be the master of the White House. The majority of voters in the country have decided to elect Roosevelt for re-election because, at this critical juncture, it is better to elect an experienced hand to lead the country than to choose a new person. Wilkie's foreign policy coincides with Roosevelt's, so Wilkie's campaign is now focused on domestic affairs. However, at the moment, the American people prioritize foreign policy, and domestic issues can be temporarily put aside.

Wilkie Will Hardly Win

In his opinion, although the American newspapers are heavily laden with Wilkie's campaign speeches on the front page, Wilkie's campaign will probably not be successful. Wilkie admits that he does not oppose the current government's policies, but he also believes that he can lead this policy even better than Roosevelt. Wilkie is indeed a successful businessman, but the American people do not believe that a successful businessman is necessarily a good politician. Mr. [Name] said that the United States is experiencing a booming economy because of the great national defense plan that is underway, and the number of unemployed has greatly decreased. Skilled workers and artisans are greatly needed. The United States is now training a large number of talents to take on important positions in various munitions factories.

American Women in Shanghai to Elect President

According to a statement yesterday from the American Association of University Women in this city, the members of the association will vote in Shanghai one week before the presidential election begins in their home country. The association's regular monthly meeting has decided to hold the election on the 31st of this month (Thursday) at 4:00 PM. At that time, the presidential election will be a part of the general meeting's program. In addition, the general meeting also plans to discuss scholarship matters. This scholarship will be awarded to a senior female student at the American School before the end of the fall semester. Therefore, all members are urged to generously contribute funds for the award. It is said that most of the American women in this city will attend the meeting.

### Newly Recruited Soldiers Sent to the Front Lines Near Shanghai Mostly Died in Vain, Only a Few Hundred Remain From More Than a Thousand

Miscellaneous troops from suburban areas near Shanghai, such as Songjiang, Qingpu, Fengxian, Chuansha, and Nanhui counties, were gathered by the Japanese army at the beginning of last month, numbering 1,500. They were concentrated in Songjiang for reorganization and then escorted to the front lines on the south bank of the Qiantang River to fight. It is now known that when these miscellaneous troops were forced to fight in the Zhuji area, they were easily defeated. Most of these 1,500 miscellaneous troops died in vain on the front lines. Only a few hundred remain.

### American Chamber of Commerce and Other Public Organizations Host Banquet to Welcome New Consul and See Off Departing Consul

The new U.S. Consul General in Shanghai, Mr. Locke H. Head, arrived in Shanghai on the President Coolidge steamship of the American President Lines on the 23rd of this month. He held his inauguration ceremony at the Consulate on Jiangxi Road at 9:00 AM on the 24th. The original Acting Consul, Mr. Baderick, has completed the transfer of all files and responsibilities to the incoming Consul. He is scheduled to leave Shanghai on the President Pierce steamship on November 1st to return to the United States and assume a new position. The American Association and the American Chamber of Commerce in this city, in order to welcome the new Consul to Shanghai and bid farewell to the Acting Consul, have decided to host a banquet at the American Association this Thursday (the 31st) to show their farewell. At that time, the streets will be crowded with cars and horses, and it will surely be a grand occasion.

A Sneak Preview of the Xin Xin Beauty Salon, Which Will Soon Open and Take the Lead in the Far East. A Journalist's Tour of the Facility, Which Cost Over Ten Thousand Yuan to Build and Is Truly One-of-a-Kind in Shanghai, Featuring Scientific Power and Mechanical Equipment. Beauty Authority.

(Special Dispatch) In the winter of 1940, Shanghai will once again be excited and stimulated by a new business that dominates the Far East: the opening of the Xin Xin Beauty Salon, the first palace of hairdressing in the Far East.

The Xin Xin Beauty Salon is another amazing contribution from the Xin Xin Company after the New Capital Hotel. It resolutely sacrificed a large area at the corner of the hotel's entrance, sparing no effort to utilize the brains of designers. In just two short months, thanks to superior and substantial economic conditions, the old Xin Xin Beauty Salon was completely renovated and transformed into a radiant new appearance.

Let me give a simple report of my impressions from the tour here as a congratulatory gift for its opening.

In terms of its form, the Xin Xin Beauty Salon is divided into two floors. The entrance is on Guizhou Road. At the entrance is a "Xin Xin style" sample room, decorated with magnificent neon lights. This sample is uniquely created by famous Austrian beauticians every week, publicly displayed and exhibited for Shanghai ladies to refer to, study, and adopt. In the summer, there is standard air conditioning, and in the winter, there is warm air. This is the first time a Shanghai barbershop has provided this kind of service to its customers.

Upon entering, the ground floor is completely painted in milky white. Soft lights are reflected from the reflector lamps, which can protect the eyes and physical and mental feelings of those resting and beautifying for a long time. The "Innocent Love" rubber carpet on the floor absorbs all the sound waves of dozens of people, making it silent. This noble and quiet paradise is the best place for ladies to prepare before attending banquets and social events.

On the second floor, the color of emerald green refreshes the eyes of the guests. A smiling goddess in white brings you to the three-dimensional hairdressing palace, equipped with the latest and most luxurious crystal long-bulb electric lights from the United States. The amazing equipment shocks every lady with the authority of modern science and mechanical tools.

What's particularly interesting is that ladies, whether sitting or lying down, can chat with anyone on the phone without having to move. Entrepreneurs can handle office matters as usual while getting a haircut. Pretty ladies can also chat intimately with young gentlemen while getting their hair done.

Thus, first-class hairdressers have been gathered here. Moreover, the company authorities, who value the hairdressing salon, have strictly proposed that they must undergo three weeks of special training in advance. Therefore, after being trained in the service spirit and technology of Austrian beauty experts, they are no longer ordinary or even "white angels" that can be found in China.

Of particular importance is a brave and great immortal attempt. The Xin Xin Beauty Salon has specially spent a huge sum of U.S. dollars to order the latest invented automatic insurance electric unit for cold air and warm air from New York, USA, for exclusive use in the Far East. This machine is the latest invention in the United States and is being used for the first time in the Far East. It is warm in the winter and cool in the summer, a scientific miracle, and automatically insured for absolute safety.

In the service of the hairdressing salon, there is also something worth introducing, which is the attention to hygiene and disinfection. Not only are there two dedicated ladies specializing in the disinfection of utensils, but also everyone can register their own specially numbered towel for disinfection and preservation. If calculated at twelve hours of work per day, with thirty-two people getting their hair done per hour, three hundred and eighty-four towels are needed per day, and eleven thousand five hundred and twenty towels are needed per month. If calculated at one yuan per towel, the Xin Xin Beauty Salon sacrifices over ten thousand yuan per month for towels to serve its customers. Furthermore, even combs are disinfected immediately after being used by customers and wrapped in paper bags to show distinction. This shows how luxurious and noble the Xin Xin Beauty Salon is.

### Japanese Troops in Shaoxing Surrounded by Chinese Troops, Annihilation Expected

Japanese troops stationed in Xiaoshan, including the Sasaki, Koga, Kumazaki, and Ito units, occupied Zhuji on the 23rd and invaded Shaoxing the following morning. On the 25th, they were intercepted by Chinese troops in the suburbs of Shaoxing, resulting in fierce fighting with heavy casualties on the Japanese side. The Chinese troops, having achieved their goal of attrition warfare, shifted their positions in the afternoon of the same day. As a result, on the afternoon of the 26th, more than a hundred Japanese troops entered the city through the east gate and engaged in fierce street fighting with the defending troops in the city. The fighting is still ongoing. A major fire broke out in the city. Fresh Chinese troops are continuously arriving and establishing strong defensive positions, intending to completely annihilate the Japanese troops. The Ningbo area, including Shangyu and Yuyao, is peaceful, but the Japanese may bomb Baiguan and Cao'e.

Chinese Troops Counterattack Hangzhou

According to sources from Hangzhou, since the Japanese troops in eastern Zhejiang occupied Zhuji on the 23rd, the Chinese military authorities stationed in Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Huzhou have begun using flexible and elusive guerrilla tactics to counterattack Hangzhou starting on the 25th in order to contain the Japanese troops' rear. The Japanese troops in the city are panicking, and a fierce battle is about to begin.

Postal and Telegraphic Communications Between Shanghai and Shaoxing Interrupted

Regarding postal and telegraphic communications between Shanghai and Shaoxing, a reporter from the Da Guang News Agency learned from the transportation section of the Shanghai Postal Administration that the Shanghai Post Office is still receiving letters and money orders as usual, but there is no guarantee that they will arrive. As for telegrams between Shanghai and Shaoxing, the American Commercial Communications Agency in Shanghai has stopped sending and receiving them since the previous day. The Great Eastern Telegraph Office has also stopped sending telegrams since yesterday. All banks and money shops in this city that handle Shanghai-Shaoxing money transfers have also stopped issuing Shaoxing money orders since yesterday.

Japanese Troops Are Weak

Keqiao, which is 30 li from the county seat of Shaoxing, has also been infiltrated by small groups of Japanese troops, who are entrenched in the Keyan area. Therefore, the local situation is chaotic. However, the Japanese troops roaming in Shaoxing are abnormally weak, and their annihilation is imminent. According to observations by those familiar with the terrain of Zhejiang and Shaoxing in this city, the Japanese troops were able to enter Shaoxing this time entirely because of their mechanized units, as the terrain north of Shaoxing is very flat. This spring, the Japanese troops also briefly infiltrated the suburbs but retreated to Xiaoshan without turning around. However, to the south of Shaoxing, the terrain is mountainous and rugged, and the people are fierce and willing to fight. It is difficult for the Japanese troops to continue advancing south. The purpose of the Japanese troops' southward invasion this time is only to contain the Chinese troops' forces in eastern Zhejiang and does not need to be given much importance.

### Small Parcel Post Must Also Be Inspected with a Permit

The Shanghai Postal Administration issued a notice stating that the various items listed in Notice No. 1626 of this bureau on the 18th of this month, if sent in small parcels, will be handled in the same way as if they were sent in packages. That is, if there is no permit issued by a local Shanghai agency for inspection, this bureau will not accept them. This is hereby notified so that everyone is aware.

### Czechs in Shanghai Celebrate National Day, Pray for Liberation of the Motherland. Grand Flag-Raising Ceremony Held Yesterday Morning. Czech Association Issues Heartfelt Declaration.

About sixty Czech expatriates in Shanghai gathered at 8:20 AM yesterday (the 28th) on the lawn of the Czech Association at 124 Albert Road to participate in a simple and solemn flag-raising ceremony to commemorate Czech National Day. At the beginning of the ceremony, Mr. Stephen, Honorary Secretary-General of the Czech Association, gave a speech, emphasizing the importance of National Day and that all Czech expatriates in Shanghai must unite and work together. A team of Czech scouts, wearing Czech folk costumes, also participated in the flag-raising ceremony, adding a lot of color. Yesterday afternoon from 2:00 PM to 3:00 PM, and starting at 8:00 PM, the China Press wireless station broadcast a special program, broadcasting the Czech national anthem and famous works by Czech composers. Last night at 9:00 PM, there was an appropriate commemoration at the Czech Association, with Mr. Stephen giving an encouraging speech and musical performances such as singing.

### Declaration Issued, Wishing Victory

The Czech Expatriate Association issued a heartfelt declaration yesterday, saying, "Today, 1.5 billion Czechs commemorate the twelfth week of their independence. Three hundred years after the Czech Republic perished, it finally regained its independence and freedom in 1918. However, the new Czech Republic only survived for a very short twenty years. During this very short life, the Czech Republic was the most developed, most democratic, and most politically free country in Europe. Subsequently, the rise of Hitler's power created the darkest era in Czech history. The Munich Agreement of 1938 destroyed the prosperous Czech Republic, and in March 1939, the National Socialist Party violated its promise, invaded and occupied the remaining territory of the Czech Republic, and the Czech Republic perished. What followed was an era of humiliation, oppression, looting, and massacre. Today, 1.5 billion Czech people celebrate their National Day together. Those who live in the Czech homeland, under the oppression of the National Socialist Party and the secret police, are not allowed to hold meetings to commemorate it. They can only commemorate this holiday in their hearts. Last year on this day, hundreds of students were killed, hundreds were tortured, and thousands were imprisoned in concentration camps because they had commemorated National Day. For this reason, all Czech universities and other higher schools were ordered by the National Socialist Party to be closed for three years. However, the National Socialist Party's terroristic actions cannot stop the Czechs from praying for the victory of the Allies and the liberation of their motherland. Five hundred million Czech expatriates living abroad will commemorate this day with solemn ceremonies. They sympathize with their compatriots who are oppressed in their homeland and at the same time strive for the revival of the Czech Republic, and the Czech army also cherishes this aspiration in their hearts, fighting alongside the Allies and other armies resisting the National Socialist Party."

### U.S. Transport Ship USS Gold Star Sailed to Shanghai Yesterday, Will Leave for North China Soon

According to the English-language *Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury*, the USS Gold Star, a supply ship of the U.S. Navy's Asiatic Fleet, arrived in Shanghai from Guam Island early this morning (the 28th). U.S. Navy officers here stated that the ship's arrival in Shanghai is purely a routine trip. The rumor that the ship will carry the families of U.S. Navy personnel in this city is not true. The USS Gold Star will stay in Shanghai for several days and then may sail to North China, but the sailing schedule has not yet been determined.

### French Ship to Shanghai Defense Line Begins to Take Passengers

The French postal company’s steamship *Da Da Nan*, which recently joined the Shanghai defense line, will arrive in Shanghai from Manila and Saigon this Wednesday (the 30th) at 1:00 PM and dock at the Dongchang Road Wharf. After staying in Shanghai, it is scheduled to sail to Kobe, Japan, early this Friday, and from Kobe directly to Little Luzon, and then return to Shanghai (round trips from Hong Kong are not included) to return to the defense line. Subsequently, the ship will sail on a new route. The company has already started selling tickets and carrying goods. Furthermore, the *Kim Dinh* steamship will sail to various ports in Vietnam tomorrow.

### White Russians Fear Japanese Retaliation, Anxious and Afraid, Plan to Form Another Committee, but Are Rejected by the Japanese

According to reliable sources, several people who claimed to be representatives of White Russian expatriates applied to the Japanese authorities last week, requesting to form another independent White Russian committee directly under the "Pseudo Government." It is understood that this application has been disapproved by the Japanese military's Special Affairs Department. It is found that the White Russian expatriates in this city are those who sought refuge in Shanghai after the revolution in Russia, with a total of more than 6,000 people. They have been under the jurisdiction of the White Russian Expatriate Committee. In the past few years, the late Chairman of the former Committee, Mr. Metzler (who was assassinated), had provided a lot of help to these White Russian expatriates. When the Chinese government was in Nanjing three years ago, it did not recognize these Russian expatriates. According to reliable sources, the motivation for some White Russian expatriate representatives to apply to form another committee this time is because they fear Japanese retaliation, just like the fate of their compatriots in Harbin and Tianjin. Although this request has been rejected by the Japanese authorities, it is understood that these Russian expatriates may reapply.

### National Comforting Association Issues Shanghai Comfort Money Donation Methods. Donations Remitted Must Be Accompanied by a Letter of Explanation, Stating the Nature of the Donation and the Intended Use

The National Comforting Association believes that since the start of the war of resistance, compatriots at home and abroad have generously donated money and actively contributed. However, the procedures for donating money are still too simple, which has caused difficulties in handling. For example, if the donation is remitted from a bank, it is neither marked as a comfort donation nor does it indicate whether it is an individual donation or a group fundraising, which makes it impossible for the association to keep accounts, and often requires multiple inquiries, wasting time. A correction method has been formulated to facilitate investigation and benefit success. The various circles in Shanghai have now received the following methods: (1) When donating money from the bank, please provide a separate letter of explanation. (2) In the letter, please state the nature of the donation and whether it is designated for a specific purpose. (3) Please indicate in the letter whether the funds are individual donations, group donations, or fundraising income. (4) If receipts need to be issued separately, please attach a detailed list of donors. (5) If it is designated to be delivered to a certain person in the front line, please also explain in detail.

### Japanese Warship Detains Vessel, Arbitrarily Illegally Searching and Inspecting. Upon Boarding, Radio Communications Ceased Immediately. Passengers Were Intimidated With Guns While Moving to Different Places.

According to the English-language *Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury*, the *Mingsheng* steamship of Jardine Matheson, which came to Shanghai from Hong Kong, was blocked by a Japanese destroyer five or six hundred miles south of Shanghai Port, causing a delay of one day. It was not until yesterday (the 27th) that it arrived here. Passengers on the ship have vividly recounted the scene of Japanese Navy soldiers roaming the entire ship with guns.

Abrupt Action, No Results

It is not uncommon for Japanese naval ships to search. The interception of the *Mingsheng* is just one example. However, the Japanese interception of the ship seemed rather abrupt in some respects, and the search yielded no results, merely preventing the ship from arriving here on schedule on Saturday evening.

Opening Fire to Force Stop, Boarding for Search

According to passengers, at about 6:00 PM on Friday afternoon, as the *Mingsheng* was sailing forward, a Japanese destroyer suddenly approached and fired a shot to order the *Mingsheng* to stop. It then sent a flashing signal and dispatched twelve officers and soldiers by boat to board the ship. They immediately took action to disable the *Mingsheng*'s radio, preventing the ship from communicating with the shore or other ships.

Intimidating Passengers With Guns, Taking Items at Will

The Japanese soldiers then roamed the entire ship with handguns, intimidating passengers and taking items for inspection at will, often without any specific purpose. The officers leading the Japanese soldiers demanded that the captain of the *Mingsheng* allow them to interrogate all Chinese passengers. Although rejected, they forcibly questioned one or two Chinese people. The Japanese soldiers also searched one or two cabins randomly. The Japanese soldiers' search of the entire ship had no clear target and yielded no results.

Harassment Lasting Over an Hour

It is reported that Japanese soldiers had disputes with the ship's senior officers over certain points, such as wanting to enter the chart room. Although the crew did not resist, they firmly requested that the Japanese soldiers proceed according to established procedures. The Japanese naval officers and soldiers harassed the ship for more than an hour before leaving and allowing the *Mingsheng* to continue its voyage.

### Passengers to Hong Kong Must Obtain a Epidemic Prevention Certificate

The Chinese Shipping Department of the Taikoo Steamship Company in this city notified passengers that "The Hong Kong government now orders that passengers to Hong Kong must be injected with epidemic prevention vaccine and vaccinated against smallpox at the Health Department of the British Public Works Department or the French Public Works Department to obtain a certificate, and a photo must be attached before they are allowed to land. However, if you obtain a certificate from the Jianghai Customs Quarantine Office, a photo is not required. This is a notice."

### Commercial Banks Reduce Interest on Current Accounts: Not a Public Meeting Decision; Member Banks Unilaterally Reduce Interest by One Percent; Cannot Serve as Basis for Deposit Interest Rate Reduction; Savings Deposit Interest Rates of the Four Banks and Others Specially Increased

The Four Banks of China, Central, Communications, Agriculture, and China Farmer's Bank, in accordance with ministry orders, absorb idle funds, promote savings, channel idle funds into the mainstream for national use, cultivate a thrifty spirit and good habits, and widely establish simple savings offices. They stipulate that the interest rate for absorbing savings deposits should generally be 5% per week for current accounts and 1% per week for one-year fixed deposits. They may also appropriately increase or decrease the rates based on local conditions, without being restricted by general savings regulations. All facilities should be as simple as possible, all expenses must be economical, procedures should be as convenient as possible. In addition to paying special attention to attracting small deposits, they will also promote national construction savings, savings bonds, prize savings, etc.

Interest Rate Reduction Cannot Reduce the Crisis

Since Zhejiang Industrial, Shanghai, Guohua, as well as Continental, Zhongnan, Yanye, Jin Cheng, and other banks have successively reduced interest rates on current deposits by one percent, with the aim of reducing the burden on interest expenses, it is actually due to the excessive deposits of various commercial banks, which they are unable to utilize. Reducing deposit interest rates is beneficial to commercial banks. For example, reducing the interest rate on 10 million yuan in deposits by one percent can save 100,000 yuan in interest annually. However, most banks believe that reducing interest rates will not only fail to resolve the current banking crisis but will also affect the psychology of depositors, causing funds to flow into speculation. Therefore, the interest rate reduction by various commercial banks is done autonomously by each commercial bank and was not decided by a public meeting of the banking industry.

Bank Association Changes Interest Rates: Entirely Internal

Regarding the Shanghai Bank Joint Reserve Committee's announcement that the interest rate on national currency (i.e., "劃頭") deposits for member banks will be reduced from 3% to 2% starting November 1st, a reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency inquired with the banking sector yesterday. The interest rate on national currency current accounts of the Bank Joint Reserve Committee was originally 1.5% before August 13th. It was then raised to 2% to prevent the flight of funds from Shanghai, and later raised again to 3%. This notification of a change to 2% is still half a percent higher than before the war. This is entirely a measure for member banks and has nothing to do with the outside world. It should not be regarded as a general interest rate reduction in Shanghai. At the same time, each bank must not use the association's interest rate change as a basis for reducing interest rates for depositors. It is also reported that banks are implementing plans to transfer surplus funds inland, establishing branches in the interior and organizing banking groups to directly invest in the interior. They declined to comment on the interest rate reduction by some commercial banks. Individual parcels from the Dingshan Bureau in Jiangsu Province and the agency offices in Shushan Town and Hu　Town affiliated with the bureau should be temporarily suspended from acceptance. Parcels and large quantities of small packages from the Jianqiao Town and Hancheng bureaus in Hebei Province, as well as large quantities of collect-on-delivery parcels sent to the Youfang Town Bureau, should be temporarily suspended from acceptance.

### Gold and Silver Exports by the End of September Were All Shipped Abroad from the Southwest

The Inspectorate General of Customs has announced import and export statistics for gold, silver, banknotes, etc., from January to September this year: (1) No gold imports; gold exports of 10,131,160 taels from Chongqing to Hong Kong; (2) No silver imports; silver exports of 15,205,000 yuan from Mengzi to Burma, and 89,640 yuan from Guangzhou and Chongqing to Hong Kong; (3) Banknote imports of 156,028,342 yuan, nickel and copper subsidiary coins of 7,604 yuan, and Hong Kong dollars of 147,295 HKD; banknote exports of 3,038,945 yuan, Vietnamese currency of 903,300 yuan, Hong Kong dollars of 2,150,750 HKD, Japanese yen of 1,500,000 JPY, British pounds of 10,850 GBP, and US dollars of 75,000 USD.

### The Japanese Blockaded Western Shanghai Again; American Troops Implemented Martial Law; Withdrew After About an Hour; Residents in the Blockaded Area Suffered Greatly

The U.S. Defense Force stationed in Shanghai suddenly implemented special martial law in the defense zone starting at 9:00 AM yesterday, dispatching patrols everywhere and setting up small cannons and machine guns at key intersections such as Xiaoshadu Road, Gordon Road, Hart Road, and Avenue Road. The situation was very tense for a while, and they only withdrew after about an hour.

U.S. Troops Patrol the Defense Zone

The English-language "China Press" reported that the two alleys of Jessfield Road in western Shanghai are still being "blockaded" by the Japanese today (28th), causing many Chinese residents in the alleys to continue to suffer. At the same time, the Fourth Marine Regiment of the U.S. Navy stationed in Shanghai took precautions in the U.S. military zone west of the International Settlement this morning, dispatching machine gun squads and several patrols to patrol. However, there is no official news available regarding the activities of the U.S. military this morning.

Residents of Two Alleys Suffer Again

It is reported that Chinese residents in the two alleys blockaded on Jessfield Road must purchase special "passes" from the Japanese puppet authorities in the area for two yuan per person. Although residents are on the verge of despair, there are still many who do not dare to leave their homes. As for the number of residents who have starved to death in the week after the Japanese authorities implemented the blockade in the area, there is still no confirmed news. Reliable sources say that about eight residents have starved to death in the past week.

### Father Yau Flies to San Francisco, Transfers to Various Parts of the United States; Dr. Baker Goes to Chongqing via Hong Kong, Will Go to Burma to Handle Drug Transportation

According to news from the Chinese and Foreign Relief Association at 97 Nanking Road, Father Yau Ka-kui, the chairman of the association and founder of the Nanshi Refugee Area, returned to China by ship in June this year after the European war intensified, intending to engage in relief work for refugees in his motherland. However, in the middle of the journey, the European situation changed, and France and Germany signed a peace agreement. Yau stayed in Hong Kong for four months. It is now learned that Yau took a ship to Little Luzon at the beginning of this month, and then took a Clipper flying boat to the United States, arriving in San Francisco a few days ago. After staying for a few days, he will transfer to various parts of the United States to solicit donations for Chinese refugees along the way. The association has no way of knowing the details. Previously, Yau had once traveled to various parts of the United States and raised one million U.S. dollars for Chinese refugees. After returning to China, he consulted with the Chongqing government on the distribution of the donations.

Baker Returns to China to Continue Work

Also, the general manager of the association and general of the Shanghai International Red Cross, the American Dr.

Baker has been in China for more than 20 years, managing various charitable undertakings. After the Shanghai war, he was responsible for relief work for refugees in China and achieved remarkable results. Baker left Shanghai for the United States on November 21st of last year, repeatedly promoting donations to aid Chinese refugees in the United States. He was very concerned about Chinese wounded soldiers and called on the American people to step up medical assistance. It is now learned that Baker arrived in Manila on the Clipper flying boat from Honolulu on the 8th of this month and transferred to Hong Kong. From Hong Kong, he will go to Chongqing to meet with government authorities and then to Kunming and Burma to handle the transfer of drugs from the United States to China.

### Eighty-Five People Arrested for Using Firearms Last Month

Continued Inspection of Chinese Newspapers; Certain Words Prohibited from Use; Last Month, the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department arrested 85 people for using firearms in crimes. Eighteen firearms, along with a large amount of ammunition, were seized. All commemorative holidays passed peacefully. Six strike incidents occurred, affecting 5,399 workers. The more significant labor disputes were the strikes by 2,930 workers at the tram company, 2,100 workers at the bus company, and 1,500 workers at the engineering department. Fortunately, they were soon resolved. There are currently eleven shelters, and the number of refugees has decreased from 15,867 to 15,282. The inspection of Chinese newspapers began in August and continued last month. Three newspapers and magazines were warned by letter for publishing content that should not have been published. All Chinese newspapers were also notified that certain related words were not allowed to be used. Eleven new publications were registered, including two major newspapers.

### Weather Warms Up, Pressure Lowers, Number of Roadside Corpses Due to Freezing Decreases

### Rong Wenhao and Wife Have a Bad Relationship; Wife Files for Divorce and Seeks Alimony of 50,000 National Currency

Li Xiaoyun, a local woman and graduate of the School of Law and Politics, age 32, married Rong Wenhao, age 36 (the owner of Rong Wenji Construction Company on Julaida Road), the nephew of Rong Zongjing, a major flour merchant from Wuxi, through a matchmaker on September 11th of the 17th year of the Republic of China. The relationship between the couple was initially harmonious, but later, Rong became enamored with the beauty of Ying Yanxiu, Li's cousin,

Inducing Adultery

Afterward, his feelings for his wife suddenly

Became cold as ice. Later, after Li discovered her husband's secret affair, she asked her cousin, Yu Weixuan, to catch them in the act. At that time, Rong voluntarily wrote an agreement to compensate Yu 10,000 yuan in damages, paying 8,000 yuan on the spot, with the remaining 2,000 yuan guaranteed by Li, to be paid within a time limit. Afterward, Rong and Ying continued their cohabitation. In May of the 21st year of the Republic of China, in order to maintain his relationship with Li, he commissioned lawyer Zhu Zhenlu to

Provide Proof and Write an Agreement

Stating that if he were to abandon her, he would

Willingly pay Li 50,000 yuan in alimony. Subsequently, in June of the same year, Rong suddenly wrote a suicide note to Li, stating that "life is uninteresting, and I have gone to Wusongkou to drown myself." After receiving the letter, Li tried her best to investigate and learned that her husband and Ying had already been living together in Ningbo. Rong was also working as the manager of the Lixing Tobacco Company in Ningbo. Li then rushed to Ningbo and reported the adultery to the police station, which can be verified. From then on, the relationship between the couple

Became Even Worse

In the 27th year of the Republic of China, Li

For the sake of her future happiness, she filed a divorce petition against Rong in the First Special Court. The divorce was granted, and the two parties were divorced. Later, Rong learned that Li had another affair and reported it to the police. After investigating, the police found no evidence, and Rong no longer had the right as a husband. The case was dismissed. Recently, Li hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit against Rong in the Civil Division of the Second Court, seeking the 50,000 yuan in alimony.

The Court Received the Complaint

Yesterday afternoon, judge Yu Changzi presided over the hearing in the Civil

Seventh Division. Both parties arrived in court on time. First, the plaintiff presented the above-mentioned events. The defendant, Rong Wenhao, admitted that the information was true but claimed that he was currently unable to pay such a large sum of money. After a detailed interrogation by Judge Yu, the case was complex, and he announced that the hearing would be adjourned.

Everyone knows the harm of opium. Mr. Yang Shaoqing previously quit his opium addiction at the Chinese Anti-Smoking Sanatorium at the intersection of Route Lafayette and Rue Massenet.

### This City's Review of Middle School Student Records: Preliminary Results to be Announced Soon; Schools' Submission of Rosters Can be Completed by the End of the Month; All Review Standards Are Generally the Same as Before

(Dahua News Agency) This city's public and private middle schools' student records have been reviewed since this semester. According to the regulations of the Ministry of Education on the reorganization of middle school student records in Shanghai during the war, starting from the first semester of the 29th year, each school should keep the admission documents of new students and transfer students until the end of the semester and then return them. They should also submit the rosters of continuing students, new students, and transfer students within the specified period to allow personnel to be dispatched to each school to review them one by one based on the rosters. If a school fails to comply or if discrepancies are found in the student records, their student records will not be recognized, and the graduation certificates they issue will not be reprinted when local education administrative agencies are restored. The schools that submit the rosters will also be publicly announced at any time. It is learned that the review work for this semester began on October 1st and is currently in progress. Details are as follows:

Submission of Rosters Deadline at the End of the Month

Each school's submission of rosters of continuing students, new students, and transfer students for this semester is due by the end of this month. These rosters can be purchased from the Zhengzhong Bookstore on Fuzhou Road. Approximately seventy to eighty percent of the public and private middle schools in the city have already submitted them. It is expected that all of them will be submitted by the end of this month. Personnel are currently being dispatched to the schools that have submitted rosters to conduct a general review. Based on the review results, instructions will be issued separately in accordance with laws and regulations. The work is being carried out with great urgency.

Preliminary Results to be Announced Soon

The public announcement of the review results will begin with the public announcement in the newspapers of the names of the schools that have submitted student rosters, so that the students of each school know that their student records have been reported by the school and are subject to review. It is learned that the schools subject to review are limited to public and private schools that have been registered or approved to open. Schools that have not been registered or approved to open are not subject to review because their student records are fundamentally invalid. Therefore, after the list of these schools is announced, students can find out whether the school they are attending has obtained legal status. This indirectly serves to crack down on illegal private schools.

Review Standards Generally the Same as Before

Regarding the review standards, they generally follow the provisions of laws and regulations. Although the review

Methods are slightly different from before the war due to factual limitations, there is little change in principle. The main points are as follows: (1) The number of places for students with equivalent academic qualifications remains 30% for junior high school and 20% for senior high school. This number of places for students with equivalent academic qualifications is still limited to first-year freshmen. There are no such places for transfer students in any grade. (2) Certificates issued by unregistered private schools are deemed invalid. The students admitted are included in the calculation of the number of places for students with equivalent academic qualifications. (3) When the number of students with equivalent academic qualifications exceeds the quota, the school will conduct screening tests, submit the results, and wait for review. The best students will be selected and admitted within the prescribed quota, and the remaining students will not be recognized. (4) Students from the occupied areas can be handled according to the pre-war principle of reviewing the student records of students from the Northeast Four Provinces, or they can be counted as having equivalent academic qualifications. All unofficial certificates will be revoked and destroyed.

### Donations of Cold Weather Clothing and Cash from the Education Sector Far Exceed Last Year's Results

Make the Greatest Effort in These Final Three Days

(Dahua News Agency) The various schools in this city are sparing no effort in promoting this year's campaign to solicit donations for cold weather clothing and cash. The targets of the solicitation are not only limited to the staff and students of the school, but also extended to the families and friends of the students. The results are very different and far exceed last year's. It is estimated that by the end of this month, the total amount solicited will be close to 100,000 yuan. Part of this cash is directly remitted to the Chongqing Solicitation Headquarters by the schools, and most of it is submitted to the newspapers that collect the donations. However, their names are either the names of individual staff and students without the school name or alternative names without mentioning the school. However, the amount of their solicitations is reported separately to the education sector and the Shanghai branch for verification and statistics. All sectors admire the enthusiasm of the education sector. It is learned that the various schools will end this solicitation campaign by the end of this month and will make the greatest effort in these final three days. It is also learned that the results of the compulsory education sector are also very impressive after the Compulsory Education Promotion Association formulated methods to promote it on a large scale. Most of the donations have been submitted. It is heard that the Compulsory Education Promotion Association has instructed the districts that have not yet paid to submit the donations directly to the newspapers that collect the donations by the end of this month in order to end the campaign as soon as possible.

### Finance, The Supply and Demand Situation is Greatly Disparate

The US Dollar Finally Breaks Through Six Yuan, News Increasingly Favorable, Chinese Merchants Fall into Legal Tender

Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: HSBC's listed prices did not fluctuate. In the black market, the British and American exchange rates continued to loosen. The US dollar reached 6.15625 yuan, and the British gold will hit the 4-ounce mark. The reason is that the peaceful atmosphere between China and Japan, although known to be absurd, has not dissipated. The European war has spread to Greece, and Hong Kong suddenly reported tension. Moreover, the United States' participation in the war is inevitable. Chinese merchants sold a huge amount of more than 1 million, and the foreign firms' intake was very weak. Only HSBC slightly maintained it, but the disparity between the crowds was too great, and the trend was fierce. As a result, the evening closing was 3 ounces 96875 for British gold and 6.15625 yuan for the US dollar, which was longer than the weekend closing by 125 and 1875 for British and American, respectively.

The balance tax on silver was also announced, and there was no increase or decrease. After this, Hong Kong Electric also came to sell this month's shillings. It is estimated that the price absorbed by foreign firms was 3 ounces 875. At that time, the situation in Hong Kong was reported to be tight, and the news was unfavorable. Speculators sold fiercely, but foreign firms had no further purchases. Only HSBC was willing to buy. The US dollar price had loosened to 6.0625 yuan. The noon closing was slightly flat: 3 ounces 890625 for spot British gold and 6.03125 yuan for the US dollar, which was harder than the morning opening by 0.046875 for British and longer by 0.0625 for American.

British Gold Approaching 4-Ounce Mark

Chinese merchants absorbed this month's British gold at 3 ounces 9375 to foreign firms. Later, speculators sold this month's US dollar to HSBC and Mai Jia Li at 6.125 and 15625 yuan. It was heard that speculators were selling a lot. The evening closing was 3 ounces 96875 for British gold and 6.15625 yuan for the US dollar.

A certain gold house absorbed it with all its strength, and the securities firms took profits to cover short positions, and a rebound of 30 yuan occurred suddenly. The gold houses entered dozens of taels of silver houses and rose to 5,580 yuan. At that time, a certain silver house and small money house sold it, and it fell to 5,545 yuan.

The securities firms entered ten taels of gold houses and rose to 5,590 yuan. However, the foreign exchange loosened, and the US dollar was difficult to sell at 6.0625 yuan. Gold houses, silver houses, small money houses, retail investors, etc. sold it with all their strength, and it was heard that the cash had fallen to 5,600 yuan, and it was still falling. The market was even more empty, and the price fell by 90 yuan. Silver houses did each other ten taels and fell to 5,500 yuan. At noon, retail short positions made up and gradually rebounded. Silver houses did each other ten taels again, and the noon closing was 5,520 yuan. After the closing, it gradually fell to 5,505 yuan, causing the price to fall to within 5,500 yuan at the afternoon opening. A certain silver house gave ten taels of gold houses, the price was 5,480 yuan, and the price of 20 yuan was 5,460 yuan. At that time, a certain money house came in, and there was a rebound. Another money house gave ten taels of silver houses and rose to the 5,500 yuan mark. However, the foreign exchange loosened and did not return.

The difference between the high and low on that day was 195 yuan, but after the closing, it fell to 5,395 yuan, and after the closing, it fell to around 5,390 yuan.

In the morning, the discount purchase fell to 8.25 yuan and the discount sale was only about 9.25 yuan, which was 2.25 yuan lower than last Saturday. The interest rate of the money industry association rose by 0.01 yuan. The morning and afternoon markets both hung 0.12 yuan, it is said.

### Most Foreign Currencies Have Fallen, Only Japanese Notes Remain Strong

Yesterday's foreign currency market situation: because the peaceful atmosphere has not yet disappeared, and there are rumors that the situation in Hong Kong is suddenly tight, resulting in a sharp drop in the raw gold market price. British gold notes were stagnant due to a lack of advisors. The supply of US dollar notes was unusually strong, and the market price continued to decline. The evening market fell to 15.5 yuan. Hong Kong notes fell by 0.04 yuan following the decline in Hong Kong-Shanghai exchange rates. In addition, Singapore, Rupee, Philippines, Canada, etc. notes all tended to fall.

### Grain, Foreign Exchange Loosening, Foreign Rice Coming in Waves Again, Hoarding Households Raising Prices Ultimately Fails and Still See a Little

Foreign rice continues to arrive in Shanghai in an endless stream. Jardine Matheson's Mingsheng wheel brought 3,046 bags from Hong Kong, arrived at the port the night before last (26th), and docked at the Roosevelt Wharf in the French Concession. It was unloaded yesterday. Taikoo's Qiongzhou wheel also transported 7,474 bags from Hong Kong, and Qingyuan wheel also brought 3,077 bags from Hong Kong. Both arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning. Qingyuan continued to dock at the company's wharf on the Bund of the French Concession to unload, and the Qiongzhou wheel docked at the company's wharf in Pudong to unload. (Rental)

After the foreign rice market opened yesterday morning, because the previous day was a holiday, the shops had some actual sales and came to the market to add to their supplies. Floating households and retail customers also inquired, and the market seemed to be thriving. However, after the price rose by 0.5 to 0.6 yuan, large households took the opportunity to sell, and the previously ordered foreign rice continued to be transshipped in batches. A large amount of goods en route could soon arrive in Shanghai in full, and the selling atmosphere in the market was extremely strong. The market hovered and fell. The noon closing was still similar to the Saturday evening market. No. 1 New Saigon was as high as 67.4 yuan to 66.5 yuan, No. 2 was 72.2 yuan to 71 yuan, Special Self-Roasted was 66 yuan to 64.5 yuan, No. 2 Logao was 61 yuan to 59 yuan, Small Roasted was 60.05 yuan to 59 yuan, Rice was 55.2 yuan to 55 yuan, Broken Tip was 51.2 yuan to 50.07 yuan, Tokyo Tip was 56.5 yuan, Wuhu Tip was 58.8 yuan to 57 yuan, and in the afternoon, because the foreign exchange was long, which was not conducive to hoarding, the market was weak and fell sharply by 1 yuan. No. 2 Red Pagoda brand was 62.2 yuan in the early market, and only 61.12 yuan in the afternoon. Original packaged goods were 74.5 yuan in the early market, and there was still a lack of smooth sales in the afternoon. Rossi's No. 2 Saigon was only 73 yuan, and the goods en route were 72.5 yuan. The evening closing was still soft, with a total of 350 tons of original packaged and current route goods opened throughout the day and 6,000 bags of spot goods.

More than 2,000 bags of new Japonica tip and kiln-seed wild rice first-class rice arrived in total, mostly kiln-seed, and the route was narrow, resulting in a looser selling price, depreciating by more than 0.5 yuan, opening at 75 yuan to 74.2 yuan. The arrival and sale of new Japonica and wild rice were similar, without much fluctuation. New Japonica opened as high as 73 yuan to 71 yuan, the original package was 74.5 yuan, wild rice was 79 yuan, to 77 yuan. Du Yangjian still lacked fluctuations, and the original package was sold for 70 yuan. Broken Japonica was 70 yuan yesterday, to 74 yuan, and the original package was 80 yuan. Glutinous rice, domestic and foreign goods, were also flat.

### Fixed Price Loosening, Current Powder Softening

The noodles and rice market was still flat and tired yesterday. The market price for No. 1 flour mill was still 17 yuan, and the customer price was 18.5 yuan, which were similar to last week. However, the quantity released by the mills has exceeded 10,000 bags, which is sufficient for the needs of this street. Therefore, the returning goods and old cart warehouse orders lack a fixed recipient. The current foreign powder is gradually softening, because a large amount of fixed powder has been loaded and transported en route, and if there are no obstacles, it will arrive at the port soon. Moreover, the fixed price of Australian powder is loosening, selling for only 15.3 yuan, although it has not been fixed, but people's hearts are depressed. The unified market selling price of Double Eagle brand is 19.1 yuan to 19 yuan, and the Triangle brand foreign powder is only sold for 18.5 yuan, and 300 to 400 bags were handled by this street.

The wheat market yesterday was still in a stalemate, because the supply and demand on the day were lacking, and there was absolutely no formal opening. It was heard that the Japanese mills were still quoting 21 yuan. Except for occasional scattered arrivals that were directly delivered to the mills, the amount transported to the concessions was increasingly lacking. Therefore, the market was as quiet as usual.

### Cotton Yarn, Turn Buying into Selling, Yarn Price Drops Suddenly

The yarn market, which has been firm and expensive for two months, is now gradually showing instability and a downward trend. This is because the quantity of thick and thin yarn handled by the Hong Kong brokers in the past was quite considerable. The brokers are temporarily full, or they need to wait for it to melt before purchasing again. At the same time, the bulls' pull is too strong. When encountering an unfavorable environment, the virtual wind is even worse. In addition, with the foreign exchange rising, and gold falling, those who generally regard cotton yarn as a standard have already changed their minds and tend to turn short. However, a large number of people are optimistic, but the sellers are frequently adding codes in the distant months, and the double-horse factory orders have fallen by more than 30 yuan.

The morning opening of the current yarn has already seen a dispersed momentum. In general, the bulls who have made profits are selling out. The first disk price of 20-count double-horse yarn is 1,265 yuan, slightly rising to 1,267 yuan. However, sellers and bulls who are closing positions are coming one after another. The general speculators see the wind and steer the rudder. For a time, the chips on the face are oversupplied, and the brokers' shouts are gradually going down, falling to 1,248 yuan. Some short positions cover and rebound to 1,255 yuan. This price has been circulating for a long time. Finally, with the sluggish sales, and the US dollar rising to 6 yuan, the exchange market has returned to a downward trend, and floating long positions are panic-stricken and reluctant to close. The market price has collapsed, falling straight to 1,230 yuan. It has been found that the transaction volume for half a day totaled 5,640 bags, and the price of 20-count double-horse yarn fell by 35 yuan. The amount of each seller's purchase is listed on the left.

Hong Kong 360, Peer 5,180, Total 5,640

Today, 3,190 pieces of cotton yarn were exported to Hong Kong, but yesterday, 139 pieces of cotton yarn were also transported from Hong Kong.

### Cotton Market Quiet

The current cotton situation is slightly weaker. This is because the yarn market has fallen, and the foreign exchange is frequently rising, resulting in a mediocre mentality. However, the industry's thinking is still relatively expensive, but the factory's needs are not strong, but mutual buying and selling are still not lacking. The market is already depressed. Today, 465 bales of cotton were transported to Hong Kong.

Foreign Cotton Market Price: The New York cotton market is quiet. Due to the lack of important buyers, and then due to the sale of Wall Street, the closing price fell by 3 pounds compared to the previous day. The Indian market is calm. Yesterday, including forecasts, there was not much fluctuation. The foreign cotton trading in Shanghai yesterday also turned slightly quieter. All parties are again turning to a wait-and-see attitude due to the sharp loosening of the exchange rate. Therefore, the market trading yesterday was also slightly quieter.

### Piece Goods, Yarn Price Falls, Cloth Price Plummets

Domestic Cloth: The market trend was soft yesterday, which was affected by the sharp drop in cotton yarn and Dongpi. The mentality of trading turned cold, but the sales of customers still had purchases, so the selling side frequently supported it. White goods, fine cloth, and twill were flat at noon, and the price of each piece of Erhua factory goods fell by 0.25 yuan per piece in the afternoon. Colored cloth and bleached cloth fell by 0.5 yuan. More than 200 pieces of coarse and fine cloth, colored cloth, and bleached cloth were handled by Zhejiang and Fujian brokers. More than 200 pieces of semi-finished blanks, bleached, and dyed cloths were completed in this street.

Eastern Cloth: The morning market was still flat, and the after-market plummeted, which was due to the violent drop in raw yarn, panic among retail investors, and speculative merchants took the opportunity to sell, resulting in a sharp drop of 1.5 yuan per piece for fine cloth and fine twill. The closing price of 12-pound Longtou fine cloth was 36.7 yuan, and the price of Four Gentlemen's Serge was 1.135 yuan, but there were absolutely no orders from foreign firms. The sales were still good, so the industry insiders remained calm.

Export Piece Goods: 3,250 pieces were transported to Hong Kong today.

### Securities, Foreign Exchange Loosening, Foreign Stocks Lost Progress - Domestic Debt Seen Weak Again -

The black market for securities, the trend yesterday was again slowly falling. Initially, Wuhua Datong and general retail investors bought in, and C-type saw 60 yuan again. Then, Hongda sold and returned slightly. Songmao Yitai bought not much. After the market price hovered slightly, it turned soft again. The noon closing fell by 0.3-0.4 yuan. After the initial opening in the afternoon, the multi-party pulled up again. Changren Renchang was buying in again, and general retail investors followed suit, and the price was raised by 0.3-0.4 yuan again. After entering, Jiufeng Lianhe Hongda had another sale and returned to 0.2-0.3 yuan again. The market price changed several times a day. As a result, except for E-type which was slightly better by 0.1 yuan, the rest returned by 0.2-0.3 yuan. The total number of transactions was about 1.2 to 1.3 million yuan. A brief summary table is listed below.

Stock Trading: Cotton Yarn Exchange shares traded 100 shares at a price of 42 yuan each.

The opening of the public stock market was sluggish. Subsequently, the market situation began to turn around due to the surge in the number of transactions in Jardine Matheson and Ho Beer stocks. The former's rise was due to rumors that it would announce dividends. Although the latter's sellers surged, the firm momentum was always maintained. The opening price in the early morning was 8 yuan. For a time, sellers flocked to it, immediately lowering the price to 7.6 yuan. At this price, someone tried hard to support it. The closing price was 7.75 yuan, with 177,000 shares traded. Due to the booming of the above two stocks, the remaining industrial stocks and rubber stocks were almost all ignored. The severe loosening of the exchange rate affected the progress of the stock market is not minor.

### Sugar Market, Foreign Sugar Transactions Quiet

Yesterday's sugar market trend was still flat and tired, and transactions were unusually quiet. The market price announced by the association, No. 14 raw white had no transactions, transshipment cargo was still 58 yuan, and Dutch red was seen soft at 55 yuan.

### Oil Market: Incessant Oil Supply, Flat and Weak Oil Prices

Yesterday's oil market experienced some fluctuations, but ultimately showed no significant gains or losses. However, futures prices were slightly lower than the market at the end of last week, dropping by about one yuan. Given the oversupply situation, the outlook remains weak. A total of 150 lots of Jiaozhou soybean oil were traded at 75 yuan. Twenty barrels of Qingdao soybean oil were traded at 99 yuan. One hundred dan of local factory soybean oil were traded at 85 yuan. Fifty lots of Yantai peanut oil for smoking were traded at 69.5 yuan. Additionally, 1,000 cans of tinned oil were traded at 97 yuan.

The latest arrivals are from Tong'an and Zhangzhou, potentially easing market prices.

### Medicinal Materials: Gardenia Seeds Rise by Six or Seven Yuan

Due to the recent lack of arrivals of small gardenia seeds, market inventory is gradually depleting. Although sales are sporadic, they are considered active, leading to a market upturn. Prices have increased by six or seven yuan compared to the previous period, with high-quality goods priced around 90 yuan.

### Coal: Borneo Coal Reduced in Price

Borneo bituminous coal had previously run out of stock, causing a temporary shortage in the market. Recently, it has been reported that a new batch of goods has arrived at the port.

### Teacher Zhang

— He Tianxing

The bell rang,
The children poured out like a tide,
The stairs sounded like a rainstorm,
The alleyways were filled with noise and laughter.

Some said,
"Goodbye, Teacher Zhang!"
Some said,
"Teacher Zhang, Xu Wenjin is stealing my things."
Some said,
"Teacher Zhang! Wang Guobao kicked my butt."

Teacher Zhang is their teacher,
Fifty years old this year,
In the school, apart from the "Principal,"
Teacher Zhang is the most hardworking.

Six hours of lessons every day,
From history to geography,
From Chinese to science.
Every time school ends,
Teacher Zhang is so tired he can't walk.

His pale hair
Is covered with a lot of chalk dust,
Making him look even more withered and old.

This year he also caught a cough—
Sometimes he couldn't breathe during class,
The children occasionally laughed when they saw it;
But when Teacher Zhang coughed out tears,
In the solemn atmosphere,
The children would also shed tears.

Teacher Zhang slowly came down the stairs,
Carrying a stack of compositions and exercise books.
The autumn wind blew on his thin shoulders;
Amidst the constant coughing,
He thought again:
Will I eat plain noodles tonight?
Or a bowl of thin porridge?

### I Want to Remain Silent

— Written by Chen Yanfan

Family

### I Am a Young Widow

— Yin Yang

Family corruption and emotional discord are the most painful things in life. I am a young widow suffering from pain, living a miserable life in a bad environment, which hurts my pure heart.

My father-in-law is the manager of a certain firm in Shanghai. He is very shrewd and casual. As the saying goes, "Not generous in big matters, but meticulous in small matters." His first wife bore him three daughters and divorced him unconditionally more than twenty years ago (it is said that she is still alive). His second wife gave birth to my husband and a younger sister before passing away. The current wife is said to be a senior hostess from a Tangzi 　[a kind of brothel], and has already given birth to two sons, both currently studying in primary and secondary schools.

Less than half a year after our marriage, the true colors of this "Third Wife" were revealed without any pretense. She was always looking for trouble and, through clever instigation, we often heard my father-in-law's harsh orders and suffered inhumane punishments, ultimately forcing father and son to live separately. Alas! It was extremely painful. Our loyal people were all her playthings.

Time flowed mercilessly, and more than two years passed quickly. Unfortunately, my husband gradually fell seriously ill due to daily depression and excessive labor. When the news reached home, it was only after the "persuasion" of relatives and elders that he was allowed to return home to recuperate. However, his illness worsened day by day, and even the doctor gave up hope. In the end, he painfully abandoned me and our five-month-old son and passed away. My heart was about to break, and my mind was confused. This was the biggest blow of my life, and the inner pain and oppression from evil forces gradually increased. Who could I turn to for comfort? I could only sob while holding my innocent and lovely child. The child grew slowly with each passing day, and it has been three years since my husband's death. The child can call out "Mom" clearly, but what about "Dad"? It's so pitiful. He is a child without a father, always at a disadvantage and always behind others.

All the extravagance is very common in the hands of the "Third Wife," but the scope is limited to her and her two sons. If relatives happen to visit, she will implement austerity and conservation movements. This is her consistent policy. Her arrogance is extreme, and she can often be heard saying: What does it matter what relatives and friends think? As long as I have money, I am not afraid of anything. She probably has forgotten what happened ten years ago, so none of the relatives are willing to see her unfriendly face. If they unfortunately arrive at this terrible home, she will show all kinds of different expressions: indifference, forced smiles, resentment, cowardice, fear… constantly changing.

The "Third Wife's" vicious methods cannot be fully described by my pen, so I can only bury them in my painful heart. My father-in-law's mind cannot be changed, and the family's fate has already been decided. Poor me, I can only patiently take on the responsibility left by my husband—nurturing my innocent child, breaking the corrupt practices of the old feudal system, and striving to rebuild a pure, happy, and fulfilling family.

Women

### Can or Should

— Quan

Before the Shanghai War, I also heard the high call for women's participation in politics. At that time, my younger sister had just graduated from a university and was working in a certain organization with a passionate hope. Her future was so bright! Unexpectedly, after the August 13th Incident, my sister stopped working and fled to the isolated island. Then she married Lu Jun. She originally planned to embark on a new journey together in the future. Who knew that after a year, my sister had completely changed. In a small family, she could not spare a moment from caring for her beloved son all day long. Her spirit and body gradually withered. One day, I asked her when she would go out into society, and she smiled bitterly, shook her head, and only said, "This hope now belongs to you."

With my sister's talent, she has a clear mind, rich knowledge, and a strong body. How could her efficiency in working in society be less than a man's? She should go out into society, but at present, my sister is burdened by her family; although she has lofty ambitions, she cannot be everywhere at once. Moreover, various institutions often restrict the recruitment of married women, as the recent postal recruitment is an example. Therefore, the core of the problem for women going out into society today lies in whether they can, not whether they should.

Essays

### The Long Gown

— Shou Niu

Scholars often wear long gowns, but wearing long gowns is inconvenient for labor, so people who wear long gowns do not labor, naturally forming the "upper class."

As the upper class gradually increased, people of the proletariat also wore long gowns, also bound by the long gowns, unable to labor. However, since there was no great task to do, then they had to tighten their belts and drink cold water, understanding themselves to be

Clothes are slaves of the Chu people, people are not slaves of clothes. They wear clothes for their bodies, not create a model for clothing. In case the environment is not as desired, if you simply take off the gown and make an accomodation, then that is a real man who can bend or stretch.

Huo Sang Detective Cases

### The Queen of Dance's Lodging

— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter Ten: The Shoe Problem

I was so pleasantly surprised that I didn't have time to speak. I hurriedly took out the soft ruler from my pocket and measured it against the sole of the shoe. It was indeed eleven inches and six.

I looked at Huo Sang and asked, "That's right, are these shoes Lu Jiansheng's?"

Huo Sang did not answer. His shining eyes were still fixed on the shoes. He also stroked the sole of the shoe with the fingertips of his left hand. He also whispered in surprise: "Bao Lang, you also touch it, the sole of this shoe is clearly not completely dry!"

I really followed his words and touched the sole of the shoe with my finger, and then nodded.

He said nervously: "Look carefully, what's the situation with the edges of the heel and the sole?... Nothing? You didn't look carefully. At first glance, the heel seems very clean, but in fact there are still some traces of mud, and they haven't been wiped clean. Look, there's still a lot of mud left in the needle stitches on the bottom edge."

I nodded as if understanding, and said: "In that case, someone wore these shoes last night, and then someone wiped the mud clean. Is that right?" Huo Sang said: "Yes, but it wasn't wiped very clean. This is called a hundred secrets, one slip. Also, look, there's mud on the tip of the shoelace. Do you understand where it came from?... What? Don't understand? That's easy to understand. Just because—"

"Bang!—Bang!"

Although the sound was transmitted through the glass window and wasn't too harsh, both Huo Sang and I could tell that it was the sound of a gun, definitely not any other sound. The source of the gunshot seemed to be right outside the door of this house. At this time, suddenly hearing this sound, of course Huo Sang could not think it was unrelated. He immediately put the shoes back in the wall cabinet, closed the wall cabinet door as before, and then beckoned to me and ran out of the room without saying a word. I also followed behind him. In an instant, Huo Sang had run down the stairs and out to the front door.

When I reached the bottom of the stairs, Jin Mei had also opened the door of the reception room and walked out in panic. She asked me, "Sir, what's the matter?"

I couldn't answer, but shook my head and continued to walk outside. When I stepped onto the cement path, I saw Huo Sang had already walked out of the iron gate with floral patterns. I looked to the left and right, and the outside of the gate was very quiet. Only one car was driving from the west, going towards the east. (150)

### Welcoming the Rebirth of Sino-German Domestically Produced Fashion Films

— Sun Ruojian

Nothing in the world is immutable. Take domestic films on the isolated island, for example. They cannot escape this law. In this particular time and place, due to the special environment, period dramas emerged in response to the times, while the original contemporary dramas almost completely disappeared. Some time ago, period dramas reached their peak. Now, it is said that contemporary dramas are about to sprout and grow again. In fact, it is telling us that "Qin Huai Shi Jia" by Jin Xing and "Tian Ya Ge Nu" by Guohua are already being filmed.

In the past, period dramas gave the audience a mixed impression: for example, "Li Xiang Jun," "Ge Neng Niang," "Mu Lan Cong Jun," "Liang Hong Yu"... because the themes were tragic and solemn, they were indeed more meaningful to the compatriots on the isolated island; others also promoted China's inherent virtues. In today's declining world, these are indeed worthy of our praise and promotion. However, on the other hand, there are indeed quite a few films that focus exclusively on narrow-minded love stories, mostly writing about "private betrothals in the back garden, and the young master in distress becomes the top scholar." Apart from serving as entertainment for women and children after tea and dinner, they have no other important content.

Because of the popularity of period dramas, filmmakers competed day and night to shoot them, creating the phenomenon of "crude production and poor quality" in the past. In terms of production, of course, there were no good results—even some films had light so dark that they were almost black, so that the characters on the screen were completely blurred; the sound recording was also terrible. These were indeed the most obvious bad consequences of the period drama craze.

Now, contemporary dramas have been "reborn" following period dramas. It is hoped that filmmakers will recognize that "movies are a form of public education" and shoulder the heavy responsibility of public education on the isolated island. For the "rebirth" of contemporary dramas, they must use the method of "eliminating the dross and preserving the essence"—allowing the meaningful themes in period dramas to remain in contemporary dramas—to accomplish this important mission. Don't just focus on business and crudely produce again and again, making mistakes over and over. Know that crude production is not only unprofitable but also creates a bad impression among the audience about your company's productions. This will simply lead to your own decline.

### The Public Harmonica Society's Tenth Anniversary Concert

— Xing Gu

The Public Harmonica Society is celebrating its tenth anniversary this year. On the evening of the 26th, a concert was held at Aurora University to raise funds for the society's instrument fund. The program was quite exciting. At the beginning, to show respect, Shi Renwang conducted the society's harmonica team and accordion team in playing the national anthem. After the performance, the entire audience stood up and sang the national anthem again.

Then, the "Silver Bell" prelude, with its loud and solemn music, gave the entire audience an uplifting emotion. The accordion quartet "Happy Family" waltz was quite pleasant to the ear.

After a five-minute break, the second part of the program began. Zhu Caijun's accordion duet "Cui Ti Chun Xiao" [Spring Dawn on the Emerald Bank], with its graceful and sweet sound, moved people's hearts. Shi Renwang's harmonica solo "The Merry Widow" used four harmonicas to play several different tunes, which was really pleasant to listen to. The song was very long. After the performance, the entire hall resounded with applause.

Next was Miss You Hailun's solo on the harmony instrument, the overture "Poet and Peasant". Miss Shi was graceful and beautiful, and she was able to perform this great masterpiece so wonderfully and seamlessly, without any clumsiness. It was truly rare. After the public joint team played "Mysterious Spain," the society presented two bugles to the Sino-French Boy Scouts in appreciation of their hard work in serving the public, and the band of the Sino-French Boy Scouts played the "Salute" tune on the spot to express their gratitude, which was quite interesting. Then, the Public Harmonica Society's anthem was sung, and the meeting ended.
