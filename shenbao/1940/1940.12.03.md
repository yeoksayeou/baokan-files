Central China Enlarged Memorial Week: Chairman Chiang Personally Gave Instructions, Offering Important Guidance on the Recent Situation

Chongqing, 2nd: At 8 a.m. on the 2nd, the Central Government held an enlarged Memorial Week for Dr. Sun Yat-sen. Chairman Chiang personally gave instructions, offering important guidance on the recent situation. The main points were: (1) First, he mentioned recent domestic and international events and officially announced that the Japanese invaders in central and northern Hubei had been completely defeated, with the Chinese army achieving a great victory. (2) He explained that the so-called treaty signed between Japan and Wang Jingwei was merely a public reiteration of the secret collusion between Japan and Wang that had already been established last year, as well as the fact that Japan sent Abe Nobuyuki to Nanjing in March of this year. There was nothing new or different about it. (3) He clarified that the Konoe Cabinet issued its so-called "Japan-Manchuria-China Joint Declaration" at the same time as the treaty was signed, intending to end the Sino-Japanese War. However, in reality, it would not only fail to end the Sino-Japanese War but would further prolong the conflict. (4) He refuted the rumors of Japan's peace offensive. (5) He expressed hope that everyone would recognize that this treaty was a complete manifestation of Japan's military and political failures. China would not suffer any losses but would only hasten the arrival of victory. Finally, he stated that the entire nation, military and civilians alike, should work harder and strive to complete their mission. (2nd dispatch)

### Japan's Policy Towards the Dutch East Indies Remains Unchanged; Ozawa's Mission

Tokyo: The Foreign Ministry spokesperson stated today while receiving newspaper reporters that Japan's policy toward the Dutch East Indies remained unchanged. Ozawa, the newly appointed representative to Batavia, would be responsible for harmonizing relations between the two countries. He was an experienced diplomat and politician, and his talks with the Dutch authorities would not be limited to the oil issue but would also cover many other issues related to the two countries. After Ozawa's appointment, Minister of Commerce Kobayashi would no longer need to serve as the representative for these talks, as the Diet would soon convene, and the Minister of Commerce would not have time to leave the country. The spokesperson continued by mentioning that when Japanese naval officer Sanjo arrived in Batavia by plane from Singapore on November 28th, the Dutch authorities refused him entry. He said that the Japanese government had not received formal information about this matter and that the local Japanese authorities had already negotiated with the Dutch authorities.

### After Japan Recognizes the Nanjing Regime, Germany Indicates That It Will Not Follow Suit; The Soviet Union Also Does Not Support It

Berlin: According to sources here, Germany is not currently considering recognizing the Nanjing "government." Although the signatory countries of the German-Italian-Japanese alliance maintain close relations with each other, the relations between the signatory countries and other countries are quite different. (Haitong News Agency dispatch on the 2nd)

Berlin: The German government spokesperson recently told foreign reporters at a press conference that although Japan had recognized the Jingwei "government," Germany did not necessarily have to follow suit. Germany would not recognize the "regime" at this time. Although the signatory countries of the tripartite alliance have close relations with each other, their opinions on relations with other countries still differ somewhat. Germany fully understands that Japan's recognition of the Nanjing regime is a diplomatic tactic, which, in the view of the Japanese, is conducive to resolving the situation in the Far East. (Associated Press dispatch on the 2nd)

Moscow: Although the Soviet Union has not published any comments on Japan's recognition of the Jingwei regime in newspapers, the simple telegrams about the matter from Tokyo yesterday are enough to show that the Soviet Union does not support this situation. Although the term "Nanjing Government" was used in the telegrams from Tokyo, commas were added to the word "government," and official radio telegrams still strongly support Chongqing's policy. The Soviet Union had previously issued a declaration stating that the Soviet Union would never recognize the Nanjing "government." This declaration was made by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov at the Supreme Soviet meeting on August 1st. At that time, Molotov also strongly emphasized the friendly relations between Moscow and Chongqing. Molotov stated that as for our relations with the great China, which is struggling for survival, good faith and friendship between the two countries have always existed since the conclusion of the Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact. (Associated Press dispatch on the 2nd)

London: The Times stated in an editorial today that Japan's recognition of the Nanjing regime would not have any impact on the situation in the Far East or on the attitudes of the major powers in the future. The newspaper believed that the Japan-Wang Treaty would not affect the British government's Far East policy. The British government had already expressed its attitude towards this treaty by lending money to the Chongqing government. Vichy France may act as Japan wishes, but the Soviet Union seems likely to maintain its freedom of action. (Reuter dispatch on the 2nd)

Tokyo: Japanese officials are now closely watching international reactions to the Japan-Wang Treaty. Japanese officials attach great importance to the fact that U.S. President Roosevelt announced a new loan of 50 million U.S. dollars to the Chongqing government and another 50 million U.S. dollars to support China's currency on the day the Japan-Wang Treaty was signed in Nanjing. According to Japanese newspapers, a telegram from London stated that British Foreign Secretary Halifax also met with Chinese Ambassador Guo Taiqi on the same day, offering him promises to support China's currency and continue supplying arms through the Burma Road. Japanese newspapers all stated that it was not surprising that Japan's enemies adopted this attitude, and it was not decisive. Japan will pay close attention to every step that Britain and the United States will take. Japan and the "Nanjing government" will take joint measures against third countries that adopt hostile attitudes and aid the Chongqing government. (Haitong dispatch on the 2nd)

Chairman Chiang Met with Reporters Yesterday; Reiterated His Expectations from Ten Months Ago; Believes That He Can Expedite the Realization of Those Expectations

Chongqing: After the Memorial Week ceremony on the morning of the 1st, Chairman Chiang met with reporters. When reporters asked how the Chairman viewed the recognition of the Wang Jingwei organization by Japan and the signing of a treaty with it in relation to friendly nations, the Chairman replied that he would like to take this opportunity to reiterate the letter to friendly nations that he issued on January 24th of this year: "I wish all friendly nations to pay close attention to the current situation in Japan. We deeply hope that the governments and peoples of all friendly nations will thoroughly understand Japan's full ambitions, the fundamental problems of the Pacific, and the common interests of all countries. If they do not act decisively now, it will be too late for regrets. Today, politicians from various countries can eliminate the endless disasters in the Pacific with a simple wave of their hands. If they abandon this path, then even with the lives of millions of people and the cost of trillions of dollars, they may not be able to avert this catastrophic disaster. Politicians from various countries, whether safeguarding the interests of their own countries or maintaining the culture, peace, and happiness of mankind, cannot escape their historical responsibilities for thousands of years to come. We especially hope that all friendly nations, regardless of whether their views and interests on European affairs are the same or different, have no contradictions or conflicts in today's situation in the Far East, and their goals are not different, and their interests are consistent. They should be open and honest, cooperate jointly, and quickly take effective action to deal with Japan." This is what I hoped for ten months ago. I believe that this expectation has now begun to be realized. I believe even more that this expectation will be realized sooner because of this decisive action. (2nd dispatch)

The U.S. Treasury Secretary Will Attend Congress to Answer Questions About the Reasons for Lending Money to China; George Adopts a Strong Far East Policy; The Distance Between the U.S. and Japan Is Extremely Far

Washington: Treasury Secretary Morgenthau is prepared to attend a joint meeting of the Banking and Currency Committees of both houses of Congress today to answer questions from isolationist members of Congress regarding the U.S. loan of $100 million to China and the U.S. purchase of tin, tungsten, and antimony worth $6 million from China. Chairman George of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee has also done his utmost to support the administration's loan policy and advocated that the U.S. government adopt a strong stance toward the Far East. George told an Associated Press reporter that he had participated in discussions before the loan to China was announced and fully supported the proposal. George stated, "We should assist China according to two guidelines: First, we should assist China to the best of our ability without hindering our national defense. Second, we should provide as much assistance as possible, choosing what is most beneficial to China." President Roosevelt announced on Saturday that the U.S. government had decided to provide $50 million to the Chinese government for general use. The President also stated that another $50 million would soon be allocated for currency protection and the management of Chinese and U.S. currencies, and the method was currently being discussed with the Congressional Appropriations Committee. The Senate may inquire whether Treasury Secretary Morgenthau's vast stabilization fund is being used as a tool for foreign policy. Senator Danaher, a Republican from Connecticut, stated that he wanted to know the specific purpose of the U.S. loan to China. He stated, "We want to know the purpose of these loans. I am afraid we will only know the truth when someone in the British Parliament makes a statement or General Chiang Kai-shek gives an interview to the press." Senate Majority Leader Barkley, a Democrat from Kentucky, stated that there was no reason to ask questions or make comments regarding the loan to China. He pointed out that the loan was implemented with the permission of congressional legislation. Senator Thomas, a Democrat from Utah, stated that the loan was a continuation of the U.S.'s past Far East policy. With this loan, China would be able to achieve its critical goals. He also stated that Secretary of State Hull's condemnation of the Japan-Wang "peace treaty" was sufficient to indicate that the distance between Japan and the U.S. was extremely far. (Associated Press dispatch on the 2nd)

Tokyo: Foreign Ministry spokesperson Suma stated today while receiving newspaper reporters that the details of the recent U.S. announcement of financial assistance to China had been published by President Roosevelt in a press release. This loan may bring indirect benefits to Japanese businesses in China. The U.S. government's attitude toward Japan was a result of Japan's recognition of the Nanjing Wang Jingwei regime, which the Japanese government had anticipated long ago. However, the issue of plans to counter this new loan would be decided by the Nanjing authorities, and Tokyo had nothing to say. Suma also emphasized that the main effect of the new development was psychological, and politics was secondary. Furthermore, the new loan was stated to be for the purpose of stabilizing China's legal currency, which was very noteworthy. Suma also emphatically stated that Song Ziwen's trip to the U.S. was said to be specifically for negotiating this new loan. Song had been in the U.S. for a long time without returning. Therefore, Japan had long expected that the U.S. would take this action. (Reuter dispatch on the 2nd)

### The Situation Between Vietnam and Thailand Is Tense; Hope for Peace Has Not Been Abandoned; The New French Envoy Is Conducting Negotiations; Air Combat Occurred on the Upper Mekong River

Hanoi: Authoritative sources declared today that the air forces of French Vietnam and Thailand engaged in 20 minutes of air combat yesterday above Taiji Village on the upper Mekong River. At the same time, the French army took retaliatory actions in response to Thailand's bombing of Vietnam on December 28th and 30th. Details of the air combat and retaliatory actions are not yet known. The situation between the two countries is very tense, but diplomatic relations between the two sides have not yet been severed, as the Thai Consul remains in Saigon, and the newly appointed French envoy to Bangkok, Garo, is conducting negotiations to resolve all recent border disputes. Hanoi authorities believe that the situation is now extremely serious, but there is still hope for peace. Hanoi has made all preparations for war. Major cities in southern Vietnam have uniformly implemented light control at night. Families of French personnel have received orders to evacuate the border, while French officials remain at the border to work. (Taiwan News Agency dispatch on the 2nd)

Hanoi: Border conflicts between Thailand and Vietnam continue. A ray of hope has appeared for resolving the situation diplomatically between the two countries. It is reported that the French took strong retaliatory measures on Sunday, the details of which are still unknown. However, authorities announced tonight that the indigenous unrest in Cochinchina has not yet been quelled, but the northern border of Tokyo has become peaceful. Yesterday, several Thai aircraft attempted to attack a French ship named the Bailil near Gon Island in the Gulf of Siam. The Thai aircraft dropped nine bombs, but none hit. Two Thai aircraft then flew elsewhere to bomb, while the Bailil ship responded with machine guns and cannons, and the aircraft fled. One Thai aircraft was damaged. Thai troops have occupied the undefended Pan Tong Island, one of eleven islands on the Mekong River, 56 kilometers from the capital of Laos. Although Thai-Vietnamese traffic has been threatened, authoritative sources believe that the French envoy to Thailand, Karu, is still attempting to negotiate with the Thai authorities in Bangkok to find a solution. (Associated Press dispatch on the 2nd)

Vichy: This place has just received an official telegram from Saigon stating that Thai troops have invaded twice in one week. From 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. on Thursday, Thai aircraft bombed the Vietnamese border cities of Taek and Savannakhet for two hours, killing and wounding many people. The two attacked cities are the largest cities along the Mekong River in Laos. The area was not included in Thailand's demand for islands in the Mekong River. The aircraft that attacked the two cities were American-made and believed to have taken off from the Kora base. Before the Saigon telegram arrived, this place had already heard a Singapore radio announcement that French aircraft had bombed a Thai border city. However, the French government issued a statement today denying that French aircraft had attacked Thai territory, insisting that only Thai aircraft had carried out bombings during the war. The French government also warned Thailand that although France had not retaliated against the bombing, the Governor-General of Vietnam had taken necessary measures to prevent future air strikes on the western border. (Associated Press dispatch on the 2nd)

Vichy: Diplomatic and official circles here believed last night that the Thai government's publication of its first war report was a sign of serious developments in the Thai-Vietnamese conflict. (Haitong News Agency dispatch on the 2nd)

Bangkok: The high command here announced today that Thai troops had repelled French troops attempting to attack Taylor in southern Thailand yesterday. It also stated that there were no Thai casualties. The command continued that French aircraft had continuously invaded Thai airspace on Saturday and Sunday. (Associated Press dispatch on the 2nd)

Bangkok: Thai Prime Minister Songkhram recently announced that Thai aircraft had bombed the border town of Phetchabun of Laos the previous day, stating that ten bombs had directly hit French anti-aircraft guns and French troops. (Associated Press dispatch on the 2nd)

London: According to a communiqué issued in Bangkok, Thai troops yesterday attacked French troops in the south, and it was said that one French aircraft had entered Thai territory yesterday. (Reuter dispatch on the 2nd)

Editorial

### Glimpsing the Future

Amid the perilous situation in the Far East, the document crafted by Wang Jingwei and Abe Nobuyuki has recently emerged. This newspaper has already analyzed its nature yesterday. Now, let us, from an objective perspective, glimpse its future.

First, examining its name and seeking its veracity, what possibilities exist for it to benefit the nation? The formal statement issued by Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui, as reported by the Chongqing dispatch, clarifies the international legal status of the Abe-Wang document. However, matters pertaining to legal principles, ethical considerations, or political implications are not what we intend to reiterate today. We shall scrutinize the document itself, seeking its merit. Foremost is the matter of examining its name and seeking its veracity. This is not merely a question of whether the name is righteous or unrighteous, but rather, based on the "name" within the document, we seek its permissible "reality." Among these, the most crucial is the concept of "nation." Any "nation" must possess the absolute elements of popular sovereignty and territory, without any ambiguity. The people are not slaves, and slaves are not people. The distinction lies in the existence, foundation, and guarantee of human rights and civil rights, which need not be elaborated. Sovereignty is the supreme right possessed by a nation, independent and free to exercise, unrestricted and uncompromised. If restricted and compromised by foreign powers, it cannot be considered sovereignty, and therefore, not a nation. The territory must have clear boundaries, meaning that it is not restricted or compromised by foreign powers and is under the independent and free exercise of sovereignty for the great defense of its boundaries. From these three points, regardless of the situation in the Japanese-occupied areas of China before the Abe-Wang document, at least, based on the content and clauses stipulated in the Abe-Wang document, it is known that under this document, it is impossible to create a nation that lives up to its name. The original attempt to resolve the issues between China and Japan through methods and means such as the Abe-Wang document has inherent impossibilities beyond its intended scope. However, one might question: what if the Abe-Wang document creates a new nation that is fully equipped with proper organs and functions? Now, the document answers "No!"

Second, being pragmatic and realistic, what possibilities exist for improving the current reality? The so-called reality is that China has this region, now under Japanese military occupation. The so-called improvement is to alleviate or eliminate the suffering within this region. Due to factual limitations, we do not advocate lofty rhetoric of ceasing hostilities, nor do we entertain extravagant hopes of a comprehensive solution. We only seek what is practically achievable within the scope of the Abe-Wang document. Perhaps this is indeed a pragmatic and realistic attitude. Fundamentally, in war, in a war of national liberation, suffering caused by the ravages of war and sacrifices made for the war are not unexpected, and there is no cause for resentment. It is superfluous to discuss alleviating or eliminating suffering while the war is not yet over. However, suffering is ultimately a worthwhile topic to discuss. Now, in this document, there is a "understanding of the need for Japan to take necessary measures to achieve the above-mentioned war aims." After the document, Tokyo reiterated that the issue of withdrawing troops was out of the question. It is evident that the state of military occupation will not only not end because of this document, but is further recognized by the document as necessary for its measures. In other words, the suffering under military occupation remains intertwined with the state of war, and therefore, alleviation and elimination are out of the question. Unless it is said that all or part of the current suffering is due to unnecessary measures taken by the Japanese army in the past, which will now be corrected, and therefore part or all of the suffering will be alleviated or eliminated. However, can the Japanese army admit that some or all of the measures taken in the past were unnecessary? Furthermore, what the Japanese side does in the occupied areas is a two-pronged approach of military and economic offensives, meaning that the occupied areas of China are actually under double pressure. But now, in this document, the necessity of military measures is recognized, and the economic offensive is strengthened by layers of overlapping clauses. In other words, this document not only fails to bring about the withdrawal of Japanese military actions, but also accepts acts of economic aggression. It not only cannot alleviate or eliminate the suffering under military occupation, but also cannot break free from economic shackles. As for culture, it fundamentally exceeds the practical and realistic boundaries of the war period and does not need to be mentioned. Praise and criticism, attacks and defenses, are all impractical and unhelpful subjective views! But seeking within the document, where can we find even the slightest hope of improving the current reality?

The above two points, within the actual scope of the Abe-Wang document, glimpse its future. Even if we numb all our other senses, and only strive for compromise and maintaining the status quo, we can still find the depths, we can ponder, we can imagine, but heavy with sorrowful hearts, we can only feel its emptiness, we can only sigh for it. However, when we try to observe it outside the actual scope of the document, we find that this document is not equal to waste paper. How so? (1) Although Japan's rampant ambitions and actions have long been judged by world opinion, we still have some remaining notions that one day the Japanese may regain their reason and abandon their ambitions to invade China. Now, this document shows that the possibility of Japan changing its mind is almost exhausted. (2) Although China's determination to resist and build has long been trusted internally and externally, it is assumed that Japan may propose conditions to the National Government that China can accept, or give any Chinese the opportunity to create an independent and free nation with complete sovereignty. Now, this document allows China to realize even more deeply that only by fighting the war to the end will it obtain a final solution. (3) Although the friendship of the United States and the Soviet Union towards China has long been proven by facts, will the United States assume that the past damage is irreparable, silently endure these things, and stop aiding China? Will the Soviet Union assume that Japan is now determined to move south and no longer hostile to the Soviet Union, and stop aiding China under these conditions? Now, this document has accelerated the establishment of new U.S. loans to China, explaining that the United States confirms that continuing to intensify aid to China is inevitably effective. Moreover, the troops stationed in Mongolia and northern China are clearly aimed at the Soviet Union, also explaining that moving south is by no means abandoning the move north. In short, this document, although in its own political significance it can be regarded as empty, its external influence has enabled many parties to obtain new evidence that the future cannot be resolved without military force.

### Mexico's New President's Declaration: Supports the Pan-American Defense Plan, Maintains Domestic Unity Through Labor-Management Cooperation, Builds Naval Bases, and Strives to Increase Production

Mexico City - General Manuel Ávila Camacho, the new President of Mexico, was inaugurated on the 1st in a grand ceremony. He immediately declared that the new government is determined to support the Pan-American defense plan and preserve democratic institutions. It will also maintain domestic unity through cooperation between labor and management. The inauguration ceremony was held in the Congress Hall, with representatives from thirty foreign countries in attendance. The new President's inaugural address was relatively simple. Several thousand armed farmers and workers were stationed in the central square in front of the Presidential Palace to assist the regular army in maintaining order, preventing disturbances from supporters of the defeated presidential candidate, General Almazán. The next Vice President of the United States, Henry Wallace, served as a special envoy of President Roosevelt. When he entered the hall, the entire audience stood up and cheered. General Camacho was sworn in at 11:05 AM, and outgoing President Lázaro Cárdenas handed him a tricolor sash of red, white, and green. The new President's inaugural address implied a shift from the extreme left-leaning tendencies of the previous president towards a more moderate approach. It explicitly expressed a willingness to cooperate with foreign capital. Camacho did not mention the oil company dispute. However, he also stated that Mexico hopes to base its economic development on its own efforts. The main points of his speech were roughly as follows: (1) Mexico will build its own naval bases to contribute to Pan-American defense. (2) Unify national defense affairs and improve the economic conditions of farmers and workers. (3) Mexico must respond to the current world situation and increase production through a private capital system to achieve prosperity. (4) Investors must be given incentives for legitimate profits. (5) Warn the military not to interfere in politics. (6) Call for national unity. American observers here believe that the new President's policies on national defense and labor-management cooperation will be extremely beneficial to future US-Mexico relations. (United Press dispatch, 2nd)

### Argentina Negotiates with the United States: Foreign Minister Admits It

Buenos Aires - Foreign Minister Roca announced yesterday that the Argentine government is currently conducting negotiations with the United States on military matters. This was due to the Uruguayan Minister of Defense announcing in the country's House of Representatives that there are currently two representatives of the US government negotiating with the Argentine government. Roca had no choice but to acknowledge it, stating that US Colonel Cristen has been here for some time and is currently exchanging views with Argentina regarding the US proposed continental defense plan. To ease rumors from all sides, Roca specifically stated that the exchange of views between US and Argentine representatives did not impose any obligations on Argentina. The negotiations were held in early November, and there has been no further discussion of the US establishing bases in Argentina. The content of the negotiations was purely informational in nature. (Havas-Tung She News Agency dispatch, 2nd)

### Paraguayan President Implements Dictatorship

Buenos Aires - After President Higinio Morínigo took power in Paraguay, he issued a declaration yesterday stating that he, based on the nation's constitution, has taken over the presidential powers. The Uruguayan people and army are now under unified command to jointly realize the goals of the Uruguayan revolution. The Uruguayan revolution is entirely based on Christian principles. Therefore, the rights of mankind must always be guaranteed. He will strive for the welfare of the people. We must move forward along this path. The government's responsibility is to enrich the country and strengthen the people. (Havas-Tung She News Agency dispatch, 3rd)

### Stark Advocates Building a Strong Navy to Connect Both Oceans and Respond to New Threats: Over a Hundred US Navy Officers Promoted

Washington - Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Harold R. Stark officially stated in his annual report yesterday that the United States will have 15,000 naval aircraft, 32 battleships, and many other powerful fleets upon completion of the current construction program. Admiral Stark said, "The current US fleet is the strongest of any single country in the world, but it is still insufficient to cope with the global situation. The new threats in the Western Hemisphere have attracted the attention of the American people because the future security in that area has become a problem." The report stated, "We are now making all kinds of preparations to increase our existing strength to cope with events. If we want to prevent enemies from attacking in the Western Hemisphere, we must ensure that our naval power can reach the Atlantic Ocean in the east and the Pacific Ocean in the west." Admiral Stark also said, "Therefore, we now need a large number of long-range bases. We should maintain and develop our bases in overseas territories to meet needs, whether it is Puerto Rico, Hawaii, or Guam." The Admiral also said that in addition to aircraft and battleships, the United States will also have 185 submarines, 325 destroyers, 91 cruisers, and 18 aircraft carriers. The greatest goal is to ensure that the United States is able to operate in both oceans simultaneously when necessary. Admiral Stark continued, "Without this naval strength, it is difficult to guarantee national security in the current situation." (United Press dispatch, 2nd)

### New Japanese Ambassador to the US, Nomura, Speaks: Plans to Arrive in the US at the End of the Year to Assume Office, Deeply Aware of the Arduous Task

Tokyo - The newly appointed Japanese Ambassador to the United States, Kichisaburō Nomura, recently had a special interview with a reporter from the Taiwan Nichinichi Shinpo. Nomura's words focused heavily on the arduous and difficult nature of his future mission. Reportedly, he is deeply aware of the fundamental differences and conflicts in policies between the US and Japan, which could easily trigger dangers between the two nations. However, he firmly believes that any issue between the US and Japan can be resolved through political means and time. Nomura stated that he has served in the Navy for many years and lacks experience in diplomacy. He originally felt that he was not competent for the position of Ambassador to the United States. However, due to the strong urging of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, he had no choice but to agree to take on the role. War between the US and Japan, regardless of who wins or loses in the first phase, would be a catastrophe for world civilization. Therefore, those who are defeated in the war will constantly seek revenge, making the Pacific Ocean perpetually unstable.

The Tripartite Pact is Equivalent to Scrap Paper

When the reporter asked how he would explain that the Tripartite Pact is not a tool against the US, he replied that he had not yet received instructions from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. However, he personally believed that the pact did not pose a risk of war between the US and Japan. First, the US is already practically united with Great Britain, providing substantial assistance to Great Britain and intensifying its assistance. However, it is not necessary to formally participate in the war. In this situation, Japan has no need to invoke the Tripartite Pact. Second, although the pact stipulates that if one of the three countries is attacked by another country, the signatory countries should provide economic and military assistance, this does not bind Japan to participate in the war unconditionally. For example, the Greek war occurred after the pact was signed, and Japan did not have to join the fighting.

The Problem of Banning Trade with Third Countries

When the reporter asked about the ban on trade with third countries in the Japanese-occupied areas of China, Nomura replied that Japan is fighting China for its survival. The critical situation has prompted the military to take measures such as blockading certain areas and controlling prices, finance, and trade. He said that he hopes the United States can understand the difficulties they have experienced in the past three years, which are temporary. When the crisis ends, this matter can be improved. He said that he could not accurately understand why foreign ships were still prohibited from navigating the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. When he was Foreign Minister, he made this guarantee to US Ambassador Grew on December 18, 1939, saying that the Yangtze River would be opened soon. Ambassador Nomura also said that he believes that changes in the situation in that area and other places have made it necessary to re-examine this issue, and the decision to open the river is not yet timely.

Expresses Regret Over US Aid to China

In the conversation, Nomura mentioned the dangers to peace in the Pacific, which he attributed to the continued moral and material assistance the United States is providing to the Chinese government in Chongqing. He said that this is deeply regrettable to the Japanese people. The Japanese people believe that the United States is a major obstacle to "Japanese peace" in East Asia. He asked, "Why is the United States interfering in a victory that is extremely important to Japan's security and prosperity, fighting a war far from the British mainland?" In response to this question, the reporter cited the US statement on its interests in China and briefly mentioned the comments of some American businessmen regarding the damage they have suffered from the Japanese in their business in China. The explanation for US aid to China is that the United States believes that the result of Japan's efforts to create a "New Order" has been more damaging to their interests in China than under the old order. When Ambassador Nomura's appointment was announced, people here were very pleased. There were rumors that Nomura finally accepted the position because of consultations with Foreign Minister Matsuoka. Matsuoka and Nomura have reportedly agreed on a new approach to diplomacy with the US that could reduce tensions between the two countries. If this is true, Nomura must remain tight-lipped. Judging from Nomura's entire conversation, it seems that he is about to take on an arduous task and does not have any secret weapons of a fatherly nature to assist him. Ambassador Nomura's term of office is expected to begin at the end of December. Those who visited Ambassador Nomura today were Taiwan Nichinichi Shinpo Tokyo President Thompson and two reporters.

own safety, prosperity is extremely important?" When answering this question, the reporter cited the American statement on its rights in China, and briefly mentioned the comments of ten American businessmen regarding the destruction of their business in China by the Japanese. As for the explanation of American assistance to China, that is, the Americans viewed it as a result of Japan's attempt to create a "new order", their rights in China being more heavily damaged than they were under the old order. As Ambassador Nomura's appointment was announced, the people here were very pleased. There was much speculation that Nomura finally accepted this position as a result of consultation with Foreign Minister Matsuoka, and Matsuoka and Nomura have already decided upon a new diplomatic strategy towards the U.S., one that can greatly lessen tensions between the two countries. If this statement holds true, Nomura would have to remain secretive about it. Viewing Nomura's entire conversation, it seems like he will embark on a difficult journey, and there are no secret weapons of paternalistic character assisting him. Ambassador Nomura's departure date is expected to be at the end of December. Today, the people who visited Ambassador Nomura were Taiwan Daily News' Tokyo President Thomson and two reporters.

### Italian Troops Reinforce Mountain Positions, Greek Forces Approach Albanian Capital, Both Sides Contest the Epirus Mountain Passes, Italian Forces Retreat to Central Albania

Athens - According to reports, Italian commanders yesterday rushed large numbers of reinforcements to the Italian positions in the mountains north of Pogradec (within Albania), attempting to stop the Greek advance. Greek forces have now reached the main road to Tirana, the Albanian capital, with the front line only 45 miles away. Official reports state that Greek forces occupied Pogradec after the fiercest battle. This occupation not only provides a launching point for attacking Tirana, the Albanian capital, but also strengthens the defenses of Korçë, a previously held Italian stronghold. Italian prisoners of war confessed that the battle for Pogradec was extremely fierce, with both armies fighting with bayonets. The streets along Lake Ohrid were covered with corpses. At night, Greek forces surrounded the Italian army, and the bayonet fighting became even more intense. Greek forces set fires, causing the Italian army to be at a loss and ultimately surrender. Other reports indicate that Greek forces disguised as civilians were disrupting traffic behind Italian lines in Albania, with great effectiveness. In order to prevent large-scale Italian counterattacks, Greek forces are now using all their strength to attack by land, sea, and air. Currently, both countries are committing large numbers of personnel, supplies, and machines to the front lines to fight for important mountain passes in the Epirus region. These mountain passes control the southern Albanian battlefield. (United Press dispatch, 2nd)

Belgrade - According to border reports, after Greek forces captured Pogradec, the Italian army's base in central Albania, the Italian army retreated to central Albania in knee-deep snow and under brutal aerial bombardment.

Greek radio reported that Greek forces had advanced to a point opposite the island of Corfu. News from Struga on the southern Yugoslav border indicated that Greek forces had occupied several peaks controlling the Qafë Thanë mountain pass on the northern shore of Lake Ohrid after three hours of fierce fighting, with the mountains covered in injured soldiers and corpses, numbering up to 8,000 people. From this point on, Greek forces can launch an attack from the mountain fortress, attacking Kavajë (an important highway to Elbasan). The first step is to capture Kavajë, and the second step is to attack Elbasan to the north, which is only twenty miles from Tirana, the Albanian capital. (United Press dispatch, 2nd)

London - According to an Athens radio broadcast, last night's Greek communique stated that Greek forces continued to advance along the entire front line and had captured particularly important strongholds, which can be used to launch future operations.

Also, Athens radio reported that the secretary general of the Fascist Party is now taking harsh measures in Albania to suppress the anti-Italian movement. It is reported that the anti-Italian movement was initiated by Albanian youth. Students at many schools tore down images of Mussolini on the walls and sang the Albanian national anthem, which was banned by the Italians. It is reported that the Italians have therefore ordered all schools in Albania to be closed. (Reuters dispatch, 2nd)

### German Planes Heavily Attack Southern England; Southampton Suffers Severe Damage

London, Yesterday evening and early this morning, German planes again launched large-scale bombing raids across various areas of the British Isles. Southampton suffered another fierce attack. Over the past 72 hours, the city has been in constant terror. In the past few weeks, the German side has apparently adopted a new tactic, forcing the British to concentrate their main air defense forces in London, then slightly easing the offensive against the British capital, and starting group air raids on various central locations spread across the islands. After being bombed last night, Southampton is said to have become a terrifying ruin, no different from Rotterdam. Liverpool, East Anglia, the Midlands, and the southwest coast also suffered large-scale heavy bombing. German planes approaching London last night were driven back several times by British fighters before they could reach the center of London. At the same time, it is reported that British air force also launched fierce counter-attacks last night against German airfields and islands off the coast within French and Belgian territory. According to Dover, the sound of explosions along the French Strait coast was clearly audible. (2nd International Telegram)

London, Yesterday, only small squadrons of enemy fighter planes and fighter-bombers were active in the British skies, and none penetrated the southern suburbs of London. Two enemy planes were shot down. (2nd Reuters Telegram)

Berlin, Last night, when German reconnaissance planes flew over southern England, they saw many fires burning in Southampton, with thick smoke stretching towards the Strait. Based on observations, it is clear that the bombing on Saturday night caused extensive damage to the city. Due to weak anti-aircraft fire, German planes were able to attack at low altitude. (2nd Haitong Telegram)

Berlin, According to information obtained from the German military headquarters last night, the large fires caused by numerous incendiary and explosive bombs when German planes attacked Southampton, England, on Saturday night were so intense that British firefighters were unable to stop the spread of the flames. The destruction of the city's waterworks made the firefighters' work even more difficult and complicated. Until yesterday morning, the fire became even more terrifying, with black smoke rising from the city stretching towards the Strait, visible even from Cherbourg in France. It is speculated that the large amount of food stored in the city, intended for supply to London, has been destroyed. Yesterday, German reconnaissance planes confirmed that the city's radio factory was also damaged in the bombing. (2nd Haitong Telegram)

### Large British Fleet Concentrated at Gibraltar; Canal Bridge Completed

Algeciras, The British fleet at Gibraltar currently consists of two battleships, one aircraft carrier, cruisers, submarines, and numerous auxiliary ships. Yesterday, several British planes circled over the port for several hours. Prior to this, an aircraft of unknown nationality appeared and flew towards the Strait. British anti-aircraft guns fired for ten minutes, but without a hit.

### Mediterranean Sea: British-Italian Naval Battle; Tripoli Attacked from the Air

On board a British warship in the Mediterranean, November 26th. A reporter witnessed the British fleet routinely sweeping the eastern and central Mediterranean, dispatching an air squadron to attack the port of Tripoli in Italian Libya. First, a British aircraft carrier released small, illuminated balloons to measure wind direction. Then, in the dim moonlight, bombers fully loaded with bombs took off one after another and disappeared into the darkness. Everyone on the ship stared intently at the coast. After a short while, the distant horizon was suddenly illuminated by anti-aircraft shells and the flashes of explosions as British planes dropped their bombs. Upon completion of their mission, the British pilots returned to the ship and reported that large and small bombs had hit their targets. Docks, warehouses, and ships were all heavily damaged. Three bombs hit one ship, causing a fire, and several other locations were also burning fiercely. The British fleet sailed 60 miles away and could still see the raging fire. Other British warships patrolled the eastern and central Mediterranean, searching for the Italian fleet, while British escort convoys traveled back and forth continuously. The Italian claim that the Mediterranean is controlled by Italy is becoming increasingly clear as empty boasting. Over twenty Italian submarines have been sunk beneath the sea, and many Italian planes have been destroyed in the air. Their fighter squadrons have also been broken up, so the British can transport soldiers and supplies unhindered on this vital route. The reporter briefly glimpsed Souda Bay and the small white town at the foot of the mountains, its peaceful atmosphere shattered by four bombs dropped by an enemy plane flying very high. However, all four bombs fell into the sea, causing no material damage. The attacking enemy plane escaped into the clouds. The reporter and others passed by a British destroyer sweeping for mines. In the afternoon, the ship's anti-aircraft gunners spotted an enemy plane and immediately opened fire, driving it away. That night, British naval aircraft attacked Tripoli, waiting for retaliatory action from the Italian side, but there was no response. Two days later, information was received that the Italian fleet had sailed into the sea, so the British fleet patiently awaited news of the Italian fleet's location. Soon, it was learned that the British fleet led by Sir Somerville had made distant contact with the Italian fleet, and the enemy fleet had fled back to its home port in a panic. The fleet the reporter was with was too far away to join the chase, much to his regret, and continued its usual mission. (2nd Reuters Telegram)

### German War Report

Berlin, According to the German High Command, the German Air Force continued to attack Southampton late the day before yesterday, dropping many heavy bombs.

Several British planes attacked the German coast from the North Sea at dawn, bombing residential areas, and several civilians were injured. Yesterday, German fighter planes shot down eleven British planes in southern England. Two German planes were lost. (2nd Haitong Telegram)

### British Authorities Seek to Inspire the Public

London, As winter approaches, London is gradually showing signs of apathy. Observers can already see signs of excessive complacency and overconfidence, similar to what was seen in France last winter. The difference is that morale in Britain is gradually declining, while only a part of the military is affected. Well-informed sources reveal that the British government is now studying tough measures to deal with some minor problems. These minor problems may not be a major crisis, but a single spark can start a prairie fire, so preventive measures must be taken. The same sources also say that Britain must have a sufficient public, with the spirit of the British, to resist those who neglect their duties in order to win victory. It is said that more stringent new methods for dealing with those who are negligent have been drafted, and people in the upper and middle classes are paying attention. It is widely believed that the government is considering the use of emergency powers. Although the government abhors these emergency powers, the increasingly powerful operations of totalitarian states make the use of emergency powers to counter them seem increasingly necessary. The same sources explained that this is not a question of dictatorship, nor is it a question of morale declining due to hunger, but a question of ensuring that Britain has a fully operational spirit by next spring. It is reported that British officials are now giving speeches in various regions to inspire the public and prevent the growth of complacency. According to the aforementioned well-informed sources, the new methods being considered include the following: (1) Increasing tax rates, especially for those with huge assets, to meet the requests made by the two parties to use all wealth; (2) Systematically evacuating the residents of various cities who have been made homeless by bombing, so that they can resettle, as bombed cities are now overcrowded and refugees are in dire straits; (3) Expanding the army, including conscripting those who neglect their duties and foreigners; (4) Curbing the trend of inflation and controlling the increase in the cost of living; (5) Punishing those who monopolize and profiteer; (6) Requiring the unemployed to work, and damaged houses to be repaired quickly.

### Romanian Prime Minister Announces Determination to Recover Lost Territory from Hungary; Calls on Iron Guard to Obey Government; Large Numbers of Romanian Refugees Flee into Bulgaria

Bucharest, Yesterday, Romanian Prime Minister Antonescu attended the 22nd anniversary of Romania's annexation of Outer Transylvania in Alba Iulia. He addressed 100,000 members of the Iron Guard and other spectators, demanding that members of the Iron Guard obey the government and warning Hungary that Romania is determined to recover the lost territory of Outer Transylvania and will never abandon its claim to 20,000 square miles of land. (According to sources in Budapest, Hungary, the Hungarian government may issue a formal warning about this. The Romanian Prime Minister's speech seems to be an attempt to divert domestic attention to foreign affairs in order to consolidate Antonescu's regime.) Antonescu also warned members of the Iron Guard not to take improper extreme actions, saying, "I have shared hardships with you. Now it is my duty to demand your obedience." The government now believes that all the Iron Guard murderers who shot 64 political leaders have committed suicide, and says that no members of the Iron Guard have been arrested or committed suicide. (2nd United Press Telegram)

Budapest, News from the border reports that hundreds of Romanian refugees, men, women, and children, fleeing the chaos caused by the Iron Guard, abandoned their homes last night and early this morning, navigating crowded small boats, dodging east and west, stealthily crossing the Danube and fleeing into Bulgaria. It is reported that the refugees arriving at the Bulgarian border said that many people were captured while fleeing through the valleys, and some drowned in the swift currents of the Danube while crossing the river. Most of those who were lucky enough to save their lives were protected by the darkness. The Bulgarian authorities have taken in these penniless and long-unfed refugees. Most of the refugees are government officials, family members of officials, including some Jews. At the same time, it is also reported that the assassination of former Romanian Prime Minister Gigurtu has been partially confirmed. It is said that Gigurtu and a former cabinet member were detained by the Romanian regular army in the Romanian Interior Ministry building in Bucharest. Members of the Iron Guard seized the two men from the soldiers guarding the building and killed them immediately. The whereabouts of King Michael are still unknown, and he must be hiding in a remote mountain area, protected by German troops. It is rumored that new incidents will occur in Constanța, Călărași, and Ploiești. (2nd International News Agency Telegram)

### Axis Powers to Launch Second Phase of Diplomatic Offensive; Unite France and the Balkans

Capital of a Southern Country, Newspapers in Yugoslavia yesterday carried reports from Berlin correspondents saying that the Axis powers will launch a second phase of diplomatic offensive to consolidate the political situation in Europe. The first phase of the diplomatic offensive, since Romania, Hungary, and Slovakia joined the Tripartite Pact of Germany, Italy, and Japan, has now come to an end. The correspondents' reports all hinted that the main purpose of the second phase is to unite relations between France and the Balkans. "Vreme" reported that Yugoslavia's policy of avoiding involvement in the war completely meets the wishes of Germany and Italy. Yugoslavia should continue to promote relations with Bulgaria and seek a thorough understanding of Bulgaria's situation in the Balkans. The newspaper continued that Yugoslavia deeply hopes that the Italian-Greek war will not spread to other countries in the Balkans, and hopes to maintain friendly relations with Hungary. Yugoslavia does not oppose the new European order planned by the Axis powers, and is willing to adjust its national policies to adapt to the European situation and the political trends in Europe.

### National Day of Yugoslavia; Speech by Prince Paul

Capital of a Southern Country, Prince Paul, Regent of Yugoslavia, delivered a broadcast speech last night on the National Day of Yugoslavia, which was broadcast throughout the country.

Our country should remain calm, keep the country from being involved in war, promote a policy of peace, and respect our neighbors who respect our country's sovereignty and independence. Maintaining the country's neutrality is extremely difficult, but it is still essential to pursue our policy of peace and defend the country's security. I am very excited about the national people's support for the king's spirit of sacrificing for the country. The national consciousness shown by the people of the country is even more inspiring to me. I deeply believe that if we are united, we will surely be able to overcome the difficulties ahead and save the country from the disaster of war. Paul then ended his speech by cheering the king.

If Britain could occupy Syria, then the side of Britain's communications from the Mediterranean to India would be safe.

London, According to German radio, the new German destroyer fleet, named the Narvik Fleet, is now in service.

However, the name Narvik is often present in Hitler's mind, which is also evident from this. (2nd Reuters Telegram)

European War Anecdotes 25

### Hitler's Melancholy

After the German army reoccupied the Rhineland in 1936, many insightful people in France realized that France was no longer strong enough to pursue an independent foreign policy. France had been reduced to a second-rate power and had to find its place between the two major European nations—Britain and Germany. It could either emulate Switzerland, remaining neutral between the two powers and striving for self-preservation, or follow Italy’s example, choosing one side and abandoning any other thoughts.

However, the French were not satisfied with either of these strategies. During the Czech crisis in 1938, although Prime Minister Daladier ultimately leaned towards following Britain, this went against his personal wishes and failed to gain unanimous support nationwide. Even after France declared war on Germany a year later, the nation was still not united in its opposition. Many, while not pro-German and not believing in totalitarianism, believed that Britain could not provide effective assistance to France in resisting the German invasion.

Britain was as aware of the serious internal divisions in France as Germany was. Before the blitzkrieg began, the British government had tried hard to have Reynaud succeed Daladier. After Reynaud became Prime Minister, calls for a separate peace continued to rise, so he sought to take drastic measures to cope with the situation. He denounced some cabinet members as traitors and threatened them with imprisonment. He granted great power to the ruthless Mandel, placing him in charge of internal affairs, and the prominent figures among the pro-peace faction were silenced. As the war became increasingly urgent, Reynaud and several ministers still insisted that France should continue to resist, even if it meant retreating to the French-owned island of Madagascar in the southeastern corner of Africa.

The British government believed that Reynaud was the most reliable person to keep France fighting, so they placed great trust in him. Unexpectedly, when the final crisis arrived in mid-June, Reynaud was clearly unable to cope. His government moved from Paris to Tours, and then to Bordeaux, and many cabinet members were scattered in the chaos. Reynaud himself, as the German motorized divisions approached Bordeaux, attempted to flee to Spain but was turned back by the Spanish authorities. Shortly thereafter, news came that he had been seriously injured in a car accident.

In reality, it was not Reynaud, on whom Britain had placed its hopes, who was trying to regroup and continue resisting Germany, but former Prime Minister Daladier, whom Reynaud had sidelined. In the third week of June, just after the Franco-German armistice was signed, it was not Reynaud, but Daladier who gathered a group of leading figures from the political world in Bordeaux.

Daladier also gathered his comrades, including many current and former ministers, as well as numerous senators and deputies. They urgently planned to travel to North Africa. By chance, a ship, the Massilia, was docked in the port of Bordeaux, and on June 21, they boarded the ship and sailed to Casablanca in North Africa. On board were more than a hundred important figures from the French political scene, including the Minister of the Navy, Campinchi, the Minister of the Interior, Mandel, the Minister of Education, Zay, and the former Minister of Foreign Affairs, Delbos.

At that time, there were seven divisions of French troops in North Africa, and a large part of the French fleet was stationed in Oran, Algeria. These land and naval forces could not only defend North Africa against German and Italian attacks, but also assist British forces in launching offensives in the Mediterranean. They wanted to establish their own independent government; this was an important foundation.

When Daladier and his group of more than a hundred people arrived in Casablanca, they were warmly welcomed by General Noguès, the Resident-General of French Morocco, which greatly boosted their morale. General Noguès, who had long held a high position in the colonies, had extensive experience in colonial administration. He saw France not only as a European nation but also as a major global power. Although France on the European continent had been defeated, the entire French territory did not necessarily have to follow suit.

General Noguès was even more shocked when he saw the German armistice terms. According to his interpretation, accepting these terms would not only be a humiliation for France but would also subject it to perpetual subjugation. He publicly declared that he did not recognize the armistice terms as applicable to North Africa and that he was prepared to cooperate with those who advocated continuing the war against Germany.

The end of June and the beginning of July were a crucial juncture in the fate of France. A fierce diplomatic battle unfolded in Casablanca, which was not only closely related to the internal conflicts in France but was also very important in the Anglo-German war. Participants included not only local figures but also important figures from the governments of Britain, Germany, and France.

Shortly after Daladier arrived in Casablanca, the French Pétain government immediately sent a telegram ordering General Noguès, the Resident-General of Morocco, to detain the Massilia and everyone on board. General Noguès hesitated greatly upon receiving this order. He was stationed abroad and did not know the true situation in France. All he knew was that Marshal Pétain, who had always been respected, General Weygand, and President Lebrun had all joined the new government. He felt that he should not deliberately disobey orders before understanding the actual position of this government.

At the same time, he also received an order to arrest Mandel. Mandel was one of the most vigorous in assisting Reynaud to suppress the pro-peace faction after the disastrous defeat in Belgium. Although Noguès obeyed the order and arrested him, he released him within a few days and sent him back to the Massilia to participate in meetings to form a new government.

At this time, the situation in Casablanca was tense, and the trend was gradually leaning towards aligning with Britain and continuing the war in French overseas territories. At this critical moment, it was a great opportunity for Britain to take the lead and actively launch a diplomatic offensive. Unfortunately, Britain had not yet taken any action, and Germany had already preempted them.

On July 1, the Pétain government sent a special envoy by plane to Casablanca. The envoy was none other than General Giraud, who had been defeated in the battle in northern France and taken prisoner. Important figures in the German military and political establishment had long conversations with him. After the armistice was concluded, they put him on a plane and sent him back to Clermont-Ferrand, near the new French government. He then recounted everything the Germans had said. In order to resolve the crisis in North Africa, the Pétain government sent him as a special envoy.

It would be unfair and inaccurate to say that General Giraud was an internal traitor. He had fought bravely and had been captured while commanding operations in a tank. Having personally experienced the situation, he could not help but feel sad. He was moved by the strength of the German military, and he was even more deeply moved by the weaknesses exposed by the French army and government. He had heard German propaganda about Germany's inevitable victory and Britain's inevitable defeat and was intoxicated by it. If the Germans wanted to find someone who favored the idea of Germany's inevitable victory, there was probably no one more suitable than him.

General Giraud flew to Casablanca at this critical moment. He stayed for two days, speaking frankly with General Noguès. After their conversation, Noguès's attitude changed. General Giraud's words had convinced Noguès that prolonging the war, whether at home or abroad, would only be detrimental to France.

It was not until July 3 that two British envoys, Lord Gort and Duff Cooper, flew to Casablanca for negotiations. One was General Gort, the commander-in-chief of the British army, and the other was Duff Cooper, the Minister of Information, one of the most progressive members of Churchill's cabinet. They were late in arriving, at least two days behind. (To be continued)

### British Secretary of State for India Speaks on the Situation of the Italo-Greek War: Greek Naval Bases Can Enable British Forces to Control Italy's Fate

London - The British Secretary of State for India, Amery, said in a speech yesterday that the Axis powers wished to occupy Greece as part of their plan to eliminate British influence in Egypt and the Middle East, and to expel the British fleet from the Mediterranean. But why would Mussolini recklessly launch this attack on Greece, without justification and without adequate preparation? It is likely that one reason is that the relations between the Axis powers are not as harmonious as they are portrayed. Germany and Italy are both hegemonic states, but compared to Germany, Italy's position is subordinate. This smaller hegemonic power probably wants to preempt the larger hegemonic power, seize at least one valuable asset as a bargaining chip, and demand a greater say in the early stages of carving up the Balkans. Mussolini must have initially believed that the Greeks would surrender without a fight, or fight without strength. Where did his miscalculation lie? If the reason is the inferiority of the Italian national character, he does not believe so. Among the Italian soldiers who have collapsed and fled from Greece, there are many of the most elite soldiers in the Italian army. The Alpini troops, in particular, performed outstandingly in the last Great War. If they were fighting in self-defense or for a cause they believed in, I know they would be able to achieve something. But why would they be willing to sacrifice their lives in a war that they knew was unnecessary and unjust, one that would not bring glory even if they won, and would only subject Italy to German control forever? As for why the Greek soldiers are fighting so bravely, it is because they know they are in the right, because they deeply resent the atrocities committed by the Italians, and because they deeply love their beautiful mountains and rivers. In addition, there is probably one more point: the Greek soldiers also know that in this decisive war, they are not only defending Greece, but also defending more ancient and broader principles. They are also fighting to protect freedom against tyranny, and civilization against barbarism, just as their ancestors did 2,500 years ago. We must never forget that when ancient Greece defeated Persia, the foundations of Western civilization, literature, art, philosophy, and political thought were preserved. Today, as the same disaster reappears, the Greek people have not forgotten their glorious ancient history, and they are fighting alongside us against tyranny. We are deeply honored, he said. Amery concluded by saying that Greek naval bases can enable British forces to control Italy's fate and block German attacks on Turkey. In the future, British forces can also use this base to join with Allied forces to deal a fatal blow to Germany. (Reuters, 2nd)

### Laval Cancels Trip to Paris

Vichy - According to semi-official sources, the Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister of the Vichy government, Laval, has canceled his trip to Paris to consult with German representatives. It is widely believed that this action was taken on the orders of Marshal Pétain. (Reuters, 2nd)

### Reports of Uprising in Bessarabia Untrue: Moscow Denies

Moscow - Foreign reports have alleged that an uprising recently occurred in the Bessarabia region, which was recently acquired by the Soviet Union.

(International Telegram, 2nd)

### British Air Force Celebrates Achievements: 600 Enemy Aircraft Shot Down

London - Several squadrons of British fighter planes stationed at a certain base have shot down 599 enemy aircraft. To encourage them to reach the milestone of 600, a reward will be given to the pilot who shoots down the 600th enemy aircraft, to be used for a "celebration banquet." All the pilots are eager to win this reward, and the competition is fierce. As a result, the 600th aircraft was shot down on Saturday morning by two Spitfire fighters working together. One of the pilots had previously shot down 11 enemy aircraft and was 21 years old. The other had destroyed 19 enemy aircraft, and both had received medals. (Reuters, 2nd)

### Weygand Inspects Troops in North Africa

French General Weygand, the Delegate-General of the French government in Africa, has arrived in North Africa to inspect the troops stationed in various territories. He arrived here today and immediately reviewed the troops. Afterward, he met with local authorities to inquire about the situation. When the general passed through the streets, large crowds cheered and paid their respects. (Havas, 1st)

### Morocco Declares Loyalty to Pétain

Vichy - Diplomatic circles here say that as a result of the British attack on the French fleet near Oran, the pro-de Gaulle elements in Morocco have been completely eliminated. Since General Weygand went to Morocco, the region has declared its loyalty to the Pétain government. Weygand has traveled to Oran, Kebir, Casablanca, Rabat, Marrakech, and other places to inspect the situation. The residents of various places gave him a warm welcome. General Weygand, accompanied by General Noguès, the Governor-General of Morocco, visited important military bases throughout Morocco and expressed his satisfaction with the organization and discipline of the French troops stationed there. Based on the above situation, it can be seen that the threat of pro-de Gaulle elements in Morocco has now been "morally conquered" by the Pétain government. (Haitong Telegram, 2nd)

### Soviet Union Building Large Numbers of Ships

London - According to broadcasts from Moscow's wireless radio station, the Soviet Union has built a powerful submarine fleet and is currently building large numbers of other warships.

### Soviet Timber Industry Mechanized, Tree Felling Greatly Increased

Moscow - The Soviet Union, possessing one-third of the world's forests, now has 29,000,000,000.000 cubic meters of mature and nearly mature trees. The Soviet timber industry has been highly mechanized. Soviet-made electric and gasoline-powered chainsaws, as well as the latest machinery, are widely used. In most timber operations, tree felling has been mechanized. In one timber operation in the Urals, each team of loggers can fell 200 to 300 meters of trees with gasoline-powered chainsaws per shift. The transport of timber has also been mechanized. For ease of transport, the Soviet Union has built many tractor roads and narrow-gauge railways. At the beginning of this year, 6,500 kilometers of roads and 5,000 kilometers of narrow-gauge railways were constructed. In winter, single-track sledges are used. The single-track sledges manufactured by Soviet engineers can carry 20 meters of timber. Due to the mechanization of equipment, the Soviet timber industry has increased the work of each lumberjack by 34 percent. (TASS, 2nd)

### The Grand Performance of the Hardball Cup: Strategic Brilliance Defeats the Jewish Team

The "Hardball Cup" Individual Table Tennis Championship, a sensational event in Shanghai and an unprecedented undertaking in the world of table tennis, was organized by the Qibu Table Tennis Club. It was held at the Ningbo Road Bankers' Association yesterday (the 1st) at 7 p.m. Over six hundred Chinese and foreign guests attended, making it a grand occasion. The event began with an opening speech by the president of the club, Chen Linsheng, followed by speeches from the chairmen, Pu Jiting and Xu Duo. The competition then commenced, with Fu Guiqing, Zhou Bin, and Jiang Zongdi serving as referees. The first match was for the Cup, with Mao Yong facing Xu Junyan. Xu was brave but lacked strategy, losing to Mao Yong with a score of two to one. The deciding match featured Feng Chanchu against Weng Zhichao. The two were evenly matched, resulting in a score of two to one, with Feng Chanchu turning defeat into victory. Next, famous female players from all over Shanghai took to the stage to perform, also using hardballs, offering a unique spectacle. The first act featured Madame de Vise, the Vienna Women's Singles Champion, against Miss Zhang Yongru, the captain of the Women's Youth Team. These two were the leading female players from the East and West, making the match extremely intense. Zhang, after switching to hardballs, could not control the ball's characteristics. De Vise's chops were extremely low, and Zhang's powerful shots either went out of bounds or into the net, resulting in a crushing defeat of two straight sets for Zhang against Madame de Vise. The doubles performance followed, with the Women's Youth Team temporarily changing their lineup, resulting in a lack of coordination and a significant impact on their strength. Meanwhile, Pei Cheng, Feng Mingyin, Gui Rongzheng, and others had excellent teamwork. In another scene, Hualian's Lin Jinlan and Qibu's Cai Xiuyu, who were long-time partners, faced the Women's Youth Team's Zhu Shangxin and Zhang Yongru. Although both teams from the Women's Youth Team fought bravely, they were unable to overcome their opponents and lost two matches in a row. After the performance, the friendly match between Qibu and the Jewish team commenced. The Qibu players were exceptionally skilled in hardball techniques. In the first match, Qibu's Hu Yiping faced the Jewish team's Fuliutuo, ultimately defeating Fuliutuo with a score of three to one. In the second match, the Jewish team's Klinmusigai faced Cheng Shuming from Qibu. Cheng relied on his final efforts to defeat his formidable opponent. In the third match, Qibu's young player Yang Kaiyun faced the Jewish team's main player, De Vise. De Vise's short blocks were exceptionally tricky, but Yang relied on his agile jumps, securing a final victory with a score of three to two. The finale was Chen Linsheng's match against Madame de Vise, which was the most eye-catching battle of the evening. The veteran's skills were still sharp, and his left and right serving postures were incredibly beautiful. His shots were steady. Madame de Vise won the first game, but from the second game onward, the veteran launched powerful shots. The two engaged in a series of shots and chops, creating a dazzling spectacle. The veteran ultimately won three games in a row, overwhelming Madame de Vise with a score of three to one. As a result, Qibu defeated the Jewish team by a score of four to zero. The full results are recorded below:

Mao Yong defeated Xu Junyan (Cup Match) 2-1

### An Upset in the Hong Kong Football League: Star Island Suffers an Unprecedented Defeat

The Throne of the First Division is About to Shake: Eastern and South China Trail by One Point

(Hong Kong News) Star Island Club, an emerging football powerhouse in Hong Kong with a record of seven wins and one draw in eight matches, has maintained an undefeated record. In the first round, they secured an effortless victory against Eastern, and a draw against South China. The championship seemed firmly within their grasp.

From this point on, the possibility of the championship throne being shaken has greatly increased. South China and Eastern, known as the "Three Pillars," are now closely following behind with six wins, two draws, and one loss in nine matches, totaling fourteen points. Star Island, after this devastating defeat, has a record of seven wins, one draw, and one loss in nine matches, totaling fifteen points. Compared to Eastern and South China, they are only one point ahead. In the upcoming second round, whichever of the Eastern and South China teams defeats Star Island will easily seize this glorious throne.

### Extreme Confusion in Finance and Foreign Exchange

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw the HSBC quote unchanged. The black market situation for British and American currencies was chaotic, with tightness and looseness alternating from morning to night. Initially, news of the successful Sino-American loan, with the US lending China $100 million to help stabilize its finances and consolidate the legal tender, caused exceptional excitement. This was evident in the public bond market. However, foreign exchange dealers were caught off guard and rushed to sell, with speculators unloading large quantities. The looseness exceeded the six-yuan mark, reaching 6.03125 yuan. But from 10 a.m., American banks began to show interest in buying, and speculators followed suit, reversing the trend and softening the market. By the early afternoon, the spot rate for American currency had contracted to 5.75 yuan. Subsequently, reports of re-sales by Hong Kong Electric and other companies led to a recovery, with slight increases of 0.015625 and 0.03125 for British and American currencies compared to last weekend's closing rates.

Loose in the Morning, Tight Again Later

In the early morning, the exchange rates for British, American, and Shanghai currencies were level. The American currency was unchanged against the British currency, down by a fraction against the Shanghai currency, and there was no market for French currency. The Central Bank's quotes for various currencies remained the same. Banks opened in the morning with spot selling prices of 3 pence 8125 for British gold and 5.8125 yuan for American currency, both unchanged from last weekend's closing rates. After the opening, news of the US loan to China of $100 million, which would strengthen China's finances and consolidate the legal tender exchange rate, led to market easing. Speculators and Hong Kong Electric all sold off, and the market tightened. It was estimated that speculators and Hong Kong Electric sold this month's American currency for 5.90625 yuan, and there was a significant volume of spot transactions at 6 yuan. Around 9:30 a.m., Hua Bank also sold, and the spot rate for American currency rose above the six-yuan mark, briefly reaching 6.03125 yuan. The HSBC quote was announced unchanged, and the silver balancing tax was also level. Later, American banks showed interest in buying, and Hua Bank and speculators followed suit, reversing the trend and tightening the market. It was estimated that Hua Bank bought spot American currency from foreign banks for 5.9375 yuan, and speculators bought this month's American currency from foreign banks for 5.84375 yuan. By noon, the spot rate for American currency had contracted to 5.8125 yuan, and it was difficult to sell. The noon closing rates were 3 pence 71875 for spot British gold and 5.8125 yuan for American currency, the same as the opening prices.

Hong Kong Electric Sells Again at a High Price

The afternoon market opened tight, with the American currency briefly reaching 5.75 yuan. Hong Kong Electric and other companies sold at a high price, causing the situation to shift slightly. It was estimated that they sold to Youli Shanghai and others, with spot and this month's deliveries both at 5.584375 yuan. The market was quiet until the evening closing. Foreign banks also traded spot American currency at 5.84375 yuan. In the end, the spot and this month's rates were 3 pence 71875 for British gold and 5.8125 yuan for American currency. Compared to last Saturday's closing, spot British gold rose by 0.015625, and the American currency rose by 0.03125. This month's rates eased by 0.03125 and 0.0625, respectively.

Hong Kong and Shanghai Drop First, Then Recover

A dispatch from Hong Kong on the 2nd (Monday) stated that the foreign exchange market opened erratically this morning. The spot and forward rates for British currency remained unchanged, and the spot rate for American currency tightened by 0.0625, reaching 23.4375 yuan. The spot rate for the Shanghai currency fell sharply by 7.5 yuan, reaching 395 yuan. At 10:25 a.m., the market stabilized, and the spot rate for American currency eased by 0.0625, reaching 23.5 yuan. At 11:30 a.m., the market leveled off, and there were no changes in any currencies. The market opened steadily at 2:30 p.m., with the spot rate for American currency softening again by 0.0625, reaching 23.4375 yuan. The spot rate for the Shanghai currency rose by 5 yuan, reaching 400 yuan. The other currencies remained unchanged.

Tianjin: British and American Currencies Both Contract

A dispatch from Tianjin on the 2nd (Monday) stated that the foreign exchange market opened level this morning. The London telegraphic transfer rate softened by 0.03125, reaching 3 pence 96875.

The black market rate for "Joint Notes" rose by 0.4 yuan, reaching 86 yuan.

Fluctuations in American Currency Notes

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw significant fluctuations in the black market price of silver dollars, ultimately rising by about 40 yuan compared to last Saturday. British and American gold pounds also fell and then rose, ultimately increasing by 1 yuan. The trend for British gold notes was dull and stable, with the market price leveling off. The prices of American currency notes fluctuated, initially falling to 16.7 yuan due to news of the Sino-American loan. Subsequently, rumors about treasury bills were rampant, reaching a high of 17.2 yuan at noon and even higher at 17.33 yuan in the afternoon. However, it later retreated slightly to 17.08 yuan, a drop of 0.32 yuan compared to the off-market price last Saturday. The Hong Kong exchange rate followed the weakening trend of the Hong Kong and Shanghai exchange rates. The trend for Japanese gold notes softened again, retreating to 1.53 yuan in the evening market. Korean notes remained strong, with the evening market rate at 1.19 yuan.

### Turbulent Gold Market: Fluctuations of 240 Yuan, Trading to Begin at 9 AM Starting Today

Yesterday's black market for spot silver dollars was lively with huge fluctuations, brisk trading, and rising prices, nearly reaching the 6,000 yuan mark, with the highest seen at 5,940 yuan. In the early morning, the momentum weakened, opening at 5,700 yuan, more than 100 yuan lower than last Saturday. This was due to the sharp rise in foreign exchange, which was attributed to the success of the Sino-American loan and the anticipation of a bright future for exchange rates. As a result, the gold market was flooded with selling pressure. Unexpectedly, the market rebounded, as foreign exchange turned from loose to tight with extreme speed. By the closing, the market had recovered to 5,875 yuan, an increase of 37 yuan from the previous day. Over 10,000 taels were traded throughout the day. The price of jewelry gold was stable in the end, and the price of customs gold was fixed. Also, starting today, the morning trading will begin at 9 AM, opening at the same time as foreign exchange trading.

Silver Dollars Rise by 37 Yuan

In the early morning, the foreign exchange market loosened, and the news environment was negative. The market opened sharply lower by over 100 yuan. Silver firms initially traded 20 taels at only 5,700 yuan. Later, gold firms bought 40 taels from silver firms at 5,740 yuan, while money changers sold 30 taels to gold firms at 5,725 yuan. Subsequently, news of a tightening in the foreign exchange market boosted morale, and buyers rushed in, causing a rapid rebound. It was estimated that securities firms and gold firms all rushed to buy. Securities firms bought 20 taels from money changers at 5,830 yuan, and gold firms sold 30 taels to silver firms, quoted at 5,800 yuan. By noon, the rising trend intensified, and sellers were hard to find. The market closed high at 5,870 yuan, with gold firms buying 10 taels from silver firms. The afternoon market opened steady. Securities firms sold 30 taels to gold firms at 5,865 yuan. Soon after, the tightening trend in foreign exchange intensified again, and securities firms became the dominant buyers, driving the price up to 5,940 yuan. Silver firms then traded 20 taels. Later, money changers took advantage of the high price to sell, driving the price down within the 900-yuan range. Silver firms then sold 30 taels to gold firms at 5,850 yuan. But at that time, retail investors were all scrambling to buy, and the market was firm and rising. Securities firms bought 20 taels from silver firms again, quoted at 5,885 yuan. As a result, silver firms sold 20 taels to gold firms at 5,875 yuan, an increase of 37 yuan compared to last Saturday. The daily fluctuation was 240 yuan. The selling price of spot gold at cash firms was over 10 yuan higher than that of silver dollars, while the buying price was 30 yuan lower. The current price of standard gold was 50-60 yuan lower than the posted price of gold, and there was little trading.

Jewelry Gold Changes Four Times

The price of jewelry gold per tael changed four times. At 10:30 AM, it fell by 10 yuan, then rose by 10 yuan at 12:00 PM. At 2:50 PM in the afternoon, it rose another 10 yuan, then fell by 10 yuan at 3:15 PM. As a result, the price at major firms remained at 600 yuan, with new firms quoting similar prices. The buying price was about 30 yuan lower.

### Slight Fluctuations in the Securities and Bond Markets

The securities black market initially rose yesterday due to rumors of another large loan from the United States to China, but the rise was not dramatic. Later, it rose and then rebounded due to the fall in gold prices, rising sharply by over 200 yuan. Public bonds therefore eased again. Observers believe that the loan terms were favorable to the war of resistance, so the gold market did not decline significantly, and public bonds did not rise as a result. After this change, the rising trend may intensify slightly. When the market rose in the morning, Xinhua and Xinfu actively sold, and Hongda and Tongshun also unloaded. Juxin bulls also closed out their positions. Buyers such as Lianhe, Yichang, Lianyi, Hengfu, and Shenchang did not engage in large transactions. The noon closing was only 3-5 jiao higher. In the afternoon, Xinfu and Xinhua continued to deliver spot goods. Yichang, Lianhe, and Lianyi reappeared, while Shenchang continued to buy. Shengda and Yongkang bought slightly. Class C bonds briefly rose above 4 yuan in the morning, but then fell below again in the afternoon. The result was mixed, with fluctuations of only about 1 jiao. 1.8 to 1.9 million yuan worth of transactions were conducted. A brief summary is listed below:

Category Highest Low Closing Compared to Previous Day

Unified A 73.20 72.70 72.70 Down 0.10

Unified B 67.40 66.85 66.95 Down 0.15

Unified C 64.30 63.35 63.50 Down 0.10

Unified D 62.70 62.10 62.30 Up 0.10

Unified E 63.75 63.10 63.25 Down 0.10

96 Bond 6.20 6.00 6.05 Down 0.05

In stock trading, 400 shares of China Merchants Electric were traded at a price of 7.4 yuan, a slight increase of 0.2 yuan compared to the previous day.

In addition, the stock market at the Zhongye Gongsuo (General Industries Association) opened with prices weakening due to the easing foreign exchange market and the uncertain local situation. Soon after, it rebounded and strengthened, with active trading. Although sellers were very active throughout the day, buyers absorbed the supply vigorously. The closing sentiment was quite good. The trend for rubber stocks was also stable, with more transactions than before.

### The Grain and Yangmi Market is Relatively Stable, with Japonica Rice Rising to 96 Yuan

The yangmi (foreign rice) market in the early morning continued the rising trend of the previous day, with sellers still trying to raise prices. However, with the continued arrival of goods in transit, sales did not keep pace, and industry associations issued announcements reiterating the ban. Many outside investors who had profited sought to exit, and thus the spot price of yangmi was relatively stable, only increasing by 2-3 jiao compared to the previous market. However, forward goods were scarce due to new orders, and future fees were high, so sellers regarded them as rare commodities. The spot price of No. 1 Saigon rice from Yinghua Sifu, which opened at 93 yuan last week, rose as high as 95 yuan to 96.5 yuan yesterday. November delivery also reached 95 yuan. No. 2 and Xiaojiao rice saw some selling from speculative traders, and the market atmosphere was relatively stable. December delivery for No. 2 was 89.3-89.5 yuan, and Xiaojiao was 84.5-85 yuan. In the afternoon, there was little trading in the Miscellaneous Grain Association due to the association's crackdown on futures trading. The total daily transaction volume was less than 300 tons for Yinghua Sifu, and only 6,000 bags for spot rice. No. 1 Saigon was 80.05 yuan, No. 2 Saigon was 76.5-74.5 yuan, Huojiao was 79 yuan, No. 2 Siamese was 74.5-74 yuan, Xiaojiao Jian was 73.8-73.5 yuan, Tokyo Cici Jian was 68 yuan, Milu was 68.12-68 yuan, Suijian was 65-62 yuan, and Wuhu Jian was 73 yuan.

After the disruption of transportation outside the concession, the source of domestic rice such as new japonica and luzhong has been cut off, and the amount stored within the concession is extremely small. General stores are eager to meet demand and search for it, causing speculators to hoard and drive up prices. As a result, selling prices have soared, and standards have been lost. New japonica in original bags is 96 yuan, Xiaozhong in original bags is 96 yuan, and Hujian is 92-93 yuan. Duyangjian is in short supply and without a market.

The destination of glutinous rice is still good, and the market is still firm. However, prices have not fluctuated greatly. Kaiyi Libaiyuan is 92 yuan, Hong Kong Baiyuan is 80 yuan, and special ones have been quoted at 85-86 yuan.

A large amount of yangmi continues to arrive in Shanghai. Yihuo Yanghang's Guisheng Wheel arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday, carrying 4044 bags from Hong Kong, and another 300 bags were transported to Tianjin by the same ship yesterday. Fagongsi's Luosi Wheel arrived yesterday morning, carrying over 16,000 bags of yangmi directly from Saigon, and docked at the Gonghexing Wharf in Hongkou. Taigugongsi's Hanyang Wheel also transported 4,692 bags from Hong Kong and arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday. Yihuo Yanghang's Lisheng Wheel arrived in Hong Kong yesterday evening, also carrying 10,549 bags from Hong Kong, and docked at the Roosevelt Wharf, scheduled to begin unloading this morning. (Zu)

### The Supply of Factory Flour is Becoming More Urgent, with Yang Flour Trading Predominant

The flour market is becoming increasingly brisk. The wholesale price of Huachang flour is still 18 yuan. The two factories in Huifu supply 8,065 bags per day, but the output of the old Chepai brand is very small, so over 2,400 bags are replaced by Australian yang flour. The supply of wood flour is becoming more and more scarce, and it is said that it is completely out of stock at the Guihuo stack. Therefore, the market trading has completely shifted to yang flour, which is a very regrettable situation. The current price of Yangfen's Zhonglou and Huaniaopai brands has risen from 19.1 yuan to 19.4 yuan, and the price of goods arriving by ship earlier this month is 19.2-19.25 yuan, so the rising trend can be said to be fierce. The total number of goods handled by the local customers was over 10,000 bags of the current goods and the goods on the way. Domestic flour and Japanese flour were generally in short supply in the formal market.

The source of wheat is still a small amount, mostly designated for Japanese factories. The price of those received in the open market is still limited to 27 yuan. On the Huachang side, there is no equivalent Dumei available for purchase. With the rising price of flour, the owners are even more inclined to hoard and drive up prices, so the market remains quiet.

### Speculation is Also Attacking Miscellaneous Grains

Yesterday's market situation for miscellaneous grains and soybean oil was generally flat and dull in the early market. In the afternoon, the authorities of the Miscellaneous Grain Association banned yangmi trading in the market, so speculators who are difficult to settle down turned to miscellaneous grain activities. As a result, the prices of all goods rose after being flat. Raw soybean oil and soybean oil rose sharply by 0.5-1 yuan, and soybeans also stopped falling and rose by 0.5 yuan. Transactions included 50 dan of Dayouchang soybean oil, 100 pieces of Yanqui soybean oil, 50 pieces of Qingqi soybean oil, 450 pieces of Jiaozhou soybean oil, 600 pieces of raw oil, 50 pieces of Yantai raw oil, 500 tins of Yan Ting raw oil, over 200 barrels of Qingdao raw oil, 2,000 barrels of futures, 1,700 bags of Tianjin Jinyuan, 200 bags of green beans, 1,000 bags of Qingdao soybeans, and 100 bags of Taicang soybeans.

### Yarn and Cotton Yarn Soar, the Sales of Fine Yarn to Hong Kong Suddenly Become Active, Shuangma Rebounds by 27 Yuan

The yarn market fluctuated greatly, initially because of the establishment of a large amount of loans from America and China, and speculators became tired and pessimistic. Then, the demand for 32-count and 42-count fine yarn from Hong Kong helped boost the market. Short sellers covered, and the foreign exchange market tightened after being loose, causing prices to rise rapidly. The low of 20-count Shuangma was 1,207 yuan, and the high was 1,260 yuan, with a difference of 53 yuan.

The morning opening of the Shuangma yarn market was due to reports that a 50 million yuan loan was established, and sentiment was bearish. The opening price was 1,223 yuan, and it fell slightly to 1,216 yuan. Then, it was heard that the foreign exchange market was gradually loosening, and there was a lot of selling pressure on the table. At one point, it fell to 1,207 yuan. At this time, it was heard that sales in Guangdong were not weak, Japanese yarn prices were high, there were many bullish rumors in the market, and the exchange rate also tightened. Therefore, the general speculators who grabbed hats and shorted realized that the environment was bad and rushed to cover their positions. Some even turned from short to long. At one time, there was a large gathering on the table, and buying sentiment permeated the market. The market price rose higher and higher, soaring to 1,252 yuan. Later, the price fell slightly as those who had profited sold out. The closing price was 1,252 yuan. The statistics for the day's transactions were 5,770 bales. The market for 10-count Shuangma rose by 27 yuan. It was found that 150 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong today. The amount of each gang's purchases is listed below:

Same trade 4,500 Hong Kong 1,160

Wenzhou 90 Statistics 5,770

### Cotton Benefits the Yarn Market

The current situation for cotton is that the yarn market has rebounded, and the Sino-American loan has been established. The foreign exchange market has risen and then fallen, and the sentiment has turned bullish. Therefore, although factories do not have a large need, the holders of goods have a stronger attitude, and the market is tight and looking good.

In other news, the price of foreign cotton is as follows: the New York cotton market is quiet, initially because of a lack of major buyers, and later because of selling by overseas merchants. The result was that the closing price fell by about 3 points compared to the previous day. The Indian market is closed, and the forecast is for a decrease of about 1 rupee.

Transactions in foreign cotton in Shanghai have been quiet and abnormal recently. All parties' intentions to purchase are very weak, and currently no one intends to buy. Everyone is waiting for the development of the situation.

### Piece Goods and Cotton Cloth Buyers Suddenly Become Active Due to the Removal of Transportation Restrictions, but Taxes Will be Collected Along the Way

Factory cloth: The morning market opened flat yesterday. Later, rumors spread that the occupied areas would remove transportation restrictions and switch to a tax system. As a result, buying sentiment suddenly increased, and selling prices rose. White goods, coarse and fine cloth, and twill increased by 0.25-0.5 yuan per piece. Bleached and dyed cloth increased by 0.3-0.5 yuan. Local traders and hoarders absorbed the most, with over 1,200 pieces of various cloths being traded. Guangdong and Hong Kong traders handled over 400 pieces of bleached and dyed cloth, silk cloth, and printed cloth. Zhejiang and Fujian traders handled over 200 pieces of colored cloth and bleached twill. The Yantai traders in the north handled 170-180 packages of 16-pound colored butterfly brand coarse cloth.

Eastern cloth: The trend was firm, rising after falling. The price of white Longtou fine cloth once fell below 35 yuan. Later, with the rising yarn market, the price gradually increased. The market price once reached 36.2 yuan, but the closing price was slightly lower, at 35.95 yuan. The demand for Four Gentlemen's serge was especially strong among local traders. The highest price was 1.1075 yuan, and the closing price was 1.0975 yuan.

Export cotton cloth: 860 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong today (the 3rd), and another 30 pieces were shipped to Siam.

### The Wool Textile Industry in Shanghai

In addition to woolen fabrics, Huachang Woolen Mill also produces silk and yarn fabrics, namely French lining, black carbon lining, soft lining, horsehair sleeve lining, patterned calico, rainproof cloth, flash satin, mercerized feather yarn, and rayon silk. Their sales are no less than woolen fabrics. Today there are many small factories, and the original woolen factories suffered from a great shortage of raw materials due to the European War.

Due to foreign exchange and environmental factors, selling prices have gradually increased, and all goods are selling very well. There are also many new factories being established. Camel velvet and Shaji factories are mostly reorganized to spin and weave woolen goods. Although their products are difficult to compare with imported goods, they can imitate 70-80% of the patterns, such as yuan Gongni Hailisi, uniform neihan Limeng, riding breeches neituosijin, plain Billi Haweini, suit tweed, wide and tight camel velvet, etc. Sales are even better.

Although Yihuo is the only British-owned woolen mill, its output and variety of patterns are large, accounting for a part of the power in the Shanghai woolen industry. This is all because it has large capital, excellent machines, and its products are the best sellers in the No. 55, 39, and 19 medium-thickness Billi, Shawi Chinese and Western suit tweed, riding breeches Ni Hailisi, etc. are also quite famous. In the summer, the two types of Palici feather yarn are the best. It is a pity that there is no output of winter overcoat cloth.

Japanese woolen mills are most victorious in single-sided tweed. The No. 1 is sold for 24-5 yuan per yard, No. 2 is about 22 yuan, and No. 3 is about 17 yuan. The super nebian has Western characters and sells for 30 yuan. Because Chinese merchants have no power to compete and British merchants are unwilling to imitate it, they are able to dominate it. The second is thin tweed, which sells for more than 9 yuan to 12-13 yuan, which is extremely suitable for the needs of Chinese clothing gowns, and is also inexpensive, which Yihuo and Chinese merchants cannot match.

### Silk and Tea: Both Near and Distant Silk are Small, the Export of Black Tea is Revived

Yesterday's New York silk market saw Yokohama spot at 1350 yuan, near term at 1360 yuan, which was 4 yuan lower than last weekend. The far term May was 1373 yuan, which was also 2 yuan lower than last week.

Yesterday, the black tea produced by Tuzhuang factories saw a revival in sales due to overseas telegrams requesting purchases. Jinchenglongxingcheng and other firms in the city purchased over 700 boxes, with prices ranging from 285 yuan to 310 yuan. It is said that Yihuo Tongfu and other firms also had plans to handle high-quality, colorless pearl tea.

### Coal and Coal Ball Factories Enter, 8.2 Yuan Per Load

The coal ball market increased in price this week, but entertaining guests and handling old stack orders resulted in uneven factory plate prices, with highs and lows differing by 4-5 yuan. However, starting yesterday, it has become more unified. The goods from Yitaixing, Nanyang, Guohua, and Dongfang and other major factories, are the same industry from the car, 152 yuan per ton, delivery plus another car force, the main street shop, 8.2 yuan per load, 164 yuan per ton.

### The Charcoal Market Has Slightly Relaxed

Although the charcoal market has seen reduced business due to the cut-off of supplies from Wenzhou, with no new goods arriving, a small amount has been shipped in by junk from Shenjiamen. However, the quantity is limited, and prices are high. Lake Creek River charcoal is priced at $16.50 per dan (a unit of weight), Haimen charcoal at $19.75, and Huangyan charcoal at $16.75. Nevertheless, prices have slightly relaxed compared to last month. Local retailers are selling at 5 cents per catty (a unit of weight) in local currency.

### Economic Talks   By Feng Liutang

Snuff (2)

Because of the different methods of steaming tobacco, the containers for storing it also vary. Westerners use their fingers to pinch, so they use cans and boxes for the convenience of pinching. Chinese people use their fingers to dip, so they can use bottles. Using a bottle is called a "hu" (壺), which is the shape of today's snuff bottle, i.e., the shape of an ancient "hu," so it is appropriate to call it a snuff bottle. There is also a reason for using bottles, because bottles have a large belly and a tightly bound neck, and the intake and output of tobacco only leaves a small hole. Furthermore, with the bottle cap tightly sealed, the contents are not easily leaked. Therefore, Chinese people often use this to store pills and powders. What is valued in snuff is its aroma, so using it to store pills and powders is a perfect match.

Snuff bottles should preferably be flat, which is naturally for the convenience of hiding in a pocket and carrying. However, the forms also vary in size, depending on the purpose. For example, those placed on desks and tables can be slightly larger, whether round or square, it does not matter. Those for carrying should preferably be small and flat. The material can be glass, crystal, jade, stone, or jadeite; it is not fixed. There is a lid on top, inlaid with jewels, and decorated with gold and silver. Inside the lid is a small long spoon, inserted into the bottle to take the tobacco. The tobacco taken out with the small spoon is placed in a snuff dish, for one's own use or to offer to guests. The dishes are mostly made of ivory, with a diameter of no more than one inch. Some are engraved with calligraphy and paintings. I once saw a small dish engraved with the entire preface to the Tengwang Pavilion, the characters of which were indistinguishable, but when viewed under a microscope, each character was clearly discernible and distinct. The engraved figures have detailed beards and eyebrows, and the landscapes have dense forests. Therefore, even a small dish can be worth hundreds of gold.

What shape were the snuff bottles that were originally imported from the West? My father wants to find evidence in "Dream of the Red Chamber"!

In "Dream of the Red Chamber," Qingwen is sick, and Baoyu takes snuff to give to her, which shows the packaging of Western snuff at that time.

Baoyu ordered Musk to bring snuff and give some to Qingwen to smell. After a few sneezes, she felt better. Musk really went to fetch a small flat box made of gold-inlaid gold-starred glass and handed it to Baoyu. Baoyu opened the lid, inside which was a Western enamel painting of a fair-haired, naked woman with fleshy wings on both sides. Inside was some real, high-quality Western tobacco. Qingwen only cared about looking at the painting. Baoyu said, "Smell some, it will lose its potency if it loses its scent."

This describes the form of the snuff box, which is not yet using a snuff bottle, indicating that it was still the original Western product. The following will show the effect of snuff.

"When Qingwen heard this, she hurriedly picked some with her fingernails and stuffed it into her nose, but nothing happened; then she picked some more and stuffed it into her nose, suddenly feeling a sour and spicy sensation penetrating into her nose, followed by five or six sneezes in a row, and tears and snot flowed immediately. Qingwen hurriedly closed the box and laughed, 'It's terribly spicy, quickly bring me some paper.' A little maid had already handed over a stack of fine paper, and Qingwen used them one by one to wipe her nose."

From this, we can see that inhaling snuff is done with fingernails, not with dipping. The sour and spicy taste is the characteristic of snuff. It is named "real, high-quality Western tobacco," which means there was already non-high-quality Western tobacco.

Snuff was also allowed to be inhaled by ministers in the imperial court with the emperor's permission. However, wearing court attire made it inconvenient to take it from the pocket, so small flat snuff bottles were used to hold the tobacco and inserted into the boot shaft, called "boot inserts."

It is said that the longer snuff is stored, the better it becomes. Therefore, storing tobacco is valued by snuff lovers. Some people only inhale snuff that has been stored for over a hundred years, and some tobacco worth a few taels can be worth hundreds of gold. There are also many types of snuff. Snuff lovers not only store tobacco, but also collect bottles, and often change their bottles according to the season, and change their material in winter. This kind of extravagant lifestyle is rarely seen in the current era of snuff decline, but snuff bottles are still widely collected by Westerners. (End)

### Promote Small-Scale Group Rice Purchases Form a Food Cooperative Association Various Groups Launch and Begin Preparations Reduce Fixed Prices with One Bag as a Unit Mr. Yu Qiaqing Plans to Raise Funds to Purchase 200,000 Bags of Rice

The market price of rice in this port has been soaring due to manipulation and monopoly, posing a serious threat to the residents of the concession. Various groups and leaders from all walks of life in this city are planning to establish the Shanghai Food Cooperative Association to increase the reserves in the concession and prevent speculative rice merchants from using their skills. A preparatory office has been established at Renji Hall on Yunnan Road and will be formally established in the near future. The association is being organized by various groups and individuals from all walks of life, including Yuan Ludeng, Wen Lanting, Pei Yunqing, Zhao Jinqing, Gui Yanfang, Huang Hanzhi, Guan Jiongzhi, Xi Yushu, Li Wenjie, Lu Gaoyi, Xu Baohua, Chen Tingrui, Yan Esheng, Ding Xuetong, Lu Yiming, Xu Zhiyi, Yin Zibai, Sun Ruihuang, Xie Zhifang, Chen Meibin, Wei Zhiwen, Yuan Hesong, Cui Fuzhuang, Yu Baosan, Shi Boqun, Li Zurong, Zhang Wenkui, Qiu Jufu, Guo Fuyun, Sun Guangzhi, Chen Yisheng, Li Zifeng, Zhong Baichuan, Chen Lianzhang, Chen Qingzhao, Zhang Nianxuan, Jin Zhixuan, Hu Mingshan, Wang Huanzhang, Gu Yixiang, Xi Shouyu, Ling Zifan, Yang Bogeng, and others. The main purpose is to promote collective purchases of small amounts of food, so that rice in this port does not pass through the hands of rice merchants, avoiding manipulation and raising of selling prices, which would make the food problem for the people more difficult.

Fundraising to Subsidize Small-Scale Rice Purchases

A reporter from the Pingming News Agency inquired at the preparatory office. According to the person in charge of the association, the association's general method is to give special preference to small-scale fixed households that purchase one to five bags of rice. When ordering, only one-quarter of the goods' value is collected in advance, and the association will find ways to raise funds from enthusiastic people in the community to subsidize the rest. The members of the association will pay a fund to be used. Although there are various difficulties in practice when handling small-scale group rice purchases, they are only technical problems. Based on the experience of various groups that have handled group grain purchases in the past, experts from various industries such as transportation and shipping have been specially invited to form a technical committee to study in detail and be responsible for practical work. Therefore, when the goods arrive, transportation and distribution should not cause major difficulties. In short, consumer cooperation depends on the concerted efforts of everyone to overcome difficulties. It is hoped that enthusiastic people in the community will cooperate and assist in various ways, so that more grain reserves in the market can reduce the threat of starvation by one point, and reducing the burden of life is an essential element for social stability. Now, the Pudong Fellow Villagers Association's group rice purchase is proceeding in this way, which can be used as an example to follow.

The Agency for Rice Purchases Will Be Established Within Days

The Municipal Food Adjustment Association handles large-scale group grain purchases, and a large number of foreign rice has been shipped in successively, with remarkable results. However, small-scale purchases are too cumbersome and cannot be兼及. Now that the Food Cooperative Association has been established successively, on the one hand, it is a division of labor for regulating the city's food supply. On the other hand, if it can contribute the experience of holding small-scale collective purchases to various industry associations and fellow villagers associations in this city to organize small-scale group grain purchase groups, then with everyone's support, it will be easy to achieve and will certainly increase its benefits. The city's food supply should not cause serious problems again. It is heard that the Shanghai Food Cooperative Association will start accepting small-scale rice ordering requests from its members and non-members of the association in the outside world immediately after its establishment within days.

Yu Qiaqing Talks About the Future of People's Food

According to Mr. Yu Qiaqing, the food reserves in this city are extremely sufficient, and there is no need to worry about shortages. According to the investigation, the total amount of grain stored in the warehouses in Pudong, Hongkou, Central District, and Huxi is more than 500,000 bags. Each bag is calculated at one stone and two and a half dou, totaling 625,000 stone. At present, the daily rice consumption in this city is only more than 9,000 stone. Even if only considering the warehouse storage, it is enough for two or three months of purchase. Moreover, as prices soar and the cost of living increases, the number of citizens who voluntarily move to other places is increasing daily. Therefore, it is a pity that speculative rice merchants are aiming at nothing and manipulating food rice. Those who are unclear in the outside world are even criticizing non-industry people for hoarding food rice. Although this kind of rumor is not without some basis, there are those who exaggerate it. However, although the food reserves for the people are extremely sufficient, if we do not prepare for a rainy day as soon as possible, in the first two or three months of the new year, when there is a shortage of food before the new harvest, the future of the people's food in Shanghai will become more and more serious. At that time, the prices of rice at various levels will inevitably soar, not only will the poor people be cut off from wages and food, but also the general salaried class will have nothing to live on. Therefore, the future of the people's food needs to be planned and implemented now. I have been entrusted by all walks of life to handle it, and I will not live up to the false name. I will do my best to serve the public and comfort the expectations of all walks of life. Now, I am actively carrying out this plan, and as soon as the draft is completed, I will provide it to the authorities of the two concessions for long-term consultation and to discuss specific measures. I will definitely implement it, but although the two authorities have always thought about this, they have not been able to find a good solution, which is also what we understand.

Raising Funds to Purchase 200,000 Bags of Rice

Mr. Yu said that this matter is of great importance and cannot be achieved by one or two people alone. It still relies on the assistance of all walks of life, concerted efforts, and joint maintenance of the entire people's food in Shanghai. Therefore, it is decided that 200,000 bags of rice must be purchased, which requires a huge sum of 15 million yuan. If we do not invite the financial community to assist, we will not be able to sustain it for a long time and will only bear the name. We must also make a planned plan in advance, and at the same time, we hope that the gentlemen of the press will provide practical assistance to overcome the difficulties together. Regarding the authorities of the two concessions devising ways to hire special ships to transport large quantities of foreign rice to Shanghai for regulation, Mr. Yu said that there are many difficulties.

The Authorities Give Instructions to Suppress Rice Prices

After the rice market opened yesterday, the rising trend did not subside, and the market situation was still quite chaotic. Mr. De Kue, the Deputy Director-General of the Public Concession 工部局, telephoned the rice industry leaders Chen Ziyi, Zhu Zixiang, and Zhang Nianxuan around 11:00 AM, instructing them to meet at the 工部局 at 2:00 PM in the afternoon to discuss ways to stabilize the rice market. At 3:00 PM, Chen and Zhu went to the 工部局 to meet with Mr. De. Mr. De immediately discussed with them to find ways to stabilize the people's food as soon as possible, ban black market trading, and promised to provide more effective assistance. In addition, the Soybeans, Rice, and Miscellaneous Grains Association's afternoon trading has been ordered to stop.

The Discounted Rice Will Start on January 2nd

Regarding the eighth phase of discounted tribute rice, as it is in winter, the discounted rice association decided to start on January 2nd of the 30th year (i.e., the fifth day of the twelfth lunar month) to take care of the people's livelihood. The period is scheduled for 20 days. The two concessions will still set up 60 discounted rice distribution points, divided into 30 ticket sales and 30 rice distribution points. The Shanghai Rice Number Industry Association will be entrusted to appoint member firms to be responsible for handling. As for the discounted tribute rice required, it has been ordered by the association, totaling 300,000 bags. However, the funds still needed are hoped to be donated by all walks of life in a steady stream, and generously donated. It is also hoped that the rice industry will handle it impartially, so that the people can get real benefits, so that the funds are not wasted.

Measures for Transporting Rice in the Concession

The Rice Market Management Committee yesterday issued Public Announcement No. 168, stating: For the purpose of public announcement, the Public Concession 工部局 and the French Concession 董局面 have instructed that, in order to seriously handle the transportation outside the district, the following measures are specifically stipulated to facilitate transportation: (1) All vehicles traveling from Special Zone 1 to Hongkou or Huxi must hold an invoice or letter and first obtain approval from the 工部局 at No. 105, and then obtain a transportation certificate from the Political Department at No. 609 of the Central Police Station on Simalu. If the vehicle passes through the French Concession to Nanshi, it must hold a certificate and then obtain a iron gate certificate from the French Police Station in Lujiawan before it can pass. (2) All vehicles traveling from Special Zone 2 to Hongkou or Huxi passing through the Public Concession must hold an invoice or letter and obtain a transportation certificate from the Police Station in Lujiawan, and then hold the certificate to have the seal stamped by the Political Department at No. 609 of the Central Police Station on Simalu before it can be transported. If traveling to Nanshi, only an iron gate certificate is required. It is hoped that all colleagues will follow the above certificate application procedures in order and comply with them. This is for announcement.

### Forty American Missionaries to Withdraw Within a Month

According to yesterday's news, forty missionaries and children belonging to the American Presbyterian Church will leave Shanghai on the President Coolidge liner this month to return to the United States. The Presbyterian Church has decided to send all American children within the church, regardless of whether they are accompanied by their parents, back to their country. At the same time, the travel expenses for the withdrawal of all members of the association will be appealed for government assistance, because all of the association's funds will be used for church work and positive Sino-US purposes.

### Yesterday's Meeting of Chinese Detectives: Careful Revision of Terms, Scheduled for Submission to Police Authorities Today; Bao Wen Expresses Willingness to Give Swift Consideration

Regarding the issue of improving the treatment of Chinese detectives in the Public Concession, the Municipal Council was awaiting the official submission of demands by the Chinese detective representatives yesterday afternoon for consideration. However, according to information gathered by a reporter from the Da Zhong News Agency, the representatives of the Chinese detectives from various police stations, after drafting the terms for improving treatment at a meeting the day before, originally planned to submit them to the police authorities yesterday afternoon to conduct negotiations. However, it was heard that some Chinese detectives still expressed objections to certain points of the terms, so they were re-discussed at 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon. It is now heard that these revised terms, in addition to being posted at various police stations, have been decided to be submitted to the police authorities this afternoon.

Yu Made Two Exhortations Yesterday

At approximately 10:00 AM yesterday, Yao Zengmo, the Chinese Deputy Commissioner of the Police Department of the Municipal Council, went to the Central Police Station to convey the authorities' opinions to all members of the "Chinese Detective Committee," exhorting them to act cautiously and consider the overall situation. The Chinese detective representatives expressed their acceptance. Several minutes later, Yao accompanied Yu Qiaqing, a Chinese Director, to the station. Although Yu had acknowledged the Chinese Detective Committee, he was not yet clear about the committee's working situation, so he earnestly inquired and sincerely discussed, informing them that any actions of the Chinese detectives would affect the security of the Concession and that the safety of citizens should always be the premise. He urged them not to be hasty in demanding improvements in living conditions, not to easily abandon their security responsibilities, and not to cause anxiety to citizens and merchants. All the Chinese detectives accepted this with enthusiasm, stating that the purpose of the Chinese Detective Committee was purely to improve the lives of the Chinese detectives and that it had no other purpose. Once the task was completed, it would be dissolved and a mutual aid society would be formed to promote the welfare of the Chinese detectives. Yu expressed his appreciation for the Chinese detectives and stated that the business community could also raise 50,000 yuan for the mutual aid society fund to show support. In addition to expressing heartfelt thanks, the Chinese detective representatives resolutely stated that the Chinese Detective Committee was willing to guarantee that there would absolutely be no dereliction of duty in the future, to live up to the earnest expectations of all sectors.

Authorities Express Sincerity

According to Major Bao Wen, Chief Inspector of the Police Department, he anticipated that after these demands were submitted, the Police Department and the Municipal Council would give them swift consideration. However, he pointed out that there would probably be no response today and that it would probably take several days to resolve completely. According to the situation this morning, it seemed that the sixteen Chinese detective representatives would submit the demands passed by all the Chinese detectives to Yao Zengmo, the Chinese Deputy Commissioner of Police, who would then hand them over to Chief Inspector Bao Wen, who would then forward them to Feli Pu, the Director-General of the Municipal Council. There was no indication of what action the Municipal Council would take. Major Bao Wen also stated that, "We are well aware of the difficulties of the Chinese detectives. Rice prices are constantly rising, and it is only natural that the Chinese detectives need a pay raise. However, we hope that the requests made are reasonable so that we can quickly agree to them."

### The Meilun Incident: Second Protest

Delivered to the Japanese Consulate Last Saturday

The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post" reported that the "Meilun Dasheng" ship, which was carrying goods back to Shanghai a month ago, was detained by a Japanese patrol ship off the coast of Zhejiang and escorted to Dinghai, where it has remained ever since. The U.S. Consulate in Shanghai once filed a protest, but the response received from the Japanese side was "vague and unsatisfactory." After prolonged consultations with Japanese officials to no avail, they filed a second, more forceful protest last Saturday, and are currently awaiting a reply from the Japanese Consul-General.

### Japanese Marines Obstruct Firefighting

The "North China Daily News" reported that yesterday (the 1st) at 1:42 AM, the Hongkou Fire Brigade received a report of a fire at a paper warehouse at Nos. 23-25 Tiantong Road. A fire engine was dispatched immediately. On the way, it had to pass through an area with Japanese barricades, but it was blocked and turned back by Japanese Marine soldiers stationed in front of the barricades. As a result, it was forced to take a detour of two miles before reaching Tiantong Road, missing the opportunity to extinguish the fire. The danger was extreme. Fortunately, the pile of paper had been emitting thick smoke for a long time before it caught fire. At the time, four people were trapped on the second floor of the warehouse, including an elderly man of 75, a woman, an infant, and another man. The ladder had been destroyed. The firefighters ascended a fire ladder to the second floor and rescued them all. The roof of the neighboring warehouse, which contained tea and other goods, was only damaged and was not affected by the flames. Twenty-five minutes after the fire engine arrived, the fire was under control. It was completely extinguished one hour and fifty-seven minutes later. On the way back, the fire engine had to pass through the Japanese barricades again. The Japanese sentry said that the firefighters had to dismantle and reassemble the barricades themselves before they could pass. The firefighters complied to save time returning to the fire brigade.

### News from the Homeland Received by Polish僑 in This Port

Playing Works by Polish Musicians and Singers is Prohibited; First and Second Class Carriages Are Forbidden

A Polish reporter in this port received a letter yesterday from a friend in the homeland that had not been inspected. It described the recent situation in Poland after its demise. Currently, officials in the cultural and educational departments in Poland recently issued an order prohibiting the performance of musical works by the great Polish composer Chopin at concerts and in public places. The works of famous Polish writers such as Henryk Sienkiewicz and Władysław Reymont are also prohibited. Libraries and public reading rooms that contain these works have been ordered to confiscate them. Moreover, in order to make the Polish people aware that the current rulers are nobility, the German authorities of the Polish railways have ordered that Polish people are prohibited from entering first and second class carriages and cloakrooms. The methods of the secret police are extremely harsh. There are people sentenced to death every day. A Polish worker named Antoni Raga was executed for chatting with a German woman. Another German woman named Anna Buschud was sentenced to three years of hard labor for being friendly with a Polish prisoner of war.

### Although the Situation in Vietnam Is Tense, Shipping Is Very Smooth

Although the situation in Vietnam is tense, the shipping between Shanghai and Vietnam is still smooth and unimpeded. The French Mail Company's ship "S.S. Laos" arrived at this port at 8:00 AM yesterday from Saigon via Haiphong, carrying more than 16,000 bags of rice. It docked at the Shunxiang Wharf in Hongkou and will immediately begin unloading cargo ashore. According to the ship's crew, when the ship left Saigon, the situation in Vietnam was quite tense. There were no fewer than a dozen warships of the French Far East Fleet anchored along the way. The local area seemed to have fallen into a wartime state, but the people were calm and the situation was very peaceful. Furthermore, the company's ship "S.S. Sikiang" left for Saigon on schedule the day before after completing the loading and unloading of cargo in Shanghai. The "Bangkok" ship is also scheduled to return to Vietnam from Shanghai on the 4th. If there are no sudden changes in the situation in Vietnam, the shipping between Shanghai and Vietnam should not be interrupted.

### Within One Month, One Thousand People Froze to Death in the French Concession

Since the weather suddenly turned cold recently, the number of homeless poor and beggars who are sleeping on the streets and alleys of Shanghai and who have frozen to death due to hunger and cold has been seen in the reports of various newspapers in recent days. In the French Concession, in the past two days, reports from various police stations or store residents have indicated that the Tongren Fuyuan Sub-Hall has collected and buried a total of 22 large corpses (19 males and 3 females) and 43 small corpses. In total, since the cold weather first arrived this winter, the hall has collected and buried more than 270 large corpses and 730 small corpses from January 1st to the end of the month. However, the hall's expenses for the wooden coffins used to collect the corpses are enormous, and it relies entirely on donations from kind-hearted people. However, the price of wood has soared, and there are concerns about shortages, which could lead to a situation where there are no coffins available.

### After Zhu Boquan Was Kidnapped, the Driver Disappeared

The "North China Daily News" reported that banker Mi Boquan has been missing since last Friday, and the mystery remains unsolved. Although Zhu has been missing for several days, the Public Concession Police Department has not yet received a report, and the Mo family has not received a ransom demand. Zhu was kidnapped by three people near Haige Road, Yidingpan Road at around 9:30 AM on Friday morning. A peasant in the Western District saw a person being held by two people, struggling constantly. Later, Zhu's car was found abandoned in the fields behind Zhaofeng Park. The driver escaped from the car and returned to Zhu's residence, packed his luggage, and left. He has also been reported missing. People have been ordered to search for the driver's whereabouts, but there has been no news. Therefore, the truth of the case is unknown. On the first day Zhu was kidnapped, inquiries were made at Zhu's residence, but no news was obtained. The Police Department also has no clues and is at a loss as to how to start the investigation.

### The Blockade of Western Shanghai Became Even More Severe Yesterday; Remote Lanes and Small Paths Were All Searched Thoroughly; Residents in the Area Are in Danger of Starvation; It Is Rumored That Ten People Have Been Arrested by the Japanese

Since the attack on the Japanese military police on the 30th of last month, Japanese soldiers have blockaded the area bounded by Difeng Road, Daxilu Road, Yidingpan Road, and Yuyuan Road. All Chinese and foreign people in the area have been confined. Those who have left cannot go home, and those who have not left cannot leave their rooms. Since yesterday morning, the blockade has been tightened, leaving no gaps. Japanese military police and others are guarding every point. Except for those with special permission, all Chinese and foreigners are prohibited from entering or leaving. Since the morning of the day before yesterday, residences along Daxilu Road, Yuyuan Road, and Difeng Road have been searched. Each group consists of one Japanese soldier and two plainclothes Chinese. According to a Western reporter, Japanese soldiers and plainclothes Chinese went to his residence to inspect it, asking about his nationality and occupation, holding a pistol in hand, with their fingers on the trigger. Even narrow paths were all searched. It is rumored that ten people have been arrested. Public buses and trolleybuses did not run yesterday. Vendors transporting vegetables west to Jing'an Temple were also blocked at Difeng Road.

Residents in the Area Are Gradually Running Out of Food

According to general rumors, the Japanese army's blockade of the Western Shanghai area will likely not be lifted until the murderer who assassinated the Japanese military police is captured. It is said that the food problem in the blockaded area is quite worrying. Although it has only been three days, the tens of thousands of Chinese and foreign residents in the area are gradually in danger of starvation. A Western newspaper reporter managed to enter the blockaded area yesterday and met a beggar who told the Western newspaper reporter that he had not eaten for two days because the people who used to give alms were now worried about taking care of themselves. The Western Boys' Public School on Dunxin Road and the Western Girls' Public School on Yuyuan Road, which were originally scheduled to begin the entrance examination for the university today, have been canceled due to the Japanese army's blockade of the Western Shanghai area. Most of the students who went to the blockade entrance could not enter and returned home along the same route. St. John's University behind Zhaofeng Park has also been unable to leave the school to go to the Public Concession due to the blockade of Western Shanghai. However, there is one piece of good news, namely that since the Western Shanghai "歹土" area was temporarily blockaded by the Japanese army, armed crime in the Public Concession of this port has decreased sharply. There were only two petty robbery cases yesterday, indicating that the armed robbers are mostly from the Western Shanghai area.

A Rickshaw Puller Was Injured in the Thigh

The "North China Daily News" reported that yesterday (the 1st) at just after 10:00 AM, a rickshaw puller of a police car on Yidingpan Road was injured in the thigh by a Japanese soldier due to a misunderstanding. The rickshaw puller of the police car parked on Yidingpan Road at the location designated by the Japanese military police. After a while, another Japanese military policeman ordered him to drive the car away. The rickshaw puller apparently did not understand and hesitated, causing his thigh to be hit with the butt of a gun by the Japanese soldier. He was seriously injured and an ambulance was called to take him to the Huade Road Police Hospital.

The Japanese Soldier Who Was Shot Is Rumored to Have Died

The Japanese are now implementing a blockade, and the Chinese residents in the Western District are quite panicked, mostly believing that the Japanese blockade this time will be more severe than the previous one. Therefore, they are rushing to buy food to prevent running out of supplies. Yesterday, rumors spread that the Japanese soldier who was assassinated on Saturday had died of his injuries, but this has not been confirmed. It is also rumored that the Japanese have arrested nine suspected Chinese and one Russian related to the shooting, but the Public Concession police have no news about this.

Female Switchboard Operators Are Trapped in the Company

The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post" reported that after a Japanese military policeman was assassinated on Daxilu Road on Saturday afternoon, the Japanese immediately blockaded the Western District, and the Lusain Road branch of the Shanghai Telephone Company in the Western "歹土" area was also trapped. As a result, five Western female employees and 70 Chinese female switchboard operators in the branch could not leave their posts. Today (the 2nd) marks the third day since New Years. The five female employees are Ms. Miller (American), Ms. Etherton (British), Ms. Remedio Magri (both Portuguese), and Ms. Khuskova (Russian). The telephone company has rushed food, bedding, and cots to the branch so that they can continue to stay at their posts. The Japanese soldiers do not allow them to leave the branch. The Telephone Company's business department is shipping a large amount of food for relief.

General Manager Johnston told reporters this afternoon that the female employees are doing their best and working non-stop. He hoped that telephone users would not make calls beginning with "2" unless absolutely necessary to reduce the heavy workload of the Lusain Road branch. In addition to beds, the telephone company also sent several bags of 80-pound rice, snow cream, soap, toothbrushes, wool blankets and other sanitary products, vegetables, bread, tea, biscuits, and chocolate candy, all loaded in a truck, escorted by four Westerners. They went to the barricades on Daxilu Road, explained their destination to the sentries, and were allowed to proceed, following Dunxin Road to Lusain Road, stopping at the street corner, about 100 yards from the branch. The items were all carried to the branch by several people. The female employees welcomed the arrival of the supplies.

The Blockade Is Tight and Traffic Is Cut Off

The Japanese are still implementing a blockade in the Western District, and there is no sign that it will be lifted. Chinese are not allowed to enter or leave. Foreigners must show their passports to the armed Japanese soldiers before they are allowed to pass. The blockade methods are constantly changing. As of this afternoon, Yuyuan Road and Daxilu Road were completely blocked from Jing'an Temple to Yidingpan Road. Vehicles and pedestrians are generally not allowed to pass. Foreigners are allowed to enter the area from Jessfield Road or Haige Road, but they must show their passports. Chinese are all blocked in front of the barricades. Public bus service to Zhaofeng Park has also been suspended.

Chinese Residents Are Rushing to Buy Food

Japanese military police are constantly searching back and forth in the blockaded area, hoping to capture the assassin who murdered the Japanese military policeman. It is rumored that the Japanese have arrested ten suspects and are interrogating them. However, officials neither deny nor confirm this claim. This morning, Chinese residents in the "歹土" area continued to rush to buy food to prevent a long-term blockade. In the past month, the Japanese had previously blockaded the Western District because another Japanese soldier was assassinated there, and did not allow food to be transported in, resulting in the starvation deaths of several people.

### Number of Houses Destroyed by Fire in the Ningbo Plague Area: 137

According to a telegram from Ningbo, a plague unfortunately broke out in the Donghou Street, Kaiming Street, and Zhongshandong Road areas of Ningbo at the beginning of last month. The Yinxian County Government immediately organized an epidemic prevention department in conjunction with health technicians and relevant agencies to actively prevent and control the epidemic. As of the previous day (the 1st), which was exactly one month, the epidemic had been completely extinguished. In order to completely eradicate the plague, it was decided at an internal meeting of the epidemic prevention department to completely burn the houses in the epidemic area, and approval was obtained from the provincial government. The fire was set at 7:00 PM on the 1st, and preparations began at 5:00 PM. On the fire fighting side, the fire chief Wang Dashi personally led the firefighters to water the periphery of the epidemic area to prevent the fire from spreading. On the security side, Chief Inspector Lu led the entire security team and the chiefs of the 123 police stations to guard the main roads, alleys, and lanes, prohibiting pedestrians from passing and temporarily cutting off traffic. Commissioner Yu, the county head, personally supervised the fire, which was set at 7:00 PM by the members of the public works team led by Chief Ni and Technician Wang at the designated ignition locations. For a time, the fire illuminated the sky. After about two hours, a total of 115 households, totaling 137 houses, were burned down.

### The Municipal Council Responds to the Reason for Telephone Price Increases: Telephone Price Increases Are Imminent; the Municipal Federation Still Hopes to Reconsider

The Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation sent a letter to the Municipal Council requesting reconsideration of the excessive telephone price increase, which users could not afford. It is learned that the Federation has received a reply from the Municipal Council, which stated in brief: "We have received your letter of November 26 protesting against the telephone price increase approved by this Bureau, stating that this Bureau has not provided a detailed explanation on this matter. We are now enclosing a copy of the notice published in the newspapers and in the Bureau's gazette on November 27, which details the reasons for the telephone price increase. I hope you will check this. From this, it can be seen that the Public Utilities Committee of this Bureau has studied this issue in detail and considered it carefully. Therefore, the telephone price increase is currently necessary and reasonable." According to a spokesman for the Federation, the implementation of the telephone price increase is imminent. For the sake of public utilities and the future of industry and commerce, we still hope that the Municipal Council can comply with the situation and not miss the last opportunity for reconsideration at the Board of Directors meeting on Wednesday, and substantially reduce the excessive price increase to satisfy public expectations.

### Affected by the Foreign Exchange Squeeze, the Cost of Living Rises Again; The Selling Prices of 洋 Rice and Coal Briquettes Are Both Affected; Clothing and Daily Necessities Have Also Generally Increased in Price; The Workers' Cost of Living Index for Last Month Increased Dramatically

The Shanghai Workers' Cost of Living Index and Retail Prices for November 1940: The cost of living for the workers in Shanghai in November increased again. The food index for October was 586.74, and this month it exceeded the 600 mark. Compared with the previous month, the indices for clothing increased by 25.64 points, fuel by 25.63, food by 18.23, and miscellaneous items by 12.71. Compared with the base period of 1936, the food index in November reached 604.97, fuel 540.74, miscellaneous items 458.00, clothing 377.69, rent 348.19, and the total index was 540.62. This is an increase of 16.19 points compared with 524.43 in the previous month. The purchasing power of the national currency, according to the 1936 currency value, was 19.7 cents last month, but this month it fell to 18.5 cents.

The Base Value of Rice and Coal Is Too High

In addition to other factors, the squeeze in the foreign exchange rate has had a greater impact on workers than before. Because of the shortage of domestic rice, the workers' union relies entirely on foreign rice. The production of huaji, firewood, rice straw, waste firewood, etc., is largely replaced by coal briquettes. However, the weight of firewood and rice in the index is relatively heavy. Therefore, the foreign exchange rate has an increasingly important impact on the lives of workers. Apart from these two, other items in each category that are affected by the foreign exchange rate are also numerous, but not to the same extent. At the beginning of this month, rice prices were very high and then gradually decreased. On November 5, they rose again. On the 11th, the exchange rate was greatly reduced, and although the time was very short, it was enough to affect the increase in rice prices. On October 2, the average price of japonica rice was 81.87 yuan per stone, and the price of Saigon rice was 66.87 yuan. The former increased by 3.17% compared with the previous month, and the latter increased by 1.03%. Although the increase was not severe, the base value was already high, which was really unbearable for workers. On November 8, the price of coal briquettes increased from 7.20 yuan per load to 7.60 yuan. From the 23rd, it increased again to about 8 yuan. The average price this month was 7.58 yuan, an increase of 7.05% compared with the previous month. The prices of fish and meat have all increased.

This month, the selling price of fresh pork reached an unprecedented high. The price of meat was even higher than the price of chicken. The reason is that the supply is small and the commissions charged by market brokers are extremely high. Pork is the main meat food of the Chinese people. The price is so high that the middle and lower classes have long regarded it as a luxury, let alone the workers. However, the even distribution of food and the appropriate amount of meat are very important in terms of nutritional efficiency. With pork increasing by 29.08%, beef, salted pork, and lard followed suit, increasing by 16.64%, 26.16%, and 30.24%. The price of salted white fish increased even more, by 39.16%. The prices of fresh duck eggs and salted mustard continued to rise, increasing by 12.59% and 14.7%.

Among the vegetables, spinach, green vegetables, and white grapes increased by 49.25%, 20.48%, and 19.14%.

Winter Is Approaching and Cloth Prices Are Also Rising

Winter is approaching and the demand for clothing is increasing. Among the clothing, except for thread, the prices of various items have generally increased. Fine cloth increased by 16.76%, twill cloth by 10.60%, and the price increases of other items varied, from 2.63% to 8.38%. Among the fuels, in addition to coal briquettes, charcoal and waste firewood increased by 32.83% and 15.38%. Among the miscellaneous items, the supply of rough paper was extremely short, increasing by 41.30%. Cigarettes continued to rise by 4.05%.

Shanghai Workers' Cost of Living Index for November 1940

New base period: 1936 = 100

The percentage reduced

Note: This index is compiled based on the living standards of workers before the war in 1936. Recently, with the increasing cost of living and the decline in living standards, the cost of the degree of reduction in November of this year has increased by 3.91 times.

### Telegram from Huangyan Requesting Relief

Sexual Health

### Hindrances to Marital Happiness

— Huang Zhongchang, American Medical Doctor

The Evils of Self-Abuse in Youth

After excessive masturbation, frequent seminal emissions can erupt. However, if there is congenital deficiency or acquired imbalance, one can also suffer from this in youth due to hormonal stimulation in the body, resulting in frequent nocturnal emissions. Additionally, some people overexert themselves during the day and experience seminal emissions without dreams during deep sleep. They are completely unaware of the emission until they wake up in the morning or later and notice that their underpants are soaked with semen, realizing they had a nocturnal emission the night before. Furthermore, there is a condition called spermatorrhea, which is less common than the above two, but its harm is far more severe.

Although nocturnal emission is not considered significantly harmful, if it occurs frequently and is left unaddressed, or if it leads to masturbation, then nocturnal emission can turn into spermatorrhea very quickly.

Modern medical experts, aside from arguing whether nocturnal emission is a disease, unanimously agree that both nocturnal emission and spermatorrhea are harmful to the body and should be treated early, which is an ironclad rule and need not be repeated.

Based on my clinical experience treating several patients over the years, even with the newest treatment methods, the most effective medications, and diligent health maintenance, complete cure takes at least five weeks. For those with severe conditions, treatment for half a year or even a year is common. However, they ultimately break free from the illness and regain their health. Therefore, a patient with seminal emission can rest assured and will not be disappointed.

Speaking of treating this condition, the first thing is to strictly prohibit excessive sexual activity, avoid anxiety, and avoid excessive physical exertion. Especially, practice gymnastics, cold water friction, and regulate bowel movements. At the same time, take three "Nair-Er Seminal Emission Pills" before bed, which calm the brain, strengthen the seminal gate, restore the ejaculatory center's control, and stop seminal emissions. If the seminal emission is caused by masturbation, then masturbation should be stopped.

If the body is too weak or has neurasthenia, actively take the testicular essence preparation "Bu Ti Kang" [Body Supplement Kang], especially for conditions caused by prolonged seminal emission such as incomplete development, pale complexion, weak brain, and forgetfulness. After undergoing "Bu Ti Kang" therapy, one feels refreshed and energized. However, because patients are eager for treatment and cannot focus their minds, they are easily persuaded by others to purchase ineffective and inferior medications on the market. I have found several cases where this delayed the condition, and many have reported this situation to me. Therefore, I specifically mention this to remind patients to pay attention.

### Case Records of Sexually Transmitted Disease Treatment

— Zheng Ting, German Medical Doctor

Recovery from Injury

Patient Lu Fudi, 34 years old, from Nanjing, Jiangsu (Symptoms) — Pale complexion, emaciated muscles, frequent headaches, occasional insomnia, but no seminal emission. Premature ejaculation during intercourse, impotence, sometimes able to have an erection, but completely lacking vigor, and symptoms such as lower back pain, and weak limbs. Poor appetite. Weight 118 pounds. (Treatment Method) During treatment, sexual activity was strictly prohibited. A large amount of testicular essence preparation "Bu Ti Kang" for men was administered to improve energy, enhance libido, and promote metabolic function. After one month, the patient felt refreshed, headaches disappeared, and appetite improved. Although erectile function had recovered, sexual activity was still strictly prohibited. After the second month of taking the medication, everything seemed more optimistic. Weight exceeded 120 pounds, muscles gradually became stronger, complexion became ruddy, and lower back pain disappeared. After taking the medication for another two months, during which he had intercourse once, there was no premature ejaculation. I then advised him to have intercourse no more than six times per month.

### Current Treatment of Leukorrhea in Germany

— Wang Kechun, German Medical Doctor

Europe is a region where venereal diseases are prevalent. Due to environmental needs, there is a group of conservatives who advocate for a compromise method, using a combination of penetrating wax sterilization and anti-gonococcal therapy. This treatment, which is neither fish nor fowl, has long been despised by enlightened individuals, and tens of thousands of patients suffer from it every year. Upon investigation, the basis of this therapy is merely an imitation of Dr. Peter's theory of treating gonorrhea in Germany, which is truly a case of "drawing a tiger and ending up with a dog." Dr. Peter is the director of the Berlin Venereal Disease Hospital and the head of the Department of Gonorrhea. Based on clinical experiments and years of painstaking research in the chemical laboratory, he invented a new chemical therapy mixed preparation called "Ke Lin Nong," which is renowned in the medical community and praised by doctors from various countries. This agent is specifically for acute and chronic gonorrhea in men and women and excels in fighting gonorrhea and sterilization. It has absolutely no side effects and can elevate the body's special anti-gonococcal toxins to produce the greatest phagocytic function of gonococci. Therefore, all leukorrhea can be cured in a short period of time and will never recur for life. However, to expedite the effectiveness of treating gonorrhea in men, "Anti-Gonorrhea Water" can be used externally at the same time, following the diagrams and instructions for secret self-treatment at home. For leukorrhea caused by gonorrhea in women, "Ka Er Xue Di Vaginal Tablets" can be used externally as vaginal suppositories, which are washed away the next morning. However, when purchasing "Ke Lin Nong," be sure to recognize the three characters "Ke Lin Nong" and do not mistakenly believe others and rashly purchase cheap, inferior medications, which can harm the condition. Recently, some people have complained to me that they purchased other medications by mistake when purchasing "Ke Lin Nong" and experienced danger.

### Gonorrhea Lecture

— Yao Juyan, Physician

Clinic: No. 9 Ningbo Road, intersection of Sichuan Road

The Perilous Situation of Youth Diseases Regarding Leukorrhea

It has been said that in Germany, among ten young men, seven or eight have had gonorrhea. It seems that one cannot become a university student without having gonorrhea. However, if young people suffer from leukorrhea and still neglect to treat it, it will inevitably lead to unimaginable dangers in the future. The reason why many young German students do not develop into severe cases is because of the progress of medicine in their country. On the contrary, many young people in our country are troubled by the hidden disease of leukorrhea, struggling with this demon every day without any way to recover. According to Dr. Hibson of Germany, gonorrhea patients often lose their reproductive ability because gonococci escape into the internal reproductive organs. It can also invade the joints and cause arthritis, thus losing the freedom of movement. Therefore, the patient has no marital pleasure and no ability to participate in social activities. However, these chronic and stubborn cases of leukorrhea have recently greatly decreased because of the latest invention of German induction electrostatic therapy and X-ray therapy, combined with a special medicine for gonorrhea, which can thoroughly achieve a radical cure. Also treats syphilis, chancroid, and neurasthenia. Twenty patients are seen daily, each consultation costs only five jiao, and a complete book on gonorrhea is given as a gift.

### Pulmonary Tuberculosis

— Sheng Zaiqiang, Physician

A certain gentleman suffered from tuberculosis. After an X-ray examination, I found many cavities in the right lung, resembling a honeycomb. The condition was truly hopeless. I made the greatest effort to inject tonics and administered "Bu Fei Na Er" [Lung Supplement Na Er]. After two weeks of diligent treatment, the symptoms improved. I continued this treatment method, administering "Bu Fei Na Er" daily. After two months, the entire lung disease was completely cured. After half a year of recuperation, the body became strong and the weight increased by more than thirty pounds compared to when he was ill. This is because "Bu Fei Na Er" not only has the effect of eradicating tubercle bacilli but also has the effect of filling lung cavities. Therefore, it has such great effects. Other conditions such as senile asthma and infantile whooping cough can also be cured with "Bu Fei Na Er."

### Western Newspaper Reporter Witnesses Remains of Blown-Up Train on Way Back to Shanghai; All Lying on Right Side of Road Extending Hundreds of Yards; Total Dead and Injured Approximately 300

The English-language "China Press" reports: A reporter returning to Shanghai this morning passed through Suzhou and witnessed the wreckage of the Shanghai-Nanjing train, which was blown up by landmines planted by Chinese guerrillas last Friday. The wreckage lay on the right side of the road, extending hundreds of yards. The engine was blown and bent into a horseshoe shape, and the train was shattered. Rescue teams are still excavating bodies because it is believed that another 25 people are buried under the wreckage. To date, a total of 75 people have died. It is expected that when all the bodies are found, the number will increase to 100. There are 200 injured, many of whom are seriously injured and are being treated in Suzhou hospitals. The force of the landmine was very strong, apparently derailing the engine and the first five carriages, which fell down a 15-foot slope beside the roadbed. The engine has become a pile of scrap steel, and the wooden carriages have been shattered into pieces, scattering hundreds of yards away. It is reported that the Japanese authorities will provide compensation for the casualties. Although train traffic has returned to normal, trains are traveling very cautiously for fear of more landmines nearby.

### Xu Xiaopu's Clinic Burglarized; Grand-Nephew Turns Himself In; Xu Runyu and Classmate Liu Yong Conspired to Steal; Cash Used Up, Handgun Also Sold

Xu Xiaopu, a pediatrician, lives at No. 217 Mu'er Ming Road, and his clinic is also located there. On the night of September 7th of this year, 2,675 yuan in legal tender and a "Qiu Bie Tuo" handgun with seven bullets, which were kept in the desk of his clinic, suddenly disappeared. The Jing'an Temple Police Station was notified and sent detectives to investigate. They saw that the glass window of the clinic was broken. The thief seemed to have broken in from outside, so they took fingerprints and brought them back for comparison. More than two months have passed without any clues. Unexpectedly, at around 9:00 PM last night, Xu Xiaopu's nephew, Xu Xingsheng, brought his son, Xu Runyu (21 years old, from Shanghai, Xu Xiaopu's grand-nephew), to the Jing'an Temple Police Station to confess that Xu Runyu was responsible for all the legal tender and the handgun. Xu Runyu had been arrested last year for fraud and theft and sent to court, where he was sentenced to 20 days of detention, with a one-year probation. Afterwards, he committed the crime of defrauding his father of a radio, but his father withdrew the charges and sent him to the New China Traditional Chinese Medicine School at No. 19 Wangjia Warehouse to study medicine in the hope of further education. Unexpectedly, Xu Runyu indulged in base habits and conspired with his classmate Liu Yong to sneak into his great-uncle Xu Xiaopu's clinic on the night of September 7th. Because Runyu often went in and out of Xu's house and was familiar with the route, and the key to the door had already been prepared, he was able to pass through unhindered and obtained the loot. However, fearing that his family would find out, he deliberately created a false impression by breaking the glass window. He and Liu Yong spent the stolen money on prostitution. In a few months, they had squandered it all, and Liu even took the handgun to sell it in Nanshi. After learning the above, the police station detained Xu Runyu. This morning, he was sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court. The police station lawyer Li Zhishan stated the previous situation and requested a postponement. After the investigating judge briefly questioned him, he ordered him to be detained for seven more days for further questioning.

### French Authorities Award Medals to Meritorious Police Officers

(2) Chinese police sergeant No. 283 Wang Changsheng, deputy sergeant No. 103 Shen Jinmao, and Chinese police officer No. 154 Kang Chengqi learned on November 22nd of this year that an armed robber was fleeing on Hua Ge Niao Road. They bravely pursued him together. The two sides exchanged gunfire, but the robber was eventually shot down in the Public Concession.

### Compensation Granted After Death Caused by Theft Case

The employees of Yangzhen Ginseng Shop, No. 403 Fada Road, were robbed by three armed thieves on the 30th of last month, who stole more than 600 yuan in cash. Sun Buxiang, an employee from Ningbo, fought to prevent the thieves from escaping and ran to the adjacent Yuanshunchang Porcelain Shop to hide. Sun and Yan Zhongmin, an employee of Yuanshunchang, were mistakenly identified by Western police officers as fleeing thieves and shot and fatally wounded. The bodies were taken to the mortuary for examination. The details have been recorded in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that the bodies of Sun and Yan were each claimed by their families yesterday and transported to the funeral home for burial. It is reported that the police station and the Western police officers who fired the shots expressed their regret to the two shops and the families of the deceased. Because Yan died tragically, his family requested compensation from the police station. It is reported that the police station expressed their acceptance of this request and agreed to a peaceful resolution.

### Clothing Store Owner Encounters Robbery, One Perpetrator Apprehended on the Spot

Bian Yu'en Hong, the owner of Da Zhonghua Clothing Company on Fuzhou Road, lives at No. 21 Jingqin Lane, Guangxi Road. At 8:30 AM yesterday, several robbers suddenly broke in to commit robbery. While the robbery was in progress, Chinese detectives Zhang Keqin, Sun Dafa, and Chen Ruisheng of the Lao Zha Police Station learned of it and immediately rushed to arrest the robbers. At that time, one robber, Yin Liansheng, was carrying a Mauser pistol and fleeing from the victim's house. He was apprehended by the detectives and a Mauser pistol and ten bullets were found. He was taken back to the police station. After his confession, accomplices Deng Tiecheng, Pan Derong, and a woman Deng Xu (a masseuse) were arrested at No. 7 Qingcheng Lane, Shengmuyuan Road, and other places. This morning, they were sent to the Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police station lawyers Ru Bao Yi and Qian Xun Jiu requested a postponement because they still needed to investigate whether the suspects had committed other crimes. After questioning, the judge ordered them to be detained for further review.

### Arrested for Using Counterfeit Money

Wu Chunlin from Hubei, Wu Kangdi, and a woman Wu Chen, used a counterfeit Jiaotong five-yuan bill at Lin Li's noodle shop, No. 230 McTaggart Road, at around 6:00 PM one day. The owner noticed and reported it to the police, who arrested Wu Chunlin and the other two. They went to No. 300 Tangshan Road and No. 292 Dongjiaxing Road and seized one central five-yuan counterfeit bill, one one-yuan bill, four Chinese five-yuan bills, one hundred one-yuan bills, two hundred forty-four Farmers five-jiao bills, and twenty central five-fen coins. The suspect Ma Hongsheng from Changzhou was also arrested and taken to the Huishan Police Station. This morning, they were sent to the First Special Court. Police station lawyer Jiang Baolian explained the case and requested a postponement. The large amount of counterfeit money was presented for inspection. Judge Huang Risheng briefly questioned them and ordered them to be detained for further verification.

### Jewelry Merchant Accused of Debt, Large Amount of Rough Stones Provisionally Seized

Chen Kaiqing, a jeweler living at No. 607 Aivenyi Road in the Public Concession, was recently sued by Wu Gengtang from Fenghua, living at No. 389 Mai'er Xi Ai Road in the French Concession, represented by lawyer Tang Youwei, to the Civil Court of the First Special Court for debt. The indictment stated that the defendant Chen Kaiqing was engaged in the business of selling rough stones. In March of the 27th year of the Republic of China, the defendant borrowed 16,440 silver dollars from the plaintiff, stating that he would use the money to purchase rough stones from Myanmar and transport them for sale, and then repay the loan, with a fixed monthly interest rate of 8%. Unexpectedly, the defendant sold the rough stones but did not repay the plaintiff's debt. Recently, the defendant purchased four rough stones from Myanmar, two of which have already been sold, and there are still two remaining. The plaintiff requested the court to provisionally seize them. Therefore, he requested the court to order the defendant to repay the loan and the fixed interest. The case was heard by Judge Tao in Civil Court One at 3:00 PM yesterday. The defendant Chen Kaiqing, accompanied by three lawyers, appeared in court and argued that the debt owed to the plaintiff, after a large portion had been offset, was only about 8,000 yuan, while the plaintiff had provisionally seized the defendant's goods worth hundreds of thousands, causing the defendant a great loss. The two parties and their lawyers argued with each other for an hour. The court found the case complex and the two parties held conflicting views, so it ordered a postponement for further hearing on the 16th of this month.

Education

### Parental Education

— Yang Tongfang

The Chinese people rarely have correct views on children. Traditional thinking only gives parents a narrow sense of familism, raising children merely as their own private property, discarding the responsibilities they should have towards the country and society. One must know that children belong to society, not individuals. The greatest significance of parents educating children lies in cultivating healthy members for the next generation of society, and considerations of benefit and harm should be placed on the entire society. Some compare parents to the sun and air; they give children the supreme vitality of life, nurturing vigorous and fresh cells for society. The duty of parents should be considered the most noble and greatest of all human activities.

Because of the importance of parental duty, countries around the world are working hard to promote parental education; if we want to cultivate healthy children, we must first create parents with correct thinking and rich knowledge.

The purpose of parental education is to provide parents with practical knowledge of raising children, so that they can understand the stages of children's physiological development, the state of various psychological activities, appropriate educational methods, and hygiene knowledge, in order to cultivate children who are healthy in body and mind. The scope of parental education is very broad, from conception to growth, from infancy to adulthood, and includes all knowledge related to nurturing and education. Because there are many areas of knowledge that parents need, it is also necessary to promote parental education. According to the research of modern educators, parental education should focus on the inculcation of child education and mental hygiene. Originally, many parents, because they did not understand basic educational principles and could not apply the principles of mental hygiene, regarded children as miniature adults and failed to follow the course of their natural development, providing appropriate preservation and exhibition, so that children's nature was not appropriately developed, and they cultivated the root causes that would make it difficult for them to adapt to social life in the future.

The task of today's parents is to absorb as much knowledge as possible about childcare and education. In addition, medical knowledge can solve children's health problems, art can inspire children's love of beauty, and eugenics can promote the inheritance of excellent traits. It is especially important to have a long-term vision, correct past misconceptions about children, deeply recognize the importance of parental education, assume the era's responsibilities that parents should bear, replace debt claims with emotions, establish a proper relationship between children and parents, respect children's personality and rights, and cultivate children's good habits so that they can adapt to society and serve the people in the future.

At present, most parents not only lack a correct understanding of children, but also lack preparation of various knowledge in the family. The poison of traditional thinking is deeply imprinted in their minds, and they shift the important responsibility of child rearing to school teachers and servants in the family, resulting in children developing various bad habits, or burying children's future due to excessive pampering. We have overlooked the education and upbringing of the most plastic period of early childhood, and we cannot provide children with reasonable care. This loss is irreparable.

In order to correct parents' misconceptions, provide various knowledge and skills for raising children, and promote parental education, it is urgent. I hope that parents who are doing it now and in the future can follow the path indicated by parental education and become ideal and virtuous parents.

Occupation

### I'm an Old Ten-Bucks

— Zeng Chengkang

I am a worker in the furnace room of a medicinal water factory in western Shanghai. The smell in the furnace room is really unbearable; it is said that this gas will rot the lungs; the medicinal water inside is also really powerful, touching clothes, touching skin, no politeness, it rots immediately. More than a dozen workers in tattered clothes endured the gas and worked carefully, and I am one of them. In addition to making medicinal water, I also have to add coal, and sometimes I have to climb up to people's big furnaces to look at the medicinal water. Damn it, my work happens to be more than theirs!

I earn ten yuan a month, having entered last year. However, I am naturally honest and don't know the ways of flattering and fawning. I only know how to work and don't invite the gentlemen to drink or offer them cigarettes, so they get angry when they see me. I also get a burst of anger when I see them.

Many co-workers, they are all new arrivals, some less than half a year, some less than two months, and they have all had their wages increased! I know Wu Lai Li specializes in flattering. He sometimes asks for leave to do private affairs for the gentlemen. Once, he carted a large iron bed from eastern Shanghai to western Shanghai, and then from western Shanghai back to eastern Shanghai, without complaining at all. The bed belonged to Mr. Yuan, and he was very happy. Lai Li's leave was not deducted from his wages, and adding it up, it was another ten yuan! Xiao Zhang and A Wang often invite Lao Yuan to drink, go to restaurants, and adding it up, it is also five or nine yuan. But how come the new batch is also getting five or five yuan increases? They don't invite Lao Yuan to drink or eat, and they don't do odd jobs for him, so how come they are also getting increases! At first, I was puzzled, but Lai Li told me: that Shaoxing person is the manager's brother-in-law, that Pudong person is recommended by the accountant, and that person surnamed Li is some relative of a major shareholder. Lao Yuan also has to flatter them; there is no need to mention increasing their wages. Lai Li also scolded me for being stupid, not understanding things, and not knowing how to offer some diligence. Damn it, I'm here to work, not to move houses and do private affairs for the gentlemen. I'm here to earn ten yuan a month, which is not enough to raise my little San Zi now, so where do I get the money to flatter? I only know how to exchange strength for food! No one owes me anything.

Strange: I've been here for more than a year, Lai Li came six months later, and his salary is fifty yuan now! Xiao Zhang and A Wang also have more than forty, and there are Zhang San and Li Si who have big legs and also have ten, forty odd. But there is only one of me! I work the hardest, have the greatest strength, and don't fear death like them when I work; my clothes are the most tattered, and I have the most scars on my skin. I'm risking my life; for my wife, for my little two-year-old, I work. More than a year! People who don't work or do things casually get a five or ten yuan increase; I'm still an "old ten-bucks"!

"Old ten-bucks", I don't know if this name is good or bad. Lai Li was the first to call this nickname. "Old ten-bucks!" he shouted, "Come, come, carry this jar of medicinal water out!" After that, the workers all called me "old ten-bucks". I thought and thought, and I always felt that "old ten-bucks" was not a good word. I get so angry that I want to quit. But, when I think of my wife and child, there's no way! May God help me earn a few more big bucks! May God not make me sick: May God let me be sucked dry by people forever! Until I'm left with a skeleton!

The words went into Lao Yuan's ears again. He sneered and said, "The Chinese only know how to pray to God when they can't think of anything else! Old ten-bucks, I'm going to take a few days off and recommend a worker, there are too many people here, I'm telling you, old ten-bucks! I want...."

### Poor Winter

— Wu Shutang

Winter is cold, the stomach is hungry, but you have to find a way to keep warm and fed.

In the morning, you push aside the tattered cotton wadding, or just a mat, and try to find breakfast first. Like a hungry dog, needless to say, eyes looking, while also having to use the nose, hands and feet ready. Quick, here it comes, a woman, lightning-like, sesame flatbread and fried dough sticks in hand, two and a half fried dough sticks, two incomplete sesame flatbreads, a breakfast is barely enough to fill the stomach.

It's too cold, really can't stand it, go beg for some rags, no, as long as it can keep out the cold, burlap sacks, torn clothes, that will do. As a result, I didn't get anything, but I heard words as cold as air: "Young man, why don't you do a proper business, specializing in snatching things to eat." His mother, I'll do it with you, don't want wages, but you say rice is expensive, unwilling to part with food; do small business, who doesn't have red eyes? But you also need capital. Full stomach, warm clothes, then it's good to do, who likes to live such a short life?

It's not that I haven't had the idea of finding work, and they're picking cotton again, (cotton clothes). Today buying rice, tomorrow picking cotton, but where do these cottons come from? Oh! Country people, one load two baskets, bicycles, covered with vegetables, sundries; it is like this constantly, less becomes more, weighed and packed into bundles, put on trucks, sent to somewhere like rice? Look, the "mediator" is here, hand to hand, a contact, a shout, a smile on the face, walked away, interesting, don't care what it is, go up to see what opportunities there are, the result is a beating, walked away in pain.

The smell of rice is wafting, the stomach is rumbling, it's lunchtime. What to do? Lunch delivery stalls have also been looked at, rushed forward, always empty. Said rice is expensive, the boss serves less rice. Still go to that doorway to see, what is poured in the bowl? Vegetable soup fish bones, but no rice. Okay, still have five cents, buy a tall steamed bun, and eat it with the leftovers.

What to do for dinner? A thought came to mind, got it, go to the roast meat shop doorway, like a hungry dog, watching carefully, an Ayi, six cents for three flavors, sorry, just pretend it's dinner

Winter is cold, the stomach is hungry, but you have to find a way. (Charitable assistance for winter clothing)

Hawthorne Detective Cases

### The Dancer's Ending

— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter XII: Report and Explanation

"Lilan went home a little before two o'clock. He must have heard. At that time, he probably took the knife, picked up his leather shoes, and quietly came downstairs. It just so happened that the raincoat man came in, and of course it was inconvenient for him to do it right away. But he must have thought that this was another screen, which further increased his determination to do it. I guess that while the raincoat man was talking to Lilan in the parlor, he may have been lurking on the stairs smoking all along.

"Later, the raincoat man left. So he came down. At that time, he must have put his leather shoes at the foot of the stairs, hidden the knife, held the cigarette holder, pretended to be very casual, and walked into the parlor.

"At that time, Lilan may have already walked out of the parlor, preparing to send the raincoat man out, but suddenly saw the old man coming downstairs, so she changed her mind and didn't send him off. She hurriedly retreated into the parlor. There is also a reason for this. I guess that the raincoat man may have given Lilan some legal tender – I believe the three stacks in the drawer are – at that time, Lilan casually put the legal tender on the desk. When she saw the old man about to enter the parlor, she rushed to put the legal tender in the drawer first. We can imagine her panicked state at the time. She didn't even turn the key on the drawer.

"Then the old man and her probably exchanged a few words, Lilan pushed the window open and sat down on the chair. It was at that time that the old man unexpectedly took out the knife and stabbed her. This action must have been very clean, and Lilan didn't even have time to call for help; maybe she shouted a few times, but the voice must not have been loud. After the old man completed the plan, he put down the cigarette holder and began to steal the ornaments on her body. This action must have been very fast too. He took the ring, bracelet, and earrings in his hand, took the murder weapon and hurriedly left the parlor. He didn't dare to stay any longer, didn't even open the drawer at hand, and forgot his cigarette holder. So this morning when he saw three stacks of banknotes in the drawer, he was stunned for a moment. He was clearly regretting his mistake, but at the time, relying on his quick wit, he pretended to be surprised by Lilan's negligence, and we were even deceived.

"The second step, he walked outside the parlor, put on the pair of leather shoes he brought down, and walked outside into the rain. At that time, because of the rush, he didn't even tie his shoelaces properly. Bao Lang, now you can understand the source of the mud on the shoelaces (184)

### Color Films May Not Dominate the Film World

— Zhaoji

Cecil B. DeMille, the directorial genius known for managing large scenes in an orderly manner, recently made some startling remarks during a break in the Paramount studio's lounge.

We know that he is one of the most outspoken figures in Hollywood against making color films, but he is also a major director and producer with the longest history and glorious position in Hollywood. Although his works are not very numerous, such as the recent film "The Iron Horse," his opinions are often adopted by company executives or valued by the film industry.

He said that color films are only suitable for certain types of films, such as those with many scenes of fields and mountain forests, which are indeed pleasing to the eye when colored. In addition, color is needed at most in fashion shows and scientific films.

Cecil B. DeMille said that detective films, horror films, and social films do not need to be colored, otherwise it will only reduce their advantages, because the photographic techniques on the screen, such as strong black and white contrast, have already completed the task of this type of film. Therefore, color films may not dominate the world film scene, and black and white films still have their special place.

Finally, he said that in addition to color films and black and white films, yellow films will also have a great position in the future. The so-called yellow films are films with screens dyed light yellow. This point has already shown its advantages in many educational films and singing films, and MGM is often inclined to this type of production.

### Zhang Yi's Performance in "Robin Hood" Is Difficult to Realize in the Short Term

— Ling Bai

Zhang Yi, like Wang Yin, gradually transformed from the silent film era, eventually establishing today's supreme position in the film world, so his film history is very long.

If analyzed, Zhang Yi's fame was built on his strong and burly physique. When he co-starred with Chen Yanyan and Zheng Junli in "Struggle," Chen Yanyan and Zheng Junli gained the nicknames "Little Bird" and "Tiger" respectively due to the matching personalities of the characters in the play, and "Lion" was added to Zhang Yi. Until now, people have not forgotten this story!

After the war, Zhang Yi returned to Shanghai from Hong Kong and was hired by Minhua Company as a basic actor, but apart from playing Zilu in "Confucius," there was no other development. This year, because Li Qi Nian starred in "The Female Emperor" in Yihua, there was no suitable male lead for a while, so Yihua invited Zhang Yi to guest star. As a result, his performance was quite satisfactory with his strong and courageous style.

It is precisely because Zhang Yi's style is different from that of ordinary young men that the "Chinese Robin Hood," which Yihua is preparing to shoot recently, could not be more suitable for him.

After a round of negotiations, because Minhua is also planning to start shooting the first work "Children of the World," Zhang Yi may participate in the performance, so it will be difficult to achieve in the short term. With Zhang Yi's lines, starring in "Robin Hood" can be compared with Fan Pongke and Elol Flynn, so we are looking forward to him being able to perform!

### Shanghai Opera School Will Perform Thinking of Mortal Life and Going Down the Mountain

— Yun

Thinking of Mortal Life and Going Down the Mountain is a famous Kunqu Opera performed by dan and chou, with unusually heavy singing, acting, and body movements. Now the opera school has specially invited Zheng Chuanjian, Zhu Chuanming, Wang Chuansong, and Li Jun to teach the opera, and it is scheduled to be performed in the daytime market tomorrow (4th). However, the school focuses on cultivating talents, so two male and female students will perform the opera, which not only gives students more opportunities for practice, but also avoids the monotony of actors and makes the audience feel dry and boring. The opera "Returning to Camp to Hunt" was taught by the old actor Guo Chunshan, and the opera has long disappeared from the red carpet, so the school specially hired Guo Jun to teach it, in order to promote and preserve it. The main play "Taiping Village" has more than 80 people, 16 female generals, heavy martial arts, tense and lively, and is very worth seeing. The plot of "Thinking of Mortal Life" is as follows: Young nun, Zhao's daughter, ordained in Xiantao Nunnery, Dharma name Sekong, when she grows up, she is unwilling to be mistaken by the black clothes. One day, taking advantage of her master and senior brother leaving, she privately escapes down the mountain. It happens that Bitao Nunnery has no monks, and they are also backsliders. The two meet at the foot of the mountain, and each expresses their innermost feelings. So a pair of bald heads became husband and wife.

### "Children of the World" Openly Invites Key Roles

— Xing

In addition to the male lead Zhang Yi, Minhua's new film "Children of the World" plans to openly solicit other female leads and important supporting roles from the outside world. Both men and women are accepted, but they must not only be fluent in Mandarin, but also be able to speak English. It is said that this film will be filmed with Mandarin copies at the same time, in order to enter and exit the international market. At the same time, for the convenience of the German director F.W. Fraile, the actors can speak English to avoid the disadvantage of communication. It is also said that Ying Yin may be invited to take on the role of the female lead.

### Portrait of Female Artists

(9) Murong Wan'er

Recently, a newcomer who is good at playing villainous roles has emerged on the stage and on the screen, and that is Murong Wan'er.

Those who have seen "Family of the Qinhuai River" on the screen and "Under the Eaves of Shanghai" on the stage probably have no one who does not praise Murong Wan'er's villainous acting skills? She — Murong Wan'er is indeed a very promising newcomer in the theater world. Roles of enchantresses and prostitutes, under Murong Wan'er's personality, are often played very vividly, as if she has at least five years of stage experience. In fact, she only left school last summer. She studied at Biwen Girls' School and joined the Shanghai Drama Art Society after graduating from high school last year, starting her drama career. In more than a year, she has successively performed in a dozen plays such as "Night Shanghai," "Flowers Splashing Tears," "Wu Zetian," "Regrets of the Late Ming Dynasty," "Love and Conspiracy," "Daughter Country," "Li Xiucheng's Martyrdom," "Working Women," "Sea Love," "Small Town Story," "The Great Ming Heroes," and the recent "Under the Eaves of Shanghai," mostly playing villainous roles. Although she has not been involved in the world deeply, she is smart, she can understand the personalities of people from all walks of life, and she has had ample opportunities to develop her talent in the Drama Art Society, so she has been trained to become an excellent stage actor.

Now, Murong Wan'er is one of the important actors in the Shanghai Drama Art Society. At the same time, she is also a basic female actor of Guohua Film Company. Her first work in Guohua is "Distant Singer," which will be released soon; "The Romance of the Western Chamber" and "The Way of Husband and Wife" are being filmed. In addition, she has guest roles in Jin Xing Company's "Family of the Qinhuai River" and Minhua Company's "Confucius." In today's lack of film talents, it is inevitable that Murong Wan'er will be more active in the film circle in the future.

Murong Wan'er has always loved film and literature equally, so in addition to filming and acting, she also tries to write from time to time. Her desire for knowledge is quite strong. On the one hand, she practices writing, and on the other hand, she chooses famous novels and literary works to enrich herself. Maybe she will become a female writer in the future!

In addition, she also likes to do needlework. These days, she is busy knitting wool sweaters, whether at home or backstage.

This year, Murong Wan'er is twenty years old and is from Shanghai.
