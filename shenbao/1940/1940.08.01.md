### New Chinese Economic Policy Achieves Significant Success

Chongqing: Following the recent resolution of the Seventh Plenary Session to establish an Economic Warfare Department, the National Government authorities are now actively engaged in preparations. President Chiang recently declared that in the fourth year of the war of resistance, military efforts would only account for 30%, while economic efforts should account for 70%. This view is shared by figures in both military and political circles. In this regard, the National Government has achieved significant success in Sichuan Province since implementing the new economic policy. For example, three years ago, there were only 30 small-scale power plants throughout the province, with a generating capacity of only 5,000 kilowatts. Recently, Yuzhong City alone has a power plant with a generating capacity of 12,000 kilowatts, and the generating capacity of various private factories, 8,000 kilowatts, is not yet included. Currently, the National Resources Commission is adding five power plants in the province. Furthermore, Sichuan Province had no metallurgical furnaces before the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, but now has twelve new-style metallurgical furnaces, including one with a capacity of 100 tons and two with a capacity of 25 tons under construction. In addition, the production of pig iron and the machinery industry have also made progress. As for the manufacture of munitions, in addition to the national armories, there are also many private small-scale factories currently engaged in production. (Havas dispatch of the 31st)

### Japanese Planes Attack the Capital Again Yesterday, Beipei Hot Springs Bombed, Five Planes Shot Down One After Another

Chongqing: This afternoon, several batches of Japanese planes were found flying towards Chongqing, so an alarm was issued. The first batch of Japanese planes bombed Beipei Hot Springs, the second batch bombed Tongliang on the Ji Rong Highway northwest of Chongqing, and the third and fourth batches heavily bombed the western suburbs of Chongqing. However, because the bombs dropped mostly landed in open areas, the number of casualties was very minor. The anti-aircraft artillery did not open fire to allow Chinese fighter planes to intercept. The alarm was lifted at 4:30 PM. (Reuters dispatch of the 31st)

Chongqing: At 2:30 PM this afternoon, the outskirts of Chongqing City were again bombed by three waves of Japanese planes. Bombs fell like rain, and a large number of houses were destroyed. Japanese planes also attacked various towns near Chongqing today, such as Tongliang, 50 miles northeast of Chongqing City, and Beipei, 50 miles due north, which were both tragically bombed.

### Most of Henan Province Still in Chinese Hands

Beiping: Today, travelers arriving here mentioned the difficulties encountered by the Japanese army in Henan Province, currently fighting against a large number of Chinese regular troops and guerrillas. Recently, the Japanese army attacked north from the Henan-Hubei border in an attempt to trap the Chinese army, using at least 250,000 troops, aided by tanks and aircraft. However, after fighting for several months, both sides suffered heavy casualties, and no progress was made. Most of Henan Province is still in the hands of the Chinese army. The main reason is that the Japanese army's forces are insufficient to cope. Almost every Chinese person encountered by the travelers in Henan possesses weapons. Although the equipment of the Chinese army is inferior to that of the Japanese army, their morale is very high and their discipline is good. They currently use mule carts to transport munitions. China seems to be relying on these for transportation. (Reuters dispatch of the 31st)

### Postage Increased

Chongqing: Officials have recently announced that domestic and foreign postage rates will be doubled from October 1st. Domestic letters, which cost five cents, will be increased to ten cents, and foreign letters, which cost thirty cents, will be increased to sixty cents. (Associated Press dispatch of the 31st)

### Japanese Military Police in Tianjin Question Chinese and British People

Tianjin: Japan's "espionage terror" has recently spread throughout North China. Chinese and British people in this area and in Beidaihe, a northeastern Tianjin summer resort, have been interrogated by Japanese military police. The arrests of British spy suspects that began in Tokyo last Saturday have recently spread to Tianjin. Two British and forty Chinese people have been forced to be interrogated by Japanese military police. Without waiting for the permission of the British authorities, Japanese military police entered the British concession and questioned a British woman and a British military officer. However, these two people were only questioned and not taken to the military police headquarters. Also, a British military officer in Beidaihe was also questioned by Japanese military police, but there have been no arrests or mistreatment of British people. This Japanese action began this morning. The forty Chinese people questioned were Salvation Army officials, all of whom were summoned to the military police headquarters. It is reported that they have all been released. (Associated Press dispatch of the 31st)

Editorial

### Britain on the Wrong Path

It has been said that "everything in the East will never be understood by Westerners." This is naturally an exaggeration, but if this is used to explain Britain's current diplomacy towards Japan, it seems to hit the nail on the head. Counting the things in the contemporary international community that have been laborious and unsuccessful, nothing is more so than Britain's diplomacy towards Japan. People like Craigie, who have been busy all year round, have never had the slightest gain. Their constant concern for improving Anglo-Japanese relations is much like the bluebird in a fairy tale, always transforming into the opposite thing at the moment of reaching it. This is not due to the clumsiness of British diplomatic skills. The main problem is that the old ideas of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance era still exist in Britain, so it cannot have a correct understanding of the current situation in the Far East.

Recently, the British authorities have repeatedly rejected Germany's "peace" proposals, indicating that they no longer have any illusions of compromise, but this is a conclusion exchanged at a great price. Two years ago - even a year ago, Britain's attitude was not so firm. And in the Far East, even though many prices have been paid, delusional fantasies still dominate the entire foreign policy. In the ambition of the British rulers, it is roughly thought that: first, Britain is at a critical juncture of life and death, and cannot increase frontal enemies; second, only concession can be exchanged for Japan's well-intentioned neutrality; third, the policy of concession can help the rise of moderate elements in Japan and prevent the recklessness of extremist elements in Japan. None of these are following the traditional ideas of the old era; following tradition, they ignore some new factors - such as China's resistance - and are not taken into consideration. Therefore, on the one hand, Japan is overestimated, and an inexplicable fear arises when hearing official reports of Japan joining the German and Italian sides; on the other hand, Japan is underestimated, and the fantasy that Britain's concession can influence Japan's national policy. In fact, the anti-British movement in Japan began before the outbreak of the European War, and Britain's retreat to Japan was not implemented only during the war against Germany. Therefore, the problems between Britain and Japan are currently related to the war in Europe, but in fact they are two separate things, and they are not necessarily as close as the figures in Downing Street imagine. And Japan's basic foreign policy is determined by the sum of the desires and strengths of the Japanese rulers themselves and the international relations of all parties, and is not influenced solely by the strong attitude of the British side. From the Anglo-Japanese Customs Agreement to the recent blockade of the Burma Road, every concession made by the British side has only resulted in more insults and greater threats. This time, the concession regarding the Burmese Road was less than ten days ago, and a large number of British overseas Chinese were arrested, and Cox's tragic death was promoted. Even if this is not frivolously regarded as Britain's own reward, it should at least make the British government and people seriously reflect.

Among the major powers related to the Far East, Britain is the most polite to Japan, and the most impolite are the United States and the Soviet Union. However, battles such as Zhanggufeng and Nomonhan, the abolition of commercial treaties, and embargoes have not provoked fierce retaliation from Japan. In the recent Konoe policy, it is said that the United States and the Soviet Union are important targets for Japan to adjust diplomatic relations. Britain has made the most concessions and given the most help to Japan, but it has only been hit repeatedly. The so-called promotion of friendship is still far away. Of course, Britain is currently at war, restraining Condor, and cannot move as freely as the United States and the Soviet Union; but a month ago, it was precisely when Britain was in a very dangerous situation, and Japan was unable to do anything. Currently, Britain's position has made significant progress, and its diplomatic operations have also made considerable progress. Why should it be so unnecessarily afraid of the shadows?

Now, London seems to have recognized the seriousness of the arrest of British overseas Chinese, and the public has also issued calls for retaliation, but it is still questionable whether the mistakes and prejudices of many years can be fundamentally eliminated by temporary stimulation. It must be known that this arrest of British overseas Chinese was carried out under the orders of the Japanese government, that is, the action of the Japanese government, and it may even be determined that it is part of the cabinet policy that Konoe is preparing to announce today. This is not like the previous anti-British movement in Japan, which can be blamed on the invading Chinese soldiers, and under the so-called "new system" regime in Japan, there will no longer be a confrontation between moderates and radicals. Britain's traditional view of the Far East has become completely outdated. If it does not adapt to the new reality and make a thorough transformation, sooner or later Britain will inevitably be forced to withdraw from the Far East. Don't you see that in the basic policy outline of Japan's new cabinet that was recently reported, Burma and India have been included in the scope of implementing Japan's ideals to build the Greater East Asia?

Previously, Britain's blockade of freight traffic on the Burmese Road was excused by the United States' unwillingness to provide Britain with a guarantee of assistance. This explanation may be accepted without reservation; then, since the US attitude is now firm and unambiguous, and new pressure has been re-applied to Britain, will Britain continue its policy of appeasement to inflict suffering on itself, or will it rein in its horses and change its course, it all depends on how the British authorities recognize this incident and how they choose to use it.

### After Representatives Sign the Treaty, the Pan-American Conference Declares its Closing, Secretary of State Hull Issues a Statement, the Achievements of the Conference are Economic Self-Sufficiency

Havana: After the representatives of various countries signed the final treaty, the Pan-American Conference was declared closed at 8:10 PM yesterday. Before leaving Havana last night, US Secretary of State Hull issued a statement summarizing the achievements of the conference, saying that this achievement is an economically self-sufficient organization, based on the principles of honesty, fairness, and friendship, for mutual interaction. At the same time, Hull also said that the American countries "have the absolute ability to defend their creeds." Cuban Secretary of State Quemba said in his farewell speech that there is no doubt that this conference has made a significant contribution to the goals of the Americas. (Associated Press dispatch of the 31st)

Havana: Before leaving here today, US Secretary of State Hull praised the American countries' decision to unite to protect the integrity of their countries. Hull told news reporters that the governments of the American countries have shown the world that their determination to firmly embrace the spirit and system of maintaining and strengthening continental unity is unwavering. Hull also sincerely and earnestly declared that no country in the Americas has the slightest intention of seizing land during the opportunity of the European War.

New York: Most of the radio commentators in the United States judged the outcome of the Pan-American Conference as an unquestionable victory for American politics. Some commentators said that the United States is the only country with the military power to implement the terms, which is why the United States has obtained a free hand in the defense of the Western Hemisphere. However, Williams said in his broadcast that the conference has not yet obtained what it hoped for regarding the issue of the transfer of ownership of European territories. If the method of American air force bases in Latin American countries south of the equator has not been properly negotiated, Americans cannot regard the overall situation as a success. (Reuters dispatch of the 31st)

Rome: Rogerio, a New York reporter for the Turin "Stember" newspaper, said that if any European country takes action against Dutch and French possessions in the Western Hemisphere, the United States is prepared to enter the war. Rogerio said that President Roosevelt and Republican candidate Willkie have the same views on the general impact of the European War. President Roosevelt and Willkie do not advocate intervention in the European War, but if the Dutch and French territories in the Americas are threatened, the United States will take action. (Associated Press dispatch of the 31st)

Main Contents of the Convention

Havana: The main points of the convention established by the Pan-American Conference are announced here as follows: (1) The American republics consider the fate of all territories of non-American countries in the Western Hemisphere and the situations that may occur that may destroy their sovereignty, and therefore unanimously condemn all acts of violence. (2) The republics recognize that the aforementioned transfer of sovereignty is contrary to the emotions and rights of the American countries to maintain their security and political independence, and therefore the American republics will not recognize or accept this transfer, regardless of its form. (3) The American republics reserve their right to determine whether any transfer affects the territory and political independence of the European countries in this hemisphere. (4) The American republics may establish temporary governments for the aforementioned territories until their actual governments are freely determined by their people. This action by the American republics does not contain the meaning of abolishing the principle of non-interference. If a temporary government is decided, the power will be exercised by one or several American countries. This measure is aimed at safeguarding the security of the American countries and the welfare of the people in the territories concerned. The convention continued to state the many rights that administrators must maintain, stating that open economic relations will be maintained by various countries on a mutual basis. The first government will be for a term of three years, which can be extended for a maximum of ten years. Local income will be used to maintain government expenses. The international committee responsible for local administration will be composed of one representative from each country that ratifies this agreement. Any contracting country may convene a meeting of this committee. All resolutions must be approved by two-thirds of all members of the committee. The convention does not have articles addressing the land disputes between European countries and American countries. This agreement will be implemented after two-thirds of the American republics have ratified it. This agreement reiterates the principle of the conference, allowing the immediate establishment of a temporary committee composed of one representative from each country, which can convene and conduct business with two-thirds of the members present. Argentina added a reservation, recognizing the Falkland Islands as part of Argentina's territory. (Reuters dispatch of the 31st)

### US Senate Military Committee Decides to Authorize the President to Summon the National Guard, President Roosevelt Reiterates his Belief in Compulsory Military Training

Washington: The Senate Military Committee yesterday postponed voting on the compulsory service bill aimed at registering 42 million men aged 18 to 64 for service, but has decided to authorize President Roosevelt to summon the National Guard. The Senate Military Committee has temporarily approved the main points of the conscription bill, but there is currently a growing opposition to the bill inside and outside Congress. The committee has decided to consider limiting the age of those receiving active military training from the current 21 to 45 to 22 to 31. (Reuters dispatch of the 31st)

Washington: President Roosevelt reiterated his belief in the enforcement of compulsory military training yesterday. The Senate Military Committee has already unanimously passed a proposal authorizing the President to mobilize the National Guard Reserve for one year of rigorous training. The President said that the current situation is different from when the United States could send troops abroad for training in 1917. Today, the security of our country lies in having an excellent army that can be deployed at any time. US Secretary of War General Marshall told the Senate Military Committee that if the United States needs an ideal army, it must actively train the people. He also believed that this cannot be completely dependent on people voluntarily enlisting. He said that although it is currently a "time of peace," "I believe that our country is in a dangerous period, and it would be a great crime to send inexperienced people abroad to fight."

### British-Japanese Agreement on the Burma Road, Britain Did Not Give the Japanese Authorities in Burma the Right of Inspection

### Vietnam Crisis: Only the US Can Resolve It; Vietnamese Governor-General Eager to Cooperate with the US; French Concerned About Sai Nguyen's Return to Japan

Hanoi - French sources here today are paying close attention to the visit to Tokyo by Sai Nguyen, the leader of the Japanese monitoring group in Vietnam. They say Sai Nguyen's trip may indicate Japan's future attitude toward Vietnam. Sai Nguyen left here by plane on July 28 and is expected to return next week. The Japanese monitoring group in Vietnam now numbers nearly one hundred, and they are all paying attention to the possibility of developing Japanese-Vietnamese commercial relations. Tokyo and Washington both hope to cooperate with Vietnam to enable it to realize its difficult task of new economic independence, free from the influence of France's surrender to Germany. For Vietnam itself, it must find ways to maintain its currency and quickly find markets to sell its coal, tin, rubber, rice, silver, and other products, as the 26 million residents of Vietnam rely on these goods for their livelihood. At the same time, consumption of goods imported from abroad is rapid, and during this time of European war, in order to avoid supply depletion, it must rely on imports from the US and Japan to replenish them. Vietnam's new Governor-General, Major General Te Go, met with a United Press reporter yesterday and outlined the current dangerous situation. Although he did not want the reporter to quote him in the news, he allowed the reporter to state that the Vietnamese government believes that Vietnam can establish economic relations with the US, Japan, Australia, and China, allowing the French to maintain their position in the East. Vietnam is still waiting for a signal from Washington. The French representative in Washington is hoping that Washington can lift the "freeze" on French deposits so that it can purchase urgently needed American products. Although French champagne is still sold for two yuan a bottle in Vietnam, Vietnamese French people can immediately switch to drinking American wine, but the supply of American wine is extremely scarce. A landmark in Hanoi is a replica of the Statue of Liberty, gifted by the French in New York. The French, touched by the scene, sincerely hope that the US can decisively engage in mutually beneficial commercial and political cooperation with Vietnam, so that Vietnam can receive equal treatment from the US and Japan. Neutral parties here point out that unless the US quickly attends to the crisis in Vietnam, this colony will inevitably be forced to completely lean toward Japan for economic assistance. If this is the case, it will naturally be unavoidable to cede some political interests to Japan. French officials have now indicated to Japan that they are willing to exchange Vietnamese coal, tin, and rice for Japanese products, but they are still hesitant in drafting a plan, fearing that the result will be that Vietnam's currency will be controlled by the Japanese yen bloc.

### British Believe the Japanese Arrest of British Nationals is a Serious Matter; Foreign Secretary Halifax Explained to the Japanese Ambassador; The Presumption of Guilt of Cox is Completely Unacceptable to Britain

London - Foreign Secretary Halifax, in response to questions about Japan in the House of Lords today, said that on July 29, the Japanese Ministry of the Army and Ministry of Justice jointly announced that, in view of the increasing number of spies and conspiratorial organizations within and outside the country, the military police, under the guidance of prosecutors, began to arrest members of a nationwide British spy network on July 27. Such remarks by the Japanese government are undoubtedly groundless. As for the tragic death of Cox, the chief correspondent of Reuters in Tokyo, the Japanese announced that he died after falling from the third floor and that it seemed that during the investigation, the deceased knew that he could not escape punishment, so he committed suicide to end it all. The British government completely cannot accept this groundless presumption of guilt. The British Ambassador to Japan, Craigie, has made serious representations to the Japanese Foreign Ministry. This morning, I asked the Japanese Ambassador to come and see me and made it clear to him that the British government has a serious view of the Japanese arrest of British nationals without any doubt. Furthermore, I am not at liberty to say anything more at this time. (Reuters telegram, July 30)

Japanese Spokesman Claims Rejection of British Protest

Tokyo - Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman Suma recently told foreign reporters that the Japanese government will refuse to consider any British protests regarding the Japanese arrest of British nationals suspected of espionage. Suma strongly stated that it would be a mistake to say that this sudden action by Japan was purely anti-British. It must be known that no matter what country's people, if they engage in espionage activities within Japan, the Japanese authorities must take action against them. When reporters asked whether Britain had protested to Japan about the Japanese arrest of British nationals, Suma replied in the affirmative, only saying that the British Ambassador to Japan, Craigie, may have raised the matter when he met with Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka on Monday. However, Suma also said that the talks between Matsuoka and Craigie on Monday were largely a continuation of the Japanese-British policy negotiations on Saturday and that Matsuoka had asked Craigie about some of the views held by Britain towards Japan. (United Press telegram, July 31)

London - Reuters diplomatic correspondents have learned that the activities of Germans in Japan, which have influenced recent Japanese actions, have been revealed in London. When the Anti-Comintern Pact was concluded, one German, a member of the German secret police, entered the Japanese Ministry of Home Affairs. This person has a great influence on Japanese domestic affairs and exerts great pressure on Japanese newspapers. The Nazi Party has a branch in Japan, controlling the activities of all German expatriates, which is tacitly approved by the Japanese authorities. The number of German tourists and businessmen in Japan has greatly increased, and they have no special reason for traveling to Japan. (Reuters telegram, July 31)

British-Japanese Committee Considering Dissolution

London - It was learned here yesterday that as a result of Japan's large-scale arrest of British nationals, the British Federation of Industries is considering dissolving its current British-Japanese Committee in both Tokyo and London. This committee was established in 1936 with the aim of increasing mutually beneficial trade between Britain and Japan. One of the thirteen British nationals detained in Japan on suspicion of espionage is James, the chief representative of the committee in Japan. (United Press telegram, July 31)

London - Four of the British nationals arrested in Japan have been released, their names being Holt, Chairman of the British Association in Kobe; Jones of Nickel & Lyons; Price of Butterfield & Swire; and MacNaughton, a British businessman in Osaka and Honorary Consul of Greece. As another British national, Ely, the General Manager of Asahi Oil Company, has been arrested, the total number of British nationals currently detained is ten. (Reuters telegram, July 31)

London - The British government has recently received a report from the Tokyo Embassy that Holt, the General Manager of the Butterfield & Swire company in Kobe and Chairman of the British Association, and Russell, a director of Nickel & Lyons and Chairman of the Kobe International Committee (born in Osaka in 1878, published a book on the history of Japanese customs), have been released, but Ely, the General Manager of Yokohama Rising Sun Oil Company, has been arrested in succession. (United Press telegram, July 31)

British Newspapers Condemn Japanese Actions

London - The British press has warned Japan that Japan's current pro-Axis policy and arrests of British nationals will lead to war between Britain and Japan. London's morning newspapers have unanimously written articles condemning Japan's mass arrests of British nationals and its agreement to form an alliance with Germany and Italy. The Times said that even if Japan's desire to build a so-called "new order" fails in China, the fact that Japanese foreign policy must always be dictated by warlords who attempt to bring Japan into war with other Pacific countries is still a shocking matter. The Daily Telegraph said, has Japan ever considered the possibility that the US and Britain might unite with each other to stop its aggressive activities? Has Japan ever considered that if a conflict occurs with Britain, the consequence will be the resumption of hostilities with the Soviet Union? The Daily Mail warned that Britain can no longer make concessions and will not tolerate Japan's arbitrary arrest of British nationals. (United Press telegram, July 31)

London - The Daily Express advocated immediately arresting a similar number of Japanese people in London and boycotting the import of Japanese goods into Britain. British intellectuals hinted at retaliatory measures and believed that the British government would find it necessary to re-examine its Far East policy.

Chongqing - Local newspapers here have written articles criticizing Britain in response to news of the tragic death of Cox, Reuters' correspondent in Japan, and the Japanese arrest of British nationals, saying that Cox's death and the Japanese arrest of British nationals are both direct results of Britain's conciliatory policy towards Japan. The Central Daily News also published a sharp editorial strictly commenting on British actions. The newspaper said that only ten days after the closure of the Burma Road, the tragic death of the British reporter and the arrest of thirteen British nationals have already occurred. Can the British Churchill government still remedy this situation with humble protests? "We dare to say that Cox's death and the arrest of thirteen people are all caused by the Burma Road agreement. The cunning British initially thought that the closure of the Burma Road would only harm China, but they did not know that what China suffers is only material loss, while Britain greatly loses its national prestige. Its foolishness is beyond reach. Britain should know that its recent humble behavior has already started Tokyo's gradual capture and killing of British people. (United Press telegram, July 31)

Commentary from New York and Berlin Newspapers

New York - The New York Times' editorial today, titled "Japan's Arrogance," said that the military arrogance of Japan is difficult for the West to understand. The Japanese plainclothes soldiers who invaded the Shanghai International Settlement were arrested by American sailors, which was considered an insult by the Japanese. When Washington indicated that it would no longer supply oil and iron to Japan to help it slaughter Chinese people, the Japanese were greatly angered. However, Japanese soldiers beating and insulting Westerners or kicking innocent Chinese people, and Japanese people in Shanghai beating and arresting foreigners on trumped-up charges, and foreign journalists in Tokyo committing suicide under police interrogation, are all considered by the Japanese not to damage Japanese honor. It is no wonder that Westerners continue to regard this Japanese military arrogance as a strange thing, as they do not know what is admirable. (Reuters telegram, July 31)

Berlin - Yesterday, local newspapers published detailed reports on the discovery of a large-scale British espionage organization in Japan and the suicide of the Reuters correspondent in Tokyo in a prominent position. The newspapers said that Japan's discovery of the British conspiracy was not surprising, as Britain had espionage organizations in the capitals of various European countries. It is satisfying that the Japanese military authorities were able to arrest the spies before they escaped. (Haitong News Agency telegram, July 31)

Tokyo - According to a Japanese semi-official statement released today regarding the death of Cox, Cox was injured in eight places and died at 3:46 p.m. on Sunday due to excessive internal bleeding in front of his wife and British Consul General Crowley in Tokyo. This tragedy occurred after Cox finished lunch, which was prepared at home and brought by his wife. Beforehand, Cox had written a few words on the margin of his wife's letter and put it in his pocket. When Cox was walking around the room, he suddenly jumped out of the window, which was opened by the military police to let in cool air. The military police guarding Cox were unable to stop him from doing this, which was at 2:05 p.m. Cox sustained eight injuries to his jaw and legs. First aid was administered in the medical room of the Army Police Headquarters, and three renowned surgical experts were summoned to treat him. They did their best, but he eventually died due to his injuries. Commander Hirabayashi of the Tokyo Military Police Headquarters expressed his regret over Cox's tragic death and ordered two guards to be stationed by the body to show respect. At 7:30 p.m., the body was sent to the British Embassy and then to Selbo Hospital. Commander Hirabayashi and his staff presented wreaths to pay their respects. (Reuters telegram, July 31)

Foreign Journalists Face Serious Danger

Local News - Reuters Far East General Manager Walker flew from Shanghai to Tokyo yesterday morning due to the Cox incident. (Reuters)

New York - Reuters Far East Manager Zhang Xuelou said yesterday upon arriving here that foreign journalists in the Far East are currently facing serious personal danger, especially in Shanghai. Although he did not clarify the nature of the danger, he was quite convinced of this statement. Speaking of the death of his colleague, Reuters correspondent in Tokyo Cox, who was detained by the Japanese military police two days ago, he said that he had doubts about the Japanese report that Cox's death was due to suicide. This kind of investigation of Cox will certainly not convince people. Cox did not engage in any work other than normal news reporting, and he never made any speeches or writings that would arouse the hatred of the Japanese authorities. (International News Service telegram, July 31)

### Cox's Posthumous Honors: Ambassadors from Various Countries in Japan Attended the Funeral; Japan Issued a Statement Saying He Was Injured in Eight Places

Tokyo - Cox's funeral was held at St. Andrew's Church at 5 p.m. today, attended by Sir Craigie, the British Ambassador, and his wife, the US and Polish Ambassadors, the Dutch Minister, and representatives of major Japanese newspapers, about two hundred people in total. All foreign correspondents stationed in Tokyo, except for those from Germany and Italy, attended. The pallbearers were Grant, a correspondent for Havas; Thompson, a correspondent for the Associated Press; Morin, a correspondent for United Press; and Lederman, a white man from the British Embassy. Cox's body has already been cremated, and the ashes have been temporarily placed in the Yokohama Foreign Cemetery and will be transported back to England in the future. (Reuters telegram, July 31)

### US Intensifies Preparations to Compete with Japan; Pravda Comments that the Contradictions Between the Two Countries are Sharpening

Moscow - Regarding the US ban on the export of scrap iron and gasoline, Pravda commented, "Japan is the largest customer of US scrap iron and gasoline. US gasoline exports to Japan account for 70% of Japan's gasoline imports. As for scrap iron, all of it is imported from the US. The abolition of the US-Japan trade agreement shows that the US is increasing economic pressure on Japan. President Roosevelt's recent order has given the US greater power to suppress Japan. The US will never give up its markets and position in China, and US exporters are willing to trade with both China and Japan at the same time, supplying both countries with military raw materials and armaments. US imperialists believe that if Japan does not completely control China, they can profit from the Sino-Japanese war. Although there have been recent changes in Japan, after the change of the Japanese cabinet, it has created the saying of "clarifying US-Japan affairs" and at the same time clamoring for expansion in the South China Sea. This has shocked the United States and intensified preparations to fight Japan. In short, the current stage of US-Japan relations has proven that the contradictions between the two countries have become more acute due to their attempts to compete for hegemony in the Pacific.

### US International Trade Council Holds Annual Meeting; Roosevelt Warns Those Who Advocate Abandoning Free Principles

San Francisco - President Roosevelt, in a message to the 27th annual meeting of the International Trade Council here last night, issued a warning to those who advocate that the US abandon its trade policy with democratic countries based on free principles. The message also stated, "A strong economic defense program is a major part of our country's defense program." In the message, the President also paid tribute to Farnell, the Chairman of the Trade Council, and said, "The so-called idea that we can adopt the controlled trade methods of totalitarian countries to avoid totalitarian countries controlling our domestic economy is purely an ideal."

### "Iron Lung Man" Celebrates Birthday; Walks Outside Iron Lung for the First Time in Four Years

Chicago - Snyder, the "Iron Lung Man" who contracted the disease in Beijing in 1936 and has since relied on the iron lung to live his life for four years, recently celebrated his 30th birthday, walking around the third room of his summer residence. This is the first time since April 1, 1939, that he has left the iron lung to hold his birthday celebration. He wore a special respirator today, allowing him to walk and breathe easily.

### Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria to Begin Negotiations; Based on Establishing Principles; Bulgaria and Hungary Achieve Their Wishes

Bucharest - Negotiations between the Romanian government and Bulgaria and Hungary will begin in a few days. These negotiations will be based on the principles established in Germany and Italy a few days ago. The Romanian-Bulgarian issue is relatively simple. Romania's Southern Dobruja Province will be returned to Bulgaria. Border exchanges, residents, and the date of handover will be discussed after negotiations between the two countries. It is reported that there were 366,000 Bulgarians in Romania during the last census. The province is located on the Black Sea coast and is an agricultural area, partly grassland. In 1938, it had a population of 900,000, of which 300,000 to 400,000 will be ceded to Bulgaria. The Romanian-Hungarian negotiations are said to be held in Arad, from which the Romanian troops will soon withdraw. According to the Treaty of Trianon, Hungary ceded 102,282 square kilometers of territory to Romania in 1919, with a population of 5.8 million in 1938. The land is divided into three provinces: Western Burgenland with a population of 3.4 million, Banat with a population of 900,000, and Maramures with a population of 1.5 million. According to a 1930 statistic, the area had about 1.4 million Hungarians and 700,000 Germans. A few weeks ago, newspapers claimed that the resolution of the Romanian-Hungarian issue and the exchange of residents were also important. Bucharest intends to demarcate a strip of land 80 kilometers wide on the border, while Western Burgenland will remain within Romanian territory. The two provinces to be ceded have railways connecting the four important cities in the north and south. The method of exchanging residents is that Hungarians living in other parts of Romania will be exchanged for Romanians in the ceded territory. It is expected that the negotiations will not arouse resentment among Romanians, as both sides have expressed their intention to resolve it peacefully. (Haitong telegram, July 31)

Bucharest - The situation in the Balkan Peninsula seems to have passed the negotiation stage. A Reuters telegram from Italy to the Bucharest Daily News stated that the Axis powers are limited to issuing friendly advice and are carefully watching the Southeast to prevent outside forces intent on preventing the resolution of existing disputes from interfering. On Sunday, Bucharest confiscated the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera, which is quite interesting. The newspaper contained an article stating that Romania should reach an understanding with Bulgaria. It is said that Bulgaria's claim to the Dobruja region extends as far as Mangalia and even Constanta. The Soviet Union supports Bulgaria's demand because Romania is taking a pro-German policy, while the Soviet Union wants to eliminate Italian and German forces in the Balkan Peninsula. The general Romanian newspapers welcomed and expressed satisfaction with the results of the Salzburg and Rome talks as briefly stated in the Romanian government communiqué and emphasized the importance of the role played by Romania in the reorganization of Southeastern Europe under the supervision of the Axis powers. A telegram from Berlin to the Romanian government newspaper stated that the German authorities considered it very important that British and French interests should be removed from Southeastern Europe and therefore welcomed the expulsion of French technicians and alleged conspirators from Romania, saying that this was clear evidence of the elimination of British and French interests. (Reuters telegram, July 31)

### Romanian Cabinet Meeting; Foreign Minister Reports; Visit to Germany and Italy

At the same time, Manolescu reiterated Romania's desire to live in peace with its neighbors. (Reuters telegram, July 31)

### Dismissal of Jewish Civil Servants

Bucharest - Last night, it was officially announced that all Jewish employees of the Ministry of Interior have been dismissed. It is reported that all low-ranking Jewish employees of other departments will also be dismissed. (Haitong telegram, July 31)

### Deteriorating Relations Between Britain and Romania

London - It was learned from official sources here last night that the British lodged a protest with Romania in Bucharest two days ago, mentioning the detention of British ships on the Danube, the expulsion of British technicians from Romanian oil companies, and the unwarranted interference in the administration of the British Astrea Romana company. The British dispatch pointed out that the Romanian government has taken arbitrary actions against British interests in the above-mentioned issues without fully discussing them with the British government. Unless the Romanian government gives the British satisfactory answers on these points, there is no hope for the restoration of normal relations between Britain and Romania. (Reuters telegram, July 31)

### South Slav Cabinet Likely to Be Reorganized

Capital of Yugoslavia - According to sources here, the main issue currently being discussed in the castle where Prince Regent Paul resides is the reorganization of the cabinet. The fact that the Prime Minister and several cabinet members are still in Brdo pri Kranju proves this. It is reported that Deputy Prime Minister Dr. Maček will also go. According to political sources, the current Foreign Minister, Dr. Marković, and the Minister of Education, Dr. Korošec, are both potential candidates for Prime Minister. (Haitong telegram, July 31)

### Hungarian Delegation to Moscow to Conduct Business Negotiations

Budapest - A Hungarian economic delegation of fifteen people departed from here today, heading to Moscow via Berlin. The leader of the delegation is Nylky. It is reported that after their arrival in Moscow, they will conduct business negotiations, the main purpose of which is to try to purchase raw materials from the Soviet Union for the development of Hungarian industry. (Haitong telegram, July 31)

Budapest - The Hungarian Foreign Ministry's mouthpiece, "Lloyd's Newspaper," published an article yesterday refuting the claims by Britain and France that Hungary's draft autonomy for Carpathian Ruthenia is an effort by Hungary to adjust Soviet-Hungarian relations. The newspaper strongly stated that Hungary's relations with the Soviet Union are extremely friendly and there is no need to adjust them at all, and that the Soviet Union's policies towards the Axis countries and Hungary are extremely correct. The main purpose of Hungary's foreign policy is to seek coordination with the Axis countries. As the Soviet Union and Germany and Italy are cooperating closely, there is no need to adjust Hungary's relations with the Soviet Union at all. (Haitong telegram, July 31)

### Syria Situation Chaotic, Governor-General Recalled, French Officers Flocking to Join British

London – Reuters special correspondent on the Palestine-Syria border reports that rumors of unrest in Syria are untrue; the region remains peaceful, but the situation is chaotic. Many French officers have crossed the border to join the British forces, but most are still on duty. Soldiers recruited from Egypt and elsewhere have been dismissed. The precarious financial situation in France is severely affecting Syria. The franc is falling, shaking the entire economy and leading to potential inflation. Strict censorship of postal and telegraphic news is also causing suspicion between Syrians and French soldiers. Syrian Governor-General General Mittelhauser has not crossed into Palestine to join the British, but has been recalled by the Vichy government. With Mr. Mittelhauser gone, his deputy resigned and flew to Egypt to join the British forces. French soldiers are now receiving news from home that their families are suffering hardship under German control, which is increasing their resentment and dissatisfaction with the Pétain government.

### German-Turkish Relations

Istanbul – After Turkish Prime Minister Saydam's speech on July 12, frankly rejecting foreign interference, and the subsequent departure of German Ambassador to Turkey, Von Papen, for Berlin, German efforts to win over Turkey are proceeding along a new path. German agents here are no longer threatening the political world, but are instead focusing on gaining the trust of Turkish merchants. They argue that Turkey's true interests lie in developing trade with Germany, using the recently signed Turkish-German trade agreement as justification. Circulars discussing this argument have recently been issued, and some Turkish newspapers are concerned that this development may lead to German control of Turkish trade. (Reuters, 31st)

The court will have jurisdiction over crimes committed within the past ten years before the promulgation of this law. In addition, the Cabinet has issued a substitute legal order, allowing any case, even those already being tried by other judicial organs, to be transferred to the Supreme Court for trial. Defendants will not be allowed to appeal the court's decisions. (Havas, 30th)

### German Forces Hesitate to Attack England, War Situation Gradually Favorable to England, Naval and Air Superiority are Decisive Factors, Large Army Massed on the Islands, Defenses Strong

London – A military correspondent for the "Yorkshire Post" today summarized the factors currently favoring the British side in the war as follows: (1) The German forces failed to follow up the evacuation of British forces in France in June and attack England, thus missing an opportunity. (2) Britain now has a large army massed domestically and its defenses are strong. (3) The British Air Force has created a spiritual advantage. (4) The British blockade is now gradually closing the last supply routes. (5) The enemy has failed to prevent supplies from the British Empire and the Americas. (6) Britain now has more food and raw materials than before, and the sea is cleared by the British fleet. (7) German forces are distributed along the coastline from the Arctic Ocean to the Pyrenees. (8) The German coastline does not have sufficient ships to protect it and prevent invasion. (9) Italy's position increases Germany's burden, as Germany would have to provide material assistance if Britain attacked Italy. (10) Britain controls the Mediterranean, preventing Italy from communicating with its colonies. (11) Britain is confident of repelling air attacks, and the number of British fighters is increasing daily. (12) Britain has established an offensive advantage with its bomber force. (13) The country is resolute and united, while Hitler has concerns about his occupied territories and the Balkans. (14) The Soviet Union is now hindering Germany's freedom of action. (Reuters, 31st)

New York – The "New York Times" today wrote that when France fell, everyone thought the blitzkrieg would soon be unleashed on Britain. Unexpectedly, the British showed amazing calm and courage, thinking through everything they saw across the Channel and preparing to deal with an attack on their island. If German forces were to land in Britain tomorrow, no village would be shocked or panicked. However, it is highly possible that Hitler will never dare to risk his expeditionary force to a certain degree of destruction. The warlord who dictated the French armistice terms in the same place where Germany surrendered in 1918 may have the same sense of humor and revenge, intending to conquer Britain through starvation. If he thinks this way and tries to impose a blockade before attacking, it would be good news for the British, as this is the type of war they would choose first, and can use all their strongest weapons to the extreme. (Reuters, 31st)

### Germany May Use Airplanes to Release Liquid Gas, British Government Warns Public to Take Precautions

London – It was announced here last night that Britain will double the blockade of German imports and exports. The announcement stated that all imports and exports must obtain a "Naval Ministry Permit." Germany's occupation of the French coastline has greatly changed the economic war. "We should not only control all shipping in the Mediterranean and the North Sea, but also that passing through the Atlantic," British authorities expressed confidence that the tightening of the blockade will reduce the patrolling responsibilities of the British Navy, as the number of ships passing through the Atlantic may decrease. The Atlantic islands included in the tightening of the blockade are reportedly Cape Verde, the Azores, and the Canary Islands. The British government has notified Washington and Latin American countries of Britain's determination to tighten control over contraband trade. (United Press, 31st)

### British Government Announces Intensified Economic Blockade Against Germany, Atlantic Shipping Will Be Under Strict Naval Control, and Plans to Completely Stop Oil Shipments to Spain, Germany May Use Airplanes to Release Liquid Gas, British Government Warns Public to Take Precautions

London – Minister of Economic Warfare Dalton stated in the House of Commons yesterday that although Germany has occupied most of Western Europe, its required overseas imports are still blocked in the sea controlled by the British Navy. Some quarters have suggested that Britain is imposing the blockade on some neutral countries, but this is not the case. In addition to issuing naval certificates, the British government still adheres to the policy of not only allowing sufficient supplies to meet the needs of various countries to pass through British naval jurisdiction, but also assisting neutral countries in obtaining supplies. Shipping Minister Cross replied to a Member of Parliament's question, saying that the progress of the war makes new plans for controlling shipping necessary. The number of ships under British control is very large, including neutral ships chartered by Britain. The government is still prepared to charter more ships, but also intends to adopt other methods to ensure that ships not under British control cannot engage in trade beneficial to the enemy. The conveniences enjoyed by ships under British control have always applied to all ships, but from now on, shipowners who have provided sufficient remuneration to Britain or who assure the government that their business does not harm Britain's war effort will be able to obtain a pass and continue to enjoy this convenience; otherwise, they will not. Those who do not carry this pass will be subject to individual investigation and will face delays and inconvenience. (Reuters, 31st)

### Canada Large-Scale Production of Military Supplies, Can Manufacture 100 Airplanes Per Month, Unmarried Men Forced to Undergo Military Training

Ottawa – Minister of Munitions and Supply Howe stated in the House of Commons the situation of Canada's industrial mobilization, stating that almost all sectors of the world have large-scale production of "automatic equipment" as Canada currently does. Currently, about 600 pairs are produced daily, and this number will definitely increase greatly in January and February. Canadian aircraft factories built 25 aircraft last week, and in the early part of next year monthly aircraft production can reach 360 aircraft. The production of various guns and ammunition and explosives is also increasing. The Minister of National Defence also stated in the House of Commons that all unmarried men in Canada who pass inspection, from the age of 21 to 45, will be forced to undergo 30 days of military training within one year. There is no reason why Canada should not adopt this system, training a million-strong army on the one hand, and still engage in industrial production on the other, to meet the army's needs. In the first year, only unmarried men aged 21 to 35 will be called up, which will roughly meet the needs of the national defense sector. It is estimated that there are a total of 2.5 million Canadian men between the ages of 18 and 44, of whom 1.198 million are unmarried. (Reuters, 31st)

On the 29th, a British convoy was spotted, including several battleships, one aircraft carrier, multiple destroyers, and several transport ships. Italian aircraft immediately intercepted and bombed, and the enemy ships opened fire. The ships quickly scattered, and the fighters on the aircraft carrier took off to intercept the Italian aircraft, but the Italian aircraft had already gained a favorable position and dropped several heavy bombs. One enemy ship caught fire, and one enemy aircraft was shot down. Two battleships and one aircraft carrier were also hit at the same time. (Haitong Agency, 31st)

### British and Germans Publish Air Force Battle Situation, Due to Poor Weather the Previous Day, Both Sides Had Little Activity

The remaining aircraft attacked targets such as oil refineries, shipyards, airfields, and transportation targets in the Ruhr region of northwestern Germany, and in the Netherlands and Belgium. On Sunday, there were encounters around the British coast, and a total of 21 enemy aircraft were destroyed, and two British fighters went missing. (Reuters, 31st)

Berlin – Yesterday's German military report stated, "Yesterday, the German Air Force attacked the port of Dover, using several waves of Junkers dive bombers to bomb the facilities in the port. The damage it suffered will make it ineffective for a long time. Although the British side put up fierce resistance with anti-aircraft guns and a large number of fighters, the bombs dropped by the German aircraft hit their targets. Four ships in the port, totaling 32,000 tons, were also hit. One German aircraft collided with a British aircraft, but still returned to its base after dropping its bombs, and no one was injured. This time, the British lost 15 Spitfires and Hurricanes, while the German side lost only three aircraft. The numbers published by the British government are only intended to cover up their failure. However, the British side admits that the German attack on Dover completely bombed military objectives." (Haitong Agency, 31st)

### Tagore Encourages Compatriots Not to Be Used by Others

London – General de Gaulle, head of the French National Committee in London, stated last night during a French broadcast on the British Broadcasting Corporation that the first result of the Pétain government's acceptance of armistice terms was dissatisfaction among the natives of the French Empire, which may lead to rebellion. Their loyalty and trust in France was shaken by the French Empire's surrender without a fight, and they all felt angry. General de Gaulle concluded that those who were compromising in Vichy were obviously despicable tools voluntarily used by the enemy, so he declared in the name of France that the French Empire must not obey their evil orders.

### Random Snippets of Roosevelt's Busy Life

For the past seven years, U.S. President Roosevelt has shouldered the world's most significant responsibilities, yet he manages to exude competence and joy, possessing a hearty appetite and sleeping like a baby. His most remarkable trait is a profound interest in life, enabling him to find "endless joy" in his demanding duties. Had it been someone else, they might have long since "retreated." Recently, both domestic and foreign troubles have pressed in, leaving President Roosevelt with even fewer opportunities for rest as he dedicates himself day and night to public service. He has spent years in the White House, navigating numerous urgent and difficult situations with unwavering commitment. During the Wabash River flood, his study remained illuminated until two in the morning; maps and reports were strewn across his desk, surrounded by secretaries and military personnel, as he issued instructions to western governors via long-distance telephone. After the outbreak of war in Europe, Secretary of State Hull and Under Secretary Welles often remained in his bedroom until dawn. Roosevelt possesses the spirit of a firefighter, responding instantly to any alarm. Only around mid-September last year, when the European war had just erupted, did the president, usually so cheerful and energetic, suddenly fall ill, suffering from a severe liver ailment. As soon as Congress passed his Neutrality Act, he rushed to Warm Springs to rest and restore his weary nerves. Now, Roosevelt has gained extraordinary confidence, admired by his supporters and feared by his detractors.

President Roosevelt's workday begins between 8:30 and 9:00 AM, starting with a leisurely breakfast in bed. Secretaries, trusted advisors, and occasionally a cabinet member are already in attendance. After breakfast, he dresses and is wheeled in his wheelchair to his desk in the office. Meetings with cabinet members and visitors take place from 10:00 or 10:30 AM until 5:00 or 5:30 PM. He eats a light lunch during this time, often discussing important matters with senior officials at the table. Sometimes, he invites the last visitor he met to join him for a swim in the pool, which he had built after moving into the White House. Usually, swimming is followed by a massage. If there are other engagements in the evening, he confers on national affairs in his study. Otherwise, he reads casually or enjoys his stamp collection. If there is a formal banquet, he retreats to his private room alone after greeting the last arriving guest, leaving his wife to entertain the assembled guests.

His personal physician, Dr. McIntire, pays close attention to the President's health, but Roosevelt is very self-disciplined. He has a good appetite, yet his weight consistently remains between 182 and 187 pounds, fluctuating by no more than five pounds. He enjoys game and fish, especially turtle, although it is not easily digested. Sometimes, he drinks a "cocktail" before dinner. Informal meals are often held in his study. He often asks his guests, "What would you like to drink?" If "cocktails" have already been served, no further alcohol is consumed after the meal. Dr. McIntire insists that the President take a trip after a period of intense work to change the environment. During his rest and travel, Roosevelt usually manages to completely disconnect, savoring the pleasure of secluded leisure, except for half an hour spent listening to official reports from the White House. As a seasoned naval expert, he often takes the opportunity during his travels to engage in command during exercises. Upon returning from his travels, the first thing he does is meet with reporters, flashing a tanned smile, a cigarette in hand, full of energy and exuding charm. Clearly, he finds great enjoyment in his role as president. He wields great power, which is both stimulating and mysterious, and he possesses a childlike innocence and delight.

He has the talent of a stage performer, never approaching the podium like an ordinary person, but rather like a star entering the stage, appearing suddenly from above at the peak of the audience's excitement. When he speaks, he builds tension when tension is needed, pauses when pauses are needed, and he perfectly captures the moment when the audience responds with applause. The ideas, phrases, punchlines, and even the prepared speeches themselves are all carefully scrutinized by his top advisors, so any final statement has been reviewed by four or five people in addition to his own considerations. Even in these difficult times, his sense of humor, including irony and jokes, has not diminished. He also dislikes being bound by convention, often receiving foreign guests in casual attire, replacing stale clichés with witty and insightful remarks.

Mrs. Roosevelt, Eleanor, is a first-rate mother and wife, irreplaceable. Mrs. Roosevelt's reputation and status almost rival her husband's. If the First Lady were less active, life in the White House for Roosevelt might be quieter, but it would also likely lack in compassion, empathy, and generosity. His staff sometimes protests about the "disruptive" guests who come "through the back door," but they thank Mrs. Roosevelt, as it is her benevolent policy. Mrs. Roosevelt's friends often bring "grassroots" news to broaden the President's horizons. As a couple, they are truly the Meng and Liang of our time. Naturally, both of them are incredibly busy in the White House, so it is common for Mrs. Roosevelt to have a casual conversation with her husband in the evening study or after the President has finished his official duties. Regarding family matters, he expressed great regret over the recent divorce of his eldest son, James.

In the small organization that works with him in the White House, one person who deserves special mention is Miss Marguerite LeHand, who has been his secretary for twenty years. Tall and beautiful, impeccably dressed, quiet, and virtuous, she is truly a model of efficiency. All the President's personal correspondence and affairs are entrusted to her. This "Missy" has her own living room, bedroom, and bathroom in the White House. Urgent phone calls from across the Atlantic at night from Ambassador Bullitt in France or Ambassador Kennedy in England first have to go through "Missy," and if she says "go ahead," the phone next to the President's bed will ring loudly. President Roosevelt treats his friends with great kindness. In addition to his family, friends, and colleagues, he welcomes a wide range of people, embodying the American spirit. From the nobility to the commoner, if he has the opportunity to meet them, he always finds a way to handle it well.

Patience and charm are Roosevelt's weapons when dealing with people. Often, people arrive disgruntled but leave satisfied. And some, after seeing him, can't help but say, "Isn't he charming?" as if they have discovered something rare. In this eventful year of 1940, the "man" sitting in the White House remains calm. He takes a casual view of economic concerns that many previous presidents considered daunting. He has lived comfortably on his private income since he was born. He is neither extravagant nor stingy in the White House. Some people who pay attention to these kinds of things say that his annual travel and entertainment expenses are only $25,000, which could not possibly cover the costs. Inviting royalty costs a lot of money. Even if you combine his private income and salary, it is still not enough, but he has plenty of savings to draw on, so he doesn't worry. He is very self-aware. If he were to retire and become an ordinary citizen, he could make a living as an editor or writer. Besides, his wife's ability to earn money is already unique.

People close to President Roosevelt say that he has two theories about life. One is that he is optimistic and fearless, and he does everything he can to make things that benefit humanity succeed. When he takes on a task, he always finds a way to solve it. Because he is straightforward and somewhat impatient, he immediately wants to find a solution to any problem he encounters. He is dedicated to saving the world and calling for peace, shouting himself hoarse and doing everything he can... He only seeks peace of mind and asks nothing more. He has complete faith in his own judgment. The other theory is more complex. Deep down, he is scarred and may well be a sad person. Nevertheless, he bravely takes heart, embraces joy, embodies Heaven's virtue of cherishing life, and performs all kinds of "good deeds." President Roosevelt is at the pinnacle of human achievement, yet he is humble and open-minded. His greatness comes from this. Using any single theory to explain such an outstanding person is too simplistic and insufficient. Ultimately, whether all his measures are beneficial or detrimental to the country will be determined by history.

### Report from the Sichuan Education Commissioner: Progress in Preparing for National Education (Part 2) – Teacher Training Plans

The number of teachers needed for the implementation of national education in the province has increased dramatically compared to before. If the existing teachers in each county continue to operate the existing schools, then with each year's increase in primary school classes, calculating 1.5 teachers per class, we will still need to add 30,000 teachers. For the teachers needed this year, apart from this year's normal school graduates and graduates from other secondary schools who can serve as teachers, and the deployment of service corps members, there is still a shortage of 17,000 to 20,000 teachers. To address the shortage of teachers, it has been stipulated that each county will hold teacher training classes, recruiting private school teachers or students who have attended junior high school and other intellectuals to join the classes for training. The training period is two months during the summer vacation and one month during the winter vacation. After the two-month training period during the summer vacation, they will be assigned to serve as teachers in various national schools, and then recalled for training during the winter vacation. The training subjects include spiritual training, an overview of national education, administration of central schools and national schools, an outline of local autonomy, teaching methods for national language textbooks, teaching methods for general knowledge textbooks, teaching methods for arithmetic textbooks, teaching methods for music, physical education, and scout textbooks, teaching methods for crafts and art textbooks, implementation methods for civic education, general teaching techniques, practice, physical education, music, and military training. The required funds are all allocated by the province, and the teaching materials for each subject are also compiled and distributed by the Department of Education for application. These training classes have already been launched separately. As for the teachers needed by August next year, measures for one-year teacher training classes have been stipulated, ordering them to be handled by each commissioner's office. The admission qualifications are junior high school graduation and equivalent education or having served as a primary school teacher for more than three years. The study period is set at one year, and the study subjects are handled according to the simplified normal school curriculum issued by the Ministry. Graduates will be used for the newly established national schools next year. To adapt to the needs of the facts, the commissioners of each district and the governments of each county are planning to merge the teacher training classes with the village chief training classes, and they are planning to change the study period of the one-year teacher training classes to half a year, and they are submitting separate applications for approval.

Preparation for National Education in Each District and County

Since the province decided to implement national education, the commissioners of each district and the county chiefs of each county have started preparing for the implementation of national education. After the promulgation of the implementation measures, each district and county made further plans. As of the end of June, each district and county has made the following preparations for the implementation of national education: (1) Planning for the establishment of schools. Each district and county has made detailed plans for the establishment of schools in stages. According to the reports of each district and county, it will not be difficult to complete the universal establishment of national schools in three years, and the 1st District, 3rd District, 7th District, 10th District, and 11th District are planning to complete the establishment of national schools universally within one year. (2) Fundraising. Each district and county has made preparations for fundraising. The 1st District, 3rd District, 7th District, 10th District, and 11th District are planning to build houses and schools and raise enough funds for national schools to lay a permanent foundation for the nation. (3) Improving teacher salaries. Each district and county, in view of the fact that the current salaries of general teachers are too low to maintain their livelihood, want to ensure that the original teachers can work with peace of mind, and those who are preparing to serve as teachers are happy to teach, it is necessary to improve teacher salaries. Therefore, they are working hard to improve teacher salaries in accordance with the provincial measures. At present, the salaries of general teachers in each county have been raised to more than 30 yuan, and the 1st District, 3rd District, 7th District, 10th District, and 11th District have provisions for providing meals and subsidies for rice for the sake of giving preferential treatment to teachers. This system should be vigorously promoted so that it can be popularized throughout the province. (4) Adjusting administrative organizations. Each county has uniformly established an education section, and the personnel of the education section have been adjusted. The number of school inspectors in each county has also been increased as appropriate to meet the needs of promoting national education. Since each district and county has made such preparations for promoting national education, it will be more convenient when it is actually implemented.

Organization of the National Education Committee

At present, the province is promoting compulsory education and mass education, and has separately organized a compulsory education committee and a mass education committee to be responsible for planning, promoting, and evaluating. To implement the new national education system, compulsory education and mass education have been merged, and there is no need to establish the compulsory education committee and the mass education committee separately. Therefore, the compulsory education committee and the mass education committee have been merged and reorganized into a national education committee. The interim regulations for the organization of the Sichuan Provincial National Education Committee have been drafted and submitted to the 401st committee meeting of the provincial government for approval. The National Education Committee is chaired by the Director of the Department of Education and has 15 to 20 members. The candidates for the committee members are as follows: (1) Two members of the Sichuan Provincial Party Department; (2) Two senators of the Sichuan Provincial Provisional Senate; (3) The Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, the Chief Secretary, and the Head of the Third Section; (4) The Chief Secretary of the Department of Education and the Heads of the First, Second, and Third Sections, and the Director of the School Inspectorate; (5) Five to eleven education experts or people enthusiastic about education. Under the Director of the Committee, there are five standing committee members, one secretary, one chief officer, and seven to nine officers, who are responsible for various committee affairs. The preparations for national education in the province have been briefly described above. In the future, how to plan the national education undertaking and make the methods more perfect, and how to supervise and guide to improve the efficiency, we sincerely hope that the members of the National Education Committee and the education personnel of the whole province will give assistance and guidance at any time. We are fortunate, we are fortunate! (End)

### Ministry of Education Establishes Guizhou College of Agriculture and Engineering

(Chongqing Aviation News) The Ministry of Education believes that agriculture and industry in Guizhou urgently need to be developed. However, Guizhou is located in a remote area, and there is still a lack of higher agricultural and industrial academic institutions. This not only affects the War of Resistance, but also poses difficulties for Guizhou high school students in terms of further education. When Minister Chen of the Ministry of Education inspected the southwest and passed through Guiyang, he expressed his intention to establish a college of agriculture and engineering in Guizhou to meet the current needs. After returning to Chongqing, he immediately started planning. It has now been drafted and submitted to the Central Government to set up the National Guizhou College of Agriculture and Engineering. It has been formally approved by the 469th meeting of the Executive Yuan.

In addition, the Ministry of Education specially requested that the private Xiangya College be changed to a national one, which was also approved by the Executive Yuan.

### Recent Developments at the College of Arts and Sciences of the University of Nanking

(Chengdu Correspondence) Since the College of Arts and Sciences of the University of Nanking moved to Chengdu, although it has not been able to develop to the fullest extent due to the limited school site, it has continued to work hard. The main points are to maintain academic studies, add necessary subjects, and intensify research. Research is intended to enhance teaching interest and increase teaching effectiveness. The content includes: (1) Compilation of historical materials of the Sino-Japanese War since 1937; (2) Exploration of border issues; (3) Analysis of county administration issues; (4) Experimentation of woolen fabrics; (5) Investigation and improvement of Sichuan handicrafts; (6) Compilation of a catalog of educational slides, etc. Each department of Chinese and English also has a central goal and is engaged in research and writing, which is very helpful for reference. In view of the lack of libraries and vocational schools in China, and the fact that libraries in various places are not well managed and inefficient due to the lack of specialized personnel, the College of Arts and Sciences of the University of Nanking plans to establish a library training program, the purpose of which is to train library professionals and assist in the improvement of library undertakings in various places. It is reported that it has been formally approved by the Ministry of Education before the summer vacation this year and will recruit new students in the summer vacation together with the newly established Department of Philosophy and Psychology.

### A Hurricane Suddenly Advances Rapidly: Shanghai Swept Last Night; Tides Stirred by the Wind; Streets Flooded

This hurricane progressed very rapidly. At 10:00 AM yesterday, the Jianghai Customs received a report from the observatory that the hurricane had reached 27.30 degrees north latitude and 125 degrees east longitude, with the eye of the storm at 60 nautical miles, advancing rapidly northwest, and likely to strike Shanghai. The Customs then, at 10:50 AM yesterday, hoisted one black ball on the flagpole atop the clock tower to predict the hurricane's arrival and warn ships in the Huangpu River to take precautions. At 4:25 PM, the Customs received another report from the observatory that the hurricane was nearing Shanghai, located at 28.30 degrees north latitude and 124 degrees east longitude, the eye of the storm remained at 60 nautical miles, and still rapidly advancing northwest, having reached the Tongsha sea area outside the Wusongkou. The Customs immediately added another black ball. Therefore, since mid-afternoon yesterday, two black balls were hoisted high on the flagpole of the Customs clock tower. At night, this was changed to two red lanterns.

Signal Identification

It is heard that if the wind force does not subside this morning, the signal will follow the Port Authority Notice No. 7 by Mr. Tebeck of the Customs on the 24th of this month, and starting today (August 1st), a black cross will be hoisted, with subsequent signals remaining one black ball, and one red lantern at night, or two red lanterns in emergencies. Since the Customs hoisted two black balls yesterday, the situation on the Huangpu River immediately became tense. All incoming ships increased their speed to dock as early as possible, and departing ships ceased raising anchors.

Ships Sheltering from the Wind

Yesterday, the Tai Koo Company's Qingyuan wheel bound for Hong Kong and Haiphong, left port at 10:00 AM, but after receiving the hurricane report, anchored at Wusongkou to shelter from the wind. The Chongqing wheel, which left port at 11:00 AM yesterday morning bound for Qinhuangdao, also anchored at Wusongkou. The Haikou wheel, originally scheduled to raise anchor yesterday afternoon bound for Hong Kong, ceased its departure to avoid the wind. Jardine Matheson's Guisheng wheel, scheduled to go to Hong Kong and Haiphong yesterday, and the Yongsheng wheel, also scheduled to go to Tianjin yesterday, both ceased their voyages and will depart after the hurricane passes. In addition, the Greek wheel Hellenie Trader, which arrived the day before yesterday from Saigon with a large amount of foreign rice, totaling more than 24,700 bags, and was originally scheduled to depart for Qingdao after unloading yesterday, also ceased its departure due to the hurricane.

Passing Shanghai This Morning

As for Jardine Matheson's Yusheng wheel, which came to Shanghai from Haiphong via Hong Kong, it is heard that Mr. Chaplim, the Director of the Municipal Postal Administration, also returned to Shanghai on that wheel. It was originally scheduled to arrive in port today, but due to the sudden hurricane, the arrival of that wheel is likely to be delayed. According to the Datong News Agency reporter, the hurricane center will generally pass Shanghai this morning, and if it does not make landfall, it will move towards the Yellow Sea. Although the Huangpu River was only slightly flooded yesterday, the tides had been stirred by wind and rain, and water had accumulated on all roads.

### Strike at the Water and Electricity Company: Still in Stalemate; Labor Awaits Mediation from the Municipal Council

The labor strike at the British-owned Water and Electricity Company, since Mr. Yu Qiaqing once met with Mr. Caradoli, the chairman of the company, has been stuck because the company's proposed return-to-work conditions for employees were deemed unacceptable by the labor side, and the attitudes of both sides remain very firm, making it impossible to reach an agreement. According to a reporter from the Pingming News Agency, the company's staff side convened representatives of the new and old factory workers yesterday to discuss countermeasures. As a result of the discussion, they decided to wait for mediation from the Municipal Council. It is heard that the workers at the new factory will settle their July salaries with the company today.

### No Progress on "Special Police" in West Shanghai; The Bureau Will Not Take Action Until the Police Commissioner Returns to Shanghai

The North-China Daily News stated that an official from the Municipal Council stated yesterday (30th) that regarding the joint management of the police affairs of the extraterritorial roads by the Municipal Council and the authorities outside the Settlement, no concrete action will be taken by the Bureau until Major Bowan, the Police Commissioner of the Municipal Council, returns to Shanghai from his vacation in Weihaiwei. It is expected that Major Bowan will not return to Shanghai until the end of August. It is noted that Fu Xiaoan has already responded to the proposal made by the Municipal Council regarding the issue of extraterritorial roads. It is heard that Mr. Philippe, the Secretary-General and Director-General of the Municipal Council, is currently studying Fu's reply, which is written in Chinese and totals thirty pages. After recently receiving the land bureau files handed over by the Municipal Council, Fu has expressed his willingness to resolve the police affairs cases of the extraterritorial roads with the Municipal Council as soon as possible.

### Japanese Inspection of Mail in the French Concession Has Become a Reality; Seven Japanese Inspectors Begin Work

Under the urgent circumstances, the Japanese inspection of mail at the Rue Massenet postal branch has already begun with the Japanese personnel moving into the postal bureau the day before yesterday. Yesterday morning at eight o'clock, three Japanese inspectors continued to work at the bureau. The details are as follows:

Head Office Order

According to a reporter from Datong News Agency, the Shanghai Postal Administration has secretly ordered the Rue Massenet post office to handle the inspection of mail at that bureau in accordance with the regulations for inspecting the Postal Administration mail of the 27th year. The Rue Massenet branch has prepared an inspection log, and after the inspectors inspect and impound the mail, they will sign in the logbook, so that the bureau will not be held responsible.

Beginning to Read

After the seven Japanese inspectors gathered at the post office at 8:00 AM the day before yesterday and completed the formality of moving in, at 8:00 AM yesterday morning, three of the seven inspectors continued to be stationed in the messenger room to read letters. Each of these inspectors wore a circular metal badge on their chest and were proficient in Chinese, English, and Japanese. According to one of them, they have been responsible for inspecting mail at post offices in the Northeast.

Cancellation of Delivery

Also, according to a reporter from Datong News Agency who consulted with Mr. Wang Weisheng, Assistant of the Shanghai Postal Administration, the bureau is studying the possibility of having the mail collected and sent by the Rue Massenet post office delivered by the Administration. In this case, the mail delivered to the area under the jurisdiction of that bureau will be delayed by half a day. It is necessary to consider whether this can be understood by the senders or receivers.

Acting Alone

Mr. Wang finally said that he could guarantee that the inspection of the mail at the Rue Massenet post office had not yet begun, and that the implementation of this matter was already imminent. However, Mr. Wang then said that the Postal Administration would not notify the Rue Massenet post office when the inspection of mail at that bureau began, because the inspection of mail was a separate action by the Japanese and was not within the scope of postal services.

Office Space

The Rue Massenet post office has prepared a location for the inspectors behind the packaging bags, planning to enclose two rooms, and the craftsmen have already measured the area, but the fence has not yet been built. Before that room is completed, the Japanese inspectors are obviously using the messenger room as a temporary office. Judging from the situation in the past two days, various letters have begun to be affected, but there have been no cases of detention yet. It is also learned that Mr. Chaplim, the Shanghai Postmaster, is coming to Shanghai from Hong Kong on the Yusheng wheel and is expected to arrive tomorrow.

The Director Has Not Resigned

Also, according to Mr. Wang Weisheng, Deputy Postmaster of the Postal Administration, the news that Postmaster Chaplim will resign is a rumor. Mr. Chaplim is currently in charge of a Maritime Administration post office and will definitely not resign in the near future.

### Shaoxing Prefecture Relief Fair to Open This Afternoon; Invited Yu Qiaqing and Others to Unveil; Huang Yuqi Talks About Fundraising

Yesterday, Mr. Huang Yuzhai, Director of General Affairs of the Shaoxing Prefecture Relief Fundraising Committee, told a reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency that the food shortage in the seven counties of Shaoxing Prefecture has lasted for months and has not yet been resolved. It still relies on the generous donations of fellow villagers in Shanghai. The committee's progress with the assistance of various industries in Shanghai is still quite smooth. The donations from the silver and money industries in the city are very enthusiastic, and the coal industry has promised to help. The fundraising methods are divided into red and white forms. Anyone who pledges to donate will post the name of their business on red paper, and those who do not intend to donate will post it on white paper, and then these red and white papers will be posted in the market of each industry, so that people in the same industry can compare with each other. This method is very good. At the same time, it can also be seen their enthusiasm for raising funds for disaster relief. In order to further raise funds, the committee has agreed with all the famous dramatists in Shanghai to perform for fundraising starting today. It is hoped that enthusiastic people from all walks of life will provide more assistance.

Entertainment to Help Relief

In order to expand fundraising for Shaoxing Prefecture relief, the committee will hold a theatrical performance from today to the 4th at the Carlton Theatre on 21 Park Road to raise funds for disaster relief.

The Continental News stated that Mr. Alcott, a well-known American radio news broadcaster in the city, received a threat yesterday (30th) that he must stop broadcasting in three days. It started when Mr. Alcott was broadcasting on XMHA radio at 11:20 PM on the 29th, when someone suddenly called the radio station and made the above threat. After the reporter answered the phone, he told Mr. Alcott. The caller refused to disclose his name, but it was heard that he was a foreigner. The reporter asked him why he did not tell Mr. Alcott himself. The caller said that he might do so. At 1:30 PM yesterday afternoon, Mr. Alcott received a phone call at his residence. The caller was obviously the person who made the threatening phone call yesterday, and ordered Mr. Alcott to stop broadcasting in three days.

### Foreign Wheat Arrives in a Surge, Flour is Plentiful; Stop Selling at Fair Prices

The noodle industry in the city previously requested the Municipal Council to ask the Fuxin and Fufeng flour mills to supply fair-priced flour again due to the shortage of flour on the market and the difficulty in purchasing it. Now that a large amount of foreign wheat has arrived, hoarders have emerged one after another, and sales are sluggish. The shortage of flour on the market has become a thing of the past. Therefore, the factory prices are more expensive than the market price. For this reason, the noodle shops voluntarily requested to stop, so the flour mills stopped selling at fair prices from the 29th. In total, 3,498 bags were sold at fair prices in 22 days. The Noodle Industry Association announced that the fair price sale has ended. In order to facilitate the industry and purchase fair-priced flour when there is a shortage in the future, they specially notified all members yesterday to apply for registration so that they can be supplied in the same way during the fair price sale.

### Greek Merchant Ship Arrives with Tribute Rice; Police Escort Protection into the Warehouse; A Total of 25,000 Bags, Said to Be Purchased by Chinese; Japanese Merchants Lease Ships to Carry, Japanese Side Arrives to Record

The English Great America Evening News stated that this morning (31st), the "Greek Merchant" wheel arrived at the Bund Beijing Road Pier with 25,000 bags of Saigon rice. After unloading, it was transported by truck to the Bank of China warehouse on North Suzhou Road. The rice-carrying vehicles were all protected by the police, but the patrolmen did not sit next to the driver, but climbed to the top of the rice-carrying vehicles to ensure safety along the way. In addition, Chinese and Western patrolmen were stationed near the unloading pier to prevent disturbances.

Japanese Side Arrives

Not long after the rice began to be loaded onto the vehicles, about seven Japanese people in semi-uniforms arrived at the venue to record the amount of rice. It is believed that these Japanese people belong to the Japanese Army Special Service Department. It is said that for the past few months, the Japanese Army Special Service Department has sent personnel to monitor cargo transportation and shipping in the Bund area. Since the Shanghai War in 1937, the 25,000 bags that arrived this morning are the largest batch of rice shipped to Shanghai. It is said that it was purchased by Chinese and transported by a Greek merchant ship leased by the Japanese. After being unloaded, it was entrusted to the American Ruifeng Transportation Company for transportation to the warehouse. According to people from Ruifeng Company, each vehicle must travel back and forth 250 times to transport the rice from the unloading site to the warehouse, and it will be able to be completely transported tomorrow (1st).

Rice Prices Rise Again

After a large amount of foreign rice was transported to Shanghai, rice prices had fallen by more than 10 yuan in a row. However, since this week, speculators have used old tricks to hoard and manipulate prices, and prices have soared again. Yesterday, the prices of various foreign rice varieties rose by 2 to 3.5 yuan. In total, the prices of various foreign rice varieties have risen by 5 to 6 yuan in three days. The new procedures for requesting mediation stipulated by the Rice Market Management Committee are: (1) Prepare a formal letter with a seal, (2) Attach a transaction order, (3) Limited to formal transactions, (4) If mediation fails three times, please cancel the General Assembly.

### Bomb Case on Avenue Foch Continues to Uncover Military Supplies; Wang, the Tenant, Never Returns; Phone Call to the Aubert House Detective Office

The French Concession patrolmen searched No. 80, Lane 100, Avenue Foch, and discovered that a hand grenade exploded, killing a Russian detective, Ivanoff, and injuring a translator. This was reported in yesterday's newspaper. Now, according to the reporter from the Pingming News Agency, the details are as follows:

Tenant Missing

The house was originally rented by Tang Zhuan (28 years old) from Guangdong. The third floor was sublet to a Wang about half a year ago. He rarely interacted with people, so the tenants in the building did not pay much attention to Wang's actions, nor did they know what profession he was engaged in. Before the incident occurred, Wang left and never returned, and his whereabouts are unknown. The patrol room is still conducting a thorough investigation of the case.

Continued Discovery of Military Supplies

At about 1:00 PM the day before yesterday, the French patrol room received a phone call from the Aubert House stating that a large number of military supplies were stored on the third floor of No. 80, directly opposite its Avenue Foch residence. The French patrol room, upon receiving the report, sent Inspector Berger, Russian detective Ivanoff, and a Chinese translator to investigate, which caused the disaster. At that time, in addition to the death of Ivanoff, shrapnel penetrated the second floor and injured another tenant, Yan Tan (61 years old). After the incident, the patrol room continued to send detectives to investigate, and seized six pistols in the room. (According to the Society News Agency, two more hand grenades were seized.)

### American Soldiers Whose Term of Service Has Expired Return Home on the Chaumont; Departure Date Set for the 6th of This Month; The Chaumont's Last Voyage to the Far East

The English Great America Evening News stated that approximately 150 US Navy Fourth Marine Regiment soldiers whose 30-month term of service in the Far East is about to expire will leave Shanghai for the United States on the US Navy transport wheel Chaumont on August 6th. In addition, many US Asian Fleet sailors who have served in the East

will also return to the United States from Shanghai on the Chaumont. The Chaumont will arrive in Shanghai on August 4th, and was originally scheduled to stay for at least one week before crossing the Pacific Ocean and returning to the United States via Manira, Guam, and Honolulu. But suddenly the order was changed, and August 6th was set as the

Departure Date

The dependents of the Marine Corps soldiers and sailors will accompany the wheel. According to the US Navy Department, the Chaumont was transferred out of the Pacific at the beginning of this year, but the plan was changed again, and the wheel was sent back to the East once. Therefore, the wheel has been sailing to the East for 20 years, and this trip may be the last time it comes to the Far East. However, the current

world situation is unsettled, so it is impossible to predict the future voyage of the warship. In the future, the US Navy transport wheel that will sail to Shanghai may be the Wharton, which has a tonnage of 10,000 tons. The wheel was purchased by the US Navy Department from a merchant wheel company last year, and took the name of an early

US Marine Corps

commander. The Wharton is expected to cross the Pacific Ocean to Shanghai for the first time in mid-September. In addition, the US wheel Gold Star stationed on Guam sailed from the island via Yokohama and arrived in Shanghai last night (30th), and will stay for a few days before returning south to Guam, except in case of emergency. The North-China Daily News stated that the Municipal Council will not convene board meetings during the summer vacation from July 25 to May 3, unless to discuss emergency matters. However, Municipal Council staff will continue to work as usual.

### "Central China Company" Established by Japan, "Liuhang Receiving Station" Setup: Chinese and Foreign Circles Still Use Foreign Utilities to Avoid Inspection

Since the start of the war of aggression against China by Japan, the industry, commerce, and transportation facilities in all areas where the Chinese army retreated have been illegally seized. Although the Japanese side has pretended to return factories in the occupied areas, this has not yet been realized. During the outbreak of the Shanghai war, public utilities such as the Ministry of Communications Radio Station and the Ministry of Communications Shanghai Telephone Bureau, the Zhabei and Public Works Bureau public bus companies, and utility companies were all under Japanese control following the military shift. The Japanese side then established the "Central China Company" to forcibly seize all of them and engage in restoration. Now, they intend to control the telecommunications industry, so they restored the "Zhenru Radio Transmitting Station" last year. Now, they have established the "Liuhang Radio Receiving Station" yesterday to control our original domestic and foreign telegrams and international telephone services. However, this kind of business is purely to facilitate their military operations. Chinese and foreign circles and various industries, in order to avoid illegal inspections of communication and information, are still happy to use the utilities of companies like Great Northern, Great Eastern, and Pacific.

### Electrical Engineer Wang Zhenji Abducted Yesterday, The Company Where He Works Was Also Searched

At half past ten yesterday morning, an abduction case occurred at the entrance of Lane 214, Dachung Lane, Tongfu Road. The abducted person was Wang Zhenji, from Changshu, 39 years old. There were a total of six abductors, three from a certain foreign country and three Chinese, carrying three handguns, and driving two black-plated cars from the concession, numbers 5060 and 4022. The details are recorded below:

The abduction: Wang Zhenji lived in the upper厢房 of No. 31, Dachung Lane, Lane 214, Tongfu Road. He was the deputy manager and engineer at the Hezong Electrical Company at No. 267, Weihaiwei Road. The company and Wang's residence are quite close, and he usually goes out early and returns late, walking to work. At half past ten yesterday morning, Wang went out from his home as usual to go to the company to work. Just as he arrived at the entrance of Dachung Lane, three foreigners and three Chinese dressed in Chinese and Western clothes suddenly drew out handguns and stopped Wang. At first, Wang didn't know what was happening and tried to resist. He was slapped twice by one of them and forced into black-plated car No. 5060, which was parked near the entrance of the Wanchunxiang Sauce Garden. The others also boarded another black-plated car No. 4022 and started the engine, driving east along Weihaiwei Road. At that time, the guard of Dachung Lane happened to be at the entrance of the lane and witnessed this scene. Being outnumbered, he could not stop it and could only watch Wang get into the car and leave. He then went directly to the Chengdu Road Police Station in charge to report the incident and sent detectives to investigate the scene. A strict investigation is underway.

Also Searched: It is also reported that about an hour after Wang was abducted, at 11:30 noon, three foreigners suddenly arrived at the Hezong Electrical Company (specializing in battery manufacturing) at No. 267, Weihaiwei Road, in car No. 4022 and went directly to the company's office to search it. As a result, they found nothing and got back into the original car and left. According to what the foreigner told the staff of Hezong Electrical Company at that time, the manager was detained for investigation because the company was suspected of something. However, the reason for Wang's abduction and the source of the car are currently being investigated by the police station.

### Forging "Passes", Multiple Criminals Arrested

It was found that the main culprit, Zhu Jianping, had fled upon hearing the news. It was also found that the defendants sold direct passes for more than three yuan each and fake passes for one yuan and five jiao each, and many had already been sold. The defendants were detained and sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court yesterday. The police station's lawyer, Yuan Jiahuang, explained the case and requested an extension for further investigation and interrogation. Then, the detectives reported the process of arresting the defendants, and the plaintiff stated the circumstances of entrusting the application for a pass and the discovery of the forgery. After Judge Zhu Chuzhe questioned the defendants, he ordered that the hearing be adjourned to August 14. The defendants were detained.

### Letter Received

To the Editor,

Regarding the news item "Rice Shop Apprentice Mistakenly Abducted, Released After Clarification" published in your newspaper on July 30, it was stated that our shop sent apprentice Shen Jinxiang to the Songshenghao shop of the same trade on Xingjiapo Road the day before yesterday to collect payments. He was kidnapped by three men holding box cannons on Jiaozhou Road and Xingjiapo Road, forced into a car, and taken south to a house at No. 22 in a certain lane. He was questioned in detail and asked if he was the young master of our rice shop. Shen knew it was a mistaken abduction and told them the truth about being an apprentice. The bandits thought it was useless to detain him and ordered him to leave. Shen escaped. After investigation, our shop has never had such an incident. The above news is obviously a misreport and untrue. We hereby submit this letter, hoping you will investigate and correct it.

Respectfully,

Yuanshengchang Rice Shop

### Grains: Foreign Rice All Goes Into the Hands of Big Dealers, Rice Prices Soar Again to Over Three Yuan, Rice Weevils Not Eliminated, Rice Prices Difficult to Stabilize

Recently, a considerable amount of foreign rice has arrived in Shanghai. The previous day, the Taikoo company's Jinan and Ninghai ships, and the Norwegian ship Herleik, managed by the Gaodeng Foreign Company, etc., brought a total of more than 50,000 bags, as noted in yesterday's newspaper. It is now learned that the Greek ship Hellenie Trader, which directly loaded 24,723 bags from Saigon, also arrived the day before yesterday (the 30th) and docked at Pier 14, Renji Road Bund, for unloading. It was unloaded by noon yesterday, and the ship was immediately moved to another location. Yesterday, the Taikoo company's Nanning ship also arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning, carrying 2,513 bags from Hong Kong, and docked at the company's pier outside the French Concession for unloading.

Yesterday's spot foreign rice was relatively stable in the early morning, but suddenly a fierce surge occurred, increasing by as much as three yuan. At the opening of the morning market, the original dealers firmly held their ground, and the buyers were all waiting to see. The market was flat. Unexpectedly, after a long delay, inland customers desperately sought supplies, and local shops followed suit, resulting in a situation where there were more buyers than sellers. Those with goods hoarded them, and the surge could not be contained. At the close, Saigon No. 1 had reached 56 yuan, 55.5 yuan, and new sharp 54.5 yuan. Yesterday morning, foreign rice was purchased at low prices for spot sales, and the floating goods in the market were sold out early. The big dealers refused to sell at lower prices, and inland Hangzhou gangs issued more than 10,000 new permits and immediately purchased 6,000 bags of spot rice in the market, including the previous stock. Small dealers followed suit, and the market immediately turned upward. Spot rice prices rose by two to three yuan. The No. 2 Siamese rice loaded on the 26th of last month has arrived in batches and is now all in the hands of big dealers. Those who have not covered their positions and inland dealers had to raise prices to inquire. Therefore, after the opening price of 57 yuan, it gradually increased to 60 yuan, which is 3.5 yuan higher than the previous day's 56.5 yuan. Small Siamese rice also increased by three to four yuan, resulting in no transactions. More than 400 tons of Siamese rice were offered for repurchase, and more than 10,000 bags of spot rice were offered, it is said.

Due to competition from foreign glutinous rice, the market for glutinous rice continued to be normal and remained unchanged, maintaining the original levels. Lijing white was 56-57 yuan per hundred, and Changdan was 54-55 yuan per hundred. Hong Kong was 55 yuan per hundred. The arrival of national rice, such as thick and thin japonica rice, was still scarce. It was rumored that the off-market dark trading was good because of the high price of foreign rice, but not as excited as the loss of rice. The selling price was only slightly higher. Changgang fresh clear japonica rice was 65-66 yuan, Wuxi clear japonica rice was 65 yuan, Changzhou Sukun japonica rice was 63-64 yuan, secondary to 61 yuan, and Su 59 yuan. Thin rice was out of stock and not open. Nangang early rice was 63 yuan per original bag, 59 yuan per dan, secondary to Su 57 yuan, etc.

### The Flour Market Turns Stable

Flour: Yesterday, the flour market of various factories turned stable. The price of the flour factory remained at the original price of 15 yuan. Retail transactions on this street were still active, but sales to customers in Nanyang were quiet as soon as there was any movement, because the return of flour from Japan was expected soon and prices were still depreciating. It was heard that the price of the Phoenix brand for this month was only 13.35 yuan, and the price for August futures was 13.5 yuan. There were continuous transactions of 2,000-3,000 bags. Other domestic miscellaneous brands of flour had no formal settlement. According to discussions in the industry, based on the current price of wheat received by Japanese factories, which is 19 yuan, the cost of flour production cannot be less than 13 yuan. Therefore, the factory's intention to sell has turned stable.

Wheat: Yesterday's transactions were still not many, and the market was as tired as usual. The supply from Suxi and other areas was continuous. Both Japanese and Chinese factories lacked a smooth market. Although the sellers had the intention of holding up the prices, it was difficult to reverse the downward trend. It was heard that the purchase price of Japanese factories was only about 18 yuan, which was still 2 yuan lower than that of Chinese factories. Transactions were about 2,000-3,000 bags.

### The Import of Foreign Rice in June and July is Astonishing, More Than 823,300 Bags, Worth 50 Million Yuan in Legal Tender

July was one of the busiest months for foreign rice imports. This newspaper has been investigating and reporting on it daily. Foreign rice arriving in Shanghai in June totaled 167,785 bags. Foreign rice arriving in Shanghai in July totaled 655,598 bags. The total for both months is 823,383 bags, which is a significant amount. In reality, it is probably even more than this number, as there are bound to be more omissions. If calculated at 60 yuan per bag in legal tender, the total value is 49,402,980 yuan, which is more than 3 million US dollars, which is truly lamentable. (Unit: bag, each bag is calculated at 200 kilograms)

### Securities: Domestic Debt Drops in a Straight Line

In the securities grey market yesterday, the market was calculated after deducting the interest of the ninth issue. It was found that the net interest right after deducting income tax was 2.85 yuan. The market price, after deducting this number, was equal to the market price of the previous day. Unexpectedly, after the opening, many parties rushed to sell, and all returned to a little more than 3 yuan, to 3.5 yuan. The shorts took advantage of the situation to exert pressure, and the market price fell in a straight line. For half a day, after deducting the interest rights, it was still a little less than 0.3 to 0.6 or 0.7 yuan. It was inevitable that the drop was too fast. In the afternoon, it caused the short sellers to cover their positions, and in an instant, it rebounded by 0.3, 0.5, or 0.6 yuan. The market's volatility, although due to human factors, was actually controlled by the environment. The trend turned into one of easy highs and difficult lows. Yesterday morning, the Yongkang, Xie Da, and  Fu bought the most, and Jiufeng continued to sell consistently. Xinchang and Shengda also sold off. The market price fell sharply. In the afternoon, the news was better, and the buying interest suddenly increased. Hongda and Renchang collected Class A, and other types, except for Class D, were mostly absorbed by Lianhe, Songmao, Dafeng, and Dakangcheng. Jiufeng increased its short positions, Yongkang slightly sold back, and Yichang and retail investors also settled their transactions. Therefore, the afternoon market rebounded more strongly. As a result, it was 2.65 yuan to 2.9 yuan lower than the Lianli market price. Class D was a little more than 3.4 yuan lower because it did not trade in the afternoon. After deducting the interest rights, the fluctuations were minimal, mostly only 0.1 or 0.2 yuan higher or lower. The total transaction volume was about 900,000 yuan. A simplified table is listed below (the table is for the value after deduction of good interest):

Stock trading: 50 shares of Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company were traded at a price of 11.25 yuan.

Also, yesterday's stock market closed at the Public Industry Association with a very firm trend, but the activity was difficult to sustain. The price remained extraordinarily stable throughout the day. If the New York market can maintain a firm trend, the market conditions here will have more progress. Although investors are currently somewhat doubtful about operations due to the instability of the situation in this port.

London, 30th (Tuesday) Electric: Today, the listed prices of Chinese foreign debts and Far East British companies' stocks have returned to calm. Only the stock of the Mercantile Bank of India, London and China continued to rise by one shilling and three pence, with a price of six pounds sixteen shillings and three pence. There were no changes in the rest.

The market immediately tightened after the opening. Chinese banks and the mainland first ate foreign bank's August US exchange rate of 5.9375 yuan. Later, Chinese merchant speculators and foreign firms also followed suit and scooped up the same month's US exchange rate, and foreign banks were said to have sold the August US exchange rate of 5.90625 yuan and 9375 yuan to Sassoon speculators. When HSBC's listing was announced, the British exchange rate remained unchanged, and the US exchange rate was reduced by 125.

It is estimated that the foreign banks took the August US exchange rate of 5.90625 yuan and 9375 yuan from Sassoon speculators. When the market closed at noon, the market was stable, and as a result, British gold was 3 pence 84375 and the US exchange rate was 5.9375 yuan.

British gold notes fell and then returned to flat. American gold notes once reached 16.92 yuan, but then retreated to 16.62 yuan.

### The Gold Market Goes Against the Decline in Foreign Exchange

Yesterday's Shanghai cash market, after rising sharply, suddenly fell sharply, eventually falling against foreign exchange by 65 yuan. This was actually because the small money shops tended to sell on behalf of the scattered parties, and there was a lack of buyers to maintain it. The confidence of all parties, which had been trending firmly for a long time, has turned tired. The market opened in the morning, following the rising trend of the previous day. The foreign exchange rate was reported tight, and the market opened as high as 5,510 yuan. Due to the buying wind in the silver shop, the high price of 5,535 yuan was seen. In less than half an hour, the foreign exchange rate suddenly broke the soft trend of only tightening and not returning for three days, and turned to return to firmness. The money changers frantically sold off, and those who entered waited and watched. The price gradually fell to 5,410 yuan. Although it rose slightly at noon, it eventually fell again. The closing price was 5,415 yuan, a decrease of 65 yuan. The half-day transaction volume was about 2,000 taels. No market in the afternoon on Wednesday. The price of decorative gold rose and then returned to flat, and customs gold, etc., were all flat.

Gold Falls by 65 Yuan

From the morning, each bar (ten taels), initially because the foreign exchange market was reported tight, there were still many buyers, and the market opened up 30 yuan, to 5,510 yuan. Later, due to the strong advance of the silver shops, it rose again by 25 yuan. The silver shops advanced to the gold shop by 20 taels, to 5,535 yuan. Then, as the foreign exchange rate turned loose, the gold shops, money changers, and silver shops rushed to sell, and at that time, peace rumors suddenly rose in the market, and there were few entrants, so it fell back by 95 yuan. The securities firms exited the silver shop by 20 taels, at 5,440 yuan. Later, thanks to the silver shop and securities firms purchasing, it once rose by more than 20 yuan. However, as the foreign exchange rate continued to ease, the money changers sold again when it was high. In addition, the floating positions absorbed last month were limited to losses and exits, and it fell again by 55 yuan. The money changers advanced to the silver shop by 20 taels, which was slightly less than 5,410 yuan. The selling wind subsided slightly at noon, and it once returned to the edge of 5,450 yuan, but in the end, because the money changers came to sell again, the closing price was still only 5,415 yuan, a decrease of 65 yuan compared to the previous day. The market momentum turned slightly after closing, and transactions were once made at 5,430 yuan. The highest bid was once over 5,440 yuan. The price fluctuated by 125 yuan in half a day. The selling price of the spot gold of the cash shop was several yuan higher than the price of gold, and the purchase price was reduced by 30 yuan. The current standard gold was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there were few trades.

Decorative Gold Rises and then Returns to Flat

For decorative gold per tael in silver buildings, initially Datong Bank still hung 560 yuan, and then at 9:45 it raised 10 yuan, and at 10:20 it returned to 10 yuan. There were no changes after that. It is estimated that Datong Bank still hung 560 yuan, the new banks were similar to the above price, and the purchase was reduced by 30 yuan.

### Financial Review - Continued (End)

— Saint Kai

Up to July 27th

From the above analysis, it is evident that Japan's surge in exports to the Yen Bloc has created a trade deficit for Japan, which is indeed a major crisis for Japan's wartime economy. The Japanese authorities are also deeply aware of this unfavorable situation and have repeatedly imposed restrictions on exports to the Yen Bloc. In July 1938, restrictions were placed on exports to Japanese-occupied areas such as Manchuria, North China, and Central China, including cotton yarn and cotton cloth. Subsequently, these restrictions were gradually extended to wool products, rubber products, felt hats, soap, etc. However, due to the soaring prices within the Yen Bloc, exports to the Yen Bloc remained strong. Consequently, on September 20, 1939, the Japanese Ministry of Commerce and Industry announced the "Regulations for Adjusting Exports to Manchuria, Kwantung, North China, and Central China," stipulating that exports of goods not intended for domestic consumption within the Yen Bloc, goods intended to expand domestic production capacity, and daily necessities for the people could not be exported to the Yen Bloc without approval. Despite these repeated restrictions on trade with the Yen Bloc, the trend continued to rise. Looking at this year's trade statistics, it can be said that Japan's export trade is almost entirely with the Yen Bloc, while its import trade is entirely with third countries.

Recently, the President of the Japanese Planning Board, in a speech, announced the major wartime financial and economic plan decided by the temporary cabinet meeting on July 18th. Among them, the plan for Yen Bloc trade is to maintain the balance of international payments between the parties in order to promote the sound development of the Yen economic group, so that the exchange of materials between Japan and various parts of the Yen area can be smooth, and to seek the stability of the Yen currency and the stabilization of prices. The three key points of this plan are: (1) Without hindering the progress of Japan in maintaining its third-party exports and the scope required for the people's livelihood, Japan should supply as many materials as possible to the Yen area, to the extent permitted by the local situation; (2) In order to adapt to the consumption control policies in various regions and maintain the Yen currency policy, appropriate measures should be selected for the exchange of materials; (3) How to plan for the balance of international payments for the trade surplus of the Yen area.

However, no matter what measures are taken under this plan, it will not reduce the trade difficulties caused to Japan by its trade surplus with the Yen area. On the contrary, the first principle in the plan may increase the trade surplus with the Yen area. It must be understood that if Japan's war of aggression in China continues without stopping, the Yen currency will inflate day by day. However, although the Yen currency can be put into circulation under the bayonets, its value cannot be maintained solely by bayonets. It can only generate its exchange value by exporting goods. As a result, the Yen currency inflates as much as possible, and the more exports to the Yen area, the greater the trade surplus. I would like to provide a statistic here for reference. The following table is the foreign trade index of Japan (with the first half of 1937 as 100):

### Cotton Yarn: Speculation Resurrects; Double Horse Brand Rebounds by Eleven Yuan

The yarn market has turned better and is showing an upward trend again. This is because the exchange rate contracted in the afternoon of the previous day, and people's hearts were excited. As a result, speculation has once again stirred up waves, and the atmosphere is boiling. The bulls have reorganized their forces and come back strongly. The high price once reached 999 yuan. However, it was reported that actual sales were not very smooth, and a major bull instead left the market, causing prices to fall.

The spot yarn market opened this morning. Because the price of gold was slightly higher in the afternoon of the previous day, the bulls generally promoted it vigorously. The market was bustling with activity, and the opening price rose by 20 yuan. The price of 20-count Double Horse brand was 990 yuan, which immediately rose to 999 yuan. However, due to weak transactions from the merchant guilds and the relaxation of drafts, the market sentiment suddenly softened, and prices fell to 983 yuan. It is found that the statistics of transactions in half a day are 1,370 bales. The price of 20-count Double Horse brand rose by 11 yuan. The amount of each guild's purchase is listed as follows:

### Spot Cotton Transactions are Slightly Sparse

The general trend of spot cotton transactions is still ordinary. The factory stomach is not strong. Although Japanese factories have occasional needs, the payment period is still delayed by one month. Chinese factories, in view of the ordinary environment, have absolutely no intention of purchasing and hoarding. In fact, silver funds have not been relaxed. Only occasional transactions between colleagues have been negotiated. The market is also not far from a hovering situation. Tongzhou cotton is 170 yuan, and American cotton is 260 yuan. The transaction is 300 to 400 pieces delivered at the warehouse.

Another news is the market price of foreign cotton. The New York cotton market is in good condition. The industry has made some purchases. The prices of Wall Street stocks are high, and some short positions have been covered. As a result, the closing price rose by four or five points compared to the previous day. The Indian market is calm. Yesterday, the forecast fell by more than one rupee.

The trade of foreign cotton in Shanghai has been very quiet recently. All parties are holding a wait-and-see attitude due to the end of the month. Yesterday, due to the tightening of exchange rates, people's hearts were strengthened.

### Oil Cake: Domestic Sales of Soybean Cake Continue

Since the soybean cake market turned active at the end of last week, domestic sales have continued unabated. In addition, the price of soybeans is high, so the market atmosphere has been strongly supported, and market prices have risen even higher. Although there were no inquiries for exports yesterday, the market price still increased by three or four jiao. It is estimated that 3,000 pieces of Shengji cake were sold at 11 yuan, 100 pieces of Changji cake were sold at 10 yuan and 5 jiao and a half, and 1,200 pieces of Feizi cake were sold at 10 yuan and 9 jiao and a half to 8 jiao. 1,500 pieces of Qingzhong cake were sold at 10 yuan and 2 jiao to 10 yuan, it is said.

### Piece Goods: Spot Sales of Cotton Cloth Remain Good

Yesterday, the cloth market initially rose and then weakened, and as a result, it rebounded again, presenting a hovering situation. The range of sales has narrowed, with a high-low difference of only one jiao and a half. Spot sales remain good, and the attitude of those holding goods is quite calm. However, inventory is still extremely thick. Future transactions lack interest from buyers. This street traded more than 500 pieces of spot coarse cloth, grey cloth, bleached and dyed cloth, and more than 200 pieces of future velvet cloth. The Fujian guild traded more than 100 pieces of dyed twill and serge. The Guangdong and Hong Kong guilds traded nearly 200 pieces of twill and dyed cloth. The Wenzhou and Ningbo guilds traded nearly 100 pieces of Lunchang dyed cloth, Yihua twill, and coarse cloth. The northern Yan and Tianjin guilds traded more than 100 pieces of coarse cloth and velvet cloth.

### Sugar Market: Coarse White Sugar Rises by About Two Yuan

Yesterday, the sugar market rose because of external rumors that the situation in the Dutch East Indies was deteriorating and that the source of Dutch sugar might be obstructed. Therefore, the guild's price was raised. The spot price of 24 coarse white sugar at the local warehouse was 67 yuan and a half to 68 yuan and a half, while the price at the foreign warehouse was initially 67 yuan and 3 jiao to 5 jiao, and rose further to 68 yuan and 68 yuan and a half in the afternoon. The price of transshipment goods for delivery on August 2nd was 51 yuan and a half to 51 yuan and 8 jiao, and 52 yuan to 53 yuan in the afternoon. The price for delivery on the 15th was 52 yuan and a half to 53 yuan and 4 jiao. The price of Taikoo coarse white B mark was 72 yuan and a half to 73 yuan in the morning, and 73 yuan and a half to 74 yuan in the afternoon. The price of Dutch red sugar at the local warehouse was 61 yuan and a half, and the price of local factory snow white was 68 yuan to 69 yuan, a rise of two yuan and a half. The price of Ben No. 1 ice sugar was 90 yuan, and the price of Jingming ice sugar was 91 yuan and a half, both rising by three yuan. Also, 5,900 bags of sugar arrived from Hong Kong yesterday, and another 4,000 bags arrived, which were transferred to Tianjin.

### Seafood: Black Pepper Falls by Two Yuan

Recently, the black pepper market has continued to decline due to sluggish sales. Black Big and No. 1 pepper fell by another two yuan, and sold for 101 yuan yesterday. However, white pepper remains stable. The price of Wendao goods is 202 yuan, and the price of Dutch goods is 190 yuan.

### North-South Goods: More than 3,000 Boxes of Haikou Branches Arrive

After the new Haikou branches were launched, due to the blockade of the Haikou in Zhejiang and Fujian by a certain party, the local merchants telegraphed to the production area to stop loading. However, the third batch has already been shipped and is en route. Yesterday, a total of 3,300 boxes arrived by the Qingyuan ship, and it is expected that the market will open within a few days.

### Metals: American Bar Iron Market is Firm

The trade of American bar iron has long been stopped by foreign merchants. Those who can support the remaining situation rely only on the occasional purchases of toy factories, printing factories, cigarette factories, and canneries in this street. However, sales have also been greatly reduced compared to the past (because their products are sluggish in the market). It is found that about 100 boxes were traded yesterday. The market was firm yesterday because the exchange rate tightened again, and people's hearts became firm. As yesterday's asking price for unified floral patterns was 120 yuan, large sizes were 130 to 140 yuan, and small floral patterns were sold for about 110 yuan per box.

### Old Newspaper Excerpts - 67 Years Ago (462) (See This Newspaper from the Twelfth Year of Tongzhi, Qing Dynasty)

Local Constable

The system of local constables originated from the new law of Wang Anshi during the Song Dynasty. The law was based on the Rites of Zhou, where one person was appointed in each village to be responsible. This was a variation and expansion of the baojia system. Therefore, all the new laws were abolished, but the baojia system has been followed to this day. Similarly, the establishment of local constables has also been maintained. Considering the meaning of the name, a local constable is one who is responsible for the safety of the local area. In the beginning, they were generally selected from among the more reputable people in the village. Later, the original intention was gradually lost, and many local constables in the villages were idle and unscrupulous people. As a result, the establishment of local constables became more of a detriment than a benefit. Up to this day, the further we are from the past, the more corrupt people's hearts become, and the more degraded the local baojia system becomes. The weak ones fill the position in name only, and are incapable of doing anything. The strong ones collude with government runners and have private dealings with clerks. They might say that so-and-so in the county is their relative, or that Mr. So-and-so in the yamen is their good friend. The ignorant villagers, believing that they have connections with the government, dare not offend them in the slightest, lest they incur blame. As a result, they abuse their power, oppress the villagers, demand tribute during festivals, and extort gifts for birthdays. Whenever there is an incident, they complicate matters, indulge in their greed, and carry out their cunning schemes. In famous and respected families, they might restrain themselves and not be too reckless. However, in remote and poor villages, far from the city, where the government's eyes and ears cannot reach, these people become even more unscrupulous and do whatever they want.

### Trust and Understanding

Trust and understanding are related. The amount of trust one has is determined by the amount of understanding. Trust and distrust depend entirely on understanding or lack thereof. This is true in all interactions between people. If I understand someone, I trust them. The clearer the understanding, the greater the trust.

All the disputes in the world, whether international, national, familial, or between individuals, are due to a lack of understanding of God, a lack of trust in God, and a lack of reverence for God, allowing God to be our master and our king. At the same time, it is also because we overestimate ourselves. "I" want this, "I" want that. The word "I" is piled higher than Mount Tai. In everything, we rely on "my" intelligence, "my" talent, and "my" social skills, driving God to the far corners of the sky, with no God in our minds at all.

Many poets who believed in God in the past said in their poems: "In God I trust; I will not be afraid. What can mortal man do to me?" (Psalm 56). "Have mercy on me, O God, have mercy on me, for in you my soul takes refuge; in the shadow of your wings I will take refuge, till the disaster has passed..." (Psalm 57).

Dear readers! We believe that there is a God in the universe. We understand Him, we trust Him. Looking at it vertically, for two thousand years, Christianity has had countless believers who have accomplished many great works because they understood this God and trusted this God. Looking at it horizontally, although wars are raging in various countries of the world today, the missionary work, educational work, medical work, and various other charitable works of Christianity are still moving forward without discouragement because they understand this God and trust this God.

Are you also willing to understand this God so that after understanding Him, you can trust His leadership in all aspects of your life, no longer suffer from gains and losses, and become a persistent and unyielding person? (Reprinted on August 4th)

Readers who wish to study in detail, please write to the Literary Evangelism Society at 351 Avenue Edward VII, Shanghai, and will receive a detailed reply.

### Basic Principles of Child Education

— Compiled and Written

Many people kindly and simply ask: "How should children be educated?" This is truly a long story and almost impossible to answer. However, here are some basic principles of child education that may be used as reference material for parents with good intentions:

(1) Be gentle, patient, firm, not angry, and do not lose your temper.

(2) Consider everything for the benefit and future of the child, and administer rewards and punishments fairly and justly.

(3) Do not be afraid of crying.

(4) Replace prohibition with encouragement.

(5) Minimize punishment as much as possible. When punishing, be fair and make the child understand where they went wrong.

(6) When a problem occurs, it should be resolved immediately or as soon as possible. Do not delay unless necessary.

(7) Do not scold children in front of others. Never hurt a child's self-esteem.

(8) Help children do things, but only to a certain extent, with the aim of cultivating children's independence and self-reliance.

(9) Be consistent in attitude.

(10) Parents should be consistent in attitude.

(11) Set a good example.

(12) Treat children as sensible people.

### Ten Agreements

— Wang Chuan

Yesterday, I received two letters from readers of Free Talk, forwarded by the editor, saying that after reading my article "I Bless My Younger Brother," they were very envious that I had such a younger brother and hoped that I would publish the ten agreements that my brother and I had made in Free Talk. Now I have obtained my brother's consent and copied them down, adding some explanations.

(1) The signatories shall not purchase foreign goods, except when unavoidable;

(2) When going to school or going out, they shall not take first-class trams;

(3) From the date of signing the agreement until the victory of the war of resistance, they shall not watch movies or dramas, except for those that are meaningful;

(4) The signatories must learn two special skills (within one year);

(5) About one-tenth of the monthly allowance should be used to buy extracurricular books to read;

(6) Read the newspaper every day;

(7) Write a diary every day;

(8) Do not quarrel with A-Ling

(9) Do not play chess every day to kill useful time;

(10) Do not smoke cigarettes.

The above ten articles were signed in April last year, more than a year ago. In that year, we were very careful at first, fearing that we would violate the agreement. After three or four months, we got used to it. For example, when it comes to taking the tram, as soon as the tram arrives at the station, I will step into the third-class carriage without thinking. Even if I meet friends on the road, I don't feel any unnaturalness.

Some of the articles in this agreement were made entirely to suit my younger brother and me. For example, article 6, A-Ling is the maid in my house. She has a meddlesome and gossipy mouth, so my younger brother often quarreled with her in the past. This article can be said to be biased towards restricting my younger brother. Other things like smoking and playing chess are my shortcomings, so the agreement was made for me.

When my younger brother and I "met" to discuss the agreement, my younger brother also raised the question of how to punish those who violated it. My younger brother and I have not yet become independent in terms of economy, so I came up with a method of spiritual punishment. That is, whoever violates the agreement must sit silently for an hour. During that hour, they are only allowed to sit and repent, and are not allowed to speak. This method was adopted by us and proved to be very effective.

When the other party violates the agreement, you must not gloat, but instead show that you forgive him this time and advise him not to do it again next time. This will make the other party feel a kind of spiritual reproach, and they will definitely not commit the same mistake easily in the future. I think this method can also be used by parents to punish their children.

### Ordinary

— Fang Jing

Many people ignore the ordinary.

But we say: There is learning in the ordinary.

Look, wasn't Watt's invention of steam encountered in the ordinary act of boiling water? Wasn't Newton's discovery of gravity obtained from the ordinary event of an apple falling to the ground?

There is learning in the ordinary, may everyone pay attention to the ordinary!

The Hawthorne Case

### The Homecoming of the Dancing Queen

— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing

"Hawthorne, it's only half past nine now. Jiang Anna has only been back for two hours of sleep, it would be unreasonable for us to wake her up."

Hawthorne frowned. "We can't worry about that, the matter is urgent and can't be delayed too long. I only hope to talk to her for fifteen minutes, and she can sleep again."

We have found the door to room 306. Hawthorne hesitated slightly, then bent the index finger of his right hand and knocked on the door three times. There was no reply inside. I noticed that there was no doorbell next to the door, so I also raised my fist to help him knock twice. The reply finally came.

"Who? - Who's knocking?"

The voice was loud and hurried, clearly containing some fear.

I said in a surprised whisper: "That's a man's voice! Can't we be wrong?"

Hawthorne shook his head. "Is that worth wondering? Can't you hear that this is a voice startled from sleep - Damn!" After he finished speaking, he turned around, preparing to turn back.

There was a second voice inside: "Who is it? What's the matter?" This was a woman's voice. I said again: "It's Anna. Why are you leaving?"

Hawthorne suddenly sank his face. "What are we going to do in there?... Alas, the corrupt Shanghai, the cursed sixth commandment!" He quickly walked towards the elevator room, a kind of annoyance and grief floating on his face, and a long sigh came out of his mouth.

Hawthorne had no further words, but I had already understood. I really felt disappointed and couldn't help but sigh inwardly: "The cursed sixth commandment!"

As we walked down the stone steps of the apartment, Hawthorne asked me as he opened the car door with the key. "Are we going back?"

"No, let's find Zhao Boxiong."

"Do you know his address too?" Because when Jin Mei and old Mao Wu Ma talked just now, they didn't mention Zhao Boxiong's address, and Hawthorne didn't ask about it either. (62)

Children

### Struggle

— Pinpin

Those who sow in tears will reap with songs of joy. Those who go out weeping, carrying seed to sow, will return with songs of joy, carrying sheaves with them.

——"Psalm" 126

Life needs tempering, life is a struggle.

For example, a seed buried in the cold ground, beaten by the north wind, and drowned by rain and snow, what a great difficulty this is; but it is not afraid of tempering, clenches its teeth and struggles, and survives the winter, the seed breaks through everything and sprouts, and the sun first gives it a baptism, what a great joy this is. If the seed cannot withstand the severe cold, it will remain in the dark forever. - Life is just such a struggling seed.

Winter is long, but spring will always come; suffering may be heavy, but happiness will always approach you step by step. We can say that there is heavy suffering in the world, but if you know how to struggle, difficulties will be picked open for you, and you will find that the crushed cave is actually a happy gemstone. Do you want to get the gemstone? You must first learn to endure hardship.

You must have a pair of hands that are calloused, a pair of feet that are blistered and swollen, a chest covered with scars, and a mouth without saliva (you stumble in the desert of life, and a heart like a camel: these are your weapons, on the battlefield of life. Dragged a heavy cart of a thousand catties, walked a thousand miles of thorny roads, suffered a thousand whippings, shouted a thousand times of Hang Yu, your suffering is enough - look, an oasis over there!

Struggle, fall and get up again, struggle again, and paradise is ahead. This is a long journey, but once you reach your destination, the glorious crown will be placed on your head.

I don't admit that babies don't need to struggle, look at how they grab things and learn to walk. Many people want to learn from babies, thinking that there is happiness without struggle, this is an illusion, unless you learn to rot - a rotting corpse is cursed, quickly turn back and learn from the seed that overwinters.

The so-called camel's heart is unwavering." There are mirages in the desert, be careful, although it is not a material difficulty, it is a temptation for the spirit. In a lifetime, I don't know how many vicious temptations jump around, you can't waver, otherwise, your destiny is like a fish on a hook. The camel ignores the mirage and walks with a calm and determined pace: you must do this. Once you have an unwavering spirit, no temptation can hook you, what are you afraid of, brave man, your spirit is also armored.

All the maxims, fairy tales, creeds, biographies, all talk about the same thing: struggle, then victory. Are you crying now? Thank it, you will laugh because of it. We are struggling indefinitely, and the time for us to turn over has also arrived. Break through difficulties, kick away temptations, struggle, liberation appears, do you say right?

### Ode to Children

— Xiu Bi

I don't know when, I became a person who likes to play and live with children.

Naive emotions, pure hearts, no fraud, no schemes.

In their dictionaries, there is no hypocrisy, in their simple smiles, there is no hidden knife.

They jump, they sing, they say whatever they want, they don't know sarcasm, they don't know how to say one thing and mean another. They also don't know how to keep their secrets.

They often regard all people in the world as innocent and non-deceptive as themselves. How do they know that the sins of the world have long since caused adults to lose their honesty and non-deception? Therefore, they are easily deceived and cheated.

They are also often lovers of truth, and in their childish words, immortal truths are often revealed. They love the country, love freedom, and love all the goodness and beauty in the world.

They are also often lovers of light, they cry or tremble when they encounter darkness, and they laugh or jump when they encounter light. They are lovers of light, enemies of darkness and demons.

Ah! Children! Since I have encountered too much deception in the world, I have become your best companion. Your naiveté has retained my childlike heart.

### Dorothy Lamour

— Written by

Dorothy Lamour is not only good at acting, but also at writing. In the past, newspapers and magazines often published her articles on beauty and fitness. Recently, she published a short confessional essay, which, although having the side effect of promotion, is not without considerable value. I have translated it below:

In every city where I star in a film, I completely separate myself from America. For example, in "Her Jungle Love," "Jungle Princess," "Typhoon" and "Aloma of the South Seas," I always wrap myself in a sarong and drift on a tropical desert island. In "Alaskan Holiday," I am in Alaska; in "South of the Border," I am in Mexico; in "Last Train from Madrid," I am in Spain. But no matter what, I was born in New Orleans, and my ancestors have lived there for generations.

Movies are appreciated by people regardless of nationality. In principle, Hollywood should try to make universal films as much as possible. However, films like "The Iron Horse," "The Covered Wagon," and simple Hardy family and Jones family films are purely "American" films, but they are welcomed by various countries.

Therefore, I hope to have the opportunity to star in an American film. Perhaps I am a little envious, because British actresses like Madeleine Carroll and Merle Oberon always play American women in their Hollywood films. This is not that I want to exclude "imports," because there are countless excellent actors from abroad in Hollywood, and the company will never do anything so stupid. However, I think it is always a good idea for Americans to play Americans.

### Cantonese Opera on a Deserted Island

— Lishi

The base of Cantonese opera is mostly in Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Macau. It is also distributed in Southeast Asia, such as Singapore, where there are many Cantonese overseas Chinese. As for Shanghai, before the "January 28th" Incident, Cantonese opera was often performed at the Guang Wu Stage on Qiujiang Road. Before the "August 13th" Incident, it was performed at the Guangdong Grand Theater on North Sichuan Road and at the Mingzhu Grand Theater (later renamed Haizhu Grand Theater) on Fusheng Road. The Shanghai Grand Theater at the intersection of Qiujiang Road also performed for a long time. After the August 13th Incident, the Cantonese opera troupes returned south one after another. Later, the Cantonese Opera Association in Hong Kong prohibited troupes from performing in the occupied areas. Therefore, after the war moved westward and Shanghai fell, the troupes did not revisit this place for a long time. Only the Wing On Amateur Opera Troupe performed Cantonese opera for disaster relief until last year, when two or three actors came to Shanghai for leisure and formed a "Ren Shou Nian" troupe, which performed for a long time at the Gengxin Stage. Later, due to poor organization, lack of talent, and housing problems, it only appeared briefly for a few shows. This spring, another "Da Luo Tian" Cantonese opera troupe was formed, but because the stage was too small and the seats were uncomfortable (because it was only temporarily located in the small theater of the Dahua Hotel), they struggled to survive until today, and have moved again to the small theater in the Xiaoyao Ballroom to perform.

Cantonese opera in Shanghai can only be watched by Cantonese overseas Chinese. Outsiders simply do not understand it at all. Therefore, even if the skills are profound and the voice is pleasant, it can only be appreciated by Cantonese overseas Chinese alone, and cannot be enjoyed by the public like Peking opera. Also, because the lyrics of Cantonese opera are special, the only way to attract people from other provinces to watch is to print and distribute the lyrics for people to follow and listen, so as to avoid cultural barriers in the drama.

### Old Shadows, New Copies

— Luo Cun

The first domestic sound film with speech was "After the Rain," produced by Huaguang Company, and premiered at the Xinguang Grand Theater on July 1, 1931.

The first Western sound film was "Captain Swagger," which premiered at the Xia Ling Pei Ke Grand Theater—now the Dahua—in February 1929.

The earliest cinema in Shanghai was the "Hongkou Grand Theater," founded by a Westerner named Lamos.

The first person to quarrel with a company over the order of advertising rankings was Xu Qinfang.

Eight years ago, the Educational Film Association held a domestic film competition, and as a result, "Humanity" was ranked first.

In June 1933, Mr. and Mrs. Douglas Fairbanks came to China to film in Tibet, but were rejected by the Chinese government and abandoned the plan.

In April 1933, Luo Mingyou opened the Lianhua Grand Theater in Manila. On the opening day, Zi Luolan and Chen Yanyan performed on stage, and the situation was unprecedented.

When the late actress Ruan Lingyu was buried, more than 20,000 fans voluntarily participated in the funeral, and the situation at that time can be said to be unprecedented.

### Shaoxing Native Place Association Hosts Fundraising and Low-Priced Grain Amusement Fair

— Xin Ying

Everyone knows that this time the rice shortage in Shaoxing is quite serious. Until now, the food panic in the seven counties of Shaoxing has not been resolved. Therefore, in order to relieve the fellow villagers, the Shaoxing Shanghai Native Place Association, in addition to running around appealing to all walks of life, will hold a four-day amusement fundraising and low-priced grain fair at the Carlton Grand Theater from August 1st to 4th. According to the scheduled entertainment program, the first and second days will be Yue opera performances, and the third and fourth days will be Peking opera performances.

Regarding Yue opera, the daytime play "The Sinking Fragrance Fan" and the nighttime play "The Sad History of Liang Zhu" have been scheduled for the first day. The daytime play "Pan Fu Suo Fu" and the nighttime play "Green Jade Hairpin" will be performed on the second day. The actors include Yao Shuijuan, Tu Xinghua, Shang Fangchen, Zhu Su'e, Shi Yinhua, Ma Zhanghua, Wang Shuihua, Lü Shengkui, Li Xiaonong, Xing Zhuqin and more than twenty others.

The Peking opera program has been scheduled for the third day's daytime plays as "Running to the Moon," "Taking Luoyang," "Yin Yang River," "Beheading the Son at the Gate," "Elegant View Tower," and "Cutting Hair to Replace the Head." Nighttime plays include "Five Flower Cave," "Old General Wins the Victory," "Mu Kezhai," "Nine More Days," "Farewell Kiln," "Night Battle with Ma Chao," "Baolian Lantern," and "Splitting the Mountain to Rescue the Mother." The fourth day's daytime plays are "Iron Bow Marriage," "Sea Tide Pearl," "Dragon and Phoenix Auspiciousness," and "Eight Great Hammers." Nighttime plays include "Colored Building Matching," "Attack on Eastern Wu," "Song Shi Hui," "Siping Mountain," and Hong Jing Xi.

Actors such as Zhou Xinfang, Zhao Ruquan, Li Ruchun, Mao Shilai, Ai Shiju, Zhang Yipeng, Feng Zihe, Wang Xichun, Huang Guiqiu, Yuan Shihai, Jiang Miaoxiang, and more than twenty others.

From the above-arranged programs, it is not difficult for us to see that both Yue opera and Peking opera are very exciting. It is said that enthusiastic people from all walks of life are very active in purchasing tickets this time. It is the same as watching a play, but this time it can save many Shaoxing compatriots. Moreover, famous actors perform famous plays, which not only satisfies the eyes but also helps the disaster-stricken people. It is really a win-win situation, so why not do it!

### East, South, West, North

After Li Qinian arrived in Shanghai, the first film she starred in has been decided as "Liang Hongyu."

Chen Yunshang's new work "The Creation of Heaven and Earth" will begin filming, directed by Zhang Shankun, with a script by Zhou Yibai.

Zheng Junli, Han Zhongliang and others, who were sent by "China" to the Xikang area to film documentaries on the anti-Japanese construction of various ethnic groups, have arrived in Qinghai and are starting work.

### How is a Movie Made? (3)

— De Gang

(4) The Use and Skill of the Camera: When the photographer shakes the dial of the camera, he records the actions of the actors on the film. According to physics and optical research, we know that if sixteen or more still images are moved in front of an ordinary person's eyes per second, then the eyes will not feel discontinuous. The structure of the camera is based on this principle. Under normal rhythm, it can film sixteen images per second, which is equivalent to the dial rotating twice. If the photographer speeds up the dial rate, rotating it four times per second, then the actions of the characters in the filmed film will be "slow motion." Every move of the actors is twice as slow as normal. This can also be said to be an example of Einstein's theory of relativity. If, on the contrary, the photographer shakes the dial slowly, then the actions of the characters in the film will be particularly accelerated. For example, a plot we often see in ordinary films: a car thief speeds away in a car, followed by many police officers desperately driving motorcycles to chase after him. Their flying-like speed is shocking, but in fact, this is entirely a photographic technique. Originally, the actors playing robbers and police officers drove the cars slowly and moved forward very slowly when filming, but the photographer shook the dial particularly slowly, making the actions seem to become extremely fast. In addition to this method, cutting out one of every two films can also make the actions seem faster.

Also, in the film, we often see that when one scene ends and enters another different scene, the people and things in the first scene gradually disappear like fog, while the characters in the second scene gradually appear slightly transparent. This is also achieved by using camera skills. The method is very simple. When filming the end of the first scene, the photographer gradually closes the lens aperture, so the characters gradually disappear. When the lens aperture is gradually opened, the characters in the second scene gradually appear. People who do not know it think this is a very mysterious and interesting thing.
