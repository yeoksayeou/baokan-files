### Japanese Reinforcements for Baotou Aim to Invade Wuyuan

The Japanese forces in the Wuyuan-Baotou area, following the previous attack by Chinese troops into Baotou city, engaged in fierce street battles for several days, annihilating the main force of the Japanese army and inflicting heavy damage. The Japanese were filled with shame and anger. Since the middle of this month, they have gathered Japanese troops from various areas in northern Suiyuan and southern Shanxi, gradually concentrating them around Baotou. The so-called commander-in-chief of the Japanese garrison in Mengjiang also rushed to Baotou to personally command, attempting to launch another full-scale invasion towards Wuyuan and Linhe. The victorious Chinese forces in this area have long been aware of the Japanese situation and are preparing to defend against them. It will be difficult for the Japanese to succeed. (23rd Dispatch)

### A Certain Traveler Discusses the Situation in Lanzhou

Chongqing: According to a certain traveler who recently traveled through the northwestern provinces and returned here, in a radio address today, he spoke of the situation in Lanzhou, saying that one might feel that Soviet influence has spread to Lanzhou, as Russian signs can be seen in the streets and Russian faces can occasionally be seen. However, every time they are seen, they are invariably followed by a group of children, shouting "Sir," "Sir" incessantly. This is because when the first Soviet aviators arrived in Lanzhou, they did not know what term of address would be best. Naturally, they did not want to be called "foreign devils," and calling them "comrades" felt too Bolshevik. Later, it was decided to have people call them "Sir," so today, any white person appearing in the streets receives the honorific title of "Sir." This is the only extent of Soviet influence seen in Lanzhou. (24th Reuters Dispatch)

### The Chinese Government Recognized by Britain is the National Government; British Prime Minister Chamberlain's Statement in the House of Commons

Editorial

### Stabilizing Flour and Wheat to Secure the Rice Market

Just as the tide of rice manipulation subsides, a wave of flour and wheat manipulation arises. Manipulation is already unforgivable, let alone when aimed at essential food supplies for the people, seeking to monopolize and profit! Harming the people's livelihood and endangering society are reasons enough to seek an immediate halt to such practices.

The usual ratio between flour and rice prices is four to one. Sometimes, it varies depending on the market conditions of flour and rice. However, the current flour price not only matches but exceeds the rice price, which must be considered an extraordinary change. The weight of each bag of flour was changed from 50 pounds to 49 pounds in May of the 13th year of the Republic of China to meet international flour standards, which is approximately 44.45 *jin*. Yet, the price of eleven yuan and several *jiao* for recycled flour, when converted to the weight of one *shi*, is higher than the limited price of rice. Even at the factory wholesale price, it is not much different from the price of one *shi* of rice. If there is no human manipulation, how could the price of flour be so high?

Looking at the cause of the price increase, the highest price of wheat was only six yuan, five or six *jiao*. By late July, the situation gradually changed, with some scrambling to be the first to hoard. In mid-August, the price of rice was nearly thirty yuan, and the price of flour was also six yuan. By late August, the price of rice was thirty-eight or thirty-nine yuan, the price of wheat was ten yuan, and the price of flour was as high as six yuan, four or five *jiao*. In mid-September, the price of flour jumped past the seven-yuan mark. However, according to a survey at the end of September, there were still over two million bags of flour and over five hundred thousand bags of wheat in storage. Therefore, the market in October and November was still calm. By the end of November, the price of flour was seven yuan and six *jiao*, and the price of wheat was twelve yuan and two *jiao*. Once it entered December, the price of rice was as high as forty-seven or forty-eight yuan, and the price of flour rose almost every day. By the time the two concessions limited the price of rice twice, the price of flour was already as high as eight yuan and seven *jiao*. On the first day of trading this year, the price of flour opened at nine yuan, with the customer wholesale price opening at nine yuan and five *jiao*, and wheat at fifteen yuan and a half. By the 16th, the long-rumored ten-yuan flour price was finally realized. Afterward, manufacturers maintained the original ten-yuan wholesale price to avoid intervention. However, those involved were unwilling to sacrifice much, even refusing to sell a few hundred bags at a time. In reality, it was equivalent to having prices without a market. Imported flour had even reached twelve yuan, and the price of wheat was selling at twenty yuan. With such hoarding and manipulation continuing unabated, it is impossible for the price of flour to fall naturally. Why must the market prices of flour and wheat follow the price of rice so closely? There is no necessary reason, it is a matter of human action. They manipulate flour and wheat, in addition to manipulating rice, to achieve their goal of manipulating the entire people's food supply. The trend described above clearly shows this. It seems that they want to exhaust those who maintain the food supply, causing them to abandon the price limits.

The rapid advance, with four consecutive days of increases, is a testament to the fact that they see that since the price of rice has been limited, they can do whatever they want with flour and wheat! Then, they gradually increased the price to the high price of ten yuan. Moreover, the price of recycled flour is usually five to one *jiao* lower than the factory wholesale price. By mid-August, the factories limited the opening price, so they bought back recycled flour, and the price was instead one or two *jiao* higher than the factory wholesale price. Recently, the price has exceeded by one yuan and several *jiao*. Although the price of recycled flour is said to be the "wild price", in reality, it can be regarded as the black market price of factory flour. The official price does not rise, but the black market price rises frequently. Does this accord with the purpose of maintaining the local food supply? If the manufacturers truly have the sincerity to maintain the food supply, why do they limit the supply for actual sales, driving people to seek recycled flour? The so-called recycled flour relies entirely on a warehouse receipt from the factory. The factory may be able to shirk responsibility by saying that the warehouse receipt transaction is a matter for the customers. It is difficult to know the truth behind the "clever opening." The factory's actions are even more suspicious, sometimes restricting production, sometimes restoring the original volume, and sometimes restricting customer sales. Once the price increases, they still supply as usual. This is extremely contradictory, and the profit is in the middle. Now, they are not only restricting customer sales but also restricting street sales, and they are also forcing customers to clear their warehouse receipts. If the price of flour and wheat does not decrease but increases after restricting customer sales, then the so-called restricting the supply is not a clear sign of hoarding and that clearing warehouse receipts is a prelude to raising prices? Therefore, it is rumored in the market that factories will use the high price of wheat and the difficulty in settling the price of foreign wheat as a smokescreen to deceive the public, believing that they will continue to raise prices in the future. On the other hand, using warehouse receipts as a tool to suppress the result of warehouse receipts will make it impossible for customers to ship goods, and they will eventually have to terminate the contract. Then the goods will return to the original owner, and they will be able to ship the goods. Then, once sold, the market can reduce this inventory. Even if the price is stable for a while, they can then raise the price and sell without hesitation. There are also those who say that there is still a small amount of foreign flour circulating in the city, so they want to take advantage of the factory flour being closed to transfer foreign flour to the customers. When the foreign flour is exhausted, then all that is available in Shanghai will be the factory's flour and Japanese flour. When the time comes to monopolize and hoard, then no one will dare to do anything, and there will be no way to do anything. All of these rumors cannot be fully believed, but considering the era of the exchange, the factory manipulated the standard flour and used all kinds of tricks. It's obvious that now, when rice is expensive, it is a great opportunity to manipulate. Why would they not manipulate? The reality is already very clear.

Some say that southerners eat rice, and the price of flour is expensive, so the impact is still small. In fact, flour and rice both occupy the most important part of Shanghai's food supply. Most Shanghai households and workers use noodles to satisfy their hunger in the early morning and late at night. There are also many people who use noodles at normal times, and it is even more so after rice becomes expensive. Therefore, it is not limited to northerners that flour and wheat are important foods. Fried dough sticks and pancakes can be said to be the most common and popular foods. Now, pancakes are as thin as coins, and fried dough sticks are as thin as ropes, and they must be several times their old value to satisfy hunger. It can be seen that the manipulation of flour prices threatens the food supply of the general population. After rice prices were limited and the two *gongbu* strictly cracked down on the market, although there were some who secretly tried to sabotage, they no longer dared to manipulate it openly, while flour and wheat were still active and free. For this reason, the price of flour used to follow the price of rice, but now the price of rice is rising secretly along with the price of flour and wheat. Recently, the rice market once sold high *geng* rice at the limited price, and recently, it has used Su Tong *geng* as the standard. To sell medium *geng* as high *geng* at the limited price is sabotage and raising the price. Therefore, some say that manipulating flour and wheat is because they were unsuccessful in rice. Now, they are combining rice, flour, and wheat into one piece. The momentum is greater, and they can also affect each other. They sing together, is there any day of stability for the food supply?

Then, is the current plan still to limit the price of flour? Yes, but not entirely. To maintain the price limit, there must be a determination to eradicate the black market. To eradicate the black market and implement the price limit, it is also necessary to manage the market and pay attention to distribution. Price limits can only help in an emergency and cannot be a long-term solution. Observing the general trend, there are many more waves in the future of grain. The manipulation of grain is not just an empty threat. They have something to rely on and have the strength. This is why those who have handled the food supply in the past have faced many obstacles and sabotage. As for the management of the flour market, it is easier than rice because it is a manufactured product, and production and sales are easy to equalize, and the cost is not difficult to audit. As for the source of wheat, for the current plan, Australian wheat has been settled, and the United States will dispose of its 25 million surplus wheat, and there is talk of subsidizing the transportation and sale of wheat to China, Hong Kong, and the Philippines. If this is the case, it will help the food supply in China. Stabilizing flour and wheat stabilizes the rice market and stabilizing the rice market improves the people's livelihood. The concession authorities are working for the welfare of millions of people and should continue to take measures to reassure the public.

### Letter to the Nation's Military and Civilians from Chairman Chiang

Chongqing (Continued from yesterday) (II) Let's start with "Good Neighborly Friendship." One clause contains the following: First, "completely carrying each other along," and second, "comprehensively pursuing means of mutual assistance and linkage." I have compared the meaning of "linkage" to a chain dragging our descendants into the eighteen layers of hell. I believe everyone can recall this. As for "completely carrying each other along," this is truly a new term recently created by the Japanese. Wang Zhaoming said, "Konoe's statement is clear in outline," but what the Japanese want is "completeness." Wang Zhaoming's newspaper once said, "Economic cooperation has a scope and limitations," but the Japanese answered with "completeness." What is "completeness"? There is an idiom in Chinese, "completeness without a trace." Also, anything vague and unmemorable is called "completely forgotten." The so-called completeness is simply without boundaries or traces. To carry each other along to the point of no distinction or trace is, unless it is a "merger," not an explanation of complete swallowing?

(III) The puppet organization must first recognize "Manchukuo," and then Japan and Manchukuo will respect China's territorial sovereignty. Imagine, recognizing the puppet state of Manchukuo while still saying they respect China's territory and sovereignty, and that China's territory and sovereignty are to be respected by the puppet of Manchukuo, carved out of our land. Is this mockery or insult?

(IV) Not only propaganda and education, but also politics, diplomacy, and trade that could damage mutual friendship will be prohibited, not only now, but also in the future. In other words, anything within China that is inconvenient for Japan will be permanently prohibited.

(V) Regarding relations with third countries, measures that violate the principle of mutual cooperation will not be adopted. This means that China's diplomatic power will henceforth completely obey Japan, with no room for freedom or independence. Is this not completely reducing China to a Japanese appendage? In addition, advisors will be dispatched to the "New Central Government," and in areas of intense integration and other specific regions. This means deploying layers of surveillance personnel throughout China.

(VI) To cooperate in cultural integration and creation means that China will henceforth not be allowed to have an independent culture, nor will Chinese people be allowed to have their own cultural creations.

(VII) Furthermore, regarding the so-called "joint defense" matters, it is not only "joint anti-communism" but also cooperation in maintaining common security. The new term "common security" is an annotation for turning the entire China into a Japanese military garrison area and a justification for stationing troops anywhere in China.

(VIII) Then, speaking of "anti-communism," the true intentions are revealed. Troops must be stationed in key locations in North China and Mongolia. Then, an anti-communist military alliance must be formed. Then, China must recognize that Chinese warships and units can be stationed for long periods in specific locations along the Yangtze River and on islands in South China. Because these locations are too far from Japan's hypothetical enemy, the Soviet Union, and cannot be applied to the term "anti-communism," the above text creates the phrase "maintenance of common security" to apply it. Moreover, Japan retains military "rights of request" and "rights of supervision" over the railways, aviation, communications, major ports, and waterways in the garrison areas. As for the deployment of Chinese domestic military and police and military facilities, it must be limited to a minimum. Furthermore, the construction of this minimal military and police force must be carried out with the cooperation of advisors dispatched by Japan. What is cooperation? Simply surveillance and control.

(IX) Let's look at the content of the so-called economic cooperation. First, there must be mutual assistance and linkage; second, there must be "economic integration," completely plundering China's economy. Even China's financial and economic policies, as well as the establishment of tariffs and customs systems, must be subject to its control, restriction, and regulation.

(X) Regarding resource development, tariff transactions, aviation, transportation, communications, and meteorological surveys, agreements must be concluded based on the principles of facilitating Japanese assistance and cooperation and material supply and demand.

(XI) Japan will be granted special convenience in resource development and utilization in North China and Inner Mongolia. In other regions, Japan will also be granted the necessary convenience regarding specific resources. The focus of the so-called nationwide transportation cooperation includes all of China's aviation, the railways of North China (including the Longhai Railway), maritime transport between China and Japan and along the Chinese coast, Yangtze River shipping, and communications between North China and the lower reaches of the Yangtze River.

All of the above is what Japan wants to encompass all of China, so that even our compatriots' food, clothing, housing, and transportation will be subject to Japanese control, with no room for freedom. Fearing that they had not listed everything completely, in the remarks column, they further stipulated that close consultation with the Japanese side was required, as a justification for demanding anything at any time. Besides this, there were also regulations regarding the relationship between the puppet central government and the three puppet organizations in Nanjing, North China, and Mengjiang. The content was very detailed, but the main spirit was nothing more than cutting them apart piece by piece for them to devour.

Most noteworthy is that Xiamen and Hainan Island are specifically listed as separate articles. Xiamen is to be established as a special administrative region, and Japan's special status on "Hainan Island" must be recognized, giving it the right to handle aviation, communications, maritime transport, and national defense (necessary resource development and utilization matters). Isn't this simply saying that Xiamen and Hainan Island should be permanently ceded to Japan? What is not explicitly mentioned are the so-called specific islands along the South China coast. We must pay attention to this because this is Japan's determination to stir up storms in the Pacific, and to use the resources of our sacred territory and the flesh and blood of the descendants of the Yellow Emperor as capital for its adventurous southward and northward advances.

Looking at this secret agreement, it is many times more extensive and vicious than the Twenty-One Demands that Japan presented to Yuan Shikai in 1915. If these conditions are put into practice, China will fall into eternal ruin, and the 450 million descendants of the Yellow Emperor will truly have no survivors. The disaster for East Asia and the world is even more unfathomable. Yet Wang Zhaoming hurriedly and happily signed it on the last day of the lunar year (December 30th). In this secret agreement, I ask all compatriots, is this peace, or "adjustment of national relations," or conditions for national subjugation? Can China's independence and freedom be guaranteed by the implementation of these conditions, or will they be completely forfeited forever?

What is especially infuriating is that I ask all compatriots to take another look at a document that Wang Zhaoming presented to the Japanese, entitled "Matters Urgently Hoped for from the Japanese Side Before the Establishment of the New Government." What are the "necessary conditions for the establishment of the central government" that he considered? He believed that territorial sovereignty, administration, etc., which are matters of life and death for the nation and the people, could all be ignored. What he contested was a loan of 40 million yuan, as well as the deposit of tariffs, and the transfer of consolidated taxes and salt taxes. To put it plainly, Wang Zhaoming's request to the Japanese was that with money, he would not contest anything at all. In addition, what he requested was the opening of a section of the Yangtze River between Nanjing and Shanghai, and secondarily, the issue of travel permits and constitutional police inspection rights between Beijing and Shanghai, believing that these few items could guarantee his personal safety. His request for the opening of the Yangtze River was not to deceive the Western powers, and his request for travel permits and constitutional police rights had no other purpose. In reality, it was in preparation for escaping by sea or land when things got out of hand.

Therefore, apart from these, he could not contest anything at all, only for these two points he must humbly request the Japanese, even praising them as "changing the people's perceptions and improving the people's psychology." Look at how he treats our compatriots. But how did the Japanese side respond to him? The Japanese side's final response was very simple: the 40 million yuan could only be used when the principles of the new relationship between Japan and China and other transitional measures were confirmed, and they were prepared to find ways to fulfill his wishes. As for tariff revenue, it would still be deposited in the Yokohama Specie Bank, and the portions in North China and Inner Mongolia would still be reserved. The opening of the Yangtze River was rejected. Regarding travel permits and constitutional police inspections, it would have to wait for the actual situation on the ground, such as the suitability for peaceful conditions, and would be determined by the Japanese and Chinese sides through appropriate consultation. We must pay attention to the Japanese saying "upon confirmation." This means that the Japanese wanted Wang to sign the "Essentials of Adjusting the New Relationship between Japan and China" to give him a guarantee that he would never regret it, before paying him the 40 million yuan. From this, we can know the reason why Wang made a full promise on December 30. From this, we can know the inside story of why certain newspapers in Shanghai were anxious and agitated in November and December, putting on a show.

Just looking at these few documents, there is no need for me to elaborate further. I am only reminding the very few compatriots who are too honest and who judge others by their own standards and are inevitably confused by Wang's past smokescreens. After reading these few documents revealed from his own inside story, I ask, what are your thoughts?

Over the past year, the Japanese cabinet has changed from Konoe to Hiranuma, from Hiranuma to Abe, and from Abe to Yonai, escaping the control of the young officers. Now, the new Japanese cabinet has taken the stage. Yonai's first statement was to assist in the creation of the "New Central Government," but the first error was to ask "the entire country to unite to establish a new order in East Asia." This shows that there is disagreement between the Japanese political circles and the people, and that there are still many clear-headed individuals within Japan who know that this attempt to destroy another country will inevitably lead Japan to destruction. No matter how the young military cliques deceive those above and below, they cannot hide the contradictions and disagreements within Japan. But this disagreement is not about the success or failure of the puppet regime. I determined months ago that a puppet organization would appear sooner or later. I also said, "No matter how many puppet organizations the enemy creates, no matter what name these puppet organizations borrow, we only regard them as Japanese slaves. Their internal and external actions will not have the slightest effect, nor will they harm our party or country in the slightest."

Today, we are resisting Japan first. 450 million compatriots are determined to guarantee the independent survival of the Republic of China. No force, no conspiracy, can ever destroy our China. However, the disclosure of Wang's documents this time is of important significance. If it were not for someone inside him acting on their conscience to make this secret agreement public, I can determine that no matter how the Japanese and puppets try to cover up all or at least part of it, Wang would continue to deceive our honest compatriots with flowery words. Now, when this secret agreement was delivered, when it was signed, when it was brought back to Tokyo, and how the Japanese magnates threatened him, it is all very clear. Even if Wang and the Japanese magnates want to deny it, they have no way to deny it. Even if they want to alter and conceal it, let's see how they can alter and conceal it.

### The Process of Wang's Secret Agreement with the Japanese is Announced by Tao Xisheng in Hong Kong

Hong Kong: Tao Xisheng announced on the 22nd an article on the conditions of Japan for the so-called new regime, stating roughly that on October 3rd of last year, Zhou Fohai, Mei Shiping, and I, under Wang's orders, went to the Sanliu Garden. Yingzuo presented the principles and attachments of the so-called new relationship between China and Japan. When he presented it, he said that this was the full hope of the Japanese side, hoping that everyone would discuss it frankly. On November 5th, Wang proposed a cadre meeting, which, in addition to the above three people, included Gao Zongwu, Chen Chunchan, and Lin Baisheng. From this, negotiations continued for about two weeks. Because the issues of anti-communist troop deployments on the North China Railway and Shanghai could not be resolved for a time, they were suspended. On the 18th, Inukai and Zhou Fohai secretly contacted each other, and as a result, negotiations were reopened, and both sides signed. The meeting on the results of the negotiations was attended by Chen Gongbo, Zhou Fohai, Mei Shiping, Lin Baisheng, and myself. Chen Gongbo left Shanghai on the 28th, unwilling to end this negotiation. I decided not to attend. When the conditions first came into our hands, Wang and his wife were very disappointed and worried. At that time, they invited me and Gao Zongwu to secretly discuss methods to stop the formation of the government. Later, the Japanese side and Wang's internal factions echoed each other, and under pressure from both sides, the negotiations were hastily concluded, and they decided to move forward with the formation of the government. At this time, I believed that if I did not escape, I would have to sign the secret agreement on the one hand, and lose my life in Shanghai on the other. On December 28th, I planned a method to go to Shanghai, and on January 3rd, Gao Zongwu and I went to Hong Kong together. Before September of last year, Wang's negotiations with Japan were all presided over by Gao Zongwu. Because the Japanese side found Gao Zongwu's attitude to be stern, they changed to negotiating with Zhou Fohai, who was willing to give in to the end. Although Gao Zongwu told Wang everything he knew, he deeply knew that the situation was over and could not be reversed, so he decided to escape. Whether China and Japan can achieve peace and end the war depends purely on whether China can obtain sovereign independence and administrative integrity. If not, of course, it cannot be (peace), and if it cannot be (peace), there is of course no need to force it. Look at the conditions proposed by the Japanese side. Is there sincerity and determination to respect China's sovereign independence and administrative integrity? Is there any room left for China's sovereignty and the people's livelihood? This cannot be contested with words. After we arrived in Hong Kong, we telegraphed Wang and his cadres with this intention, asking them to consider it. My younger brother and others have advocated peace for three years, and this ambition has not changed. We sincerely hope that it will succeed, and we do not want it to fail. The reason for our retirement is that we have seen that the conditions are unacceptable and that the formation of the government is not worth trying. If we think that this can still be called peace, and that this can still be used to build the country, it is truly chilling. For the sake of our country, why insert our newly loved comrades into the established situation of the "Reformed Government" and boast of an independent and autonomous "New Regime"? This kind of regime has no meaning except to sign conditions for national subjugation. Since it is a fact, it cannot be contested with words. What I hope is that my public and comrades, in the midst of indignation, will reconsider it and not treat love as hate for the public. We left without saying goodbye because we were saddened by the speed of the signing and deeply knew that saying goodbye would not allow us to leave. That is why we said this. The reply telegram only blamed us for leaving and did not mention the issue of forming the "government." Our final advice was clearly ineffective, so we published the original text of the conditions proposed by the Japanese side, seeking public judgment and awakening from the people. If you ask what region the conditions contain, I can answer that it ranges from Heilongjiang to Hainan Island. If you ask what things the conditions contain, I can answer that it ranges from minerals to meteorology, from rivers to territorial waters. On the mainland, it extends from the southeast to the northwest. All of this is held or controlled by Japan without omission. To describe a few key points in the conditions, it is certain that national sovereignty will be lost without a doubt. Everyone can see that under these conditions, China only has one way out: death. Such conditions are still gladly accepted by some people, and the speed and ease with which they are accepted sometimes surprises the Japanese who participated in the negotiations. Those with knowledge on the Japanese side have long seen that their acceptance cannot represent the Chinese people. Of course, even if someone signs these conditions, in the eyes of the Chinese people, it is still a piece of waste paper. Our ancestors sigh in their graves, and our descendants have already lost their freedom in the womb. Are you willing to organize a "government" to implement this? If Japan wants to end the war and achieve peace, it can only cross out these conditions, both in word and in spirit. If Wang and his cadres want to end the war and achieve peace, they can only cross out these conditions and all activities based on these conditions, and wait for the Japanese to become more enlightened.

### British-Soviet Relations: Chamberlain Answers Member's Question

London: At today's meeting of the House of Commons, a member asked if the government intended to sever diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. Prime Minister Chamberlain immediately replied that this issue must be carefully considered from various perspectives and that a satisfactory and accurate answer could not be obtained in a hasty manner.

### The US Government Firmly Refuses to Negotiate a Temporary Trade Agreement with Japan; The Overall Future of US-Japan Trade Relations Depends on the Evolution of the Situation in the Far East; Assistant Secretary of State Hull's Statement to Horinouchi

Washington: Japanese Ambassador Horinouchi held talks with Assistant Secretary of State Hull today for a long time, and Hull answered all the questions he raised. Horinouchi first asked whether the US government was prepared to raise import tariffs and ship taxes on Japanese goods after the current US-Japan trade agreement expires on the 26th of this month. Hull replied that the evolution of trade relations between the two countries would henceforth depend entirely on Japan's attitude towards Americans in China. Horinouchi then asked if the two sides could exchange notes to confirm the future trade relations between the two countries. Hull replied that this matter should be left for consideration and that US Ambassador to Japan Grew might discuss this when he holds talks with Japanese Foreign Ministry officials. Horinouchi then asked whether the legal status of Japanese merchants in the United States would change in the future. Hull replied that after the trade agreement expires, the US government would temporarily treat Japanese merchants as foreign tourists. Ambassador Horinouchi also told the press afterward, "It is hoped that after the expiration of this agreement, normal trade relations between the US and Japan can still be maintained." He said that his government has indeed issued an order stipulating that US goods imported into his country will still be taxed at the original rates, pending further orders. Political figures here commented that if Japan's attitude towards American interests and the interests of the other signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty in Washington does not change, the US will immediately implement economic sanctions. Judging from Ambassador Horinouchi's visit to Hull today, it can be seen that Japan is eager to please the US and will avoid any action that may cause the US to take retaliatory measures after the trade agreement expires. (Havas Telegraph from the 23rd)

Washington: Assistant Secretary of State Hull told Japanese Ambassador to the US Horinouchi yesterday in a half-hour conversation that the termination of the trade agreement in itself does not imply that import tariffs and ship taxes will be changed, but that future trade relations depend on the development of the Far East. The Japanese proposal to exchange diplomatic notes explaining the status of trade relations between the two countries cannot be accepted for the time being. (Reuters Telegraph from the 24th)

Washington: The US government yesterday firmly rejected Japan's proposal to negotiate a new trade agreement to replace the US-Japan trade agreement of 1911, which expires on Friday. The US government announced the abrogation of the US-Japan trade agreement on July 26th of last year to retaliate against Japan's infringement of American rights and interests in the Far East and attacks on American nationals. State Department officials clearly declared to Japanese Ambassador to the US Kensuke Horinouchi yesterday that the US government would not negotiate a temporary agreement with Japan to replace the expiring trade agreement. State Department officials informed the Japanese ambassador that there would be no changes in tariffs and other matters stipulated by the current treaty after the trade agreement expires, but advised the Japanese side that the overall future of US-Japan trade relations will depend on the evolution of the situation in the Far East. The purpose of the State Department is obviously to keep Japan in "good behavior" for the time being in order to determine Japan's future policy towards American interests in the established East and whether to impose an embargo on Japan or conclude a new trade agreement with it. Ambassador Horinouchi visited the State Department yesterday to inquire about expectations after the expiration of the US-Japan trade agreement. He had scheduled a meeting with Secretary of State Hull at 11 o'clock, but Hull was newly suffering from a cold and resting at home and could not meet with him. Ambassador Horinouchi then met with Assistant Secretary of State Hull for half an hour. During State Department Assistant Welles's vacation, Hull is the senior official of the State Department. Horinouchi clearly inquired whether there would be changes in import tariffs on Japanese goods and tonnage taxes on Japanese ships after the expiration of the US-Japan trade agreement and whether the two countries could exchange notes to stipulate temporary trade relations. Hull replied that there would be no changes in import tariffs and tonnage taxes after the expiration of the US-Japan trade agreement. Hull stated in answering the same nature of questions that the US has repeatedly declared that relations between the US and Japan will depend on the evolution of the situation. Hull also told Horinouchi that the issue of exchanging notes between the two countries would be discussed and may be a part of the Tokyo talks. Hull also told Horinouchi that the US government has now decided that foreign nationals cannot obtain the status of "treaty merchant" without the provisions of a trade agreement, but may be temporarily allowed to enter the country for business and travel according to the Immigration Act of 1924. During the period without a trade agreement, it is generally expected that Japanese people requesting to enter the US will be handled in accordance with the current laws and regulations for issuing temporary tourist passports. It is believed that these regulations will guarantee the right of Japanese "treaty merchants" to engage in business in the US, but they must apply to the authorities for the issuance of a temporary tourist permit and must apply once every month.

After meeting with Hull, Kensuke Horinouchi told reporters that he hoped that US-Japan relations after the expiration of the trade agreement would be the same as before. He learned that Tokyo would soon issue a decree announcing that Japan's import tariffs on the US would still be treated the same as other countries. Horinouchi also said that he hoped that US Ambassador to Japan Grew and Japanese Foreign Minister Hachiro Arita would hold another meeting, but he also said that he did not know when the negotiations would begin. State Department officials refused to immediately criticize Horinouchi's visit to the State Department, but State Department officials met immediately after Horinouchi left, mostly to discuss the matter of issuing a statement to reporters. (United Press Telegraph from the 24th)

New York: The US-Japan trade agreement is scheduled to expire on the 26th of this month. The morning newspapers here recently commented on this matter and expressed their approval of the firm attitude taken by the US government, saying that as long as Japan's attitude towards the interests and the Nine-Power Treaty that the US maintains in China does not change, the US does not intend to renew the trade agreement with it. (Havas Telegraph from the 24th)

Washington: Republican Senator Wiley told the Senate yesterday that any action to implement a ban on the export of munitions and raw materials to Japan may cause Japan to formally declare war on China, lock down Chinese ports, and expel foreigners from Japanese-occupied areas. Wiley suggested that "before we discuss US aid to China and the allied countries providing aid to China," the Senate should consider "other proposals that Japan wishes to make." Wiley also said that "the US and Japan can hold a round table conference to discuss trade relations between the two countries, as well as immigration restrictions, arms reduction, and economic assistance." He also advocated signing a new trade agreement to replace the US-Japan trade agreement of 1911, which expires on Friday. (United Press Telegraph from the 24th)

Washington: President Roosevelt refused to comment on the abrogation of the US-Japan trade agreement at his press conference yesterday. (United Press Telegraph from the 24th)

Washington: The US Senate Foreign Relations Committee is scheduled to hear a report from US Secretary of State Hull and other government officials on US-Japan relations on July 31st. At the same time, the Senate will also consider Senators Pittman and White's embargo proposals. According to general opinion, the two senators' proposals will be temporarily shelved in the Foreign Relations Committee pending the outcome of the negotiations between US Ambassador Grew and the Japanese side in Tokyo, and then further consideration will be given.

### Japanese Ship Ryuta Maru Again Inspected by British Warship; Japan Lodges Another Protest Regarding the Asama Maru Incident; British Government Unwilling to Concede to Japan

Honolulu: According to a wireless message received here, today (the 23rd), a destroyer near the coast of Honolulu ordered the Japanese mail ship Ryuta Maru to stop, inquired about its name and destination, and searched the interior of the ship. Although the captain of the Ryuta Maru questioned the nationality and name of the destroyer, the warship did not answer at all. Furthermore, although five German passengers on the Ryuta Maru were safe, two of them voluntarily declared their willingness to disembark in Honolulu. The Ryuta Maru is scheduled to enter Honolulu Harbor at 2:00 PM today (7:30 PM on the 24th according to Japanese time). (Allied Press, 23rd)

Tokyo: Japanese Foreign Minister Arita met with Yamada, the Second Section Chief of the Western European and Asian Affairs Bureau, at his official residence at 9:00 PM on the 23rd to discuss countermeasures for the Asama Maru incident. As a result, they decided to reiterate Japan's views and determination to the British government. Subsequently, at 9:30 PM, he again invited the British Ambassador Craigie for a meeting. During the thirty-minute meeting, he lodged the same strong protest as the firm reservation of the right to demand the extradition of the Germans that Vice Foreign Minister Tani had made to the British government last night. Moreover, a severe warning was issued to Japanese ships such as the Rakuyo Maru, Ginyo Maru, and Ryuta Maru, which are currently returning home across the Pacific, that the serious incident of the Asama Maru should not be repeated. (Allied Press, 24th)

Tokyo: Regarding the British Navy's detention of twenty-one Germans on the Asama Maru, Vice Foreign Minister Tani lodged a protest with the British Ambassador Craigie on the 22nd, stating, "If it is determined that the detained Germans are non-active-duty military personnel, then the right to demand their immediate extradition to the government must be reserved." Furthermore, Vice Foreign Minister Tani explained that the Japanese Navy believed that the detention of the Germans was a unilateral interpretation of international law by the British government, which was vastly different from the Japanese government's view. He said that at this juncture, considering the political complications, it would be appropriate to voluntarily extradite the detained Germans to the Japanese side, urging the British side to give it serious consideration. He also said that if the British government insisted on its theory and did not immediately extradite the Germans, the Imperial government would formally demand their extradition based on its reserved rights. Therefore, the Japanese government is currently awaiting a substantial response to the protest of the 22nd and a voluntary extradition from the British side. Regarding this point, if the British side's handling is unsatisfactory, then preparations will be made for all formal extradition procedures, and the British side's attitude is being closely monitored. (Allied Press, 24th)

Tokyo: The Asahi Shimbun reports that Japan has notified Britain that Japan has already taken "effective and appropriate self-defense measures" for its ships returning across the Pacific. This point was notified by Japanese Foreign Minister Arita to British Ambassador Sir Robert Craigie last night. Arita, with a "stern attitude," told the British ambassador that if another "unfortunate incident" were to occur, the great shock felt by the Japanese government and public would have the most serious consequences for British-Japanese relations. (Reuters, 24th)

Tokyo: The Foreign Ministry spokesman stated to newspaper reporters this morning that the Japanese people view the incident of the Asama Maru being intercepted and searched by a British cruiser with hatred, and the result has been an automatic outburst of national sentiment throughout Japan. Because the incident occurred practically in the shadow of sacred Mount Fuji, the Foreign Ministry is still awaiting the British government's fullest explanation. At the same time, Japan reserves the right to demand the return of the twenty-one Germans who were captured, because we cannot accept the broad definition of its rights given by Britain. The spokesman refused to discuss whether the German order of June 22, 1938, which effectively listed all Germans of military age as soldiers, was accurate, saying that he adhered to the Japanese side's opinion. (Reuters, 24th)

Tokyo: In order to thoroughly inform the nation of the truth of the Asama Maru incident, the Japanese government specially invited fifty members of the House of Representatives, including the Speaker and Vice Speaker, and representatives from various factions, to the Prime Minister's official residence at 1:30 PM today. From the government side, Prime Minister Yonai and Foreign Minister Arita attended to explain in detail the facts investigated by the Foreign Ministry and the government's countermeasures, based on the report of Captain Watanabe of the Asama Maru, and to seek their understanding. Furthermore, starting at 3:00 PM, fifty representatives from various factions of the House of Peers were invited for further explanation. It was also decided to invite executives from major newspapers and news agencies in Tokyo at 5:00 PM for the same explanation. (Allied Press, 24th)

Tokyo: In order to discuss measures to deal with the aftermath of the Asama Maru incident and to prevent illegal and forceful actions by the British Navy, the Japanese government authorities continued to hold a meeting of relevant officials at the Foreign Ministry at 11:00 AM today. From the Foreign Ministry, Yamada, the Second Section Chief of the European and Asian Affairs Bureau, and Matsudaira, the Second Section Chief of the Treaty Bureau, attended. From the Navy, Lieutenant Commander Shiba of the Military Affairs Bureau attended. From the Army, Lieutenant Colonel Takayama of the Military Affairs Bureau attended. From the Ministry of Communications, official Kimura of the Ship Administration Bureau attended. First, the Foreign Ministry reported that, according to information from the British side, the British government views the Asama Maru issue as merely a minor dispute arising from different interpretations of international law. Therefore, it does not seem to attach importance to the future of the case. The British government's attitude reveals a significant lack of understanding of the feelings of the Japanese people. Therefore, Foreign Minister Arita invited Ambassador Craigie last night (23rd) to explain the seriousness of the situation and urged him to prompt the British government to give it deep consideration. Next, based on the information that the mail ship Ryuta Maru, which departed from San Francisco on the 18th, was inspected by a foreign warship off the coast of Honolulu, measures to deal with the incident and future countermeasures were discussed. (Allied Press, 24th)

Tokyo: Officials from the Foreign Ministry and the Navy Ministry held a joint meeting this morning to discuss the measures that Japan would take regarding the British Navy's activities in the Pacific and the rumored interception and search of the Ryuta Maru by a British destroyer, and exchanged opinions. According to semi-official sources, an official from the Foreign Ministry pointed out, "British people do not seem to hold a serious view of the Asama Maru incident, which shows that Britain has not noticed the national sentiment of Japan. Therefore, Foreign Minister Arita invited British Ambassador Sir Robert Craigie to the Foreign Ministry last night to urge the British Ambassador to pay attention to the seriousness of this incident." (Reuters, 24th)

London: According to news released here today, the British warship's capture of the twenty-one Germans aboard the Japanese ship Asama Maru is a common practice in wartime, permitted by international law, and was done during the last Great War. The purpose is to prevent individuals who have a special relationship to the conduct of the war from returning to the enemy country. Several belligerent countries have already taken the same action in the current war and have not caused any objections. The Allied countries have always strived to show the greatest courtesy to neutral countries and reduce their inconvenience. The remarks made by the German ambassador to Japan, Wirth, can be refuted by the fact that on September 24 of last year, a German warship intercepted the Swedish merchant ship Magareta off the coast of Sweden and captured the British fishermen on board. According to the German order issued on June 22, 1938, all Germans of military age are obligated to enter military service or receive special training. Now, Germans are traveling in groups, avoiding the Atlantic route and taking the longer Pacific route, attempting to escape arrest. It should be known that it is necessary to arrest technicians who can be used in submarine warfare. For the sake of Britain and neutral countries, submarine warfare should be stopped. (Reuters, 24th)

London: Regarding the "Asama Maru" case involving a Japanese mail ship, official sources here stated that the Japanese Foreign Ministry had met again with British Ambassador Craigie last night to inform him that the Japanese government considered the nature of the case to be extremely serious. The British government is carefully studying this issue. It is reported that when the Foreign Office issues a response in the next few days, it will try its best to explain that this matter is very ordinary, because during the last European war, the Allied countries, including Japan, intercepted a total of sixty-four neutral country ships and captured 350 people from certain European countries. This shows that the actions of the British warship intercepting the "Asama Maru" did not violate international law. In addition, German warships recently captured British and Polish fishermen from neutral country ships on the high seas, further proving that it is a common action. (Havas, 24th)

Demonstration Held by Tokyo Citizens

Tokyo: Members of the Yamato Society planned to stage a demonstration in front of the British Embassy yesterday afternoon over the Asama Maru incident. The gates of the British Embassy were immediately closed, and additional police were deployed for security. When the Yamato Society held a public rally, it decided to take demonstration action, but it was blocked by the police. The demonstrators were led into a nearby shrine, but were allowed to send two representatives into the British Embassy to read a lengthy statement to the Second Secretary, accusing Britain of defiling Japan's honor and prestige and demanding an apology from the British government. Today, several small groups of active demonstrators stood outside the British Embassy all day. Delegations from the Tokyo City Council, the Japan Youth Association, and the Yamato Society were received by Second Secretary Sabridge and presented a petition demanding that Britain (1) return the twenty-one Germans captured from the Asama Maru, (2) express regret, and (3) guarantee that such incidents will not occur again in the future. At 5:20 PM, the demonstrators gradually dispersed, and the police stationed at the British Embassy also withdrew. (Reuters, 24th)

Tokyo: The Miyako Shimbun today published a commentary suggesting that the Japanese Navy detain all American ships in Japanese and Chinese waters and arrest adult British people in retaliation for the British action in the "Asama Maru" incident. In addition, goods found on British ships that are destined for the Chongqing government should be confiscated. At the same time, the "Kokumin Shimbun" and "Hochi Shimbun" continue to incite anti-British movements. (United Press, 24th)

### Another British Destroyer Sunk; Over a Hundred Crew Members Killed; This is the Sixth Since the Start of the War; Four British, Greek, and Norwegian Merchant Ships Sunk by Mines in British Waters

London: Another British destroyer has been sunk by a mine or torpedo. The ship is the "Exmouth," the leader of the Fifth Destroyer Flotilla of the Home Fleet, weighing 1,475 tons and equipped with five 4.7-inch guns, commanded by Captain Ponssen. According to an announcement by the Admiralty, none of the 175 crew members survived. British Commander Captain Ponssen commanded the Eighth Destroyer Flotilla of the British Fleet in China from 1937 to 1938. (Reuters, 24th)

London: Since the start of the war, the British Navy has lost a total of five destroyers. The other four are the "Duchess," displacing 1,690 tons, with 120 officers and men killed; the "Gypsy," displacing 2,345 tons, with 31 officers and men killed; the "Blanche," displacing 1,360 tons, with 2 officers and men killed; and the "Grenville" (sunk in the North Sea on the 20th of this month), displacing 1,485 tons, with 8 officers and men killed and 75 injured. (Havas, 24th)

London: The British ship "Baltanglia" (1,523 tons) and the Norwegian ship "Prato" (1,598 tons) successively struck mines and sank in the northeastern waters of Britain today. All crew members have been rescued and have landed in Britain. (Havas, 23rd)

Oslo: The Norwegian ship "Seatford," weighing 4,000 tons, sank yesterday in Scottish waters. It has not yet been determined whether it struck a mine or was hit by a torpedo. Nineteen of the 24 crew members were rescued by another Norwegian ship, while the other five are missing. (Reuters, 24th)

Lisbon: The Greek ship "Tricolis" was sunk by a torpedo yesterday 50 miles outside Estoril. Ten people on board were rescued by a Spanish ship and have landed in Paniche, and several injured people have been sent to the hospital for treatment. (Reuters, 24th)

### Distress Situation of Italian Ship in the Mediterranean; One Hundred and Seven People Killed

Genoa: The Italian mail ship "Orazio" was burned in the Mediterranean on Sunday. According to the latest announcement by the Italian shipping company, a total of 107 people were killed, including 47 passengers and 60 crew members. The remaining 318 people were rescued by the Italian ship "Conte Biancamano," and 173 people were rescued by the "Columbus." When these people landed, they described the events, saying that the "Orazio" sent out a distress signal and the "Conte Biancamano" did not arrive for ten hours. A Danish woman named Lai Sen, who arrived in Genoa wearing silk pajamas, told people that she was awakened by a noise at 4:00 AM on Sunday and rushed to the deck, where she saw the crew struggling to put out the fire. Before long, the ship's engine stopped, all the lights went out, and after the alarm sounded, passengers rushed to the deck. Fortunately, the efforts of the crew calmed the chaos. At the time, the middle of the ship was on fire, and the passengers were mostly gathered at the front of the ship, with thick smoke swirling around, making it difficult to breathe and impossible to open their eyes. Her door and legs were burned. The situation when people went down to the small boat was particularly tragic, because the bridge and the side of the ship were already hot and difficult to approach, and the sea was turbulent, so there was a risk of the lifeboats crashing into the ship's hull. She saw several men jump into the sea. Another woman named Frailo had been in distress on the Dutch ship "Simon Bolivar," which was sunk by a mine. This time, she was rescued again with her husband and young daughter. Three English women on board were also rescued. Those who escaped expressed their gratitude to the French, who turned on searchlights and carried out rescue work at the scene of the incident. (Reuters, 24th)

### U.S. Navy Shipbuilding Program; Three Years Reduced to Two Years; Mr. Vinson's Proposal

Washington: Mr. Vinson, Chairman of the U.S. House Naval Affairs Committee, yesterday asked the Navy Department to submit a two-year naval shipbuilding program to replace the three-year program. This move has the potential to reduce the $1.3 billion fleet expansion program. Vinson said that if a two-year program is established, fewer cruisers and submarines can be built, but aircraft carriers and submarines still need to be specified, and three aircraft carriers still need to be specified. According to Vinson's proposal on January 18 to reduce the original appropriation of $500 million, it would be unwise to pre-pile many shipbuilding projects that cannot be started in time. If Vinson's proposal is adopted, the originally planned total of 4 million tons will be reduced to 2.18 million tons. (Reuters, 24th)

### The Issue of the American Security Zone; France Submits a Reply; Must Guarantee That German Warships Do Not Enter the Zone; Otherwise, France Should Enjoy the Rights of a Belligerent

Paris: Regarding the issue of the security zone along the American continent, after the Panamanian government sent a note to France on December 23 of last year on behalf of the twenty-one American republics, the French government has submitted a reply, stating that in order for this security zone to be effectively implemented, the governments of the American countries should provide guarantees to ensure that Germany does not send warships or supply ships into the zone, which is a necessary step. However, given the current situation, the governments of the American countries do not seem to intend to prevent German warships from engaging in hostile activities in the security zone. Therefore, French warships have the right to prevent or curb such activities in accordance with international law, which the American countries cannot deny. In short, the goal of the American countries should be achieved based on this principle, which is also accepted by the belligerent countries. Before an agreement is reached between the countries concerned, the French government will continue to reserve all the rights of a belligerent in accordance with international law. With regard to the German pocket battleship "Spee," the French ship "Taiwan" was attacked by the ship in the American security zone. Therefore, if the American countries cannot guarantee that German warships will not enter the security zone, it is natural that Britain and France have the right to resist the activities of German warships. In addition, the fact that the British and French fleets maintain an advantage is undeniable. For the sake of self-preservation, German warships will inevitably use the American security zone as a hiding place. If this is the case, the benefits of the British and French advantages of the Navy will be lost. In conclusion, although certain non-belligerent countries may feel inconvenienced by the British and French blockade, the damage caused by Germany's indiscriminate attacks on the ships of neutral countries is insignificant and not worth mentioning. (Havas, 23rd)

### Incident of American Ships Being Inspected; British-American Negotiations; The U.S. Still Expresses Dissatisfaction with the British Response

London: Regarding the memorandum submitted by the U.S. government to the British Ambassador to the U.S. yesterday, which stated that American ships were delayed in the contraband inspection port of Gibraltar more than Italian ships, those in charge in London have recently offered an explanation, saying that this delay was not caused by Britain giving preferential treatment to any one country. Anyone who follows the measures set by the Contraband Management Office, which aims to facilitate inspection, can be quickly released. The measures set by the Management Office include: (1) Not unloading suspected goods, meaning that the shipowner is responsible for ensuring that the goods cannot be unloaded if the authorities do not approve of the destination of the goods. (2) Naval permits, which are documents that report the type of goods and the destination in advance. Italian ships report various details in advance, and their cooperation with the British side seems to be better than that of American ships. The British authorities often do not receive information about many American goods, and have not received any prior reports since Christmas. However, the American ship "Washington," which arrived at the port of Gibraltar on Sunday, did not report in advance, but its agent was able to provide a list of goods and give the necessary guarantees. Therefore, the ship was released within 12 hours. Another reason why American ships are often delayed is that American ships mostly carry miscellaneous goods, sometimes as many as 300 kinds, and the inspection takes a lot of time. Italian ships are different, and they mostly carry whole shipments of goods such as oil or grain, so the inspection procedures are simple and release is faster. (Reuters, 24th)

Washington: Upon hearing the British statement that Italian ships seem more willing to cooperate with Britain than American ships, U.S. State Department officials said that the cooperation between American shipping companies and the British Contraband Management Office is astonishing, in order to avoid unpleasant events. Such as American shipping companies applying to the British authorities for naval permits, presenting copies of the ship's cargo list by airmail, and providing guarantees that suspected goods will not be unloaded, are all evidence of the cooperation of American shipping companies. However, American ships are not obligated to cooperate with Britain, so any failure to cooperate cannot be a reason for unduly delaying American ships. (Reuters, 24th)

### Polish Nation Vows to Fight for Independence; Confident That the Motherland Will Be Liberated One Day; Non-Recognition of Situations Created by Violence

Paris: The Polish National Committee, which is an advisory body to the country's President Raczkiewicz, held its first meeting at the Polish Embassy in France yesterday. First, the President's message was read out, expressing the hope that Poland would be able to live and work in peace in the future. Subsequently, General Sikorski, the Prime Minister of the Sikorski Cabinet, gave a speech stating that the current Polish government should establish a strong foundation for a true, fair, disciplined, and democratic system. Our army is being reorganized and will be a strong and powerful tool for liberating the motherland. Former Prime Minister and piano virtuoso Paderewski spoke next, saying, "Poland's national destiny will never be extinguished, and we must liberate it. The army of our country's reconstruction should strive for freedom for the oppressed compatriots. In short, we should take the misfortunes experienced by the motherland as a lesson, and establish a political system in which democracy can coexist with a stable and strong government." The Polish National Committee then passed several motions, declaring Poland's determination to fight for independence. The Allied countries of Britain and France are also fighting for justice, and Poland should be loyal to them. Pope Pius XII recently issued an encyclical expressing sympathy to Poland. The neighboring countries have been enthusiastic in protecting Polish refugees, which is deeply appreciated. In addition, Finland has also been invaded by the Soviet Union, and it is hoped that the country will defeat them. In conclusion, the decisions taken by the Polish people under violent coercion will not be recognized. Those who commit the crimes of looting and destruction within Poland will be punished according to law. (Havas, 24th)

### Speech by Former Polish Prime Minister; Listeners Greatly Moved

Paris: The first meeting of the Polish Provisional Parliament was held yesterday at the Polish Embassy here. Paderewski, the world-renowned pianist and first Prime Minister of Poland, who was recently appointed as the chief member of the Polish Parliament, attended and delivered a speech. Although Paderewski is old and physically weak, he still has the ability to move listeners. He said, "Poland is not dead. We will rescue Poland from the depths of depravity and restore Poland from destruction. Our army, after winning the final victory with the British and French Allied forces, will re-enter our country with flying banners, and restore freedom to our oppressed compatriots with bayonets." Paderewski also said that Poland's destiny was mostly caused by the governments of recent years, and that this kind of tragedy should be taken as a warning in the future. Finally, he said that the spirit of the compatriots who were killed in Poland for righteousness will never die, and Poland will eventually live, prosper, and be glorious forever for you and me and for all mankind. Although Paderewski's pronunciation was slow and weak, the members wanted to burst into tears upon hearing it, and one female member wept softly. (Reuters, 24th)

### Intense Soviet Offensive on the Eastern Finnish Front, Meets Strong Finnish Resistance

Helsinki – The Soviet army has resumed a fierce advance along a fifty-mile front, stretching northeast from Lake Ladoga to the border. The battles in this area are feared to be of extreme severity. According to the current situation, it is unlikely that the Soviet army can break through the Finnish lines. However, if they can break through, they could advance rapidly around Lake Ladoga and seize the Mannerheim Line from the rear. However, the latest Finnish communique states that Finnish forces have repelled the attacking Soviet forces, inflicting heavy damage. The Soviet army is launching dense offensives with the powerful assistance of artillery and tank forces. Judging from the thousands of Soviet casualties mentioned in the Finnish communique, the Soviet offensive is fierce. It is heard that the tactics used by the Finnish army are similar to those used by Hannibal to defeat the Romans in ancient times, that is, retreating when the Soviet army launches dense offensives, and then attacking the flanks of the Soviet army to cut off their lines of communication. The Finnish communique also states that the Finnish army continues to fight northeast of Lake Ladoga, with considerable success. Soviet attacks at all points have been repelled and have suffered heavy losses. In the Battle of Kollandaoki, more than a thousand Soviet soldiers were killed. Soviet fighter planes in the war zone appear most frequently in the Karelian Isthmus north of Lake Ladoga. Finnish aircraft have repelled Soviet aircraft and conducted reconnaissance and photographic flights, as well as acting as artillery fire directors. According to unconfirmed reports, six Soviet aircraft were shot down, and the fate of three others is uncertain. (Reuters Telegram, 24th)

Moscow – According to a communique issued by the headquarters of the Leningrad Military District, on the 23rd, both sides' reconnaissance teams were active in the areas of Lippola and Ukhta. Some infantry units were also active in the Peterzhavsk region. As for the Karelian Isthmus, there was still artillery fire and reconnaissance team activity. The Soviet Air Force conducted inspection flights and engaged in combat with enemy aircraft. (TASS Telegram, 24th)

### After the Disastrous Defeat of the Japanese Army in Northern Guangdong, Chinese Forces are Rapidly Advancing Towards Guangzhou; The North River Advances to Juntian; The East River Recovers Zhengguo; The West River Encircles Sanshui

Shaoguan Correspondence: After the disastrous defeat of the Japanese army, which attempted to invade Shaoguan in northern Guangdong, its main force retreated to Guangzhou, hoping to hold out for reinforcements. On the Chinese side, taking advantage of the Japanese army's confusion, it has mobilized the armies of the East, West, and North Rivers, aiming for Guangzhou and advancing step by step. At present, it is about to reach the outskirts of Guangzhou, and a three-sided encirclement is about to take shape. The battle situation is recorded as follows:

The Chinese army on the North River route is advancing south with irresistible force. On the 10th, it captured Conghua City, annihilating many Japanese soldiers. The majority of the Japanese army collapsed towards Shengong Taipingchang. On the 11th, the Chinese army had completely recovered Conghua City and, together with a route advancing from Jilonggang, surrounded the Japanese army in the area of Guancun Fengyuan. That morning, more than 600 Japanese soldiers stubbornly held on to Jiekou (northeast of Shengong) to cover the retreat of the main force. The Zhao Division of the Chinese army bravely attacked, sparking a bloody battle that lasted all day, capturing dozens of rifles. Another unit of the Chinese army, searching and advancing from Shiken, has advanced to the vicinity of Hemujing. The battle on the outer line of Shengong will become increasingly fierce.

On the Qingyin route, after a fierce battle along the Qingyin line on the 9th, the Chinese side's fresh troops arrived continuously, having defeated the main force of the Japanese army between Longtang and Shijiao. On the evening of the 10th, they approached the western outskirts of Yinzhanao, where the Japanese army stubbornly defended inside fortifications. The Chinese Wang Division artillery intensively bombarded the Japanese positions. In two hours, more than ten Japanese barracks and fortifications were destroyed, killing a hundred Japanese soldiers. A certain regiment took the opportunity to attack, entering the western outskirts. The Japanese army suffered heavy casualties and retreated to a corner. On the morning of the 11th, the Chinese army recovered Guotai, southeast of Shijiao. By noon, the vanguard of the Chinese army had advanced to the western outskirts of Juntian, joining a unit from the Guangdong Road and launching a fierce attack on Juntian. The Japanese army then moved to Songqiaopai (west of Juntian) and Sandousong (southwest of Yinzhanao) to defend firmly.

The Zhang Division, which intercepted the retreating Japanese army from Qingyuan from Lubao to the northeast, fought fiercely with the Japanese army in Chini and Tanbu for several days. The Japanese army in Guanyao and Fengyong, which belong to Nanhai, attempted to provide assistance. On the 12th, they advanced north along the Chantan Highway to Tanbu, under the cover of many tanks, and the two sides re-enacted a bloody battle. On the same day, a certain unit of the Chinese army advanced from Tanbu to Xinjie at 1:00 AM. The Yang Suiliang unit of the Second District team, which was active in the areas of Bicun, Dayibu, and Daling, launched a joint attack, rushing into Xinjie Station and engaging in hand-to-hand combat with the Japanese army. Soon, a large unit of the Japanese army from Xinminbu came to reinforce, and the Chinese army firmly defended the northwest periphery and fought fiercely with the Japanese army.

The Chinese army on the East River Eastern Route, taking advantage of the disastrous defeat of the Japanese army's northern invasion and the emptiness of the rear in Zengcheng and Dongguan, launched a counter-offensive on both the north and south banks to cooperate with the Chinese armies on the Northwest River and complete the overall attack formation on the outskirts of Guangzhou. In the past week, the Chinese army continued to move east through Heyuan. One unit advanced to Longmen to intercept the defeated Japanese army that had invaded the north, one unit advanced along the Luofu Mountain foothills from Boluo to attack Zengcheng, and one unit attacked Shilong from the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway and the Dongjiang River. In addition, a certain elite force cooperated with the teams from the Third and Fourth Districts, mixed into the rear of the Japanese army in Dongguan and Zengcheng, launched guerrilla tactics to assist in the counter-offensive. At present, the battles on all routes have been launched one after another. It has been learned that the Chinese army, which has mixed into the rear of the Japanese army in Zengcheng, has cooperated with the Second District guerrilla team for several days, attacking the Japanese army on the Zengtan and Guangzeng highways. On the evening of the 4th, the Zhao Division plainclothes team cooperated with the Shan Rongpei unit of the guerrilla team and attacked Shitan at night. More than 300 Japanese soldiers were unable to resist. The Chinese army entered the station along the Zengtan Road and set fire to the nearby Japanese barracks. For a time, the flames soared into the sky, and the Japanese army fled in panic. Soon, the Japanese army in Zengpo heard the news and sent a team of hundreds to provide reinforcements. The Chinese army then calmly withdrew. According to reports, the Japanese army in Zengcheng had sent a large part of its force to the Longmen and Xinfeng areas to provide reinforcements. Later, after the Japanese army that invaded the north was defeated, fearing that the Chinese army would launch a large-scale attack on Zengcheng and break through the eastern defense line of Guangzhou, it transferred the Japanese army from Longmen County back to Zengcheng. At present, there are more than 2,000 Japanese soldiers in the four suburbs of Zengcheng. Therefore, on the 4th and 5th, the Japanese army in Dipaidi, Longmen, was defeated by the Huang Regiment of the Chinese army's Lin Division and fled towards Tiegang Zuotan Foziao. When passing near Tiegang, it was ambushed on all sides by the Yun Regiment of the Chinese army's Zhang Brigade. The Japanese army was suddenly encircled and annihilated, scattering in all directions. However, the Chinese army had a tight arrangement and launched a fierce attack, and after three hours of fierce fighting, the Japanese army left behind a lot of corpses and luggage. The Chinese army followed up and attacked, and in the evening, attacked Zuotan Market again, engaging in hand-to-hand combat with the Japanese army. However, due to the threat of Japanese aircraft, it took the initiative to withdraw. On that day, many Japanese soldiers were killed. At present, fierce fighting is still taking place near Zuotan. It has been found that the Japanese armies in Zengcheng and Longmen counties rely entirely on the recently repaired Zenglong Highway for communication and transportation. In order to cut off the Japanese side's communication on this line, the Chinese army has launched raids on the strongholds along the line for several days, with great gains. On the evening of the 6th, the Liu Regiment of the Lin Division also attacked Zhengguo and Xintian in the northeast of Zengcheng and on the border of Zenglong. Because most of the Japanese army had been transferred away from Longmen, the defense was weak and it retreated to a corner. Chinese officers and soldiers often attacked into Zhengguo Market, destroying the Japanese radio station, armory, and command post separately, killing many Japanese soldiers. Soon, Japanese reinforcements arrived and fought back, and the battle became more intense. It was still in a stalemate until the morning of the 7th. At present, the Zenglong Road has been repeatedly damaged, and Japanese transportation is extremely difficult.

In the past week, the Chinese army on the West River West Route, taking advantage of the Japanese army's disastrous defeat in the north, has mobilized separately to launch attacks on the Sanshui, Nanhai, and Jianghui lines to cooperate in completing the offensive on the outer lines of Guangzhou's east, west, and north, and to launch a large-scale sweep of the Japanese army. Therefore, the battles on the front line are becoming increasingly fierce. Among them, the Zhang Division of the Li Group Army, which guarded the outer perimeter of Lubao, was ordered to attack Sanshui. For several days, it crossed the Lubao River and advanced fiercely, sweeping away the Japanese army on the outer perimeter of Sanshui. On the evening of the 7th, the vanguard had advanced to Sanshui City and engaged in fierce battles with the Japanese army in the Jichang and Baisha areas outside the north gate. The Chinese army used the darkness to launch a siege on all sides. After two hours of stalemate, the Japanese army could not hold on and retreated one after another. The Chinese army pursued closely, rushing to Dachi Gang in the near suburbs. The Japanese army initially attempted to resist, but the Chinese artillery team arrived to assist in the attack, and the infantry bravely charged and killed, defeating the Japanese army again. The remaining Japanese army fled into the city in embarrassment, stubbornly defending the city. As soon as a certain unit of the Chinese army arrived, it launched a large-scale attack on the county seat. As for the Lubao West Road, the Japanese army stationed in Xinan Town has recently feared a Chinese counter-offensive and has repeatedly invaded the Yangmei area, pretending to attack in order to defend. A certain unit of the Zhang Division has arrived at Yangmei Yigang and other places to sweep away the Japanese army that is scurrying about. At 1:00 PM on the 6th, it surrounded Zhangbian, south of Yangmei. More than 200 Japanese soldiers were attacked from all sides, suffering heavy casualties. At around 3:00 PM, they could not hold on and broke through to the south, retreating to Xinan Town. The Chinese army followed up with a fierce attack, killing more than half of them and seizing many rifles and other spoils of war. At present, the Chinese army is clearing the remnants and continuing to press Xinan. Therefore, the Japanese army is extremely panicked. On the 7th, more than 400 troops were sent from Foshan to Guantian to provide reinforcements, dividing the defense between Dangui Market and Yuelou in the near suburbs, preparing for a stubborn defense. Also, after the Japanese army suffered a major setback in the northern invasion, the Japanese army in various places in the West River was greatly shaken. In order to suppress military morale and contain the Chinese army's offensive, the Japanese command has held naval and military exercises for several days, taking the opportunity to send warships to spy on the counties of Gao Yao, Sihui, and Gaoming, making a false show of strength. Japanese aircraft also wreaked havoc everywhere. At 9:00 AM on the 6th, four Japanese aircraft took off from the River Mouth seaplane field, flew over Zhaoqing City, and attacked Deqing. Near Yuecheng, they dropped several bombs on civilian ships and strafed them with machine guns, sinking three civilian ships and killing or injuring more than 20 people. At noon on the 7th, two Japanese aircraft flew directly to Sihui Mafang and Dasha Liantang, etc. along the Gao (Yao) Si (Hui) highway to bomb, dropping eleven bombs, destroying more than 30 civilian houses and killing or injuring several people.

### Chinese Guerrillas Attack Jiashan East Gate; The Puppet Self-Defense Corps Makes Prior Compromises

Jiashan Correspondence: On the evening of the 2nd of this month, about two miles outside the East Gate, there was a puppet self-defense corps, which was an intelligence team sent by the Japanese garrison. The Japanese garrison also said to the corps that if the guerrillas came, they would burn the prepared haystacks in the area as a fire signal. Unexpectedly, when the guerrillas advanced that night, they had already reached a compromise with the self-defense corps, so they did not set fire as a signal. Until the guerrillas approached, the Japanese army was caught off guard and had to retreat into the city to defend firmly. After an hour of mutual fire, the guerrilla team retreated. For a time, the residents inside and outside the city were particularly panicked.

### Guilin Province Sets Relief Measures for Students from Fallen Areas; Tuition Fees Waived and Food Expenses Subsidized for Those with Economic Difficulties

(Guilin Correspondence) The Guangxi Provincial Government, considering that students in various secondary schools and above are experiencing great difficulties in supplying funds and are unable to pay tuition and food expenses due to their families being trapped in war zones or affected by the war, has specially issued temporary relief measures and instructed all districts to forward them to their subordinate county governments and all secondary schools and above for compliance. The original measures are as follows: (1) Students whose families are trapped in war zones and have difficulty supplying funds, after verification, will be exempted from tuition fees, and the required food expenses will be fully subsidized by public funds. (2) Students who are not able to receive family assistance due to the war, after verification, will be exempted from tuition fees and may be granted a discretionary loan for food expenses. (3) Students requesting subsidies or loans for food expenses should submit a written application to the school, detailing the reasons. However, those who have already received public funding will not be allowed to apply for subsidies again. (4) Each school should organize a committee to review and decide on the aforementioned requests. (5) All students receiving subsidies or loans for food expenses should issue receipts or IOUs, and the school should prepare a monthly roster along with the receipts and report them separately to the Prefectural Government or County Government for verification and forwarding (private schools should report to the Board of Directors). (6) The food expenses for the aforementioned subsidies and loans will be drawn from the school's surplus funds. If there is a shortfall, the school will apply to the Prefectural Government for additional funding. (7) Students receiving subsidies or loans for food expenses will be discontinued immediately if their families are already providing assistance. The loan amount should be repaid in full.

### Guo Youshou, Director of the Sichuan Education Department, Reports on Education (3)

Elementary school teachers are graded according to qualifications. The monthly salary of the principals of central schools is at least thirty yuan. The monthly salary of the teachers of central schools and the principals of national schools is at least twenty-five yuan. The monthly salary of the teachers of national schools is at least twenty yuan. Those with good qualifications will be increased by grade, and those who are unqualified will be made to study and participate in examinations. At present, the number of qualified elementary school teachers in Sichuan is only one-tenth of the total, totaling more than 4,200 people. It is not difficult to increase the number. Whether this issue can be carried out smoothly still needs to be reviewed and the final decision will be made when each county budgets. Secondly, regarding the improvement of the quality of secondary schools, there are more than 200 public and private secondary schools in Sichuan. Except for Guangdong Province, no other province in the country has more than Sichuan. However, considering the population density of Sichuan Province, it cannot be said to be too many. At present, we plan not to expand the quantity temporarily, and strive to improve the quality. First of all, we will adjust the distribution of each school, and allocate them evenly according to the traffic conditions and population density of each place, dividing Sichuan into ten secondary school districts such as Chengdu, Zizhong, Leshan, and Mianyang. At the same time, a provincial normal school will be set up in each administrative district, and the funds for the jointly established district schools will be changed to be borne by the provincial government. All counties will be changed to provincial. As for the district agricultural and forestry schools, most of them have not been realized in the past. It has been decided to use 200,000 yuan in funding to establish five junior agricultural vocational schools. This plan has been gradually realized. As for the county secondary schools, preparations are also being made to gradually transfer them to the department's administration. Regarding vocational education, it is planned to set up short-term vocational courses in the factories that have moved to Sichuan, and negotiations are being conducted with the factories that have moved to Sichuan. It is hoped that after the technical employees of the factories that have moved to Sichuan return to the east, the province will still have talents to continue to run them. Finally, the private secondary schools in each county feel financially distressed, and we are now looking for ways to subsidize them in order to improve their quality. Thirdly, regarding the widespread establishment of central schools and national schools, this work is scheduled to be completed within three years, achieving one central elementary school per township and one national school per bao. Last time, when I was in Chongqing, I followed the instructions of Minister Chen of the Education Department and formulated nine principles, which were submitted to the acting chairman for approval. Generally, one central school will be set up in each township, which should not be a problem this year. As for the establishment of national schools, it is planned to proceed in stages. From July 29th to June 30th, at least one national school will be established for every two bao. From July 30th to June 32nd, one national school will be established for every bao. Before the implementation of this plan, the two major issues of funding and talent must be resolved first. These issues are currently being discussed in detail. The above is a brief report on several key tasks of this department this year. Finally, I would also like to say a few words about higher education in Sichuan. The subsidy for National Sichuan University is still included in the education and culture expenses. The School of Commerce of Chongqing University has now been formally established, and it is hoped that it will work hard to cultivate specialized talents and develop. The Provincial Education College will train specialized technical personnel for political construction and cultivate talents, according to the province's needs. The Provincial Government subsidizes West China Union University with 10,000 yuan every year, and it is hoped that it will develop more in the fields of dentistry and medicine. In addition, the Provincial Library has been formally established, and the Preparatory Committee for the Preservation of Ancient Artifacts and Literature is also being established. It is hoped that colleagues in the government will not hesitate to point out any mistakes and provide more support. After the speech, Secretary-General He led the reading of the Party Member Code of Conduct, and the meeting adjourned at 11:00 AM.

### Second Hong Kong-Shanghai Interport Football Match: Lido May Face Hong Kong; Difficulties in Forming the Chinese All-Star Team; Change Under Consideration

Interport football matches, according to tradition, apart from the official interport match, the guest team will also play against the host team's Chinese All-Star team and Western All-Star team or Military All-Star team. However, this year there will be an unprecedented attempt, that is, a single club will face the team from afar. According to reports in Hong Kong newspapers, in the Hong Kong-Vietnam (Saigon) interport competition during the Spring Festival, the first match (9th) was Saigon vs. Eastern, and the third match (10th) was Saigon vs. South China. Unexpectedly, Shanghai, thousands of miles away, also has the same idea, that is, the original second interport match on the 10th, in which the Chinese All-Star team would face Hong Kong, will also be changed to Lido facing Hong Kong. This move was raised for discussion by a certain member at the first group meeting. The reason is that Hong Kong vs. Lido is more attractive than Hong Kong vs. the Chinese All-Star team. This is because Lido and Eastern China have different styles and it is difficult to have a tacit understanding. Lido is currently a regular in Group A and was also last year's Scott Cup champion. If a whole club faces the visiting team, they believe that the results are often better than the Chinese All-Star team, which is formed with difficulty. The members present at the time, such as Brett, Compton, and Little, all absolutely agreed. However, the Westerners have no opinion on whether to face the visiting team in the name of the Chinese All-Star team or in the name of Lido, and will listen to the Chinese side's appropriate arrangements. It is learned that some powerful figures on the Chinese side also strongly advocate that Lido face Hong Kong alone. This move not only shows the improvement of the visiting team's club level, but also competes with the Hong Kong-Vietnam interport competition held during the Spring Festival. In fact, Dai Linjing has already abandoned his football career in Eastern China, Jia Youliang's injury has not yet recovered, and Chen Hongguang will soon leave Shanghai. The only two who are qualified to be selected are Zhuang Youren and Qin Bigao. However, Zhang Linggen's skills are no worse than Zhuang's, and Lu Zhongen and Li Yichen are all experienced and have their own merits. Therefore, the idea of Lido facing the visiting team will be announced after some time and after careful consideration.

Fourth Vocational Supplementary School: The spring term of the Fourth China Vocational Supplementary School attached to the China Vocational Education Society is scheduled to start on the 30th of this month.

### Lunar New Year: Hong Kong vs. Vietnam Football

Inter-city football matches, Hong Kong vs. Shanghai have become a reality, and the two major competitions of Hong Kong vs. Vietnam and Hong Kong vs. Philippines. According to Hong Kong news, Hong Kong vs. Vietnam has also become a reality, while Hong Kong vs. Philippines has been called off due to the Philippine side's refusal. However, the Lunar New Year in Vietnam will be extra lively, as in addition to Hong Kong vs. Vietnam, there will also be a Siamese football team visiting. In Hong Kong and Shanghai, where transportation is convenient, there have been no two inter-city matches staged. Vietnam, which is located in a remote corner of the sea, has unexpectedly gained this benefit, which is also facilitated by the international situation.

Hong Kong vs. Vietnam inter-city in Hong Kong's itinerary: The Vietnamese side accepted Hong Kong's invitation. A certain ship of the Wo Fat Company will arrive in Hong Kong around February 7th (Lunar New Year's Eve), staying at the Seaview Hotel. However, the ship will only stay in Hong Kong for three or four days before returning south, so it cannot play three games, etc. The Hong Kong Football Association members are very excited that Saigon has confirmed its arrival in Hong Kong and are very confident in requesting the shipping company to extend the deadline for returning south. Therefore, they have arranged the New Year schedule and selected staff and the Hong Kong team to show their preparation. The match schedule is as follows: 8th (Lunar New Year's Day), Hong Kong vs. Vietnam inter-city match, Causeway Bay stadium; 9th, Saigon team vs. Eastern Athletic Association, Causeway Bay stadium; 10th, Chinese United vs. Navy and Army United, Caroline Hill; 11th, Saigon team vs. South China Athletic Association, Causeway Bay stadium. In the afternoon, the Hong Kong Football Association will host a banquet for the Vietnamese inter-city team. 12th, the schedule is undecided. 13th, the Saigon team departs from Hong Kong.

The Hong Kong inter-city team roster for the Saigon team:

Robinson

Li Tiansheng, Bi Liban

Xu Jingcheng, Williamson, Song Lingsheng

Bi Fu, Tuo Ban, Li Huitang, Feng Jingxiang, Fu

Reserves: Deng Qin (Scottish), Li Guowei (Guanghua), Li Zhaorong (South China), Manager: Holland

### Japanese Troops Sneak Across the Qiantang River, Chinese Forces Block Them, Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Safe, Fierce Fighting in Keqiao, Fire in Linpu Shows Signs of Retreat

Since mid-month, Japanese troops have been harassing the coastal areas of eastern Zhejiang, shelling Longshan, Guanhaiwei, and other places. The details have been reported in previous newspapers. Subsequently, the Japanese troops in Hangzhou, taking advantage of the heavy snowfall on the 22nd at dawn, forcibly crossed the Qiantang River and landed near Xiaoshan. Ning-Shao compatriots residing in Shanghai were very uneasy after hearing the above news and sent telegrams to their hometowns to inquire. Speculators in the market also took advantage of this opportunity to become active. However, Ning-Shao was peaceful as usual, and the Shanghai-Ningbo shipping route was operating normally. The Wah Lun Shipping Company's Haida vessel set anchor at 3:00 PM yesterday and sailed to Zhenhai. The Sino-Italian Company's De Niu vessel, originally scheduled to return to Shanghai on the 22nd, was unable to load and unload cargo due to the heavy snow, so it could not arrive in Shanghai as scheduled. The vessel telegraphed yesterday, saying that it would definitely return to Shanghai tomorrow (the 26th), and the Dapu vessel would travel from Shanghai to Zhenhai on Saturday or Sunday (the 27th from Zhen back to Shanghai). Regarding the Japanese troops who forcibly crossed the Qiantang River, according to a certain shipping company's telegram from the Ningbo branch, "Fire in Linpu, our troops are encircling and annihilating, the enemy shows signs of retreat," etc. It is also reported that after the Japanese troops crossed the river, they advanced in two directions. One route invaded the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, but was met with a head-on blow by the Chinese army and showed signs of retreat. The other route attacked Shaoxing, encountering strong resistance at Keqiao, and is currently engaged in fierce fighting.

The Japanese Troops Crossing the River Are Already Unable to Hold On. Datong News Agency reports that the truth about the news of the Japanese troops in Hangzhou landing on the south bank of the Qiantang River only gradually became clear yesterday. The Japanese troops landed at the Six Hundred Mu Wharf and Huajia Village area along the river in Xiaoshan County on the morning of the 21st in rubber boats. They numbered only a few hundred men and are currently being blocked by local troops. The Japanese troops are already unable to hold on and are showing signs of retreating. The Japanese side's decision to risk crossing the river, although claiming that they would spy on Zhuji Fengqiao and the Shangjiang area from the Xiaoshan Riverbank to cut off the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, is actually only to cause harassment and will never succeed. According to the latest information from a Datong News Agency reporter, some of the Japanese troops who crossed the river have been defeated and fled back to the north bank. People in Shanghai and Zhejiang can be relieved.

Attempt to Invade Jinhua Will Definitely Fail. After the Shaoxing-based Shanghai Seven Counties Association telegraphed the Yuyao County magistrate to inquire about the truth of the Japanese troops landing in Xiaoshan, they received a telegram from the Yuyao China One Trust Company at 6:00 PM on the 23rd, stating, "Japanese troops have arrived in Xiaoshan, the situation is tense." According to a New Voice News Agency reporter's inquiry to relevant parties, Kanshan, which belongs to Xiaoshan County, has a beach near the river, which is Six Hundred Mu, 30 li away from Toupeng Town. The piers (i.e., beaches) along the river in the town are Sanche Wharf and Xiaojiao Wharf, both 6 li away from the town. There is a highway from Kanshan to Toupeng, which has now been destroyed. Defensive works have been built in Kanshan and Toupeng, and heavy troops are stationed there. On the morning of the 22nd, Japanese troops sneaked across the river to invade Kanshan, and the local garrison immediately dealt a heavy blow. At that time, there were more than 80 rubber speedboats and 6 Japanese planes providing cover. Many of them were sunk by the garrison. The artillery fire was very fierce at that time. The garrison resisted fiercely, with heroic sacrifices, and the Japanese troops suffered even more casualties. It is reported that the commander of the Third War Area has dispatched large forces to block them strictly. The Xiaoshao Highway is under strict guard. The local anti-Japanese self-defense corps has joined the resistance, and the provincial security team is also participating in the battle, so the military strength is strong. The Japanese troops' attempt to invade Jinhua along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Road will definitely fail.

The Fire in Linpu Shows Signs of Improvement. Last night, a telegram from Ningbo came to Shanghai reporting, "The fire in Linpu is showing signs of improvement, and there is hope that the Japanese will completely withdraw." A New Voice News Agency reporter also learned from relevant parties that a part of the Japanese troops who landed in Kanshan, Xiaoshan, advanced towards the county seat of Xiaoshan after landing. Their vanguard troops were surrounded and annihilated by the Chinese army in the suburbs of Xiaoshan. The streets near Linpu Railway Station, the starting point of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Road, have been on fire, reportedly caused by Japanese planes bombing. It is also reported that a certain unit of the Chinese army has launched an attack on Toupeng and Kanshan to cut off the Japanese troops' retreat. Regarding the rumors that the two Chinese banks of transportation in Shaoxing have withdrawn to Shengxian, a New Voice News Agency reporter inquired with the two banks yesterday and learned that they had not withdrawn as of last night. However, the Japanese troops' invasion of Xiaoshan is indeed a fact. Shaoxing and Xiaoshan city are still peaceful and heavily guarded. Residents have inevitably been evacuated. Telegrams from Ningbo, Taizhou, Wenzhou and other coastal areas to Shanghai reported peace.

It Is Not Difficult to Annihilate the Landing Japanese Troops. After Linpu became tense, the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway was changed to start from Zhuji and continued to operate normally. Heavy troops are stationed along the line, with Linpu having the most. This is because the road is the only important transportation line from Xiaoshan to Jinhua. The highways from Xiaoshan to Shaoxing and Ningbo, and the Xiaoshao-Ningbo section of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway, have long been completely destroyed. The mountains are densely packed everywhere, and it is by no means easy for the Japanese troops to attack Jinhua. Moreover, Kanshan in Xiaoshan faces Haining across the river, and the Qiantang River is 18 li wide, and there is a "Zhejiang Tide." Warships cannot sail, and rubber boats are not convenient for carrying heavy loads. Therefore, it is not difficult to annihilate the landing Japanese troops. According to a telegram received by the shipping industry in this city from Ningbo at 2:00 PM yesterday, "A large Chinese army is now departing from Jinhua and heading to the front line. It is heard that Liu Jianxu, commander-in-chief of the 10th Army Group, has arrived in Xiaoshan to supervise the battle. The Yongjin Highway is busy with military transport, and freight transport is completely blocked. All goods cannot be transported inland. Please stop loading immediately," etc. It is heard that there was an encounter battle near Anchang, which was extremely fierce.

### Three Iron Gates in the French Concession Reopened Yesterday, Citizens Visit Former Residences with Mixed Feelings, Gambling and Prostitution Are Already Active

After the Japanese puppets in Nanshi announced the reopening of traffic in Nanshi east of the Rihui Port the day before yesterday, the French Concession authorities, in response to their request, opened the three iron gates at Xieqiao, Nanyangqiao and Xinqiao Street, which had been closed for two years, at the same time at 11:00 AM yesterday, allowing citizens to enter and exit freely. The Xin Kaihe side also remained open as usual, and the original place was exclusively for vehicles to enter and exit, while pedestrians took another iron gate to the north to ensure safety. If no special accidents occur in the future, it is stipulated that the iron gates will be open from 6:00 AM to 12:30 AM when the curfew begins every day. However, the Japanese puppets in Nanshi have a curfew from 7:00 PM to 6:00 AM. It is not yet known whether this will be lifted. The details are recorded as follows:

Continue to Open from Today. Because yesterday was the first day of opening, the opening time was after 11:00 AM. Those who went to the iron gates to inspect before 11:00 AM did not see the opening. The three iron gates were opened until 6:00 PM yesterday before being closed. They will continue to open from today.

Visiting Former Residences after the Robbery. Yesterday afternoon, someone went to Xieqiao, Nanyangqiao, and Xinqiao Street to inspect the three iron gates and saw that the residents entering and exiting the above three places were still crowded. The reason these people entered Nanshi was not to return as the Japanese hoped, but to visit their former residences after the robbery. Their hearts were sad, and they had mixed feelings. It goes without saying.

All Citizen Certificates Can Be Used. The Xinqiao Street iron gate originally had four doors, but only two were opened yesterday. The one on the east side was only for vehicles to enter and exit, and the one on the west side, opposite the French Concession morgue, was for pedestrians entering and exiting. Regarding the traffic issue, since the opening of the Xin Kaihe iron gate, only a few people holding citizen certificates from September or earlier could enter and exit, which was very inconvenient for the public. However, from yesterday onwards, anyone east of the Rihui Port can pass through with a citizen certificate without restriction. At the same time, the Nanshi Wharf and Pudong Yangjiadu were allowed to ferry across the river.

Chinese and Western Vietnamese Police Stationed for Inspection. The French police station sent French police, Chinese police, Vietnamese police, and female inspectors to guard each iron gate yesterday to selectively inspect residents entering and exiting and record the number of people entering and exiting. Judging from yesterday's situation, the order was still good.

Gambling and Prostitution Have Been Announced to Open. The original purpose of the Japanese puppets opening Nanshi was to revive the Nanshi market with gambling and prostitution. The so-called "Revival Committee" is a combination of Japanese puppets who collude to make profits. Yesterday, the three iron gates in Nanshi were opened, and the general hooligans and gangsters were overjoyed. Prostitution houses, gambling dens, and other places that have already obtained licenses from the "Entertainment Supervision Department" have announced their opening for business. Dozens of gambling tables will also be fully opened in the shortest possible time. It is expected that Nanshi will soon be transformed into a bizarre and evil den.

Occupied Vehicles Will Start Running Next Month. Under the control of the Japanese army, the private and publicly operated properties of Chinese in Nanshi have long been looted by the Japanese. The trams on all routes of the former Nanshi Commercial Electric Company and the public buses on all routes of the China Merchants Public Bus Company have been looted and repainted with Japanese trademarks by the so-called "Japanese-owned China Public Bus Company" and the Japanese "Thunder Vehicle Company" and are scheduled to officially start running from the first day of next month.

### The People's Food Adjustment Association Urges Citizens to Join Group Rice Ordering as Soon as Possible, Ordering贡米in US Dollars at the Current Exchange Rate Still Pays Off, Hoping that Employees in All Industries Will Prepare Six Months of Rice

The Shanghai People's Food Adjustment Association issued a letter to the citizens yesterday, stating that since the establishment of the association, it has actively promoted the method of group rice purchase. The purpose is to (1) increase the source of rice and replenish Shanghai's rice reserves; (2) because the source increases and the rice reserves are sufficient, the demand will naturally decrease, and the rice price can be suppressed. The various sectors understand this meaning, and there are indeed many people who are enthusiastic about participating. However, there are also many people who are waiting and watching or are limited by their economic ability. Therefore, I will not hesitate to contribute a few suggestions in the following. I hope you will understand:

Rice Price Prediction (1) Due to various reasons, the rice price in Shanghai may continue to rise. I hope that people from all walks of life can purchase a large amount of rice as soon as possible while it has not continued to rise, so as to prepare for a rainy day. Then, the fear of rice shortage in the future may not occur. (2) I hope that all factories, shops, schools, and other groups and institutions can advance funds for their employees to purchase more than six months of rice reserves. (Saigon rice can be stored for two years without rotting.) All advances can be deducted from their salaries and wages separately and continuously. Such a method will not cause much loss to the factories themselves, but it will benefit all employees in terms of peace of mind. To seek labor-management cooperation, it is indeed a good opportunity. Not only that, at least two-thirds of the population of Shanghai is within the above-mentioned scope. If they can all be worry-free about rice for these six months, then most of Shanghai's food problem has been solved. And the remaining one-third of the population will also be unaffected by the high price of rice due to the large reduction in the need for rice on the market. Wouldn't the entire food problem be completely solved? (3) The Association also extremely agrees that all sectors can automatically raise enough money and order directly from foreign countries. The Association only hopes to increase Shanghai's rice reserves and has absolutely no intention of monopolizing the ordering of foreign rice on behalf of all sectors. However, there is one thing that must be mentioned, that is, I hope that all sectors will not purchase a large amount of rice locally in Shanghai. Because purchasing in Shanghai will not only fail to increase Shanghai's rice reserves but will also make Shanghai's rice reserves increasingly tight, which will be a great threat to the poor who eat by the liter. This must be paid attention to. (4) I hope that all industry associations can cooperate with the Association to persuade the member shops to understand the seriousness of the food problem in the future and the great impact on their industries. They should make a decisive decision and actively adopt the method of group rice purchase.

Rice Ordering Q&A (5) To make it easier for all sectors to understand the method of group rice purchase, the common inquiries are answered as follows: (Q) Why order foreign rice? (A) Due to various reasons, the source of domestic rice is not smooth, so we have to order foreign rice with pain to increase the source. (Q) How many types of foreign rice are there? (A) Due to transportation reasons, the Association currently only plans to order one type of Saigon rice for the time being. However, Saigon rice is also divided into grades. The top-grade rice has only 25 grains of broken rice per 100 grains, and the rice is white, which is a very high-grade rice. The second-grade rice has 40 grains of broken rice per 100 grains and is for general consumption. The third-grade rice has 60 grains of broken rice per 100 grains, and a type of broken rice is mixed with the top two grades, which is mostly for the poor or the working class. Because it is not easy for the Association to accumulate enough numbers for those who recently entrusted to order top-grade rice and broken rice, so for the sake of convenience, we are now only ordering one type of second-grade Saigon rice. This type of rice is most suitable for middle-class people. (Q) How much does foreign rice cost per picul? (A) Because market prices often fluctuate and the exchange rate changes daily, the official price can only be determined when the registration has accumulated enough numbers and the official order is placed. The Association has planned to order two batches of Saigon rice. The first batch of 6,000 bags, each bag is about 1 picul and 2.5 dou, priced at 43 yuan, 8 jiao and 3 fen. The second batch of 10,000 bags, each bag is 48 yuan, 8 jiao and 3 fen. The first batch is about 35 yuan per Shanghai picul, and the second batch is about 29 yuan per Shanghai picul. However, one bag can still be sold for about 2 yuan in the market, and the cost of transportation to the warehouse, insurance, etc., is about 1 yuan and 8 jiao per bag. (Q) Judging from the current situation, ordering foreign rice is not cheap. (A) Because the current rice in Shanghai is still ordered at the previous time, when the purchase price was lower, so the selling price is also cheaper. However, this amount of rice is limited, and once it is sold out, there will be problems. The Association is aware of this, so it hopes that all sectors will order as soon as possible to prepare. The current exchange rate is very good, and the ordering time is excellent. If the exchange rate is tight in the future, even if the rice price does not rise, the additional exchange rate difference will be more expensive than now. (Q) Since the rice price in Shanghai is low now, why not purchase it in Shanghai as much as possible? (A) Because purchasing locally in Shanghai will not increase Shanghai's rice reserves, but will make Shanghai's rice reserves tighter, which has been explained in detail before. Therefore, not only is it not adopted by the Association, but it is also hoped that it will not be done by all sectors. (Q) What is the procedure for ordering foreign rice? (A) Those who order rice (1) should first go to the Association (Room 304, 3rd Floor, 59 Hong Kong Road) to fill out an application form, and then go to the Trust Department of Jin Cheng Bank on Jiangxi Road to pay a deposit of 20 yuan per bag as a formal registration. (2) The Association will wait until the registration has accumulated a considerable number before ordering from foreign countries on its behalf. The ordering time is usually three weeks. (3) Once the fixed rice arrives in Shanghai, the Association will warehouse it on its behalf and notify the rice orderer to bring the deposit receipt to the Trust Department of Jin Cheng Bank to pay the full price of the rice, receive the warehouse receipt and ship it. (Q) Does the People's Food Adjustment Association charge a handling fee to each fixed household? (A) Absolutely no fee will be charged. It is completely free of charge. The accounts of each batch of orders are open, and they are distributed to each fixed household completely according to the cost price. As for the directors, committee members, treasurer, secretary, and staff of the Association, they are all volunteers. Two or three clerks are hired, with very small salaries, and other expenses are also very small. For the moment, they can support several months without requesting subsidies from any party. 1,500 yuan has been donated by enthusiastic people in the Association.

Use of Funds (Q) Why does the People's Food Adjustment Association want to raise funds? (A) Because the Association must have considerable funds to achieve the purpose of true adjustment, for example, (1) when the rice price is low, it can use the funds to buy in, and sell it as usual when the price rises, then it can receive the effect of balancing the rice price. (2) When the fixed number of households is insufficient, and the rice price is suitable for falling at this time, or it is just the time when the exchange rate improves, if there are funds, it can be ordered in advance, or the exchange rate can be settled in advance to prepare. (3) Each decision to order rice, due to various reasons, is more convenient to purchase in large quantities as a whole. If there are funds, then even if the fixed households have odd numbers of bags, the Association can make up the whole number to order. In short, the effect of the funds is very much, although it is not enough to list them one by one, but even these few points have already shown its importance. Therefore, I hope that those who have already recognized the payment will pay it as soon as possible, and those who seek to recognize it will also actively participate. Moreover, the funds are only used as a temporary turnover chip, and they will still be returned in accordance with the regulations in the future. Therefore, it is also very different from the nature of general donations. The Shanghai People's Food Adjustment Association announced that, because of insufficient distribution, the customs authorities made an exception to recruit Japanese customs officers, totaling more than 30 people, to meet this need. According to reporters' inquiries with the customs yesterday, the number of Japanese personnel is now three times higher than before, increasing to hundreds of people, all of whom are assigned to work there. As for the Chinese customs officers who performed anti-smuggling duties in Yangshupu, Pudong, and other places before the war, and a part of those who withdrew from the mainland to Shanghai, they are now assigned to perform their duties as usual along the Huangpu River and Suzhou Creek in the concession.

### Ambassador Johnson to Chongqing, American Judge Will Accompany, Court May Be Held Along the Way to Resolve American Cases, Ambassador Will Go to Kunming and Chongqing Via Highway

The Continental News reports that when US Ambassador Johnson departs for Chongqing on February 8 after returning to Shanghai from Hankou, Mr. Haymick, the prosecutor of the US Court in China, will also accompany the ambassador to Chongqing. According to Mr. Hay yesterday (the 23rd), his trip to Chongqing is only to spend the holidays and has no important significance. On the way back to Shanghai, the court may be held in Guangzhou for one day to resolve minor cases, most of which are real estate disputes. In addition, there will be no official business on the way. It is possible that the court will be held in a certain place in the mainland to resolve disputes between American overseas Chinese, but it has not been decided yet. It is reported that the US ambassador and his party will depart from Shanghai, take a boat for six days to Hanoi, stay for one day, take a train to Kunming, which will take two days, stay for a short time, and then take a car to Chongqing, which will take four days. Mr. Hay will stay in Chongqing for five weeks and then take a plane to Hong Kong and then to Shanghai, and he will be able to return to the city around March 10. Mr. Hay's trip to Chongqing will be decided as the first time. Major McHugh, assistant naval attache, and Lafon, the ambassador's private secretary, will accompany the ambassador to Chongqing at the same time. As for Major Meyer, the army attache, he may not go to Chongqing until the end of this month. The above-mentioned people are now following Ambassador Johnson on the US gunboat Luzon on the way to Hankou along the river.

### A Tour of the Three Iron Gates Opened Yesterday

— Yangtze River

Since the lone army that stubbornly defended Nanshi withdrew in tears from this ancient and historic city, the several iron gates connecting the French Concession to Nanshi have also been closed. For more than two years, these rusty, cold iron gates have become a gap between two different worlds of abnormal prosperity and special desolation.

Since the opening of the barbed wire frame south of the Xin Kaihe Water Tower on November 11 last year, the atmosphere of opening the other iron gates has been very noisy. Until yesterday, the Xieqiao and Nanyangqiao (the end of Minitney Road) and Xinqiao Street iron gates in the eastern district of the French Concession connecting Nanshi were finally opened at the same time.

Originally, many barbed wire, sandbag mounds, and other obstacles were placed on both sides of the iron gate. At about 10:00 AM yesterday, the patrolmen of the French Concession and the Japanese military police in Nanshi tried to remove them and opened the iron gate, divided into two traffic openings; one side was the "import" from Nanshi to the concession, and the other side was the "export" from the concession to Nanshi. Barbed wire frames were arranged in the middle, and the passing residents entered and exited on both sides.

The French Concession side stationed a dozen detectives and female inspectors at each iron gate to inspect residents entering the concession from Nanshi. Outside the iron gate stood equal numbers of Japanese military police and puppet police, strictly inspecting the residents passing through the iron gate and examining the fake "citizen certificates" in detail. However, the fake "citizen certificates" for October, November, and December, which were previously prohibited from passing through Xin Kaihe, could pass through the three newly opened iron gates yesterday.

After the robbery, Nanshi was unusually desolate. Yesterday, because it was the first day of opening, the residents entering and exiting were not very crowded. Most of them went to Nanshi to visit their former residences after the robbery, and some were refugees living in Nanshi who took the opportunity to visit the concession. At the same time, the iron gate opposite Tongren Fuyuantang on the east side of Xinqiao Street was also opened yesterday, but it was still blocked by an iron chain and was only used for vehicles to pass through, but the number of vehicles entering and exiting was very few.

The shops on both sides of Zhonghua Minguo Road, which is open in Nanshi, are still tightly closed, and the situation is very desolate. Several empty yards with broken walls and rubble have been repaired and decorated by the Japanese.

Recently, houses in various parts of Nanshi have been rented out, and many "clubs" and "paradises" are under construction in the Nine Mu Di area. A second "evil land" may appear here.

### Customs Increases the Number of Japanese Customs Officers, Reaching Hundreds, Working in Hongkou

Since the Jianghai Customs resumed anti-smuggling work in Hongkou, Yangshupu, and Pudong in June of the year before last, Chinese customs officers have been inconvenient to go there to perform their duties under special circumstances, and the number of Western anti-smuggling customs officers is very small in the customs, and they are not divided, so the customs authorities made an exception to recruit Japanese customs officers, totaling more than 30 people, to meet this need. According to reporters' inquiries with the customs yesterday, the number of Japanese personnel is now three times higher than before, increasing to hundreds of people, all of whom are assigned to work there. As for the anti-smuggling duties and a part of the Chinese customs officers who withdrew from the mainland to Shanghai, they are now assigned to perform their duties as usual along the Huangpu River and Suzhou Creek in the concession.

### Fake Police Extract Opium from English Ship; Gangsters Hear News and Obstruct, Resulting in Division of One Bag

According to the English-language *North China Daily News*, an English merchant ship sailing along the coast arrived in Shanghai from Tianjin on Sunday. It docked on the Bund outside the French Concession. Before [blank], customs inspectors boarded the ship for a search, finding no contraband. That night, a "Municipal Police Bureau" motorboat suddenly pulled up alongside the English ship, arousing suspicion among the customs inspectors. A second inspection was conducted, again without finding anything. The "Municipal Police Bureau" motorboat waited alongside the ship until about 5 a.m. yesterday (the 23rd), when thirty Chinese men emerged from the motorboat and carried off three sacks of opium from the English ship, totaling 280 pounds and valued at over 52,000 yuan. They returned to the boat and sailed to Pudong. After landing, they were suddenly confronted by twenty gangsters attempting to rob them. Those carrying the opium opened fire in self-defense. One gangster was injured in the left arm during the fighting. Eventually, both sides reached a compromise. The gangsters agreed to take one sack of opium, while the remaining two sacks were kept by the other party. They carried them to northern Pudong, crossed the river, and returned to Hongkou.

### Four Germans, Stowaways on Japanese Ship, Removed and Housed in Shanghai

Turned Over to German Consul-General in Shanghai; To Be Sent to German Ship in Nanshi

According to the *North China Herald*, the Japanese freighter *Korushima Maru* (transliteration) arrived in Shanghai at 8:15 p.m. on Sunday, carrying four German stowaways. They were removed by the Water Police, quarantined, and handed over to the German Consul-General in Shanghai. It is learned that the four Germans were part of the crew of five German ships that sought refuge in Sabang, northern Sumatra, Dutch East Indies. It is believed that two of the five German ships taking refuge in the East Indies, the *Lindenhall* and *Monnelly Hall* of the Rickmers Line, and the rest of the ships of the HAPAG Line, had been in Sabang since the outbreak of the European War on September 3rd last year. The *Korushima Maru* freighter, with a carrying capacity of 3,000 tons, was chartered by Mitsui Bussan Kaisha, Ltd. to transport goods from Sabang to Shanghai. Before the ship set sail from Sabang, the captain discovered fifteen German sailors hiding on board, intending to stow away to Shanghai, and had them removed from the ship. The four men who arrived in Shanghai on Sunday were apparently discovered after the ship had sailed into the sea. The *Korushima Maru* first stopped at Keelung, Taiwan, en route. The captain intended to remove the four Germans from the ship, but the Keelung authorities refused. He had no choice but to continue carrying them to Shanghai. When the ship arrived in port on Sunday night and docked at buoys 15 and 16, the captain handed the four Germans over to the Water Police to be transferred to the German Consul-General. The four men were all young people of military service age. Their arrival in Shanghai brought the total number of German sailors in Shanghai to

ninety-two. The German freighter *Ramses* of the HAPAG Line, a 10,000-ton ship currently docked upstream of the Nanshi water barrier, already houses eighty-eight German sailors. The four German sailors who arrived in Shanghai on Sunday will most likely be sent to the *Ramses* to live until the end of the war.

The State Department has also declined to comment. Other possible successors reportedly include Myers, Consul-General in Guangzhou, and others.

Appropriate Appointment

According to the *Continental Times*, yesterday (the 23rd), reliable sources reported that after the current U.S. Consul-General in Shanghai, Gauss, leaves Shanghai to take up a new post in Canberra, Australia, his vacant position will be filled by Lockhart, Counselor of the U.S. Embassy in Peiping.

Diplomatic Career

Mr. Lockhart was born in Pitsburg, Texas, USA, in 1881. He graduated from Grayson College. In 1900, he served as Assistant Editor of the Pitsburg newspaper. He then developed an interest in politics. In 1913, he served as Secretary to a Congressman and also worked in the Department of Agriculture. On July 29th of the following year, he became Assistant Director of the Far Eastern Division of the State Department, thus beginning his diplomatic career.

### Dai Chunfeng Suggests Building a Hall of Longevity for Ma Xiangbo

The Shanghai All-Circles Commemoration Committee for Ma Xiangbo recently approved a suggestion from Preparatory Committee member Dai Chunfeng: "Among the Five Blessings in the *Hong Fan*, longevity is the most important. To nurture oneself to the age of one hundred is rare. Recalling that Master Ma Xiangbo was born in Danyang, he was uniquely blessed by Heaven. He founded Aurora University, and many people were educated by him. Moreover, his lifelong endeavors were based in Shanghai. After years of toil, and not long after moving to Liangshan, the star of longevity suddenly fell, and the world lost a role model. Consequently, there is no exemplary figure to inspire national strength and enlightenment. If we do not commemorate him, how can we encourage future generations? Furthermore, whenever the Master encountered famine and disaster, he always prioritized broad relief to help people. Having experienced great calamities in his youth, he was able to embrace all with compassion and was willing to be a renowned teacher. He also oversaw extensive translation work, commissioned by the National Government, fully embodying loyalty and integrity, practicing benevolence and righteousness, tirelessly working for a century, establishing virtue and words that will last for millennia. Now that the National Government has resolved to establish a Hall of Longevity, countless citizens of Shanghai, as students of the Master and as those who have privately admired him, and those who have received his education and benevolence, should also establish a Hall of Longevity. Ideally, it should be built in or near the Xujiahui Catholic Church area, to erect a hall and statue for the Master as a lasting memorial, shining brightly alongside Xu Guangqi. The people of Shanghai will surely support this initiative. I hereby suggest this to your committee for your consideration." The committee decided to submit the above suggestion for public resolution at the memorial service.

### Rent Increase Case on Medhurst Road, Shouchun Lane

The houses in the Shouchun Lane area on Medhurst Road in this city are owned by Wang Zuoliang of the Shouchun Company. In June of last year, all tenants were notified of a proposed 30% rent increase starting in July, which was unsuccessful. Subsequently, the company entrusted lawyers Gu Changyuan and Xi Jien to represent them and sent letters to each tenant to comply. After failing to reach a mediation agreement in court, they filed a petition with the Shanghai First Special District Court, citing increased water costs as the reason, requesting a rent increase ranging from 38% to 50%. The tenants elected representatives from 57 households in the lane to jointly retain lawyers Shen Yide, Zhu Wende, and Xi Mengqi to respond according to the law. The case was heard on the 18th of this month by Judge Ni Zheng [blank]. The tenants argued that the value of real estate in the city had not increased, and there was no legal justification for a rent increase. After hearing arguments from both sides, Judge Ni scheduled the verdict for yesterday.

### New Recruits of the 2nd Brigade of the Provincial Security Force Arrested Upon Returning to Camp

The area north of Sha Hai and Haimen was originally garrisoned by Chen Caifu's guerrilla unit. After repeatedly clashing with Japanese forces, Chen surrendered to the Japanese army. His unit was reorganized as a self-defense corps. Before long, they shot and killed a Japanese officer and several Japanese soldiers in Haimen. Angered by this deception, the Japanese army launched an attack. The Jiangsu Provincial Government dispatched the 2nd Brigade of the Provincial Security Force to Haimen to resist. Chen's unit was ordered to be transferred to Rugao for garrison duty. At the end of November of last year, the headquarters of the 4th Regiment of the 2nd Brigade of the Provincial Security Force sent a service member, Zhao Xuejin, to various places to recruit new soldiers. At the end of December, he led the twenty-four newly recruited soldiers aboard a ship to return to camp. Unexpectedly, they were captured by the Japanese navy on the ship and later taken to the San Chang for interrogation. It has recently been reported that Zhao has escaped, but the fate of the remaining twenty-four men is currently unknown.

### Ningbo Shanghai Fellow-Provincials Association Relieves Xiangshan Flood Disaster

The Ningbo Shanghai Fellow-Provincials Association, deeply concerned about the severe flood disaster that occurred in Xiangshan County last autumn, resolved at its regular meeting to allocate 1,000 yuan to relieve the flood-stricken areas of Xiangshan.

### Shanghai Cold Wave Has Not Receded, Frozen Corpses Pile Up on the Streets, River Ice Causes Reduction in Ships Arriving in Shanghai, High-Pressure System Will Pass Over Shanghai Towards the East China Sea

After a sudden cold snap due to a high-pressure system from northwestern China, the weather in this city remained bitterly cold yesterday. At 5:00 or 6:00 a.m. yesterday morning, the temperature dropped to minus 5 degrees Celsius, or 23 degrees Fahrenheit, extremely cold. This caused thick ice to form on ditches, rivers, and water storage facilities. After advancing from the Yangtze River basin to Shanghai, the high-pressure system in northwestern China began moving southeast yesterday, apparently heading towards the East China Sea. Therefore, it is unlikely that this cold weather in this city will last long. The weather is expected to become slightly milder in the coming days. The temperature in Peiping yesterday was also only minus 6 degrees Celsius, comparable to the weather in southern China.

Piles of Frozen Corpses

Inland waterways have also become difficult to navigate due to thin ice. The number of ships arriving in Shanghai on the Suzhou Creek yesterday morning was very low. Moreover, the refugees wandering the streets, unable to withstand the onslaught of the cold, presented a pitiful sight. The number of corpses frozen to death on the streets has increased dramatically. According to Pushan Villa, a total of twenty-three corpses found on the streets were collected and buried the day before yesterday (the 23rd), as well as twelve corpses from refugee shelters and hospitals, and fifty corpses of children.

### Young Girl Zhang Jinfeng Lured into a Brothel; Young and Ignorant, Forced into Prostitution, Pimp and Procuress Among Seven Arrested

Zhang Jinfeng, a girl from Ningbo, fifteen years old, was betrothed as a child bride to Xu Peijin (fifteen years old), the son of Xu Meilin from Wuxi. Xu Meilin entrusted her child bride Zhang Jinfeng to her friend Pan Jinsheng (at 45 Putuo Road), and Pan introduced Zhang to work at the Ewo Cotton Mill to earn a living. However, while working at the factory, Zhang met Yao Amao, a woman from Hangzhou who also worked at the factory. On the fifteenth of the month, Yao lured Zhang to her home at 25 Xiangkang Lane, Mayers Road, and then took her to various entertainment

### Grain: Wheat Rises to 20 Yuan; Flour at 10 Yuan is Rarely Available; The People's Food Prospects Become More Difficult

Yesterday's flour trading had reached a point where there were offers but no buyers. Although factories nominally maintained the original price of 10 yuan, it was difficult to purchase even small transactions of 300 to 500 bags at this price. The factories' main interest lies in profit, so why would they sacrifice it? Recently, they have become even more extreme, restricting sales to customers and also causing an invisible stagnation in retail transactions within the district. As a result, people are becoming increasingly panicked, and the seriousness of the situation is evident. This has driven rice prices to become increasingly firm and expensive. Yesterday, rice shops repeatedly had their requests to purchase ready-made flour rejected. There are rumors that the supply to this port is limited to 5,000 bags per day, which has yet to be confirmed, but discussions are rampant. It is said that yesterday, returned goods to the market were also held back due to the above situation. Only old cart stations were selling at 11.25 yuan. Foreign flour prices have reached 12 yuan, but there is still considerable supply. Even Japanese-made Phoenix brand flour is a rare commodity, and factories are even buying it back, a situation rarely seen. Since rice prices have become expensive, most people have been using flour-based foods to fill their stomachs. Now that flour prices are higher than rice prices, and even deep-fried dough sticks and large pancakes are unaffordable, the people's food prospects are becoming even more difficult.

Yesterday, wheat actually saw a new high price of 20 yuan, and transactions were very lively. Currently, factories are restricting supply more and more severely, and people's confidence is increasing. The general market is exporting three or four cartloads through the Shantou gang. The Japanese factories are handling more than ten cartloads through Xie Xing. The Chinese factories, Fuxin and Fufeng, are jointly handling 6,500 bags, with Suzhou-Wuxi wheat at 20 yuan, Zhenjiang wheat at 19.9 yuan, Yangzhou wheat also reaching 19.8 yuan, and Changzhou-Wuxi wheat at 19.6 yuan. The intensity of the price surge is unprecedented.

### Rice Prices Remain Speculative; Wuxi Rice Prices Have Started to Decline Slightly

The previous rice market continued to decline. Yesterday morning, local shops took advantage of the low prices to make purchases, but the supply from inland areas suddenly became scarce, strengthening confidence. Prices immediately rose, and merchants revived speculative activities, causing the market to rebound. Various grades of thick japonica rice had limited transactions due to scarce supply, with middle-grade goods opening at 40 yuan and 39.67 yuan. Other, especially thin grades from Biaosi, opened at 40 yuan to 37.8 yuan. By the close of the market, prices had increased by two to three jiao compared to the previous closing prices. Special-grade Baiyuan goods were priced at 40 yuan to 39 yuan, but the middle-grade Danyang goods were popular, and the situation was tight. They opened high at 38.5 yuan, with guest rice at 37 yuan. Saigon and other foreign rice were selling well in inland markets, while there was only a slight bit of activity in the district, with transactions not exceeding 4,000 to 5,000 bags. Prices increased by three to five jiao. No. 1 Saigon closed at around 39.4 yuan, while No. 2 Saigon ranged from 38.78 yuan to 38.34 yuan, and Fire-pattern rice ranged from 38.12 yuan.

After increasing the water freight, foreign rice became more expensive due to the shortening of exchange rates. It became increasingly difficult to obtain high-end foreign rice. Yesterday, foreign merchants quoted Saigon broken rice at 37.5 yuan and 37 yuan, which was about 4 yuan higher than the 33 yuan of the previous week. Grain merchants found it difficult to obtain all the batches they telegraphed orders for. After a sharp rise, the suppliers of returned broken rice became even more speculative yesterday. Only 50 tons of road goods were sold in the general market. Currently, all grades of Saigon rice are uniformly demanding higher prices, but the willingness of importers to purchase is also waning, and prices are ultimately rising by two to three jiao.

Yesterday, another 1,824 bags of foreign rice arrived from Hong Kong on the Taikoo Company's Guangdong ship and are being unloaded.

Wuxi rice prices had recently risen sharply by three to four yuan due to large-scale purchases by Japanese merchants in Wuxi. Now, because the Japanese merchants also consider the prices to be too high, they have temporarily suspended purchases. They must wait for the contractors to clear the previous goods and make a conclusion before determining whether to continue ordering based on market conditions. However, the rice market tea parties have become abnormal, with prices rising by seven to eight jiao in a single day. On the 22nd, the opening price of white japonica rice was 23.78 yuan per stone, which was three jiao higher than the previous day. By noon, the willingness of factories to purchase had waned slightly, and most surplus profit merchants and hoarders were willing to sell. The market's willingness to purchase had changed to a wait-and-see attitude, and transactions became sluggish, with prices softening slightly by three to five jiao. Japonica paddy ranged from 11.3 yuan to around 11 yuan, while Baiyuan paddy ranged from 21 yuan to 21.67 yuan. The supply of Yuan paddy was endless, but the distilleries' sales were limited. Although the Lunar New Year is approaching, most lower- and middle-class families have economic difficulties, and sugar prices are high, so the customary practice of steaming cakes has become lukewarm. Glutinous rice has even less of a market. Due to the unauthorized price increases by fifteen rice mills, including Xingshun, etc., and not trading in the market as stipulated, they have been publicly discussed for punishment. Whether rice prices will rise or fall in the future depends on whether Japanese merchants and factories will resume frantic purchases. (Knowledge)

### Silk and Tea: Domestic and Foreign Silk Markets Slightly Stabilize

Yesterday's silk market seemed slightly stable. New York's near-term price rose by two points, and the far-term price rose by a small five points. Yokohama's spot price remained unchanged, and the far-term price fell by sixteen yuan. There were some export transactions in the local silk market, but the selling prices varied. On the same day, the same quality silk had a price difference of 100 to 200 yuan. Renchang and Lianna jointly purchased 50 loads of white factory silk, with prices ranging from 5,150 yuan to 5,300 yuan, which seemed to have stabilized compared to the beginning of the week. On the 24th, 306 pieces of tea leaves were shipped from Hong Kong.

### Finance: The Rush to Buy Foreign Exchange Gradually Dissipates

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no fluctuations in the HSBC exchange rates. The black market for British and American exchange rates had calmed down and returned to a state of fluctuation, with alternating gains and losses. The final tightening was minimal, mainly due to the supply from Hong Kong telegrams. There were no significant future news, and a return to relaxation was not difficult. The opening rates were flat, remaining at 4s 6.875d and 7.75 yuan. Later, because Sassoon continued to purchase February shillings and Chinese merchants also bought, the state tightened to 4s 6.40625d and 7.65625 yuan. Subsequently, a sudden influx of tens of thousands of pounds from Hong Kong telegrams, while buyers reduced their purchases, caused the market to immediately return to flatness. However, HSBC seized the opportunity to absorb, which caused the foreign firms to rush in, and the market image softened again, falling back to 4s 6.5625d and 7.6875 yuan. But Sassoon came to cash out its long positions for the month, and as the number of purchasers gradually decreased, the noon close was still at 4s 6.71875d and 7.71875 yuan. The result was a slight tightening of 0.015625d and 0.0315 compared to the previous day. The potential trend of futures was the same as that of spot.

Hong Kong Supplied Tens of Thousands of Pounds

In the early morning, the London big bar and Bank of America prices remained flat. The London gold price was fixed. The exchange rates for British against American and French remained flat, while against Shanghai, it contracted by 125. The American against British increased by 875, against French by a large half point, and against Shanghai by a small 15 jiao. The Central Bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. The banks' opening spot selling prices were 4s 6.875d for British gold and 7.75 yuan for American exchange, with no gains or losses compared to the previous close. After the opening, Sassoon first purchased February British gold at 4s 5.9375d, and speculators also simultaneously purchased February American exchange at 7.59375 yuan and 5625 yuan. At that time (9:20 AM), the spot prices also softened to 4s 6.40625d and 7.6525 yuan. HSBC's listing remained unchanged, and there was no increase or decrease in the silver equalization tax. Subsequently, a sudden influx of tens of thousands of pounds from Hong Kong telegrams caused the situation to return to flatness once. The sales to HSBC and other foreign firms were 4s 6.875d for spot British gold, and the spot American exchange also hardened to 7.75 yuan. Subsequently, due to the busy settlement of accounts by foreign firms and the cessation of supply from Hong Kong telegrams, it tightened and softened again. The foreign firms settled February American exchange at 7.625 yuan and March American exchange at 7.5 yuan. At that time, the spot prices tightened again to 4s 6.5625d and 7.6875 yuan. Later, Sassoon suddenly re-released February British gold at 4s 6.71875d. Transactions decreased at noon, and the market image gradually flattened. Until the noon close, the banks' spot selling prices were 4s 6.71875d for British gold and 7.71875 yuan for American exchange, with the next month's futures at 4s 6.09375d for British gold and 7.59375 yuan for American exchange. The result was a slight tightening of 0.015625d for the current British gold and a slight softening of 0.03125 for the American exchange compared to the previous day. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon.

Hong Kong Shanghai Exchange Rose by Seven Yuan

### Tianjin Banks Poured Out; The Gold Market Wanted to Rise But Fell Instead

Yesterday's situation in the black market for spot gold bullion was barely satisfactory. According to the potential trend of the previous day, it was not unexpected for it to continue to rise by several tens of yuan. Unexpectedly, the result was a small decrease of over ten yuan. This was because foreign exchange continued to tighten by very little and entered a small fluctuating trend, causing many large households to be greatly disappointed. In addition, the continuous pouring out by the Tianjin banks caused confidence to reverse again. Although the Hong Kong banks came to search in the middle, the supply was no match for the demand, and it ultimately fell by thirteen yuan. The morning opening continued the residual momentum of the previous night, and with the exchange market reported tightening, it continued to rise by thirty-two yuan, reaching a peak of 4,160 yuan. It was heard that foreign exchange had returned to relaxation, and the multi-party was quite depressed. Retail investors came out in droves, and the securities banks replaced the Tianjin banks in vigorously supplying, and it immediately saw a fall, twice reaching 4,115 yuan. However, at this time, the exchange market suddenly tightened again, and it rose again to 4,140 yuan. Ultimately, because foreign exchange soon returned to hardening, and the Tianjin banks still had outpourings, and gold shops and money exchange businesses also came to compete in selling, although a Hong Kong bank commissioned a certain silver shop to buy over three hundred taels, it still resulted in supply exceeding demand. Until the noon close, it was only at 4,126 yuan. In the afternoon, the foreign exchange market was closed, and the fluctuations were quite flat, but the trend was weak. Although the Hong Kong banks continued to drag in, the floating multi-party had completed its settlement, so the evening close was only at the low price of 4,115 yuan. The total transaction volume for the whole day was about 1,300 to 1,400 taels. The silver shops' ornament silver decreased by a small five yuan, and the customs gold remained flat.

Bullion Fell by Thirteen Yuan

Since the early morning, for each bar (ten taels), the opening exchange market was reported tightening, and the sentiment was very strong. Money exchange shops, etc., raised prices to search in. The market opened at 9:20 AM, already made higher by thirty-two yuan. Money exchange businesses entered twenty taels of gold to the gold shop, for 4,160 yuan. Shortly thereafter, foreign exchange suddenly reported returning to hardening, and confidence frequently loosened. Many households that had made a profit came to take advantage of the high prices to supply out, and most buyers were at a loss, and it immediately decreased by forty-five yuan. Money exchange businesses output twenty taels of gold to the gold shop, for 4,115 yuan. At that time, a certain money exchange business saw an opportunity to scavenge in over one hundred taels, once pulling it up to 4,130 yuan. But ultimately, because the sellers were still pouring out, the securities banks sold a lot, and it returned to under 4,115 yuan. Subsequently, with the exchange market reported tightening again, the buying sentiment revived. A certain securities bank and various retail investors competed to first absorb, and it gradually rose by twenty-five yuan. The securities bank entered twenty taels of gold to the money exchange business, for 4,140 yuan. Thereafter, foreign exchange returned to hardening again, and the selling sentiment revived. A certain securities bank came again to supply out, and at the same time, a certain gold shop also sold, and it decreased again, stepping down fourteen yuan. The gold shop output twenty taels to the money exchange business, for 4,126 yuan. Later, a certain silver shop suddenly assisted the Hong Kong banks in vigorously entering several hundred taels, but the sellers' intention to supply was quite good, and only saw it raise by four yuan. A certain silver shop entered twenty taels of gold to the gold shop, for 4,139. Afterwards, the Hong Kong banks stopped entering, and it was immediately seen to return to 4,126 yuan, as the noon closing price. In the afternoon, the market trend was weak. The market opened decreased by six yuan. A certain silver shop output twenty taels to the money exchange business, for 4,120 yuan. Later, although a certain silver shop again assisted the Hong Kong banks in scavenging in over one hundred taels, the retail investors took advantage of the opportunity to unload, and the head position conversely felt that the supply exceeded demand, and it decreased by another five yuan. A certain silver shop output thirty taels to the securities bank, for 4,115 yuan, as the evening closing price. The result was that it decreased by thirteen yuan compared to the previous day. After the close, it was even lower by two yuan, for 4,113 yuan, and it was still difficult to find buyers. The total fluctuation was forty-five yuan. The selling price of the cash shop's own brand gold was several yuan higher according to the bullion, and the purchase price was reduced by twenty yuan. The current standard gold was over fifty yuan lower according to the listed gold, and there were few transactions.

Ornament Gold Decreased by Five Yuan

The silver shops' jewelry gold, when initially exchanging per tael, Datong Firm still suspended 410 yuan, until 2:50 PM, a small five yuan was suspended. The result was that Datong Firm changed to suspend 415 yuan. The new firms had the same prices as the above prices, and the purchase price was reduced by a small fifteen yuan in total.

American Gold Notes Alone Saw Loosening and Cheapening

Yesterday's foreign currencies, the British and American gold pounds, the need was gradually easing, and the market situation was stable. The supply and demand trends for British and American gold notes diverged. The British gold notes were stable in the morning, and the need in the afternoon was quite strong, and the market price rose again. The evening market was 47.5 yuan. The American gold notes were quite outstanding initially, and the market price rose to 12.96 yuan. Unfortunately, the customers supplied out due to profits, and the market situation gradually loosened and softened. The evening market decreased to 12.78 yuan, conversely being weaker than the previous day. The Hong Kong notes continued to be popular because of the sparse supply. The Dutch, Annam, and Robby notes were quite strongly needed, and all showed an increase. The Indian notes had a sparse supply and an increased need, and the market price sharply increased. The need for the Japanese gold notes had eased, and the market situation gradually weakened. The evening market was 1.263 yuan. The Korean notes also decreased to 1.035 yuan in the evening. Yesterday's market prices saw British gold notes increase by five jiao, American gold notes decrease by seven fen, Hong Kong and Annam notes increase by two fen each, Dutch and Robby notes increase by one jiao each, and Indian notes increase by three jiao. The other currencies had no changes.

### Securities: No New Progress in Domestic Bonds

Yesterday's market situation for securities in the black market first fell and then returned, and the trend turned chaotic. The multi-party was unwilling to sacrifice because of the interest relationship, and the empty-party was able to use all sorts of rumors. But in reality, the rise and fall of the bond market thereafter should depend on whether investors can develop interest. Yesterday morning, those tightly held such as Hengfu, Hongkang, and No. 7 were first released. There was not much need for Tiansheng, Xieda, etc., and the market price gradually weakened. Although Lianyi, Daqing, and No. 38 still had purchases, the unloading of retail investors was not weak. In the afternoon, Xinfu No. 35 and Lianyi, etc., continued to have purchases, and No. 38 and Tiansheng both had outputs. No. 24 and Lianyi also had sales, and the market price was stable. After entering, Sankaifeng, Datong came to acquire, and Hongda and Yongkang had a relatively sparse supply, and the prices slightly increased. Thus, the resulting market prices were seen to be mutually high and low. Class Ding alone was good by three jiao at most, Class Bing was slightly good by five fen, and the remainder still contracted by a small five fen to two jiao. The total transaction volume was about over 700,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below:

### Yarn and Cotton: Tianjin Banks Acquire Coarse Yarn; The General Bullish Investors Still Come to Buy

The yarn market remained quiet and stable. The sales of existing yarn continue unabated in the small transactions of the Hong Kong banks. The Tianjin banks slightly acquired coarse yarn, but the amount was very small, so confidence was still able to be maintained. The three major overseas cotton markets have been falling more and more fiercely. However, foreign exchange has tightened again, offsetting each other, so the market has not been affected and remains stable. The majority of psychological is bullish. However, there are quite a few people who have a lot of chips and are selling off February futures.

The spot cotton opened in the morning because the exchange rates had been changed to contraction on the afternoon of the previous day, and the miner's sentiment was quite outstanding. There were more buyers' thoughts, so although the foreign cotton fell sharply, it did not hurt. The asking price for 20-count Shuangma was 734 yuan, up one yuan from the previous day. After a while, it was heard that foreign exchange had continued to tighten, and the buying sentiment revived, and the market situation slowly rose. The 20-count Shuangma rose to 737 yuan. Unexpectedly, after the price was high, there were conversely sales and it fell again. The statistics for the number of transactions in half a day totaled 1,895 bales.

Fellow Traders 1,360 Hong Kong 340

Tianjin 170 Mainland 25

Total 1,895

The Overseas Cotton Market's Falling Trend Turned Fierce

The Domestic Cotton Is In A State Of Stagnation

The transaction of the domestic cotton was exceptionally silent. This was because the end of the year was approaching day by day, and most people were preparing to collect the accounts and close the books, and business became clearer. In addition, the overseas Indian and American cotton markets had a fierce falling trend, causing people to wait and see. However, the wind of exchange contraction revived, and the two currently offset each other, so business stagnated. The source from Northern Jiangsu was estimated to be 1,142 bales of Tonghua. The current spot cotton transaction situation is recorded on the left.

Tongzhou Jian 174.00 Fellow Traders Entered 200 Bales

American Type 194.80 Also 200 Bales

Good Tongzhou 173.00 Also 148 Bales

In other news, the market price of foreign cotton, the New York cotton market, was particularly weak in the early morning yesterday, first because of the fall of the telegram from Liverpool, and the cotton price fell by over ten pounds.

The resulting lowest price close fell more than thirty pounds for the near-term again compared to the previous day, and the far-term fell by over forty pounds. Indian including predictions fell by six rupees, Egyptian fell by forty-fifty pounds, and Liverpool fell by over twenty pounds.

The trading of foreign cotton in Shanghai port had shown a more active state in the previous few days. Recently, suddenly due to the tightening of exchange rates, transactions have turned quiet. In the past two days, also due to the fierce fall in the overseas cotton market, fellow traders, those who have hands in goods, are unwilling to sell cheaply. Moreover, they had already raised the funds, so they intend to wait quietly until after the New Year before discussing transactions again. The price of yesterday's cotton market, converted to the factory price with an exchange rate of 7.75 for American exchange, is as follows:

20-count American middling 230.40

20-count American middling lower grade 225.00

32-count American middling lower grade 233.50

42-count American middling 242.50

42-count American middling lower grade 238.00

### Oil Market: Bean Oil Hoarders Rise Again

The bean oil market situation turned to show an upward trend, but the fluctuations were still uneven. The reason is that the district's graveyard has always taken the bean oil industry market prices as the standard, so at this time, near the end of the year, it is unwilling to have a cold market, causing the sellers to take advantage of the opportunity to reach for scarcity and intentionally raise the price. Thus, the market situation turned up. Looking back, the barrelled oil still opened at the original price, but the potential trend of the overall situation could not avoid being slightly affected, so the hoarders were quite active, settling for the purchase of 7-800 barrels of Dalian crude oil, with a price of 97.5 yuan for the original price. The Changzhou factory's barrelled oil for the second lowering of the barrels, with a price of 97 yuan, and 50 pieces of Jiaozhou oil, with a price of 73 yuan. The peanut oil export banks are still unmoved, and the purchase appetite in the district has also turned weak, so although the market price has continued to increase, the overall situation has a sign of turning firm. Yesterday, only 30 barrels of Tianjin barrelled oil were traded, with a price of 102 yuan, and 80 barrels of Qingdao road goods barrelled oil, with a price of 104 yuan. Also, 80 barrels of raw oil, with a price of 104 yuan. Also, 380 cans of raw oil are being shipped to Hong Kong today.

Also, 1,450 bags of soybeans and 520 bags of raw kernels are being shipped to Hong Kong.

### Piece Goods: 100,000 Pieces of Cotton Cloth Transacted in the District

Yesterday, the cloth market slightly loosened, because Eastern Zhejiang issued a warning, and the Ningbo and Shaoxing banks stopped transacting and loading. The various goods already entered had slight re-sales, but the purchasing appetite of the Guangdong and Hong Kong banks had more development than before. Because the foreign exchange market turned tight, the Eastern piece goods increased in price, so people's hearts were uncertain, and the selling price showed a fluctuating state, and the increase and decrease were very slight. Nearly 100,000 pieces of existing gray cloth and February-March futures were transacted in the district. The Guangdong banks transacted over 200 pieces of bleached cloth, colored cloth, colored twill, coarse and fine cloth. The Guangdong and Hong Kong banks transacted over 100 bales of coarse twill and coarse cloth. The Tianjin and Yu-Lu (Henan-Shandong) banks transacted over 8,000 pieces of blue cloth, coarse cloth, and poplin. The Nanyang banks transacted 50-60,000 pieces of bleached cloth, bleached twill, and red foreign labels, etc. Also, 164 pieces of cloth are being shipped to Hong Kong today.

### Sugar Market: Both Coarse and White Sugar Saw Increases

Yesterday, the sugar market saw another upward expansion because foreign exchange contracted. The guild's listed prices for existing 24 coarse white sugar were 58 yuan for the home store, 58.5 yuan for the newly arrived foreign store, 58 yuan for the old goods, and 56.5 yuan for the oil-packed goods, all increasing by one yuan. The increase for transshipment goods was the same, at 47 yuan. Taikoo Car White increased by 1.3 to 5 jiao, with B-mark West Store at 58.5 yuan, and East Store at 58 yuan. CW-mark West Store was at 57 yuan, and East Store was at 56.5 yuan. The remaining CW-mark, etc., West Store was at 56 yuan, and East Store was at 56 yuan. Dutch Red increased by 5 jiao, to 44.5 yuan. Kapok White increased by one yuan, Zhenji No. 1 was at 58 yuan, and No. 2 was at 57.5 yuan. Hongyi No. 1 Ice also increased by one yuan, to 69.5 yuan, No. 2 was at 69 yuan, and Jingming Ice was at 70.5 yuan. The transactions of national currency were sluggish, with only tens of bales of Kai Chu and Hua Qing being opened, with a price of 43.8 yuan cash. Xinghua Sliced Qing called for 42 yuan cash, but there was no transaction. The industry-side had no intention to enter more because closing was approaching and the prices were high, so there was even a lack of transactions. In-coming goods included 403 bales from Xiamen imported on the Guangdong ship, also 45 bales from Hong Kong, and 18 pieces of boxed sugar.

### North-South Goods: Rumor of a Ban on the Transport of Xuzhou Vegetables

According to a telegram from a customer in Xuzhou yesterday, a certain party has banned the transport of golden vegetables. At the time, it could not be loaded, so the goods in transit should follow the instructions of the firm to hold back in order to improve and remedy the situation.

### Coal: Coal Balls Continue to Rise by Six Yuan; Adding 17 Yuan Per Ton Within a Week; Hoping the Coal Industry Will Exert Efforts to Maintain a Fair Price

The market price for coal balls has been wildly rising in recent days due to the impact of coal dust and water freight. Currently, the coal balls of the large factories of Nanyang, Yitaixing, and Guohua companies are being priced down and are continuing to rise by six yuan. The prices are 90 yuan per ton on a delivery from the cart station and 92 yuan for delivery to the house. The retail price at the gate is set at 4.8 yuan per load. This is an increase of 17 yuan per ton in a week. It is hoped that the coal industry will exert efforts to maintain [a fair price] and not allow unscrupulous merchants to manipulate it, affecting the livelihoods of ordinary people.

### Metals: Wes Iron Relies Solely on Factory Sales

The sales of Wes Iron has always been most widespread among the district's can factories, toy factories, printing factories, biscuit companies, and cigarette companies. Although these factories still purchase, the number is not many. The small business of outside districts is entirely insignificant. Yesterday, the total sales in the city was approximately 140 boxes, the majority of which was to can factories. The market price had no drastic changes, so there were no major increases or decreases. The old steel factory was sold at 145 yuan per box, the new steel factory was sold at 140 yuan, and the miscellaneous goods were sold at 130-some yuan.

A Small Discussion

### The Scholar Goes Out!

— Huang Jiayin

"The scholar doesn't leave home, yet knows the affairs of the world."

Using this sentence as an advertisement for newspapers or magazines might be clever, but this one sentence has misled countless modern Chinese "scholars."

Sitting on a comfortable sofa, flipping through newspapers and magazines, one can indeed know a little about the great affairs of the world. However, living in the 20th-century society, simply "knowing" about world affairs is not enough. We should have a more in-depth observation and a clearer understanding. We should be able to analyze and explain. To understand the trend of contemporary social history, simply knowing a little about the facts is definitely not enough.

Prices have risen, and the lives of ordinary people have become even more difficult. Therefore, modern "scholars" write a lot of sentimental articles in a classical style. The subject matter is good, and the writing is also good, but they are often not moving enough, not profound enough.

Why is this? I say it may be because of the "scholar doesn't leave home" relationship, resulting in a bit of detachment from the lives of ordinary people.

To understand the great trends of the world, to recognize the face of society, to determine the trend of history, our scholars must go out, visit factories, prisons, interview slums, shelters, and "not be ashamed to ask," talk to dockworkers, newsboys, typesetters, rickshaw pullers, and any other compatriots who do the most basic grassroots work in society. Only such scholars can truly know the affairs of the world.

### Prison University

— Wenhe

The "Free Talk" of January 20th said: "…Like the current situation of indiscriminately locking up all 'social sinners' together, and releasing them when their 'sentence is up,' leaving their future life and death to their own devices, isn't this akin to burying one's head in the sand?" But there are prisons in the world that care about the happiness of prisoners, such as the Pretoria Central Prison in the Union of South Africa, which is introduced here.

This prison is the only one in the Union of South Africa that imprisons long-term European offenders. In order to enable prisoners to make use of their long-term imprisonment, the prison authorities provide them with opportunities for further education. Prisoners can read in prison, study at correspondence schools, and the prison also employs teachers, and prisoners can attend their classes.

Their goal is to participate in the open entrance examinations and degree examinations of external universities. One prisoner serving a seven-year sentence passed the entrance examination in prison and is now studying for a degree in prison. Another, also serving a seven-year sentence, already has a Bachelor of Arts degree and has been approved to study business courses, hoping to obtain a business degree in two years.

Prisoners who only have a secondary school education are diligently seeking to pass the university entrance examination. Several prisoners convicted of fraud are studying administration and business courses. One prisoner, sentenced to seven years' imprisonment for murder, arson, robbery, theft, etc., has his first goal to pass the entrance examination, and later wants to study mining and engineering in prison.

Since this prison implemented this method, order has greatly improved. Prisoners preparing for exams are willing to abide by prison rules, and their behavior is comparatively more disciplined. However, studying inevitably costs money, and many prisoners, although ambitious, are inevitably hindered by economic difficulties. The 'Prisoner Welfare Fund' can provide a portion of the subsidy, and there are also donations from outside, but it is still not enough. The biggest obstacle to this approach is still the issue of surplus money.

Although prisoners study, they still have to do ordinary prison work. They leave the prison at 7:00 a.m. to work and do not return until 5:00 p.m. There is a lunch break in between, and many prisoners make good use of this time. The prison authorities also have preferential measures for studying prisoners. The lights are usually turned off at 9:00 p.m., and prisoners have ample time to study in their cells.

This method works very well, and prisoners clearly benefit from it. Pretoria Central Prison is one of the best-managed prisons in the world, and they are now working hard to find suitable jobs for their qualified released prisoners.

### The Misfortune of the European Paradise

— Shi Shuang

Another Group that Hates the Nazis

The climate is warm, the scenery is beautiful, and every mountain and lake has a captivating charm. It is the European paradise—Switzerland, and also the ideal land of peace for people all over the world. Peace, tranquility, and beauty often fill this small country. However, after the outbreak of the Second European War, on September 5th of last year, Switzerland also quickly declared a national mobilization. Although it is a permanently neutral country, it is also a country where all people are soldiers. Guns, helmets, military uniforms, etc., are placed in every family. Therefore, as soon as the radio reported the government's call-up order, the people put on their military uniforms and rushed to report. The shortest assembly time for the troops was only two and a half hours. It has now mobilized 500,000 soldiers, a number that is certainly not large in other countries, but in Switzerland it already accounts for 12.5% of the country's population. Her main force is concentrated in Basel at the northwestern end, which is a city bordering Germany and France. The Rhine River has Germany on its right bank and France on its left bank. Switzerland straddles both banks of the Rhine. If the German and French armies both hate the frontal conflicts of the Maginot and Siegfried Lines, then they have to cross the Netherlands, Belgium, or break through Basel in the south.

Of Switzerland's four million people, seven-tenths speak German, two-tenths speak French, and those who speak Italian and Swiss dialects account for only one-tenth. Judging from this, it should be very close to Germany. However, unexpectedly, since Germany annexed Czechoslovakia last year, Switzerland has completely become anti-German. Her troops are concentrated in Basel, on the one hand, stemming from anti-German sentiments, and on the other hand, because Germany may invade Switzerland, it is very clear that the main purpose of military defense is to completely deal with Nazi countries.

The mobilized soldiers in Switzerland have a vacation once every two weeks. Returning from the border areas, one can see grassy military uniforms everywhere on the streets of Switzerland. Each soldier costs ten Swiss francs a day. Switzerland, with five hundred thousand soldiers mobilized, has to spend five million francs a day. Last year, Switzerland's military burden per person was 100 francs, but now it costs 450 francs. On the other hand, because the mobilization accounts for more than one-tenth of the population, the production capacity has to be greatly reduced, so the general Swiss petty bourgeoisie is also in a state of anxiety.

Switzerland ranks only after the United States and Britain in the total amount of gold reserves in the world. It is a world-famous "bank country." They have now transferred a portion of their gold reserves to the United States, and another portion is stored in mountain tunnels. Moreover, many shelters have been built near the tunnels, so that people will never think that there is brilliant gold underneath. At the same time, they also put food in armored vehicles and sink the armored vehicles in the center of lakes scattered throughout the country to prepare for future food shortages.

Refusing Reporters Entry

So far, Switzerland has issued more than 150 wartime decrees, many of which are related to suppressing spies. During the First World War, Switzerland simply became the center of clandestine activities for spies from various countries. This is a situation that can hinder neutrality, so Switzerland is now strictly implementing telecommunications, telephone, radio, and other communications controls, and there are stricter restrictions on foreigners entering the country. Swiss maps are generally not allowed to be carried. During the last World War, spies from various countries mixed into Switzerland under the guise of journalists. Therefore, in this European War, Switzerland ruthlessly refuses all news reporters to enter the country. Switzerland was a free country with democratic politics, but now, due to the war, it has become an unfree country.

### Construction of the Mind

— Wu Wenbin

During the Ming Dynasty, Yang Jisheng, who impeached Yan Song, once said these few words: "The mind is the master of the person's entire body, like the root of a tree, the stem of a fruit, and it is most important not to damage the mind first. If the mind contains the principles of heaven and justice, then what comes out will all be good things, and you will be on the side of the gentleman. If the mind contains human desires and selfish intentions, even if you want to do good things, there will be no beginning and no end, and even if you want to be a good person on the outside, you will be seen through, just as the root decays and the tree withers, and the stem rots and the fruit falls." These words are a penetrating criticism for those with treacherous minds. If we want to be upright people, we must first build our minds with righteousness and candor, so that we are worthy of being true people.

There was once a university student in Beiping who worked as a clerk in a foreign firm, but secretly became a kidnapper, tore up the ransom note, was arrested, and sentenced to death. In his letter to his wife, he wrote: "My crime and my death are all due to my cleverness. I hope my son will not be sent to school in the future, lest he follow in my footsteps." How absurd! Where did his cleverness mislead him? I say he himself misled his cleverness. Since you have intelligence, you must be able to control it and use it. Why did you misuse it? Undoubtedly, it is because he lacked inner cultivation. In other words, he lacked the construction of his mind, so he caused this tragic mistake! Mr. Sun Yat-sen said: "Revolution must first revolutionize the mind." This is a treatment for the symptoms. If we want to be people, we must first build the mind…so that we are not tempted by general heresies and desires.

### Alienation

— Guo Ziqing

Invisible lines string people together. So say social scientists. But I am quite amazed at the vast distance between people's feelings. One soul to another, like one planet to another. Never connected. (I can't find the tools to connect.)

So I say: "Alienation is an unavoidable existence in the world."

"No, your view is too pessimistic," a friend retorted. "First, you have to take off your colored glasses."

"Then, can you tell me what is the bridge that connects people?"

"Nothing else, just life. You can't just look for chance to cast a conclusion. But time and space often alienate people."

I fell into speechless contemplation again.

### European War Vignettes

— Chenghe

The grandson of the great Russian writer Tolstoy, Ivan Tolstoy-Bel, has joined the French Navy.

Germany has several hundred giant beasts, all of which have been shipped to Russia. These giant beasts were originally in German zoos, but now the Germans are afraid they will starve to death, so they are fostering them in Russia.

Everyone in Britain has a set of gas masks issued by the government. However, children find gas masks terrifying, so the government has specially manufactured a large number of new masks, specially distributed to babies around two years old. These masks come in several colors and look like Mickey Mouse, so their name is also called "Mickey Mouse Masks." The problem now is that the children refuse to wear them properly and treat them as toys.

"Living ghosts" have been discovered in two places in Britain. These living ghosts appear after the lights are turned off during the blackout, wearing white robes, making strange noises in their mouths, and scaring pedestrians. Many women and children have become ill as a result. These living ghosts are mostly disguised by local ruffians and hooligans. The police authorities have begun to investigate and will not forgive their pranks.

General Goering is said to be most fond of wearing medals, but recently a new batch of medals has been issued in Germany, but Goering did not receive one. This medal is specially awarded by Hitler to those who have contributed to the construction of the "West Wall" (i.e., the Siegfried Line). A total of six civil and military officials were awarded.

### The Influence of Movies on People

— Xinliang

In Mr. Shou Xun's article "Practicing the Cloth Garment Movement," I read these two sentences: Ordinary young and young mistress-style movie fans pay extraordinary attention to the clothing of movie actors and follow suit. Indeed, none of us can deny that the impact of movies on the audience is really too deep and too great. Not only in clothing can it be said to be so, even in any other behavior, hobby, or personality aspect, movies can give us a huge impact.

According to the American "Current History" magazine of a certain month last year: Young men and women in New York City, even children, have a great interest in movies. They are happy to learn the style of those red stars, wear the clothes they wear, perm the hairstyles they perm, and love everything they love.

Since Norma Shearer played in "The Barretts of Wimpole Street," every barbershop and beauty salon in New York has competed to promote the "Juliet" hairstyle that Norma wore in the film; when Claudette Colbert's "Cleopatra" was released, those crazy men and women shifted their interest to "Sasha." Similarly, clothing is also like this. The novel and glamorous clothes in "The Women" of MGM really don't know how many young people they have sensationalized.

It is said that since the release of "Robin Hood," the business of bows and arrows toys in stationery stores in New York City has unexpectedly improved. In addition, don't we often see things like "Shirley Temple Dolls," "Snow White Soap," and "Flower Girl Perfume" in department stores? Whatever the item, as long as it is crowned with the name of a movie or a star, its business will naturally flourish.

We can probably also hear sayings such as "Because Mickey Rooney likes to play ball, so I also like to play ball," etc. In short, movies can indeed change a person's life and hobbies.

Because of this, we must be very careful when shooting each film. Even if it is a very small action, an extremely unimportant paragraph, they must make it perfect before they are done.

### Secret of Success

— Jinghuan

Alice Faye's Autobiography

Alice Faye was only a third-rate actress three years ago when she was filming "Little Miss Marker," "Sing, Baby, Sing," and other films, but now she has become one of Hollywood's most famous singers. According to her, her success is due to adhering to the following eight secrets: (1) Don't underestimate your talent. (2) Don't sing high notes. (3) Forget yourself, your clothes, etc. (4) Don't panic. (5) Think before you speak. (6) Prepare the plot before filming. (7) Forget your mistakes. (8) Have confidence and courage.

### Pot of Qilu Tales

— Su Shaoqing

Yellow Crane Tower (Part 1)

The drama "Yellow Crane Tower" tells the story of the negotiations between Wu and Shu over Jingzhou. Zhou Yu invited Liu Bei to a banquet across the river, and demanded the return of Jingzhou during the banquet. Bei was at a loss for words and could only kneel down and beg. If not for Zhao Yun's eloquence and great fearless spirit, Liu Bei would have been forced to sign the treaty of Yellow Crane Tower, which would have ceded power and humiliated the country. Before leaving, Zhuge Kongming gave Zhao Yun a bamboo joint, which was Zhou Yu's order to open and read in case of extreme difficulty. (This arrow of command, Zhou Yu said to Lu Su in the play, was the order that Kongming used to borrow the wind from the South Screen and forgot to return. The loopholes in the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, or the homeless characters, are often asked and debated in society as a joke. The playwright finds this section to use as the dramatic hook, which is extremely interesting.) He then held the command and escaped. Zhou Yu was furious, and Doctor Lu was reprimanded. If the water battle and Reed Catkin Beach are also performed, it would be lively and worth watching. According to the Three Kingdoms plays performed in the play, most of the materials are taken from the Romance, but the plot of "Yellow Crane Tower" is not found in the Romance. If the play is performed by skilled performers, one person with one face, one person with one expression, and each person's personality is completely revealed, it is very good to watch. Tracing back to its origin, it all depends on the playwright's ingenious mind, and the wonderful thing is that a command arrow is hidden in the bamboo joint, which serves as the hook of the whole play. Thus, the whole play is alive, creating many interesting points. The author really knows how to write articles out of nothing.

### The Huge Momentum of "Gone With the Wind"

— Yuangu

American female writer Mitchell's world-shaking novel "Gone With the Wind" has sold more than 1.78 million copies and has been translated into sixteen languages. Moreover, the film based on this novel has already been screened in the United States.

The screening location of this film was at the Loew's Grand Theatre in Atlanta, Georgia, on December 15th of last year. On that day, the stars of the film, Clark Gable, Vivien Leigh, Leslie Howard, Olivia de Havilland, etc., paraded through the city, so the people of Atlanta and the entire state of Georgia were as excited and drunk as if they were in a dream because of this film.

This film was directed by the famous producer David O. Selznick with all his efforts. He purchased the filming rights to "Gone With the Wind" in July 1936 for $50,000. At that time, this novel had just been published. The filming rights were in hand, but who should play the main characters inside? Clark Gable's role as Rhett Butler was unanimously agreed by movie fans as the most suitable, but the role of the female lead Scarlett O'Hara was difficult to find. Many actors were not suitable. Finally, British actress Vivien Leigh toured Hollywood and was seen by Selznick, who hired her.

The director of this film was also very difficult to find. First, George Cukor was invited. This gentleman was the director of "Camille," "The Barretts of Wimpole Street," and "The Women." His technique was delicate, but lacking in grandeur. Then, Victor Fleming—the director of "Captain Courageous" and "The Wizard of Oz"—was replaced, but he and the female lead Vivien Leigh did not get along well and often quarreled, so he could not continue to serve for a long time. Finally, Sam Wood, the director of "Goodbye, Mr. Chips," was invited, and only then was he able to complete this film.

The entire film is in color and cost a total of $3.98 million. In film history, only two films have cost so much: one is the air combat film "Hell's Angels," and the other is the Jewish historical film "Ben-Hur." According to American public opinion surveys, the box office of this film will definitely break the record of "Snow White."

### New News in the Arts World

Drama Communication: Recently, a certain gentleman pioneered a drama communication agency, specializing in sending various entertainment news. Manuscripts are sent out every other day, and photos are provided. The organization is very sound, and it is scheduled to be formally established in mid-February.

Volunteer Peking Opera: The Peking Opera section of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Chinese Staff Club, in order to raise funds for adult voluntary education expenses for the Shanghai Shenzhou Night School and donations for the North China flood, is scheduled to hold three nights of volunteer performances at the Golden Theater on February 1, 2, and 3. The program is as follows: First day (February 1) "Eight Righteous Figures," "Wu Jia Slope," "The Woman Escorted," "Two Visits to the Palace," "Fen River Bend," "Heroic Righteousness"; Second day (February 2) "Stabbing the Daughter-in-Law," "Mother Xu Scolds Cao," "The Lotus Lantern," "Rainbow Pass," "The Romance of the Spring and Autumn," "Cosmic Peak," "Evil Tiger Village," Third day (February 3) "Running the City," "Playing the Flower Drum," "June Snow," "Arresting and Releasing Cao," "Hammer Shakes Four Flat Mountains," "Teaching the Son," "Three Forks." It is also learned that all the tickets, under the promotion of the initiators Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Ludeng, Xi Yushu, Jiang Yiping, and Guo Shun, have been mostly sold out.

Publication of Famous Songs: Paramount's new film "Seventeen," starring famous silver screen actor Jackie Cooper and others, will be shipped to Shanghai for public release soon. Many famous songs in the film are novel and pleasant to listen to. They are now being finely printed and published by the Yaguang Art Company, with attached simple scores. Ladies who love songs can purchase them directly from the music departments of the four major companies and various music stores.

### Leisurely Talk About the Entertainment World

— Written by Dongyun, Illustrated by Xiuyan

Southern Opera is popular in the Changshu-Wuxi area. The themes of the plays are mostly folk stories involving the love of children (such as Liang Shanbo, He Wenxiu, etc.). It doesn't seem to be "elegant," but it can't be as popular and easy to understand as "Yue Opera" and "Shen Opera." This may be the reason why "Southern Opera" cannot become popular.
