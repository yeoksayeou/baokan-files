He stayed for four months and left Moscow in January, staying in another small town for some time, and returned to China last month. Zhou's arm still needs massage treatment and he cannot write. This arm will probably not be as it used to be. Zhou will come to Chongqing soon. This trip to Moscow was purely for medical treatment. Apart from visiting a few factories and meeting with doctors and nurses in the hospital, he did not have contact with others. The Soviet people are deeply concerned about news from China.

### Counterattacking Nanchang and the War of Resistance

The Suiyuan Chinese army counterattacked and captured Wuyuan; the Hubei Chinese army counterattacked and captured Macheng; the Ganbei Chinese army counterattacked and captured Jing'an and Fengxin, and besieged Anyi, advancing on Nanchang; the Guinan Chinese army counterattacked and captured Tongzheng and Zuoxian, pressing on the outskirts of Nanning. These are the most prominent war achievements of this month. In addition, there have been fierce battles in the Changzi area of Shanxi, the Qinyang area of Henan, the Yueyang area of Hunan, and the Baoying area of Jiangsu, all of which have been able to kill the enemy and achieve results, and are recorded in the newspapers, so they will not be listed in detail. Since the beginning of spring, it has become a common phenomenon that the Chinese army has been on the offensive and the Japanese army has been on the defensive. Furthermore, a bird's-eye view of the recent development of military affairs on all sides gives the impression of a general counterattack. Those who heard this were filled with joy and ran to tell each other: "The counterattack has begun, and the day when our rivers and mountains are restored is not far away!" The news of the battle for Nanchang is the most focused on.

Nanchang is the capital of Jiangxi Province, and its gains and losses are enough to stir up attention. Now that it has been recovered, it is truly gratifying. Moreover, there will eventually be a day to recover it, and it is not only Nanchang that must be recovered in the end. In fact, in terms of military strategy and politics, the value and importance of Nanchang, which everyone expects to be recovered, is not as good as Wuyuan, which has already been recovered. Furthermore, in terms of the overall situation of the Sino-Japanese War, the problem today is not in Nanchang, nor in recovering Nanchang, but in attacking Nanchang. To say that it is in attacking Nanchang is not necessarily to say that it is in attacking; to say that it is in attacking is not necessarily to say that it is in fighting.

At the beginning of China's War of Resistance, the authorities immediately announced to the people that this war would use the strategy of consuming the enemy's strength, and that this war would inevitably endure painful sacrifices and only seek to be protracted. Three years have passed, and it is clear that the authorities have maintained an attitude that is accurate from the beginning and has not changed for a long time. The ambition and brutality of the aggressor must be directly proportional to its strength. If its strength cannot be consumed, its brutality will not stop and its ambition will not be curbed. Even if it slightly slows down its aggression, China will still have no way to achieve a definite victory and security. Furthermore, given the aggressor's premeditation and accumulation of strength, it is difficult to lightly engage its sharp edge. Therefore, it is only possible to seize time and deal with it in a circumspect manner. What cannot be won with all its strength at the moment can be won by dividing its strength over the years. Relying on infinite potential and utilizing infinite time, the aggressor has been able to experience the embarrassment of the past three years, confirming that a protracted war of resistance is the only way. Under this intention, there are principles to follow in attack, defense, advance, and retreat. As for using the excuse of pain and suffering, and making demands based on the loss of cities and land, none of this is correct. Does the aggressor not regret today that it was mistakenly trapped in China's strategy? Therefore, it is possible that it will make one or two new offensives in military terms to adapt to its various local intentions, but to complete the entire task of aggression through military means, it must awaken from its delusions and give up. What it is most eager to do is to ensure its strongholds and turn them into solid defense lines; to firmly defend its defense lines and then control the entire area within the military occupation points and lines, in order to carry out its conspiracies of annexation in political and economic terms. This can be proven by observing all its arrangements in the occupied areas. Furthermore, it can be seen from the fact that it has generally become silent in terms of military action that it no longer intends to win by offensive warfare.

Of course, China cannot allow for a misinterpretation of the War of Resistance by taking the words at face value. Otherwise, if the aggressor were to stop here, no longer wanting to attack or win, then could the resistance fighters also stop here, maintaining this stalemate for a long time? Stopping at a stalemate, neither advancing nor retreating, and even not fighting, would become a great success for the aggressor. The great meaning of the War of Resistance is not like this. The War of Resistance must win, and must win completely. It is only when the country's sovereignty and territory are restored to their integrity that it can be called a complete victory. Therefore, in recent years, the Chinese army in Suiyuan, E'dong, Ganbei, and Guinan has launched a counterattack, which is neither a counterattack against a force of aggression, nor is it a gradual restoration of the provinces of Sui, E, Gan, and Gui. Analyzing its most important significance lies in responding to the opponent's silence in military action, shaking its attempt to form lines and surfaces, canceling its possibility of long-term occupation, and reminding it of the futility of all its arrangements in the occupied areas. That's all! China will definitely have a day to recover its lost territories, but not necessarily now. It should be known that although the Sino-Japanese War has become a long-term war due to China's chances of winning, according to various inevitable reasons, the way in which China achieves final victory should not be a gradual restoration, accumulating years to the point of complete restoration. The reason is that the other side will not abandon its policy of aggression until its strength is exhausted. When its strength is not exhausted, China's main task is to promote consumption, not to seek to recover a city or a place in a hurry. The key to consuming strength lies in battle. If the aggressor no longer advances, it lies in the attack of those who resist. The day when it is exhausted by consumption will be the time when China's general counteroffensive and victory will be achieved.

### Hull Issues Statement: Dutch East Indies Must Maintain Status Quo; US Adopts Tough Policy on Far East, Warns Signatory Nations to Respect Promises

Washington: US Secretary of State Hull issued a statement yesterday saying, "Any change to the status quo of the Dutch East Indies will harm the stability, peace, and security of the Pacific." In commenting on the statement made on Sunday by Japanese Foreign Minister Hachiro Arita regarding the Dutch East Indies, Hull stated, "The East Indies are extremely important to the entire Pacific international relations." After pointing out the importance of the economic nature of the islands, he said, for the benefit of all nations, the status quo of the archipelago must be maintained. Hull stated, "I am very interested in the statement made by the Japanese Foreign Minister that the Japanese government is extremely concerned about maintaining the status quo of the Dutch East Indies. Any change to the status quo of the Dutch East Indies will directly affect the interests of many countries. The Dutch East Indies are extremely important to the entire Pacific international relations. The East Indies stretch approximately 3,200 miles from west to east, from the Indian Ocean in the west to the Pacific Ocean in the east, straddling the equator. The East Indies are also a key element of global commerce. They produce a large proportion of the world's major commodities, such as rubber, tin, quinine, copra, etc. Many countries, including the United States, need these products. Interference in the internal affairs of the Dutch East Indies or changing the status quo of the islands by non-peaceful means will not only harm the stability, peace, and security of the Dutch East Indies but will also harm the stability, peace, and security of the entire Pacific. This conclusion is based on universally accepted principles and is strongly advocated by our country. It is also included in the exchange of notes between the United States and Japan on November 30, 1908, in which the United States and Japan stated their respective policies on maintaining the status quo in the Pacific region. Subsequently, the United States, Britain, France, and Japan signed a treaty in Washington on December 13, 1921, regarding the islands and territories belonging to the countries in the Pacific region. On February 4, 1922, the four countries sent a note to the Netherlands stating, 'Each of the countries has decided to respect the rights of the Netherlands over the islands in the Pacific region.' In recent years, all peace-loving countries have sincerely requested the abandonment of the policy of force and the maintenance of peace based on major principles. These major principles include respecting the rights of other countries, not interfering in the internal affairs of other countries, granting other countries equal and fair treatment, and respecting treaty promises. Treaty revisions should be carried out in an orderly manner when necessary. The United States government has always hoped, as have other peace-loving countries, that the attitudes and policies of all countries can be based on the aforementioned principles and that these principles can be applied not only to every part of the Pacific region but also to every part of the world." (United Press, 18th)

Washington: Regarding the Dutch East Indies issue, the statement made by Japanese Foreign Minister Hachiro Arita has been recorded and sent to the State Department by the Japanese Embassy. At the same time, the US Embassy in Japan has also recorded and sent Secretary of State Hull's statement, which is a kind of response to Arita's statement, to the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. (Havas, 18th)

Washington: Secretary of State Hull's statement has been commented on by diplomatic circles, who said that although the wording is very mild, it is a clear warning to Japan and other countries that may take advantage of the Netherlands' crisis and attempt to seize the East Indies. However, examining the content of the statement, it expresses agreement with the principle of maintaining the status quo put forward by Foreign Minister Arita, but at the same time, it also clearly condemns Japan's threatening interference. It can be asserted that if Japan seeks to place the Dutch East Indies, which is also the source of industrial raw materials for the United States, under protection, the United States will immediately take various measures to deal with it. (Havas, 18th)

New York: Today, the newspapers here all put US Secretary of State Hull's warning to Japan regarding the Dutch East Indies issue at the top of the news about the European war. The newspapers' editorials all believe that Hull's statement is an indication of a hardening of the United States' Far East policy. The New York Times said, "Secretary of State Hull's quick statement of the United States' position to Japanese Foreign Minister Arita shows that the United States' policy toward the Pacific has hardened." The New York Herald Tribune said that Arita's statement, from Washington's point of view, is by no means a doubt that Britain and the United States will take action, but a justification for Japan to take the same steps as Germany. This is because Washington observes that Japan is thinking of taking advantage of Germany's occupation of the Netherlands to occupy the Dutch East Indies. (United Press, 18th)

The Hague: Although the official circles here are seeking criticism of US Secretary of State Hull's statement on the Dutch East Indies issue, the non-official circles are extremely welcoming. (United Press, 18th)

The Netherlands Resolves to Defend All Territories by Force

Paris: The Dutch government notified the Foreign Ministry here yesterday that the Netherlands will deal with any invasion of any territory of the Dutch Empire with strong force. The Dutch government also said that Japan and other signatory countries to the Washington Conference have clearly guaranteed that the Dutch East Indies will not be invaded. French sources here believe that the statement made by the Japanese Foreign Ministry expressing concern about the fate of the Dutch East Indies if the Netherlands is invaded is a tentative expression, and the Dutch government has now given the above-mentioned response, which will make Tokyo hesitate before advancing south. (United Press, 18th)

Washington: Dutch Minister Loudon recently had contact with the State Department authorities, and afterwards said that no matter who tries to place any part of our country under protection, this is not acceptable to our country. (Havas, 17th)

Tokyo: The Dutch Ambassador to Japan visited Foreign Minister Arita at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 3 pm on the 18th, and based on instructions from his government, stated that they do not want to rely on any country's protection now, nor will they rely on other countries in the future, and refuse any country's proposal for protection or interference. (Domei News Agency, 18th) Several newspapers in Washington here expressed concern about the future of the Dutch East Indies in the event that the Netherlands is drawn into the war. The Washington Post said that Japanese Foreign Minister Arita's remarks on Sunday were a unilateral declaration of Japan's development policy. If the Dutch East Indies were to adopt military and economic policies and be occupied by a country like Japan, the sources of rubber and tin supply would be endangered, which is something the United States cannot afford to ignore. The Times Herald said that it is doubtful whether the United States can protect the Dutch East Indies from Japan's determined seizure. The United States cannot even defend the Philippines, let alone the more distant Dutch East Indies. If the Netherlands cannot defend it and Britain cannot defend it, then the United States will have to stand by and do nothing. (Reuters, 17th)

Hong Kong: A Tokyo dispatch says that Foreign Minister Arita reported on the situation in Northern Europe, the attitude taken by the United States, and the position held by the Japanese government on the Dutch East Indies at the Privy Council today. (18th)

Tokyo: A Japanese naval spokesman said today that the Japanese Navy is as concerned as the Japanese government about the status quo of the Dutch East Indies, because if the status quo of the Dutch East Indies changes due to the impact of the European war, it would mean the expansion of the European war to the Far East. The spokesman also pointed out that the South Seas islands are economically very important to Japan, so the natural resources of these places must be developed by various means. Japan has no territorial demands in the South Seas. When discussing the "lightning" development of the European situation, the spokesman also said that it is needless to talk about how Japan will encounter in the near future. He also said that the United States wants to maintain the status quo of Greenland because the United States has interests there, but the United States' interests in Greenland cannot be compared to Japan's interests in the Dutch East Indies.

### US Congress to Pass Naval Expansion Bill; Admiral Stark Reaffirms Request to Increase Strength by 25%; New 35,000-Ton Battleship to Be Launched in June

Washington: The Vinson Bill, which stipulates an 11% increase in the US Navy, seems certain to be approved by the Naval Affairs Committee and submitted to the Senate. It is said that the US Navy originally planned to increase by 25%, but the reason for the reduction to 11% is entirely because the arsenals cannot manufacture cannons exceeding the increased 11% within the timeframe of the Vinson Bill. News from Japan that the country is building super battleships will undoubtedly help the passage of the US naval expansion bill in Congress. However, well-informed sources do not believe that Japan can complete the shipbuilding process as rumored. (Reuters, 18th)

Washington: US Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Stark told the Senate Naval Affairs Committee yesterday that it would cost US$3,486,000,000 to make the US Navy the largest in the world. Stark reaffirmed his request to increase the strength of the US Navy by 25%. It is said that the maximum tonnage of future battleships seems to be limited to 40,000 tons. In the past six months, naval authorities have been vigorously studying the construction of battleships, from 40,000 tons to 70,000 tons. (United Press, 18th)

Washington: US Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Stark delivered a speech to the Senate Naval Affairs Committee, advocating the expansion of the Navy and Air Force. He mentioned the success of the German Air Force in the Norwegian campaign. He declared that German Junkers aircraft transported 2,000 German soldiers to Norway from Denmark every day. He insisted that the Navy should have the assistance of the Air Force. He demanded the construction of the "world's strongest navy." The Navy's supplementary program stipulates the construction of three aircraft carriers, totaling 85,600 tons, fourteen cruisers, totaling 275,000 tons, sixty-eight destroyers, totaling 242,830 tons, and thirty-six submarines, totaling 57,856 tons. (Haitong News Agency, 18th)

New York: Rear Admiral Woodward, commander of the Third Naval District of the naval shipyard, announced yesterday that the new 35,000-ton battleship "North Carolina" will be launched on June 13th. This is the first giant ship built by the United States in nineteen years. Rear Admiral Woodward said in a speech yesterday that the United States should expand its unparalleled naval and air power, "At the current rate of shipbuilding, the US Navy will be relegated to second place." (United Press, 18th)

Tokyo: When a spokesman for the Navy Department received reporters today, someone asked about the news published in the US newspapers that the Japanese Navy was building sixteen super battleships. The spokesman replied that although he could not say anything about Japan's shipbuilding program, his impression was that this was deliberately propagated by the US Navy faction on the eve of the Senate's discussion of the naval budget bill in order to obtain as much funds as possible for the construction of a huge US fleet. The spokesman also said that it was regrettable that the United States had made such a fuss about Japan's shipbuilding program, because if the country correctly understood Japan's naval policy based on non-aggression, it would not have such untrue rumors. (Reuters, 18th)

### Suma's Speech: Policy Towards China

Tokyo: Suma, Director of the Information Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, recently gave a speech to the masses at the Osaka City Central Lecture Hall. He said that Japan is not concerned about other foreign events other than the "China Incident." Therefore, it can be said that Japan's policy is purely aimed at resolving the "China Incident." In other words, the policy towards China is also Japan's world policy. As for the establishment of the "Wang Jingwei regime," it does not mean the end of the "China Incident." Japan must maintain a patient attitude towards China for several years to come, and the true resolution of the "China Incident" must also wait for several years. (Havas, 17th)

### Chiang Wei-kuo Arrives in the US to Study Aviation; American Reporters Host the President, Invited Him as a Guest of Honor

Washington Correspondence: Chiang Wei-kuo, the second son of Chinese Chairman Chiang, has recently arrived in the United States and is currently studying American aviation affairs and learning to fly. He is 22 years old and received military training in the German Army for some time. When the European war broke out, he decided to leave Germany and travel to the Netherlands, Belgium, and France. After arriving in the United States, he traveled all over the country by plane, train, and car, making a 10,000-mile journey. Now he is focusing on studying aeronautics, and is fluent in English, German, and other languages. When the White House Correspondents Association held its annual banquet to entertain the US President and his cabinet members, Chiang Wei-kuo was invited as a guest of honor, and had the opportunity to meet and chat with the American head of state and others.

### Britain and France Plan to Strictly Prevent Contraband from Being Transported to Germany via the Pacific; Trade at Vladivostok Increases Greatly

London: According to London official sources, the Allied Powers will adopt strict plans to prevent contraband from being transported to Soviet ports via the Pacific and then to Germany. According to all the latest figures, since the start of the war, trade at the port of Vladivostok has increased greatly, unusually. The increase is not only higher than the total imports of all Soviet ports before the war but also exceeds the Soviet Union's own needs. It can be seen that Germany is now systematically transporting foreign supplies through this route. In 1938, the United States did not ship rubber, tin, or copper to the Soviet Union, and only 50 tons of copper were traded. But in the period from September 1939 to March 1940, the United States shipped 67,000 tons of copper, 6,000 tons of rubber, 2,200 tons of tin, 1,600 tons of aluminum, and 6 million pounds to the Soviet Union. Since February of this year, the United States has tried to prevent rubber and tin from being shipped to the Soviet Union. In addition to rubber and tin shipped from the United States, most of the rubber and tin from the Dutch East Indies first went to Mexico and then transshipped to Vladivostok. Recently, a batch of tin from the Dutch East Indies was loaded onto a ship and transported to the Staten Island Free Port in New York, and then shipped to Vladivostok. The ships transporting these goods are from the United States, Japan, Italy, Norway, and the Soviet Union. Germany also plans to transport smaller items with higher value, such as surveying instruments and paints, from Vladivostok to various places. (Reuters, 18th)

### Mussolini's Mouthpiece, Gayda, Attacks British and French Mediterranean Policy; Fang Government Denies Designating Bali Port as a Military Zone; Rumors Spread of Joint Italian-German Action

Rome: Gayda, the mouthpiece of Italian Premier Mussolini, published an article in the Italian Daily today, attacking Britain's plan to dominate the Mediterranean, saying that Britain has always pursued a policy in the Mediterranean aimed at maintaining its power and superiority in an extremely strong form, solely for the benefit of its empire. Since the conclusion of the Treaty of Versailles, Britain and France have vigorously prevented Italy's expansion in the Mediterranean. However, no matter what Britain demands from the Mediterranean, Britain is not a Mediterranean country after all. Its only legitimate demand is nothing more than a direct route to its territory. (Reuters, 18th)

Rome: Today's Italian official statement denies that Bali Port has been declared part of the war zone and denies the news that the Italian government has increased the conscription of fourth-class reserve soldiers. However, it stated that several thousand soldiers have been conscripted recently. (Haitong News Agency, 18th)

London: Diplomatic circles here are paying close attention to the development of the situation in Italy. The country's decision to designate Bali Port on the Adriatic coast as a military zone and prohibit tourists from going there is particularly valued. In addition, as reported by Germany, Italy conscripted fourth-class reserve soldiers into the army this morning. As reported by the Yugoslavian radio station last night, part of the Turkish fleet sailed to the Aegean Sea. All these things are disturbing. As for Britain's attitude towards Italy, it has been explained by Cross, Minister of Economic Warfare. (Havas, 18th)

Rome: The port of Bali in the Adriatic Sea has been declared a restricted area. The port is located 69 miles northwest of Brindisi. (Reuters, 18th)

Washington: According to reliable information from diplomatic circles here, German troops have been ordered to move along the southern border, and the so-called "sleeper cells" of the "Fifth Column" have deeply infiltrated the southern border. Many well-informed State Department experts believe that if the plan for joint Italian-German action is realized, the Italian army will inevitably pass through the southern country to Turkey's gateway, so as to contain Turkey and eliminate the threat of the Allied forces in Syria. (International News Service, 18th)

London: People in diplomatic and parliamentary circles in this question whether Italy is willing to maintain its neutrality. It is said that people originally believed that the country should stay out of the current war, but now they no longer think so. If Germany really wants Italy to join forces with it to fight against Britain and France, it is questionable whether Italy can maintain its neutrality for a long time. Although political figures say that Italy may not take action immediately, since the German invasion of Northern Europe, Italian newspapers have unanimously advocated for Germany. From this point of view, the country may eventually be dragged into the vortex one day. For example, if Germany advances into Hungary, Italy, as a member of the Rome-Berlin Axis, has the de facto necessity to send troops to maintain the balance of power between the two sides. If so, its military action will inevitably target Yugoslavia. Since the security of Greece has been formally guaranteed by Britain and France, Italy has to target the southern country. As far as Britain and France are concerned, although they have not accepted guarantees for the southern country, if Italy invades that country, it is no different from turning against Britain and France. Although it is hoped that this will not happen, Italian Premier Mussolini will inevitably lose his freedom of action one day. Therefore, Britain and France and other countries along the Mediterranean coast have already taken various precautionary measures to cope with this possible development. (Havas, 17th)

### French Military Commissioner Arrives in Ankara to Discuss with Turkish General Staff

Ankara: According to today's news, a certain French military commissioner arrived here from Syria today and began discussions with the Turkish General Staff. This happened after the British envoys to the Near East returned to Turkey and the Balkans from the London conference. It shows that Britain and France will adopt a new policy towards Germany. Some predict that this policy of Britain will have a major impact on Germany's military actions in southeastern Europe. (United Press, 18th)

### Cross Demands that Italy Properly Maintain Its Neutrality; Expresses Deep Sympathy for the Situation of Sweden

London: Minister of Economic Warfare Cross said in a speech in Sheffield last night that Italy would probably want other countries to treat it as a neutral country. If so, Britain should demand that it do so properly. However, the editorials of the country's newspapers have recently been quite hostile to Britain. Therefore, we must examine what the country's true attitude towards our country is. We have no grievances against the country and we sincerely hope to maintain friendly relations with it. But what exactly the relationship between the two countries is, is also something we want to frankly reveal. As far as the general situation of the European war is concerned, Germany may attack Sweden next month. Because on the Western Front, Hitler is blocked by France's "steel wall" and dare not pounce. After that, he will probably only annex small neutral countries and seize resources to attack British shipping. But British troops have landed in Narvik, Norway. It is impossible for Germany to obtain iron ore from Sweden. We express our deep sympathy for the situation of Sweden. Therefore, when it is attacked by other countries, we are prepared to provide assistance. But the country is also well aware of the crisis and is preparing to avoid being caught off guard and taken advantage of by other countries. As far as economic warfare is concerned, it is of course impossible to win a complete victory anytime and anywhere, but we must gradually tighten the blockade to exhaust Germany and then stop. Although economic warfare is not enough to determine the final victory or defeat, that is, the final victory or defeat must be determined by repeated fierce attacks by the army, economic warfare can indeed help the army to win easily, because it can shorten the war period and reduce the sacrifice of hundreds of thousands of our troops, which is also the truth. (Havas, 18th)

### Japanese Government Presents Gift to Lloyd George: An Ancient Porcelain Piece

The Aviation Department announced, "Several of our bombers flew to Trondheim, Norway, last night and bombed the local airfield with heavy bombs. The area was immediately seen to catch fire. Afterwards, they flew to a nearby enemy seaplane base and dropped bombs." Observers commented that the British aircraft bombing of the Stavanger airfield has not been a one-time occurrence, but the bombing of the Trondheim airfield was the first time. (Havas dispatch, 17th)

Stockholm, according to private sources, the German 26,000-ton battleship "Hokantot" has run aground in Rissa Bay, Trondheim, Norway, with the stern submerged. In addition, a German cruiser has also run aground in Trondheim. (Havas dispatch, 17th)

Oslo, according to German pilots, they witnessed an air battle at Daverger, but the plane they were on was carrying important intelligence documents and could not participate in the battle. At that time, three British planes were shot down in the first wave, and five in the second. There were no losses for the German planes. (Haitong dispatch, 18th)

Stockholm, a person named Cott, who had just arrived here from Norway, told a Reuters reporter that the German battleship Scharnhorst, after being damaged, is now docked in the Rissa River near Troheim, with the stern submerged in the water. Also, a German cruiser ran aground in the port of Troheim, and three other destroyers were also docked in the port. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)

London, the German wireless station broadcast a message from the German military headquarters, claiming that German aircraft bombed the west coast of Norway yesterday and hit a British cruiser with a heavy bomb, sinking it immediately. Other British cruisers were also heavily damaged and may not be able to return to British ports. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)

London, residents of several cities on the southeast coast heard loud artillery and bombing sounds at 10 p.m. last night. People generally believed that this was due to an air battle at sea. However, no aircraft were found in the sky, and no air raid alarms were issued, so it is unknown whether the artillery fire came from warships. In addition, the authorities of a certain city sent police to patrol the streets yesterday and advised residents to take refuge in air raid shelters. (Havas dispatch, 18th)

New York, the New York Times reported that, according to intelligence received by the Washington official circles, Germany only has 18,000 soldiers in Norway, and their transport ships are currently blocked in Denmark due to the activities of Allied mines, aircraft, and submarines. Germany originally intended to send 30,000 troops, but 8,000 soldiers have been lost due to the sinking of transport ships. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)

### German Claims: Occupation of Norwegian Railways; German Naval Commander Killed in Norway; Kongsvinger Falls to German Forces

Berlin, according to military experts here, German forces are continuing to advance in southern and central Norway, have occupied important railways, and have received reinforcements. The position has been consolidated. The situation in Narvik is unchanged. Rumors that British troops have landed in Narvik are untrue. The British Navy shelled the streets and harbor of Narvik on the evening of the 16th, but did not land troops. The British landing site is near Hasstad on Hinnoey Island, about 60 kilometers from Narvik. The German troops in Narvik advanced along the railway towards the Swedish border, defeating the Norwegian army and capturing six officers and 145 soldiers. More than 200 Norwegian soldiers fled to Sweden. This railway for transporting iron ore is now entirely in German hands. (Haitong dispatch, 18th)

Berlin, according to responsible sources here, all four railways from Norway to Sweden are now in German hands. Norway is mountainous and transportation is inconvenient, so the occupation of the railways is of great significance. The Norwegian army put up a strong resistance when the German troops occupied the railways. The railway transporting iron ore from Narvik to the Swedish border was occupied after a fierce battle. The railway from Trondheim via Meraker to the Swedish border was also completely occupied after the German troops occupied Grosa Mao. The railway from Oslo to Sweden has been taken over by German troops after the occupation of Kongsvinger. The railway between Oslo, Frederickstad, Halden, and Cronsey was also occupied by German troops after fierce fighting. (Haitong dispatch, 18th)

London, a Reuters military correspondent said that the important factor in military operations in Norway is speed. German troops are now consolidating their positions in the Oslo area in order to shift their attention to the Allied counter-offensive. The German troops' occupation of Kongsvinger yesterday is of great value to the German side, because Oslo is now isolated from the north, and its rear is the Swedish border, so German troops can now avoid being attacked from both sides. At present, general attention will be shifted to western Norway, as Allied forces have landed on the coast. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)

Stockholm, according to news received here this afternoon, the town of Namsos, about 160 kilometers north of Trondheim, Norway, was occupied by German troops today. Namsos is located in northern Norway and has a railway from Trondheim to the Swedish border. (Haitong Agency dispatch, 18th)

Oslo, according to information obtained here, King Haakon of Norway is currently in Sattel, 15 kilometers north of Elverum. The people in the German-occupied areas all hope that the king will return to the capital today. (Haitong Agency dispatch, 18th)

Paris, according to a telegram from Stockholm, British forces have now completely controlled the city of Narvik and inflicted a major blow on the retreating German troops. These German troops would rather flee to the Swedish side to be detained than be captured by the British.

Berlin, the German High Command issued a war report today, stating that the British forces in Narvik are weak. Yesterday, the first attempt to land at Hanje Bay near Elvergeadesmond was repulsed by our troops. British aircraft bombed Trondheim yesterday, but failed to achieve their goal due to the effective defense of the German Air Force. There was quietness in the Jurgen area yesterday. Stavanger was bombed by British warships yesterday morning, and four German aircraft were damaged by shrapnel. Our troops immediately dispatched aircraft to bomb the British warships, dropping heavy bombs and sinking the ship. At the same time, two British aircraft were shot down by our troops in the Stavanger area. In the Oslo area, our troops advanced north as planned and reached the vicinity of Kongsvinger. Yesterday, our aircraft bombed two Norwegian torpedo boats northeast of Arendal, one of which was hit and damaged, and the crew fled ashore. On the western front, enemy forces attacked southwest of Saarbrücken, and our troops inflicted heavy casualties and repulsed them. (Haitong dispatch, 18th)

Berlin, according to the German News Agency, there is absolutely no basis for the claim that British troops have entered Narvik. The situation in Narvik has not changed. The German military headquarters also announced that the German naval commander stationed in Narvik, Pender, was killed when British forces attacked the port. The German News Agency continued to report that the German destroyer fleet in Narvik fiercely attacked a large-scale British naval force, causing heavy losses to the British Navy. The British forces suffered the loss of several warships before sending a large fleet to continue the attack, and the German commander Pender was heroically sacrificed in this battle. (United Press dispatch, 18th)

London, a Reuters military correspondent claimed that after the German invasion of Denmark and Norway, the entire western front has been filled with active atmosphere. Military operations on the western front are a test of the commanders' brains and creativity, and the staff's imagination and actions. The routine operations of fortress warfare have been replaced by alert temporary actions. The Allies have more experience with this kind of tactics than the German army. Regarding Norway, Stavanger is still the enemy's "eyes" so far, and the primary goal of the British attack is to destroy the area at sea with firepower, which is not easy. Low-freeboard warships equipped with high-angle guns may be used. When the German army cannot use Daverger, the first phase of the Allied plan in Norway will be completed. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)

### Danube River International Navigation Supervision Issues; Romania, Hungary, Yugoslavia, and Bulgaria Form Agreement

Belgrade, Yugoslavia The Danube River International Navigation Committee recently held a meeting here and immediately passed a resolution, the points of which are as follows: (1) Any ship that can be converted into a military vessel is not allowed to navigate on the Danube River.

Rome, after Romania, Hungary, Yugoslavia, and Bulgaria established an agreement on the issue of Danube River navigation supervision, Italian figures unanimously praised it, saying that this proposal originated from the Romanian government's initiative and is the starting point for the four countries to jointly maintain peace in Southeastern Europe. The Fascist Party's Work Report stated that this agreement is of unusual importance. Romania, Hungary, Yugoslavia, and Bulgaria have historically found it difficult to cooperate. The establishment of this agreement during a time of tense international situation is truly an initiative. The Italian Daily reported that the goal of Italy's current foreign policy is to try to avoid any party's excessive concern for Southeastern Europe and absolutely non-peaceful intervention. Therefore, it expresses great approval for the agreement established by Romania, Hungary, Yugoslavia, and Bulgaria. (Havas dispatch, 17th)

London, after the International Management Committee of Danube River Navigation held a meeting in the capital of Yugoslavia and established an agreement on the issue of the safety of navigation on the river, political figures here have had a good impression and stated that this agreement is extremely beneficial to maintaining peace in Southeastern Europe. It is not only extremely important in terms of economics and navy, but also from a political point of view, the Balkan Peninsula countries have also demonstrated that these countries are willing to defend common rights within their territorial waters and ensure that Danube River hunger transport is not affected by the belligerent countries, which is also extremely important.

On the other hand, Germany has obtained war and food materials, thereby strengthening its rear situation." (TASS dispatch, 18th)

### Romanian Opposition Leader Accepts Royal Decree; Romanian Government Restricts Foreign Nationals

Bucharest, Mihalache, the former chairman of the opposition National Peasant Party, had an audience with King Carol II today, and was immediately appointed as a member of the Privy Council by the King. Therefore, he must join the National Renaissance Front and completely abandon his past prejudices. Observers said that since the government dissolved all political parties and organized the only political party, the "National Renaissance Front," Mihalache has consistently refused to cooperate. Although he is a senator, he would rather give up his political career than follow the tide because, according to the new regulations, all senators must wear the uniform of the "National Renaissance Front" in order to attend Parliament. However, his ability to change his original intention and accept the King's appointment this time is of a very important nature. Observers also said that when a cabinet crisis occurred last November, the King did once invite Mihalache to form a cabinet, but he politely declined, and then invited Tătărescu to form a cabinet.

Although newspapers say that this kind of method will never succeed in the Netherlands, the police are checking all foreign nationals. The police are paying special attention to cafes and hostels, as well as gatherings of the National Socialist Party. Special attention is being paid to the National Socialist Party's plan to hold a meeting in Norway to celebrate Hitler's birthday.

Zhu Jianfei was exhausted. Finally, he met the young player Zhou Kegang and decided to win the championship. Zhou's skills were inferior to Qian and the other two. The crowd thought that Lu's victory was as easy as turning his hand. Who knew that at the beginning of the competition, Zhou Xiao Jiang had great potential. He led the way and won the first game. In the second game, Zhou's cut ball still occupied the harassing situation. When the battle reached seven to four, Lu was greatly discolored, and then changed his strategy, relying on his calm attitude, the score also changed from behind to catch up, and finally tied a game with eleven to eight. Lu did not dare to take it lightly when the third game started, and Zhou was also cautious. The race was quite tense. Lu finally won with eleven to seven and won two to one later. In the fourth game, Zhou had no intention of fighting, and Lu sailed smoothly and ended with eleven to six. In conclusion, Lu defeated Zhou Kegang with three to one and won the group championship.

### The Municipal Council Directors Took Office Yesterday; All Parties Expect New Facilities; Ke Ziwei and Kanae Elected as Chairman and Vice Chairman; It is Expected That the Improvement of People's Livelihood Will Have Good Plans

The new directors of the current Municipal Council held an inauguration ceremony in the Municipal Council Building yesterday morning. The Chinese directors Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Ludeng, Jiang Yiping, Guo Shun, and Xi Yushu, the British directors Ke Ziwei, Hailai, Rotrik McDonald, Mi Qier, and Bao Huier, the American director Aleman Kanae, and only one Japanese director, Hagiwara Yutaro, attended. Tian Cheng was in Tokyo and did not attend. After the new directors held the inauguration ceremony, they immediately elected the chairman and vice chairman of the current Municipal Council. As a result, Ke Ziwei was elected as the chairman, and Mr. Kanae was elected as the vice chairman. Finally, a photo was taken and the meeting was dismissed.

Brief Biographies of the New Chairman and Vice Chairman

(1) Mr. Ke Ziwei is the manager of Jardine Matheson, a member of the British Chamber of Commerce, and has been in Shanghai for 14 years. He has served as a director of the Municipal Council since 1936 until now. When Mr. Fan Keling, the chairman of the Municipal Council, took leave last year, his duties were performed by Mr. Ke. His grandfather and father both served in the Municipal Council for many years. Mr. Ke's election as chairman this time is the first Englishman to be chairman of the Municipal Council in many years since Arnold. (2) Mr. Kanae is the deputy manager of the Shanghai office of Mobil Oil Company. He has been doing business in Shanghai for more than 20 years. He served as a director of the Municipal Council for three years, and only resigned due to illness in winter. Now, Mr. Kanae has been elected as the vice chairman because he has a longer history and outstanding achievements in serving in the Municipal Council than others.

It is Widely Rumored That the Japanese Director Tian Cheng Resigned

As for the Japanese director Tian Cheng, chairman of the "China Railway Company," it was learned yesterday that he had the intention of submitting his resignation before taking office. Yesterday, the Japanese Continental News claimed that Tian Cheng had the opinion of resigning, but the reason for the resignation could not be learned. The newspaper repeated that Tian Cheng's resignation had a great impact on the Japanese community, which was enough to shake people's hearts. However, this matter can only be decided after Tian Cheng returns to Shanghai from Tokyo. According to the Japanese, if Tian Cheng resigns, his successor will be Okamoto Kazusaku, because Tian Cheng received 5,025 votes in this election, and Okamoto Kazusaku received 5,023 votes, only two votes apart, and Okamoto also has considerable prestige among the Japanese in Shanghai. According to another aspect, the motive for Tian Cheng's resignation this time is that the Japanese were miserably defeated in this election, and Okamoto Kazusaku was originally a director of the Municipal Council, but he was defeated this time, and Tian Cheng is a "new Japanese" who came to Shanghai after the outbreak of the war. He knows the situation in Shanghai as well as Okamoto Kazusaku, so Tian Cheng's resignation clearly has the intention of giving way to the worthy.

All Parties Expect the New Directors Eagerly

The post-war concession administration is special and difficult due to the environment, and it is very different from the past. Under this extraordinary situation, all parties have higher expectations for the new directors. All parties hope that the directors should do their best to maintain the rights and interests of the Municipal Council, no matter what difficulties they encounter, and that the soaring prices affect people's livelihood, and should be improved as soon as possible. The whole city hopes that the suppression of profiteers and the prevention of hoarding and speculation should be implemented vigorously.

Changes in the Municipal Council Office

The Municipal Council's General Office, which was located in the east of the Municipal Council Building, has now been moved to the north, namely the former office of the president Fei Xindun. The British Deputy Director General Ge Bo and the current President and Director General Fei Lipu are working together, and the offices of the Chinese Deputy Director General He Dekui, the Japanese Deputy Director General Yabashuku, and the Secretary General Nashu are still located in the east. The Chairman's office has been changed to the former Ge Bo office.

Mr. Fulan Shan Is About to Retire

The British director of the Municipal Council's Information Office, Fulan Shan, has served in the bureau for more than ten years. He succeeded Mr. Saiya as the director of the Information Office for seven years. It is now heard that Mr. Fu will retire on the first of next month, and the new director will be succeeded by the British Oknal. Mr. Yu is now working in the Information Office.

Concession Administration Must Be Improved

The Miller Review, which will be published tomorrow, will have an editorial saying that the Japanese have been completely defeated in this Municipal Council director election, and the situation in Shanghai is becoming more tense as a result. The author firmly believes that although Shanghai residents agree that the concession administration needs to be improved, they are determined not to do it through the hands of the Japanese, as if to achieve this goal. It also said that in any city occupied by the Japanese, the corruption of the Japanese political succession has been an undeniable fact. Shanghai residents only need to go to the "bad land" in the Shanghai West Beyond Road area (that is, the area under the jurisdiction of the Japanese and the puppet authorities) for an inspection to believe what he said is true.

Changes in the Municipal Council Office

Ke Dejun, the information expert of the German Embassy in China, routinely entertained news reporters at the International Hotel at 5 pm yesterday. Fei Zongzhi, secretary of the embassy, ​​Jiao Huafu, Jiang Zhaofeng, and more than 30 reporters from various newspapers attended. During the meeting, Ke Dejun talked about his satisfaction and gratitude for the election of German overseas Chinese to serve as members of the Economic Committee Inspection Committee at this year's Western taxpayer conference, and considered it the first step in implementing "internationalization."

### The "Special Police" Issue; Consultation Today; There Is a Saying That It Will Be Resolved Within a Week

According to reliable sources, the chief inspector of the Police Department of the Municipal Council, Mr. Bowen, told reporters yesterday that the "Special Police Team for Beyond the Road in West Shanghai" may be announced within the next three weeks. It is said that the Municipal Council is represented by Bowen and Smith, and the puppet government is represented by Lu Ying and his Japanese advisor, Colonel Lan Cui, and it is stipulated that meetings will be held twice a week to discuss all the ways to solve difficult problems. He also said that this afternoon, the two sides will hold a meeting in the area north of the Suzhou River to continue the points discussed last weekend and exchange opinions. The organization of the special police for the construction of roads beyond the boundaries of West Shanghai is based on the police agreement signed between the Municipal Council and the puppet government in February this year. At that time, the Municipal Council, in view of the police affairs of the so-called bad land, often caused conflicts and disputes under the dual jurisdiction of the bureau and the puppet government, and the puppet government alone could not maintain the order of the construction of roads beyond the boundaries, so there was a double cooperative nature of the organization "Special Police" to solve various difficulties.

### The Qingpu Road Battle is Expanding - The Situation in Western Shanghai is Tense - Japanese Troops Continue to Kill and Injure Civilians - Puppet Troops on the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway are Disarmed and Detained

In recent days, dense machine gun fire and continuous artillery fire have been heard every night in the western suburbs of Shanghai, continuing throughout the night. According to people from Beixinjing, the clear sounds of gunfire are from Chinese guerilla forces engaging the Japanese forces in areas such as Panlong, Huangdu, Jiwangmiao, Qibao, Sijing, and elsewhere. These engagements are more intense than in previous days, and the sounds are especially clear late at night.

Injured Women and Children Come to Shanghai at Night

According to the English-language North China Daily News, guerilla warfare is fierce along the Qingpu Road in western Shanghai. A woman and a four-year-old boy have been injured by stray bullets and sent to the Tongren Hospital on Avenue Dubail for treatment. The two were aboard a sampan on the night of the 14th or 15th, moored at Xiaobang when fighting suddenly broke out all around them, with bullets flying everywhere. The woman's left arm was fractured by a bullet, and the boy was hit in the right thigh. Relatives drove the sampan slowly to Shanghai, and after docking at Lincoln Road this morning, they called the Fire Brigade ambulance at 10:30 AM to take them to the hospital.

Japanese Troops Have Been Killing for Five Days

Reports from various sources indicate that the fighting on the Qingpu Road involves the puppet troops under Xu, in conjunction with Japanese forces stationed in Huangdu, Qibao, Beixinjing, Jiwangmiao, and Xujing, as well as a large detachment of Japanese cavalry drawn from Jiangwan. They are encircling and attacking the area where Gu's troops are stationed. Gu's troops are responding calmly with mobile tactics, killing a considerable number of Japanese and puppet soldiers. The Japanese and puppet soldiers, unwilling to accept defeat, are venting their anger on the local farmers, resulting in hundreds of deaths daily. This search and kill operation has been going on for five days. Now, the New Fourth Army from the Nanjing-Shanghai line has arrived in the area and is launching attacks alongside Gu's troops, throwing the local Japanese and puppet forces into panic, especially Xu's troops.

Puppet Troops in Suzhou Forced to Disarm

According to people from Suzhou, recently two or three hundred puppet troops were sent to the Suzhou area, but the Japanese suddenly surrounded them with artillery fire and forced them to disarm. As a result, over thirty puppet soldiers were killed or wounded, and two or three hundred rifles were confiscated. All puppet officers, large and small, were detained.

### Strike at the Shanghai Gas Company Still Unresolved Yesterday - Employer's Reply Unsatisfactory to Employees - Slowdown Spreads After Resumption of Work

All Chinese employees of the British-owned Shanghai Gas Company, after failing to get the company to improve their compensation, began a slowdown the day before yesterday. The workers have made seven demands, and the staff has made five demands, which were sent to the company's manager, Brown, and chief engineer, Thomson. Brown and others accepted them and forwarded them to the board of directors. All employees are awaiting the company's response. According to a reporter from the Pingming News Agency, after this incident occurred, the Shanghai Municipal Council's Industrial Section, considering it a matter of public concern, intervened and urged all employees not to take extreme measures and to resume work first. The employees followed the advice and resumed work at 2:00 PM yesterday. The company also convened a board meeting at the same time to seek a resolution.

Reply to Workers

Yesterday afternoon, the company's board of directors met to discuss the various demands made by the employees. Afterwards, the company's representatives responded to the workers' seven demands as follows: (1) Increase wages by 30%; (2) If the price of rice is above 20 yuan, the company should provide rice subsidies at the highest price; if it is below 20 yuan, the company can cancel the rice subsidies; (3) The company should increase wages by 10% annually; (4) Wages should be paid during holidays; (5) Workers should not be dismissed arbitrarily without special fault; (6) If the employer wants to dismiss a worker, they should give six months' severance pay, and savings should also be calculated; (7) Year-end bonuses should be paid at one month's salary. The company's response to the above demands was as follows: (1) The company would only increase wages by 7.5%; (2) The company did not accept, and the workers offered a concession, requesting that rice subsidies of 17.5 yuan be provided if the price of rice is above 20 yuan, but the company still did not accept this; (3) and (4) The company did not accept either of these demands; (5) The company accepted; (6) The company did not accept; (7) The company would give workers a year-end bonus of half a month's salary for service of one to ten years, and one month's salary for service of over ten years.

Reply to Staff

The company authorities also responded to the five demands made by the Chinese staff, namely: (1) Increase subsidies to 50%; (2) If the price of rice exceeds 20 yuan, the company must subsidize one-half; (3) Request annual salary increases; (4) Three weeks of annual leave should be granted; (5) For savings, the company should give an additional 10% of salary each month, with compound interest calculated at 6% every six months. The company's response to the above demands was as follows: (1) The company would only increase it to 30%; (2) If the price of rice exceeds 20 yuan, the company would only give a maximum rice subsidy of 7 yuan; (3) Annual salary increases would be one-third of the monthly salary; (4) Staff with salaries above 100 yuan and service of over ten years can get two weeks of annual leave; (5) Savings would be calculated at half a month's salary for each year of service and the last salary amount prior to retirement.

Another Slowdown

The employees expressed dissatisfaction with the board's reply and resumed the slowdown, because the board of directors only offered a 7.5% increase for the workers' first demand of a 30% wage increase, and the company could only offer a 30% increase for the staff's demand for a 50% increase. Therefore, the employees convened a meeting to discuss how to respond, and as a result, they first sent a letter to the company authorities, stating their difficulties and that it was difficult to maintain a living in the face of rising prices. It is heard that the slowdown has now spread to the Yangshupu gas plant and the coal gas plant, where all the employees have responded to the head office and joined the slowdown yesterday afternoon, submitting the same demands as the head office employees to the company.

Difficult Living

According to an employee of the company, Mr. So-and-so, speaking to a reporter from the Pingming News Agency, the company's launch of the slowdown was a last resort, because the company has been established for more than 70 years, and the Chinese employees have always been extremely loyal in their service. This unfortunate incident occurred because of the recent high prices of goods in Shanghai, and monthly salaries are simply not enough to maintain a living. The company has annual profits, so they were forced to make legitimate demands to the company authorities.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Considers Compensation for Chinese Employees

Chief Inspector Bowen of the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department told reporters yesterday that the issue of increasing salaries for Chinese employees of the SMC was raised for discussion at the annual meeting of Western ratepayers. Before the 1940 budget was passed that day, Mr. Reykin, an American, gave a speech on the salaries of Chinese constables. He believed that the salaries and subsidies they currently receive are simply not enough to have any surplus each month, especially for those with large families. He said that the average salary of each constable is currently 32 yuan per month, with other subsidies amounting to only 6 yuan. Bowen said that the special nature of this matter should be given serious consideration, but the SMC's expenditure details must also be taken into account. Another police officer said that the compensation of Chinese constables is actually lower than that of police in other parts of China. He said that in addition to subsidies, the salary of each constable ranges from 21 to 50 yuan per month.

### Norwegian Ships on the Far East Route Ordered to Concentrate in Hong Kong - Three Norwegian Ships in Shanghai Sail Empty to Hong Kong - Shipping Issues to be Decided Soon

Recently, with the expansion of the European war, Denmark has been occupied by Germany, and part of Norway has also been attacked. Overseas trade in these two countries has become problematic, and shipping companies are the first to be affected. It is said that Danish ships in Hong Kong have been detained, and Danish ships in Shanghai have also stopped sailing. As for Norwegian merchant ships, it was previously reported that sailing south of Hong Kong had been suspended, but the Shanghai-Hong Kong route was still operating as usual. Yesterday, it was learned that Norwegian ships have also been ordered to concentrate in Hong Kong.

Norwegian Ships in Shanghai

There are only three ships currently. The Hua Lun Shipping Company's "Savigen" sailed empty to Hong Kong yesterday morning to await orders. The "Lairagsagen" will also sail to Hong Kong within days. The "Wilford," managed by Jebsen & Co., originally scheduled to load a large quantity of corn in Shanghai and transport it to Longkou on the 12th, has cancelled the export due to the above-mentioned impact. It is now known that the goods that have already been loaded on the ship will be unloaded and stored in the Longmao Warehouse in Pudong. The ship will then sail to Hong Kong after the goods are unloaded. As for the Norwegian shipping issue, the manager of Hua Lun Shipping Company has been discussing it with the consulate every day recently, but there has been no result. Whether to suspend or continue sailing should be decided within the next two days. It is heard that several ships in Saigon carrying rice to Shanghai have also stopped loading.

Sailing Empty to Hong Kong - Due to the limitations of the environment and the many inconveniences in sailing, the merchant ships managed by Norwegian merchants in the Far East have been contacting the shipowners to return the management rights, and they are seeking to be managed by merchants of other nationalities. It is heard that some Norwegian ships will be leased to British and American shipping companies, and negotiations are underway. Shanghai is a gathering place for ships from various countries. Since the European war, British and French merchant ships have changed course first, followed by the suspension of some German ships. Now, the shipping of Denmark and Norway is also affected by the war. This is an unprecedented change in shipping. According to general observation, the European situation has recently taken a sharp turn, and the situation is becoming increasingly tense. If the war continues to deteriorate, German and Italian merchant ships in the Far East will also be affected, which is a concern for the entire shipping industry.

### Expanding Fundraising for Charity Rice Sales - Fundraising Agencies Remain Various Trade Associations

After the Shanghai Charity Rice Sales Committee decided to continue operating, the fundraising goal for charity rice sales was temporarily set at one million yuan. In addition to the more than 300,000 yuan already pledged by various industries, the remaining amount is being solicited by Chairman Yu Qiaqing from various other sectors to ensure that the goal is achieved. At the same time, it is hoped that enthusiastic people from all walks of life will donate voluntarily. The fundraising agencies remain the Shanghai Jin Cheng, Fu Yuan, Tong Run and other trade associations, and it is scheduled to hold a committee meeting next week to expand fundraising efforts and discuss the date and methods of charity rice sales.

### Two US Warships to Sail to Shanghai from the Philippines - Expected to Arrive This Month - Cruisers May Also Arrive

According to the Continental Daily News, sources say that the US warship Black Hawk and a destroyer squadron from the US Asiatic Fleet will sail from Manila to Shanghai this month, and will sail to Qingdao in June to spend the summer. There is no news yet about the movements of the cruisers Augusta and Marblehead, but it is heard that the two ships will also arrive here soon. Six old-style US submarines and the US warship Canopus, which arrived in Shanghai from the Philippines last week, are expected to sail to Qingdao next week and return to Manila in November. It is heard that the new-style submarines in the Asiatic Fleet will remain in Manila. The US transport ship Henderson, carrying US troops to Shanghai for rotation, is scheduled to sail from the US Pacific coast via Guam and the Philippines to Shanghai on May 1st.

### Refugee Camps to Close Next Month - Only One Remaining on Dunxin Road - Sheltering the Old, Young, and Disabled

Salvation Army leader Mr. Maurice told reporters yesterday that all of the more than 30 refugee camps in Shanghai will be closed by the end of May, and the refugee problem in Shanghai will become a thing of the past. However, the refugee camp on Dunxin Road will be retained to shelter the elderly, orphaned children, or the disabled. Regarding the refugee relief funding, Mr. Maurice said that the highest recorded amount in 1937 was 725,000 yuan per month, but it has gradually decreased to 70,000 yuan per month. However, refugee donations from entertainment venues have not yet been cancelled. Mr. Maurice also said that although efforts are being made to enable refugees to seek a living on their own, these methods have been difficult to implement. The so-called beggar camps have been re-established due to environmental needs, and the refugee problem has not been solved. However, he believes that the number of beggars in Shanghai will be reduced to around one thousand in the near future. He also said that each discharged refugee will be given a subsidy of 15 yuan for adults and 5 yuan for minors. In this way, each larger family can receive around 60 yuan, which most can use as capital to return to their hometowns and engage in farming or seek other livelihoods. The Salvation Army also provides considerable travel expenses to refugees who are discharged and return to their hometowns, so that they can return to their homelands and have their duties taken over by others, in order to solve the refugee problem in Shanghai. Mr. Maurice also pointed out that all matters are being carried out in appropriate steps to ensure that they are effective and economical. However, the Salvation Army will never adopt a group resettlement method, because everyone's situation is different, and the resettlement method for each person must be given considerable consideration. Currently, they believe that 75% of the refugees can find their own way out, and others will be given appropriate training for a period of time. Refugee resettlement has already begun, and about half of the refugee camps will be closed by the end of this month. As for the others, they must be closed by the end of May. Orphans in the refugee camp on Dunxin Road will be given appropriate education, training, and vocational training so that these children can be self-sufficient when they grow up. Others who are old, weak, and disabled will be given appropriate medical care to maintain their health. It is estimated that these expenses will cost about 7 yuan per month per person. The expenses incurred in the beggar camps will be equal to this amount. However, the beggars in the beggar camps cannot have absolute freedom and must be subject to strict training, because most of them are inherently lazy, and strict training is necessary to correct their bad habits. Finally, Mr. Maurice recounted the history of the refugee camps and expressed his deep gratitude for the enthusiasm of the people of Shanghai in helping the refugees, because since the establishment of the camps, there has never been a problem with funding. In short, the refugee problem in Shanghai has a glorious history, and the refugees have benefited greatly. Not only have they obtained appropriate jobs, but most of those who were ill have also been cured. Mr. Maurice expressed his gratitude to Mr. Yu Qiaqing and Mr. Yuan Ludeng, because they were extremely hardworking in preparing the refugee donations. However, the high cost of living also has a great impact on refugee relief. In the past, the relief fee for each refugee was only 2.73 yuan per month, but now it is impossible to do without 7 yuan per month.

### Christian Association Sponsors Sacred Music Concert

The Shanghai Sacred Music Choir, composed of 150 people, after half a year of preparation and training, is scheduled to perform Cherubini's masterpiece, the Fourth Mass, at Moore Memorial Church on the evenings of April 27th and 28th at 7:30 PM, conducted by Professor Zhao Meibo. The concert will last for two hours. Tickets will not be sold for this event; it is a fundraising event, with seating tickets offered in denominations of one, three, and five yuan. The funds raised will be used to help refugees in other areas. Those who love music can both help a good cause and listen to sacred music, which is refreshing and joyful, a double win. Please contact us early to avoid disappointment. Contact Moore Memorial Church, American Church, and various churches.

### Strike at British United Shipyards - Re-mediated - Hefeng Factory Responds with Slowdown - Departure of Shengjing Ship from Dock Delayed

The British United Shipyards, including the Ruirong, Hesheng, Yiesong, and Si factories, are owned by British merchants. The workers at the British United factories have been brewing disputes because the employers have not fulfilled the labor-management agreement signed on December 6, 1937. On March 15th, the Ruirong, Hesheng, and Yiesong factories went on strike, presenting British Manager Bonner with eleven demands for improving living conditions, raising wages, and fulfilling the labor-management agreement. Eleven representatives elected by the British United Shipyard Workers' Union negotiated with the employers, and the Political Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council intervened to mediate. A month has passed, and the workers are in dire straits, suffering greatly. During this time, they have received sympathy and assistance from all sectors of society in Shanghai, and they are very grateful for the donations. On the 16th, workers at the Hefeng Shipyard in Pudong (across the river from Yangshupu) also responded with a slowdown, but the order is very good. It is heard that Mr. Yuan Ludeng will now mediate between labor and management, so the strike may be resolved satisfactorily. It is heard that the Taikoo Company's Beiyang class Shengjing is also being repaired at the factory. It was originally scheduled to leave the dock today and resume sailing tomorrow (20th), but because the workers are slowing down, the ship's engine blades and anchors have not been installed, so it is uncertain whether it can leave the dock today. The Taikoo Company is doing its best to find a solution, and plans to hire Russian craftsmen to go to the factory to install and manage.

### Five German Residents of French Concession Ordered to Leave - Reason: Five People's Actions Violated Conditions - Other German Residents May Still Reside

According to the North China Daily News, the French Consulate General has announced that five German residents in the French Concession have been ordered to leave the French Concession before the 30th of this month. When the European War broke out last September, the French Concession authorities notified German residents in the Concession that if they did not disturb public order and their actions did not violate the neutral status of the French Concession, they could continue to reside there. However, these five people did not abide by this statement, so they have been ordered to move out of their French Concession residences within the month. As for the rumor that all German residents in the French Concession will be gradually expelled, this is not accurate. Only German residents whose actions violate the conditions for residing in the French Concession will be ordered to leave.

### Second Batch of Aluminum Subsidiary Coins Arrives in Shanghai - Ready for Issuance - Those Receiving Subsidiary Coins Temporarily Limited to Money Exchange Businesses

After the Shanghai Banking Association obtained approval from the Ministry of Finance to issue one-cent and five-cent aluminum subsidiary coins, the first batch has been fully issued and is widely circulating in the market, which citizens have praised as convenient. The second batch of ten million coins has been shipped to Shanghai by the American company Arctic Corporation, with each bag of one-cent coins worth 100 yuan and each bag of five-cent coins worth 500 yuan. It is heard that the Association has ordered the United Bank Preparatory Committee to receive and issue them, but those receiving them are temporarily limited to members of the Silver and Money Exchange Association and member banks of the Foreign Banks Association.

### Whether to Continue Selling Cheap Coal Briquettes - Discussed Today - Coal Prices on the Black Market Rise Again

The Shanghai Mechanical Coal Briquette Trade Association's third round of cheap coal briquette sales will end tomorrow, and whether to hold the fourth round of cheap coal briquette sales depends on the negotiations of the manufacturers. Therefore, the association notified all manufacturers yesterday to hold a joint meeting at the Coal Industry Building on Tianjin Road at 3:00 PM this afternoon to discuss various issues. There is currently a lot of coal in Shanghai, and 3,000 to 4,000 tons of foreign coal are shipped to Shanghai every day. 11,000 tons of Indian coal arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday and are currently being unloaded at the Qichang Wharf and other wharves. Moreover, a certain coal mining company regularly ships about 100,000 tons of bituminous coal to Shanghai every month, so there is no shortage of coal in Shanghai. However, general speculators are taking advantage of the tense European war and manipulating the coal market, causing black market prices to rise by more than ten yuan, making it difficult for users to purchase.

### Post-War Gold and Silver - Total Export Value - To Replenish Legal Tender Reserves - Currency Prices Depend on Stability

In order to maintain the statutory exchange rate and stabilize the value of legal tender, the National Government will export cash gold and silver to replenish reserves. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned from customs yesterday that the total statistics of gold and silver exports from August 26th to February 29th were 4,885,279 gold and 426,408,938 yuan of silver.

### Principal and Interest on Various Bonds Issued After the War - Paid in Full - Special Funds Stored for Payment - Bond Market Therefore Improves

In order to maintain creditworthiness, the Ministry of Finance is making efforts to pay the principal and interest of domestic and foreign debts on schedule, even in the midst of financial difficulties. Although the Shanghai customs tax revenue has been seized, the Central Bank initially overdrafted and paid it. Although it has now been stated that separate payment methods will be determined for bonds guaranteed by customs duties, the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank are still discounting and paying for the Unified Reconstruction Gold Long-Term Three Internal Debts, which is sufficient to prove the government's determination to maintain creditworthiness. The Ministry will allocate the funds for the principal and interest due on the National Salvation Public Bond, National Defense Public Bond, Gold Public Bond, and Construction Military Supply Public Bond issued after the war to the Central Bank for special storage in accordance with the regulations of each bond. (1) The second repayment of principal and payment of interest on the National Defense Public Bond and Gold Public Bond, as well as the first repayment of principal and payment of interest on the Construction Public Bond, are scheduled to begin at the end of April. (2) The first repayment of principal and payment of interest on the Military Supply Public Bond are scheduled to begin at the end of June. (3) The third payment of interest on the National Salvation Public Bond is scheduled to begin at the end of August. (4) The ninth repayment of principal and payment of interest on the five types of Unified Public Bond A, B, C, D, and E is scheduled to begin at the end of July. Today, bondholders admire the government's painstaking efforts to maintain creditworthiness, so the buying interest in the unified bonds on the Shanghai stock market's black market is strong, and the bond market is improving. The high rise in the unified price is rare after the war.

### British St. George's Society - Screening War Films - Location at Cathay Theater

The British St. George's Society is scheduled to screen British war films at the Cathay Theater on the 23rd of this month. The Society is also scheduled to hold a meal at the French Club on the same day. The film is to promote the British war effort and is entitled "Courage is Enough to Overcome." All members of the Central Aviation Association will attend at 7:30 PM that afternoon.

### Travelers to Hanoi - Restricted from Carrying Used Clothing - Those for Personal Use Must Declare in Advance

The Chinese Consul General in Hanoi has sent a letter to the visa commissioner stationed in Hong Kong under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Travelers from Shanghai and Hong Kong carrying clothes to Hanoi and then to the mainland should first report the number of items. Those for profit should pay taxes, otherwise, once discovered, the fines are quite high. The announcement of the Hong Kong Visa Commissioner's Office is recorded as follows: "Now, the Consulate General in Hanoi has sent a letter stating that some merchants in Hong Kong, Shanghai, and other places are buying used Western-style clothes and mixing them into the luggage and transporting them to Vietnam and then to Sichuan, Yunnan, and other provinces for sale in order to make profits. Some carry too many clothes and the styles and sizes are different, which causes the customs to accuse them of tax evasion and the fines are quite high. These merchants are taking advantage of themselves and also implicating general travelers who do not intend to profit. It is proposed to notify merchants traveling from Shanghai and Hong Kong to Vietnam: (1) If the used clothes are actually for profit, they should apply for a consular visa in advance and declare and pay taxes in accordance with the law when importing (border tax is 1% per day or 4% per hundred). (2) Travelers carrying more Western-style clothes for personal use must also declare the number of Western-style suits in the box before customs officers inspect their luggage to avoid misunderstandings. Please check and handle accordingly, and it should be handled accordingly. It is announced for general knowledge."

### Post Office Suspends Acceptance of Parcels to Various Locations Due to Transportation Difficulties

Parcels and bulk and small parcels to Pingxiang Bureau and personal scattered parcels to Wen'an Bureau can be resumed for acceptance.

### Fank Ling, Chairman of the Board, Summary of Annual Meeting Speech (2)

Food and Goods

The soaring prices of food and various essential goods are a serious problem. I am not an economics expert, but from an economic standpoint, dealing with such problems requires extreme caution. Overly strict control of these goods by the authorities is not a perfect solution and often leads to failure. This bureau has been cooperating with the authorities of the French Concession to suppress prices and crack down on hoarding, speculation, and profiteering, and has received automatic assistance from all sectors. We are doing our best within our power. However, until the situation is stabilized and goods from the interior can be transported to Shanghai as usual, a true solution to this problem will be difficult to achieve. As for food imported from abroad, the cost will inevitably be higher based on current exchange rates. In other words, unless rice produced in the interior can be transported to Shanghai without any restrictions or miscellaneous taxes, it will be difficult to expect a significant drop in rice prices in this port.

Relief Work

In order to comprehensively resolve the beggar problem in the concession, this bureau previously announced a plan to accommodate beggars, which I believe has attracted attention and support from all sectors. It should be noted that the beggar problem and the refugee problem are interrelated. In the past, many Chinese and foreign organizations have been generous in donating to help accommodate refugees, which is deeply appreciated. In addition, the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, various provincial and regional associations, trade guilds, and charitable organizations have established shelters and raised funds to help refugees. At the same time, the Salvation Army is also closely involved in refugee relief and has generously offered to take on the work of accommodating beggars. Bureau staff are unable to allocate resources, and this work requires trained professionals to handle social problems effectively. The beggar problem faces practical and economic difficulties and cannot be resolved until the refugee problem is resolved. In view of this, the bureau has suggested that refugee shelters should merge as soon as possible and arrange for refugees to be given money and dispersed, in order to convert to accommodating beggars in early winter this year. The Salvation Army has not raised funds for accommodating beggars, but it is expected that the funds donated to aid refugees can be used for accommodating beggars.

Since 1937, I have been involved in the administrative guidance of the concession and, fortunately, have not made any significant mistakes. I am personally gratified. I will no longer address you as the Chairman of the Board. However, I am optimistic about the future of the concession. The concession has real value and importance not only for foreigners in general but also for China and the Chinese people.

Last Year's Accounts

The financial situation of the bureau for the year 1939 has been detailed in the report of the Chief Financial Officer, which I believe you have all read. However, I must emphasize one important point regarding the more noteworthy events of the past year. The continuous devaluation of the national currency last year had a significant impact on the bureau's various expenses, starting in June. Various exceptional expenditures calculated in foreign currency and the cost of all imported goods saw immediate increases. Most other items and materials also increased in price, resulting in a shortfall in the bureau's budget for the last year exceeding the initial estimate by about three million yuan. Although we sought remedies in terms of finance in July last year, the restrictions under the bureau's "Temporary Debt" item could be used to offset part of the deficit, but the loss was heavy and not very cost-effective. As for issuing national currency bonds, it was practically difficult to do so. Therefore, apart from borrowing foreign currency, there was no other good plan. At that time, the bureau's temporary loans from banks had reached £335,000. Due to urgent needs, another £100,000 was borrowed, totaling £435,000. The Financial Officer's report details the revised method for the 1926 6% bond fund. After the bureau sold the electricity division, it was originally planned to repay the bond at the end of 1936. However, the situation in 1935 was poor, and the repayment period was postponed. At the same time, the deposit of the bond fund was revised. As a result, the surplus fund of 2,577,502 yuan could be used as temporary income, and the interest of 581,226 yuan could be transferred to the general reserve fund. In addition, the investable amount of the fund is estimated to be around 3,158,728 yuan. As for the bureau's temporary overdraft last year, it has been reduced from 7,776,595 yuan to 2,970,523 yuan, as detailed in the Financial Officer's report, which I will not repeat here. All reports and accounts of the bureau as of December 31 last year should be approved.

### Proprietor and Manager of a Native Bank Embezzles Iron Box and is Fined - Over 20,000 Yuan Stored Inside Secretly Moved Away, False Report to Police Leads to Confession

Yin Zuhao, a native of Hangzhou, a shareholder and manager of Lichang Native Bank at 477 Sichuan Road, Ningbo Road, reported to the General Patrol Room at 9:30 p.m. on the 11th of this month that the bank had US$1,394 and Japanese Yen 1,000, totaling 23,470 yuan in Chinese currency, placed in a small iron box that suddenly

disappeared. He requested an investigation. Detective Feng Qishan and Detective Zhu Wanjun were assigned to investigate. Initially, Qian Xianglin, the clerk from Zhenjiang, was suspected, and he was arrested, sent to the First Special Court for interrogation, and detained for investigation. Later, detectives found that Qian had nothing to do with the case and requested the Special Court to release Qian. They learned that the real culprit was Yin Zuhao himself.

Yin was arrested and sent to the Fourth Criminal Division of the First Special Court yesterday morning. Chiang Bao-lien, the police lawyer, charged him with theft, stating that the defendant stole the iron box and took it to Room 321 of the Far Eastern Hotel on Yuqiaqing Road. He bought a screw cone and tried to open the iron box. He then took the money to his home at 10 Lane 14, Baierbu Road, in the French Concession, and stored it there, abandoning the screw cone and iron box in the Far East. All the stolen goods and the iron box, etc.,

have been recovered. Guo Shiping, the representative of Lichang Native Bank, complained about everything. Because all the lost money had been recovered, he requested that the matter not be pursued further. When questioned, the defendant Yin Zuhao remained silent and hired a lawyer to defend him. Judge Meng sentenced Yin to a fine of 500 yuan, which could be commuted to labor service at 3 yuan per day, and ordered his lawyer to bail him out.

### Police and Bandits Exchange Fire, Woman Killed

Several detectives from the Public Concession Police Department, while patrolling the intersection of Jiaozhou Road and Changping Road at 10:45 a.m. yesterday, noticed two suspicious-looking men loitering there. When they approached to search them, one of them opened fire, resisting arrest. The detectives immediately returned fire. Both sides fired four or five shots. Seeing the situation was not good, the bandits fled and disappeared without a trace. When both sides opened fire, a stray bullet struck a woman named Guo Gu, who was passing by. It is reported that she died of her injuries.

### Protagonist of Parricide Case Applies for Re-examination, Formal Petition Submitted Yesterday

Zhou Qinji and Zhou Qianxiang, the two sons who caused a sensation in society for their parricide case, dissatisfied with the judgment of the first instance on the grounds that they suffered from hereditary mental illness, appealed to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. The court had already held a hearing a few days ago and the matter was being investigated. It is now learned that the two sons, dissatisfied with the forensic report, entrusted their defense lawyers, Ye Shaoying and others, to file a petition with the Second High Court for a re-examination, and argued that several mental illness experts should be hired to conduct a joint examination. The petition was formally submitted to the High Court yesterday. (Huaguang News Agency)

### Fraudulently Obtaining Money by Transferring House, Weaving Factory Owner Accused

Huang Shihuan, a local resident living at 11 Youyi Lane, 410 Jin Shenfu Road, French Concession, who previously worked at the Jianghai Customs, is 60 years old. Recently, he entrusted lawyer Huang Jiyuan to file a complaint with the Second Criminal Court, accusing Xu Yongkang, the owner of Yongxin Weaving Factory at 1226 Lane 1, Jiale Road (28 years old, the factory's business department and distribution office is located at 308 Fada Road), of fraudulently obtaining money by advertising the transfer of the house and requesting a legal investigation. According to the complaint, the defendant advertised the transfer of the house at 125 Lane 569, Ya'erbei Road, on March 6 this year. The plaintiff, needing a house to live in, went to see the defendant, who said that the lease of the house was not fixed and there was no lease agreement. Believing this to be true, they agreed on a price of 1,650 yuan for the transfer and paid a deposit of 280 yuan, holding a receipt. On the 11th of the same month, when he went with the money, the defendant suddenly refused to issue a transfer document, and forcibly sold furniture, deliberately pointing east and saying west. The plaintiff became suspicious. After investigation, he learned that the lease of the house was not only for a fixed term, but was about to expire, and the defendant concealed this, implementing deceptive

methods, clearly intending to illegally possess it for himself, and using fraud to make others hand over their property, committing the crime of fraud under Article 339 of the Criminal Law. He requested a legal investigation and attached a civil lawsuit, ordering the defendant to repay the plaintiff 280 yuan in national currency. The court accepted the complaint and Judge Zhu Chuzhe held a hearing yesterday morning. Both parties and their lawyers were present. After a detailed hearing in court, the court announced that the case still needed to be investigated and adjourned for another hearing.

### British Soldiers Arrest Bandits

British troops stationed on Daxilu Road, West Shanghai, arrested seven bandits named Chen Daosan, Zhao Rongsheng, Zhong Guoliang, Shi Zhongliang, Zhu Jiashou, Cheng Meisheng, and Ma Xingsheng at 11:30 a.m. on the 11th of this month, confiscating 229 yuan in national currency and several pieces of silverware. After investigation, it was proven that the criminals had robbed others of their property at 633 Yuqiaqing Road, 23 Lane 67, Zhao Jiaqiao, Hede Road, and Ningbo Road, Shandong Road, etc., in the Public Concession. They were transferred to the General Inspectorate and sent to the First Criminal Division of the First Special Court yesterday morning. The police lawyer Ru Baoyi requested permission to temporarily detain them for further investigation. After questioning by Judge Qian Hongye, they were ordered to be detained pending another hearing.

The Huishan Police Station arrested Sun Youqing and Kong Fuquan, two Shaoxing bandits, a few days ago for robbing the home of Ruan Hongkun at 36 Lane 590, Haining Road, of 100 yuan in national currency and 17 silver bars. The case was concluded by the First Special Court. Yesterday morning, the case was proposed, and Judge Xiao Peishen sentenced Sun Youqing and Kong Fuquan to six years of imprisonment each for repeated armed robbery.

The Huishan Police Station arrested three Russian thieves on the 31st of last month for stealing Western suits worth 100 yuan from a Japanese laundry at 2 Lane 642, Dongxi Huade Road. The case has been concluded by the First Special Court.

### Hand Grenade Explodes in Garbage Bin, Three Scavengers Injured

At the intersection of Guanchang Road and Xiaoshadu Road in West Shanghai, at about 10:30 a.m. yesterday, three Jiangbei scavengers, Zhang Hongsheng, Wang Xueyi, and Wang Jinlou, were picking up rags and paper scraps in a garbage bin when a hand grenade placed in the bin exploded unexpectedly when Zhang and others were using iron hooks to rummage through the bin. The sound was deafening, and Zhang and others were caught off guard, with iron fragments injuring their chests and other parts. Bleeding profusely, they fell to the ground. The patrolling police heard the alarm and rushed to the scene, calling an ambulance to rush them to the Second Branch of Tongren Hospital for treatment.

### Using Counterfeit Currency Arrested

According to a report from the Japanese side yesterday, on Wednesday of this week, a Romanian expatriate named Andrelev was arrested by the Japanese in the Hongkou District for using a five-yuan counterfeit currency when paying for a car fare. On that day, Andrelev hired a taxi from the Hongkou Shanghai Automobile Company. When he arrived at his destination, the Bund, he handed the driver a five-yuan bill and asked for 3.50 yuan in change. The driver saw that the paper was different and rushed to the taxi company to identify it. At that time, Andrelev was still waiting quietly in the car. After a few minutes, the driver arrived and drove Andrelev to the Wusong Japanese Military Police Branch, where he was arrested by the Japanese. It is also reported that there have been several cases of foreigners using invalid banknotes in Hongkou recently.

### Truck Kills a Person

Chen Yongqing, a Jiangbei resident living at 7 Lane 10, Jiaxiyi Road, French Concession, 45 years old, was sitting on a small wooden box at the entrance of 223 Lane, Xujiahui Road, playing idly at 1:30 p.m. on the 8th of this month, when a freight truck No. F-1425 driven by truck driver Huang Changshun drove into the lane. Because the entrance of the lane was narrow and Chen did not avoid it, he crushed his leg bone. The police sent Chen to the hospital for treatment, but he died on the 16th. The police sent truck driver Huang Changshun to the First Criminal Division of the Second Special Court. The police lawyer filed a public prosecution for the crime of causing death due to negligence in business. After a trial by Judge Ao, he was ordered to be detained for another hearing.

### Publishing News

The 10th issue of Xifeng Supplement has been published. The American correspondent Chen Donglin's article "Who is the Master of the White House" analyzes the future US election and is extremely valuable.

### Ordering Raw Materials for Wire Nails, Foreign Firm Comprador Accused, Refusing to Deliver Goods Due to Outbreak of European War, Nail Factory Sues for Performance and Compensation

Wangfu Nail Factory at 297 Yichang Road, opened by Xu Hengde, ordered 300 tons of raw material for wire nails "new coil ingot" from Bide Long Foreign Firm at 255 Beijing Road through the introduction of Rong Jintang on May 8 last year. The firm's Chinese comprador, Tong Kuixuan, was responsible for the negotiation, and the price was set at US$42.75 per ton, with delivery scheduled for August of the same year. The contract was signed by Luke Mann, the head of the Bide Long Foreign Firm. In early September, 100 tons were delivered first. Later, due to the outbreak of war in Europe on September 4, steel prices soared. Therefore, the Bide Long Foreign Firm used the war as an excuse and has delayed delivery until now. Wangfu Nail Factory ordered the goods very early, and they had already been shipped abroad and even arrived at the port. The firm intends to breach the contract to seize huge profits. Therefore, it entrusted Tang Ying, Jiang Yiping, and Ge Bangren as lawyers to file a lawsuit with the First Special Court, seeking performance and compensation for damages. The court accepted the complaint, and Judge Mo Runhua summoned them for questioning yesterday. First, the plaintiff's agent Chen Ming stated the purpose of the lawsuit. Then, the defendant Tong Kuixuan and Rong Jintang pushed responsibility on each other, claiming that although they were managers, they were not responsible for business. Then, the plaintiff's agent presented Liu Tonggui, the former Chinese manager of Bide Long Foreign Firm, to testify, stating that according to custom, the Chinese manager of each foreign firm is indeed responsible for trade, and the signing by Westerners is only a formality. Judge Cao verified the testimony and adjourned the hearing for further investigation.

### Finance - Not Much Money Lent for Pledged Goods - Gold Market Suddenly Rises Again in the Afternoon

Yesterday's spot gold market conditions, the afternoon market was quiet, and the evening market suddenly soared, reaching as high as 5,840 yuan.

Before long, gold shops and silver shops rushed into the market to buy, trying to raise the price to 5,788 yuan in a flat state.

After that, the exchange rate reported a loosening, causing selling sentiment, and the price fell by 38 yuan. Silver shops sold 20 taels to gold shops for 5,750 yuan. Later, a certain securities gang suddenly became interested in buying, and the exchange rate changed from loose to flat, so sellers naturally decreased. The price rose again by 20 yuan.

At noon, the general bullish sentiment was only temporary due to delivery reasons, so the head position suddenly became loose, and the price fell another 14 yuan.

Gold shops bought 10 taels from money changers for 5,840 yuan. After 3:30 p.m., buyers decreased, and retail investors sold again at high prices, so the price fell back 35 yuan.

### Japanese Yarn Factory Settles: Forward Sterling

Yesterday's exchange market saw no change in HSBC's listed prices. The unofficial market for Sterling and US Dollar remained calm, with only minor fluctuations at the opening, eventually returning to the morning's opening levels. Operators generally lacked enthusiasm. The initial trading was disorderly, with speculators buying and selling intermittently. Although the volume of chips was not congested, the situation still tended to loosen. Subsequently, the market was very sluggish, with most transactions being interbank. Therefore, spot US Dollar transactions at six yuan were very common. The afternoon also started quietly. Soon, the Japanese yarn factory suddenly bought forward Sterling, and speculators also followed suit, buying US Dollar, with the momentum slightly weakening. At this time, outside firms continued to supply with undiminished intention, but buyers' appetite was indifferent, so the late closing returned to flat. As a result, Sterling closed at 4/125, and the US Dollar at 5.96875. As for the futures US Dollar, it remained unchanged, while Sterling was slightly softened.

It is calculated that speculators bought five-month US Dollars at 5.6875 from outside firms, while outside firms received five-month US Dollars from speculators at 5.71875. The interbank transaction price for spot US Dollar was six yuan. HSBC's listed prices remained unchanged. The white silver balance tax revealed a large 0.50.

### Securities: Jardine Matheson Shares Skyrocket, Domestic Debt Quite Weak

Yesterday, the securities unofficial market situation turned weak and falling again. The claim of Nanchang's recapture could not be confirmed, and the tightening of monetary policy made it impossible for the bulls to find positions. The excessively high interbank lending rates added another layer of restraint. With the approaching fourth bottom ratio period, the impact on the bond market was even greater. Even without other rumors, it was not easy to be optimistic for the time being. Looking at yesterday's events, the market price was stable at the beginning of the morning opening. Jianli and Yiyuan covered short positions, but real goods from Jardine Matheson, Xie Dafu, Datongji, etc., gradually flowed out, and the price slowly fell. Although Tongcheng, Hongkang, and scattered retail investors supplemented their positions, Tongguang, Taifeng, Yitai, etc., also sold goods for profit, so the noon closing market price failed to stabilize. Selling pressure was even stronger in the afternoon. Hengkang, Yongkang, and Lianhe sold out in large numbers. Xiexing and Yuanrunli covered short positions. Yichang, Xie Da, and Lianyi bought in slightly. Hongda first advanced and then came out again. The 41st number entered C and exited A. Tiansheng, Xinchang, Yuanqi, Hu Heji, etc., still sold out. Grade E broke 50 yuan, Grade C would retreat into the 9 yuan level, and Grade D also broke 9 yuan. As a result, it consistently returned a small 4 to 5.5 jiao compared to the previous day. The total number of transactions was approximately 1.2 million yuan. A brief table is listed below.

Stock transactions: 100 shares of Great China Match Company were traded at a price of 25.5 yuan.

At the opening of the public stock market, those closing their floating profits were still in droves, but this trend soon stopped. Then the bulls became active again and went in groups, and the market was immersed in a buying atmosphere. Several types rose sharply beyond the usual.

Jardine Matheson and Steel stocks can be called the "stars of the stars" among the rising stocks. Shanghai Bank, International, Yangzi, and other stocks also followed quickly. Jardine Matheson opened at 178 yuan, and after a period of hope and spin, buyers suddenly came to compete to buy, and in an instant flew to 200 yuan, and then fluctuated within a price range of 5-6 yuan. In the afternoon, another wave of buying was triggered, and the price jumped directly to 204 yuan, but the closing was peaceful, with buyers at 201 yuan. Steel stocks broke all previous high price records yesterday, opening at 32.25 yuan. After opening and hovering, they also leaped to 37.75 yuan in an instant. The late closing was buying at 37 yuan and selling at 37.25 yuan. The opening price of Shanghai Bank was only 30 yuan, and after a large number of transactions, the price also went straight ahead, with the closing price being buying at 33 yuan and selling at 33.5 yuan.

At noon, a Washington telecommunications message was received, saying that "The US government must maintain the status quo on the Dutch East Indies issue, even if the Netherlands is thrown into the vortex of the European war." This message made the general public suddenly start buying rubber stocks that had not been invigorated, and prices made considerable progress.

London, 17th (Wednesday) Telegram: Today's listed prices for Chinese foreign debt saw three types of debts, namely, Restructuring, suddenly fell. The rest remained stable and unchanged.

The Restructuring Loan, Anglo-French Bond fell by 1 pound, at a price of 38 pounds.

London, 17th (Wednesday) Telegram: Today's listed prices for British Far East company stocks were generally stable, with almost no change in market prices. Only the security insurance shares had a new market price reduced by half a pound due to interest payments, at a price of 29 pounds.

### Yarn and Cotton: Yarn Rises Again, Spot Supply Becomes Tighter

The yarn market, which had plummeted the previous day (the 17th), rebounded yesterday (the 18th), due to the lack of spot goods and the tightening of supply. Although there was demand in the inland areas, there were no spot goods to be had. Therefore, the weak hearts suddenly turned firm. Recently, the market has seen rapid falls and rises, which is frightening. Some say that the number of cotton yarns transported to Xianggang (Hong Kong) according to the investigation of this newspaper is estimated to be more than 20,000 bales.

The opening of current yarn was peaceful, and a certain major player took advantage of the situation to throw out, lowering the market, and then dragging it in again, so the market began to tire and then rise. The opening price of 20 count Double Horse factory single yarn was 1,325 yuan, and dozens of bales were sold. At this time, the merchant gangs also watched and did not move. However, the selling price of 23 count Golden Rooster yarn has been expensive to more than 1,500, and there is no spot. It was also heard that the cloth market has risen sharply, and so-and-so came to collect in again, and the market was promoted by this, and suddenly rose. The price of 20 count Double Horse factory single yarn was 1,385 yuan, and spot goods rose to 1,395 yuan. The statistics of transactions in half a day were 2,222 bales. The market price of 20 count Double Horse spot yarn rose by 58 yuan.

In the afternoon, there were special storms again, and the yarn market's heart was burning again. It was heard that 20 count Double Horse spot yarn was 1,420 yuan, and a few bales were traded, and there was still talk of not being able to buy it. This kind of unpredictable situation is impossible to grasp, and it is a speculation that speculators are stirring up waves. The amount bought by each gang is listed as follows.

### Active Foreign Cotton Trading

This cotton trade is less colorful than before. The market is flat and not as neat as the yarn market, because sales are still narrow. However, the afternoon took on a slightly rising image. The transaction of the current cotton is listed on the left.

Another message: For foreign cotton, the New York cotton market was very active and firm in the early morning. Later, it returned and tired due to public purchases and some short covering. The closing price rose 45 pounds sound compared to the previous day. The Indian cotton market fell two Robi yesterday along with the forecast, and the Egyptian cotton market rose more than 20 pounds sound.

The Shanghai foreign cotton market continued to be unusually active yesterday. Although futures transactions were heard, they were not as active as spot goods. There are quite a few traders who are searching for 42 count raw materials. The market is extremely short of this type of raw cotton, so long fibers are currently more popular than general raw materials. The cotton market yesterday, converted at a rate of 5.9375 US dollars, is as follows:

### Grain: Rice Market Changes, From Tired to Firm and Firm Again, Foreign Rice Continues to Arrive in Shanghai

Since the rice market was slightly frustrated in the previous dynasty, although the market prices of various goods have not risen or fallen much, people are tired of this situation. At the beginning of yesterday morning, the original wholesalers and peddlers had no intention of selling, and the sales field, whether inland customers or local shops, took the opportunity to act. At the same time, floating hoarders and scatterers, etc., who are generally mindful of the family, are fundamentally based on grabbing the lead, and when the market is constantly changing dramatically, they will sell the profitable goods one after another, so a lot of recycled goods were filled in the morning. Xiao Jiao was only 42.5 yuan, which has been almost a yuan since the previous market. However, after a fall, it can attract customers. Once the stores see the situation move, they will continue to do it, and the route will be opened up, and the shouting will rise, and the market will turn from tired to firm. In an instant, the original plate was restored, but the general trend was not healthy, and once it moved, it would be relaxed, and as the customers here would take advantage of the high push, it would cause some back winds, and under the pressure of environmental changes, there was no room for standing, and it retreated in bursts, and the market price of each cargo fell again, and from then on all the way down, and there was no opportunity to turn around, and the result was a depreciation of 6-7 jiao. It is estimated that the closing price of No. 1 West Buy is 47 yuan, Huowen is 46 yuan, and Xiao Jiao is 43 yuan. Only rice tea and mixed crushed rice are not much, and there is no rise or fall, and they stand guard on the original plate.

Due to the rain, the arrival of japonica glutinous rice has become less common, with a total of more than 1,000 bags, so the japonica rice market has not changed from the previous day, similar to the previous one, but glutinous rice is due to the rising prices of foreign rice in recent days, the market price standard distance is out of order, extremely low, and much cheaper than other goods, attracting large households to continue to collect, and the best-selling of cake shops and rice shops, the situation is tight, and the market price is raised by yuan. If Ao Te Yuan is sold at 41 yuan, the other common Dan goods are already 38-9 yuan.

Foreign rice has arrived in Shanghai again. On the previous day (16th), the French postal ship company's irregular ship, from Saigon, transported 920 tons of foreign rice, including 80 tons of bag rice, which has been completely unloaded. The ship left Shanghai for Japan yesterday morning. Yesterday, there were Yihua foreign firms' Ding Sheng wheels, from Hong Kong, transported 1,447 bags of foreign rice, which were imported yesterday morning, and docked at the Roosevelt Pier for unloading. There were also 4,536 bags of foreign rice transported from the original ship to Tianjin. Also, Taikoo's Jiangsu wheels arrived yesterday afternoon, also transported 1,659 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong. It is heard that Zhava company's Zhibosha is transporting a large number of foreign rice to Shanghai in Saigon, approximately on Monday (22nd). (Zu)

Yesterday's foreign rice market saw ups and downs. Recycled goods have been absorbed by North Gang and Chinese households inside and outside for days, and yesterday's production was also reported to rise again, and the seller shouted higher than before. Holders were willing to sell in June, and the price of No. 2 Saigon in April and May was 53.5 yuan, which was immediately raised by half a yuan to 54 yuan, and then from 54 yuan, a corner of two angles, to 54 yuan, a corner and a half. The buying spirit was lively, no less than the excitement of the exchange era. Market fluctuations are not entirely based on facts, and only if the buyer is greedy to do so, the market price will immediately go straight up step by step. The foreign rice market has long been regarded as the only object by speculators, so in the afternoon, after profits were released, it fell from 54 yuan a corner and two angles to 54 yuan, the closing price. Actual consumption of current rice is weak, and those who profit also spit out. Also, it was rumored that the Norwegian ship loaded with rice that was detained has been transferred to Shanghai in Hong Kong. People's hearts were fixed, and the selling price was initially set and then fell. The result was a small two-three corners.

### Flour Mill Market Suddenly Rose by 3 Jiao

The flour market suddenly turned to rising winds, because the factory side was due to the expensive raw material prices, and the pre-set foreign wheat was feared to be unable to be transported to Shanghai as scheduled, so the intention to sell was very firm. For the batch price of this street, after the sale period is over, it will be changed to 13.8 jiao, and then 3 jiao will be released. Yesterday was the 18th, and it has been another month since the end of the flat sale period, and it will be restored to a price of 13.8 jiao, and the recycled goods will also be brought up at the same time. It is heard that the old brand has risen from 13.5 jiao to 7.2 fen, and other mainland and Japanese flour mills are also thriving, and at the time when the gold market yarn flower rice prices are returning to loose, the flour market is increasing in shape, which is unexpected.

Wheat trading has become quiet again, because after a loose fall in the previous two days, the sellers have the intention of supporting because the inventory is dry and the foreign wheat price is expensive. However, the demand for factory customers is not smooth at the moment, and they generally choose the appropriate price. Therefore, it is difficult for the two sides to get close, and the market is in a stalemate again.

### Coal: A Large Number of Coal Weights Arrive in Shanghai One After Another, and the Lack of Coal Transport Ships is Self-Defeating

Recently, those who are in charge of coal on the market have taken advantage of the tense situation in Europe to fabricate rumors, saying that Norwegian merchant ships have stopped sailing, and that the arrival of coal to Shanghai has been affected, and as a result, coal prices have soared. The reporter made a special inquiry to various shipping agencies. It is heard that coal loading is not only dependent on Norwegian ships, but British, American, and Dutch ships are also loaded, and the British merchants' Maher ships load the most, so the source is not a problem. It is heard that a large number of Indian coal will arrive in Shanghai this month, and Vietnamese coal (i.e., Hongji Haiphong coal) will also continue to be transported. The details of the coal-carrying ships are described below. The manager of the foreign head office of Chahe foreign firm, Jeannette Shinner, loaded 7,090 tons of coal from Kalkata. It was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai yesterday, but there was no news of import last night. According to the firm, it is said that there was a slight delay on the road, and it will definitely arrive in Shanghai in the next few days. Also, the manager of the bank, Marion Mollor, also loaded 5,563 tons of coal from Kalkata, and is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow. Also, the Zhongyi company's Enji wheels loaded coal from Hongji (the number is not clear) to Shanghai, and is expected to arrive today. Java company's Stagen, managed by Java company, loaded coal dust from Haiphong (number unclear), scheduled to arrive on the 22nd. Another LiliamMollor wheeled, loaded with 7,000 tons of coal, is expected to arrive around the 13th. The Therese Mollor wheels loaded 546 tons of coal and are expected to arrive around the 25th. Gladys Mollor transported 7,020 tons of coal, and Daisy Mollor (number unclear), two wheels, are expected to arrive around the 26th. Helne Mollor wheeled, loaded with 6,476 tons of coal, and is expected to arrive around the 29th. The above Maher wheels are all transported from Kalkata to Shanghai. There is also Zhongyi Company's Batola wheels, which is also transported from Kalkata to Shanghai (number unclear), and is expected to arrive in Shanghai around the first day of next month. It is heard that there are many other wheels being cut and transported, and the ship names and import dates are not yet suitable for announcement. It is known that there are more than 36,000 tons, and the number is also considerable. The source of coal in this city can be said to be no problem at all. Yesterday, this newspaper published that two ships of Indian coal arrived in Shanghai on the 16th, one of which, the Dutch wheel S·S·Rantaupandjang, was wrongly published as Jeannette Shinner. The ship has not yet arrived in Shanghai and is expected to arrive in Shanghai in the next few days.

### Rummaging Through Old Newspapers: 67 Years Ago (359)

(From a copy of this newspaper from the twelfth year of the Tongzhi reign of the late Qing Dynasty)

Talking About Other People's Fathers (2)

A young man wished to welcome his father back south, but the father said that his fields and ancestral graves were all in the north, and he could not bear to abandon his beloved homeland. The young man suggested that he would go south to bring the family north, to serve his parents day and night. The father was very pleased. However, day after day, the young man did not set out. Some suspected that his filial piety was not genuine, but that he was short of funds. One day, the father urged him to depart. The young man said, "I dare not speak falsely before you. The cost of the journey here was not substantial, but detours and searching for relatives along the way have consumed all the money. To travel with servants would require at least a hundred taels of silver. Please lend me the money, and I promise to return with my mother within a month, and will not cause you any further worry." The father had funds deposited in the Guang Mao Residence, so he discussed it with his employer. The employer wished to see the "true face of Mount Lu" (to get a clear picture), so the father led the young man to meet the employer as a junior friend. The employer treated him with the respect due to a noble guest, hosting a feast and showing respect, and arranged for him to stay at the Guang Mao Residence. The young man was refined and courteous, and the employer congratulated the father on having such a son, suggesting that he stay a little longer and that he would provide funds for his journey. However, the young man always went out with a silk fan and robe, strolling leisurely. When asked about his whereabouts upon his return, he would say that he had been to such and such yamen, such and such office, or such and such official's or secretary's place, but no prominent person ever came to visit. The next day, it was discovered that he had simply strolled aimlessly, with no destination, occasionally inserting himself into lively scenes, or spending six cash on a bowl of tea. His footsteps never touched the so-called offices or yamens. He would return at dusk, and his answers would be the same. The shopkeeper, observing from the sidelines, was clear about the situation and advised the father, "Judging from your son's actions, he is making many false claims. Just take his visits to the yamens as proof. If one thing is false, the rest are likely to be false too. Do not let greed cloud your judgment and fall into the trap of a scoundrel." The father suddenly realized the truth and gave the young man the cold shoulder. The young man, knowing that his scheme had been exposed, did not return to the Guang Mao Residence, but went to Yang Village, where he used sweet words to borrow some foreign money from his uncle and sister and fled.

### Forty-Five Percent and One Fold

— Wei Se

This time, the public bus fare has increased again. On the surface, it has risen from four cents to five cents per stop, which is an increase of one-fourth of the original fare, and it does not seem excessive. But in fact, the company has doubled the fare, which may seem unbelievable, and the newspapers have not paid attention to this point. Now I will prove it with facts:

Before the 15th, the fare for one stop was four cents, two stops was five cents, and three stops was six cents. What about now? One stop is five cents, but two stops jump to eight cents, and three stops jump to twelve cents. Compared with the original six cents, isn't that a difference of one fold? Every day I take the No. 9 bus from the intersection of Avenue Foch and Route Tenant to Avenue Edan, which is exactly three stops, and the fare is six cents. But now it has risen to twelve cents. Has our income ever increased by one fold like this?

In the past two years in Shanghai, prices have been rising constantly, but it is really frightening that the public bus fare has increased by 100%, and on the surface, it is still claiming to have only increased by 45%.

"Price increase" has already become an "accomplished fact," right? But between 45% and one fold, I hope the company authorities will carefully investigate this "price list." This is the lowest demand, and we are waiting for an honest reply.

### Living with Illness

— Chen Xinkui

The vast city of Shanghai nominally has a population of about four million, but in reality, if a careful investigation is conducted, I am afraid that the number of citizens who meet the health standards would not exceed half. In other words, there are more than two million citizens who are living with illness.

Just being able to eat and not feeling bloated in the stomach does not mean that one is a healthy person. A truly healthy person, apart from other conditions, must have all parts of the body in good working order: the limbs, torso, bones, brain, internal organs, nerves, blood, muscles, skin, hair, and nails must all be sound and flexible, without the slightest defect. People whose teeth often ache or whose toes always itch at night cannot be considered healthy. Even people who have no obvious signs of illness on the surface, but are not able to work for long periods of time, are easily tired, have an irregular appetite, and do not get enough sleep at night, cannot be classified as healthy.

People who live with illness not only suffer physically, but also feel threatened spiritually. How can there be any joy in living under pain and threat? Of course, no one wants to live with illness. There are many people in society who live with illness, and there are three reasons for this: (1) Some part of the body has been damaged, but the person is not aware of it; (2) The person knows that some part of their body has a problem, but they rely on their strong resistance and do not care; (3) The person knows that their illness is serious, but they are forced to work to make a living and cannot afford to see a doctor, so they can only watch their condition worsen day by day and resign themselves to fate.

Regarding the first type of people, if they are willing to have regular and thorough physical examinations and accept the doctor's guidance, taking medicine or recuperating, it is easiest to restore their health. Regarding the second type of people, if they can consult a doctor, the disease is also easy to eliminate; otherwise, concealing the illness is like committing slow suicide, and sooner or later they will suffer the consequences. As for the third type of people who are sick but cannot afford to see a doctor, they make up the largest number of patients. Their situation is most worthy of sympathy. Unfortunately, the current society is based on the worship of money. Whether it is hospitals, doctors, pharmacies, or drugstores, their greatest purpose is to make money. At most, they only use humanitarianism as a signboard. Therefore, poor people who are sick rarely have the opportunity to come into contact with medicine. Even if there are charitable clinics, there are very few completely free opportunities, and the treatment is not very thorough or effective.

Since "people" have the freedom to live, they should have the freedom to be healthy. At present, humans only have the "freedom to be sick."

### New Stimuli

— Bu Ren

"Behind the vermilion gates, meat and wine go to waste, while on the road, corpses of the frozen starve to death." The present Shanghai is just a portrayal of these two sentences. The big restaurants are full of guests every day, and a table of dishes costing 100 yuan is considered ordinary. But the "dregs of humanity" who wait for several hours every day to receive two steamed buns are said to have reached 1.88 million in three months. Moreover, because they cannot even grab two steamed buns, they die of hunger and cold. Seeing that the trucks that come out of the Pushan Villa every day are fully loaded, there is no need to count these numbers.

However, these extremely few people are still appealing for relief. It seems that everyone else has not seen it (not because of nearsightedness, but because they are unwilling to waste their "eyesight"). They spend their leisurely twenty-four hours every day in casinos, dance halls, and theaters. But we can still hear them shouting "loneliness" because they need new stimuli.

Naturally, this "loneliness" must be resolved. For example, one day they will close the door, sit on the sofa, and play with a Pekingese dog to their heart's content. If they are tired of watching human dramas, watching dog dramas is also a way to adjust. Moreover, the grand occasion of "Haijingbo" is still deeply imprinted on their minds. So, five hundred pounds of beef, thirty loads of vegetables, and five hundred chickens make people excited because, judging from this daily food consumption, playing with Pekingese dogs on the sofa is even more extravagant.

Counting the days on their fingers, it is probably right now. However, this huge consumption may force people with empty stomachs to roll under the "horse's" belly to commit suicide. Can this "drama outside the drama" be said to be a killjoy, because this is what they do not want to see.

### One-Sided Eggs

— Li Ren

Recently, the catering company that we contract with often uses eggs to make dishes. At first, we liked it very much because it is nutritious and delicious! However, later, there were eggs at almost every meal, which made us suspicious. Because eggs now cost more than a dime each, the catering company would never give us such expensive things at every meal. Later, I asked the person who delivered the meals. At first, he just smiled without answering. Later, after I repeatedly asked him, he said: "These are egg yolks bought from biscuit companies, and the price is very cheap." Ah! The catering company is using such a clever trick! Think about it, if the protein has been extracted by the biscuit company for making biscuits, then wouldn't these dregs be of no benefit at all? Now that prices are high, this of course makes the catering company cut corners, but we don't necessarily have to eat meat. If we eat this kind of "one-sided egg," we would rather eat vegetables and tofu.

### Jesus' Concept of Gratitude (3)

Jesus was like this. During the Last Supper, he firmly took the cup and gave thanks. He knew that the road ahead was rugged and difficult, but he also knew that it was the way to glory and reward because this journey would allow him to obtain eternal life. Jesus faced all the hardships and expectations of life with a joyful attitude, never turning back and never changing. This is the reason for his great personality and the origin of his grateful heart. Isaiah 45:2 says, "I will give you the treasures of darkness." This "you" refers to Cyrus. It means that Cyrus obtained glorious victory through adversity. From this sentence, we can think that anyone who is willing to fight can discover many treasures on the path of life. This is the gospel of the cross and Golgotha. It contains the beauty of words and the power of life. The British poet Tennyson wrote these words from experience: Life is not a mine of idleness, but a mine of iron, to be mined from the darkness, tempered with tears, and forged with blows. He himself was a great poet forged in this way. A joyful person, by striving to face and overcome his adverse environment, often becomes a person of great spiritual power. The most grateful people in the world are those who are willing to face the hardships of life and endure all the tempering of life. They can also see that in the darkness of life, there are endless treasures. Because of the various tribulations they have experienced, a sense of self-confidence and joy naturally arises in the depths of their hearts, transforming their ordinary lives into meaningful lives. In misfortune, gratitude can be produced. Therefore, we must have the experience of facing life, and then we will have true gratitude. There are countless people who are suffering and cannot see anything to be grateful for, but because of this misfortune, they can find true treasures. We should be grateful for this and imitate Jesus in thanking God for suffering. In gratitude, we can gain the courage to win in life. (End) If you want to study in detail, please write to P.O. Box 1227.

Chapter 23: Old Friends and New Companions, Writing Has Value; Famous Scenic Spots, Management Finds the Right People

Let's continue. Zhai Wushuang, because he was talking about the newspaper office's side businesses, distinguished between publications and non-publications. Among the publications, they had various periodicals, magazines, standalone books, Chinese and foreign maps, and so on. Each year, the income from the publications was considerable. At that time, Wu Junsu asked, "Then what are the non-publications?" Zhai Wushuang said, "There are also many types of non-publications. Recently, our film business has also been very developed!" Zhai Wushuang, speaking to that point, pointed at Shao Huihua and said, "Oh! I almost forgot! We also have our movie star here." Shao Huihua said, "Okay! Okay! Don't talk nonsense! Continue with your story." Zhai Wushuang said, "Actually, we don't run any film companies, nor do we shoot any feature films. The films we shoot are mostly short films. For example, those about scenery, academics, industry, and customs are all called newsreels. At first, we shot a few reels of film, which were originally just shown to the people in our own newspaper office. Later, some people borrowed them to show them, and gradually they spread outside, and other places came to request them. So our newspaper office simply set up a film department. Whenever there are tours, sports meets, expositions, competitions, concerts, etc., held across the country during good days in spring and autumn, we send people to film them. In addition, if there are academic inventions that need to be shown through film, or if it's about a major domestic industry, such as the launching of a giant ship, the completion of a large bridge, airplane races, or realistic portrayals of mines, we also go to film them. As for the customs films of various borders and inland areas, we have also shot quite a few, which were commissioned by the Folk Customs Survey Committee. So recently, after each type of newsreel is produced, various places request them, some are pre-ordered, and some are purchased on the spot. Generally, when we produce a newsreel, we print many copies. So our side business of film news is quite developed. There is also another side business called the agency department, and the establishment of this agency department was also gradually successful. At first, a few writers published a few self-printed works and entrusted our newspaper office to sell them on their behalf. Later, a few inventors invented several new scientific instruments, and because it was not cost-effective for them to set up their own distribution departments, they also entrusted our newspaper office to distribute them on their behalf. These were all agreed to out of friendship. Who knew that the business of entrusting us to be their agent would become more and more numerous, and people all trusted us. We had no choice but to set up another agency location and assign a few more employees, and we even set up a sample room!" (265)

Entertainment Circle

### Jin Shaoshan and the Hegemon

— Xi Sen

According to a Tianjin dispatch, Jin Shaoshan recently performed at the China Grand Theater, collaborating with Yan Huizhu and Zhou Ruian. The highest price for a ticket was one dollar and sixty cents, and for the play "Farewell My Concubine," an additional thirty cents was temporarily added to the ticket price. The posters were put up, and the tickets were sold out in no time. Jin Shaoshan's current fame and momentum are truly overwhelming, and certainly cannot be compared to when he was confined to the south!

The role of the Hegemon, played by martial arts actors, since the passing of Yang Lao Jiang, Zhou Ruian should be considered the best. Although Ruian's expression and performance are not as robust as Lao Jiang's, and his voice is not as crisp as Lao Jiang's, his tall stature and generous demeanor are still a typical choice. Therefore, when Kunqu Opera actresses perform "Farewell My Concubine" in the capital, they mostly pair with Ruian as the Hegemon, which shows that Ruian is also most skilled in the role of the Hegemon. The next best is Sun Yukun. Around 1929 and 1930, Yukun co-performed "Farewell My Concubine" with Xue Yanqin. At that time, Yukun was at his peak, and Yang Lao Jiang even considered him a disciple capable of carrying on his legacy. Although he later nearly declined for a time, since Lao Jiang passed away, Yukun has been quite interested in revitalizing, so in terms of martial arts actors playing the Hegemon, besides Ruian, Yukun is truly hopeful of succeeding Lao Jiang.

Among the rising martial arts actors, Gao Shenglin's skills are not weak, but unfortunately, his stature is relatively small, so it seems unsuitable for him to play the Hegemon. It is said that the child actor Chuan Dewei plays this role, and the Pingju circles in the capital say that he has the demeanor of a "little Hegemon among little Hegemons," so this child's future may also be promising.

Among Jing (painted-face) actors playing the Hegemon, Jin Shaoshan is the most famous. Outside of Jin, Liu Lianrong's skills are also not weak, and his voice is excellent, but unfortunately, his stature is not as majestic as Jin's, so when he co-performs with Dr. Mei, he always has to rely on thick-soled boots. Yuan Shihai also became famous for playing the Hegemon among the rising actors. Next are Sun Shengwen and Su Lianhan, who can perform steadily without flaws, but compared to Shaoshan, they are far inferior. It is appropriate that Shaoshan looks down upon the theater world with the air of the Hegemon and sees no one else in his eyes. There is a reason for increasing ticket prices. As for Chen Furui's oily Hegemon, Zhao Deyu's milk Hegemon, Ye Shengmao's soft Hegemon, Kunqu actress Wang Qingkui, Zhang Zishou's female Hegemon, and Kunqu Opera troupe Hou Yilong's old Hegemon, they are almost farcical and inevitably disrespectful to the hero! Sakyamuni Starts Filming New China's Film Agreement

### Silver Screen Anecdotes

— Hai Xing

Sakyamuni Starts Filming New China's Film Agreement "Yanmen Pass" has been completed, and preparations are now underway to begin filming "Sakyamuni." It is tentatively scheduled to lead a location shooting crew to India in three months to capture the scenery of the Buddhist kingdom. The female lead was originally set to be Chen Yunshang, but now there may be changes. It is planned to invite Shani, the young daughter of the martial artist Lang Deshan, who has traveled around the world, to take on the role. It is said that Miss Shani has a long face, a high nose, and a slender figure, quite in the style of a Westerner. What's more valuable is that she is skilled in classical dance, which is exactly what is needed in "Sakyamuni." It is said that Shani is quite interested in appearing on the silver screen, but she cannot speak fluent Mandarin, which may be an obstacle to the future of negotiations.

Yunshang Telegraphed Shanghai for Leave Chen Yunshang was originally scheduled to return to Shanghai around the 20th of this month, but yesterday a telegram was sent to Zhang Shankun requesting a postponement, because the film being shot in Hong Kong has not yet been completed, but it did not specify which film. As far as reporters know, the film in which Chen is starring in Hong Kong is "The Flirtatious Empress" ("Liang Hongwang") is still in preparation. Zhang sent a reply telegram, asking her to stay for a few more days.

Wang Xichun Will Return to Shanghai Yesterday, Wang Yin sent a letter to the reporter, which contained a rather interesting passage: "Today, I went to the toilet in the Gloucester Tea Room twice, and both times I ran into Mei Lanfang also urinating. It was really coincidental. Mei Lanfang has gained a lot of weight. Standing next to me, I looked carefully at the wrinkles on his forehead. He didn't shave off all the stubble on his palms. He doesn't look like he will sing female roles anymore."

According to reports from Hong Kong friends: Wang Xichun is scheduled to return to Shanghai by ship on the 17th and should arrive around the 20th.

### Tang Ruoqing Will Return to Shanghai

It was previously rumored that Tang Ruoqing was going abroad, but this statement has been confirmed to be incorrect. Ruoqing will return to Shanghai from Hong Kong next week. There are two reasons for Ruoqing's early return to Shanghai: one is that Huaiqiu will be holding a memorial service for his deceased father at the Jing'an Temple next Friday, and the granddaughter should arrive. The second is that China Travel will be staging the historical drama "Wen Tianxiang," and Ruoqing will play one of Wen Tianxiang's two daughters with Ruoying. It is also rumored that a certain film company intends to invite Ruoqing to appear on the silver screen, but this matter will have to wait until she returns to Shanghai to be decided.

Actress Yao Ping, who went to Hong Kong on the same ship as Chen Yunshang, etc., has already gone to Kunming with photographer Chen Xihuan last month to work in the film industry because she had no development in Hong Kong.

Li Qinian Recently Sent a Letter to Friends in Shanghai, Saying That She Can Come to Shanghai to Work in Mid-May. It is Said That Li's First Work After Joining Yihua is Scheduled to Be the Historical Costume Film "Sister Daji", and Li Will Play the Role of (Daji).

### Unofficial Records of the Pear Garden

— Xu Muyun

Hua Yun in "Battle of Taiping" is a Mistake for Hua Yun (Part 2)

Unfortunately, the character in the play who introduces himself insists on "being flowery rather than flourishing". Reasoning and logic absolutely do not allow him to mispronounce his surname. Therefore, the "Hua" character must be sung in the even tone. Some people say that in ancient characters, "Hua" (花) and "Hua" (華), "Jing" (景) and "Ying" (影), "Shi" (史) and "Shi" (事) were indistinguishable. Jing Gu Lonely Blood, if I were to call them Ying Mei Jiu, Ying Gu Lonely Blood, I'm afraid I would be scolded. If I write Shi Kefa as Shi Kefa, I would be spanked even more. When I first talked about "Battle of Taiping," I wanted to correct the error of "Hua" (花) and "Hua" (華), but at that time, I wanted to preserve the good melody of the three characters "General Hua Yun," and I was afraid that changing the tones of the characters would change the melody, which would be a pity. Who knew that after many days of studying and pondering, I actually found that singing the "Hua" sound was even more pleasant to the ear. I just changed the silent "ah" sound under the character "Hua" to three silent "ah" sounds under the character "Hua." When singing, it goes from low to high, and then from high to low (that is, the first and third "ah" characters are low, and the middle character is high). Also, when the "Hua" sound is produced, it goes from low and slow to high and urgent. The moment the last silent "ah" sound is produced, it connects to singing the character "Yun." Not only is the surname not wrong and the character not reversed, but it is also low and roundabout, with a vigorousness that contains the subtlety of immediate release and recovery. As for the "Jiaohua An Yu Fu Dai Zuoqi" in the previous section "Biejia," it is more appropriate to use the "Hua" sound under the character "An." If you sing the "Hua" character, then the tune under the character "An" will not come out. What do you think of this?
