### Halifax Appointed as Envoy to the U.S., Partial Cabinet Reshuffle in Britain: Eden Appointed Foreign Secretary, Margesson Appointed War Secretary; Britain's Attitude Towards the Far East to Become More Assertive

London, Reuters Diplomatic Correspondent reports: Following the appointment of the current Foreign Secretary, Lord Halifax, to the important position of British Ambassador to the United States, he is scheduled to depart for Washington to assume his new duties in early January. His wife will accompany him. Meanwhile, the newly appointed Foreign Secretary, Eden, has already taken office today. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)

London, No. 10 Downing Street, the following announcement has been issued: "His Majesty the King has graciously approved the following appointments: Viscount Halifax as Ambassador to Washington, Eden as Foreign Secretary, David Margesson as War Secretary, and has graciously bestowed the title of Lord upon Cranborne (Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs)." The dispatch of the current Foreign Secretary as an Ambassador is unprecedented and fully demonstrates Britain's special relationship with the United States. The elevation of Cranborne to the peerage aims to supplement the government's representation in the House of Lords. Cranborne will also serve as the spokesperson for the Foreign Office in the House of Lords. Following the announcement of this new initiative, it is widely rumored that Prime Minister Churchill is considering another partial cabinet reshuffle in the near future, ideally before the Christmas holiday. Potential candidates may include former Prime Minister Lloyd George, who may be assigned a ministerial portfolio without specific responsibilities, or tasks related to food or armament production. Eden's policies are expected to be very assertive towards Italy and Spain, and he will employ any forceful measures to overthrow Fascist rule. However, regarding the Italian people, it is expected that a pro-democratic system will be the solution. Regarding the Far East, Eden has always advocated strong cooperation with the United States and vigorously supporting China. While Halifax holds the same attitude, Eden's actions in Asia and other areas are expected to be even more energetic. (Associated Press dispatch, 23rd)

London, Lord Halifax has recently been appointed as Ambassador to the United States, and his vacated position as Foreign Secretary has been filled by War Secretary Eden. Captain Margesson has been appointed as the new War Secretary. Lord Halifax entered the cabinet in 1921 and served as Governor-General of India in 1925. In 1938, he succeeded Eden as Foreign Secretary and has held the position until now. Before his long tenure in foreign affairs, he served as Minister of Education, Minister of Agriculture, and War Secretary. He is currently 59 years old. Eden was only 34 years old when he first served as Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and he attended League of Nations meetings and disarmament conferences with Sir John Simon for three years. In 1935, he participated in talks with Hitler and visited the capitals of the Soviet Union, Poland, and Czechoslovakia to discuss diplomatic and disarmament issues. When the Italian invasion of Abyssinia occurred, Eden strongly advocated economic sanctions in the League of Nations, and the partial implementation of these sanctions was due to his efforts. At the end of that year, Foreign Secretary Hoare resigned, and Eden took over the foreign affairs portfolio. At the young age of 38, he held the important position of Foreign Secretary, which is rare in British history. In 1938, dissatisfied with former Prime Minister Chamberlain's appeasement policy, he resolutely resigned. When the war broke out, Eden rejoined the cabinet as Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.

### The Pope Grieves Over Human Disaster

Vatican City, Pope Pius XII recently sent a letter to Vatican Secretary of State Cardinal Maglione, expressing his grief over the suffering of Christians and, in particular, the plight of displaced and suffering children. The letter stated, "Although I have tried my best to alleviate human spiritual and physical suffering, all efforts have been ineffective, which I deeply regret. However, this failure is not only caused by the current circumstances but also by deliberate obstruction by human forces." (Havas dispatch, 22nd) In May of that year, Churchill became Prime Minister, appointing Eden as War Secretary. Now, he has once again taken over the foreign affairs portfolio. Captain Margesson has been representing the Treasury in Parliament since 1931 and also serves as the Chief Whip of the Government Party in Parliament. Apart from the Speaker, the Chief Whip is the most influential and responsible position in Parliament. Margesson's handling of parliamentary affairs in this role is highly regarded. He entered Parliament in 1922 and is currently 50 years old. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)

London, Dominion Secretary Lord Cranborne has been granted the title of Baron. There will be no further changes in the government at present. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)

New York, Bloom, a member of the U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee, stated that the news of the appointment of British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax as the new Ambassador to the United States is extremely gratifying. After former Ambassador Lothian, Halifax is the most ideal person to establish a good relationship between Britain and the United States. (Haitong dispatch, 23rd)

### The U.S. Strengthens Philippine Defense with 50 Million Gold Dollars: Defense Industry Enters Wartime Basis; Labor-Management Cooperation, Production Costs Disregarded

Washington, The Associated Press learned today that U.S. defense officials are currently planning to accelerate the defense of the Philippines and allocate over 50 million yuan for military equipment. The U.S. Congress may draw this amount from the two sums currently authorized for the return of taxes and the repayment of gold valuations to the Philippines. Sources familiar with the matter stated that Philippine President Quezon has informed U.S. officials that he is very willing to allocate these funds for the defense of the Philippine Islands. In fact, President Quezon had expressed this willingness several months ago, but it was frustrated by the U.S. insistence that these defense expenditures should be supervised by U.S. defense leaders. U.S. officials believe that defense plans should adapt to current international developments and that the United States has the responsibility to defend the Philippines before Philippine independence in 1946. Therefore, these defense expenditures should be handled by U.S. Army and Navy officials. It is now reported that the Philippine President has agreed to the U.S. proposal, and the overall plan is currently awaiting a decision by the Joint Army and Navy Defense Committee. (Associated Press dispatch, 13th)

Houston, Commerce Secretary Jones predicted that the U.S. defense industry will soon operate on a 24-hour basis, and the amount of expenditure will be disregarded. "We hope that war will never come to our country, but it would be extremely foolish not to prepare for it." (Associated Press dispatch, 23rd)

Washington, Knudsen, the chairman of the newly established U.S. National Defense Advisory Commission, issued a statement to reporters yesterday, stating that the crisis that led to the establishment of the U.S. National Defense Advisory Commission is irreconcilable and cannot be eliminated by any appeasement methods. The United States is deeply aware of the seriousness of the world situation and recognizes that the disputes caused by irreconcilable differences cannot be resolved by appeasement. Therefore, this National Defense Advisory Commission was established. In the future, the security of the United States and the maintenance of democracy in the world war will depend on capitalists contributing all their resources and laborers contributing their greatest efforts to continuously manufacture tools for defense and offense. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)

Washington, It was announced yesterday that the U.S. Navy has ordered a number of submarines, submarine chasers, and auxiliary ships, totaling US$284 million. Among the auxiliary ships ordered, four are used to lay anti-submarine nets in important ports. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)

Editorial

### Prospects of the European Situation

German troops have entered Italian territory, preparing to be deployed to the Albanian front to assist in the war effort. According to a dispatch from the International News Service in Rome, the Italian government has confirmed this. It is evident that the Italian Blackshirts are in a rather critical position; otherwise, why would Hitler suddenly change his plans after nearly two months of hesitation and empty talk of neutrality? According to the Italian government's explanation, the German troops are assisting in the war effort based on the principle of joint action by the Axis powers, "exchanging manpower and material resources." This is truly a "sophistical argument concealing the truth." Firstly, if the two sides truly intended to "exchange," it seems that it should have been implemented before or shortly after the outbreak of the war against Greece, and it should not have "arrived late" only when the Blackshirts had suffered several defeats, giving the impression of begging for help after defeat. Secondly, between two Axis powers claiming to be equal, such as Germany and Italy, each should independently shoulder responsibilities on the front lines and only exchange information and resources in the rear. This would resemble an exchange, and it would certainly not require directly sending tens of thousands of army troops into the territory of the other party, which is not a combat zone. In fact, the battlefield is not in mainland Italy but in Albania, across the Adriatic Sea, or even in North Africa, far across the ocean. Although it is said that German troops cannot directly enter Italy because Bulgaria and Yugoslavia do not allow them to pass through, such deployment to provide assistance, the actual war results of which are still difficult to foresee, has already raised various doubts, believing that the purpose of the German troops entering northern Italy is not to help the Blackshirts fight but to monitor the future actions of the Roman government and suppress the anti-fascist brewing within Italy. For several days, there have been repeated rumors of Italy making a separate peace, and there are signs of internal political instability. This view may not necessarily correspond to the facts, but regardless of the motives and methods of the Nazi troops entering Italy, the prestige of the Roman Empire will plummet, which cannot be denied.

Accompanying the news of the German troops entering Italy, there are also several pieces of news related to the European situation that are worth paying great attention to. The first is Germany's intensification of coercion against the Pétain government. According to a Reuters dispatch, Germany seems to have made the following demands to Vichy: (1) Allow Germany to use French ports along the Mediterranean coast; (2) Allow German troops to pass through Italy; (3) The government must move back to Nazi-controlled Paris; (4) Dismiss all senior officials who oppose Franco-German cooperation and reappoint Laval, who is thoroughly pro-German. If the Pétain government accepts these demands, it will effectively become Germany's vanguard in the war against Britain, deepening the degree of its descent compared to the armistice agreement in June of this year. This is certainly not what the old General Pétain, who claims to be saving the country, would like to do. He is currently "arguing with Germany on the basis of reason," which is imaginable, and in his negotiations, in addition to the allegiance of the navy and overseas territories, it seems that the support of the United States is also a talisman that can be borrowed. It is very interesting that President Roosevelt does not hesitate to send a general-level envoy to defeated and subjugated France, and even ordered him to bring a secret letter to Pétain.

Secondly, the deterioration of relations between the United States and Germany, although expected for some time, recently Germany suddenly used the opportunity of the United States considering confiscating the detained German ships to issue a strong warning to Washington, implying that it may consider this action by the United States as an "act of war." At a time when the United States is preparing to step up aid to Britain, although it has stated that it will not change its plans because of Germany's attitude, it cannot be said that this is not a noteworthy response. Because, up to now, Germany has not taken any active action regarding the United States' public aid to Britain, except for a warning in the alliance signed with Italy and Japan on September 27. This time, because the United States government has the possibility of transferring more than 90 ships from Germany, Italy, and France to Britain for use, it has shown a bit of "anxiety." Assuming that the Washington government disregards Germany's opposition and still confiscates these ships and lends them to Britain for use, will Germany truly declare war on the United States? After Germany declares war on the United States, will its two allies, Italy and Japan, also "follow suit"? This is indeed a very important issue. In any case, judging from the news coming from the United States, Washington seems to be ignoring Germany's warning. On the contrary, relations between Britain and the United States are only becoming closer. The British government's appointment of the dignified Foreign Secretary as Ambassador to the United States at least implies how much Churchill values diplomacy with the United States, and the long-term stay of a British Treasury official in Washington is further evidence of Britain's eagerness for the United States to step up assistance. Under these circumstances, the future evolution of U.S.-German relations is truly very important.

Comprehensive analysis of the several trends mentioned above, namely the entry of German troops into Italy, the Franco-German negotiations, and the worsening of U.S.-German relations, is sufficient to reveal a major revelation about the current European situation. In other words, since France's surrender in June of this year, the Axis powers have exhausted their efforts to "rush left and right" in order to quickly end the war, but alas, all military offensives, political offensives, diplomatic offensives, and even peace offensives have failed. According to the principle that "the ruling class of an aggressor nation must rely on external victories to maintain its position," it now seems to have reached a point where it cannot help but take "risky moves." As for what card Hitler will play next, that is another question.

Italian troops were driven out of their main position on Mount Khimara and retreated northward, attempting to defend a new coastal line south of the port of Vlorë. The Greek radio station received a report from Hungary stating, "The fate of Tepelenë and Këlcyrë has been decided." These two cities are important strongholds in south-central Albania. The radio station stated that Greek troops near Tepelenë seized defensive positions. The report from the Hungarian radio station stated that the Italian counterattack near Këlcyrë had collapsed. In the battle of Tepelenë, the Italian troops suffered heavy casualties. The Greek side claims that the wounded are extremely numerous, and many spoils of war were obtained, including ten field guns. The Greek radio station stated, "All strongholds are in the hands of the Greek troops, and the situation is extremely favorable." News from "exchanged telegrams" in London stated that Greek forces on the front line shot down eighteen Italian aircraft yesterday. The report stated that Khimara is currently under Greek artillery fire. (December 23rd, United Press report)

Athens: The Greek advance along the Adriatic coast has reached within twenty-five miles of Vlorë, a major Italian base port. The port has been heavily bombed by the British naval and air forces. Mountain passes of military importance and other locations near Tepelenë, after a month of fighting, were occupied yesterday. The two armies are currently fighting in three feet of snow. The mountain artillery units covering the Italian retreat have been defeated. The Italian troops, in addition to losing artillery and other military supplies, have suffered heavy casualties. Yesterday, Greek fighters and ground machine gun units shot down a total of eighteen Italian aircraft. (December 23rd, Reuters report)

Struga: According to border reports, Greek soldiers, after fierce fighting, occupied three villages in three different war zones yesterday. This is the first advance by Greek troops in several days since the Italian troops reinforced their forces. On the coastal front, Greek troops occupied the village of Bojana, seven kilometers northeast of Frashër, this morning after fierce fighting. On the Tomorrica front, Greek troops occupied the village of Romas, two kilometers west of Tomorrica and twenty kilometers from Berat, where the Italian central headquarters in Albania is located. On the Grammos front, Greek troops occupied the village of Fulqeri. In the battle of Tuperlik, it is claimed that Greek troops defeated the Italian troops at Domosdova and advanced another two kilometers. (December 23rd, United Press report)

### Greek Troops Attack on Three Sides - Italian Reinforcements Surrounded

Athens: The Athens press claims that Greek troops today have gradually surrounded three Italian divisions and their reinforcing fresh troops, trapping them around Tepelenë and Këlcyrë. It is claimed that these three Italian divisions consist of 50,000 men, but there are no reliable reports on the number of reinforcements. Greek troops are currently attacking the Italian troops on three sides. However, another message arriving here states that Greek troops, due to the stubborn resistance of the Italian troops, have delayed their operations for several days. They are now forcefully pressing forward on all fronts. The war between Greek troops in Tepelenë and Këlcyrë continues unabated. It is reported that the Italian troops, in addition to increasing their troops, are also using waves of bombers and fighters to suppress them in order to stop the Greek advance. Personnel from the Greek Ministry of the Army claim that "the war continues to proceed effectively. Two lieutenant colonels are among the captured Italian troops." The Security Department also stated that everything is quiet in the Greek mainland. According to earlier news, Italian troops have been driven out of the positions in the Khimara mountains and have fled north in order to establish defenses in the new coastal positions south of Vlorë and defend them. (December 23rd, United Press report)

London: The Athens Domestic Security Department announced today that, according to reports from local authorities, five prominent Greek figures have been kidnapped by Italian troops from Thesprotia as hostages. (December 23rd, Reuters report)

Athens: After fierce labor by the Greek troops advancing on the entire southern line in central Albania, the Italian troops, under the fierce bombardment of the Greek artillery, could not withstand and retreated. It is rumored that they abandoned Khimara this morning. An extremely conservative Greek communiqué today stated, "Our troops have achieved local victories in several war zones, and captured some Italian troops, including two lieutenant colonels." However, according to unofficial authoritative sources, the elite Italian troops guarding the strategic triangle of Khimara, Tepelenë, and Këlcyrë have abandoned the defense of the entire coastal area under heavy bombardment and completely collapsed towards Vlorë. The Italian losses are great, and a large number of equipment have been abandoned. The war report stated that the Italian counterattacks in the triangle were fierce. The Greek troops must repel the counterattacks everywhere before they can continue to advance. However, there is no doubt that the Italian resistance has failed today. The Italian troops retreated completely late last night, so the Greek troops have been able to tighten the encirclement around Tepelenë and Këlcyrë. It is also rumored that a large number of Italian reinforcements have landed in Vlorë. According to the battles around Këlcyrë, they are particularly fierce, as that place is an important transportation hub. The Italian troops are making every effort to reinforce the area and have repeatedly counterattacked, but most of them have suffered losses and have been repelled.

### British Naval and Air Forces Heavily Bomb Bardia - Army Also Concentrating in Large Numbers - To Make Final Attack

Cairo: British troops operating in North Africa appeared to be concentrating in large numbers yesterday to make a final decisive attack on Bardia. The British side has not officially announced any new developments, but the headquarters issued a statement saying that British troops are driving aid towards the Bardia area in a calm and continuous manner in order to "launch a major offensive." At the same time, several British warships are bombarding Bardia from the sea, and the Royal Air Force is also actively operating in the area. There is currently no new development regarding the news of Italian reinforcements in Bardia. The British announcement stated that British troops have seized seven large guns from the recently occupied Italian positions. There has been no change in other strongholds. (December 23rd, United Press report)

London: According to news here this morning, Bardia, a strategically important military base for the Italian troops in Libya, is still in Italian hands. There is no reason to believe that the fall of the city is imminent. (December 23rd, Reuters report)

Italian Governor of Africa Reports on the War Situation

Rome: Italian Governor of Africa General Graziani, in a report to the Italian Prime Minister yesterday, stated, "The outcome of this extensive war cannot be predicted. The British armored vehicle fleet attacking Bardia can only sit and waste time, the reason being the bravery of the Italian troops in responding to the war." He also stated, "The war between the British and Italian armies is extremely brutal. Several Italian teams were completely destroyed in the battle of Barani in the northwest and elsewhere. The British surprise attack there did not come as a surprise to the Italian army. However, the number of British armored vehicle teams was too large, forcing the Italian army to retreat in an orderly manner. The battle of Bardia is still ongoing." He also said, "The assistance of the British air force and navy is extremely important, while the activities of the Italian planes are difficult due to the influence of the large desert. Forty-two British planes have been confirmed to have been shot down, and another twenty have been shot down. The British surprise attack came several days earlier than the Italian plan to launch an attack on Marsa Matruh. (December 23rd, United Press report)

### British Bomber Groups Launch Extensive Night Raids - Hundreds of Tons of Bombs Dropped Across Six Countries - Italian Inland Port of Maghera Bombed

London: British bombers launched the most extensive air raid of this war on Saturday night, dropping hundreds of tons of bombs across six countries. From Oslo in Norway to Venice in Italy, all were bombed. This was the first attack on Venice. The British aircraft flew 1,600 miles round trip, the longest journey ever made. The British aircraft also bombed targets in Germany, Italy, Norway, the Netherlands, Belgium, and France. All British aircraft departed from the British mainland, taking advantage of the second-longest night of the year (the night before the winter solstice) for long-distance flights. The Air Ministry stated that the bombs dropped in Venice were extremely large and the results were very good. The British aircraft arrived there at 11:30 pm and left at midnight, with many bombs hitting docks and factories, causing large fires. However, one pilot reported that he did not fly over the city of Venice. The Air Ministry stated that only one British aircraft did not return from all the missions of the night. (December 23rd, United Press report)

London: The Air Ministry Intelligence Office stated that British heavy bombers launched their first attack on Venice, Italy, on Saturday night. One target was Maghera, an inland port near a railway bridge on a lake in Venice. The port has docks and oil factories, which the Italian side believed were beyond the reach of British aircraft. However, the British aircraft flew over 1,600 miles to bomb it. The first batch of British aircraft arrived and immediately dropped bombs on the target area, causing fires in several places. It is already a feat of skilled aviation technology and endurance to bomb Milan, Italy, which is closer to Britain. Attacking Venice, which is even further away, requires overcoming many new difficulties in order to complete the mission. (December 23rd, Reuters report)

### Hundreds of German Aircraft Heavily Bomb London - Losses Significant

London: According to news here this morning, British Air Force bombers attacked Mannheim in the Upper Rhine again last night, destroying two docks and two railway car parks.

According to the Air Ministry, the losses were significant, and there were some casualties. (December 23rd, Reuters report)

London: Manchester was subjected to the most intense air raid ever last night. After hours of bombing, a stream of black smoke soared into the sky this morning. The air raid began after dark. German aircraft flew in from the south and formed a fan-shaped formation over a large area, first dropping flares, followed by incendiary bombs. The city's fire brigade was dispatched in full force from the start of the air raid to be on standby. Several large fires could be seen miles away. The number of casualties is currently unknown. The fires have almost been extinguished this morning. (December 23rd, Reuters report)

London: Last night and this morning, hundreds of German bombers heavily bombed a city in northwestern England for hours, dropping thousands of incendiary and high-explosive bombs, with the central area suffering the most damage. After the bombing, numerous large fires broke out in the city, causing significant damage to buildings and shops. There are reports of countless deaths and injuries. London's second night air raid siren went off at 3:00 am this morning and was lifted at 6:30 am after two German planes were shot down. German aircraft groups also attacked the Merseyside area for several hours. In Liverpool, it is reported that only two people were killed and a few were injured. Four of those injured were firefighters who were injured by bombs falling nearby while fighting the fire. When several German planes flew over an area of London at 8:00 pm, they encountered intense artillery fire. At the same time, explosions were heard in the area. A town in the West Midlands was also bombed with high-explosive bombs, but the attackers were driven away by anti-aircraft guns. German aircraft were also heard flying over a town in the southwest and a town in Wales. At 7:00 pm yesterday, air raid warnings were widely sounded throughout Britain, such as Liverpool, a town in the northwest, two towns in the north, two towns in East Anglia, a town in the East Midlands, and a town in the West Midlands. The air raid alarm in London went off at 6:00 pm. According to the Air Ministry's communiqué, German planes dropped bombs in western Scotland during the day yesterday, causing minor damage. During the day yesterday, a Focke-Wulf 88 was shot down over southeastern England. On Saturday night, cities and towns in England and Wales were subjected to extensive air raids. London also suffered small-scale bombings. Liverpool was attacked after dusk last night and continued to be tense until this morning. After the bombing, many large fires broke out in the area, but the fire was controlled by the valiant efforts of the firefighters. Several commercial buildings and other buildings were damaged, and many people were killed and injured. The communiqué also stated that several buildings were damaged in the London area last night, and many civilians were killed and injured. Many incendiary bombs were dropped in the London area, and a school and many shops on a major city street were burned, but the fire was quickly controlled. Also, a public air raid shelter was destroyed on the outskirts of Birmingham. It is reported that the German planes attacked Birmingham for a long time. In the East and West Midlands, several incendiary and high-explosive bombs were dropped. In the West Midlands, a pub was hit during a wedding celebration. An anti-aircraft shell entered the pub through the window, injuring both the bride and groom. (December 23rd, United Press report)

### British House of Commons Bombed Three Times - Chamber Spared Destruction

London: According to currently available information, the House of Commons was damaged in the recent air raids, but the chamber itself was spared destruction.

### Swiss Territory in Yugoslavia Hit by Bombs, Losses Not Significant

Berne: Basel City was bombed by British planes on the evening of the 16th of this month. Last night, several foreign planes dropped bombs on Zurich. Zurich is located far inland, far from the border, making accidental bombing by foreign planes highly unlikely. Therefore, the people of Switzerland were greatly shocked upon hearing the news. According to the latest reports, the planes dropped a total of four bombs and many incendiary bombs. The target of the bombing was the cargo loading and unloading station and various railway facilities, similar to the bombing of Basel City. In terms of damage, one bomb destroyed a civilian house, killing and injuring two people. Another bomb destroyed a car garage (located next to the railway locomotive factory). A bomb near the cargo station injured several people. Another bomb landed on an elevated bridge, injuring eight road workers. In addition, five incendiary bombs landed near the Oerlikon engine factory and railway tracks, causing significant damage to the factory's generator. It is reported that several other bombs landed near Schlieren. Details are unknown. According to a statement issued by the General Staff, the bombing resulted in a total of eleven injuries. Passenger trains traveling to eastern Switzerland via Oerlikon or from eastern Switzerland are subject to restrictions within 24 hours due to track damage. (Havas News Agency, 23rd)

London: The Swiss Embassy here has been instructed by its government to lodge a strong protest with the British government regarding the violation of Swiss neutrality by foreign aircraft flying over Swiss airspace on the evenings of December 21st and 22nd and to demand compensation for losses. According to a statement from the Swiss Embassy, a thorough investigation has revealed that the aircraft were British and that the bombs dropped in Zurich on the 22nd were also of British origin. It also stated that compensation will be demanded for property damage and injuries to residents. Finally, it insisted that more effective measures be taken to prevent the recurrence of such incidents. (Reuters, 23rd)

Yugoslav Capital: It is reported from here that an air raid warning was issued in Fiume, Italy, at 11:55 PM on the 21st and lifted at 12:52 AM. After the alarm was issued, three British planes flew in from the south, two flying towards Trieste and the other circling over the town of Susak in Yugoslavia, dropping two heavy bombs in the square near the city hall. One bomb created a crater 12 meters in diameter and 3 meters deep, shattering nearby windows and injuring eight people. The other bomb landed in a wetland, causing no damage.

### Agenda of the Soviet Communist Party Congress Determined

Moscow: The Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party has decided to convene the 18th National Congress of the Soviet Communist Party on February 15, 1941 (the previous report of convening the Congress on January 15th was inaccurate). The agenda of the Congress includes the work of industrial and transportation Communist Party organizations and other organizational issues. (TASS, 23rd)

### Following Germany, Japan and Italy Threaten the US with Empty Words; If the US Helps Britain with Merchant Ships, the Three Countries Will Discuss This Issue

Tokyo: Ito, Director of the Cabinet Intelligence Bureau, stated that there will be no further changes to the cabinet for the time being and that the New Year holidays will be uneventful. The most important aspect of the cabinet reshuffle is Yanagawa's entry into the cabinet. Ito said that Prime Minister Konoe had created a system of cabinet advisors and recently appointed Araki as a cabinet advisor, but he declined the position due to various reasons. Rumors that Araki and Yanagawa both opposed the current cabinet are unfounded. Now that Yanagawa has joined the cabinet, this indirectly strengthens the cabinet. When asked if there was a partial reshuffle of the cabinet due to internal difficulties or tensions, Ito replied that there were no special internal difficulties or tensions at present. However, the 67th Diet session is about to open, and this is the first meeting of the new political structure. Therefore, the Prime Minister appointed a powerful figure as the press officer. The Minister of Justice has two responsibilities: one is the main judicial responsibility and the other is the responsibility for state affairs. Both are equally important. Regarding the Japan-Soviet fishery negotiations in Moscow, Ito replied that the negotiations are still ongoing but declined to reveal the results. A US visitor asked about the German government spokesman's statement after British Minister of Shipping Cross proposed on Friday that the United States increase its shipping assistance to Britain and force Axis ships docked in domestic ports to leave. The German government is now awaiting the US response. War and peace between Germany and the US are now uncertain. How does Japan feel about this threat? Ito's reply was ambiguous. He also said that he had not yet received formal information regarding the German spokesman's remarks. However, if the United States lends ships to Britain, the signatory countries of the Tripartite Pact will certainly discuss whether this act is tantamount to warfare. (Reuters, 23rd)

Washington: Today's New York Times reported that the US government is now considering authorizing Congress to requisition foreign ships detained in the United States and repeal the Neutrality Act to allow US ships to transport supplies to Britain. (Reuters, 23rd)

Rome: Guida reported in the Italian "Il Giornale d'Italia" yesterday that British Minister of Shipping Cross's proposal on Friday to transfer US ships to Britain would provoke the anger of the three Axis powers and drag the United States into war. Guida further stated that if Washington follows Cross's proposal and seizes Axis ships in US territorial waters for Britain, it will provoke the anger of the German-Italian-Japanese military alliance and drag the United States into the war. (Associated Press, 23rd)

### Rumors of Secret Negotiations Between Vichy and Germany; Cabinet Meeting to Discuss This Matter; Germany Orders Pétain to Move Back to Paris

Vichy: Extremely secret negotiations are currently underway between Vichy and Paris, mediated by Perrinon, the permanent representative of Vichy in Paris. This is a new development after the new Foreign Minister Flandin recovered from the flu. The French government refused to comment on the news that Germany demanded Laval's return to the cabinet and a major cabinet reshuffle. The previous plan was for Laval to become Vice President, take office in Paris, and Paris would continue to be occupied by German troops. Marshal Pétain would take office in Versailles, and the German troops would be allowed to withdraw from Versailles. However, since Pétain holds both the positions of Head of State and Prime Minister, it should be discussed whether Pétain should return to Versailles or Paris. The Germans want Pétain to return to Paris, but Pétain always wants to obtain absolute administrative freedom. Therefore, he agreed that he could return to Versailles once the German troops withdrew from that place, so as not to be accused by outsiders of being a prisoner of the German army. (Associated Press, 23rd)

Vichy: The Vichy cabinet, chaired by General Pétain, held its third cabinet meeting in three days on Sunday. (Reuters, 23rd)

Vichy: It is rumored that the Germans have concentrated thousands of troops on the demarcation line, the Morvan Line, between the occupied and unoccupied zones of France. However, after several hours, this news has not been confirmed. Therefore, the government here is now more at ease. (International News Service, 23rd)

### Italian Spy Executed

### Japanese Ambassador to the US, Nomura, Visits China

Tokyo: The newly appointed ambassador to the United States, Nomura, has left Japan for Northeast China. He will first visit Changchun, then transfer to Beijing and Nanjing, and arrive in Shanghai.

### Japanese Residents Unable to Operate in India; Over a Hundred People Have Returned to Moji

Moji: According to semi-official Japanese sources, a Mr. So-and-so, the head of the Mitsui Bussan branch in Calcutta, India, and 155 other Japanese residents have returned here. It is reported that India has become an unpleasant place for Japanese residents. The British authorities there have subjected Japanese residents to various oppressions. Restrictions on the export of Japanese goods to India are extremely strict, leading to a decline in trade. Attempts by Japanese residents to enlighten the Indian natives about Japan through movies and leaflets have been interfered with by British officials. Japanese residents are followed by police whenever they go out. (Reuters, 23rd)

### Japanese Representative Sawada's Visit to the Dutch East Indies Postponed

Due to the Christmas holidays, the trip has been slightly delayed and he will arrive on December 28th. (Reuters, 23rd)

### Japan Attempts to Conclude New Fishery Agreement with Soviet Union; Temporary Fishery Agreement About to Expire

Tokyo: It is reported that Japan is making special efforts to conclude a new fishery agreement with the Soviet Union before the expiration of the temporary Soviet-Japanese fishery agreement on December 31st to resolve this thorny issue once and for all. The Asahi Shimbun discussed the matter in detail, arguing that Japan should not simply renew the temporary agreement as a stopgap measure, stating that the long-unresolved fishing issue is undoubtedly one of the basic issues between the Soviet Union and Japan that Japan wants to resolve one by one. Japan has always regarded the fishing issue as a barometer of Soviet-Japanese diplomatic relations. In fact, this is not only an economic issue, but also an event with historical significance and tied to the emotions of the Japanese people. It is noted that this issue involves Japan's fishing rights in the waters around Sakhalin Island. (Reuters, 23rd)

### Soviet Union Protests Anti-Soviet Activities in Romania

### Chinese and Foreign Parties Refuse New Miscellaneous Currency; Black Market Exchange Rates Remain Stable; National Government Consistently Safeguards Trade with Allied Nations; Legal Tender Credit Strengthened, Reserves Adequate

Maintaining the stability of the legal tender exchange rate has been a long-established policy of the National Government, which has remained unchanged before and after the Incident. Since the establishment of the Exchange Equalization Fund Management Committee and the successive large loans to China from Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, the foreign exchange fund has become increasingly abundant, sufficient to stabilize the legal exchange rate and maintain the black market in Shanghai.

### Chinese and Foreign Parties Unanimously Reject New Miscellaneous Currency

The Ministry of Finance is reportedly strictly enforcing the prohibition of receiving and using miscellaneous currencies issued without approval. The Ministry of Finance has now unanimously rejected the new miscellaneous currency and will not engage in any relations with it in consultation with the Shanghai Allied Banks Chamber of Commerce, and has informed various industries of the actual situation of the issuance and reserve of the legal tender, which has been publicly announced on a regular basis, known to both Chinese and foreigners, its reserve is adequate, and its credit is obvious. Recently, it has repeatedly obtained assistance from allied countries to establish huge loans, and its credit has been further increased, making it extremely difficult to destroy. If miscellaneous currency is issued, all citizens should strictly abide by the creed in the National Covenant and unanimously refuse to receive and use it. As for the silver and money industry and commercial colleagues, they are all patriotic elements, and their interests are even more closely related. They should strictly adhere to their position, maintain a unified front, refuse to receive the currency, and have no dealings with it, in order to set an example and value finance. Any transactions or contracts established with the currency should be legally invalid, and all colleagues should strictly abide by and implement this. Those who deliberately violate this will be severely punished.

Yesterday's Black Market Situation

Yesterday, the financial market in Shanghai's black market experienced fluctuations again. The current Yu Yacha wildly soared to 6,615 yuan at closing, a sharp increase of 375 yuan compared to the 6,240 yuan at the end of last week. At the black market closing, the pound also tightened to 3 pence 375, and the US dollar also shrunk to 5 yuan 375. The pound tightened 32875 compared to the closing price at the end of last week, and the US dollar tightened 343175. The black market situation was extremely chaotic. According to an inquiry by a Pingming News Agency reporter to authoritative sources in the financial community, the sudden reaction in the black market yesterday was due to the fact that Japanese commercial banks once again violently climbed the black market exchange rate, and speculative merchants added fuel to the fire. In fact, China's financial situation is extremely solid, and the value of the legal tender itself has absolutely not been reduced in the slightest.

Maintaining Legitimate Trade with Allied Nations

The methods used by the Exchange Equalization Fund Management Committee to adjust the market price of foreign exchange are in accordance with the government's established policies and are measures approved by the government to make it meet the standards that are beneficial to our economy and maintain the balance of international payments. Although the black market exchange rate is different from the legal price, this phenomenon is not unique to China. However, the Exchange Equalization Fund Management Committee has repeatedly instructed banks to maintain it in order to reduce fluctuations in the Shanghai market. The reason why the government still maintains the Shanghai black market to this day is to take into account the international economic environment and the legitimate trade of various allied countries with China.

Legal Tender Credit is Becoming Stronger

In the past, fluctuations in the black market for foreign exchange caused general concern. In fact, almost all countries that control foreign exchange have black markets, and fluctuations in exchange rates during wartime are inevitable. For example, the fluctuations in foreign currencies after the outbreak of the European War were even greater than the fluctuations in the legal tender in the first year of the Incident. Since the government has made every effort to maintain the legal tender and stabilize the exchange rate, the confidence of Chinese and foreign people in the legal tender has increased even more, and they will not be affected by the fluctuations in the Shanghai black market. People in Shanghai and Hong Kong all believe that the Chinese legal tender is the most reliable.

Legal Exchange Rate Remains Unchanged

Today, the credit of China's legal tender still stands firm and unwavering. The legal exchange rate of the Central Bank remains the same as ever. As a result, the Chinese people, in view of the speed at which the currencies of the belligerent countries have fallen, have increased their faith in the legal tender. This is the most precious fact in the history of financial finance during the war of resistance. A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency yesterday paid a special visit to the person in charge of foreign exchange management at the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank. According to reports, China's legal exchange rate has always been the same, and the strength of the Exchange Equalization Fund Management Committee is also sufficient to stabilize the market. I sincerely hope that people from all walks of life will not easily believe rumors. As for those who legitimately need foreign exchange, they will be supplied by the bank as much as possible after being approved by the Foreign Exchange Examination Committee of the Ministry of Finance.

Effective Management of Adjusted Utilization

This time, the large loans to China from Britain and the United States have specified that a portion will be used to adjust the credit of the legal tender. Therefore, it is possible for the government to effectively manage the Shanghai market in the future. As for the government's effective management methods, since there is a real need for secrecy, it is currently impossible to speculate. However, the speculative elements lurking in the Shanghai market have been unable to use their skills due to the cooperation between the government and allied banks to maintain the Shanghai black market exchange rate. They have no choice but to find ways to create rumors in order to profit. As for the so-called opening of a certain bank, the Chinese government has already taken effective measures and will definitely not affect the Shanghai exchange market.

### All Sectors Strengthen Loyalty on Tomorrow's National Revival Festival; Uphold National Policies to Complete the Great Anti-Japanese and National Construction Undertaking; Continue to Promote the Movement to Save the Nation Through Thrift and Savings

Tomorrow is the National Revival Festival and the anniversary of the Yunnan Uprising. All sectors of the city will enthusiastically celebrate. All schools will also have a day off in accordance with the Ministry's prescribed school calendar. However, due to environmental reasons, no commemorative ceremony will be held. On December 12, 1936, the Xi'an Incident suddenly broke out, shocking both China and foreign countries. On Christmas night, December 25, the Supreme Leader safely arrived in Luoyang and returned to Nanjing the next day. The whole country was overjoyed beyond description. The situation at that time, and now thinking about it, is still vivid in our minds. At this time, when the military has reached the final stage of victory, all sectors will strengthen their belief in upholding the leader and completing national policies, and continue to promote the movement to save the nation through thrift, savings, and national construction, in order to fulfill their national responsibilities. The authorities in the two concessions have decided to implement a day of alert tomorrow in order to maintain security within the boundaries and prevent accidents.

### Smooth Water and Electricity Between Shanghai and Europe; Rumor That the Submarine Cable in the Mediterranean Has Been Cut Off by Italian Troops

According to a report from Manila on the 22nd, telecommunications in various parts of the Far East have been affected by the submarine cable laid through the Mediterranean Sea, which has been cut off by Italian troops. Six telecommunication lines in the Far East have been affected and cut off, causing telecommunication disruptions. According to inquiries made by reporters from Dagong News Agency to the receiving and sending offices of various submarine cable telegraph bureaus such as Datong and Daitung in the city yesterday, Shanghai has not suffered any impact. Currently, the submarine cable telegraphs between Shanghai and various parts of Europe are still maintained normally, unobstructed, and there are no obstacles. Moreover, due to the Christmas holiday, the receiving and sending are extremely crowded.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Awards Deserving Chinese Police; Zhang Aifa Died on Duty, Awarded First Class Medal

At noon on November 11th this year, a number of bandits armed with weapons broke into Yuanfengchang Rice Store at No. 7 Fuxu Road, stealing 2,800 yuan in cash and three checks. Afterwards, the store's coachman went out to report the crime. Many French Concession Chinese and Vietnamese police officers rushed to the scene upon hearing the alarm and chased the bandits. At that time, one of the bandits fled into Chongqing Road in the Public Concession. Chinese policeman No. 3349 Zhang Aifa was on duty at the intersection and helped chase him. When he chased to Dagu Road, he exchanged gunfire with the bandit. Unfortunately, he was shot in the lower abdomen by the bandit, but he still bravely moved forward and killed the bandit. He himself eventually died from his injuries.

Also, at around 9 p.m. on October 27, two Koreans armed with weapons broke into a hotel on the ground floor of No. 76 Jing'an Temple Road, robbing 500 yuan in cash. They fled into Lane 70 on the same road. At that time, a shop assistant from the store followed behind them. The bandits stepped out of the lane and took two rickshaws to escape to Guling Road. The shop assistant immediately reported to Chinese policeman No. 2768 Huang Runsen, who was on duty. The policeman immediately went forward to chase them and fired four shots. One of the bandits was injured and fell to the ground. The policeman continued to chase the other bandit until he reached the intersection of Baike Road, where he lost track of him. When he returned to the original location, the injured bandit had suddenly disappeared. Upon asking nearby residents, he learned that the bandit had taken a rickshaw along Baike Road to the east. The next day, the Xinzha police station received a report that a Korean man with injuries had sought treatment at Sanmin Hospital on North Henan Road and was soon transferred to Fumin Hospital. The police station sent detectives to bring him to the police station. After interrogation, he confessed that he was indeed the injured bandit yesterday.

At around 8:30 a.m. yesterday, three or four Japanese people, some working personnel, and investigators from the French Concession police station, totaling more than 20 people, rode in three Japanese trucks, numbered Ji Zi No. 30, No. 36, and No. 38, and a private car, license plate number 5156, to the front of No. 360 Pushe Road, Notre Dame Road, and got out of the car. They went to the front parlor downstairs in the building and threatened a Chinese man who came with them to hand over the key, but they failed. Then, the Japanese used an ax to chop open the door of the room and moved hundreds of bundles of sealed items in the parlor onto trucks. They continued to transfer to No. 54 Pushe Road and moved more than 300 sealed wooden boxes into the room. They moved them out one after another and loaded them onto the three trucks. The work was not finished until the evening. After witnessing the action, a reporter from Pingming News Agency learned from various sources that the documents in the wooden boxes were items deposited by the Municipal Finance Bureau after the Chinese army retreated to the west, and they may be books of land, property, and boat donations. The Chinese man who came with them seemed to be surnamed Wu, and his actions were restricted. Afterwards, he was still pushed into the private car by the Japanese and driven away.

### Japanese Authorities Intensify Road Construction; Rumor of Nomura's Assassination; One Assassin Has Been Captured

The Japanese authorities were still busy building a new road from Daxilu to Yuyuan Road yesterday (23rd). However, the road construction was slowed down by the light rain yesterday morning. At the same time, the Japanese authorities widened a certain lane on Taopeng Road to facilitate the construction of the new road. It is investigated that Lt. Nomura of the Japanese military medical corps was assassinated at the intersection of Taopeng Road and Huade Road last week. It was rumored that an assassin had been captured by the Japanese marines. The Japanese naval authorities remained silent about this. It was heard that the Japanese marines conducted a large-scale search in the Taopeng Road area and captured the assassin in a small village near Jining Road after more than 24 hours. At noon the day before yesterday (22nd), senior Japanese officials and major Japanese businessmen attended a ceremony at the Xibenyuan Temple on Zhapu Road to commemorate Nomura and the Japanese soldiers who died in Central China.

### Low Pressure System Has Passed, Shanghai's Climate Has Turned Cold

The weather in Shanghai has been abnormal recently due to the passage of a low-pressure system in the Yangtze River basin. Although it is early winter, when frost and snow should be severe and cold, the weather has been warm, like spring. The lowest temperature yesterday morning also reached 46.4 degrees. According to inquiries made by a reporter from Datong News Agency to the Xujiahui Observatory, the low-pressure system that swept through Shanghai has now crossed Shanghai and reached 36 degrees north latitude and 127 degrees east longitude, and continues to advance in a northeast direction. It is predicted that the weather near Shanghai will return to normal and the temperature will drop and gradually become cold, which will benefit agriculture and health.

### US Radio Interference Case Expected to Be Resolved: Japanese Consulate Says Reply This Week, But Interference Continued Yesterday

The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reports that the Japanese side continued to interfere today (the 23rd) with news broadcasts from the Shanghai-based American Hua Mei Radio Station (call sign XMHA). The Japanese authorities have yet to respond to the protest lodged by the US Consulate over this matter. According to a Japanese Consulate spokesperson, they expect the Japanese side to reply within the week, and the matter can be resolved amicably. However, the radio station's claim of interference being resolved does not necessarily mean that the fundamental "differences of opinion" will be eliminated. Regarding rumors circulating outside that Hua Mei Radio Station intends to disrupt Japanese radio stations in retaliation, an employee of Hua Mei Radio Station stated that the station has absolutely not retaliated, and the broadcasts yesterday (the 22nd) and this morning were still being interfered with. However, shortwave broadcasts have not been as severely affected.

### Southern Rice to Be Publicly Shipped to Shanghai: Reportedly Negotiated Successfully, Over 145,000 Stones Can Be Shipped Monthly Starting Next Year

According to well-informed sources, through the efforts of the authorities of the two concessions, a solution has been found for the source of national rice starting from the first of next month. It is reported that over 145,000 stones of Southern rice from the Songjiang and Jiading area can be shipped to Shanghai each month. It is generally believed that rice prices will inevitably trend downwards, and rice speculators can somewhat restrain themselves. "It has been investigated that rice from Wuhu and other regions can be shipped to Shanghai for sale at any time, but it is not publicly announced. If the above measures are implemented, rice transportation will be more convenient."

Yesterday Morning's Black Market Was Extremely Rampant

The trend of rising rice prices in the Shanghai market is intensifying, with rice speculators rampant, hoarding goods, and raising prices for profit. Yesterday, the market situation was unusually firm, and illegal transactions were very rampant. Brokers were still secretly acting as intermediaries, engaging in so-called "premium" buying and selling, attempting to create panic. The authorities dispatched detectives to monitor closely, but it was ineffective. Yesterday morning, the black market broke through the price limit by as much as three or four yuan. Rice also exceeded 80 yuan. The Shanghai Rice Evaluation Committee, given its responsibilities, cannot stand idly by. In order to discuss thorough measures, they have scheduled a temporary emergency meeting for 10:00 AM today at 15 Avenue Edward VII to discuss specific measures to stabilize the rice market. However, all sectors urgently hope that the committee can speak and act, and earnestly implement the resolutions without further delay.

Authorities Invite Discussions on Public Warehouse Grain Storage

The authorities of the two concessions, in order to actively promote public warehouse grain storage, have scheduled a meeting for 2:00 PM today at the Shanghai Municipal Council Building on Jiangxi Road to invite representatives from all sectors to discuss public warehouse grain storage methods. The eighth phase of subsidized rice sales was originally scheduled to begin on January 2nd. According to a person in charge of the subsidized rice sales committee, the various procedures for this phase of subsidized rice sales are actively underway. The required 20,000 bags of broken rice have already been shipped from Saigon on the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's "De Da" ship on the 7th of this month and are expected to arrive in Shanghai by the end of this month. The transaction price per bag is 80 yuan, so the determined subsidized rice sales cost will inevitably increase. Whether to sell each yuan for four *shi jin* is yet to be decided in a special meeting. However, because the deadline is approaching and all procedures have not been fully completed, the start will be postponed.

### Roland Fouled

Mr. Roland Fouled, a British Customs Commissioner of the Jianghai Customs, was previously rumored to be forced to retire within the year.

### Fang Jiahe and Others Sue the Consular Court Regarding Fang Dan Tax; Simultaneously Telegraph the Ministry of Justice Requesting Relief; Consular Body Schedules Hearing for January 8th

The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reports that four landlords of the Public Concession, including Fang Jiahe, refused to pay the Fang Dan land tax according to the law and were notified by the Shanghai Municipal Council that the Shanghai Telephone Company and the Shanghai Power Company would cease providing electricity and gas. Fang and others hired lawyers to sue the Consular Court and asked the Chinese Ratepayers' Association to telegraph the Ministry of Justice of the Chinese government requesting legal assistance. If the Shanghai Municipal Council wins the lawsuit, the council can collect huge sums of taxes amounting to millions of dollars from Fang Dan lands that have not paid land tax to date. It is reported that the Consular Court will hear this case on January 8th, with Mr. Lang, the secretary of the consular body, presiding. Mr. Lang stated this morning (the 23rd) that he did not know that the plaintiff in this case had submitted an application to the Ministry of Justice of the Chinese government, but the Consular Court will listen to this case in detail and arbitrate it and make a judgment.

### Foreigners Go Hunting at the Airfield: Hunting Rifles Confiscated by the Japanese; Claiming They Entered a Restricted Area; Guns Not Returned Even After Scheduled Pick-Up

It was learned yesterday that more than ten foreigners from various countries went hunting near the Hongqiao Aerodrome the other day (the 22nd). Japanese soldiers claimed that they were shooting within a restricted area and confiscated their hunting rifles, ammunition, and hunting licenses. According to the foreign hunters, they had obtained the necessary licenses beforehand, but the restrictions written in Chinese on the back of the licenses were vague and unclear, so they were unaware that they were entering a restricted area. It is reported that after a team of Japanese soldiers arrived at the scene and confiscated the hunting rifles, they asked the foreign hunters to go to the Japanese military unit at the aerodrome. After arriving at the unit, the Japanese side informed them that the hunting rifles would be returned yesterday (the 23rd) at the Japanese military headquarters on Lincoln Road. However, when several foreigners went to the headquarters on Lincoln Road yesterday morning, the Japanese lieutenant in charge said that the matter had to be handled by his superiors, so he did not know when the hunting rifles would be returned. According to a foreign hunter, the Japanese military seems to have a moderate view of the matter and understands that their border crossing was unintentional.

The three German merchant ships "Moufu," "Haifu," and "Feikang," were previously detained for sailing to Japanese naval blockade ports in eastern Zhejiang and were taken to Zhoushan Island for supervision for nearly three months. The German Consul in Shanghai negotiated with the Japanese side without success. Recently, the merchant ship department jointly sought help to mediate. After half a month of efforts, they were released last Friday. The three merchant ships then left Zhoushan Island one after another and returned to Shanghai. The "Feikang" was the first to arrive at the port at noon the day before yesterday (the 22nd) and docked at the Roosevelt Wharf.

### Daughter Voluntarily Promises Herself to Someone: Father Demands Excessive Bride Price; Asking Price Reaches 300,000, Negotiations Fail, Handed Over to the Police Station

The leather shoe workshop at No. 3 Jinyu Lane, South Chu Jiaqiao, Avenue Min Ti Ni Yin, in the French Concession, is owned by a local named Xu Hongsheng. In the past two years, due to the abnormal development of various industries, Xu's business has been quite prosperous and accumulated a large fortune. Xu has a biological daughter named Genmei, in her twenties, with a charming appearance.

She has not yet been betrothed. There is a young man in the same industry as Xu named Zhang Benxing, who is 19 years old. His father owns a leather shoe workshop on Jiu Cang Street in Nanshi, and his business is also quite prosperous. Zhang and Xu often visit Xu's place because of their industry relationship. Day after day, Zhang and Genmei developed a relationship. First, they went out to watch movies together, and then they fell in love. Both parties believed that they were adults and had the right to marry according to law. So on the afternoon of the 14th of this month, Xu Genmei called Zhang Benxing, and they agreed to meet in front of the Empire Theater at the intersection of Avenue Joffre and Avenue Petain. They went to Room 15 of the Rongfa Hotel in Bao Yu Lane, Avenue Edward VII, for a tryst. Unexpectedly, their plan was discovered by Xu Hongsheng, the girl's father, who rushed to the Rongfa Hotel with several friends and caught them in the act.

However, he did not send them to the police station to be investigated, but took them to Room 503 of the Yangtze Hotel on Yunnan Road in the Public Concession. The two sides negotiated the marriage issue. Xu said to Zhang, "Since you have taken a liking to my daughter, you must marry her formally and pay a bride price of 300,000 yuan, or I will send you to the authorities for investigation." Zhang was shocked to hear this, saying that he had no such huge amount of money, and that Xu's threats were all

Extortion. He refused to negotiate, and a deadlock was formed. Xu then called the police and had Zhang arrested and taken to the Lao Zha Police Station. After questioning by the police chief, it was discovered that the incident occurred in the French Concession, so the detective was dispatched to send the group to the French Police Station. The police chief ordered both parties to go out and reconcile, but because the amount of the bride price held by both sides was too different, it still could not be resolved satisfactorily. The police then investigated and dealt with it according to law. It is said that the daughter's heart has already

Sincerely inclined towards Zhang, blaming her father for insisting on obstructing her children's marriage and demanding excessive prices. It is unknown how this case will be resolved in the future and whether it can achieve a satisfactory result, allowing the lovers to finally be together. It is still difficult to predict.

### Finance Mad Buying, Foreign Exchange Unleashes a Major Storm

Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: The exchange rate quotation. At 11:15 AM, the second announcement showed another sharp contraction. The British gold exchange rate changed to three pence three seven five, the US dollar exchange rate was five yuan three one two five, and other exchange rates such as Dutch, Russian, and Japanese currencies also changed uniformly. As for the domestic market situation, it was extremely chaotic. The market opened tight due to rumors from last weekend afternoon. Under the collusion of speculators and foreign firms, it became tight and soft again. People's hearts were slightly stabilized because the HSBC quotation did not change for the first announcement. However, soon speculators became like crazy people digging frantically. Although foreign firms such as HSBC and Mercantile supplied up to two million yuan of US dollars, it was ultimately insufficient, like too few monks for too little porridge. The tightest US dollar exchange rate reached five yuan four zero six two five. The US dollar was slightly sold at noon, causing it to stabilize. The post-market opened with little change. However, due to the continued strong demand from speculators, the tight trend was extraordinarily strong. Although foreign firms such as HSBC maintained it, it was ineffective. By the evening, the British gold exchange rate had reached three pence four zero six two five, and the US dollar exchange rate was five yuan three four three seven five, a sharp contraction of one eight seven five and three seven five compared to last Saturday's closing for British and US currencies. Futures were all tight.

HSBC Quotation Contracts Again

In the early morning, the exchange rates between British and US Shanghai dollars were flat, while the exchange rates between US and British Shanghai dollars did not change. The central quotation for various currencies remained the same. The bank's opening spot selling prices were three pence five three one two five for British gold and five yuan five nine three seven five for US dollars, which was tight by zero six two five for British and soft by one two five for US compared to last Saturday's noon closing. This was due to the rumors last Saturday afternoon that foreign banks would stop supplying foreign exchange, so the underlying trend had already shown a strange contraction that day. After the opening, foreign firms settled accounts, and foreign banks were willing to supply, so the market did not change. Foreign firms offered US dollars for next month at five yuan five nine three seven five. Later, Chinese merchants also dug into foreign firms to settle the same month's US dollars, going into foreign firms at five yuan five six two five. At this time, people's hearts were uneasy. When the HSBC quotation was announced and the exchange rates did not move, the market situation began to stabilize slightly. The spot US dollar once rebounded to five yuan six two five, but soon a tight wind suddenly arose, and speculators were buying. Initially, foreign banks sold next month's contracts at five yuan five, and then opened the same month's first order, announcing three pence five one five six two five. Later, because the supply from foreign banks could not meet the demand, speculators had already eaten up next month's US dollars to five yuan four zero six two five. At 11:10, the HSBC quotation announced another contraction, with both British and US exchange rates tightening by one two five and two five respectively, resulting in three pence three seven five for British currency and five yuan one two five for US currency. Other currencies were all soft. Until 11:30, it was heard that American banks were selling slightly, which once showed a hardening. Foreign firms absorbed US dollars for this month into American banks at five yuan plus change. However, at noon, speculators were still digging frantically. US dollars for January entered foreign firms at five yuan four three seven five. The closing spot price was two pence four six eight seven five for British gold and five yuan four three seven five for US dollars, a contraction of zero six two five and one five six two five compared to the morning opening for British and US currencies respectively.

Buying Wind Continues Unabated

The initial situation in the post-market was still moderate. However, before long, foreign firms and speculators flocked to settle next month's US dollars. Foreign firms gave up to five yuan three four three seven five. Later, HSBC and Mercantile maintained selling, so it eased slightly, and speculators spat out next month's US dollars at five yuan three seven five. However, before the closing, speculators stirred up a buying wind again, and the market was still brisk. Chinese firms settled this month's US dollars with speculators at five yuan three seven five, and next month's at five yuan three four three seven five. Moreover, the closing result showed that the price contracted even more. The spot and this month's US dollars were five yuan three four three seven five, the first order was three pence four zero six two five, and next month's US dollars were five yuan three one two five, the first order was three pence seven five, which was a tightening of one eight seven five for both spot and futures British gold and a contraction of one two seven five for US dollars compared to last week's noon closing.

### Under the Manipulation of Bulls, the Gold Market Rises with Alarming Wind, Reaching a Peak of 6680 Yuan, the Price Has Surpassed the US Dollar

Yesterday, the spot gold price in the black market rose sharply by more than 500 yuan, reaching a peak of 6680 yuan, which was truly shocking. Speculative frenzy restarted, and some people even looked forward to rising to more than 7000 yuan. As for the reasons for the rise, it was purely due to people's hearts being influenced by the air spread by the bulls. It is said that the bulls in the Shanghai West Gang have sufficient strength and have a manipulative tendency, so today, general short positions painfully cut their losses. Also, the large purchases of the securities gang were the main driving force behind the jump in market prices. After the morning opening, it once dropped by 50 yuan, but after the securities gang stirred up a buying wind, it flew to 6610 yuan. The gang continued to buy in the post-market, eventually pushing it up to 6680 yuan, which was one of the most prosperous scenes of rising winds since the opening of futures trading. The strange tightness of the exchange market was caused by the rise in gold prices. When gold prices were settled according to the US dollar exchange rate, yesterday it was found to be higher by about 100 yuan. In the past, it was often lowered by more than 200 yuan. The closing result was 6615 yuan, an increase of 515 yuan compared to last Saturday's closing. The total daily transaction volume was about 15,000 taels. The spot price and the futures price have been flattened out, with only a difference of 5 to 10 yuan. For example, silver firms once mutually traded 50 taels in the morning, and swaps were not opened. Jewelry gold rose by 35 yuan, reaching 675 yuan. Customs gold and other items were all flat.

Spot Gold Was Lifted by More Than 500 Yuan

In the early morning, after last week's market close, the outside market had already flown to 6300 yuan, so the opening price rose sharply by 150 yuan. The securities gang entered the gold firm at 20 yuan, announcing 5250 yuan. After the opening, floating longs took profits at high prices, so it was slightly suppressed. It is estimated that the gold firm sold 30 taels to the silver firm, at 6200 yuan. But after this, the market was agitated by various unfounded rumors, and a fierce buying wind rose suddenly. The securities gang bought heavily, jumping across the board in an instant, reaching a maximum of 6610 yuan. It is estimated that the silver firm did 20 taels against each other. Later, because the exchange bill dealer sold slightly, it was lowered by 200 yuan. It is estimated that the silver firm sold 20 taels to the gold firm, announcing 6420 yuan. But near noon, it was heard that foreign exchange was contracting, and the buying wind on the table was revived, and the price rose again. It is estimated that the money exchange industry entered the silver firm at 20 yuan, announcing 6550 yuan. In the afternoon, those who took profits sold slightly, announcing 6500 yuan. It is estimated that the gold and silver firms did 30 taels against each other. In the afternoon, the floor organized accounts and added margin. The market opened at 3 o'clock, which was stable at first. The silver firm sold for 6505 yuan. Later, the gold and silver firms jointly searched and lifted it to 6600 yuan again. Later, it once revolved between 65780 yuan, but the foreign exchange reported contraction, and the securities gang came to buy in succession, reaching the pinnacle, advancing to 6680 yuan. It was heard that there were still many new longs buying at that time, and floating shorts cutting losses. The closing price in the evening was 6615 yuan, resulting in a sharp increase of 515 yuan compared to last Saturday's closing. The daily fluctuations were huge, with 480 yuan. The selling price of the spot gold firm's original brand was more than 10 yuan higher than the spot gold, and the receiving price was 30 yuan lower. The current bid gold price was 560 yuan lower than the listed gold price, and there were few openings.

Silver Gold Was 675 Yuan

The exchange price of jewelry gold per tael in silver buildings rose by 10 yuan at 10:11, continued to rise by 10 yuan at 11:00, increased by another 5 yuan at 3:00 PM, and added 10 yuan at 4:00 PM. As a result, Datonghang listed 675 yuan, and Xintonghang was similar to the above price. The closing price was reduced by about 30 yuan.

Foreign Currencies Also Rose

Yesterday's foreign currency market situation was that due to the continued prosperity of rumors of good news, the spot gold price rose greatly, and British and American gold pounds also rose by 8 yuan each. The British gold ticket still had little trading, and the market price still stood on the original plate. The American gold ticket initially fell to 17 yuan 9 jiao, and once rose to 19 yuan 2 jiao in the afternoon, and finally ended at 18 yuan 8 jiao and a half, a sharp increase of 6 jiao compared to last Saturday. The demand for Hong Kong tickets was strong, and the market price rose to 4 yuan 3 jiao. In addition, tickets such as Singapore, Annam, Canada, and the Philippines all tended to rise. The demand for Japanese gold tickets was eager, and the evening market rose to 1 yuan 6 jiao 2 fen. The Korean ticket trended slightly upward, and the evening market rose to 1 yuan 3 jiao 3 fen.

### Yarn and Cotton, Cotton Yarn Soars, Double Horse Exceeds the 400 Yuan Mark, Jumping Across by a Huge 60 to 70 Yuan

The yarn market rose sharply, and the trend was extraordinarily sharp. This was because the foreign exchange contracted sharply and gold soared, which led to excitement. Foreign customers have long been absorbing large quantities in the market. However, most industry peers are thinking poorly, and most have turned from long to short, so the pressure is heavy, and the more they want to rise, the more tired they become. How can they expect to be subject to environmental control today? The so-called insiders have no way to support it. In the morning, it was reported that there were labor strikes in the Xinyu and Xinsheng factories, and buyers flocked in. At the same time, the Hong Kong gang currency required to be more active, so the market rose sharply. In the afternoon, it rose outside the 400 yuan mark.

The opening of Shuangma and Nongma was mediocre, not as frantic as the afternoon of the weekend. Because most of the peers are looking tired, there are still many sellers. The first plate of 20-count Shuangma was priced at 1,350 yuan, down 15 yuan from the previous day's black market. After this plate opened, foreign customers still entered, rising to 1,364 yuan. Due to the contraction of the foreign exchange by two gears, people's hearts were still flat, and sellers were still seen to be enthusiastic. It also fell back to 1,3523 yuan, but the bulls still came to drag in, rising to 1,362 yuan again. However, a certain speculator in the industry spat out the amount received the previous day, and the market price suddenly loosened to 1,346 yuan. Unexpectedly, as 11 o'clock approached, the foreign exchange stepped down and gold soared, and the market changed abruptly. The market price directly soared to 1,387 yuan. Those who took profits sold another ten yuan less, but at the close, it was heard that the exchange bill was still soft, and it rose to 1,393 yuan. It was found that the transaction volume in half a day was 8,610 bales. The market price of 20-count Shuangma rose by 50 yuan. The amount purchased by each gang is listed on the left.

Hong Kong 104 firms 8,000 Total 8,610

In the afternoon, the yarn market continued to soar, people's hearts were chaotic, and those who bought and sold were very lively. The price of 20-count Shuangma started to be 1,405 yuan, followed by 1,000 and 10 yuan. The price of 20-count Shepherd was 1,360 yuan, and new peaks emerged one after another.

The Xinyu Factory and Xinsheng Yarn Factory in this city had a strike this morning because they demanded improved treatment. After a mediation, both labor and management reached an understanding. Wages have been increased by 30% according to the original, and work has resumed normally in the afternoon.

Raw Cotton Follows Up

The cotton market is expensive. Because the foreign exchange has contracted sharply and the yarn market is soaring, the raw cotton, which is dependent on each other, tends to rise following up. In the morning, the shouting price rose by 10 yuan, and there were few transactions, rising by 6 to 7 yuan. In the afternoon, the yarn market continued to rise, people's hearts were chaotic, and they were still moving forward.

Another message: In the foreign cotton market, the New York cotton market was more active. Because the spot transaction improved, the closing price was 3 to 4 pounds higher than the previous day. The Indian market situation was mediocre.

In Shanghai and other ports, due to the sharp contraction of the exchange rate yesterday, all parties turned to a hopeful attitude. In fact, the factory's buying intention was strong, and the peers were unwilling to sell. According to the current situation, the cotton price will rise.

### Grain, Speculators' Tricks Are Becoming More and More Strange, Foreign Rice Strictly Implements Black Market Discounts, All That Is Seen on the Market Are Mixed Grades Still Sold at Top Prices, and Observation of the Source Still Reveals That It Is Endless and Does Not Benefit People's Food

Since the foreign rice market became more and more firm the week before, the market opened for the first time after the holiday yesterday, and people's hearts were still high. Later, it was heard again that gold prices had soared, and the situation became even more chaotic. Those who held goods, whether Saigon No. 1 or 2, small batches, etc., did not release them. Under such rejection, the market suddenly became a dead image. The Saigon, Siam, and No. 2 fire small batch, etc., which were subject to price limits, slightly lived their discount black market lives. Therefore, the price-limited rice in the market has become silent and there is no transaction. In fact, the black market life is more active than the formal market. It is said that most of the price discounts are 2 to 3 yuan per city stone, and it is common to discount 5 to 600 yuan per hundred bags. However, they are directly contacted and are very secret, only with the feeling that if something goes wrong, there is no evidence to investigate. However, mixed-color secondary rice has also increased by 2 to 3 yuan. For example, the rice category of Milu opened at 78 to 9 yuan last Saturday, and yesterday it opened at 80 yuan, 81 yuan, 81 and a half yuan, to 82 yuan. The milled Xian increased from 80 yuan 5 jiao to 81 yuan 2 jiao. The Wu Xian increased from 80 yuan to 81 yuan 5 jiao. The term rice, which is not subject to price limits, is even more focused on by speculators. No. 2 Saigon, January lower at 94 yuan, January at 91 yuan 8 jiao, December at 97 yuan, 98 to 9 yuan, small batch December at 93 yuan 5 jiao, January at 84 yuan 2 jiao, and January lower February upper at 86 yuan, with both entry and exit being prosperous and transactions exceeding one thousand tons. There are more than 10,000 bags of spot rice. The lives of the citizens have now reached a state of absolute crisis. If the rice market is watched and not corrected, the public order will also be affected in the future. It is to protect the interests of a few hoarders while disregarding the livelihood of most citizens, and there is no standard to speak of, which is a pity. Zhongguan Huowen was 86 yuan, Tokyo Milled Tip was 81 yuan and a half, Red Coarse was 75 yuan, 74 yuan and a half, Wuhu Tip was 81 yuan, and Milu was 80 yuan, Broken Rice was 767 yuan, and the second was 72 yuan.

The rice market is like this, but when you look at the source of foreign rice, it is still extremely crowded. Yesterday, a large batch arrived at the port again. Yihong Foreign Firm's Yusheng wheel transported 1,600 bags from Hong Kong, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning, and docked at the Roosevelt Wharf for unloading. Taikoo Company's Taiyuan wheel also arrived in port yesterday afternoon and was also loaded with 11,420 bags from Hong Kong, docking at the company's wharf on the Bund of the French Concession for unloading. Yesterday, a total of 13,020 bags arrived. It is heard that there is still a large batch on the way to Shanghai. Foreign rice only cares about coming, all are closed by hoarders, and it is still not helpful to people's food. (Ancestor)

Thick and thin Japonica and other domestic rice, at this time, are also competing with each other, all prospering. It is estimated that Kunshan Hu粳 is 101 yuan to 99 yuan, and Qingjiao thin rice is seen at 91 yuan, 90 yuan, and the original package is 96 yuan, which is 1 to 2 yuan higher than the week before.

Because glutinous rice is an auxiliary product, the road is not wide, and most large households have quite a lot of inventory, seeing that the glutinous rice market has no hope, they are constantly releasing it, so it is uniquely plain and unremarkable, and it showed a soft color in the early market. It was not until near noon that it was rumored that foreign rice had an over-limit plate, and people's hearts were just right, and there was a lot of pulling in, so the shouting price rose, and as a result, the selling price rose by half a yuan to nearly one yuan. The opening price for Yili Baiyuan was 96 yuan and a half, 96 yuan, and the Hong Kong hundred yuan was 84 yuan 7 jiao, to 82 yuan 5 jiao, Glutinous tea was 73 yuan, and the second was 68 yuan.

### Flour Speculation, Doing Old Tricks

The flour market rose sharply. Since the tension last week, although a huge amount has arrived at the port, the market is still difficult to suppress. Yesterday was the beginning of the week, and suddenly due to the sharp contraction of foreign exchange, the high price of goods, and many rumors, people's hearts were panic-stricken, and speculators were doing old tricks. The newly arrived Australian flour flyer has become a bargaining chip for the market supply. It is heard that the price of Huaniao and Zhonglou brands should be 21 yuan 8 jiao and a half, and the post-market has added another angle. The Meili brand has also risen from 21 yuan 67 jiao to the 22 yuan mark. The Yezhu brand Qingzha rose by 23 jiao. The total market transaction reached more than 30,000 bags. In the midst of cracking down on speculation in the rice market, general hot money is also making trouble in the flour market. It is also heard that due to the shortage of raw materials, the Huachang flour factory will stop supplying, but there is probably no problem within the year, and there may be new methods for implementing cheap flour from January next year. There is a shortage of both supply and demand for wheat, and the market price has been shouted up to 33 yuan, but there are no solid new transactions.

### Securities, Domestic Debt Bulls Unleashed

The black market for public debt, yesterday the market was agitated by rumors, and for a time, everyone was frightened by their own shadows, Jinzi was rising, foreign exchange was suddenly tight, and many parties in the public debt flocked to the market, and the market price began to crack. Yesterday, in the morning, the market was flat and tired, and Hengfu Datong Tongshun and Xinhua sold, and Runli Tongsheng Dachang Kang bought in, and the market price was slightly tired by 12 jiao to 4 and a half jiao. In the afternoon, Hengfu Tongshun continued to sell, and Yizhong Shenchang Huhuji Lianyi all sold, but Shunchang bought in, and Changji Runli Maoda all bought in slightly, but the supply and demand gap was huge, and there was a sharp drop into the three yuan mark, and people's hearts were weaker. As a result, they all fell back by 67 jiao. There was no opening for Category D, and there was no market for 96 in the afternoon, and the total transaction volume was a total of 223 million yuan. A brief table is listed below.

Stock trading: 100 shares of the Bank of China were transacted at a price of 89 yuan.

The American Shanghai Telephone Company has set January 15 for the opening of ordinary and special tax surplus mixed dividends for 1940, 7 jiao 5 fen per share.

The British Public Automobile Company, under the guise of increased raw material prices, has increased prices by 35%, and the burden on citizens has increased accordingly. It is found that the company's business has been very developed after the war, and its profits have been very large. It is said that before the price increase, the daily net profit was 20,000 yuan, and it doubled on Sundays. Since the price increase, the daily net profit has been 40,000 yuan, and it doubles on Sundays. Under such business conditions, there is no need to increase prices. Therefore, the general public still hopes that the company will consider the interests of passengers and be able to reduce ticket prices as soon as possible to reduce the burden on citizens.

Also, the stock market of the Public Works Bureau has risen again due to the tight foreign exchange. Although there are many sellers at high prices, the buyers are very happy to accept them, and the closing trend is still firm. The price of the rubber stock Tengda has also increased dramatically, and the transaction is extremely large.

### Miscellaneous Grains, Oil Bean Prices Are Also Soaring

Yesterday, the oil bean cake and miscellaneous grain market was also affected by the environment, and people's hearts were restless. In the early morning, the general market situation was invisibly firm, but the trend had not yet shown any tightness. At the noon closing, news came that it was beneficial to hoarding goods, which caused all market prices to rise. In the afternoon, there was a complete dramatic change, and there was actually a market without goods. Transactions were only for profit-taking businesses, and market prices were soaring madly, with no end in sight. As a result, the price of raw soybean oil was 3 yuan higher than last Saturday, and 500 barrels, 300 dan, and 50 pieces of futures and spot soybean oil were transacted by hoarders from this street, etc., and 500 cans, 70 barrels, and 350 pieces of raw oil were transacted. Yellow beans rose by more than 1 yuan, and more than 4,000 bags of various beans were transacted, and they were divided by the Hong Kong gang, Xiamen gang, local hoarders, etc.

Also, 1,070 bags of beans arrived from Tianjin yesterday.

### Piece Goods, Cotton Cloth Is Expensive

Yesterday, the fabric market opened flat and tired, and both buyers and sellers adopted a wait-and-see attitude, and there were few transactions. However, when the foreign exchange reported a contraction, the buying momentum suddenly increased, and the selling price was raised step by step. The transaction volume of factories and peers also increased several times. The Fugui fine cloth was sold for 37 yuan and 5 jiao in the morning, and in the post-market, it increased from 38 yuan and 5 jiao to 39 yuan and 2 jiao and a half, and there were all transactions. As a result, the price of fine cloth of each brand rose by 1 yuan to 1 yuan 7 jiao and a half, the fine twill was about 1 yuan, and the coarse cloth rose by 5 jiao to 1 yuan. The price of bleached and dyed cloth and gray cloth also rose by 1 yuan. This street transacted more than 5,000 pieces of spot goods and next month's futures, and the Guangdong and Hong Kong gangs transacted more than 500 pieces of colored cloth, coarse and fine cloth, and bleached cloth, etc., and the Zhejiang Road, Wenzhou, and Yongbo gangs transacted more than 300 pieces of Yihe, Shenxin, and Yong'an cloth, etc., and the North Road, Yantai, and Qingdao gangs transacted more than 200 pieces of coarse cloth, etc.

Dongbu first flattened and then rose, and the rise was very violent. When the market opened in the morning, the yarn price was mediocre, and the leading fine cloth hovered around 40 yuan. Afterwards, because gold was rising and people's hearts were agitated, internal and external hoarders searched for it. By the noon closing, it was 41 yuan and 5 jiao. The post-market continued to rise to 42 yuan and 9 jiao. The closing price was 3 yuan higher than the dark market last week, and the fine twill only rose by 1 yuan 56 jiao. The high plate of the Four Gentlemen Serge had been sold for 1 yuan 2 jiao 6 fen, and the closing price was 1 yuan 2 jiao 5 fen 75.

100 pieces of export cotton cloth will be shipped to Yantai today.

### Silk and Tea Pessimistic Outlook for the Silk Market

The local silk market has been impacted by the fluctuations driven by the "Jiangning Central Bank." Silk prices have risen sharply due to the drastic depreciation of foreign exchange. White filature silk 7/8, 20/22, has been sold for 4,900 yuan, nearly 200 yuan higher than ten days ago. Ren Ji and other firms have been actively buying. Tussah silk of the highest quality is selling for 4,050 yuan. Currently, silk merchants holding goods are uniformly bullish, believing that Shanghai's environment is increasingly precarious and that the economic backlash will worsen from 1941 onwards. Therefore, the outlook for silk prices is unanimously optimistic.

### Impoverished Lives of Teachers at All Levels in This City, All Related Parties Are Seeking Relief

(Da Hua News Agency) Recently, prices in this city have soared, and the livelihoods of teachers have become increasingly difficult. They are planning ways to seek relief. Yesterday, a reporter from Da Hua News Agency met with responsible personnel from related parties to inquire about their opinions. According to them, the impoverished lives of teachers are almost unsustainable. The problem is extremely serious, and they are deeply concerned. They are currently seeking relief from various aspects. The main points are as follows:

School Finances Should Be Made Public

The fact that private schools in this city fail to fully disclose their financial income and expenditure cannot be denied. As a result, the relationship between teachers and principals has almost become one of employer and employee. This is indeed an undesirable phenomenon in education. In the future, school finances should be fully disclosed so that teachers can understand the school's financial situation. At the same time, the principle that school funds must be used for the school must be established. Economize on other expenses, increase teacher salaries. On the one hand, it can reduce the estrangement between teachers and principals, and on the other hand, it can make economic expenditure more reasonable and make school affairs easier to promote.

Budget Allocation, Predefined Standards

The so-called rationalization of school budget allocation means, at this time, we must first consider the salary standards related to the livelihoods of teachers and students. I believe that in addition to employee salaries, everything else in the school should be economized under the principle of not reducing educational effectiveness. Of all school income, including tuition and miscellaneous fees, subsidies, sponsorships, etc., except for rent, it is best to allocate 70% to teacher salaries and 30% to office expenses and equipment fees. I hope that the school authorities will consider and implement it.

Increase Tuition Appropriately to Provide Support

Currently, the cost of living index will exceed six times that of pre-war levels, but even if tuition and miscellaneous fees have been increased, they are not six times higher. At this time, student families and the general public should understand the impoverished lives of teachers and temporarily endure the pain of accepting the teachers' call to appropriately increase the burden of educational expenses. Therefore, for the collection of miscellaneous fees for the next semester, the past fee amount and actual economic situation can be reviewed, and the original amount can be increased by 20% to 50%. However, for poor students, consideration should still be given to appropriately reduce or waive fees. In this way, after increasing tuition and miscellaneous fees, the studies of impoverished students will not be affected. It is also hoped that enthusiastic members of society will organize more scholarships, loans, and other charitable activities.

Request the Central Government to Plan Overall Relief

After the implementation of the above measures, the treatment of teachers in the next semester will naturally be improved, but the entire livelihood problem cannot be solved. Therefore, it is necessary to request the central government to consider the hard work and achievements of Shanghai's educators, allocate large sums of money specifically for teacher livelihood relief expenses. This matter is currently being planned and carried out by responsible parties from all sides. It is deeply believed that the central government is deeply concerned about Shanghai's educators and will be able to meet the expectations of the public.

Social Figures Working Together

Education is the foundation of a nation and has a close relationship with local culture. Anyone has the funds to support and promote education. Teachers are cultural warriors, and society should do its best to support these warriors who are struggling. Therefore, in addition to schools raising funds themselves and the government providing rapid relief, social groups and people from all walks of life should bear a portion of the responsibility for solving this problem. Financial institutions, municipal chambers of commerce, major industries, and powerful groups in this city should consider the overall situation and raise educational funds to work with the central government to deal with the current problems in this city. This is not only the good fortune of the region, but also the benefit of the nation's future.

Dawn Concert Broadcast on Christmas Eve

The Dawn Concert, organized by more than a dozen male and female students from well-known schools in this city, is a purely musical extracurricular group. During the summer vacation of this year, with the help of the Lu brothers, Lu Jiajun and Lu Jiahua, who are good at swimming on the mainland, XQHB Radio broadcast popular Western songs once a week. At that time, it was unanimously praised by all walks of life, and Western expatriates in this city especially praised it. Soon, schools started one after another, and the broadcast stopped immediately. Now, taking advantage of the Christmas holiday, they will broadcast again on the eve of Christmas (December 24) at 4:00 PM, sitting at XQHB Radio, wave 820, to thank everyone for their love. I hope music lovers in Shanghai will tune in in time and not miss this good opportunity.

### Last Night's YMCA Basketball, China Star Defeated Macklin Red Team, Shanghai Star's Performance Was Unexpectedly Wonderful, Macklin Officers' Victory Was Hard-Won

In last night's YMCA basketball game, China Star won its second victory, defeating the Macklin Red Team by a score of 46 to 29. The first half ended with a score of 30 to 16. The Macklin Red Team resisted tenaciously, but ultimately lost to China Star's sharp offense. China Star changed to a five-man zone defense last night, which is a noteworthy point. In the second game, Shanghai Star's battle with the Macklin Officers was unexpectedly wonderful. As a result of the fierce battle, the Macklin Officers only won by 56 to 44, a difference of 12 points. Shanghai Star's wonderful performance made the Officers' victory very difficult. The score difference between the two teams was only between four and five points each time. Shanghai Star even twice chased to a difference of only two points. It can be said that although they lost, they were still glorious. Liang Yunming scored 20 points alone, and his shooting was superb. In the last game, Liangxi lost to Giant by 25 to 34. The first half ended with a score of 15 to 19. Liangxi's performance yesterday was poor and very chaotic. In the second half, Liangxi once tried to chase to a tie of 25, but was then scored nine points by Giant.

### The Sadness of Santa Claus

— by Lau Ka Kam

The cold wind has stripped the roadside branches bare, and the fields have become even more withered and yellow: it is when a calendar is about to toll its death knell that the doddering Santa Claus hobbles down to earth once again. He suddenly smells a thicker than usual whiff of sulfur. The old man cannot help but frown, shift his 'bag of happiness' on his back, and sigh, 'Another year! Everything has changed!'

The old man walked into a city. There were not as many people welcoming him as before, and the enthusiastic atmosphere seemed to have diminished somewhat. However, the old man ignored this and continued to distribute his annual gifts as usual. When he reached a young woman, her miserable expression aroused the old man's curiosity. He stepped forward, stroked the woman's hair, and said, 'Tell me, my child! Why are you so worried? Haven't I brought you the happiness you need?' 'No, you haven't brought back my husband who died on the battlefield,' the young woman said coldly. The old man's joyful face also turned sad. Yes, the old man's 'bag of happiness' did not bring back the young woman's husband. The old man gently kissed the grieving young woman's temples and walked away helplessly.

'Little one, what makes you unhappy?' The old man met the second person who was sad, a child of about ten years old, and asked him.

'My mother is gone. She was crushed to death when a wall collapsed. From now on, I can no longer enjoy her kind caresses.'

'Ah!' The old man couldn't help but sigh in annoyance. He kissed the child in the same way and shook his head as he left this irritating corner.

Walking on and on, the old man arrived in a magnificent Eastern city. The neat and smooth streets and the towering skyscrapers made the old man's heart flutter. Surely the people here must be happy. They will surely be happy to receive the happiness I have brought them.

However, unfortunately, the old man still found people filled with sorrow. The old man said to a middle-aged man in a kind tone: 'Respected sir! Are you still not satisfied with the happiness I have given you? Tell me, what do you lack? I will satisfy you!' 'No, you absolutely cannot!' the middle-aged man said loudly. 'You bring happiness every year, but this happiness is snatched away by the rich. Now, the high cost of living is draining our blood, ruining our health, and drying up all our sources of joy! Merciful old man! We long for the day we can hold our heads high, but who knows when that day will come.' The old man was clearly disappointed again, but he said with certainty: 'No, respected sir! You must have a firm belief that the final day of happiness will always come!'

Filled with annoyance and sorrow, the old man embarked on his return journey, the wrinkles on his forehead appearing even deeper. The old man stroked the still full 'bag of happiness' (which would normally be empty!), and couldn't help but murmur sadly: 'Another year has passed! Everything has changed!'

Qian Muzhai was just drinking a mouthful of tea when Liu Rushi said this, and he couldn't help but laugh, spraying tea all over himself. Liu Rushi quickly took a clean handkerchief to wipe him off. Qian Muzhai then said, "This is a joke that someone deliberately created, like a teacher who teaches the wrong characters." Liu Rushi said, "I'm afraid not. In my opinion, this is a satire of officials in the imperial court. There are quite a few such people among today's scholar-officials. That's why I dare to ask you, sir, if you want to be a female dog. Don't you take offense at my words?" Qian Muzhai shook his head and said, "Why would I want to be a female dog? I uphold the words of the sages, to give one's life in times of danger and to think of righteousness when one sees it." Liu Rushi nodded and said, "In that case, if the country were to fall, you would be prepared to die for it." Qian Muzhai said, "Of course, if the worst happens, I will give up this old life. Wen Wen Shan is my good example. There are things worse than death, so I will not seek to avoid it by any means. Liu Xiang, Liu Qing, I won't be able to take care of you then." After saying this, he placed the teacup heavily on the table and sighed again. Liu Rushi took Qian Muzhai's hand in her slender hand and said, "If you can do this, sir, I would be fortunate. At that time, I will also die to follow you to the afterlife. The Five Emperors were sages and died, the Three Kings were benevolent and died, Shi Yu was brave and died, who in this world has not died? But death can be heavier than Mount Tai or lighter than a feather, it all depends on our own choice. How can one bear a reputation that stinks for ten thousand years when one could have a reputation that lasts for generations? How can one compare dying old under a window with drunkenly lying on a sandy battlefield? It would also not be a disgrace to the two hundred years of grace that the Ming Dynasty has bestowed upon scholars." After hearing these words from Liu Rushi, Qian Muzhai looked at her beautiful face closely. He saw a stern frost covering her face, as if she could not be violated, and he could not help but admire her secretly. He then said, "That you can encourage me like this is Qianyi's good fortune. When disaster strikes, I will surely die for the country. It is just that I cannot bear to see your flower-like appearance, jade-like quality, and exquisitely carved heart and liver perish with me." Liu Rushi said, "I have already decided, why should you regret it on my behalf? So-called seeking benevolence and obtaining benevolence, what is there to complain about? Only in a strong wind does one know the strength of the grass, only in turbulent times does one recognize loyal ministers. When that time comes, it will truly be a great touchstone, and the distinction between loyalty and treachery, virtue and wickedness, man and beast, will be made at this critical juncture. People like Hong Chengchou and Wu Sangui, who betray the country for glory and engage in perverse acts, I am afraid that the generals and officials of Jiangnan will inevitably be demoralized and humiliated, and become accomplices of tigers. Recently, I have quietly observed that your ambition has declined a lot, so today, taking advantage of your return, I am reminding you not to waver in your resolve, lest you regret it too late. Now that you have a lofty and unyielding ambition, when the times are dire, true integrity will be revealed, leaving a righteous spirit for eternity, and future generations will praise Liu Rushi's discerning eyes for still being able to recognize people, and though she dies, she will still be honored. This is my great fortune." Qian Muzhai held her soft hand and said, "Don't worry, I will never let you down." "These few days I have been feeling very depressed, and I want to drink a few cups with you to dispel my melancholy." Liu Rushi then smiled and said, "I have wine stored for a long time. Today I heard your words, sir, and they were exciting and moving. I am very happy in my heart, and I will accompany you to drink a few cups. Once the barbarian cavalry goes south and the land changes color, I am afraid that the desire for joy will be unattainable." She then instructed the maids to cook some dishes, and she herself took a bottle of rose wine from the food cabinet, filled two small porcelain cups, sat facing Muzhai, and raised a glass to urge him to drink. Muzhai felt a little strange in his heart, as if he did not know what to do, and only drank the wine, getting drunk and losing all sense of himself. Liu Rushi helped him to sleep. The beautiful moonlight shone into the room from the gauze window, illuminating the beautiful scene in the boudoir. The Luo tent was lowered, the mandarin duck quilt was lightly covered, the bronze leak dripped at night, and the silver tassel knotted. But unexpectedly, although the scenery of Jiangnan was beautiful, the situation in Yushang was urgent. The words were still in his ears, but the oath had been forgotten.

### Confessions of a Liar

— Against My Will

No one can deny that lying is a sin. Lying not only deceives people, but also affects the credibility of the entire population due to the lying of a few, creating a social psychology of mutual deception and suspicion. We should deeply hate and despise such black sheep.

I hate lying, I love telling the truth. How refreshing and reassuring it is to tell the truth! I don't need to bother fabricating it, and I don't have to worry about people suspecting me. But, how strange! I am actually a liar, from childhood until now! Why do I lie? It is the environment that forces me to do so. If I don't lie, I will suffer a lot of unnecessary troubles and unreasonable obstructions, and it will hinder my minimum right to live. I lie for myself less often, and for others more often. In order to avoid lying, my own interests are often sacrificed, but in order to fight for the deserved right to live for others, I spare no effort to devise lies. I not only help those who are oppressed like me to lie, but also often lie for the benefit of those who oppress us. I do not admit that my lying is a sin or that it harms my personality, because general lying is for the purpose of harming others and benefiting oneself, but my lying is for the benefit of both myself and others, and sometimes it is entirely for the sake of benefiting others.

However, although I do not admit that my lying is a sin, I am always unwilling to lie, and I always feel that this is an improper means. I am very reluctant to lie, but at the same time, I feel that being too reluctant will make the other party suspicious, so I have to reluctantly make it sound serious. This taste of reluctance is not easily experienced by those who do not lie, but this taste of reluctance is not the most difficult to bear. The most difficult to bear is fear: when lying, I fear that the lie is not told properly, that there are any flaws or loopholes. Once I have lied, I fear that things will be exposed and the lie will be seen through, so I must always be prepared to cover up and plan to conceal the "what ifs". This puts my nerves in a state of tension and unease, from childhood until now!

Let me leave this environment that forces me to lie! I am afraid of lying, lying makes me too painful! (Proceeds donated to children's library)

### Diplomatic Style

— Hu Bei

U.S. Secretary of State Hull is one of the outstanding diplomatic talents. He is not only good with words, but also very careful in his speech, always striving for accuracy at all times.

Once, on a train, a friend pointed to a group of sheep grazing outside the window and said, "Those sheep have just been sheared."

Hull looked at them, pondered for a moment, and said, "In any case, the wool on this side has been shorn."

### Regarding Advertising Disputes

— Min

While the advertising dispute between Sun Jinglu and a certain chemical industrial company has not been resolved, Chen Yunshang is also about to sue more than a dozen manufacturers who used her photos as advertisements. It is said that using movie stars as promotional tools has been "the norm since ancient times", and is even more "rampant now".

The reason why this method of "promotion" has been passed down through the generations and has been safe and sound is naturally due to its origins. For example, requests from friends cannot be refused due to personal relationships; or there may be some gifts, and that settles it. Thus, not only fundraising, but also opening ceremonies must have the top ten stars, and even a magazine or some tonic is promoted with the names of celebrities. Furthermore, there is a group of people who specialize in this, running around the doors of movie stars, acting as introducers for both parties.

In terms of human relationships, requests from friends seem inconvenient to reject outright; even gifts are not unreasonable. But how did Sun Jinglu's advertising dispute arise? This cannot be blamed on the general "specialists". I remember when a certain "amusement park" in the South City opened, it actually published advertisements for stars cutting ribbons. Is this something that "requests" and "gifts" can accomplish? And the fact that no star arrived on the scene proves the "middleman's" clumsiness.

As for the inside story of the advertising disputes between Sun Jinglu and Chen Yunshang, we outsiders are naturally unable to know, but it can be expected that it is definitely beyond "requests" and "gifts". However, the occurrence of this dispute also serves as a warning to those who are stars. If all movie workers can reject "requests" and "gifts" in advance, then neither the "middlemen" nor the manufacturers will be able to play these "tricks".

### Confucius Film and Music

— Qin Ou Zhang

"Confucius" is a historical education film, and in terms of historical sites, some research work has been done! Otherwise, it would not be enough to speak of truth. The relationship between music and film is to enhance the effect of the performance; the so-called "dubbing" should at least achieve this. Whether it is a very short interlude or a piece of music, it must be in the same mood and rhythm as the "play". However, the "play" of "Confucius" is to research classical books; in terms of music, it seems that one also has to research classical books. In fact, taking the music of the Confucius era and pairing it with the "play" may not be suitable. This is the first difficult problem before dubbing.

According to the records in books, "music" is only found in "The Book of Rites" (music was lost in the Qin fire). However, there are only words but no scores. Looking at the records from further back, there is only music for sacrificing to Confucius, but no music from the Confucius era. After much consideration, it was decided to extract the notation from "The Complete Book of Music and Pitch" written by Zhu Zaiyu of the Ming Dynasty, as well as melodies from other ancient books such as Qin scores, and use them to create scores.

However, after extracting them, it was discovered that they were entirely (it can be said) music from a prosperous era, completely inconsistent with the rhythm of the "play". It must be reorganized before the music that is most suitable for the "play" can be found (such as using "Guan Ju" for "Apricot Altar", "Zou Yu" for "Village Archery", and "Ancient Southern Wind" for "Zi Jian Nan Zi", etc.).

In this way, a part of the melody was solved, but there were still many parts of the "play" that needed ancient music. Therefore, one had to be bold in creating, but still mainly used the pentatonic scale.

However, in the "Yanzi and the Old Beggar" section of the "play", the Ti note outside the pentatonic scale was used. Many people thought that Chinese music rarely uses the Ti note. In fact, we did not use it as a "leading tone", but as a "passing tone".

As for instruments, ancient Chinese instruments were used: such as Xun, Chi, Sheng, Guan, Qin, Se, as well as percussion instruments such as Zhong, Qing, Gu, Tao, etc. Speaking of types, seven kinds of instruments have been used: metal, stone, silk, bamboo, leather, gourd, and earth. In terms of timbre, there was a surplus of softness and beauty, but a lack of tension. Moreover, because the instruments were not manufactured scientifically, the "tones" were not accurate. One could only use as many possible Chinese instruments as possible, and had to use Western instruments as substitutes (taking those whose timbre was closest to Chinese instruments). It must be stated here that although the instruments are Western, they are only used as tools.

### "Confucius" Specially Sets Up Preferential Measures for Groups

Schools, organizations, etc. requesting group preferential treatment to visit the "Confucius" film have been decided by Minhua Manager Jin Xinmin and Jincheng owner Liu Zhonghao.
