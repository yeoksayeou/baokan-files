### Prince Sha Issues a Letter to Fellow Compatriots

Yulin: On New Year's Day, Prince Sha issued a letter to Mongolian compatriots in Yikezhao League, stating that, "On the occasion of the New Year, we should get rid of the old and bring in the new." He specifically listed eight matters that should be actively worked on in the future, pooling our collective wisdom and efforts to achieve them. (1) Omitted. (2) "For the popularization of Mongolian education, Mongolian culture is extremely backward, and the implementation of education is extremely urgent. Last summer, the Yikezhao League Middle School was established, and the primary schools in various banners have been restored one after another, clearly marking this purpose. The Yikezhao League Middle School should expand its facilities and recruit young people from Mongolian banners and war-torn areas to the school this year. Each banner should establish complete primary schools this year to popularize education." (3) Omitted. (4) "For health facilities, Mongolian banners have always lacked these. Last year, the Suiyuan-Mongolia Association decided to establish medical clinics and mobile hospitals in the association and various banners. The medical clinic of the Mongolia Association has now been established and has begun treatment. Each banner should also widely establish these clinics this year in order to benefit poor and sick compatriots." (5) "For the investigation of household registration and organization of Baojia, this is the basic mechanism for implementing autonomy. During this time of resistance war, we should actively engage in this. In addition to ordering each banner to strictly comply, the Suiyuan-Mongolia Association will regularly send personnel to various banners this year to provide concrete guidance." (6) "For increasing production, Mongolian banners span the north and south of the Yellow River, with vast territories and abundant resources. In addition to encouraging people to work hard in production, the Suiyuan-Mongolia Association will immediately develop all kinds of resources and control the economy to shatter the Japanese troops' dream of using war to support war." (7) "For improving animal husbandry, before the 'July 7th' Incident, the Mongolia Association had established a number of ranches in Suiyuan, specializing in improving livestock breeds and disease prevention. Subsequently, due to the Mongolia Association's move south, it was virtually suspended. It was decided last autumn to continue the work. This year, we will first improve the existing ranches in various banners and hire experienced veterinarians to prevent diseases." (8) "For banning opium, opium is extremely harmful in Mongolian banners. This year, we must strictly prohibit the cultivation and smoking of opium in order to eradicate it." The above eight matters are all urgent tasks for Mongolian banners and must be implemented this year. I hope that my Mongolian compatriots will work hard and concentrate our strength to achieve them together," and so on. (8th dispatch)

### Shandong Guerrilla Teams Active Again; British Consulate Notifies Nationals to Report Property Details

Qingdao: The British Consulate recently issued a notice asking British nationals in Qingdao to report details of British property throughout Shandong Province, especially in the vicinity of Laiyang between Qingdao and Yantai. It is widely believed that the reason for this notice from the British Consul General is that the Shandong guerrilla teams have suddenly become active again. The notice stated, "The Consulate has received written notice from the Japanese Consul General, stating that the Japanese side has begun military operations on land and sea against bandits in the interior of Shandong, and in order to take steps to prevent nationals of third countries from suffering losses in military operations, the Qingdao Japanese authorities hope to obtain detailed reports stating the location and facilities of British property in various parts of Shandong where bandits are active, especially in the vicinity of Laiyang, and please indicate the markings on these properties that can be seen from the air. We hope to reply as soon as possible." The British Consul General's notice was issued at a time when guerrilla activity in Shandong has resumed. The guerrilla teams in Laiyang, Qixia, and other places are the most active. The railway between Qingdao and Jinan has been blocked for two days west of Qingdao in Gaomi. Japanese naval aircraft took off from aircraft carriers anchored here and flew repeatedly to the interior to bomb, presumably attacking the guerrilla teams. (Reuters dispatch from the 10th)

They will depart within days. (9th dispatch)

### Sun Ke Discusses Constitutional Government Issues

Chongqing: The issue of constitutional government has now become the focus of national attention and heated discussion. A reporter from the Central News Agency visited Legislative Yuan President Sun Ke on the morning of the 10th to inquire about his views on the implementation of constitutional government. He said that, strictly speaking, our country does not yet fully possess the general basic conditions for the implementation of constitutional government, but at this time of resistance war and national reconstruction, it is an important path, because constitutional government and political tutelage are complementary from a broad perspective. Political tutelage is the cornerstone of constitutional government, and constitutional government is indeed the compass for making political tutelage reach perfection. Therefore, the early implementation of constitutional government does not hinder the promotion of political tutelage. On this point, Premier Sun Yat-sen had incisive explanations. I believe that what should be paid attention to in the future is how to organize good local representative organs and how to earnestly complete local self-government. Constitutional government is greatly related to the development of civil rights, and I hope that the whole country will work together to achieve it. When I was in Europe, I saw that people from various countries praised our constitutional movement and believed that China, in the midst of a difficult and arduous resistance war, can still strive to develop democratic politics. The revival of the nation can be seen in this spirit. President Sun continued, "This year, many democratic countries in Europe have changed to a centralized system, and after the outbreak of the European War, even more countries are tending to reduce democracy. Only our country has actively promoted democratic politics for more than two years of resistance war. This characteristic is indeed a great development that has attracted international attention." President Sun concluded that the functions of the implementation of constitutional government can be summarized in three points: first, to complete political tutelage and consolidate the foundation of civil rights; second, to build people's political education and cultivate a standard democratic spirit; and third, to concentrate the people's will and complete the work of national reconstruction.

### University Presidents Send Telegrams to US Senate and House of Representatives Calling for Economic Sanctions Against Japan

Chongqing: The presidents of various universities in China recently sent telegrams to members of the US Senate and House of Representatives, requesting that Japan be subjected to economic sanctions during its war of aggression against China. (10th dispatch)

Chongqing: According to Methodist Bishop Huade today to the United Press, "In my observation, there will be no new commercial treaty between Japan and the United States, because a treaty is not something that can be created overnight. However, economic sanctions against Japan will not be realized, but the export of military materials and raw materials from the United States to Japan will be stopped, because the American people do not want this trade to continue. As for a temporary agreement, I don't think there will be one, because if the United States signs a temporary commercial agreement with Japan, it is tantamount to helping the wicked and participating in Japan's war against China." In short, the American people sympathize with any nation striving for independence and autonomy. (United Press dispatch from the 10th)

### Situation in Xi'an Remains the Same After Bombing

Qingdao: Some foreigners who entered the Japanese-controlled area from the free area of the Chinese side, traveling through Zhengzhou and Kaifeng, have recently arrived in Qingdao. They claimed that the number of Soviet military advisors in Xi'an has greatly increased in recent months. The Japanese side claimed that Xi'an had been "destroyed" after being heavily bombed in October, which is actually inaccurate. The city is still in a normal situation. One corner of the old Drum Tower in the city center was bombed off, and the YMCA dormitory is no longer there, leaving only a pile of rubble. The Bank of China and the newly built Jiabin Hotel (transliteration) were damaged, but there are few other signs of damage. The morale of the people in Xi'an is surprisingly high, but merchants have many difficulties in handling goods. (Reuters dispatch from the 10th)

The Chongqing branch was established by the central executive committee of this organization in Shanghai after Chongqing suffered heavy bombing last year. Other cities such as Xi'an and Yichang have also established such branches after being heavily bombed by Japanese aircraft. It is reported that Shanghai has remitted 120,000 yuan to Xi'an and Yichang. The Chongqing branch has received a donation of 75,000 yuan from the Chongqing branch of Butterfield & Swire, and also a donation of 3,000 yuan from British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr.

### US Congressman Suggests China Not Station Foreign Troops, a Reasonable Solution to Far East Problems

Washington: Democratic Congressman Voorhis told reporters last night that the troops of the United States, Japan, and other countries must be completely withdrawn from Chinese territory so that the Chinese can handle everything themselves without interference from other countries, because "this is a reasonable solution to the various difficulties in the Far East. This concept should not be regarded as strange. I believe that the Japanese will not completely ignore my suggestion." If this can be done, then after the outbreak of the European War, Britain and France have already withdrawn their troops stationed in China, and the United States and other countries may also follow in the footsteps of Britain and France and withdraw their troops stationed there. Voorhis then criticized members of Congress who "do not fully understand the situation in the Far East" and rashly made discussions, saying that congressional members issuing statements at will will hinder "others from trying to do constructive work." He plans to hold several meetings with government leaders this week to learn the truth about the status of US-Japan trade after the 1911 US-Japan Commercial Treaty expires on January 26. (United Press dispatch from the 10th)

Editorial

### The Struggles of the Japanese Abe Cabinet

A segment of the Japanese Diet members launched a movement to overthrow the cabinet at the end of last year, and the situation has gradually become serious in recent days. According to a Tokyo telegram yesterday, it is rumored that Army Minister Shunroku Hata has directly stated to Prime Minister Abe that the "resolution" of the "China Incident" is not a sufficient reason to extend the life of the cabinet, intending to urge Abe to resign. At the same time, senior officials in political circles also expressed dissatisfaction because Abe ignored the demands of the Diet members. According to Tokyo news obtained by a certain party last night, it is claimed that Shunroku Hata has begun working behind the scenes to form a new cabinet. It is evident that the main trend of this cabinet overthrow movement has expanded from the parliament to the cabinet itself, and has developed from advocacy to concrete issues. In recent years, Japanese cabinets have been completely manipulated by the military: the formation or dissolution of the cabinet depends on the support or opposition of the military. Abe came to power in this way four months ago; now that he is about to step down, how can he escape this exception?

However, so far, Abe's side has not shown any signs of concession and is struggling to the utmost; it is still difficult to predict whether there will be rapid changes in the near future. As for the truth of this cabinet crisis, the Tokyo telegram is not sufficient for reference. On the surface, it is for domestic affairs, for policies such as food and prices, which cannot be fully satisfactory; but judging from the attitude of the military, it can be known that the reality will not be so simple. Abe is, of course, fully aware of this situation, so he is not doing any remedial work on policies such as food and prices; instead, he wants to find ways to extend the life of the current cabinet from another aspect. Therefore, he also adopted the old method of past Japanese politicians, using foreign events to ease domestic problems. He is doing his best to carry out the so-called establishment of a "new central government" in China, hoping to use this to extricate himself from the quagmire in China; and to use it to entice the United States to conclude a new trade treaty. It is rumored that this matter has been passed in the Japanese cabinet meeting and has been submitted to the Emperor for approval; Tokyo also has rumors of a so-called peace treaty (?), the main points of which are: (1) Recognition of "Manchukuo," (2) Signing of an anti-communist alliance, (3) Japanese troops stationed in North China and Inner Mongolia, (4) Joint Sino-Japanese development of Chinese resources, (5) Japanese troops withdraw from Central and South China in two years, (6) Chinese railways are nationalized.

Abe's attempt to end the "China Incident" to deal with the cabinet overthrow movement is a timely political strategy. Originally, 1940 was a critical juncture in Japan's national fortune: First, the domestic economy not only cannot support a long-term war, but it cannot even maintain the function of society. At the end of last year, Japanese domestic banknotes had expanded to 4 billion yen; 80% of the government bonds issued last year were still in the government's treasury; most tax rates have been increased, but tax revenues have decreased compared to the past; at the same time, the new budget compiled for the whole year is as high as 10.3 billion yen, an increase of about 950 million yen compared to the previous year. May I ask where such a large source of funds can be obtained? Secondly, the trade agreement with the United States will soon be abolished, and it is clear that there is no possibility of a new trade agreement or a temporary trade agreement being realized, which means that the United States may impose economic sanctions at any time; then all Japanese economic activities will suffer huge blows due to raw materials and market problems. When the Japanese Diet meets on the 20th of this month, even if the attacks on food and price policies are not enough to force Abe to step down, the above-mentioned serious problems will also make him at a loss and eventually lead to his retirement. Therefore, he is full of hope that the "China Incident" can be declared resolved due to the establishment of the so-called "new central government," so that he can retire with honor.

However, reality and fantasy are often tens of millions of miles apart. Abe only has the right to maintain his own illusions, but how can reality adapt to illusions? How could Konoe and Hiranuma in the past not have had the same illusions, but the facts have disappointed them all. Now Abe's plan to resolve the "China Incident" does not have any new progress in content, so how can it obtain any unexpected development? Like the above-mentioned so-called "Sino-Japanese Peace Treaty," regardless of its content, at least the war is still the war, the quagmire is still the quagmire, may I ask where is the peace?

The Japanese military has long clearly pointed out that Abe's plan to resolve the "China Incident" will not succeed. Shunroku Hata said that the cabinet should not take the resolution of the China Incident as a reason to extend its life, which means that the China Incident is far away. The military is the creator of the China Incident, controls the domestic politics of Japan, and is also trapped in the quagmire. Therefore, they must be able to understand that Abe's fantasy is only a fantasy.

### The US Navy Focuses on the Pacific: Strengthening Guam's Defense Works; Building a Super Battleship of 50,000 Tons - A Congressional Proposal Is Worth Noting

Washington - Admiral Harold R. Stark, Chief of Naval Operations, testified before the House Naval Affairs Committee yesterday that the Navy Department requested an appropriation of $4,000,000 in the next fiscal year for improving Guam's defense facilities, such as deepening seaplane runways and building breakwaters. This appropriation is included in the budget of the Fourteenth Naval District in Hawaii. Admiral Stark told reporters that Guam has unlimited value for the United States, not only for the use of the air and naval forces, but also for the needs of commercial aircraft. "After Guam is fortified, its value is equal to two or three battleships." He estimates that it would cost $80 million to use Guam as a base for maritime aircraft, submarines, and small warships, and that it would cost $500 million to fully fortify the island. (United Press, 10th)

Washington - Admiral Stark's statement in the House of Representatives that there is an urgent need to establish a maritime aircraft base on Guam in the Pacific Ocean has aroused the excitement and attention of people in the House. Stark said that the required funding is quite large, and the first phase is requested to be $4 million (US dollars). Last year, the Navy Department made this request, but it was rejected by the House of Representatives. The main reason for the rejection was that Guam is only 1,500 miles from Tokyo, and building a maritime aircraft base on the island would be regarded as a provocative action by Japan. Now that senior officials of the Navy Department have reiterated the old matter regardless of the opposition of the House, it seems that they are determined to implement their proposal. (Haitong Telegram, above date)

Washington - Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Stark recently continued to report on the contents of the naval expansion plan to the House Naval Affairs Committee, saying that Congress had approved the Navy Department's construction of two battleships of 45,000 tons last year. The Navy Department is now planning to build super battleships of 50,000 to 52,000 tons, and plans to test 18-inch caliber guns. If the test is successful, it will be the largest naval gun in the world. However, such a giant warship will not be started this year. As for the two battleships that President Roosevelt requested Congress to build last week, their average speed per hour is set at 32 miles, which is actually no different from the 45,000-ton battleships. In addition, the Navy Department also requested an appropriation of $4 million to improve Guam's port facilities (Havas, 9th)

Washington - According to reliable sources, the Federal Shipping Commission is now planning to build two giant ships of 35,000 tons, which will be added to the Pacific route during peacetime, but can be converted into aircraft carriers in the event of war. Regarding this matter, the committee will formally issue a statement in the short term (Havas, 9th)

### The United States Actively Promotes Its Far East Policy: Philippine Newspaper Comments on Gauss's Appointment as Minister to Australia

Manila - The "Manila" Gazette commented today that the US government's appointment of the current Consul General in Shanghai, Gauss, as the first US Minister to Australia is a manifestation of the "United States'" further attention to its Far East policy. It also said that although Australia is no longer within the scope of Far Eastern diplomacy, it is extremely relevant to the entire Far Eastern policy. This time, the US government has selected a competent person for this position, and we are also deeply fortunate that the US government has found the right person. Because Gauss was appointed to this new position after the talks held in Manila between Gauss and the commander of the US Asiatic Fleet, Hart, and the US High Commissioner to the Philippines, Sayre, it has made all parties pay more attention (United Press, 10th)

### Under Military Pressure, the Abe Cabinet Is Shaking: Abe's Attitude Suddenly Turns Negative, Successor Being Sought

Tokyo - The local morning papers still focus on the cabinet crisis. The Asahi Shimbun reported, "Prime Minister Abe is exhausted, and after talking with Army Minister Shunroku Hata yesterday, his attitude has shown a significant change, and it seems that he has reached a conclusion that the resignation of his cabinet is inevitable." At the same time, the army generals are still holding meetings and paying close attention to the overall situation, and feel that the current state of political unrest cannot be tolerated for longer. The public is concerned about the overall situation and predicts that the candidate to succeed Abe is the former Prime Minister Konoe, who is now actively meeting with various politicians. However, it is heard that Konoe may not accept this position. Sugiyama, Terauchi, and the current Army Minister Shunroku Hata may also serve as Prime Minister, but the financial and political circles are still listening to Ugaki (Reuters, 10th)

Hong Kong - Tokyo telegram: General Ugaki returned to his private residence in Tokyo from his seaside villa yesterday, and returned to the villa in the afternoon, refusing to meet with reporters. It is claimed that he only took a few books with him. The Asahi Shimbun newspaper, which previously predicted that Abe would still try to deal with the parliament to the end regardless of the decision of the cabinet overthrow faction when the parliament reopens, reported today that Abe's psychology on the political situation has changed. Army personnel said that resolving the "China Incident" is their responsibility. This move is extremely important, because Prime Minister Abe has stated that resolving the "China Incident" is the greatest mission of the current cabinet. Now that the army personnel have made this statement, it has increased the political unrest. Abe's current position also requires the presence of army personnel, which is completely different in nature from dealing with the decision of the cabinet overthrow faction. The Prime Minister believes that the actions of the Diet members to overthrow the cabinet are outside the parliament, so he is not responsible. It is expected that the crisis in the political situation will take a sharp turn in the next few days (Telegram, 10th)

### Japan Seeks to Enhance Friendship with the United States: Hoping for Further Development Before the Expiration of the Trade Treaty

Tokyo - According to Foreign Ministry spokesman Suma today, although the date of the next meeting between US Ambassador to Japan Grew and Japanese Foreign Minister Nomura has not been determined, Japan hopes to have constructive development before the US-Japan Trade Treaty expires on January 26. Japan is now doing its utmost to resolve the pending issues between the two countries. According to the spokesman, the problem between Japan and the United States is not a matter of responsibility but a matter of friendship. He also said that Japan's feelings towards the United States are still extremely friendly, so it hopes that the United States also has the same feelings towards Japan (United Press, date withheld)

Tokyo - When a Foreign Ministry spokesman met with reporters today, he was asked whether many of the issues between Japan and the United States in China had been resolved last month. The spokesman said that several issues were under consideration, but none had been truly resolved. He was also asked whether there were any results from the Tianjin American Chamber of Commerce's request to improve the blockade restrictions. The spokesman replied that the Japanese authorities are doing their best to respect foreign rights in China (Reuters, 10th)

### Another Link in Balkan Diplomacy: Italy Courts Turkey; Turkish Economic Delegation Arrives in Rome; The Italy-Hungary-Yugoslavia Triangle Group Takes Concrete Form

Paris - Italy and Turkey are both extremely concerned about the situation in the Balkan Peninsula. Therefore, the relationship between the two countries has become one of the most important links in the Balkan problem. Political figures here recently commented on this matter, saying that Turkey, as one of the Balkan Entente countries (Greece, Romania, Yugoslavia, and Turkey), naturally shares the same fate as the rise and fall of Southeast Europe. When the foreign ministers of Italy and Hungary met in Venice, Italy a few days ago, they had already thoroughly discussed the issue of the balance of power in the Balkan Peninsula. Once the Balkan Entente countries hold a meeting in the capital of Yugoslavia on the 2nd of next month, they will inevitably discuss the "Venice Plan," which is to avoid the invasion of the Balkan Peninsula by other countries, which has been decided by Italy and Hungary, to see if it can be implemented. Also, Hungarian Foreign Minister Csáky will visit Italy again in the shortest possible time to meet with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini to explain Hungary's views on the "Venice Plan." In short, the Balkan problem is a complex problem that urgently needs to find a concrete solution. However, whether it can be resolved depends entirely on the attitudes of Hungary, Italy, and Turkey. This is because Hungary must temporarily abandon its territorial claims against Romania (the Transylvania province of Romania originally belonged to Hungary before the last European war, and Hungary has always intended to reclaim it), pending further deliberation after the end of this European war. Secondly, the attitudes of Romania and Yugoslavia must also be paid attention to. Because Transylvania, Romania can be regarded as the outpost of Southeast Europe resisting Soviet invasion, this is one reason. If Italy wants to send troops to Hungary to help it resist invasion, it must pass through Yugoslavia, so the position of Yugoslavia is also extremely important, this is the second reason. Moreover, both Yugoslavia and Hungary are Balkan Entente countries, and when accepting any plan, they must take into account their connection with the other two signatory countries of the Balkan Entente, namely Turkey and Greece. Among them, Turkey has always occupied an extremely important position in the Balkan Peninsula and has the decisive power over the situation in the Balkans. Therefore, any Balkan plan is unlikely to succeed unless it obtains the consent of Italy and Turkey. From this, it can be seen that the arrival of the Turkish economic delegation in Rome today is a good sign of the good relationship between the two countries (Havas, 9th)

Hungary - The semi-official Hungarian newspaper "Hungarian Jing Lao Yi Bao" recently carried a telegram from a visiting reporter in the capital of Yugoslavia, saying that the relations between Hungary and Yugoslavia have improved, and the Italy-Hungary-Yugoslavia triangle group has gradually taken concrete form, which will form an important factor in the situation in Southeast Europe. In addition, Bulgaria and Greece may also join the triangle group (Havas, 10th)

Rome - Regarding the rumors carried in the London "Daily Mail" and other foreign newspapers that Romania is trying to obtain Italian assistance to protect Romania's interests in Bessarabia in exchange for Hungary's territorial demands, political figures here dismissed it as nonsense. Political figures solemnly stated that Romania is prepared to negotiate on the issue of ethnic minorities, but the cession of territory is not being considered, and the Hungarian government has not clearly expressed its demands for amending the Treaty of Trianon. Only Hungarian public opinion generally demands the return of all territories before the Treaty of Trianon was signed. According to the Treaty of Trianon, Hungary ceded a total of 102,282 kilometers of territory to Romania (Haitong Telegram, 10th)

Budapest - The semi-official Hungarian News Agency announced last night that the rumor spread by the Roman newspaper "Lavoro Bao" that Hungarian Foreign Minister Csáky will visit Rome on the 11th of this month is not in line with the facts (Haitong Telegram, 10th)

Rome - Political observers here learned that Hungarian Foreign Minister Chai Ji flew from Budapest to Rome to meet with Mussolini after the news that Italian Foreign Minister Ciano had proposed a definite cooperative proposal from the Italian government at a meeting in Venice at the end of the week. The communiqué issued at the time stated that the opinions of the two governments were completely consistent. Generally, it is expected that Chai Ji will announce that Hungary and Italy have reached a complete agreement. Chai Ji originally planned to go to San Remo for vacation, but after the talks in Venice, he suddenly urged to return to Budapest. It is believed that Chai Ji had to change his original plan because Italy had some important suggestions (Reuters, 10th)

Rome - The news carried in yesterday's evening papers confirmed that Hungarian Foreign Minister Sáki will come to Rome to discuss important matters with Italian Foreign Minister Ciano, and plans to pay respects to Prime Minister Mussolini and report everything. It is generally believed that Hungary's political activities this time are related to the resolution of the Danube Basin and the Balkan issue, and Italy is paying close attention to it (Haitong Telegram, 10th)

### Hungary and Greece Sign Temporary Trade Agreement

Budapest - The trade agreement between Hungary and Greece has expired. Foreign Minister Csáky signed a temporary agreement with the Greek Minister to Hungary, Bibi Nairis, at the Foreign Ministry yesterday, stipulating that the trade agreement and clearing agreement between the two countries will be extended, and some of its provisions will be revised (Havas, 10th)

### Lithuania Achieves Considerable Success in Trade Negotiations with Three Countries

Kaunas - The Lithuanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs is currently conducting trade negotiations with several countries, of which the negotiations with Germany are particularly prominent. Due to the European War, Lithuania has encountered difficulties in trade with distant countries, so it wants to increase trade activities with neighboring countries to compensate for its losses. Therefore, the possibility of promoting the exchange of goods is being discussed. The commercial representatives of Latvia and Estonia will arrive in the Lithuanian capital in the middle of this month to continue the negotiations held by the heads of the economic departments of the three countries in Riga. It is heard that the main purpose is to adopt common principles in international trade and take common actions in purchasing raw materials. Currently, the Lithuanian commercial delegation is in Berlin discussing the technical issues of the free port zone in Memel, such as issues related to the customs organization. The responsible party believes that normal trade can begin in the Lithuanian free port zone on January 15 (Haitong Telegram, 10th)

### London Newspapers Report on German-Italian Relations: Göring and Others Dissatisfied with Pro-Soviet Stance

London - According to reports in local newspapers, a dispute has arisen between Germany and Italy since Germany refused to allow Italian arms to transit through the country to Finland, and it is likely to cause serious consequences in the future. The Times correspondent in Rotterdam, Netherlands also telegraphed that Italy's determination to prevent the Soviet Union from expanding its influence in Southeast Europe is enough to strain relations between Germany and Italy. Germany will have to choose between Italy and the Soviet Union, two allied countries, in order to determine which country it is most beneficial to befriend. The Daily Express published a telegram from a correspondent in the capital of Denmark, saying that after the Soviet Union used troops against Finland, it suffered repeated setbacks. German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and Aviation Minister General Göring had become increasingly at odds with each other as a result. General Göring openly criticized the government's pro-Soviet policy, which became increasingly blatant. Although some generals previously supported the establishment of an alliance treaty with the Soviet Union to protect the security of the eastern front, at this point, these generals all believe that the Soviet Union is no longer a threat to Germany, and they are gradually dissatisfied with the government's current policy. The decline in Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's prestige is also an important reason (Havas, 10th)

### Belgium and the Netherlands Continue Economic Cooperation

Brussels - Officials here said that the rumors that Belgium does not intend to cooperate with the Netherlands in overseas cargo transportation in the future are not credible. The purpose of the economic negotiations recently conducted in the capitals of Belgium and the Netherlands is none other than to maintain the commercial agreements between the two countries (Haitong Telegram, 10th)

### British 10,000-Ton Mail Ship Dunbar Castle Sank After Hitting a Mine the Night Before Last; German Official Gazette Admits Airstrike on British Ship; Two Danish Vessels Also Sunk by German Bombs

London - Another large British merchant ship (10,000 tons) was recently hit by a mine in a minefield off the southeast coast of England. The ship was the mail ship Dunbar Castle, which sank after hitting a mine last night. There were a total of 200 passengers and crew on board, and 78 passengers have been rescued ashore, while the rest are feared to have died. The captain and first mate were among the injured. It is reported that the Dunbar Castle was built in 1930 (Reuters Telegram, 10th)

London - The Dunbar Castle sank yesterday after hitting a German mine off the southeast coast of England. The ship was sailing from England to Cape Town and carried a total of 200 passengers and crew. The wheelhouse and deck were destroyed by the explosion after hitting the mine. Captain Canston and two crew members were killed on the spot. A total of about 48 passengers boarded lifeboats and drifted at sea before being rescued by a motor barge and sent ashore. According to survivors, the ship set anchor at 9:00 a.m. yesterday, and shortly after lunch, a huge explosion was heard, shaking the entire ship. The lights went out, and the ship began to list to starboard. At that time, the passengers on board were not flustered and all wanted to return to their cabins to pack their clothes and valuables, but they all failed to do so. Later, they all gathered on the deck and boarded the lifeboats before being rescued. The surviving crew and passengers expressed their condolences for the heroic death of Captain Canston (Reuters Telegram, 10th)

Berlin - The official gazette issued here yesterday stated that German fighter planes flew to the east coast of England and Scotland on the morning and evening of the 9th to scout and attack several British munitions ships and armed merchant ships. The German planes safely returned to their defense zone after completing their mission (Haitong Telegram, 10th)

London - German pilots yesterday again carried out their terror tactics against merchant ships, fishing boats, and other non-combatant vessels, with the attack on a ship of Trinity Church being the most brutal. At the time, the ship was performing relief work, so it was carrying a large number of people. An injured person recently described the situation of a German plane dropping bombs, saying that several bombs hit the ship, and everyone rushed to the lifeboats in an attempt to escape. However, the German plane dived down and strafed with machine guns, piercing the boats, causing the deck to be covered with wounded. Some of the wounded are now being treated in hospitals, and they have been injured by bullets and shrapnel, and their injuries are quite serious (Reuters Telegram, 10th)

As a result, Soviet troops retreated several kilometers east of Suomussalmi. Reconnaissance activities occurred in the Repola and Petrozavodsk districts. Artillery fire in the Karelian Isthmus gradually diminished. Air force activities were limited by adverse weather conditions. (TASS, 10th)

Helsinki: A large number of Soviet troops concentrated in the Salla area have begun to launch an offensive after weeks of fierce fighting in the forests. It is reported that Soviet troops have occupied the village of Salla, located 65 kilometers from the Soviet border, and advanced 40 kilometers towards Kemijärvi.

Helsinki: The Finnish President received foreign journalists today and issued a statement, strongly condemning the Soviet aircraft for indiscriminately bombing undefended cities and strafing civilians with machine guns. He stated, "Soviet bandits are fighting against our troops, and furthermore, they send aircraft to our rear every day to massacre civilians and bomb civilian houses. Fortunately, our country has taken effective preventive measures in advance. Although the casualties among the people are not extremely high, they are still appalling. In the past month, there have been over 700 casualties, including 234 deaths, 269 seriously injured, and 210 slightly injured. As for enemy aircraft shot down by us, there have already been as many as 170. Our air defense capabilities are also increasing daily due to the capture of many Soviet anti-aircraft guns." (United Press, 9th)

Stockholm: Prince Ferdinand of Liechtenstein has arrived in Helsinki to join the Finnish army. Liechtenstein is a small country between Switzerland and Vorarlberg (formerly Austria). (Reuters, 10th)

Stockholm: The "Svenska Dagbladet" here reports that Finnish troops have captured several Soviet armored snowmobiles on the front line of Suomussalmi. This is a secret weapon used by the Soviet Union to invade Finland. This type of snowmobile is shaped like a torpedo and equipped with a propeller, with a speed of up to 160 kilometers per hour. It is also equipped with a small cannon and is superior to tanks in traveling on snow. However, the armor is not thick. Under the intense machine gun fire of the Finnish troops, the drivers become overly excited and often lose control, which is its biggest weakness. According to Finnish officers, this new weapon is very easy to deal with. (Havas, 9th)

London: According to Rome radio news, the railway between Leningrad and Murmansk has repeatedly been cut off by Finnish ski patrols and bombers. According to a Helsinki telegram, Soviet aircraft raided six small Finnish towns this morning, causing minor damage and no casualties. (Reuters, 10th)

Washington: President Roosevelt recently told the press that he would submit various proposals to Congress in the near future regarding aid to Finland. He is currently working with the State Department, the War Department, the Treasury Department, and other relevant departments to study ways to provide assistance. Mr. Taylor, his personal representative to the Vatican, will come to Washington this week to meet with him again and then return to Florence, Italy, to be ready to travel to the Vatican at any time. In the past few days, he has met with delegations from the American Christian Lutheran Church, the Sabbath Church, and the Baptist Church to discuss the mission undertaken by Mr. Taylor. All of these delegations have not raised any objections to mutual cooperation in establishing lasting peace when the war ends. However, it is also true that some members of these churches are not very clear about the nature of Mr. Taylor's mission and have expressed dissatisfaction. (Havas, 10th)

### British War Cabinet Approves Establishment of Air Force Command in France; Barratt Appointed Commander-in-Chief, Will Take Office Soon; Artillery Battles on the Western Front, British Aircraft Reconnoiter Northwest Germany

London: 10 Downing Street announced last night that all British Royal Air Force units in France would be merged into the British Air Force in France, commanded by Air Marshal Barratt. (United Press, 10th)

London: Official circles announced that an Air Force Command will be established to govern all British Air Force units in France, named the "British Air Force in France" and placed under the command of the Air Force Commander-in-Chief. The Commander-in-Chief will consult with the relevant Army Commander-in-Chief and be responsible for ensuring that the British Air Force provides the most effective assistance to the British Expeditionary Force and the French Army on the Western Front. He will also work with the French Air Force Commander-in-Chief to coordinate the actions of the British and French Air Forces in France. The above arrangement does not change the principles of the relationship between the Army and the Air Force, but is based on the existing relationship between the British Navy and the Coastal Air Force Command, in order to ensure the closest cooperation between the land and air forces on the battlefield. In November of last year, the British authorities conducted a detailed review of the experience gained by the British Air Force in assisting the British Army in France. As a result, a proposal was made to establish the British Air Force Command in France. It was approved by the War Cabinet in early December. The Air Ministry stated that Air Chief Marshal Barratt has been appointed as the Commander-in-Chief of the British Air Force in France and will take office soon. (Reuters, 10th)

London: Regarding the appointment of Air Chief Marshal Barratt as the Commander of the British Air Force Front, responsible sources here recently stated that Commander Barratt is not subject to the control of General Gort, Commander of the British Expeditionary Force, but is directly responsible to Air Chief of Staff Newall. Air Chief Marshal Barratt is 48 years old this year and is one of the youngest British Air Force generals. He made outstanding military achievements during the last European War. After the war, he served as the chief instructor at the Andover Air Force College. In 1931, he was transferred to India as the commander of the Air Force Brigade in North Chahar. In 1936, he was transferred to the president of the Air Force College, and he has been there ever since. (Havas, 9th)

### German Naval Commander Delivers Speech Encouraging Dock Workers

Berlin: German Naval Commander-in-Chief Admiral Raeder delivered speeches to naval dock workers in Kiel and Wilhelmshaven on the previous two days, explaining the war aims of Germany and the Allied countries. His remarks were roughly as follows: "We are fighting for Germany's rights and for the future of Germany's descendants. If we unite and always stand behind the leader, Hitler, victory will surely belong to us. Our current responsibility is to lay a solid foundation for the country's livelihood. Our responsibility for creating history today is worth any sacrifice. Dock workers should work even harder in the future and strive to produce. Everyone should stick to their positions and do their best, so that whether they are at the front or in the rear, they will have great benefits for the motherland." (Hai Tong News Agency, 10th)

### Strange Aircraft Bombs Rømø Island, Denmark; Strange Aircraft Also Discovered in The Hague; Dutch Aircraft Lost and Lands in Belgium

According to the officers, they lost their way and lacked gasoline, so they had to land in Belgium. It is generally believed that since the aircraft belongs to a neutral country, it should be allowed to fly away. (Havas, 10th)

The Hague: This morning, an aircraft of unknown nationality flew over the vicinity of The Hague. Local anti-aircraft artillery immediately opened fire to drive it away. (Havas, 10th)

### Chamberlain Condemns Soviet Attack on Finland and Reiterates the Purpose of the Allied War

London: British Prime Minister Chamberlain strongly condemned the Soviet attack on Finland yesterday at the Mansion House, beginning a national propaganda campaign. Members of the War Cabinet will also address the public to reiterate the purpose of the Allied war and strengthen the public's determination to make sacrifices for the war. In his speech, Chamberlain (1) explained his firm intention to make every effort to achieve a victorious end to the war, (2) refuted the absurd claim that the Allied countries wanted to destroy the German people, (3) stated the necessity of increasing exports and reducing imports, (4) reviewed Britain's victory at sea, and (5) expressed the hope that the British-French commercial and economic agreement would continue until after the war. When Chamberlain mentioned Finland, he said, "When I look beyond the borders of this country, I always feel that the disasters I have mentioned before can easily and quickly spread if they are not quickly stopped. After Germany imposed barbaric force on unfortunate Poland, today we can see how it treats the people of Poland and Czechoslovakia, occupying its resources, seizing its food, shooting its people, and destroying its homes in order to relocate Germans. And Germans are also forced to leave the land where they have lived for generations. Germany and the Soviet Union signed an alliance and set an example for the Soviet Union to invade. So Finland is now attacked by the Soviet Union. Finland today is treading on snow and ice, fighting against stubborn enemies, and like us, what it is fighting for is also freedom and justice. Its patriotic enthusiasm and amazing victory make us admire it endlessly. What we can tell this loyal and brave people with certainty is that we must respond to the resolutions passed in Geneva and never make it a mere formality." The British Prime Minister continued to talk about his efforts to seek victory in the war, saying that since the day the war was declared, his thoughts and actions have been concentrated on one thing, that is, to make the war a victorious end through the closest cooperation between Britain and France. In order to achieve this goal, he considers the idea of fatigue, the views of parties, and personal feelings to be unimportant. As long as he is in office, no matter how difficult it is, he will never give up what he believes is a proper and inevitable responsibility until the war ends. This New Year is almost an eventful day in world history. Although the New Year has quietly passed, this is just the tranquility before the storm. The war can be said to be in full swing. Now, just reviewing the trends of the first four months after the start of the war at sea, the results are satisfactory. There are no more German ships in the world's oceans. Germany had less than a quarter of the number of ships as Britain at the beginning of the war. Now, due to being captured, sunk, or scuttled, it has lost 228,000 tons. The rest either hide in neutral ports or are in the Baltic Sea. Attacking our ships with submarines, raiding ships, or torpedoes is of course a broader target, but so far the results have been extremely small. If we offset our ship losses with the enemy ships we captured, the new ships we built, and the foreign ships we obtained, then our losses are now only 122,000 tons, which is less than 1% of our total ships. One thousand and one hundred million tons of British ships travel to and from the major oceans every day. During this period, we lost two large warships and several small warships. The more serious thing is that I am sure that our experience in wartime communication can be a valuable link that remains in place after the war and creates a broader and deeper connection. Because the work that can most easily facilitate peacebuilding is none other than this. And what can most promote the results of expanding British and French financial and economic cooperation to the European countries or to the entire world is also none other than this. "The British Prime Minister spoke again about domestic affairs, saying that since the implementation of compulsory military service, 2.5 million to 2.75 million people have registered and are ready to be called into the army at any time. With the addition of the regular army, reserve team, and auxiliary team before the war, the war will inevitably reduce this, or ask why not use the unemployed to manufacture civilian products. It is important to know that the number of unemployed people is misleading, because it includes 500,000 people who are doing this job today and changing to other things tomorrow. The rest are only temporarily unemployed, and their number will decrease day by day, because most of them are gradually being absorbed by military factories. Increasing exports and reducing imports are essential plans for us. Civilian meat will also be subject to a distribution system soon to limit it. There is no reason to say that there is a lack of healthy food in the country, but when necessary, we should expand the food distribution system. What is sad is the loss of some valuable lives in the navy and merchant fleet, but our maritime power has not been damaged at all. The failure of the German ship Spee is one of the best naval achievements in British history. The German ship sank itself without a fight, which not only eliminated the threat of the enemy ship wreaking havoc in the South Atlantic, but also caused irreparable damage to the reputation of the German navy in the world. The pressure of British maritime power on the enemy is now increasing its difficulties, and the results are not yet clear to the public, but it can be seen from the German leader's Christmas speech that they are paying attention to this. "The British Prime Minister then spoke about Britain's sympathy for the Turkish earthquake and flood, saying that the disaster in Turkey was very serious, and the number of casualties was more than all the casualties in the many weeks of the warring countries. The British and French governments have provided relief funds and will provide further assistance in the future. The cooperation between Britain and France in humanitarian undertakings is a testament to the close cooperation between the two countries, because Britain and France cooperate in all aspects of military, political, financial, and economic matters during the war. The automatic enlistment of volunteers and the increasingly expanding air force and navy show that the mobilization of British manpower for military purposes has now reached a very large scale. In addition, Britain also has a military-civilian defense system based on air defense preparations. The danger of air raids cannot be said to be over or reduced. It would be a big mistake not to continue the policy of defending against air raids. The children who had been evacuated have now returned to the cities. This is regrettable. I hope that parents will put their children in a safer place and endure the temporary separation of the family. This is also one of the sacrifices necessary to achieve the final victory. The British people are all determined to win victory and eliminate Germany's aggression policy, but they must not think that they can live a carefree life like in peacetime because the current war does not have the form of 1914. Although we are not currently having actual warfare on land, we are preparing to launch a major offensive at the appropriate time. Therefore, we are now pouring our manpower into the production of ammunition, so we are not hesitant about the manpower needed for civilian products. Finally, the British Prime Minister said, "Now it is becoming clearer and clearer that the German government has long planned a progressive stage of aggression. The more it gets, the more it wants. Today, German government officials openly claim that they want to achieve the goal of destroying the British Empire. Undoubtedly, they are eager to be able to treat us in the same way that they treat those in their grasp. But we have no such retaliatory intentions. To say that the Allied countries want to destroy the German people is absurd and malicious and can only be used for domestic propaganda. The German people must know that the responsibility for prolonging the war and causing suffering is not only borne by the German authorities, but also by the German people. They must know that the Allied countries' desire for a truly humane, just, and Christian solution is by no means satisfied by empty words that have been proven to be worthless by past experience. The methods adopted by the Hitler government are always a danger to the independence of the weak countries in Europe and always a great threat to the moral standards on which the entire Western civilization is based. The countries of North and South America have expressed particular disgust at this. President Roosevelt recently said in his speech, "Only the union of those who seek light and peace everywhere can stop the evil forces." I very much agree with this, but I have one thing to add. If the forces of justice are to prevail, we must sacrifice our blood and money to achieve this noble goal. We are now united with the determination to achieve this goal, and we have the support of the entire people of the Empire and the strength and determination of France." (Reuters, 10th)

### Eighteen Countries Respond to the League of Nations Appeal

Geneva: The Secretary-General of the League of Nations, Mr. Avenol, sent telegrams to member states and non-member states in December of last year, in accordance with the resolution of the League of Nations General Assembly (passed on December 14), appealing for assistance to Finland. So far, the governments of 18 countries have submitted replies (including 10 countries in the Americas). The reply from the government of the South African Republic stated, "We are discussing with the Red Cross how to provide humanitarian assistance to Finland." The reply from the Australian Federal Government stated, "We have decided to donate £10,000 to the Finnish government for Red Cross expenses and to allow fundraising throughout the Australian Federal Territory to assist the Finnish Red Cross." The reply from the Brazilian government stated, "Our government will fully support any fundraising campaign launched by private individuals." It is important to note that 12 member states that voted in favor of this resolution at that time have not yet replied. (Havas, 10th)

### German Birth Rate Exceeds That of Britain and France

### Yang Shoutong, Puppet Magistrate of Wuxi, Assassinated

Japanese Troops Close City for Search

Wuxi Correspondent: Since the puppet magistrate Qin Lianggong was transferred to the "Renovation Government" to serve as a puppet councilor, his vacancy was filled by Yang Shoutong. For more than a year, Yang has been trying to please the Japanese in every possible way and has won the favor of the Japanese side. At about 4 p.m. on the 9th of this month, Yang and two guards went out of the puppet office. After walking a few steps, they were suddenly attacked by several young and strong men who opened fire indiscriminately. Yang was seriously injured and died before he could be treated. Afterwards, the Japanese military police and the puppet police urgently closed the city gates and searched house to house, but there were no results. The city has now been closed for two days, and the outside of the city is also very strict. The searches at the station are even tighter. Regardless of gender, people must undress for inspection. Since this incident occurred, Japanese and puppet officials have been extremely panicked.

### The Tragic Situation of Japanese Bombing in Henan Province: Zheng County, Luoyang, Xinyang, and Nanyang Suffer the Greatest Damage; Remote Villages Also Unable to Avoid Japanese Bombing

Luoyang Dispatch: Since the War of Resistance, the Japanese army has dispatched a large number of air forces to bomb undefended Chinese cities, resulting in ruins everywhere and the suffering of the people. Not only have important cities been bombed, but even remote villages have been unable to avoid it. The extent of the damage is difficult to describe. The following is a summary of the damage suffered by Henan Province since the War of Resistance and the situation of air defense measures:

A. The Rampage of Japanese Aircraft in Various Regions of Henan Province

(1) The Situation of Bombing in Important Cities: 1. Kaifeng: In March of the previous year, during the Battle of Xuzhou, the Japanese army, while attacking Kaifeng, dispatched a large number of aircraft to bomb it extensively. It is estimated that Kaifeng alone suffered a total of sixteen bombings from the beginning of the War of Resistance until its fall. In particular, in May of the millennium, alarms were frequent, and tiles and pottery were destroyed in the Nanguan area. 2. Xinyang: Xinyang is a barrier to southern Henan and a gateway to Wuhan. In October of the year before last, the Japanese army launched a full-scale land and air offensive, attempting to cut off the Pinghan (Beijing-Hankou) Railway to capture Wuhan. Therefore, among the important cities in this province, besides Zheng County, Luoyang, and Nanyang, Xinyang suffered the most air raids. It is estimated that from the beginning of the War of Resistance until before its fall, it was bombed by Japanese aircraft twenty-two times. 3. Nanyang: Nanyang is an important town in southwestern Henan and also a bombing target for the Japanese army. In May of last year, the Japanese army, from Hubei Province, followed the Zaoshu River to harass Xinye Tanghe, attempting to capture Nanyang in order to threaten Xiangfan and Longdong. Thanks to the brave Chinese soldiers who fought hard for dozens of days, they successfully repelled the strong enemy. The Japanese army, due to military failure, vented its anger on innocent people. It is estimated that Nanyang has been bombed twenty-four times since the War of Resistance. 4. Zheng County and Luoyang: Zheng County is located at the intersection of the Pinghan and Longhai Railways, serving as a hub for the northern provinces. Its strategic importance far exceeds that of Kaifeng. Luoyang controls Hulao in the east and Hangu Pass in the west, and has always been a strategic location for military strategists. Therefore, the two cities of Zheng and Luo have long been under the Japanese army's attempt to occupy them. Knowing that the Yellow River is a natural barrier and the Chinese side's defense is tight, making it impossible to cross secretly, they had to use air power to kill and injure innocent civilians and destroy prosperous cities. Therefore, since the War of Resistance, Zheng and Luo have suffered the most air raids in the province, and the number of civilian casualties is the highest.

(2) The Situation of Bombing in Cities, Towns, and Villages: It has been found that since last year, the targets of Japanese aircraft bombing have gradually expanded from cities to remote villages. Taking Lin County, which has already fallen, as an example, it has been bombed a total of eleven times. Other examples include Huayuankou, Jingshui, and Dongzhao Village in Zheng County; Shahe and Jiezhong in Tanghe County; Wadian and Yuantan in Nanyang County; Yusi in Meng County; Zicheng and Shanhe Bailan in Jiyuan County; Jinjiaqiao in Tongbai County; Gu County, Ping氏 (unclear), Huiyu Town in Shan County; Guodi Town and Panlong Town in Guanxiang County; and Tiexie Baihe and other villages in Mengjin County, which have also been subjected to air raids. Taking Pingmin Town in Tongbai County as an example, on May 2nd of last year, eighteen Japanese aircraft arrived in batches, dropping 150 bombs, with flames spreading everywhere and people in panic. Although the above examples are not large-scale bombings, they demonstrate their tactics of disrupting local tranquility and harming innocent old, weak, women, and children.

B. The Following Is a Statistical List of Damages Suffered by Various Counties in Henan Province from the War of Resistance to the End of September Last Year:

### Securities: Foreign Debt Soars, Domestic Debt Steady

The securities black market yesterday showed a recovery after weakness. Bulls seemed to have a gradually growing sense of satisfaction. Large investors were seen more selling than buying, or buying and then reselling. After a long rise, a slight correction is a very reasonable trend. Yesterday morning, demand for No. 4 (Stock) at 35 and No. 58 remained high, and Da Feng also absorbed a considerable amount, but at the same time, sellers outnumbered buyers. United, United Profit, Sin Faith, Ruen Li, Da Tong, and Heng Fu either liquidated long positions or created new short positions, and their momentum was strong. The market price recovered after a period of weakness. Category C stock prices approached the 50-yuan mark. In the afternoon, No. 35 stock prices fluctuated inconsistently. Nos. 11 and 38 were still being sought after. There was demand for Ding Kang stock yesterday, with sellers mostly taking profits. Jiu Feng and Ju Xin also sold off their holdings, and the market price rose slightly again. Category C stocks again approached the 50-yuan mark, fluctuating within and outside the "Guan" (price level), but ultimately failing to break through the new high of 50 yuan and 3 jiao. The market may consolidate further, awaiting new catalysts. The market price ultimately closed slightly better by 5 fen and 1 jiao. The total transaction volume was approximately 1.2 million yuan. A summary table is provided below:

London, 9th - Today, Chinese foreign debt listed on the market continued to surge. The high-end Anglo-French and Consolidation (both issued in London) each rose by 5 pounds, with Anglo-French at 50 pounds and Consolidation at 45 pounds. Sino-French US dollar bonds rose by 3 pounds, to 51 pounds. The other three types each rose by 2 pounds, with Anglo-German (issued in London) at 60 pounds, Crisp loan at 30 pounds, and Fix at 12 pounds. Among the high-end railway bonds, the Beining, Longhai, and Guangzhou-Kowloon railways were flat, while the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway alone rose by 2 pounds, to 20 pounds. The others each rose by 1 pound, with Daocheng at 16 pounds, and Huguang non-German and German at 18 and 16 pounds respectively, and Jinpu both at 15 pounds.

It is said that the rise in foreign debt is related to peace and the stabilization of finance, according to reports from this city. However, peace is impossible given the current situation, and how to stabilize finance is not something that can be predicted in the short term. The rise in London foreign debt is ultimately somewhat related to current events, but the answer has not yet been revealed.

### HSBC Bank Dividend

Total of 5 pounds for the year, Yie Song distributes 24 yuan

### Stocks Frequently Rise

In stock trading, 40 shares of Qing Feng Textile Factory were traded yesterday at a price of 52 yuan, up more than 1 yuan from the previous day.

Yesterday, the stock market at the Public Brokers' Association opened very strong. The prices of all rubber stocks and most industrial stocks recovered much of what they had lost the previous day. Subsequently, as profit-taking re-emerged, the stocks suffered again. However, the decline soon stopped, and the market stabilized slightly. The underlying trend was firm. Shares of the Four Seas Insurance Company rose to 11 yuan, and shares of Yie Song Dockyard were traded at 235 yuan, which were the two major highlights in the industrial stock trading yesterday.

London, 9th - Today, the listed prices of British-owned Far East companies' stocks mostly rose and fell less. The Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Insurance shares rose 1 pound and 5 shillings, to 24 pounds and 15 shillings. HSBC Bank's UK-registered shares rose 2 and a half pounds, to 87 and a half pounds. Hong Kong-registered shares rose 3 pounds, to 90 pounds. Kulai Grampian Rubber shares fell 7 and a half pence, to 21 shillings and 10 and a half pence. The rest were flat.

### Finance: Speculation and Wait-and-See, Gold Market Neither Prosperous nor Disappointing

Yesterday's spot gold black market situation saw little change, with only small fluctuations. Trading decreased accordingly. However, a certain gold firm continued to sell off, while money changers occasionally absorbed from customers, resulting in a small decrease of two yuan. The morning opening price rose by ten yuan to four thousand and ninety yuan, due to tight foreign exchange rates and purchases by money changers. Subsequently, as the foreign exchange market suddenly loosened, a certain gold firm started to sell off, and a certain money changer also released holdings on behalf of many clients, resulting in a drop to a low price of four thousand and seventy-six yuan. However, at this time, the foreign exchange market suddenly tightened again, and securities firms took the opportunity to buy in, and at the same time, a certain bank also absorbed on behalf of its customers, which pushed the price up to a high of four thousand and ninety-four yuan. Subsequently, as foreign currencies returned to strength, many profit-takers came to sell off, and gold firms again sold off a certain amount, so the closing price at noon was only four thousand and eighty-two yuan. In the afternoon, the market became even quieter due to the lack of foreign exchange trading. Only the securities firms made a few further sales, slightly suppressing the price. The closing price was four thousand and seventy-eight yuan. The total trading volume for the day was only about a thousand taels. Jewelry gold at gold shops remained stable, and customs duties also remained stable.

Spot Gold Down Another Two Yuan

Since the market opened in the morning, with tight foreign exchange rates, a certain money changer took the lead in raising prices to buy in, and the opening price rose by ten yuan. The money changer bought 30 taels from the gold shop at four thousand and ninety yuan. Shortly afterwards, the foreign exchange rate suddenly showed signs of easing, and market sentiment deteriorated. A certain gold firm immediately started to sell, and another money changer also sold off a lot. Most buyers were on the sidelines. Before long, the price fell by 14 yuan. The money changer sold 20 taels to the gold shop at four thousand and seventy-six yuan. Then, with the securities firms seeing a bargain and buying in, and the foreign exchange market showing signs of softening again, coupled with a certain money changer and a certain bank also buying in on behalf of their customers, the price gradually rose by eighteen yuan. The securities firm bought 10 taels from the gold firm at four thousand and ninety-four yuan. After that, the foreign exchange rate returned to its previous level, and the securities firms took the opportunity to sell at a high price, and a certain gold firm also sold off again, so the price gradually declined. The money changer sold 20 taels to the gold shop at four thousand and eighty yuan. Then, the money changers traded 20 taels among themselves at four thousand and eighty-two yuan as the noon closing price. The trend in the afternoon was flat and weak. First, the money changers traded 10 taels among themselves at four thousand and eighty-one yuan, down one yuan from the noon closing price. Later, at half past two, the securities firms came to sell again, bringing the price down another three yuan. The securities firm sold 20 taels to the money changer at four thousand and seventy-eight yuan as the evening closing price. As a result, the price continued to fall by two yuan compared with the previous day. The price fluctuated by 18 yuan throughout the day. The selling price of gold from cash gold shops was a few yuan higher than the spot gold price, and the buying price was 20 yuan lower. The margin gold price was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price, and there was little trading.

Jewelry Gold Unchanged All Day

The selling price of jewelry gold per tael has not changed. Datongxing still quoted 410 yuan, and the price of new firms was the same as the previous price. The buying price was about 15 yuan lower.

Recent Gold Prices in Ningbo

Since the National Government announced the gold and silver regulations, the Ningbo jewelry industry has stopped issuing gold jewelry. People who want jewelry can only exchange for silver items. At present, Ningbo jewelry stores such as Tianbaocheng, Fangzicheng, and Xinfengxiang have all established "Central Bank Gold Collection Agency" outlets to collect gold at the listed price. Although the price per tael is 360 yuan, the black market price has already reached 380 or 390 yuan. People believe that the prices are similar to those in Shanghai, and it is too dangerous to bring jewelry to Shanghai, because the export of gold jewelry is limited to one Shanghai tael. Therefore, they all exchange in Ningbo. (Tao)

### Foreign Exchange Fluctuates Within a Narrow Range

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no changes in HSBC's listed prices. The black market prices of British and American exchange rates fluctuated within a narrow range, showing a slight tightening trend in the calm market. However, the end result was neither particularly good nor bad. At the beginning of the morning, the continued rise in American and British exchange rates caused the market to show a tight British and flat American trend, with prices at 4 pence 859375 and 8 yuan. Subsequently, the Mitsui Bank of Japan took the lead in buying, and because the supply from foreign banks was very weak, the prices tightened sharply to 4 pence 8125 and 7 yuan 90625. Later, due to a sudden sell-off from Hong Kong and the fact that Sassoon, exporters, and Shanghai Chinese firms were also releasing spot goods to each other, and it was also heard that HSBC was also selling, the prices once turned firmer, with the American exchange rate breaking the 8-yuan mark, reaching 8 yuan and 3125. The British pound also rose to 4 pence 875. However, due to foreign firms buying distant-month American exchange rates at low prices, and Chinese merchants also slightly following suit, the prices tightened again, shrinking to 4 pence 84375 and 7 yuan 9375. Later, buyers were satisfied, and American banks, Datong and other banks still had ample supply, so the market returned to flatness. Until the closing, it was similar to the morning opening. As a result, the British exchange rate tightened by 0.015625, while the American exchange rate showed no difference. The underlying trend of futures was no different from that of spot prices.

Sassoon Sells British and American Exchange

At the beginning of the morning, London telegraphs reported gains of 0.0625 for both near and far months, while New York silver prices remained flat, London spot gold remained unchanged, the exchange rate of the British pound against the US dollar rose by half a point, the exchange rate against Shanghai rose by 0.125, and the exchange rate against France rose by 50 centimes. The exchange rate of the US dollar against the British pound rose by 0.0875, the exchange rate against Shanghai remained unchanged, and the exchange rate against France rose by 0.0625. The central government's listed prices remained the same. The bank's opening spot selling prices were 4 pence 859375 for the British pound and 8 yuan for the American dollar, which was 0.015625 tighter for the British pound and flat for the American dollar compared to the previous day, due to the continued rise in exchange rates. After the opening, Mitsui took the lead in buying, and the supply from foreign banks was very weak, so the market situation suddenly weakened. At 9:15, the British pound had shrunk to 4 pence 8125, and the American dollar had tightened to 7 yuan 90625. Fortunately, a sell-off from Hong Kong came in time, and soon Sassoon and exporters also released spot British and American exchange rates, and Shanghai Chinese firms also sold spot American exchange rates, and it was also heard that HSBC was also selling at that time, so the position suddenly felt abundant, and the situation gradually eased. When HSBC's listed prices were announced, they did not move, and the silver equalization tax was announced to be up by half a point. After this, until 9:39, the British pound had returned to 4 pence 875, and the American dollar had also returned to 8 yuan 03135. Later, due to foreign firms buying in at low prices, and Chinese merchants also slightly following suit, the sellers gradually decreased, and the trend showed a slight tightening again. At 10:15, the British pound reached 4 pence 84375, and the American dollar reached 7 yuan 9375. Then, with fewer buyers and American banks such as Datong still having a good supply, the market soon returned to flatness. After this, the buying and selling wait-and-see trend became stable. Until the closing, the bank's spot selling prices were 4 pence 859275 for the British pound and 8 yuan for the American dollar. This month's British pound was 4 pence 84375, and the American dollar was 7 yuan 9685. As a result, the current and futures British pounds both tightened by 0.015625 compared to the previous day, while the American dollar did not show any gains or losses. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon.

Hong Kong Shanghai Exchange Rate Rises by Four Yuan

Hong Kong, 10th - This morning, the foreign exchange market opened steadily. The spot British exchange rate remained unchanged, and the forward rate loosened by 0.03125, to 1 shilling, 2 pence and 90625. The spot American exchange rate loosened by 0.0625, to 24 yuan 5625. The spot Shanghai exchange rate rose by three yuan, to 304 yuan. The spot Japanese exchange rate loosened slightly by 0.025, to 103 yuan 75.

Tianjin British and American Currencies Both Contract

Tianjin, 10th - The foreign exchange market was sluggish at the opening this morning. The spot British exchange rate tightened by 0.021875, to 4 pence 0625. The spot American exchange rate contracted by 0.03125, to 7 yuan 625. The Shanghai exchange rate rose by two yuan, to 304 yuan. The "Joint Currency" black market continued to rise by 0.5 yuan, to 96 yuan 0.5 yuan.

### Foreign Currencies Fluctuate with Softness

Yesterday, foreign currencies moved within a narrower range and tended to fluctuate. Supply and demand for British and American gold pounds were scarce, and the market was stable. The supply of gold certificates was relatively abundant midway, and as a result, the American yuan certificates saw no gains or losses, and the evening price was still 12 yuan 6 jiao. British gold certificates rose slightly, mainly due to the strength of the pound price. Demand for Hong Kong notes was slightly strong, and the market was slightly firm. Absorption of French francs, Singapore dollars, Dutch guilders, and Annam piasters was not strong, and the market was soft. The supply of "Kantou" (Cantonese) notes increased, and the market price was slightly lower. The supply and demand for Japanese gold certificates were balanced, and the market fluctuated with softness. The evening price was 1 yuan, 6 fen and 4 li. The supply of Korean notes increased, and the market was weak. The evening price was 1 yuan and 5 fen. Yesterday's market prices saw British gold certificates rise by 1 jiao, Hong Kong notes rise by 1 fen, French franc notes fall by 2 li, Singapore notes fall by 2 jiao, Dutch notes fall by 1 jiao, Annam notes fall by 7 fen, Kantou notes fall by 5 fen, and the prices of other currencies remained unchanged.

### Grains: Saigon Rice Prices Slightly Looser, Japonica Tip Rice Fluctuation Very Small

After the japonica tip rice market rose again, the opening trend continued to be tight. General merchants and traders were still unwilling to sell easily, and the bidding prices were quite high. If foreign rice is still the main source, No. 1 Saigon rice once reached 37 yuan, and No. 2 Saigon rice also reached 35 yuan and 8 jiao. Other early and late rice also opened at over 37 yuan, but local shops became slack as soon as they moved, and dared not buy in too much. Because the rice-selling business from public sources will soon begin, there are bound to be many effects due to various reasons. As a result, the trend suddenly turned dull at noon, and there were few inquiries in both retail and wholesale markets, so the market was difficult to maintain and showed weakness. Although the sources from various places were still scarce, it was ultimately difficult to reverse market sentiment. The actual selling price of No. 1 Saigon rice was 36 yuan and a half, No. 2 Saigon rice was 25 yuan and 3 jiao, and early and late rice was 37 yuan. The market fluctuated by only 1 or 2 jiao throughout the day.

The source of foreign rice is continuous. In addition to the continuous shipping from Hong Kong, Saigon orders are also being shipped one after another. Yesterday's telegraph reported that foreign prices were slightly looser. There were many batches of No. 1 and broken rice under negotiation. Most are still awaiting confirmation. Yesterday, only 200 tons of No. 1 Saigon rice were agreed upon, with a price of 42 yuan and a half. The intention to sell the original return packages was slightly looser. Yesterday's market had already reached 44 yuan. Spot goods have been blocked from being shipped out, market sentiment has returned to stability, and the market has also rebounded by 5 or 6 jiao. Saigon opened at 36 yuan and 7 jiao, broken rice at 32 yuan and 8 jiao, Tokyo rice at 33 yuan 1 and 2 jiao, and secondary grades were priced accordingly. The market had not seen a large squeeze for a long time, and yesterday it also sold out at 32 yuan and 8 jiao.

Another report: It was previously reported that a certain French steamer brought a large batch of foreign rice from Saigon. It has now been confirmed that it is the "Adous" of the French Fire Wheel Company, which carried a total of 28,200 bags, and is expected to be imported this morning and docked at the Gonghexiang Wharf in Hongkou for unloading.

### Flour is Firm ——Wheat Also Rises——

Flour: Since the factory prices have risen to 9 yuan and jiao, the price of wheat has also become expensive, reaching over 16 yuan. Moreover, due to the extreme shortage of ship space for foreign wheat, only one ship ordered by Fufeng Factory has been confirmed. The rest have not been properly delivered, so market sentiment is even more optimistic. Except for supplying their own sales, the factories are unwilling to sell to outside traders, because the difference between the factory price and the trader price was as much as half a yuan in the previous two days. At present, the factory price has increased by 4 jiao, and the trader price must also be increased accordingly, resulting in the invisible stagnation of trader sales. Altogether, only this company, Heng and traders from the interior transacted a total of 15,000 to 16,000 bags. It is reported that the return goods' "Green Cannon Car" is close to the upper yuan mark, but there has been no formal transaction. The flour from the Japanese factories has gradually improved, and speculators are flocking to it. The price of Phoenix brand in January is 9 yuan 6 jiao to 6 jiao half. There are many buyers in February, and it is close to the 10 yuan mark.

Wheat: The market was also firm yesterday. Since the factory's purchase price reached the 10-yuan mark, market sentiment was excited. Market hoarders did not mind the high prices and secretly absorbed them. Most of them were sold to Japanese factories, and the price was 2 to 3 jiao higher than the normal price. Therefore, the purchase price of Chinese factories had to be driven up by the Japanese factories. Yesterday, the goods' side planned to raise the price again, but the factories did not accept it. As a result, Fufeng and Fuxin factories bought one car of ordinary wheat each, and the price was still yuan.

### Miscellaneous Grains: Soybean Sales Market Lively

The price of soybeans continued to rise by 2 or 3 jiao, and the overall situation was supported by the sales market. Therefore, the underlying trend was firm. Yesterday, Nanyang and local street warehouses and oil factories all inquired. According to statistics, 6 or 7 cars of Dingjiazhou beans were traded at a price of 18 yuan 8 jiao to 5 jiao, and high-quality beans were 19 yuan. Four cars of Wuhu beans were traded at a price of 18 yuan 4 jiao to 18 yuan 1 jiao. More than 2,000 bags of Nanjing beans were traded at a price of 18 yuan 3 jiao to 17 yuan 9 jiao and a half. Three cars of Liuhe beans were traded at a price of 7 yuan 8 jiao. More than 400 bags of Jiangbei beans were traded at a price of 17 yuan 6 jiao and a half. More than 200 bags of Taicang beans were traded at a price of 18 yuan 3 jiao, and more than 200 bags of Pinghu Doudou beans were traded at a price of 21 yuan 2 jiao to 20 yuan 02 jiao. More than 100 bags of Chongming sand yellow beans were traded at a price of 18 yuan 6 jiao to 2 jiao. In addition, 350 bags of beans came from Beisha yesterday.

### Yarn and Cotton: It is Difficult to Expect the Yarn Market to Revive

The yarn market is calm, but the trend is still weak and listless. Although Northern traders purchase for domestic sales of yarn, they are all 10-count coarse yarn. The sales of 20-count yarn is particularly slow, so market sentiment is still difficult to revive. Moreover, the 20-count Double Horse factory's shipment of 5,600 bags due in January has already arrived, and it is necessary to advance money to ship the goods. In this regard, a batch of chips has been added to the market, so although the bulls are tightening and not letting go, some have the idea of shorting distant-month yarn. Therefore, the competition between the two sides is particularly fierce, and it is unknown who will win.

At the opening of the spot yarn market this morning, it was heard that foreign exchange had shrunk slightly, and the atmosphere in the market was slightly strong. The opening price of 20-count Double Horse yarn was 726 yuan, but buyers were not enthusiastic, and the market situation was increasingly hesitant. After a while, it fell slightly to 723 yuan. Soon, as the bulls came to buy in again, it rose again by several yuan to 727 yuan, but the transaction was not strong. It was found that 1,955 bags were traded in half a day, and the price of 20-count Double Horse yarn rose by 5 jiao. The rest were about the same as the previous day. The amount of buying and selling by each party is as follows:

Same trade 1,090, Tianjin 535, Ningbo 45, Hong Kong 70, Inland 215, Total 1,955

Cotton Only Traded Among Peers

The transaction of local cotton is still improving, but it is all among peers buying and selling each other. Because the factories have difficulty seeing the price of yarn rise and have even seen it fall, they have not done anything about the bales. In addition, the overseas cotton market is also in a fluctuating trend, and the foreign exchange trend is loosening, so market sentiment is firm but with some softness. As for the source of cotton from northern Jiangsu, there are 1,567 bales of Tonghua (ordinary cotton), 1,590 bales of Changyinsha cotton, and 686 bales from Beisha. The current cotton transaction situation is recorded on the left: Fireweed bale, 163.50, Same trade buys in 230 bales. Great Zhongji, 215.00, also 170 pieces, also 214.00, also 274 pieces. Firewood frame, 166.00, also 140 pieces. South Thai, 164.75, also 58 bales. Great Zhongji, 222.25, also 194 pieces. Fire engine, 162.50, also 320 bales. Tongzhou, 175.50, also 180 bales. Lower sand America, 186.00, also 98 bales. Sand mixed ocean, 178.00, also 140 bales. Sanyu flower, 194.50, also 180 bales. Great Zhongji, 114.45, also 201 bales.

Another report on the market price of foreign cotton: The New York cotton market was weaker yesterday due to the pressure of mass selling and overseas merchants' selling, but it was still relatively firm. As a result, the closing price fell by 5 or 6 points compared with the previous day, and the distant month fell by 9 points. Indian cotton, including forecasts, rose by more than one rupee. Egyptian cotton fell by 3.5 pounds. Liverpool fell by 10 pence.

Trading of foreign cotton in Shanghai is very quiet. It has been very dull in recent days. All parties are uncertain about the foreign exchange rate, not knowing whether it will be loose or tight. Due to the cumbersome procedures of spot trading among peers, it is easier to buy New York distant-month cotton, so many have switched to this industry. The factory price with a 美匯 rate of 8 yuan is as follows: 20-count US cotton, Mitchell, 228.85, also lower grade, 224.70; 32-count, 240.00, also lower grade, 222.00; 42-count, 245.00, also lower grade, 237.7.

### Sugar Market: Coarse White Gradually Loosening

Yesterday, the sugar market saw a downstream trend. The association's price for spot 24 coarse white was 56 yuan and a half at the local warehouse, down one yuan. The price of newly arrived imported sugar at other warehouses dropped by nearly a yuan to several jiao, to 57 yuan to 56 yuan and 8 jiao. Old goods were 56 yuan and 2 jiao. Transshipment goods were down 5 jiao, to 45 yuan and a half. Taikoo refined white sugar was slightly looser. Eastern warehouse B mark was 58 yuan and a half, western warehouse was 58 yuan and 8 jiao, CW mark was 58 yuan and a half, CX mark was yuan 18 yuan 3 jiao, DY mark was 58 yuan, and HX Ka was 57 yuan and a half. The H mark coarse sugar also fell by half a yuan, to 42 yuan and a half. Dutch coarse sugar was 45 yuan. Mumian white sugar was down one yuan, Zhenji No. 1 was 56 yuan and a half, No. 1 was 56 yuan, local No. 1 bingtang (rock sugar) was 67 yuan and a half, and Jingming bingtang was 69 yuan. The price of the 50 bags of Huizhou secondary white sugar opened by the domestic sugar mill was 51 yuan and 8 jiao to 52 yuan. Although the price of Diaoqing was called 46 yuan, the traders were on the sidelines and did not buy. Today, 2,000 bags of sugar are being shipped to Ningbo.

### Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth Ostensibly Loose, Actually Tight

The Nanyang Route is Still the Most Prosperous

The cloth market was firm yesterday. Trader routes and overseas actual demand were sustained. Although the foreign exchange market was fluctuating, the hoarders' attitude was hesitant. The market showed an ostensibly loose but actually tight situation, with fluctuations of slightly one or two jiao. Shenxin Fugui fine cloth once fell to 22 yuan, but then rebounded to 22 yuan 2 jiao half to five jiao. The selling prices of Jardine Matheson and Linchang of British firms were the most attractive, because most of the products from the two factories are now directly sold overseas. The Zhejiang and Jiangxi traders also ordered by brand, with the Zhejiang and Jiangxi traders buying more than 200 pieces of coarse cloth and bleached cloth yesterday. The Hong Kong and Nanyang traders bought more than 10,000 pieces of fine twill, satin, colored cloth, and bleached cloth. The local street traded more than 300 pieces of coarse cloth, fine cloth, twill poplin, and bleached cloth. The Tianjin traders bought more than 100 pieces of coarse twill, blue cloth, and poplin. In addition, there are 560 pieces of cloth being shipped to Ningbo today.

### The Unveiling of Human Body Secrets: Where Does the Omnipotence of Intelligence Come From? Now There's a Method for Love and Happiness!

— By American Medical Doctor Yao Chong, Specialist in Venereal Diseases, and Physician Zhan Nianhe

(Clinic) 2nd Floor, China Trust Company, Intersection of Beijing Road and Sichuan Road (Time) 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM, Closed on Sundays

Recently, some people are surprised by the discovery of the secrets of human reproductive function! In fact, there are people who have studied this deeply and contributed great inventions to humankind. Anyone who has read physiology or zoology knows that our bodies, in addition to skin, bones, blood, and flesh, also have something more precious; namely, nerves and endocrine secretions within the reproductive glands. The nervous system includes various types such as sensory, transmitting, cerebrum, cerebellum, spinal cord, and sexual nerves, all composed of nerve cells that are connected to each other. Therefore, the nervous system is like a network, densely distributed throughout the body, specializing in the functions of sensation and response. But the nervous system relies on nourishment, which is the endocrine fluid of the reproductive glands.

Reproductive gland endocrine secretions are a type of ductless gland. They are the sum of the pituitary gland, pineal gland, adrenal and adrenal glands, testicular glands, etc. During the period of spring arousal, these glands are particularly developed, so intelligence suddenly opens up, the body develops, the face shows rosy color, and the voice is loud… Therefore, this type of gland not only presides over reproductive function, but also assists in development, nourishes nerves, adjusts metabolism, and enhances resistance; especially when stimulated by certain special environments, it can excite nerves, concentrate the mind, exert extraordinary talents and abilities, and become a very intelligent person. The emotions of joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness, expressed outwardly, become passionate, righteous, and literary individuals! Intelligence is the most essential thing for us humans. In the past, during the Chu-Han contention, Xiang Yu and Liu Bang fought to the death. At that time, Liu Bang's military strength was inferior to Xiang Yu's, so he replied to Xiang Yu: "I do not want to fight with you in strength, but I want to fight with you in intelligence." As a result, Liu Bang eventually established the Han dynasty. This clear fact in history shows that intelligence is indeed omnipotent.

Since the interaction and importance of reproductive gland endocrine secretions and the nervous system are so significant, men must cherish themselves and strive to maintain their health. In the unfortunate event of early ignorance and curiosity, committing masturbation, nocturnal emission, early marriage and indulgence, or excessive worry and stimulation, which damages the nervous system or depletes the endocrine fluid of the reproductive glands, then symptoms such as brain weakness and forgetfulness, insomnia and palpitations, back pain, kidney failure and impotence, premature ejaculation, incomplete development, and infertility will be numerous. Such weak men not only face a bleak future due to their declining energy, but also in the arena of love, or in the sexual life between husband and wife, they will inevitably be abandoned by women and hated by wives and concubines, falling into the most tragic situation in the human world!

The only method for treatment and prevention is to quickly take the "Reproductin," a preparation made from the hormones of healthy animal reproductive glands, as it is the most effective remedy for these conditions. This remedy, since its invention by Professor Stenah, a master of physiology and medicine in Germany, after a lifetime of arduous experiments, has shocked the medical community around the world, as it is believed to be a new method for preventing disease, prolonging life, and rejuvenating oneself. When I was studying effective treatments for venereal diseases in the United States, I also used this remedy for continuous experiments. Among thousands of venereal disease patients, more than 90% who took this remedy recovered completely. The recorded efficacy of this remedy is unmatched by any other. It is indeed because of its precious ingredients, excellent manufacturing, reliable efficacy, and great restorative power that it surpasses any similar preparation. Taking it will generate semen and tonify the kidneys, strengthen the brain and activate blood circulation within one day and night. It is especially valuable to take it continuously, as it further promotes development, nourishes semen and blood, nourishes nerves, and regulates metabolism. The aforementioned symptoms will surely be cured in a short period. Regular consumption by middle-aged and elderly people will prolong life and rejuvenate oneself. However, those suffering from nocturnal emission must also take the effective remedy for nocturnal emission, "Hemitol's Semen-Consolidating Tablets" (available at major Chinese and Western pharmacies such as China-West Five Continents Hua Mei and Sino-British, priced at two yuan per box), to stop leakage, which will be even more effective.

Beautification

### A New Method for Breast Development

— American Medical Doctor Yao Chongpei

Methods for female beautification are almost more strenuous than those for men, because women have special physiological characteristics, such as menstruation and pregnancy. Therefore, for a woman to achieve the standard of beauty, she must follow the following methods to maintain it for a long time. According to the research of the world's most famous beauty experts and gynecologists, Dr. Wei Niji of France and Dr. Eli Faks of the American Baxter Hospital, and Director Lu Xing, the success of female beauty must have high and prominent breast beauty, and plump and graceful buttocks beauty, in addition to the posture when walking. However, the above conditions must be based on health, especially if the female body's youth glands are not healthy, then the breasts will be atrophied, menstruation will be disordered, muscles will be thin, curves will be lost, and even after marriage, it will be difficult to bear children. Even if pregnancy occurs, healthy children will not be produced. Therefore, those who seek beauty, if they encounter such misfortunes, should quickly take the ovarian endocrine preparation for women, "Reproductin," to make the youth glands and ovarian function develop and flourish, so that metabolism is vigorous, menstruation is naturally accurate, breasts are high and prominent, buttocks are plump, curves are clear, and at the same time, the face must be delicate and charming, the muscles are smooth, the subcutaneous fat is full, and everything is full of the active posture of "beauty," worthy of being an advanced woman of the times.

Example: A female employee of a famous department store in this city, due to physical weakness and insufficient secretion of the reproductive glands (i.e., youth glands) and ovaries, had atrophied breasts, thin buttocks, and a haggard face. Later, through the introduction of a relative in the Western medicine department, she took "Reproductin" for women for less than two months, and her appearance was completely different. Not only did her breasts suddenly become high and prominent, firm and elastic, but also her long-standing menstrual irregularities were completely cured. Her complexion became rosy, and her skin was crystal clear. Those who saw her were amazed and praised her beauty.

### Untreated Nocturnal Emission is Like a Fire

— Specialist in Venereal Diseases, Physician Zhan Nianceng

A single spark can start a prairie fire, and everyone knows that this is dangerous. Unfortunately, if a young person, due to ignorance and curiosity, commits masturbation or indulgence, or due to worry and labor, damages the sexual nerves and loosens the seminal vesicle, then a terrible nocturnal emission will surely erupt. Although in the beginning, the frequency of nocturnal emission is still low, and there is no pain or itching, it seems insignificant, but over time, if drips are not stopped, they will form rivers and seas. How many young people have turned mild nocturnal emissions into dangerous spermatorrhea due to lack of treatment; and how many men have suffered great physical losses due to untreated nocturnal emission, suffering from brain weakness and forgetfulness, insomnia and palpitations, back pain, kidney failure and premature ejaculation, incomplete development, and infertility. Such men will inevitably be sluggish in energy, unsightly in appearance, unable to advance in studies, and unable to succeed in their careers, despised by women, hated by wives and concubines, and fall into the miserable situation of losing education, losing jobs, losing love, and losing happiness; or even because their bodies have no stored essence, just like machines lacking oil, they will prematurely age and die young.

Treating nocturnal emission is like fighting a fire! Firefighting should be swift and thorough, and so should the treatment of nocturnal emission! According to the years of experience of famous doctors at home and abroad and ourselves, taking the effective remedy for nocturnal emission, "Hemitol's Semen-Consolidating Tablets," is the fastest and most thorough method, because this remedy can indeed consolidate the seminal vesicle and calm the nerves. After taking it, it can achieve the miraculous effect of sleep and stopping nocturnal emission on the same night. After taking it continuously for two weeks, it is guaranteed to be completely eradicated. However, those whose bodies have been depleted and have one or more of the aforementioned symptoms must also take the "Reproductin," a preparation made from the hormones of healthy animal reproductive glands, which will generate semen and tonify the kidneys, strengthen the brain and replenish blood, assist development, and nourish semen and blood within 24 hours after taking it. Taking it continuously for one month guarantees that all diseases will suddenly disappear and energy will be doubled. Regular consumption by middle-aged and elderly people will prolong life and rejuvenate oneself. If patients can come to the clinic in person for new therapies such as electrotherapy and injections, the effect will be even faster!

### The Chinese Army Achieves Successive Victories on Two Routes; Landmines Explode Under Shanghai-Hangzhou Passenger Trains; More Than Ten Passenger Trains Destroyed with Heavy Casualties; Japanese Automobiles in Suzhou Attacked by the Chinese Army

According to people from Tianhang, the Chinese army in the suburbs has been exceptionally active recently, so gunshots have been heard frequently in the vicinity, and residents are panicked. Recently, a large number of security soldiers stationed in Hangzhou secretly crossed the Qiantang River to surrender. The Chinese army authorities not only reassured them but also rewarded them. Recently, the Japanese have been fleeing in droves, so it is rumored that troops have been dispatched to guard the area. It is also reported that the Japanese stationed on the north bank of the Qiantang River are not only buying from the south bank but also proclaiming that they will attack Shaoxing and other places in the near future. The Chinese army authorities, in addition to preparing to defend themselves, are also preparing for a bold attack on the provincial capital.

Beijing-Shanghai Areas

Japanese Suffer Heavy Losses

Also according to people from Suzhou, in the past half month, the Chinese army in the Beijing-Shanghai area has been active again. All Japanese troops in the area are panicking, especially in Suzhou and Changzhou. It is rumored that yesterday (the 10th) morning, a Japanese military vehicle traveling from Beijing to Suzhou was attacked by the Chinese army in the area near Suzhou. It is also learned that the Chinese army near Jintan attacked the Japanese military headquarters the night before (the 8th), inflicting heavy losses on the Japanese. The New Fourth Army in the suburbs of Nanjing has also been quite active recently. In addition to repeatedly attacking the Japanese army, they have also warned residents to quickly move out to minimize casualties during the general counterattack.

Shanghai-Hangzhou Passenger Trains

Landmines Detonate in Wangdian

The 108th Division of the Chinese Army in the Shanghai-Hangzhou area was ordered to move out a few days ago and laid landmines near Jiaxing and Wangdian. The next day, a passenger train from Hangzhou to Shanghai detonated the landmines. About 60 Japanese soldiers were killed or injured in the train, and many passengers were also killed or injured. It is reported that the injured were immediately sent to the "Jiaxing Hospital," and the dead were buried on the spot. It is reported that after the incident, the Japanese army in Wangdian not only searched the area extensively but also forced nearby shop residents to repair the road for about two hours before it was over. All uninjured passengers were transported to Shanghai on vehicles sent from Hangzhou.

No Banditry in Ganyaol Area

The Ganyaol People's National Salvation Army is quite ambitious. Since Mr. Gu personally reorganized it, its strength has become even greater. It is reported that in addition to repeatedly defeating the Japanese army, Mr. Gu's troops are concerned that bandits may take the opportunity to run rampant as winter approaches, so he has ordered his subordinates to strictly apprehend them. Anyone captured will be punished severely by Mr. Gu without exception. Therefore, there is no banditry in Ganyaol, Youchegang, Nanhui, Darenzhuang, and other places under the jurisdiction of Mr. Gu.

### The Yue-Gui New Road

With the loss of Ningming County in Guangxi Province, the Yue-Gui transportation was suddenly interrupted, and various cargo transportation companies felt quite inconvenienced. The only thing that could be relied upon to communicate was the Zhenyue Railway. However, goods stored in Haiphong could not be cleared out for a while, and new goods could not be transported. Passenger transportation was also quite crowded. The Chinese and Vietnamese authorities, concerned about this, planned to open a new road to communicate. Recently, a new road connecting Vietnam and Guangxi Province has been completed. Its starting point is Gaoping in Vietnam, passing through Jingxi, Dabao, Tiandong, Tianyang, Donglan, and Chehe in Guangxi Province, and reaching Liuzhai, connecting with the Yue-Gui Highway. From there, it is convenient to go to Guiyang, Chongqing, and other places.

### Background of the Phillips Case: A Rumor Circulates That the Goal Was to Halt Negotiations on Cross-Boundary Road Construction, Allegedly to Show That the "Mayor" of Chuan Xiao'an Had Suffered a Political Failure

The English-language "Ta Mei Evening Post" reported that, according to news from the "Badlands," the underlying cause of the assassination attempt on Phillips, the chief executive and director-general of the Shanghai Municipal Council, on Saturday morning on Haig Road, was a power struggle for the position of mayor of Shanghai. It was alleged that certain people within a faction were eager to obtain the position of "mayor" of Shanghai and therefore planned to assassinate Phillips in order to halt the negotiations led by Chuan Xiao'an, the "mayor" appointed by the Japanese side, regarding the issue of cross-boundary road construction. According to this faction, if Chuan succeeded in the negotiations, it would greatly reduce their chances of ascending to the position. It was reported that those who planned this conspiracy also intended to have the assailants flee into the "Badlands" after committing the crime, and then spread rumors that the case was the work of people sent by Chongqing. However, the three assailants were unexpectedly captured by the bodyguards of the New New Casino, and their meticulously planned conspiracy failed.

### Flat-Price Rice Relief Measures Prepared; Authorities to Assist in Protection; More Than 28,000 Bags of Gongshan Rice Imported This Morning; Free Rice Porridge Distribution Changed to New Dagulu

The Shanghai Flat-Price Rice Relief Committee sent a letter to the chief executive of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession and the director-general of the Shanghai French Concession, stating, "Respected Sirs, recently, rice prices in this city have skyrocketed, making life difficult for the people, and the poor who live day to day have found themselves in dire straits. If relief is not provided, the future is unimaginable. We have been concerned about providing assistance and have invited representatives from various commercial societies and national organizations, as well as enthusiastic individuals from all walks of life, to organize the Shanghai Flat-Price Rice Relief Committee to raise funds for flat-price rice relief and handle flat-price rice relief matters. It has been agreed that starting from the 18th of this month, within the two concessions, one hundred rice shops will be entrusted to issue tickets at fifty shops and distribute rice at fifty shops to begin operations, with the intention of distributing to sixty shops in the Public Concession and forty shops in the French Concession to achieve widespread coverage. We respectfully send this letter and request that Your Excellency the Chief Executive provide assistance and protect your subordinates, and extend our friendly greetings."

Foreign Rice Arrives in Shanghai

The continuous arrival of foreign rice in Shanghai has been reported in previous newspapers. It is now learned that another large batch of approximately 28,200 bags of Gongyou rice, loaded from Saigon on the French mail ship "Adomos First," is scheduled to be imported this morning. The ship is scheduled to dock at the Gonghexiang Wharf in Hongkou. The foreign rice will also be temporarily stored in the Gonghexiang warehouse.

Consultations on Flat-Price Relief

After the Rice Shop Trade Association resolved to accept the Flat-Price Rice Relief Committee's delegation to handle flat-price relief, it has designated one hundred member rice shops in the two concessions to handle the matter. It has now dispatched personnel to solicit the consent of each member and will soon convene a meeting to handle the procedures, with the intention of implementing it from January 18th. The first round of flat-price rice relief involves 16,000 bags of broken rice purchased by the Flat-Price Rice Relief Committee in Shanghai, and it is stipulated that each shop will distribute 50 bags of flat-price rice per day, with the intention of distributing them within one week. After 15,000 bags ordered from Saigon arrive, the distribution will continue.

Free Rice Porridge and Mantou

The Shanghai Charity Federation, in view of the current high prices of everything in the city and the difficulty for the poor to make a living, especially those who are freezing and starving, which are more numerous than in previous years, advanced its schedule to distribute free rice porridge and mantou (steamed buns) in the New Dagulu area starting at 7:00 PM the night before (the 9th). Yesterday, the poor who heard the news flocked to receive the free aid and were quite crowded, totaling more than eight hundred. Eight bags of flour were distributed, making more than two thousand mantou, each weighing four taels, and three large wooden barrels of hot rice porridge. In view of the large number of poor people waiting for aid, the flour was specially increased to fourteen bags last night, making a total of more than five thousand mantou. The poor waiting for aid were mostly workers and rickshaw pullers. After receiving the mantou and rice porridge, they all smiled happily. The original location for the distribution the night before was in the Longmenlu area, but due to the inconvenience caused by the Lei trolley, it was changed to the middle section of New Dagulu for distribution. The federation dispatched Mr. Lu Deshen, Mr. Cheng Tongsheng, and Mr. Wang Limin to take care of the scene. Chief Zhang Wenjun of the Chengdu Road Police Station, leading Chinese and Western detectives, was responsible for maintaining order, and the process went quite well.

Aid Distribution Method

The aid distribution work continued last night and will end at the end of the old lunar year. As for the amount distributed, it is currently stipulated that each person can receive two mantou and a bowl of hot rice porridge. However, last night, because many people brought cups and pots, the order was slightly chaotic. The federation has now posted a notice stating that each resident waiting for aid must bring a cup or bowl to collect the hot rice porridge to maintain order.

The Situation of Distributing Free Mantou on New Dagulu

### Japanese Currency and Japanese Military Scrip Can Now Be Used to Purchase Stamps; Effective January 15th; One Japanese Yen Equals 1.25 Legal Tender Yuan

### Integrity and Shame Committee Telegraphed Wang Jingwei to Abandon His Position

The various circles Integrity and Shame Movement Committee in this city used the Tokyo telegraph to report that the Wang-Japan treaty actually handed over the new political power in the Northeast and allowed Japan to station troops in North China and Inner Mongolia. The four-day "pseudo" signed an anti-communist alliance, and the two sides jointly invested in the development of China's rich resources. It specially telegraphed Wang to abandon his position.

The post of Consul-General will be succeeded by Sir George. Sir George will take office after Sir Qing leaves Shanghai.

### Rumor that the Pseudo-Army in the Nanshi Area Was Suddenly Disarmed

A few days ago, pseudo-army suddenly stationed at the Guandi Temple on Zhaojiabang Road in the old Ximen area of Nanshi, strictly resembling a military institution. Unexpectedly, from 5:00 AM on the 9th to 6:00 AM on the 10th, Jun Ning soldiers stationed in Nanshi and Chongdao Zhengichi, the Nanshi squad leader of the Shanghai Special Affairs Agency, Saito, the Japanese instructor of the Nanshi Police Sub-bureau, and others supervised more than 30 fully armed Japanese soldiers of the Nanshi Garrison Force, drove many cars and military trucks, established a cordon and surrounded the area, and copied and detained more than 200 people in all uniforms and documents, and more than 500 rifles, loaded them onto trucks, and drove them to the original site of the former Municipal Police Bureau on Penglai Road to temporarily detain the Japanese Nanshi Ningbing branch. At the same time, there were also so-called branch troops of a certain army's presidential branch in Jingjiang Guild Hall outside the old Ximen Gate, and a certain surname garden house next to the Chen Yingchishi Memorial Tower, Jiangxi Guild Hall on Dongjiadu Xiaoputuo Bridge, Catholic Church, and Merchant Guild Hall on Guild Hall Street, but there were only a few people listening and guarding the door, and they were also detained. As for the inside story of the case, it is not known to outsiders.

### The Battle of Nicheng in Nanhui Captain Huang Martyred

In the battle of Nicheng in Nanhui, the Japanese and puppets asked Nakamura for help from Datuan, and Nakamura immediately sent a team of about 300 soldiers to reinforce them, and a fierce battle broke out with the Chinese side's Gu troops. Huang Jianzhong, the second captain, led his soldiers bravely to meet the enemy, but due to the disparity in numbers, Chen Shang was shot twice. One bullet entered from the right waist and exited from the left waist, and the other bullet entered from the right shoulder and exited from behind the shoulder. Soldiers helped him away and hired a boat overnight to try to transport him to Shanghai for treatment, but he died halfway. Captain Huang was about thirty years old, honest and brave in combat, and had a good relationship with the people. He was formerly the captain of the first company of the special service brigade, and was promoted to the first captain of the first brigade of the independent second team last month, and was still attached to Gu Jimin's troops, and the local people were extremely distressed.

### U.S. Consul General Gauss to Take Up Post After Meeting with Johnson; Will First Return to the U.S. with Family Before Going to Australia; Appointment Awaits Approval from the U.S. State Department

U.S. Consul General in Shanghai, Gauss, received an order from President Roosevelt on the evening of the 8th to serve as the first U.S. Minister to Australia. Mr. Gauss is a veteran in diplomatic circles, having entered the diplomatic service in 1906. He first came to China in 1907 as the U.S. Vice Consul in Shanghai and was promoted to Consul General in Shanghai on December 9, 1935. Mr. Gauss has twice

gone to Washington to report on his duties. He has spent most of his years in China. Mr. Gauss is scheduled to meet with Ambassador Johnson in mid-month and then take his family via Kobe, Honolulu, and San Francisco back to the United States before taking up his new post in Australia. According to Mr. Gauss, after being appointed as the first minister to Australia, he was very pleased. He believes that Australia is an independent

republic within the British Empire. Its friendship and diplomatic contact with the nations of the Pacific and the United States are of great importance, as contact between the two sides will strengthen practical work. After taking office, he will do his best to foster sincere affection and love between the two countries. Having lived in Shanghai for a long time,

parting is naturally filled with reluctance and melancholy. He feels deeply saddened to be separated from the Allied forces in Shanghai, but driven by orders, he has no choice but to temporarily bid farewell. President Roosevelt's dispatch of Gauss to assume this important post undoubtedly relies on Gauss's extensive experience in diplomatic affairs. However, the order is still subject to

the approval of the U.S. State Department, so Mr. Gauss has not yet received official notification. He also does not know who the successor will be, but it is generally believed to be Mr. Locke Heed, who served as Acting Consul General when Mr. Gauss left Shanghai for Manila last year. Mr. Gauss has no so-called opinions to express before taking office. Regarding the transfer of consulate staff, it is said that there will be no changes due to his departure from Shanghai. Before taking office, he will mostly need to first

return to the United States and then proceed to take over the new post. Before coming to Shanghai, Mr. Gauss worked in Washington for several years, then transferred to the Consulate General in Paris. After coming to China, he served in the U.S. Embassy in Beijing for diplomatic affairs and concurrently as Consul in Beijing. Later he was

transferred to Shanghai to serve as the U.S. Consul General in Shanghai. Last year, on November 21, Mr. Gauss accompanied General Heard to Manila for a special meeting to discuss the general interests of the United States in the Far East. He also discussed the upcoming abolition of the U.S.-Japan Commercial Treaty on the 26th of this month, which aroused widespread attention. On the evening of the 2nd of this month, he returned to Shanghai from leave on the President Pierce ship with his wife and eldest son, Charles.

### Strict Prohibition on Silver Shops from Buying or Selling Gold; No Further Production of Gold Ornaments Allowed; Violators Will Be Punished

An order from the Executive Yuan to the municipal governments of each province stated: According to Electricity No. 1513 of the Ministry of Finance in Chongqing, it is stated that the centralized storage of gold is an important policy during extraordinary times. The Ministry has repeatedly issued measures for exchanging gold for legal tender,

measures for encouraging exchange,

measures for supervising silver shops, and has urged the four banks, namely, Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Communications Bank, and Farmers Bank of China, to earnestly collect gold and silver. All provincial governments and their affiliated agencies should thoroughly assist in the process. Since the announcement of the measures for supervising silver shops, the purchase of gold by silver shops, to be used as raw materials, has been limited to gold in the form of ornaments; they are not allowed to purchase gold bars, gold leaves, gold nuggets, or any raw gold. The original intention was to conserve extravagance and eliminate the waste of precious gold.

Since implementation, there has been no shortage of silver shops abiding by government orders. However, there are still many who outwardly comply but inwardly defy, purchasing gold to make ornaments. Some local silver shop owners even secretly raise prices to compete for purchases, entrusting silver shops to crudely make ornaments to facilitate smuggling and hoarding for personal gain. It has been repeatedly reported that in provinces such as Sichuan and Hunan, which are known for gold production, newly produced gold is mostly

purchased at inflated prices, making it difficult for legal and authorized agencies to collect gold according to the official listed prices. If fundamental measures are not taken, it will be difficult to uphold government orders and

national strength. Eleven articles on measures to ban the purchase and sale of gold have now been formulated, announced, and implemented. From the date of implementation, silver shops, or any organization or individual, are strictly prohibited from buying gold bars, gold leaves, gold nuggets, any raw gold, gold utensils, or gold ornaments. Silver shops are also

not allowed to produce

gold ornaments for sale. Existing gold finished products, semi-finished products, and gold materials will be checked and counted by the four banks' collection offices and branches, together with local administrative officials, in accordance with these measures. The collection agencies will collect the items in accordance with the preferential reward measures. Any violations will be punished in accordance with the provisions of these measures. In addition to the Ministry's announcement and telegraphic report to the Military Affairs Commission,

Chairman Chiang

for review, a letter was sent to the joint office of the four banks, the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, the Communications Bank, and the Farmers Bank of China, and forwarded to the gold and silver collection office for compliance, and a separate message was sent to the provincial governments for compliance and assistance. The original measures are listed and sent to the Judicial Yuan to forward to all subordinate courts for compliance. This order (measures omitted)

### Two Chinese Police Officers Arrested, Then Released

The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reported that yesterday (the 9th) at 7:30 p.m., two Chinese police officers of the Public Concession, on duty at Wujiaochang on Baiduhui Road and Nanhui Road, entered a teahouse outside the Concession boundary and were arrested by Japanese military police. Their service pistols and ammunition were confiscated. The Japanese military police immediately notified the Jing'an Temple police station. Within half an hour, a senior police officer from the Police Department retrieved the two Chinese police officers and their pistols. At approximately 7:40 p.m. yesterday, on Kangding Road and Jiesfei Road, in the alley next to Yifengli, three Chinese police officers were urinating when two Japanese military police officers approached and disarmed the Chinese police officers of their three pistols. The three Chinese police officers immediately protested, and the Japanese military police, unable to prevail, quickly returned to the police station to report the incident.

### Commander Minjun of Northern Jiangsu, Ma Yuren, Dies for His Country; Killed in Action at Sanhejian on the 2nd of This Month

Ma Yuren, Commander of the Northern Jiangsu Republic's Anti-Japanese Forces, died heroically at noon on the 3rd of this month in the Sanhejian area of Xinwu Township, District 9, Funing, leading his troops in hand-to-hand combat with the Japanese army. The Jiangsu Provincial Government immediately reported to the central authorities, requesting that he be given a posthumous commendation and that Commander Ma's heroic deeds in resisting Japan be praised. Commander Ma Yuren, whose courtesy name was Bolang, was 63 years old. He was originally from Yancheng, Jiangsu. During the era of the Northern Warlords, he served as the Garrison Commander of Huaiyang for many years and also served as the commander of the 32nd Army of the Northern Expeditionary Army. Later, as he aged and his strength waned, he retired to Shanghai. Until the "August 13th" Shanghai Battle, President Chiang, recognizing Ma's familiarity with the geography of northern Jiangsu, appointed him to the important position of Commander of the Northern Jiangsu People's Anti-Japanese Forces. He then equipped various locations, summoned his old troops, and launched surprise attacks on the Japanese army, repeatedly achieving military successes. After Ma's death, his fellow villagers sent telegrams to express their condolences to his family. It is said that Ma only left behind one grandson and his posthumous affairs are very bleak.

### Revival Bonds Drawn Yesterday; 1.7 Million Yuan in Principal to Be Repaid; Payments to Begin at the End of February

The eighth repayment of principal for the 25th Year of the Republic Revival Bonds was held yesterday morning at 10:00 a.m. at the Bank Club. Fan Jietang of the National Debt Fund Management Committee, Pei Yunqing of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, Wu Yunzhai of the Bankers' Association, Shen Jingxue of the Money Trade Association, Wang Lin of the Central Bank of China, Fan Chuchen of the Communications Bank, and Tang Yuesun of the Bank of China attended. Chairman Pei Yunqing reported,

"Today is the eighth repayment of principal for the 25th Year of the Republic Revival Bonds. The drawing method uses the last three digits. I will briefly report to everyone on the circumstances of these bonds. The Revival Bonds were issued in February of the 25th Year of the Republic with a fixed amount of 34 million national currency. This is the eighth repayment of principal, with five draws, each worth 340,000 yuan, for a total principal repayment of 1.7 million yuan. The principal and interest due on the drawn bonds will be paid starting on February 29, 29th Year of the Republic, in accordance with the regulations of the Ministry of Finance. Payments will be made by the Central Bank of China and its entrusted banks, the Bank of China, the Communications Bank, and the Central Trust Bureau. Now, please inspect the counterfoil books so that the lottery can be carried out." After the inspectors verified that the counterfoils were correct, the representatives of the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, and the Communications Bank carried out the lottery. The drawn numbers are listed below: [170], [483], [591], [696], [837]. As for the numbers, types, number of sheets, and total amount of all the drawn bonds, they will be publicly announced and widely known.

### High Pressure System Advances; Weather Turns Cold

Yesterday's weather in the city was affected by the advance of a high-pressure system to the Yangtze River basin, resulting in a sudden cold snap. A strong northeast wind blew all day, but the sky had already cleared, turning from cloudy to sunny, with sunshine. There was no sign of rain.

As the high pressure system approaching the Yangtze River basin will not cause major changes, the mornings and evenings already feel heavy with dew and frost. The scantily clad poor and beggars cannot withstand the cold.

Since the beginning of winter, there has been no snowfall in various parts of China. According to the observatory, Dalian experienced its first snowfall yesterday. The temperature in Dalian yesterday was 0 degrees Celsius, slightly lower than the previous day.

A low-pressure system seems to be forming in the Tianjin area, so the temperature there is also higher than the previous day. If a low-pressure system does develop there, the weather in the city may also be affected, resulting in rain or snow. However, it is still difficult to predict whether it will form. There has been no rainfall in the city since the rainfall on November 26 last year.

After the weather turned cold, the death rate of beggars sleeping on the streets and refugees in various shelters increased sharply. According to a reporter from the Datong News Agency's inquiry at the Pushan Villa, the hall had collected 12 corpses of people who had frozen to death on the road the day before, which had increased to 22 yesterday.

The temperature in the city decreased further yesterday, dropping below freezing in the morning between 5:00 and 6:00 a.m. Observing the weather, it may become even colder during the day. Also, since the 8th, the high tide in the Huangpu River has erupted suddenly, and it will take until the 11th to subside. As a result, there has been accumulated water on the roads in the shady areas at zero hour in the afternoon for several days.

### British Straits Settlements Government Limits Import of Goods Not from Sterling Countries; Shanghai National Product Manufacturers Are Very Anxious

In addition to doing everything possible to sell domestically, most of the national products produced by various national product factories in the city are shipped to various territories in the Nanyang region, namely, the Malay Peninsula, the Philippine Islands, the Dutch East Indies, Vietnam, Thailand, and Burma. Approximately 8 million overseas Chinese reside in these regions and enthusiastically adopt national products from their motherland. Therefore, the value of national products sold to the south each month is quite substantial. Now, the British Straits Settlements government has issued a ban, and Shanghai is one of the places listed as prohibited. Upon hearing this, the various national product factories in the city are extremely anxious and have jointly sent a letter to the national product inspection representatives stationed overseas. The original letter is recorded below: [Dear Sirs, We have heard that the British Straits Settlements government, in order to control foreign trade and strengthen the domestic economic base, issued a ban and restriction on the import of goods from non-sterling countries on November 17 of last year. Goods from sterling countries are not subject to the ban. A large number of national products from Shanghai are shipped to the region each month. If this is implemented, it will inevitably suffer a severe blow. Therefore, the various national product factories in Shanghai are extremely anxious. We have learned that 76 types of goods are subject to restrictions on import into the Straits Settlements, and 236 types are prohibited from import. We dare to ask you to investigate and reply on our behalf.]

### Sketches of Charity Food and Ginger Tea Distribution

— Yangtze River

(Special Feature by this Newspaper) The cold wave has struck, and the temperature has plummeted to below zero again. The numerous collection vehicles of the charity halls are shuttling back and forth, which clearly reflects how the dark side of the extremely "prosperous" "isolated island" is expanding and deepening.

According to the statistics of the Public Works Department, there were 32 refugee shelters in the Public Concession a month ago, housing 37,319 refugees. From these numbers, we can imagine the difficulties these many homeless and wandering compatriots are facing, and the urgent need for assistance they have!

Recently, the Shanghai Charity Organizations Federation, in view of the rising prices and the hardship of the lives of ordinary poor people and refugees who have come to Shanghai to take refuge, has specially allocated funds to set up shelters at 330 North Fujian Road and the Catholic Church in Xujiahui. The first shelter has already accommodated more than 800 poor people, solving their difficulties in getting through the cold winter. At the same time, in order to relieve the poor who are suffering from hunger and cold, they have been distributing steamed buns and hot ginger tea on the streets since the night before last (the first day of the twelfth lunar month).

In previous years, the places where various charity groups distributed relief were originally in the area south of the racecourse and Huangmen Road. This year, because the 20-road trolley bus has started operating, in order to maintain good order, it has been necessary to move to a more convenient location.

Around 7:00 p.m. the night before last, a transport vehicle from the Charity Organizations Federation carried more than 3,500 steamed buns and two large wooden barrels of hot ginger tea to the middle section of Xin Datian Road for distribution. More than 1,000 poor people waiting for relief had already gathered there. They were all dressed in very thin and ragged clothes. Most of them were laborers, rickshaw pullers, refugees, and street beggars. Old and young, carrying hope, they rushed here, crowding the not very wide Xin Datian Road.

With the efforts of several staff members of the Charity Organizations Federation and patrol police officers to maintain order, all the gathered poor people were cordoned off with ropes on the sidewalks and came out in single file. Each person was given two steamed buns made of flour (each weighing four ounces, with a total of eight bags of flour used on the first day, each bag weighing 36 catties), and a bowl of hot ginger tea (made by boiling local ginger and brown sugar, the taste is sweet and spicy, and eating it can increase body temperature and resist the invasion of cold air).

This relief work is very beneficial to the poor. It started on the 9th and will end on February 7 (that is, the end of the lunar year). This news should be celebrated by the poor on the frozen and hungry road! However, it is said that the Charity Organizations Federation is extremely short of funds for relief, especially today when the dark side of the "isolated island" is expanding and deepening, and their relief work has more of a feeling that there are more monks than there is gruel. We hope that all sectors will generously donate!

### Resolution to Eliminate Commissions for Prescriptions; New Pharmaceutical Industry Immediately Notifies Member Pharmacies to Implement

The Shanghai New Pharmaceutical Industry Association, acting on the advice of ten doctors, including Zhun Diaoxinde, Wang Wanbai, and Shi Siming, suggested that pharmacies often give commissions to doctors for prescriptions as a means of liaison. This expense is indirectly taken from the patients, and from a moral standpoint, it is not appropriate. They requested that a resolution be established and that member pharmacies be notified to eliminate this long-standing practice. The association specially convened a meeting of the Standing Committee at its meeting place on Longmen Road at 3:00 p.m. yesterday, and decided to accept the proposal. It immediately notified the member pharmacies to follow the instructions.

### Gonorrhea Lecture: Prostatitis Has Been Resolved

— Written by Dr. Yao Juyan

Clinic: 9 Ningbo Road, intersection of 430 Road. Clinic hours: 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.

If gonorrhea is not treated promptly, it often becomes chronic gonorrhea, and in most cases, it easily turns into prostatitis. Once it becomes prostatitis, the symptoms fluctuate and are difficult to eliminate. The symptoms are initially difficulty in urination, frequent urination, and swelling in the anus and perineum. Later, these symptoms gradually disappear, and the urine changes from turbid to clear and transparent. On the surface, it is almost the same as before the illness. However, it is not known that these gonococci are deeply lurking and waiting for an opportunity to act. Whenever one encounters drinking, labor, or sexual intercourse, the disease suddenly recurs. If this continues to recur, the body will weaken day by day, and there is a risk of prostatitis leading to infertility. It is necessary to seek treatment quickly. Recently, there has been a fundamental solution for this difficult-to-treat prostatitis. That is, to use the gonorrhea holy medicine [Kelinong] as an internal medicine to resist bacteriophages, so that the gonococci in the prostate gland have no room to survive and are eliminated. For those with enlarged glands, alternating use of German electrotherapy and X-ray electrotherapy can be used to eliminate gonorrhea toxins, correct the disease, and restore original health. I have been in clinical practice for nearly 20 years, and I have used almost all kinds of gonorrhea treatments. However, their advantages and disadvantages are half and half, or the good does not cover the bad. None of them are as safe and thorough as the treatment I described above. Moreover, there are no residual undesirable symptoms after curing gonorrhea, which is especially commendable. Clinic hours: 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Starting today, 20 consultation tickets will be sent out every day. Each ticket costs only 5 dimes and comes with a copy of the book "Complete Book on Sexually Transmitted Diseases." Also treats syphilis, gonorrhea, and sexual neurasthenia.

### Postal Headquarters Bloodshed; Western Police Officer Shot; Head of Cleaning Workers Enraged; Police Officer Wounded in Chest While Investigating; Seriously Wounded, Perpetrator Arrested on the Spot

The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reported that Crane Kerr, a 21-year-old Western police officer of the Public Concession Police Department, was shot while mediating a dispute at the postal headquarters on North Suzhou Road at noon today (the 10th). He sustained a chest wound and is seriously injured. He is now being treated at the Country Hospital. The perpetrator is a Mr. A, the manager of a cleaning company, who has been arrested by detectives from the Wayside police station. It is reported that workers from the cleaning company had a dispute with an employee of the postal headquarters at the tiger stove yesterday (the 9th). Mr. A, the manager of the cleaning company, took a pistol and went to the postal headquarters with several people at noon today to reason with the employee who had the dispute yesterday. Another heated argument ensued. Patrol officers on North Suzhou Road who were searching pedestrians heard the report and went to the post office to inquire. As Crane Kerr entered the post office, a bullet suddenly struck his upper chest. Whether the shooter intended to fire or it was accidental due to anger cannot yet be determined. However, there were two shots fired at the time. Mr. A, who fired the shots, was arrested by police officers from the Wayside police station.

(Special report from this newspaper) After 12:00 noon yesterday, a shooting occurred in the courtyard of the North Sichuan Road Postal Administration, injuring Western police officer Crane Kerr. After this incident occurred, the Hongkou Wayside police station arrested and detained the perpetrator, Bao Depei, as well as Weng Yongyuan, a coolie from the parcel delivery team of the post office, and a Mr. Meng, a coolie from the empty bag room. According to news obtained by this newspaper, the details are as follows:

Cause of the Incident

The Postal Administration has a tiger stove on the ground floor, which is exclusively for the use of the bureau's staff. Recently, due to soaring coal prices, the restrictions on water collection by letter carriers in the bureau have been tightened. It is stipulated that only those wearing uniforms can collect water. The cleaning of the bureau is contracted to the Far East Cleaning Company, which dispatches more than 20 workers to work in the bureau on a regular basis, and dispatches Bao Depei to supervise the workers. Recently, the workers have been refused water collection, and often argue with the bureau workers, and neither side will give in. This has been the cause of the incident for more than a day.

Mutual Disputes

Therefore, at noon yesterday, Bao requested that the bureau go to the tiger stove to negotiate. Unexpectedly, the words caused mutual disputes. Bao was surrounded by more than 20 people from the parcel delivery team of the bureau, including Weng Yongyuan from Jiangbei and Meng from the empty bag room. Bao was anxious and took out his pistol to demonstrate. When the besieged saw the gun, they began to flee. Unexpectedly, when they approached the courtyard, they were surrounded by two other people. Bao's bullets were ejected from the chamber. According to eyewitnesses, it penetrated the sole of the shoe of a worker from the Far East Cleaning Company, but the foot was not injured.

Western Police Officer Shot

While the conflict between the two sides was intensifying, Crane Kerr, a Western police officer trainee on patrol on North Sichuan Road, heard about it. Kerr immediately entered the post office to investigate the situation, and attempted to take Bao Depei's pistol. Unexpectedly, a disaster followed. The bullet struck the upper chest of the Western police officer. It is said that the gun was discharged due to accidental discharge. After being injured, Kerr used the phone on the third floor to notify the Wayside police station in charge, which immediately dispatched a large number of detectives to suppress the incident, and arrested Bao Depei, a member of the cleaning company who committed the crime, and Weng Yongyuan and Meng, coolies from the post office, and sent them to the Wayside police station for interrogation. An ambulance was called to transport Western police officer Crane Kerr to the Country Hospital for treatment.

Kerr's Brief History

According to reports, Kerr is 20 years old and a graduate of Shanghai West College. He is the brother-in-law of Western police officer patrol Da Huier. Another sister has already passed away. Her husband, Clolai, once worked at the Jianghai Customs and was killed in Hankou in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River last year. His old mother lives in Shanghai, and his father died early. Kerr is currently a Western police officer trainee at the Wayside police station. After being injured, he was sent to the Country Hospital for treatment. It is said that the bullet did not penetrate and the injury is quite serious.

### Thugs Intend to Rob; Frightened and Flee

The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reported that Dr. Mark Kang, a physician at the American International Assurance Company, lives at 244 Hongkou Road. At 9:15 p.m. last night (the 9th), Dr. Mark suddenly heard a loud noise downstairs on the second floor of his residence. He leaned out the window and seemed to hear the sound of a pistol being cocked. He went downstairs and asked in Chinese, "Who is it?" He faintly heard someone answer, "Telephone." Dr. Mark returned upstairs and rang for the servant. As the servant was about to go upstairs, he was struck hard on the back of the head and fell to the ground with a loud noise. The thugs seemed to have been frightened and fled in groups. Afterwards, Dr. Mark found out that the loud noise he had heard earlier was caused by the shattering of glass on the doors of the dining room and study. The stool in front of the piano was also slightly damaged. The chauffeur then called the Public Concession Police Department, and the Jing'an Temple police station dispatched a team of detectives, who cooperated with the Japanese military police to investigate the scene.

### Japanese Transportation Company: Chauffeur Embezzles Raw Silk, Sells It for 19,000 Yuan, Chauffeur at Large, Accomplices Sentenced to Detention

The Japanese Tongyun Transfer Company, located at 213 Shandong Road, instructed chauffeur Feng Zixiang on the 19th of last month to transport raw silk worth 41,600 yuan to the Dehua Transfer Company in the Securities Building on Jiujiang Road. Unexpectedly, Feng embezzled the silk and

Fled Without a Trace

After Tongyun Company reported the incident to the General Inspectorate, Japanese Detective Kobayashi, Chinese Detective Jiang Shangpei, Detective Inspector Yan Heng, and Ren Fengwu launched an investigation. They discovered that Feng had prior knowledge of the shipment before being instructed to transport it, indicating malicious intent. He consulted with his friend Cui Zhenmin regarding the sale of the embezzled goods. Cui introduced him to Xu Yusheng, who in turn introduced him to Shou Chunlin. Shou then connected him with someone named Yang Yiqing, who

Intended to Purchase

and instructed Feng to deliver the goods to the Zhonghua Transfer Company at 16, Lane 305, 16 Fujian Road, to be handed over to Zhang Huaiting from Shaoxing. Consequently, Feng delivered the silk to the Zhonghua Transfer Company as ordered, and Yang paid Feng 19,000 yuan in legal tender, completing the transaction. Yang then immediately pawned the goods to Ruihe Foreign Firm. The detectives subsequently

Arrested

Zhang Huaiting, Xu Yusheng, Cui Zhenmin, and Shou Chunlin one after another. Feng Zixiang and Yang Yiqing remain at large. Under interrogation, it was learned that Xu, Cui, and Shou each received 700 yuan in compensation from Feng. The detectives recovered 1,555 yuan of the compensation. Yesterday morning, the Shanxi Prefectural Court, represented by lawyer Ru Baozuo, prosecuted them under Article 349 of the Criminal Law for acting as intermediaries in the sale of stolen goods. They stated that when Yang paid Feng the selling price of 19,000 yuan, 800 yuan was missing, and Zhang Huaiting

Advanced 800

yuan to cover the shortage. This 800 yuan has not yet been recovered. After questioning by Qian Hongye, the presiding judge of the criminal court, Xu Yusheng, Cui Zhenmin, and Shou Chunlin were found guilty of acting as intermediaries for stolen goods and sentenced to 50 days of detention and fined 100 yuan each. Zhang Huaiting was found not guilty.

### Paternal Uncle Indecently Entices Woman into Adultery, Sentenced to Eight Months Imprisonment

Zhou Jinhui, a Ningbo native residing at 699 Maigen Road, is a coppersmith foreman in the machinery department of a coal briquette company. His daughter, Yunmei (18 years old), was lured out by Zhou Zongpin, a fellow townsman, around 10 a.m. on June 2 of last year, under the false pretense of introducing her to work at the Hongda Silk Factory on Singapore Road. He tricked her into staying overnight at the Xinzha Inn on Xinzha Road. The next day, he took her to the home of Wang Wenyu, a Jiaxing native, at 33 Yongshun Lane, Jiaozhou Road, renting the upper floor and cohabiting with her until August of this year. When Zhou Zongpin ran out of money, he instructed Yunmei to secretly return home. Her father, Zhou Jinhui, learned the truth and reported it to the Gordon Road Police Station. Detectives were dispatched to arrest Zhou Zongpin, but were unsuccessful. The informant learned that Zhou Zongpin was hiding in the Xinpíng Coal Briquette Shop on Route Ferguson in the French Concession. They secretly went to the address and arrested him, taking him into custody at the police station. Yesterday, he was handed over to the Special Court. Police lawyer Qian Xun prosecuted him for enticing adultery and disrupting the family. He stated that the defendant claimed at the police station that he had a physical relationship with Yunmei around May of the 16th year of the Republic and that the woman was willing, requesting prosecution. Subsequently, Yunmei and her father, Zhou Jinhui, testified about the events. Zhou Jinhui stated that the defendant was a distant cousin and should not have committed such an indecent act. When questioned, the defendant claimed that he and Yunmei were cousins, that his mother was the plaintiff's sister, and that the relationship with Yunmei occurred before August 12. The plaintiff was aware of the situation, and he paid 20 yuan per month for household expenses. Recently, he was unable to pay, so he reported the matter to the police. He pleaded for leniency. Judge Xiao Peishen, finding Zhou Zongpin's behavior immoral and indecent for enticing a woman under twenty years old away from her family, sentenced him to eight months in prison as a warning.

### A Dancing Girl is Murdered in Jing'an Villa, Chen Aimei Found Dead in Her Room with Knife Wounds, Neighbors Report to Police, Body Removed for Examination, Murderer at Large, Room in Disarray

Chen Aimei, a young woman of 29, worked as a dancer at the Huideng Ballroom. She resided in Room 11 on the upper floor of Building 109 in Jing'an Villa on Jing'an Temple Road. The woman was quite attractive, so she had many admirers. Previously, Aimei had lived there with her older sister. However, her older sister was violent and had been reported to the police by neighbors for mistreating a servant several months ago,

leading to her prosecution for assault and imprisonment. Therefore, Aimei

lived alone

in the residence. Around 8:50 p.m. last night, residents on the lower floor of Building 109 heard noises coming from Room 11. Because each person minds their own business, they did not investigate further. After a while, everything went silent. However, soon after, they heard faint groans,

arousing suspicion.

They went upstairs and knocked on the door, but it was locked from the inside and there was no response. Looking through the keyhole, they saw Chen Aimei lying on the bed, the room in disarray. Believing that she had taken poison, the residents immediately telegraphed the police and requested an ambulance. Police officers managed to open the door and enter the room. Unexpectedly, they found no one else inside. The woman was lying in a pool of blood, which had splattered everywhere. There were five or six knife wounds on her body, and she was already

dead.

A closer examination of the room revealed that everything was in disarray, as if there had been a struggle before her death. Police detectives, understanding the situation, immediately dismissed the ambulance and dispatched a hearse to take the woman's body to the hospital for a preliminary examination before transferring it to the coroner's office for an autopsy, pending a court-ordered examination. Meanwhile, detectives searched the woman's room for evidence to track down the murderer. According to nearby residents, two or four days prior, the woman had

A Young Man

had an argument at the side entrance of the building. Their dispute was quite heated. It turned out that the woman had an appointment with a male friend and had just dressed up and left the house. The young man also arrived in a car to pick her up, but she politely declined. The young man appeared displeased, and there were

Signs of Jealousy

in his words. The woman tried to explain, but she was unable to contain her anger and retorted. This sparked an argument that almost led to physical violence. Eventually, bystanders intervened, and the young man drove away angrily in his car. However, whether this is related to the case remains to be seen.

### Public Bus Accident, Driver Sentenced to Imprisonment

On the 21st of last month, Public Bus No. 1506 on Route 5, due to the driver Hu Baozai's careless driving, crashed into the Hentaly Watch Store at the intersection of Henan Road and Nanjing Road. At the same time, it ran over and killed Hu Huanrong, who was riding a bicycle. The police prosecuted Hu Baozai in the Special First Court for causing death due to negligence in the course of his business. Hu Baozai hired lawyers Fan Gang and Yu Enliang to defend him. After the trial concluded, Judge Feng Shide announced the verdict in the First Criminal Court yesterday. Hu Baozai was sentenced to one year of imprisonment with a two-year suspended sentence. Police lawyer Ru Bao Yi requested that he be remanded in custody pending the appeal period. The court ordered Hu Baozai to be remanded in custody at the police station during the appeal period.

### Social Miscellany

Around 7 a.m. yesterday, 18 bandits suddenly broke into a residence at 1032 Chengdu Road. Seven of the bandits pulled out pistols and threatened the occupants. They robbed them of clothing and cash worth approximately 5,000 yuan before fleeing without a trace. Afterward, the victims filed a list of stolen items and reported the incident to the local police station, requesting an investigation.

At 4646 Seymour Road, three bandits broke in at 9:50 a.m. yesterday. One of the bandits held a gun and ordered silence. They robbed them of over 600 yuan before fleeing. Li Zhenyuan (18 years old), a guest at the Southeast Hotel on Baike Road, suddenly slit his throat with a sharp blade in his room around 8 a.m. yesterday. He was discovered and rushed to the hospital, but he died because his throat was severed.

Yang Shicheng (21 years old), a Jiangbei native and a worker at the Riya Silk Factory at 1628 Pingliang Road in Pudong, was working when a large piece of iron fell from above and struck him in the chest. Due to the severity of the injury, he was taken to the Shanghai East Hospital, where he died.

### Letter to the Editor

To the Editor,

Having recently read in your newspaper about eight burly men suddenly appearing at the Fusheng Entertainment Society in Wujiaochang, Caoyang, and arresting an accountant named Zhu Pinfang, the reason for which was unknown, I was deeply shocked. I have always been law-abiding and have been assisting in the Zhulongtai Noodle Shop established by my cousin to make a living. I have absolutely no involvement in the above situation. I believe that the report is inaccurate. I am deeply concerned that my friends and relatives may misunderstand the truth, so I am writing this letter requesting a correction. Sincerely, Zhu Pinfang. Witnessed by Wanshenghao.

To the Editor,

In the Shanghai Local News section of your newspaper dated January 8, there was a news item about Chen Yuqin being shot. It mentioned that she had been a teacher at the Shanghai Chinese Girls' Middle School after the August 13th Incident. After investigation, there is no Chen Yuqin or Chen Yuqing among the faculty and staff of our school. I am writing to inform you accordingly, hoping that you will investigate and make a correction. Respectfully, Chinese Girls' Middle School, January 10th.

A Brief Discussion

### Everyone Talk

— Huang Jiayin

The reason why so many foreigners read books, newspapers, and magazines is not only due to the popularity of education, but also to the precision and relevance of the selection of materials for Western magazines to life and society, as well as the lively style of writing. There is probably no one in the world who is not naturally fond of reading books and newspapers. The reason why fewer Chinese people read books and newspapers seems to be partly due to the fact that articles fail to arouse readers' interest.

Not only are there many readers abroad, but also writers are not limited to literary figures. Writers and reporters write articles, officials and dignitaries also write articles, teachers and students write articles, shop assistants and vendors also write articles, and even dancing girls, prostitutes, and vagrants write articles. Therefore, the range of their article materials is wider, and the interest is also stronger. We feel that this is something that our country's publishing industry should emulate.

There are more than 360 industries in the world, and it is impossible to become a champion in every one of them. Therefore, we can only rely on pens and ink, printing presses and paper, to convey our thoughts, to express our emotions, to laugh and scold, to cry and weep.

We believe that everyone has at least one good article to write. The question is whether or not they are willing to write it. Therefore, we hope that every Shen Bao reader writes an article, and every Free Talk reader writes an article.

Free Talk is a free and open garden. To encourage readers to write articles, we are launching "Free Micro-Essays" here first. The following are simple submission rules:

(1) Topic: Shanghai Like This (Please expose the contradictions and darkness of Shanghai society as you see it in your mind, and the sorrows and pains you have personally experienced, in a concise style without mercy)

(2) Word count: Do not exceed 500 words

(3) Style: Free

(4) Please indicate "Free Micro-Essay" on the envelope

(5) Please stamp the manuscript; unsolicited manuscripts will not be returned

(6) Send the manuscript to the Free Talk Editorial Department

(7) Selected manuscripts will be published in Free Talk at any time

### A Brief Account of Burma

— Da Nian

The visit of the Burmese delegation to China this time and the establishment of the Sino-Burmese Cultural Association in Chongqing can be said to be a major event in Sino-Burmese relations. This article tells us what kind of place Burma is. - Editor

It's eight o'clock in the morning, and your Burmese servant is calling you to get up. He will say to you, "The sun is already as high as a palm tree." The Burmese have always used this poetic phrase to represent eight o'clock in the morning. Similarly, the Burmese do not call late at night late at night; they call that time "when people don't walk."

The Burmese are poetic, so their temperaments are so amiable, and their lives are so happy and tasteful. They are the most fun-loving people in the Far East, always with a smile on their faces. Burma is full of temples and pagodas. They have been living their lives in the bell sound of the pagodas. The most wonderful teachings of Buddhism are also their philosophy. Geography books tell us that Burma is known for exporting rice, oil, and teak. However, tourists who occasionally come to Burma may not believe that the Burmese even have the time to export their native products, because except for September and December, the Burmese are busy eating, drinking, and having fun all the time. Frankly speaking, the Burmese are the least willing to do much work and the least willing to do it often. They let elephants do the logging work for them in the teak forests, let the Scots monopolize the oil industry, and let women take care of the rice fields for them.

Burmese women are as free and equal as men in society. They do more things than Burmese men and enjoy more benefits than men. The economic power of the family is in their hands. They have the right to vote in city elections. They can own private property, and they enjoy the same rights after marriage as men.

In Burma, neither men nor women wear trousers. They both wear a cotton short shirt on the upper body and a skirt on the lower body. The weekly needs of each family, including rent, are only about one shilling (approximately 4-5 yuan in national currency). Only clothing is considered a relatively expensive item for the Burmese.

The Burmese are generally wealthy, which can be seen from their fondness for cigars. Square-headed cigars can be bought for two shillings for a hundred in Burma. Because they are so cheap, almost everyone can afford them. Women can smoke as many as twenty a day when they have nothing to do.

In terms of entertainment, the Burmese love cockfighting and castrated cattle racing. The latter seems as interesting as turtle racing to foreigners.

Burma is the country with the fewest illiterates, with 87 percent of the people able to read and write. Because Burmese education is closely related to religion, many teachers are monks. The Burmese make their religion a source of happiness to suit their optimistic attitude.

Burma has all kinds of transportation and transportation tools. There are rickshaws, the latest model trams, and 2,000 miles of railways connecting all of Burma. The famous small fleet in the Irrawaddy River still travels to Mandalay from time to time. Although Burma has such complete means of transportation, the Burmese still think that sitting on the back of an elephant is the most enviable thing. The Burmese call elephants "brothers" because they believe that elephants are the most loyal animals.

Historical Anecdotes

### Who is Chen Yuanyuan?

— Jiang Qi

"Chen Yuanyuan" will premiere tonight. The author of the play tells us here: Who is Chen Yuanyuan? - Editor

What kind of person is Chen Yuanyuan after all? Maybe someone will ask this question with concern.

Flipping through many biographies and unofficial histories, there are many derogatory words about Chen Yuanyuan, and very few who clear her name.

The saying that women are a source of trouble has been around for a long time. In addition, ancient poets and writers always like to especially emphasize and exaggerate the "love of heroes and beauties." Unfortunately, Chen Yuanyuan was not born with a harelip or pockmarks. Therefore, her beauty alone was enough to bear the crime of "overthrowing the country and the city."

However, that is not necessarily the whole truth. Historians have not completely erased their conscience. They wrote about how Wu Sangui was willing to shave his hair and keep a braid, surrender to the Manchus, how he bitterly pursued and forced Li Chuang to the point of exhaustion, and how cruelly and cruelly he personally killed the last drop of Ming blood, the Yongli Emperor. Unintentionally, we discovered the evidence that Wu Sangui did not completely betray his country and surrender to the enemy for Chen Yuanyuan. On the contrary, it tells us that Wu Sangui was mainly willing to overthrow the country because of his political ambitions.

If this reason is not sufficient, then I would like to cite the historical fact that Chen Yuanyuan entered the mountains to practice Taoism in her later years to end her remaining years to illustrate that Chen Yuanyuan was not favored and eventually died in depression. More decisively, I want to assert that Chen Yuanyuan was not a woman without a soul or understanding of righteousness.

Chen Yuanyuan was a famous prostitute in the Yu Feng troupe in her early years, but she was originally a lady from a wealthy family. She also knew poetry and etiquette when she was young. Because she suffered from the disaster of war and was abducted and sold by villains, this can be confirmed from many aspects. It is not too much to ask a Chen Yuanyuan who has read the books of sages and sages to understand the principles of heroic women sacrificing themselves for righteousness and great men serving the country with loyalty, right?

Wu Sangui, a young and promising hero and famous general, since Chen Yuanyuan married him, how passionately she loved him! She may not have known about his mid-way change of heart and surrender to the Manchus in advance, but afterward, would Chen Yuanyuan be willing to remain silent about this act that would be condemned for all ages? No, definitely not.

No matter what kind of loyal words Chen Yuanyuan had given to Wu Sangui, these loyal words had more or less influenced Wu Sangui's rebellion against the Qing Dynasty in his later years. Chen Yuanyuan, a weak woman without any status in the normal society, even if we cannot say that she has merit, at least, from all aspects of indirect evidence, I dare to say that she is innocent and pure.

### Hitler's Wartime Life

— Wen He

After the outbreak of the European War, Hitler claimed to be "Germany's number one soldier." Now his day and night life is the life of "Germany's number one soldier."

From early morning to late at night, he is always discussing the war with military and diplomatic advisors. The discussion takes place in Hitler's newly built, heavily guarded Prime Minister's Office. A steel helmet is always hanging in his closet, so he can put on his commander-in-chief's uniform at any time.

Although his daily work is tense, his life is still as simple as before. He has issued food coupons to all Germans, but this has not affected his own simple food. At 7 a.m., he has his first breakfast: drinking some milk or juice, and eating two or three slices of toasted bread or jam bread. Two hours later, he has another breakfast, this time with some fresh fruit.

After the second breakfast, he begins to receive guests. Goering comes to see him almost every day, and Commander-in-Chief Keitel also comes in person to report on the situation on the front line. In addition, the people who come and go often include Dr. Diedrich, Director of the Press Bureau, Nazi No. 3 tycoon Hess, Hitler's personal representative, Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, returning ambassadors, and the staff of the Führer's personal staff.

At lunch, Hitler is often surrounded by several close friends. This meal is still very simple, usually some stewed vegetables. He does not eat meat, but he often has some light wine or light beer. After the meal, he receives guests again.

He only leaves the Prime Minister's Office when something is very important. He goes for a walk in the garden behind the building every day as a physical exercise. The sidewalk is covered, so he goes for a walk every time, regardless of the weather.

Hitler is a big movie fan. There is a screening room in the Prime Minister's Office, and he spends his nights watching movies: newsreels and newly released films from various countries.

### Garbo Helps Finland

— Hua Zhi

The mysterious star Greta Garbo recently donated US$5,000 from her private funds, under the title of "Anonymous," to Finland, which has been invaded, as war funds, arousing great interest among people.

Garbo is originally from Sweden. She loves her motherland very much. Finland's invasion will directly affect Sweden's safety. Therefore, she was filled with righteous indignation and resolutely donated funds to help the Finns. According to rumors from Hollywood filmmakers, Garbo has donated a lot of money anonymously, and no one outside knows. Moreover, if Sweden is threatened and resists, she is ready to return home to serve.

Garbo used to be famous for her eccentricity. She liked to be indifferent, silent, and single. Few people knew that she had a patriotic flame hidden in her heart. It is said that she has recently started filming a comedy, which is based on a female spy in Moscow. The plot will be revised, and it will be completely changed into an anti-aggression film, with herself as the screenwriter and director.

### Miscellaneous Writings in the Art World

Yu Ling writes Daughter Country

The Shanghai Drama Society's "Motherland" and "Regret at the End of the Ming Dynasty" have been extended again and again, but the actors are no longer able to support it. In the last few days of the lunar New Year, Group B was transferred up. The run of "Chen Yuanyuan" naturally cannot be determined either. It is expected that at most one more play can be performed until the lunar New Year. Therefore, Yu Ling is burying himself in hard work, writing "Daughter Country," preparing to stage it in the New Year. Yu Ling has written "Girls' Apartment" and "Tears Splashed on Flowers," and this "Daughter Country" can be said to be a "women" trilogy.

Lan Lan on the screen again

Lan Lan once made a cameo appearance as Chen Peipei in Chen Kengran's "Girls' Apartment." After "Motherland" was taken down recently, she had a longer period of free time. Coincidentally, the Guohua Company was lacking an actress in "Dong Xiaowan," which was scheduled to be released on the lunar New Year, so they asked Shu Shi to discuss it with Lan Lan to make another cameo appearance. There are not many scenes in this role. According to Zhang Shichuan, it can be completed in a few days, and there is no problem catching up with the rehearsals for "Daughter Country." Lan Lan decided to agree to appear on the screen again.

### Announcement of Thunderstorm Lineup

— Ti Gong

After the announcement of the "Thunderstorm" advertisement, the audience remained questioning. The reason for the delay in making the announcement was that Tian (probably a performer's name) had just returned from Chongqing and, after a short stay, was unable to participate in the performance. Repeated discussions and deliberations were held, and a final decision was reached only at midnight on the 6th, to present the following lineup:

Zhou Puyuan: Xin Fang

Fanyi: Su Wen

Zhou Ping: Ti Gong

Zhou Chong: Sang Hu

Lu Gui: Chang Shan

Hui Feng: Hui Cong

Shi Ping: Hui Lan

Da Hai: Bo Sui

Servant A: Da Lang

Servant B: Hai Sheng

Old Servant

Chang Shan is also a member of the Yi Feng troupe and should (a word missing, likely "originally") have been in the "Four Texts of Su Chen." (He) previously participated in performances with the China Arts Troupe in Hong Kong, and his portrayal of Lu Gui was widely praised as being no less than Jiang Ming's. This time, with his familiarity, success is assured. Bo Sui's change to the role of Da Hai, with his rough and straightforward personality, is fitting. Hui Lan, formerly the Ming opera actress Ma (missing part of name) Yun, has been praised by director Zhu Duanjun since rehearsals began as comparable to Ruo Qing. As for the polished and profound acting skills of Xin Fang, Su Wen, and Hui Cong, there is little need for further elaboration. The weaker ones are undoubtedly Sang Hu and myself. However, although the new recruits are tired, placing them in a battle-tested elite team may be enough to inspire them to forget themselves, strive to repay the country, and I and Sang Hu should encourage each other to live up to the earnest expectations of the gentlemen who appreciate our efforts.

### The Collective of Refugee Children: The Nanguang Opera Troupe

— Wan Yu

The Nanguang Opera Troupe is organized by outstanding refugee children from all the Shanghai shelters. Their goal is "to struggle out of danger and strive for light!" It is evident that, at this time and in this place, even the suffering children living in hardship are mobilizing collectively. For the sake of easier expression, their training emphasizes songs more than opera. In the eight months since its establishment, they have learned dozens of magnificent and inspiring songs that touch the heart, and have rehearsed nearly ten one-act plays, the scripts of which are also quite meaningful in their implicit and natural expression.

In the past, they have performed extensively at Jinghua Middle School, the YMCA, and at memorial programs of various children's organizations, once, twice, and three times. The achievements have given them great encouragement, which in turn has inspired them to continue. In addition, they respond to invitations from various parties, implement a "little teacher" system, and serve as teachers in many places where children gather.

Now, in addition to receiving general education every day, they devote their remaining time to opera. Their only mentor is that young man, whose face never shows a trace of fatigue, named Mr. Gao Ge.

### A Wonderful Film Starring Entirely Women: Snippets of "The Women"

— Xu Xu

The film "The Women," produced by MGM with all its might, has not a single male fly in it. The actors are of course female, and even the cats, dogs, and other livestock are all female. The photographs hanging on the walls and the decorations displayed on the cabinets are all feminine. The books on the shelves in the library are all by female authors.

Norma Shearer, Joan Crawford, and Rosalind Russell, the three leading ladies, are the three fragrant shoes in "The Women." One is a virtuous wife who manages the household well, one is a charming enchantress, and one is a gossipy troublemaker. Charlie Chaplin's wife, Paulette Goddard, also plays a very important role in "The Women."

Joan Crawford's bathing scene took a full eleven hours to shoot. The bathtub was the latest style of glass, filled with artificial foam. Joan Crawford was completely naked, and her performance was very impressive. Because the specially made soap foam only lasted for five minutes, Joan Crawford spared no effort, waiting for the artificial foam to be processed and manufactured each time. As a result of overwork, she slept for two full days after filming this scene and lost six pounds.

The valuable jewelry, worth US$50,000, was protected by bodyguards all around during filming to prevent any accidents.

The costumes were all the latest styles of 1940, numbering between two hundred and thirty to seven. The set had thirty-five halls. The 1,300-square-foot beauty salon was fully equipped with massage exercises, bathing, and facials.

The most exciting scene is the women's fight, in which both sides roll up their sleeves and arms, first slap each other, then grab each other's hair, one hating to pull down her underpants, and the other hating to bite her. It appears on the screen for less than a thousand feet, but it took three days to film before it was successfully completed. "The Women" will be released soon at the Dahua Grand Theater, so wait and see!
