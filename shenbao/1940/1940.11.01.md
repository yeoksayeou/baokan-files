The news of the Chinese army's recapture of Nanning reached here in Liuzhou at 6 AM this morning. Reporters immediately reported to Guizhou and other places via long-distance telephone and used various methods to inform all sectors of the city. For a time, the city's residents ran around spreading the news, filled with unexpected joy. All government agencies, organizations, shops, and households hung flags, and the sound of firecrackers never ceased throughout the day. It is noted that the Japanese troops landed at Qinzhou Bay on November 15th of last year and invaded Nanning on the 24th of the same month. Up to today, they had occupied the city for a total of eleven months and six days. During this period, the Japanese military used a maximum force of four divisions, amounting to 100,000 men. In total, they used a force of five and a half divisions, totaling 140,000 men. Due to the water, soil, and climate, the disease and death rate was 20%. The combat mortality rate was slightly over 33%. In total, the loss of personnel reached 74,000 men. The loss of other materials was countless. (Dispatch on the 30th)

The Chongqing Xinhua Daily published an article today stating that the Japanese withdrawal from Nanning was to avoid total annihilation. The Japanese side's claim that there was no need for the Japanese garrison in Vietnam to be stationed in Nanning and its vicinity, expressing that the troop withdrawal was voluntary, was ridiculous. The newspaper continued that the Japanese army had withdrawn and would be surrounded on three sides by the Chinese army. The Chinese infantry had advanced along the Nanning-Binyang highway and the Nanning-Wuming highway. If the Japanese army did not withdraw, it would become "rats in a bag." It also stated that the Japanese army's withdrawal was not surprising. It was only because their strength was insufficient that they had to take this action. Otherwise, the Japanese army would never lightly abandon its war gains, so how could they abandon an important city like Nanning? The *Shishi Xinbao* stated that after Japan joined the Tripartite Pact, it had already become a tool of Hitler. However, the Japanese ambassador could not get rid of the ties in China. It was truly powerless to please its new master and was therefore eager to seek peace with China. In short, the Japanese army's withdrawal from Nanning and its peace offensive all showed the rapid weakening of Japan's power. (Associated Press dispatch on the 31st)

Liuzhou: Nanning is an important town on China's southwestern border. Its recapture has great significance. According to a military strategist, the reason for the Japanese defeat can be seen from the following factors: (1) Military factors: In recent months, the Chinese army has adopted ambush warfare and attrition warfare against the Japanese army, causing daily casualties and depletion. (2) Material factors: Due to the tight material blockade by the Chinese side and the barrenness of the southern Guangxi land, the Japanese could not obtain local supplies for their military food. Even the slightest bit of grain or wood had to come from overseas. If this was insufficient, starvation would follow. The above two factors were man-made and external. Other natural and internal factors, such as the complex terrain, the special climate, the shortage of Japanese troops, and the demoralization of morale, were also sufficient to promote the Japanese army's defeat. In short, the Japanese army's decision to withdraw from Nanning was out of necessity. In other words, it was driven away by the Chinese army and was by no means voluntary. (Dispatch on the 30th)

A Chinese military spokesperson in Chongqing announced today that the Chinese army captured several hundred people from the Japanese army when it withdrew from Nanning. One Japanese division had landed on Hainan Island via Qinzhou-Haiphong. It was said that the Japanese army abandoned Nanning entirely due to Chinese pressure. When the Japanese army entered Vietnam, the Japanese garrison in Nanning was reduced and could no longer resist the Chinese army's advance. Before attacking Nanning, the Chinese army had captured Mingjiang and Suilu on the Nanning-Longzhou highway, cutting off the Japanese army's retreat. At the same time, the central column pressed forward from Wuming and Binyang, reaching only about ten kilometers from Nanning on October 28. (Associated Press dispatch on the 31st)

Shangrao: Since the beginning of this month, fierce battles have taken place in southern Anhui, eastern Jiangxi, eastern Zhejiang, and western Zhejiang on the eastern front. The Japanese army, using mobile warfare, launched a large-scale offensive in an attempt to destroy the Chinese military bases. The Japanese first attacked southern Anhui on the 4th, but their main force was surrounded northeast of Jing County, and the Japanese offensive was immediately thwarted. The Japanese army then attacked western Zhejiang and harassed Guangde and Liyang on the border of Jiangsu and Anhui, but were also defeated by the Chinese army one by one. On the evening of the 12th, the Japanese army crossed the Fuchun River again and attacked Zhuji. Subsequently, the Japanese army in Xiaoshan also attacked Shaoxing from the east. The Chinese army then grasped the initiative and fought, inflicting blows on the Japanese army. It successively captured Zhuji and Shaoxing, and the remnants of the Japanese army retreated to Xiaoshan. So far, southern Anhui has recovered its situation four days ago. The Chinese army has also captured the Ma Dang Fortress, posing a major threat to the Japanese army. According to Japanese documents captured by the Chinese army, it is known that this was the "October Offensive," with the eastern front as the main battlefield. After a month of fighting, the Chinese army has completely crushed the Japanese "October Offensive." (Dispatch on the 30th)

Editorial

### The Confusing International Situation

The complicated and contradictory international news is pouring in, making the recent situation seem even more confusing and uncertain. Is this a period of incubation, a state of chaos due to the indecision of various parties? Or is it a deliberately created smokescreen to cover up actions before a major offensive? We should not make any hasty judgment, but we must observe carefully!

Let us begin with an example: the French Embassy in China issued a statement in Shanghai yesterday, stating that it wished to formally acknowledge on behalf of the French authorities and reiterate that all rumors regarding (1) preliminary peace talks between France and Germany, (2) the transfer of French territory, (3) France allowing Germany or Italy to use military bases, and (4) any encroachment on the sovereignty of France or its territories are pure fabrications and have no basis whatsoever. This statement will inevitably disappoint those who had hoped that the fact of the encroachment on the sovereignty of Vietnam would be openly listed as an exception. However, those who sympathize with France cannot but hope that this statement is truly consistent with reality. What we cannot help but doubt is that General Pétain met with German Führer Hitler, and Laval traveled back and forth between Vichy and Paris. Hitler then met with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and Spanish Head of State Franco before and after these events. The most sensitive inside information is kept strictly confidential, yet it is not dismissed as merely reciprocal courtesy. Moreover, the Italian newspapers' discussions of this action tacitly acknowledge the collusion between them. In that case, who can believe that what the authorities of Germany and France have touched upon is to put the past behind them, rather than to plan for the future? If France is like meat on a cutting board, how can it resist Germany? Even if France's official recognition is as such, what is the actual content of the maneuver?

Another example: Article 3 of the Tripartite Pact between Germany, Italy, and Japan is the most active, brilliant, and important provision of the alliance, stipulating that "Germany, Italy, and Japan agree to cooperate in their efforts in accordance with the above-mentioned new policies, and agree that when one of the three signatory countries is attacked by a country that is not currently participating in the European War or the Sino-Japanese War, the three countries shall provide assistance by all political, economic, and military means." In our view, it is Italy that is attacking Greece, not Greece that is attacking Italy. Therefore, Germany and Japan are not obligated to assist Italy under the alliance. However, the proclamations issued by Italy clearly point out that Greece has been helping Britain, so it has no choice but to attack Greece. Therefore, Italy can use the same wording to request assistance from Germany and Japan. However, news from Germany and Japan is extremely bizarre: there are rumors from the German side of mediating the Greco-Italian war, as if Germany, its closest ally, was not aware of Italy's attack on Greece beforehand; and it seems that on the eve of Italy's attack on Greece, Mussolini, despite his unusually warm welcome to Hitler's arrival, did not share his true intentions, so the launch of the invasion of Greece was kept secret. The Japanese side pretends to be deaf and dumb to the Greco-Italian war, as if afraid of being implicated by the alliance. Based on common sense, we believe that Germany and Japan would not immediately turn their backs on the alliance before the ink on the Tripartite Pact was even dry. Therefore, although the Tripartite Pact seems to be a unified entity on the surface, in reality there are secret agreements to cancel out the entire or at least part of the alliance. What is apparent is merely a white tiger (bluff) in an international gambling game. Of course, it is not the same as a blank piece of paper, so what exactly is the alliance tangibly colluding on?

Another example: Italy has invaded Greece, and no one can readily believe that the Soviet Union would allow its southwestern gateway, the key to the Black Sea, to be administered by Italy, and stand idly by as Greece is defeated. Turkey would willingly relinquish its European territories to Germany and Italy for "leadership" on the day the "new European order" is gradually formed, and stand idly by as Greece is defeated. Germany would like to see Italy's aggression defeated by Greece. So far, the Soviet Union, Turkey, and Germany have all expressed their neutrality in the Greco-Italian war. The Greco-Italian war will certainly not remain deadlocked for long, but for how long will the Soviet Union, Turkey, and Germany remain neutral? Britain's assistance to Greece is not only clearly expressed, but the navy and air force have already been activated, and its attitude can be described as very clear. The Soviet Union makes no affirmative statements without conditions. Germany will not assist Italy on the condition that British troops do not land in Greece. Turkey will not assist Greece on the condition that Bulgaria does not invade Greece. It seems that various parties are checking and balancing each other, while criticizing the other side for the failure of their diplomatic maneuvers. The military outcome is certainly unknowable, but what is actually expected in reality? Who is successful and who is a failure in diplomacy?

Summarizing the various tangible phenomena, it is reckless to believe that the various parties have no plans, no confidence, but are merely awaiting the development of events and only seeking to respond to changes! We are alarmed that the Far Eastern crisis nine years ago was not jointly prevented by the relevant countries, leading to the world crisis of today. Even now, they do not warn each other and are accustomed to formalistic obligations and constraints, standing idly by as the aggressors accomplish their strategy of defeating them one by one, struggling and sinking into the inevitable outcome. How many countries can withstand more than three years of war without being exhausted?

### Italian Army in Mountainous Border Region of Greece Meets Strong Resistance from Greek Forces; Greek Defense Line Remains Firm; Italian Offensive Gradually Slows; Italian War Report Claims Advance Troops Reached Kalamas River

A Reuter dispatch from Salonika, based on the latest news received here, states that the Greek front line in the Masdunia region of the Albanian border remains firmly entrenched. However, some forward outposts have been withdrawn. Italian Alpine troops are currently operating in the area, but apart from bombarding the Greek front line to ascertain its exact position, no large-scale actions have been undertaken. The Greek frontline commander has issued orders that all positions must be maintained at all costs. It is reported that an Italian unit was ambushed by a machine gun nest and suffered heavy losses. The Greek commander seized the opportunity to pursue the enemy into Albanian territory. Currently, ten captured Italian soldiers have arrived here. Over the past three days, Salonika has implemented a blackout, and anti-aircraft positions have been prepared, but no Italian aircraft have been seen attacking. Five hundred Italian residents have been detained, but German residents have not been interfered with. All types of vehicles have been requisitioned, except for trolley cars, which continue to operate. (Reuter, 21st)

According to a general headquarters communique broadcast from Rome, the momentum of the Italian offensive in Greece has slowed down. It is claimed that the Italian army in Epirus has reached the Kiljes River in various locations. However, due to adverse weather conditions and obstacles created by the retreating enemy forces, the Italian army's advance has been delayed. (Reuter, 31st)

Greek forces in Jia Ge Wei Jia, on the Yugoslav border, fiercely resisted the Italian army advancing along the Greek-Albanian front line yesterday and launched counterattacks. It is reported that the Italian army occupied several villages and towns near the front lines, but at a heavy price. Fifteen Italian aircraft, in three groups, bombed Corinth yesterday afternoon, but only one building was damaged. When Fascist troops advanced towards Piresnica, a strategic point at the junction of the Greek and Albanian fronts, 42 Italian soldiers were killed and 60 were wounded. In the same battle, 23 Greek soldiers died and 40 were wounded. Other reports indicate that after two hours of bloody fighting on Tuesday, the Italian army occupied the Greek town of Platania. Seven Greek soldiers died and twenty were wounded in this battle. The Italian army's casualties were much heavier. (United Press, 31st)

An Athens general headquarters communique states that on Wednesday, the Greek army on the Epirus front slightly retreated according to a pre-arranged plan, and then maintained its position without wavering. Greek artillery fire has hampered the Italian army's activities. The Italian air force indiscriminately bombed Patras, machine-gunned civilians, and destroyed several houses. Several undefended cities with no military significance were also bombed. A Greek aircraft that engaged enemy fighters in Albanian territory has not yet returned. (Reuter, 31st)

Naval battles between Greece and Italy have continued since the early morning of Tuesday. It is reported that Italy is adding to its forces in an attempt to make a central breakthrough towards the vital rail junction and Italy's direct target, Florina. It is widely believed that Italian aircraft will launch a lightning attack on Florina, and then strike the major city of Salonika on the Greek east coast as an additional target. While Greek troops in the mountains are repelling 10th-century Italian weaponry, and Greek guerrillas are impeding the Italian vanguard, Greek general staff personnel claim that due to heavy rains in the mountains in recent months, Italian armored vehicles and tanks have been unable to operate. However, the Italian army is using artillery to heavily bombard the area across Lake Prespa. The Greek high command acknowledges that some troops in this area have retreated to the newly built Metaxas Line. (International News Service, 31st)

The Greek government in Athens issued an official communique last night, stating that the dissemination of false information will be regarded as a hostile act endangering the nation and will be punished accordingly. According to Greek war reports, Greek forces had minor skirmishes with Italian forces in various locations on the evening of the 29th. The Italian army launched a large-scale offensive in Epirus on the 28th, supported by artillery. Greek military operations are proceeding step by step according to plan. (Haitong News Agency, 31st)

According to neutral military sources in Athens, two Italian regiments launched heavy artillery and air strikes yesterday, advancing in a pincer formation in the northwestern area of the Greek-Albanian border, and occupied the strategically important town of Ioannina. It is reported that Greek forces fought fiercely to resist, and the fighting was exceptionally intense, with heavy casualties on both sides. (International News Agency, 31st)

It is also reported that the Italian army occupied Breshnica for a day and a half, which is the gateway to the road to Salonika. (International News Service, 31st) According to a Washington dispatch from Salonika in this morning's "Vileum Report" in the Southern Capital, Italian troops have now reached St. Nikolas, 56 kilometers from the Greek-Albanian border. Another report from the city of Dragost states that the sounds of Italian aircraft and artillery fire could be heard all day yesterday. The Yugoslav-Albanian border remains open, with vehicles passing freely, but the Yugoslav-Greek border has been closed. (Haitong News Agency, 21st)

An air raid warning was issued here in Athens at 4:20 p.m. yesterday, lasting for half an hour before ending. No artillery fire was heard.

According to official sources, 200 people were killed and 280 were injured in the bombing of Patras. (Reuter, 31st)

### Greek Prime Minister Encourages Army to Defend Sacred Homeland

General Metaxas, the Prime Minister of the Athens Cabinet, recently issued a message to the army soldiers, stating that the sacred land of the motherland is now being defended by your iron chests. I have boundless respect for you and firmly believe that everyone from the King to the common people is proud of you. You now have an extremely glorious opportunity to leave your name in history, alongside the heroes of the Battle of Marathon (in 490 BC, the Greeks defeated the Persians at the town of Marathon), the War of Independence in 1821, and other victorious wars. You must strive to do your best. (Havas, 30th)

At the outbreak of the Italian-Greek war, Greece had four army corps, including thirteen infantry divisions and one cavalry division. The Greek army is particularly well-suited for mountain warfare. The Greek air force has 300 aircraft. The organization of the Greek army has recently been improved, and it is equipped with new weapons. Its senior generals are heavily influenced by French military strategy. Its basic principle is defense. (Haitong News Agency, 31st)

### Reports Say Greek Army Launches Large-Scale Counteroffensive, Occupies Several Locations in Albania

Reports from Athens state that under the cover of three light bombers, the Greek army has seized several Italian border outposts in Albania in a surprising large-scale counteroffensive. Although the Italian general offensive on the Albanian border seems to have been thwarted, Italian bombers are flying back and forth over Greece to carry out attacks. The port of Patras was bombed five times yesterday. Battlefield news states that there was a surprising assault on a northwestern, irregular line between Florina and Ioannina yesterday. However, it is reported that Italian reinforcements are approaching the main Greek defense line in a certain location in the extreme west. The Greek high command is moving the main force of 400,000 troops to that location to address this threat. (International News Agency, 31st)

Yesterday afternoon, three Greek bombers used machine guns to strafe low-flying Italian troops who were assisting in the offensive in the western sector of the northern battlefield, dispersing the Italian troops. All three Greek aircraft returned to their original positions, but one aircraft was hit by gunfire, and one pilot was seriously injured. According to news from here, although the Italian army is numerous, most of them are stationed on the front lines of the Greek border. Patras was bombed five times again yesterday, but only one person was injured because most of the residents had evacuated to other places after the air raid on Sunday. It is known here that Britain is currently trying to fulfill its promise of financial assistance. (Reuter, 31st)

### Italian Army Attacks Greece in Two Routes; Fierce Fighting Occurs in Florina

According to authoritative British sources in the Swedish capital, regarding the situation in Greece, the Italian army is currently attacking on two fronts. One Italian army is advancing from Kakavia with Volos on the Aegean Sea as its final destination, and the other army is advancing from Korçë, aiming for Salonika. It is reported that fierce fighting took place between Greek and Italian forces in Florina yesterday. Patras was bombed five times yesterday, with many casualties. An alert was issued in Athens for thirty minutes yesterday, but details are not known. (Haitong News Agency, 31st)

Yesterday, the Italian Army General Headquarters in Rome declared that the Italian army had crossed the Albanian border and advanced more than 50 miles into Greece. According to the communique, the Italian army is advancing steadily on all fronts despite strong resistance from Greek mountain troops. At the same time, the official war report states that three large Italian armies on the central front have already occupied Florina, the "Northern Fortress" of Greece, and their vanguard has advanced eastwards along the main road, heading towards Salonika. Florina is an important rail junction. Unofficial sources here acknowledge that Greek forces put up a fierce fight to defend the city. Salonika, a large city on the eastern coast, is also the destination of the Italian army's subsequent southeastward advance. The communique states that Italian forces are gradually increasing in strength and intensifying their attack, so Greek forces are unable to withstand the pressure and are currently fighting a rearguard action to allow sufficient time to consolidate their main defense line between Konitsa and Salonika. (International News Service, 31st)

### British Lay Mines in Aegean Sea, Blocking Entrance to Gulf of Corinth

The Admiralty in London announced yesterday that mines laid by the British Navy have blocked both ends of the entrance to the Gulf of Corinth in the Aegean Sea. Naval authorities stated that a protective net has been spread across the Isthmus of Corinth, the only land bridge between the Peloponnese and northern Greece. The isthmus and the Corinth Canal are extremely important to Greece, so Italy may launch a surprise landing or bombard the area from the sea. The islands of Corfu are not included in this protective net because, apart from serving as naval bases, they are not important. News of British air raids on the Dodecanese area was received here last night. It is reported that the Italian airfield at Maritsa was bombed three times. The news states that the transportation station, hangars, and more than a dozen aircraft were destroyed. It is also reported that the Italian airfield at Gadurra was bombed twice, and the oil depot at the Liberta airfield was burned down. In a statement last night, naval authorities stated that the Italian Navy attempted to damage ships in the Port of Rhodes but was unsuccessful. (United Press, 31st)

An article by a famous wartime writer, "Pless," in the London Daily Mail, argues that Britain should occupy all important Greek islands and turn them into launching points in the Aegean Sea. He says that this is the best time for General Wavell, the British Commander-in-Chief in the Middle East, to launch an attack, and that the western desert of Egypt is the best battlefield for the Greek campaign. (Reuter, 31st)

People in London today are eager to hear news of Britain giving strong and effective assistance to Greece. British commentators also argue that the British navy and air force should seize this opportunity and adopt a swift offensive with the "spirit of the Battle of Narsus." Londoners believe that the most important fact of the second day of the Greek war is that the Greeks were able to deploy their troops for a major defense without being seriously hindered by Italy. However, there has been no confirmation to date of news that Britain has landed on or occupied various islands in Greece. (United Press, 31st)

According to a dispatch from Istanbul carried in the Daily Mail today, large detachments of British Royal Marines have landed on an island south of Corfu. (International News Agency, 20th)

### Trade and Business Giants Discuss Principles of Political Action; Continue War Against England Until Victory; Reorganize European Life Through Gradual Methods

Rome: According to a foreign affairs correspondent from the Italian Stefani News Agency, the results of the meeting between Hitler and Mussolini in Florence will become a complete agreement on future German and Italian political action. The main points are as follows: (1) The war against England will continue until victory, so that Europe can be freed from England's intolerable domination. (2) The Axis powers will reorganize European life through gradual methods and eliminate the chaos created by the Treaty of Versailles. This new order will be realized after England's influence on the European continent is completely eliminated. (3) Germany and Italy have reached a consensus on all aspects of opinion, regarding both European and non-European issues. Hitler's recent talks in Western Europe are part of this cooperation. (4) If France can cooperate in building Europe and change its attitude towards the Axis powers, its situation can also be improved. (5) In the past, Greece allowed the Central Powers to use it to fight against the Axis powers, and at the same time, it used its neutral position to reap the benefits. Today, Greece must know that anyone who helps England is the enemy of the Axis powers. (Reuter, 31st)

### German-Italian Diplomatic Activities Have Not Yet Reached Conclusion

Berlin: Regarding the talks between Head of State Hitler and Marshal Pétain, General Franco, and Mussolini, a German Foreign Ministry spokesman said that German-Italian diplomatic activities are not yet complete. The military actions of the Axis powers have not weakened anywhere, and their diplomatic offensive will be carried out with the utmost determination in their foreign political war. Regarding the talks between Hitler and Marshal Pétain, it has been learned here that no formal agreement or formal solution has been reached. The discussion only focused on the main issues of France's future position in Europe. The basis of this discussion is that France, having initiated the war and then been defeated, should naturally pay the price of the war. The responsible authorities in France have now also recognized this fact, knowing that France collapsed due to the policies it adopted in the past. Berlin officials know that this point is most important and should be understood by both sides, and it is a prerequisite for the future development of political events. Only in this way can it be beneficial to the future of Europe. When asked about the mission of Spanish Army Minister General Davila to Africa, the German spokesman said that Berlin has not received any notification about this matter, but there is no doubt that the African trip of the Army Minister must be to implement the spirit of the talks between Hitler and Franco. When a reporter asked about the impact of the Italian-Greek war on the neighboring countries, the spokesman said that Berlin has not received any information that proves that any disputes have occurred outside of Greece. (Haitong News Agency, 31st)

### Pétain's Broadcast Speech Expresses Cooperation with Germany

London: General Pétain personally delivered a speech last night from the Lyon Radio Station about his meeting with Hitler, saying that he went to the meeting of his own accord and entered the path of cooperation freely, without any pressure. The French people have the dignity to face their difficulties and the great effort to revive their country, which made this meeting possible. I accept the principle of cooperation between the two countries, and the implementation methods will be discussed later. I believe that the first responsibility of the French people is to trust that in the near future, the suffering of our country can be reduced, the situation of our prisoners can be improved, the burden of our occupied forces' food and supplies can be reduced, the borders can be more fixed, and the government can facilitate the adjustment of local people's food. This kind of cooperation must be sincere and free of aggressive ideas. France has various obligations to the victor, but it still maintains its sovereignty. The cabinet members are responsible to me alone. I spoke to the public as an elder before, but today, I announce to the public as a leader. I hope that the people of the country will listen to my words. (Reuter, 31st)

### Hitler Conducts Appeasement Work on Germany and Italy

Sulek: From the news coming from Berlin and Rome, recent developments have forced Hitler to become an "appeaser." However, it remains doubtful whether Hitler's "appeasement" method will have better results than last year's appeasement. Hitler first tried to persuade Italy to sacrifice its territorial claims to France, but this attempt was quickly abandoned, and Italy opposed giving France any positive or negative assistance in the war, because Mussolini was deeply afraid that if France received this assistance, it would be able to be on an equal footing with Italy in Germany's "new order." Hitler then hastily went to Florence, Italy, and the German newspapers published comforting comments to Italy, such as the Berlin Stock Exchange Daily stating that although Germany allowed France to participate in the Axis system after severing ties with England, Germany has not made any promises regarding future peace. The Italian newspapers finally felt relieved at this point. From this, the following conclusions can be drawn: (1) Germany's new proposal to France is more generous than the original proposal. (2) The temporary peaceful measures will be modified in the future to satisfy Italy's wishes. France has no guarantee of this. (3) The position of French negotiations depends on England's resistance, so the implementation methods of the Franco-German agreement may not be as smooth as originally expected when the details are discussed in the future. (Haitong News Agency, 31st)

London: A Berlin dispatch from the Italian official news agency reflects Italy's concern about Hitler's attempts to conclude a deal with the Vichy government. The dispatch stated that Italy has effectively opposed any Franco-German compromise that would sacrifice the results of Italy's victory in exchange for French anti-British action, and it said that according to responsible German sources, the talks between Hitler and Pétain, Laval, not only did not establish a formal agreement, nor did it discuss special issues, what was discussed was only the general plan for France to work on after the Axis countries win. The dispatch also stated that the new European domination must take into account that France, which initiated the war, ultimately failed, so France must pay the full price. On this point, it is not possible to discuss with those who are currently in charge of French policy. (Reuter, 31st)

### Italy Will Never Give Up Its Legitimate Demands on France

Rome: It was recognized to reporters here yesterday that the news about Italy giving up or reducing its demands on France at the Florence meeting was incorrect. It is claimed that Italy has not given up an inch of its legitimate demands, and Germany also agrees with this attitude. However, the meaning of Italy's demands has not been announced. (Haitong News Agency, 31st)

### America Will Use Over 20,000 Aircraft to Assist Britain: Roosevelt Announces Completion of All Procedures in Boston Speech

Boston – President Roosevelt delivered a speech here last night, announcing that he has completed all procedures to transport another batch of 26,000 military aircraft to Britain. The President stated, "Our nation's factories possess such great productivity that it will make our country the strongest air power in the world." President Roosevelt also announced that he has approved providing Britain with all necessary military supplies, such as allowing Britain to order cannons, machine guns, rifles, tanks, and other munitions from the United States. He also defended the U.S. rearmament program and declared that American youth would not be sent to participate in the European war. President Roosevelt, when discussing the matter of aiding Britain with aircraft, stated that a large production volume is of great importance in maintaining air power. He said that after three months of the aerial blitz, the British Royal Air Force is now even stronger than when the war broke out. He attributed the success of the British Air Force to American assistance. The President, when discussing the satisfactory gains of the U.S. rearmament program, stated, "Within seven years, we will have increased the number of ships in the U.S. Navy from 198 to 337, with another 119 under construction. Since the invasion of Poland, we have more than doubled our country's army. Combining the National Guard that has already been mobilized, the number of men currently in service has reached 436,000. The National Defense Committee is now completing all preparations at an extraordinary rate. Military manufacturing contracts related to national defense that have been signed are valued at a total of 30 billion U.S. dollars." The President finally added that some people criticize the government for not being able to provide adequate accommodation for all the enlisted men, stating that this is inconsistent with the facts and should not be said by a patriotic citizen. He also explained that by January 5th of next year, facilities sufficient to accommodate 930,000 soldiers will be completed. (United Press report, 31st)

Boston – President Roosevelt broadcasted today, stating that the United States has increased aircraft engine production by 2.4% in the past October. We are determined to reach an annual production of 50,000 aircraft and are rapidly advancing towards this goal. The Boeing factory now produces four times more than a year ago, while the Curtiss factory has increased production twelvefold. Since taking office, the current government has been committed to building a large navy. The number of workers in naval shipyards is now six times greater than in 1933, and the effectiveness of naval bases has also been greatly expanded. Since the invasion of Poland, we have increased the standing army by more than double. In the three months since Germany began its blitz strategy, the British Air Force is stronger than at the start of the war, partly due to American supplies. The most glorious fact in the world today is that democracy exists unscathed and is growing stronger. (Reuters report, 31st)

### Military Situation in the Mediterranean: 70 German Divisions Concentrated, Hungary and Bulgaria Under Pressure

London – Reuters military correspondent reports that the opposing forces in the Mediterranean theater are widely dispersed, creating a confusing and unpredictable situation. When Italy declared war, it was expected that they would immediately attack from the Albanian border in coordination with the actions of Italian forces in North Africa, overwhelming the British Navy. However, while the Italian forces in Libya and Albania have undoubtedly made preparations, large-scale battles on both fronts have not yet materialized. According to reports from Libya, the Italian side is busy building roads in Sidi Barrani, but there are no signs of an impending offensive on land or in the air. According to reports from Albania, Italy's best opportunity would have been to launch an attack immediately before Greece could fully mobilize. However, a large army advancing deep into Salonika would have a long supply line and, surrounded by anti-Italian Albanians, would risk being attacked from the rear. Perhaps this is why they have not dared to take the risk of a hasty advance. What is truly difficult to understand is the appearance of 70 German divisions near the Balkan Peninsula. Many divisions are concentrated on the borders of Hungary and Bulgaria, while mechanized units are stationed in towns along the border of German-held Carinthia. These 70 divisions number at least one million troops. What is Germany trying to achieve by assembling such a massive force? The number of German troops in Romania is quite small, so Turkey is not Germany's immediate target, at least for now. The situation in Bulgaria is different because Germany's military actions everywhere exert pressure on Bulgaria, and the Bulgaria army is in a difficult position. Hungary and Bulgaria are even more easily drawn in. It is expected that these two countries will obey Germany's orders. Now that relations between the Soviet Union and Turkey are improving daily, the question arises: Does the Soviet Union have any concerns about Germany's intentions? Geography will be an important factor in the development of the Balkans. Hungary is flat, while Bulgaria is mountainous. If Italy wants to attack Greece, it can only advance eastward towards Salonika or southward towards the Gulf of Corinth. Salonika is bound to become a major objective because it is one of Bulgaria's most important trade outlets and has significant military value. However, regardless of Italy's actions, these 70 German divisions cannot be ignored because they can advance through Hungary and Romania towards Bulgaria or drive from Ukraine into southern Soviet Union to seize its oil. Although none of these speculations show signs of materializing, they are all possibilities. Finally, the climate is also an important factor. The mountains in Greece are covered in deep snow, and other parts of the Balkans are cold and damp. Germany may now consider repeating its victory in the invasion of Norway, but it is more likely that Germany will wait until next spring due to the unfavorable weather conditions.

### Soviet Red Star Newspaper Comments on the Italian-Greek War, Saying It May Be Protracted

Moscow – The Soviet Army newspaper Red Star today commented on the military aspects of the Italian-Greek war, believing that the war may be protracted. The newspaper stated, "Greece's position in the eastern Mediterranean is very close to the British fleet, and it will certainly receive a large amount of British aid because Britain must try to defend this favorable base." The article continued, "British supplies will be transported through Piraeus, Volos, and Salonika, forcing Italy to maintain neutrality at its base in the Dodecanese. The lack of a base in Albania will hinder the reinforcement of large Italian forces. As long as the British Air Force is within Greek territory, it will threaten the Italian air bases in the southeast. Under these circumstances, the battles on the Albanian-Greek front will not be easily resolved in the short term." Soviet newspapers today continue to report on the Italian-Greek war with extensive coverage, but the government remains silent on the Balkan events. (United Press report, 31st)

### Rumors of a Ceasefire Between Italy and Greece

Sofia – According to unconfirmed reports circulating here yesterday, Italy and Greece may soon cease hostilities because Germany is said to be using Turkey and other Greek neighbors to pressure Greece. According to the reports, if Italy withdraws its attacks on Greece, Greece may hand over some naval bases to Italy, and Italy and Greece will immediately declare a truce. (United Press report, 31st)

Berlin – According to authoritative sources here yesterday, they have not received the rumors from Sofia that Italy and Greece will soon cease hostilities due to German pressure. (United Press report, 31st)

A Painful History of the European War (1)

### The Beginning and End of the Franco-British Split

Since this newspaper began translating and publishing "European War Miscellany" on the anniversary of the start of the European war on September 1st, two months have passed in a flash. During this time, everything related to military affairs, politics, public sentiment, and even anecdotes and trivial news has been included, but there are still many articles that have not been published. Now, this newspaper has continuously collected many rich materials, all written by first-class British, French, and American writers who participated in confidential matters or experienced the events firsthand. What is described is entirely the historical truth of why British and French politics and military affairs deteriorated to this point, and it is revealed in great detail. The editor, based on the idea of "learning from the past to guide the future," is translating and recording in advance, naming it "A Painful History of the European War." After readers get a complete picture, they will surely realize that the inability of Britain and France to rally in the beginning was simply due to indecision and too late preparation. The first article, "The Beginning and End of the Franco-British Split," was written by the famous French historian and biographer Andre Maurois, and the original was published in the American "Collier's" weekly. As for the remaining manuscripts of "European War Miscellany" that have been put aside, they will continue to be published in the future.

The following is a translation of "The Beginning and End of the Franco-British Split":

Since the beginning of the European war in September 1939, German propaganda has aimed at dividing the Franco-British alliance. For eight months, the French heard every day that France was dragged into the whirlpool of war by Britain; the British themselves did not fight and had never fought a battle; the British only supplied weapons, while the French served as cannon fodder. They also distributed many pictures to the French side, depicting British soldiers pushing French soldiers into a "pool of blood," or British officers playing with semi-nude women in Paris while French soldiers kept watch day and night on the Maginot Line. By June 1940, German propaganda had achieved great success, not only separating Britain and France, but also turning them into enemies. What was the reason?

First, the French had deep-rooted prejudices, which made this propaganda more effective. Long before Germany, Britain was France's historical enemy, and the French still remember this old feud. I have spoken extensively about Franco-British friendship in many provinces, but I was always embarrassed by the unresolved hatred left by the Hundred Years' War. Of course, the late French Foreign Minister Delcassé worked hard to reconcile the two countries in 1904 and establish a consultative relationship; of course, American troops fought alongside French troops from 1914 to 1918; of course, one million British soldiers lie buried in the northern part of France; but since the end of the last European war, misunderstandings between the two countries have continued to arise. Britain feared that France would become too powerful, so it sided with Germany to rearm, and this one wrong decision ultimately left endless troubles.

Around 1930, British Ambassador to France Lord Tyrrell said to me: "Since the end of the European war, Britain has made two major mistakes: First, the British believed that France, after its victory, had become Germanized; second, the British believed that Germany, after some changes, had become Britishized."

In 1936, when German troops tore up the Locarno Treaty and reoccupied the Rhineland, British public opinion was still intoxicated with pacifism and refused to assist France.

At that time, a certain important figure in the British political world said to me: "The Germans can do whatever they want in their own garden. Why should we care?" Another said: "You oppose us British only because we are not loyal Frenchmen." But that was not the case. I opposed the British at the time because they were not loyal Britishmen. They did not know that after Germany rearmed, it posed a great military threat to both Britain and France!

My admiration for the British people has been longstanding. During the last European war, I was stationed in the British army as a liaison officer. From my own experience, Britain can certainly be trusted to abide by the treaties it signs. Once the country is in a critical situation, it will take violent actions like any other country, but it can be said that it is definitely not out of malice.

A country is like an individual, and its brutal behavior is actually caused by a sense of inferiority. Britain has no sense of inferiority; on the contrary, it is the opposite. For nine hundred years, Britain's national fortune has been prosperous, which has cultivated an unshakable optimism. Britain does not fight until it has to, and it wins every battle. Therefore, it no longer thinks about the possibility of failure and its terrible consequences. Since the end of the last European war, what the British have hoped for is nothing more than to enjoy the pleasures of the countryside and live their accustomed lives; they have turned a deaf ear to the issue of armaments and war. What British professors have taught young people is that war is the legacy of barbarism and is not difficult to eliminate. Unfortunately, they have not noticed that if justice is not backed by force, evil will prevail.

Britain also has a mistaken illusion that it overvalues the League of Nations, believing that educational arguments can subdue cannons. This kind of ideological confusion, overconfidence, and disregard for reality was bound to cause trouble, as discerning people had long expected. From 1919 to 1939, Britain always enjoyed itself on its green lawns at home. It suddenly woke up after the Munich Conference, but it was too late. Finally, it rose up to fight empty-handed.

This is the second key to the success of German propaganda. They kept nagging in the ears of the French! "Britain has no troops to fight and will make France fight to the last man!" This was somewhat believable. Britain's navy is certainly unmatched in the world, and its air force is also excellent, but on land, the number of British troops and their armaments are insufficient. On a long battle line, they can only guard a short section.

Many French people asked me with sarcasm: "British soldiers? Where are the British soldiers? Are there really British soldiers in France?"

Even so, if Britain could have quickly caught up and formed several divisions after the declaration of war, the French might have turned to trust them. However, the British, whether in nature or in principle, are known for their slowness, which was particularly evident in this war. The trade union refused to cancel the restrictions on working hours, and this situation did not improve until several months later, after trade union representatives were included in the cabinet. Large merchants worried about not being able to maintain foreign markets, and the quantity of goods to be ordered from the United States and Canada was insufficient. Aircraft manufacturing was not successful until the industrial tycoon Lord Beaverbrook came forward to take charge. In March 1940, British experts still disagreed on the design of mass-produced tanks, and French Minister of Armaments Raoul Dautry was surprised to hear this. Commander Piller of the French Northern Army also complained to me: "British soldiers? I know they have excellent qualities. Their soldiers can indeed hold their ground, and their generals are indeed very experienced in combat, but they are unbelievably slow! It has been eight months since the war started, and they only have ten divisions! Based on their conscription quota alone, they should have formed at least thirty divisions! But they are too detailed and too fond of nitpicking. The Germans know the importance of time."

Colonel Teillard, chief of staff of the French liaison mission in the British army, also worriedly said: "I still cannot get accurate information about the number of troops that Britain plans to send to France in the coming months. Sometimes they tell me that four divisions can be sent out before October, and sometimes they say that there will only be one division. Sometimes they plan to form a second army corps, and then they cancel it. In any case, there is not much hope this summer, which is so distressing."

But in April 1940, German propaganda had not yet reached its goal. There were indeed many anti-British people in France, but the general staffs of Britain and France were very sincere to each other, even more so than in 1914. There was also no separation between the naval headquarters of the two countries; the British Admiralty could tell the French Admiralty about all new inventions, and the French Admiralty could provide the British Admiralty with all files for reference.

### London's Air Defense Strengthened: German Aircraft Raids Thwarted, Liverpool and Other Places Attacked

London – This morning, London's new anti-aircraft artillery once again thwarted the German aircraft trying to raid England, preventing them from flying into the capital to bomb. The anti-aircraft fire net along the southeast coast of England reached a width of ten miles, greatly alarming the raiders. Most of the bombers were driven back, and some even dropped their bombs in the fields and fled. When the air raid alarm started, there was light anti-aircraft fire and the sound of aircraft soaring, coming from far away beyond the clouds. For several hours before midnight, there was a long pause over London, and no anti-aircraft fire was heard. It was heard that early in the evening, six German aircraft invaded the London area. Although the skies over London were very quiet, German aircraft were quite active in other parts of Britain. Southeast England and a coastal village were reported to have been attacked by German aircraft dropping incendiary bombs and oil bombs. A town northwest of Liverpool was attacked at 7 p.m. (United Press report, 31st)

London – During the day yesterday, enemy aircraft tried to launch an attack under the cover of dense clouds in the southeast coastal areas. British fighter planes waited for them to come and intercepted them head-on. The enemy aircraft scattered and were forced to retreat. (Reuters report, 31st)

### Gibraltar Ship Attacked But Missed: Italian Torpedo Fails

Gibraltar – The naval authorities here issued a bulletin last night, stating regarding the mysterious attack on ships in Gibraltar that on Wednesday morning, the Italian navy launched a torpedo attack on ships in the harbor. "The torpedo exploded in the harbor and did no damage. Another torpedo shot to the Spanish shore." (Reuters report, 31st)

Gibraltar – Officials here revealed yesterday that the Italian side had used some "special invention" in an attempt to bomb British ships in the port of Gibraltar with torpedoes, but their plan had failed. All torpedoes fired exploded on the coast, and no British ships were injured. Since the outbreak of the Greek-Italian war, the strength of the British naval detachment in Gibraltar has been strengthened due to the increase in the number of ships. (International News Agency report, 30th)

### German War Report

Berlin – This afternoon's German war report stated that our aircraft continued to bomb military targets in London, the Midlands, and western England in retaliation. The aircraft factory near Sheffield was hit and severely damaged. Our aircraft sank an enemy merchant ship of 5,000 tons 300 kilometers west of Ireland. In the air battles that took place yesterday, the German air force was superior. Last night, our aircraft attacked London fiercely, and many places along the Thames River were hit and caught fire. Many docks and port facilities were destroyed. Enemy speedboats tried to approach the coast of Flanders using dense fog, but were repelled by our naval artillery fire. Last night, enemy aircraft invaded the western border area of Germany and carried out indiscriminate bombing. Yesterday, the enemy lost thirteen aircraft, and five of our aircraft went missing. (Haitong News Agency report, 31st)

### Italian Libya Suffers Air Raids

Cairo – Recently, strong southerly winds have stirred up sandstorms, which is common at this time of year. As a result, the Italian army in the western desert is facing a new danger. Mechanized vehicles will also be unable to move due to these sandstorms because the sand will cause the engines to overheat, and the drivers of tanks, armored vehicles, and transport vehicles will be forced to stop every fifteen minutes. Aircraft can still fly because the sandstorms only reach a height of 150 feet, but some believe that land-based mechanical operations, even on a very small scale, are impossible while the sandstorms continue to blow. (Reuters report, 31st)

Cairo – Last night, a British military bulletin was issued here, announcing that British aircraft had carried out extensive attacks on military targets in Italian Libya. Derna was bombed, and ships were believed to have been heavily damaged. The naval barracks in Tobruk were also bombed. Soluch and Giazira were attacked and set on fire. Menastir was also bombed, and one bomb hit an aircraft on the ground. British aircraft also conducted many reconnaissance flights and all returned safely. (Reuters report, 31st)

### British Cargo Ship Sunk

Berlin – A British cargo ship of 5,000 tons was sunk in the Atlantic Ocean yesterday morning by a German aircraft. Although the weather was bad and there were dense clouds, the German aircraft flew low twice and dropped several bombs. The ship was severely damaged and sank immediately. (Haitong News Agency report, 31st)

### British Planes Brave Terrible Weather to Bomb German Industrial Centers: Main Targets Were Refineries and Oil Storage Facilities

London, Tuesday Night: When British planes attacked Germany, the weather was extremely bad. However, the British planes were not deterred, and the bombing of Berlin and many military and industrial targets was even more intense. The main targets were oil supply centers and refineries and storage facilities, such as those in Magdeburg, Hamborn, and Lunen. Factories in Leipzig and the Krupp factory in Essen were attacked again. A bridge at the port of Stralsund on the Baltic Sea was also hit by a bomb. Other British planes failed to find their intended targets and flew to the Ruhr area and its northern and eastern regions, heavily bombing railway junctions, disrupting transportation between the industrialized west and the rest of Germany. A large fire broke out at a freight yard in Munster within ten minutes of being attacked. Twenty-nine airfields were bombed, fourteen of which caught fire and burned. British planes heavily attacked the refinery areas of Hamborn and Stuttgart, with flames soaring where bombs fell. During the attack on Magdeburg, the explosion of a bomb hitting an oil factory was so powerful that it greatly shook the British planes overhead, and flames shot into the sky in an instant. Hamburg, which had been heavily bombed on Monday night, and the Bremen shipyards and Wilhelmshaven naval base were attacked again, with British planes successively dropping large bombs and incendiary bombs, which exploded in the shipyards. However, due to low clouds and ground fog in much of northwestern Germany, the extent of the damage to the shipyards was unclear. The British air strikes on German railway transport hubs were extensive, with freight yards in Cologne, Hamburg, and Krefeld, and railway junctions in Osnabrück and other places, being heavily bombed. The British plane that started the fire at the Munster freight yard encountered intense anti-aircraft fire, and its wings and fuselage were hit by shell fragments in several places. In an airfield in the Rhine area, a large bomb caused two extremely large explosions, with debris flying into the sky. The shipyards and ships in the ports of Ijmuiden, Vlissingen, and Dunkirk were bombed again by British planes, with large fires breaking out in all except Ijmuiden. The difficulties of British air strikes on Berlin were recently detailed by the pilots who participated in the attacks. The attack took place very early. The first wave of bombers reached Berlin at 8:00 PM. At that time, there was a heavy snowstorm, and it was extremely difficult to find targets. The British planes dropped flares to locate targets and dropped large bombs, but due to the heavy snowfall, the results of the bombing were not very clear. The pilot of the first British plane to reach Berlin said that after takeoff, the weather was clear, the visibility was clear, the sky was cloudless, and the stars were shining. Before long, the weather suddenly changed, with a snowstorm blowing. Snowflakes also flew into the cockpit, and the windshield was completely covered by snow, so he had to rely on instruments for blind flight for a long time. At that time, he still hoped to get out of the snowstorm area before reaching Berlin, but the snowstorm became even worse. However, he still braved the snow to find a target, which was a large power plant, and bombed it. On the way back, he did not leave the snowstorm area until he had flown most of the journey. Another pilot who attacked the outskirts of Berlin said that he also encountered a blizzard, and snow flew into the cockpit. At one point, he was covered in snow and almost became a snowman in flight. When he first encountered the snowstorm, he flew higher, hoping that flying would be easier, but the controls froze, so he lowered his flight and flew at a rate of 2,000 feet per minute for 35 minutes. At one point, he flew into a dense anti-aircraft fire net, but was not injured. Another British bomber was approaching Berlin when it froze due to flying extremely high and spiraled down. The pilot threw down the bombs to reduce the weight of the aircraft, but the aircraft continued to spiral down, so he urgently warned the crew to prepare to bail out. The pilot was only able to control the aircraft when it was about to touch the ground, and then ascended and escaped. (Reuters, 31st)

London: Reliable sources say that Italy is planning to establish an autonomous Macedonian state, which includes parts of Yugoslavia, Greece, and Bulgaria, and is under Italian protection. Another source said that this country will be constitutionally linked to Albania. Well-informed sources say that if Italy occupies the provinces of Salonika and Macedonia in Greece, this plan may be realized. Most of the land of this new Macedonian state will be taken from Yugoslavia, and a smaller portion will be taken from Greece. In addition, Bulgaria will also cede one-tenth of its land to the new country. Moreover, Yugoslavia, considering that Salonika is an important commercial outlet for the country, would in effect be placing Yugoslavia's commerce in mortal danger if Italy occupied Salonika. However, Yugoslavia, fearing German aggression, dares not resolutely send troops to protect Salonika. (United Press, 31st)

Washington: Reliable officials said today that the Philippine constitutional amendment could be submitted to President Roosevelt around November 10.

### Grain; 8,700 Tons of Foreign Rice Arrive; Rice Accounts for Three-Quarters, Corn Only One-Quarter

Large quantities of foreign rice continue to arrive in Shanghai. The French company's "Songtai" vessel, directly transporting grain from Saigon, was reported yesterday. It is now known that the vessel arrived at the port at noon yesterday, docking at the Gonghexiang Wharf in Hongkou, carrying 66,806 bags of foreign rice and 20,323 bags of corn, totaling 8,700 tons. (Zu)

Yesterday, the foreign rice market saw prices rise due to newly fixed prices abroad. No. 2 Saigon merchants quoted 72 yuan and 71.5 yuan, with 450 tons newly transacted, also agreed upon at 71.5 yuan. Furthermore, the actual quantity of rice arriving recently includes a mix of corn, not as large as rumored in the market. Therefore, those who needed to lose money in the Shanghai rice market before the month, the owners steadfastly refused to sell, and floating more new hoarding took the opportunity to absorb it. Although the actual sales households on this street are offering the average price of rice today, they are not intending to sell briskly, but they are also taking advantage of the low prices to slightly add to their holdings. The market is gradually consolidating, and as a result, the prices of various grades of rice have generally risen by nearly one yuan compared to the previous evening. Reclaimed original bags have reached a spot price of 73 yuan to 74.2 yuan, and November shipments are 71.5 yuan, generally about one yuan higher than the previous market. The total daily transaction volume was 400-500 tons of original bags, and 12,000 bags of spot rice.

New japonica rice and kiln-seed wild rice, etc., continued to arrive at 1,000 to 2,000 shi. On the sales side, seeing the brisk foreign rice market, the situation also tightened. The selling price of new japonica increased by 40 to 50 cents, opening at 77.5 yuan per original bag, and 72.5 yuan and 71 yuan per dan. Kiln-seed also increased by about one yuan, opening at 76 yuan. However, with the sudden surge in the arrival of wild rice, the market became stable, remaining at 79 yuan to 76.8 yuan. The situation for Duyang japonica was similar, with no opening for broken-stem. Both domestic and foreign glutinous rice were slightly more popular and also tighter in color, with Yili and Te Yuan opening at 76 yuan and 75.5 yuan, Changdanbai Yuan at 74.5 yuan, Hong Kong Te Yuan at 73 yuan, and secondary grades down to 69 yuan.

### The Tense Situation of Flour; Gradually Disappearing; The Wheat Market Becomes More Sluggish

The current flour market situation shows an increasing supply, because since the Chinese mills have increased their batch releases, the street's needs are quite abundant, and the tense situation has long since disappeared invisibly. Under this environment, the number of reclaimed goods flowing out is also gradually increasing, while hoarders are at a loss, and actual sales are observing, resulting in a situation where supply exceeds demand. The price of old-car reclaimed flour is only 18.5 yuan plus fees, and the domestic Shanlu brand is the same price. Yamamoto Street handled 200 to 300 bags. As for foreign flour, with foreign orders arriving soon and prices very reasonable, people's hearts are weakened, and few are entering the market. There were no formal transactions throughout the day.

Wheat transactions are dull and stagnant day after day. Both domestic and foreign arrivals are scarce. Only occasional shipments of a few dozen or hundred bags arrive from nearby areas, all of which are directly delivered to Japanese factories. The market has long been unable to purchase any, and the market is also rarely prosperous. As for transactions in Chinese factories, they are even more quiet.

### Oilseed Cake; The Oil Market Resumes Its Rising Trend

Yesterday's oil market was sluggish in the morning, but after small Hong Kong dealers continued to inquire, people's hearts inevitably turned active from the continuous sluggish situation. In the afternoon, there were also reports that Hanyun had also inquired, and futures oil first rose. At the tightest time, it had risen by more than three yuan compared to the previous day, but before closing, it fell back by one yuan because the Qingdao market had not yet reported. As a result, spot oil rose by one yuan, and futures oil rose by two yuan. Soybean oil sales were rare, with 50 pieces of Jiaozhou soybean oil transacted at a price of 75 yuan, 50 pieces of Yanchi soybean oil at a price of 77 yuan, and 200 dan of Dayouyu factory soybean oil at a price of 83 yuan to 5 jiao. A total of 300 pieces of Jiaozhou peanut oil were transacted at a price of 68.5 yuan to 69 yuan, and 50 pieces for delivery in two weeks were also priced at 69 yuan. More than 100 barrels of Qingdao oil were priced at 90.5 yuan, rising directly to 98 yuan. 150 barrels for delivery in November were priced at 96.5 yuan to 7 yuan. 600 barrels for delivery in late November were priced at 96.5 yuan, rising to 99.75 yuan, and then falling back to 98.25 yuan. Over 500 barrels for delivery in late December were priced at 98 yuan to 101 yuan, closing at 100 yuan. Also, 500 cans of Qingdao canned oil were priced at 95.5 yuan, and 2,000 cans of Yantai canned oil were priced at 97 yuan and 98 yuan. Today, 250 cans of sesame oil and 745 bags of soybeans are being shipped to Hong Kong. Yesterday, 1,475 bags of yellow soybeans were shipped from Tianjin.

### Finance; Western Merchants Are Again Buying Foreign Exchange

The foreign exchange market was unchanged yesterday. The HSBC list had no ups or downs. The black market for British and American exchange continued to soften. Although the China Bank was offering to Sasuun, foreign banks Sasuun and speculators unanimously purchased in the morning, and the position was insufficient. The US exchange rate once broke into the six-yuan mark, reporting 5.96875 yuan. The market trend initially showed loosening due to speculative resale, but later trading gradually decreased, and the closing price returned to flat. However, compared to the previous day, both British and American exchange rates tightened by 0.03125, with British gold at 3 pence 875 and US exchange at 6 yuan. The futures market was the same.

The U.S. Dollar Once Reached Six Yuan

In the early morning, the London large spread, both near and far, rose by 0.065. New York silver prices remained flat, London raw gold was stable, and the exchange rate between British and American dollars was unchanged, shrinking by 0.0625 against Shanghai, the American dollar fell by half a point against the British dollar, by a small five points against France, and there was no market. The central list of exchange rates remained the same. The bank's opening spot selling price in the morning was British gold at 3 pence 890625, and the US exchange rate was 6 yuan 03125. Compared to the closing price of the previous day, the British was tighter by 0.015625, and the American exchange rate was unchanged. After opening, the China Bank had sales, and foreign banks had a strong desire to purchase. The market was flat and slightly soft. It was calculated that Leveret entered China Bank's current order at 3 pence 875, and China Bank also sold to foreign banks the US exchange rate for the following month, which was also long, at 6 yuan 03125. The HSBC list announced no movement. The white silver balance tax was announced, increasing by 0.25 percent, totaling 24.5 percent. After this, although China Bank continued to sell, both Sassoon and the Japanese Bank Mitsui had needs. Chinese merchants also followed suit, and it was still tight.

### Golden Market Excitement; Is Only Temporary

Yesterday, the black market for current gold cash first rose to 5,600 yuan and then fell back to the 5,500 yuan line. In the morning session, due to the tightening of foreign exchange, people's hearts were excited, and the tendency to buy was dominant. Therefore, the market rose and rose, with silver houses and securities houses purchasing the most. Later, the foreign exchange calmed down, the buying trend dissipated, and securities houses and silver houses all scrambled to sell, and the price was quite sluggish. Although there were those who came out and then re-entered, the rising power was extremely weak. As a result, the closing price was 5,553 yuan, but it was still 38 yuan higher than the previous day. The total daily trading was still strong, at more than 2,000 taels. The price of silverware remained unchanged, and customs gold and other items were still flat.

Cash First Rose Then Fell

Initially, the market was very firm because of the slightly tight foreign exchange and more buyers on the counter. It was calculated that the silver house's doing business with 20 taels was 5,570 yuan, which was the opening price, which was already 35 yuan higher than the previous day. Subsequently, in the buying trend, it rose several dozen yuan again. It was calculated that the silver house entered the gold shop with 10 taels, which was 5,590 yuan. At this time, floating households made a slight settlement, slightly suppressed, it was calculated that the securities gang sold to the silver house 20 taels for 5,560 yuan, but the securities gang entered the gold shop 30 taels, and it rose to 5,580 yuan. However, because money changers and others released, it would fall to the lowest of 5,550 yuan, because the silver house and securities gang immediately bought up when it was cheap, and the lowest was pulled up to 5,600 yuan. It was heard that the foreign exchange was also tight, and it was calculated that the silver house securities gang was 10 taels, which was also 5,600 yuan. By the time of closing, the money changers and gold shops sold together, so they could not stand firm. The closing silver house issued 20 taels to the money changers, which was 5,663 yuan. The initial situation in the afternoon was stable, calculated by the gold and silver shops to make ten taels, which was 5,545 yuan, the silver house again made twenty taels, returning to 5,560 yuan, Naimo a few securities gangs and silver houses came to the market to sell, and finally pressed sharply, calculated by the securities gang out of the money exchange business ten taels, which was 5,525 yuan, Later, Lai Yinhao turned out to be an entry, and retail investors piled in, only to see the market high at 5,560 yuan. As a result, the Yinhao traded 10 taels for 5,553 yuan, as the closing price for the evening, which was 18 yuan higher than the day before, and a total of 85 yuan up and down throughout the day. The price of cash gold sold by the cash shop was more than ten yuan higher than that of gold, and the intake was thirty yuan lower. The current bid gold was fifty or sixty yuan lower than the listed gold, and there was little trading.

Gold Ornaments Finally Returned to Flat

The exchange price of silverware was hung by 10 yuan at 11 a.m., and the afternoon returned to 10 yuan, and the result did not move. The Datong shop hung up 570 yuan, and the new counterpart was similar to the above price, and the collection was about 30 yuan lower.

### American Dollar Tickets Well at 7 Points

Yesterday's foreign currency market situation, the market price of gold has finally slightly risen, so the British and American gold pounds unanimously rose slightly by 5 corners, and British gold tickets were still unattended. The market price was fixed as before, and the US gold ticket had been as high as 16 yuan 1 corner 8 minutes, but after the entry it slightly fell back, and the evening market retreated to 15 yuan 9 corner 8 points, which was still 7 points higher than the 10th. Hong Kong tickets fell slightly after the rise, and the final day was still down 2 points. The rising trend of Japanese gold tickets has been suppressed, and the evening market retreated to 1 yuan 5 corners 6 minutes, which was 3 minutes lower than the previous day. The need for Korean tickets has not decreased, and the market price continued to rise, and the evening market was as high as 1 yuan 2 corners 6 minutes.

### Discount Is About To Disappear

Yesterday's exchange clearance bill discount rate fell again, and each thousand yuan was initially discounted at 8 yuan, and then immediately fell to 7 yuan, and the entry was 6 yuan, and then down to 5 yuan in the afternoon, and the discount was 6 yuan, which was 2 yuan smaller than the previous day. The money industry association's split interest rate also fell sharply by 2 minutes, and both morning and afternoon markets were both.

### Bank Preparatory Committee; Lowers the Rate of Exchange Allotment; Sets the October Deposit Interest Rate at Three Yuan

The Shanghai Banking Industry United Preparatory Committee, from today (November 1st), revised the various interest rates as follows, counting (public list borrowing interest rate), national currency 2 jiao 5 fen, exchange allotment 1 jiao 5 fen, (acceptance bill 90-day discount rate) national currency Jiao 5 fen, exchange allotment 1 Jiao 5 points, (the same industry exchange appropriation interest), 1 corner 3 points, (except for interest on deposits), (the same industry exchange split lending owed interest), 1 corner 5 points, (all are calculated per thousand yuan per day).

"Note" The above reconciliation rate, compared with October 1st, the national currency interest rate has not changed, and the exchange allotment rate has been reduced by 3 points. The Association has also set the October interest rate for interbank transfer deposits at 3 yuan per thousand (that is, a monthly interest rate of 3%), which is half a yuan lower than in September.

### Securities; Domestic Debt Trading; From This Afternoon; All Changed to Use Allotment Heads

The black market for securities was more tired and weak yesterday, and it returned to a rotating situation, and trading became increasingly scarce. All gangs are very lazy to buy and sell, and the reason is that the ticket discounts of banknotes have gradually disappeared in recent days. The allotment of exchange has become increasingly scarce, and the public debt is based on exchange, but due to the shortage of funds, the transaction cannot be improved, which is also an important reason. Yesterday's trading Hongda had a slight purchase, Chengkang always sold, Lianhe advanced and then came out, and Yuxing still had a cage. The remaining buyers were Tongshen Hengfu Xie Xing Yuan and Yongkang, and the sellers were Gongmao and Hu Heji and No. 25, etc. The market was first rotating, and then slightly tired in the afternoon, and the result was slightly back to the small two corners to six corners, and the number of transactions was 700,000 to 800,000 yuan. The brief table is listed below.

After the closing yesterday, all securities colleagues were convened by Lianhe Hao for a meeting on the 7th floor, and more than 30 companies attended the meeting. At that time, it was resolved that the trading in the morning would still be settled by exchange, and from the afternoon onwards, all would be changed to allotment heads, and the entire certificate would be collected and resolved uniformly with allotment head bills, and all customer deposits would be mutually allocated to allotment heads with a 5-yuan discount rate. Because the banknote discount has been getting smaller and the exchange bills on the market have gradually disappeared, in order to promote business, all colleagues unanimously agree with this move.

In stock trading, 100 shares of Huashang Electric Power were traded at a price of 7 yuan. The stock market's actions seem more optimistic. Hutchison Whampoa has returned to a leading position, and it rose to 90 yuan at the beginning of the morning opening, and then continued to rise to 92 yuan, but most of the transaction price was 91 yuan, because the stock's soaring affected the stock prices of various trust companies, and all of them have made progress, and the remaining stocks have also been helped more or less. Rubber stocks, allowing the stocks of each Dutch company in the Dutch East Indies, have a strong trend, because the good interim interest is already in sight. The general public feels that yesterday's market purchases seem to be over-volume, so it is expected that there may be more long orders that are impatient today, making prices relatively cheaper.

London 30th (Wednesday) Telegraph, today the listing prices of Chinese foreign debt and Far East British companies' stocks are still flat and sluggish, and the market is generally not prosperous.

### Yarn Flowers; The Competition Between Bulls and Bears Is Fierce; Double Horse Hovers Around 1,200

The trend of the yarn market is erratic and impermanent. It rises and falls sharply. This is because speculative chips are flooded, and the competition between bulls and bears is fierce, resulting in inconsistent people's hearts, but actual transactions are becoming more and more stagnant. However, there is a part of the "1,200 yuan mark broke and rushed in" more people, while profit-takers made up for it, so both sides drove forward side by side, and the market turned from low to high. In short, looking at the overall situation, the current is still in the disk file in and out. Today, 635 pieces of existing yarn were shipped to Hong Kong.

The current yarn Chen opened because of the panic on the previous day, and people's hearts looked down. The opening price of 20 double horses was 1,200 yuan, a slight increase to 206 yuan. Xuan fell to 1,194 yuan due to short-selling activities, and once the mark was broken, the short-sellers thought of piling in again, and a certain long-term also came to add chips, and Chawen foreign exchange slightly shrank, and the buying trend turned up, and the market price gradually picked up, rising to 1,217 yuan, the long-term reappeared, and the actual sales stagnated, and it was slightly small to 1,207 yuan, and eventually felt dry on the table, and the buying trend suddenly came, It is actually the reason for the speculative heat. The market has risen step by step to 1,230 yuan, and after closing, it has returned to a small 23 yuan. It is estimated that the statistics of the transactions in each gang's mouth for half a day are 6,530 packages, and the market is up 19 yuan. The amount of each gang's mouth is listed on the left.

Peer 6.500 Hong Kong 40

Statistics 6.540

There is an inquiry about the market price of 7 cotton yarns. It is found that there is no transaction in the market recently, so this yarn is sold exclusively in the mainland and is prohibited from leaving the country, so there is no market. As for converting the price of 20 yarns, the current market is chaotic and there is no standard, and it is also difficult to estimate. It is estimated that it is 70 yuan to 100 yuan lower than 20 yarns, but according to the investigation of each factory, because of the cost relationship, they are unwilling to spin this yarn, because the profit of 20 yarns is thicker.

### Cotton Merchants Are Unwilling to Sell Cheaply; The Market Feels More Sluggish

The current situation of cotton is increasingly showing a wandering phenomenon, and the transaction is still extremely rare, and the factory is not very appetizing, and the colleagues are mostly watching. The delivery price of Pingguoer is 174 yuan, and the price of Huoji Hua is 221 yuan. Today, 315 pieces of cotton were shipped to Hong Kong.

Foreign cotton market prices, New York cotton market, firm and lively, after the prices of Wall Street stocks were firm, and some of the capital made up, the result closed up four or five pounds on the previous day, India rose more than one rupee yesterday, including forecasts.

The trading of foreign cotton in Shanghai Port has been particularly sluggish in recent days, and all parties are unusually quiet. Those who have raw cotton in stock are unwilling to sell at this time of fatigue, and the stock of raw cotton in the market is not abundant, and the price of raw cotton will not fall, and the minds of colleagues continue to be very high.

### Cloth; The Factory Market Rises and Falls Slightly; The Japanese Factory's Cloth Has a Continued Rising Trend

The trend of factory cloth is stable, Chen tired 搟 firm, up and down are extremely small, the holders are mostly on the sidelines, both in and out are rare, and the actual transaction lacks the amount of  the sale pan Fugui fine cloth 33 yuan, Fugui fine oblique 31 yuan 7 jiao half, lower than the previous day, fine cloth rose 2 jiao half, fine oblique stable, coarse cloth did not move, bleached cloth velvet because of the relationship between supply and demand, the rise and fall of each brand has differences, the street traded blank cloth velvet bleached cloth more than 300 pieces, Zhejiang Road Wen Yong help color inclined and other one hundred pieces, Min Chi help color cloth color inclined coarse cloth and other two white pieces, Beilu Yantai help coarse cloth velvet and other nearly one hundred pieces. Today, 1,240 pieces of cloth were shipped to Hong Kong.

The Longtou fine cloth, the closing price of the later market is 36 yuan 7 jiao half, and the price of the Four Gentlemen's drill is 1 yuan 1 corner 4 points 75, and there is a continued increase in momentum.

### Sales of Woolen Cloth to Traveling Merchants Decline Sharply, Decreasing by Ninety Percent

The woolen cloth market within the city remains prosperous. Retail shops, tailors, and overcoat makers are all experiencing brisk sales. Overcoat woolens, autumn flower woolens, haircloth, and single-sided flower woolens are selling particularly well. However, sales to traveling merchants are quite sluggish. Due to blocked transportation routes in the inland areas and frequent suspension of postal packages, and the strict controls imposed in the occupied areas, even with military expenses allocated to find ways to transport goods at risk, there are often dangers of loss or punishment. This has led to complaints from merchants in outer regions who, despite offering high prices, struggle to obtain goods. It has been observed recently that only merchants from Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Xiamen are still seeking to purchase woolen cloth, a decrease of ninety percent compared to the past. Those in the trade who specialized in catering to traveling merchants are now mostly suspending operations, changing their business focus to serving the local market.

### Sugar Market: Refined Sugar Sees Another Slight Increase

Yesterday, the sugar market saw a slight contraction in foreign exchange rates, improving sentiment. The Shanghai Sugar Merchant Association quoted spot prices for No. 24 coarse Japanese sugar at 72.50 yuan, up 0.50 yuan; foreign-branded sugar at 72 yuan, up 0.30 yuan; and transshipment goods at 57.50 yuan. Taikoo Granulated White B Mark from Western godowns was priced at 71 yuan; DY Mark from Western godowns at 66.70 yuan; from Eastern godowns at 66.40 to 66.60 yuan; HX Mark from X godowns at 66.40 yuan; and from Eastern godowns initially at 66.20 yuan, later rebounding to 66 yuan, all rising 0.40 yuan. Dutch Red spot goods were at 55 yuan, up 1 yuan.

### Dried North-South Goods: Bo Ping Black Dates Enter the Market; Peaches and Dates Also Arrive

### Seafood: Tapioca Flour Continues to Rise; Black Pepper Drops Slightly

The supply of tapioca flour has been dwindling recently, leading to a gradual decrease in stock levels, while demand remains strong, driving prices upward. Currently, Flying Unicorn and Human Gun labels are both selling at 72 yuan, while 3X and KG labels are at 71 yuan. Anchor, Peacock, and Double T are all priced at 60 yuan, and No. 3 flour is at 47 yuan, an increase of about 2 yuan compared to the previous market.

Black pepper has become sluggish and weak, with both Black Large and No. 1 Pepper priced at 105 yuan, down 4 yuan from before.

### Metals: Wire Rod Follows Steel Nails into Flatness and Weakness

Due to quiet trading conditions, the price of steel nails from local factories remains stagnant. Yesterday, the quoted price was still around 55 yuan. Demand from the construction sector in Covered Wood Street is slack, and sales to merchants in outer regions are also shallow. Although the Yunnan-Burma Road is open to merchants from Vietnam and Southeast Asia, the volume of goods transported is still limited, and the general atmosphere of stagnation is difficult to break. Daily sales volume is very small, which also affects the market for its raw materials (wire rod and wire). Besides being a raw material for steel nails, new wire rod is also used by wire mesh factories and screw factories, but the quantity is small compared to the large demand from nail factories, so the impact on market prices is still limited. Currently, the price is around 17 yuan per dan (unit of weight).

### U.S. New Consul General Issues Public Notice Yesterday: Urges Citizens to Leave in a Timely Manner; Advised to Take Advantage of Convenient Transportation to Pack Up and Return Home; No Guarantee that Ships Will Continue to Operate Smoothly Thereafter; Rumor that First Ship to Evacuate Nationals May Arrive in Shanghai Tomorrow

Regarding the Far East situation, on the surface, it appears to have eased in the past few days. However, the U.S. government, with foresight, believes that this temporary lull should not be regarded as evidence of a stabilized situation. Therefore, in addition to deploying thirty-one additional auxiliary ships to join the Asian fleet to strengthen its capabilities in preparation for emergencies, the United States is also continuing the evacuation of American citizens from the Far East. The newly appointed U.S. Consul General, Mr. Lockhart, in accordance with this policy, issued his first public notice to American citizens in Shanghai yesterday morning, urging them to take advantage of the available transportation facilities, emphasizing that such convenience cannot be guaranteed indefinitely. Mr. Lockhart's notice particularly emphasized this advice, which applies to women, children, and men who do not need to stay in Shanghai. Mr. Lockhart further stated that according to reports from the American President Lines, there are still many first and second class seats available on the Mondale, scheduled to depart Shanghai on the 3rd of this month.

Rumor: Mondale to Arrive in Shanghai Tomorrow

According to news from the shipping company, the first ship sent by the U.S. government to evacuate people from the Far East, the Mondale, arrived in Yokohama the day before yesterday and departed for Shanghai at 8:00 PM that evening. According to its planned route, it is expected to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow (2nd) morning to carry out its mission. However, it is said that the number of evacuees on board is not large, including the dependents of the U.S. Marine Corps leaving Shanghai, totaling about 300 people. According to the U.S. side, there are approximately 4,200 applications for evacuation. However, only a small number will leave Shanghai in the first batch. It is said that the Mondale still has 70 first-class cabins that have not been booked. This is not because American citizens are not enthusiastic about supporting the government, but because American citizens in Shanghai and other places have not had time to wind up their businesses and households in China. Those who are unable to afford the huge expenses are unable to bear it, while those who are wealthy have huge assets in Shanghai and are unwilling to leave immediately.

Other Two Ships: Cabins Are Full

In the first week of November, American citizens can still take two other President Lines ships: the President Pierce, which arrived in Shanghai from Little Luzon and Hong Kong at 2:45 PM yesterday, berthing at buoy No. 12/13 in the Huangpu River, and will leave for the United States this morning; and the President Coolidge, which is currently en route to Little Luzon via Hong Kong, will sail to Shanghai again on the 5th of this month, and then leave for the United States on the 6th. It is said that the cabins on both ships are fully booked.

Washington Ticket Price Inquiry

According to an announcement by the American President Lines, the first ship for evacuation, the President Malipoa, is expected to arrive in Shanghai on the 10th of this month, and after a few days, it will pass through Qinhuangdao, Kobe, Honolulu, and arrive in San Francisco. The third ship, the Washington, will arrive in Shanghai on the 7th and depart from Shanghai via Manila and Los Angeles on the 21st, scheduled to arrive in California on December 8th. The ticket prices for the first-class cabins on this ship are the same as those of regular mail ships. There are 298 berths and 47 smaller berths in tourist-class cabins. The ticket price for berths is US$240 to US$260, and the ticket price for smaller berths is US$190 to US$210. The European third-class cabins include 149 berths and 19 smaller berths, with ticket prices of US$150 for berths and US$100 for smaller berths. The cabins on regular mail ships, namely the Pierce and Coolidge, are fully booked, but there are many vacancies on the evacuation ships.

Appealing to the Government: Subsidize Travel Expenses

American citizens in Shanghai are deeply dissatisfied with the reply from Washington refusing to subsidize the travel expenses for the evacuation of American citizens from the Far East, because the most economical ticket price for evacuation ships is US$250 to US$300, which is equivalent to 4,000 to 5,000 Chinese yuan per person. The income of most American citizens in Shanghai is in legal tender, making it difficult to raise this large sum of money. It is even more difficult for a head of household to bear the travel expenses for several people. Yesterday, Mr. Elcott expressed his dissatisfaction on behalf of American citizens during a radio broadcast, saying that the U.S. government's advice to evacuate citizens focuses on women and children who do not need to stay, but women and children have no money on hand and should be given relief. The American Citizens Association and the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai sympathize with this view and are currently discussing further steps. They will jointly send a telegram to Washington on the 1st or 2nd to request the State Department to reconsider its decision and provide appropriate assistance to American citizens who are unable to evacuate.

Advising Officers: Move into the Defense Zone

An officer of the U.S. Navy's 4th Marine Regiment stated yesterday that regarding the notice issued by the headquarters of the 4th Marine Regiment, instructing officers residing in the French Concession and other areas of the International Settlement to move into the designated area so that they can be summoned at any time in an emergency, the officers have not taken any action for the time being. Most officers have obtained the consent of the competent authorities and plan to move after the ships carrying American evacuees have sailed.

### American Deputy Consul General Returns Home Today - Highly Reputable Deputy Consul General in Shanghai - Returns to the US for Rest and New Position

The English-language "North China Daily News" reports that Mr. Buttrick, who has served at the American Consulate General in Shanghai for six years, will leave Shanghai for Washington tomorrow (the 1st) on the President Pierce. Mr. Buttrick told reporters this morning (the 31st) that he currently does not have a confirmed position and therefore does not wish the newspapers to publish a major announcement about his departure. According to reports, Mr. Buttrick enjoys a high reputation among the American community and all sectors of Shanghai. In May, the former American Consul General in Shanghai, Mr. Gauss, was transferred to become the first American Minister to Australia, and Mr. Buttrick took over as Deputy Consul General. He remained in that role until the new Consul General, Mr. Lockhart, arrived in Shanghai last week and took over. After the outbreak of the Shanghai war, Mr. Buttrick also served as the "unofficial" spokesperson for the American Consulate, maintaining close contact with newspaper reporters. As for whether Mr. Buttrick will be transferred to another position after his trip to Washington, no announcement has been made yet. However, it is rumored that Mr. Buttrick will take a short vacation in the United States and then take on a new position.

### Yesterday's Commemoration of the Lone Army's Retreat into the Concession Three Weeks Ago - General Chiang's Admonition of "Sharpening Their Will" Encourages Comrades - The Spirit of the Entire Battalion is Inspired and the Ceremony is More Solemn and Intense

Yesterday marked the third-week anniversary of the Lone Army's retreat from the Sihang Warehouse into the concession under orders. Commander Xie of the Lone Army in Jiaozhou Road held a reception for the Shanghai press yesterday afternoon at the barracks after holding a sports meet, in commemoration. Approximately 200 guests from all walks of life attended, and the atmosphere was enthusiastic. The detailed information obtained is recorded below:

Commemoration of the Retreat Three Weeks Ago

In the 26th year of the Republic of China, when the Sino-Japanese War extended to Shanghai, as the Chinese army shifted westward due to strategic reasons, the Chinese army stationed at the Sihang Warehouse north of the Suzhou River, led by Commander Xie Jinyuan, made a final stand. After that, they accepted the invitation of the concession authorities and withdrew the entire battalion into the concession, residing in the current barracks on Jiaozhou Road. Commander Xie organized a commemorative ceremony yesterday afternoon at 5 p.m. in the camp's open space to commemorate this heroic and solemn day, and also invited the Shanghai press to join in the celebration.

The Entire Lone Army is Inspired

Yesterday morning, more than 200 youths and students were invited. The Lone Army barracks specially assigned ushers to maintain order and receive the guests. At 11 a.m., the closing ceremony of the Lone Army sports meet was held. Commander Xie and guests gave speeches to encourage each other. At noon, the New Art Troupe, organized by outside youths, performed. The Lone Army drama troupe also performed the play "Until Tomorrow," which was very successful. The entire Lone Army was inspired yesterday. They all held optimistic views about the future and expressed their intention to continue working hard. Commander Xie frequently shook hands with visiting guests, and was extremely busy. Yesterday, the White Russian Merchant Corps re-imposed martial law around the barracks. Corps members patrolled with guns from time to time. Guests entering and leaving had to leave their names, and restrictions were somewhat strict.

Admonishing Officers to Sharpen Their Will

Yesterday evening, in addition to more than 20 reporters from various newspapers, Wu Xuecheng, Guan Youwen, members of the Lone Army Sports Meet Preparatory Committee, and Wang Huaiqi, Wang Xiang, Zhang Jiazhen, Yang Yongcan, and more than 30 other sports representatives from various schools attended this great commemorative festival. At half past four, the ceremony began. After the rituals were performed, Commander Xie gave a speech to all officers and soldiers, and used General Chiang's recently issued admonition of "Sharpening Their Will" to inspire them. At five o'clock, a dinner was held, with dishes made by the officers and soldiers of the battalion themselves, which were substantial and palatable. After the hosts and guests wished each other success, they dispersed at six o'clock.

### Solicitation of Winter Clothing Donations Extended for One Month

Since the Chongqing Winter Clothing Donation Movement General Association promoted the nationwide micro-donation of winter clothing, people from all over the country and abroad have been enthusiastically donating. Under the central leadership, the Shanghai winter clothing donation was promoted by the Micro-Donation慰勞 代金 Committee, following the precedent of soliciting funds for military support during the Spring Festival, and assessed quotas to various trade associations and school organizations. Although the people of Shanghai are in a special environment, they continue the spirit of the past in donating money for winter clothing, and have actively contributed. However, the original deadline was yesterday, but because the procedures for collecting and submitting donations by various trade associations, schools, newspaper offices, and organizations were complex, they could not be completed in time, and the total amount of one million yuan was not reached. The Donation Committee, in view of the enthusiasm of all sectors and the desire for an extension, so that organizations that have not yet participated can have the opportunity to fully serve, the Donation Committee, in addition to sending a special telegram to the Chongqing Winter Clothing Donation General Association the day before yesterday to report on the solicitation situation and request a delay, has specifically decided to continue the extension for one month from today, until the end of November, when the entire process will be completed and will not be delayed any further.

### Soviet Residents in Shanghai Celebrate the Anniversary of the Revolution - Dance Parties to be Held for Five Days Starting from the 7th - Latvians, Estonians, and Lithuanians also Invited to Attend

The "Continental News" reports that Soviet residents in Shanghai have decided to hold a dance party at the American Women's Club for five days starting from November 7th to celebrate the 23rd anniversary of the Soviet Revolution. This grand event, initiated by the Shanghai Soviet僑 總會, will invite Latvian, Estonian, and Lithuanian residents to attend. Currently, the Soviet Embassy is in Japan, so the Shanghai diplomatic community will not be formally invited. The dance party will begin at 9 p.m. on November 7th. On the 8th, a Soviet film titled "High Reward" will be screened at the American Women's Club. After the screening, the Soviet僑 organized orchestra will perform and start dancing. On the 9th, the Soviet film "Lenin in 1918" will be screened, followed by dancing. Other films will also be screened and dances held on the following two days, and the Soviet僑 organized symphony chorus will sing, enjoying themselves for five days before the celebration ends. The Soviet僑總會 has also invited White Russians from Shanghai to attend, but the White Russians will go to the White Russian Church on November 7th to pray, expressing their condolences.

### Price Increase on Passenger Tickets for Jardine Matheson and Butterfield & Swire - Uniform Increase on North and South Pacific Routes - Ranging from 10% to 25%

Chinese coastal and Yangtze River shipping has always been dominated by the British-owned Jardine Matheson and Butterfield & Swire shipping companies. Since the war on the Yangtze River shifted westward, foreign ships have suspended operations and Japanese ships have dominated. As for coastal North and South Pacific shipping, the Japanese army controls various supplies in the northern ports, so business is slightly inferior. Although Shantou and Guangzhou have fallen in the South Pacific, Hong Kong is British territory, and goods are transported south to Hong Kong as a central point. British ships still maintain the leading position in transportation. Passengers, regardless of whether they are traveling to North or South Pacific ports, still recognize British ships as reliable, and ticket prices have been increased repeatedly. It is now learned that Jardine Matheson and Butterfield & Swire have recently agreed on new prices, increasing the previous prices by 10% to 25%. The new prices are recorded below:

North Pacific Route

From Shanghai to Qingdao: First Class (Large Dining Room) 50 yuan, Second Class (Official Cabin) 40 yuan, Third Class (Cabin) 30 yuan, Fourth Class (Steerage) 18 yuan. To Weihaiwei: First Class 60 yuan, Second Class 44 yuan, Third Class 35 yuan, Fourth Class 24 yuan. To Yantai: First Class 64 yuan, Second Class 52 yuan, Third Class 37 yuan, Fourth Class 26 yuan. To Tianjin: First Class 80 yuan, Second Class 60 yuan, Third Class 48 yuan, Fourth Class 35 yuan.

South Pacific Route

From Shanghai to Wenzhou: First Class 50 yuan, Second Class 40 yuan, Third Class 30 yuan, Fourth Class 18 yuan. To Fuzhou: First Class 60 yuan, Second Class 45 yuan, Third Class 35 yuan, Fourth Class 25 yuan. To Xiamen: First Class 75 yuan, Second Class 50 yuan, Third Class 40 yuan, Fourth Class 30 yuan. To Shantou: First Class 80 yuan, Second Class 60 yuan, Third Class 45 yuan, Fourth Class 30 yuan. To Hong Kong: First Class 100 yuan, Second Class 80 yuan, Third Class 60 yuan, Fourth Class 40 yuan. To Guangzhou: First Class 110 yuan, Second Class 90 yuan, Third Class 65 yuan, Fourth Class 45 yuan. However, after the fall of Guangzhou, British ships suspended operations. Although the Japanese side nominally opened the Pearl River, the customs and handling of goods for export are too harsh, so British ships still do not go to Guangzhou.

Shanghai Defense Line

"Both Wan Estuary and Beihai": From Shanghai to Haikou: First Class 130 yuan, Second Class 100 yuan, Third Class 70 yuan, Fourth Class 50 yuan. To Beihai: First Class 150 yuan, Second Class 120 yuan, Third Class 80 yuan, Fourth Class 60 yuan. To Haiphong: First Class 200 yuan, Second Class 150 yuan, Third Class 100 yuan, Fourth Class 75 yuan. Head tax also applies: First Class 8 yuan, Second Class 4 yuan, Third and Fourth Class 2 yuan. British ships on the Shanghai defense line have also temporarily suspended operations.

### Matured Government Bond Principal and Interest Payments Begin Yesterday - Unified Ding Bonds to be Drawn on the 9th

### Stalled Goods and Passengers Returning from Vietnam are Obstructed - Shanghai Merchants Anxious

The return of goods and passengers from Saigon and Haiphong that are stalled in Vietnam to Hong Kong and Shanghai had already been approved by the Vietnamese government, but the first batch of goods loaded on the ship was blocked by the Japanese. The details were recorded in yesterday's newspaper. It is now learned that Cao Anxuan, the special commissioner sent by Shanghai to negotiate with Vietnam, has returned to Hong Kong and will return to Shanghai to report the details. It has been found that the Vietnamese Governor canceled the approval order, which was announced last Saturday. All industries in Shanghai have telegraphed the Vietnamese authorities yesterday, requesting them to withdraw the order and allow the goods to return, and have also telegraphed the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce for assistance.

### Admiral Hart's Yacht to Cruise Westward Next Week - Passing Through Zhenjiang and Nanjing, Ending at Wuhu

After Admiral Hart's private yacht, the Isabel, of the US Asiatic Fleet, arrived in Shanghai on the 6th of this month with Admiral Hart from North China, it has been anchored on the Bund outside the French Concession for a long time. In late this month, after Hart himself went to Manila on the Augustus, the Isabel did not accompany him due to Shanghai's defense relationship. According to reporters from the Xinsheng News Agency, the Isabel is scheduled to go upstream from Shanghai next week, passing through Zhenjiang and Nanjing, and ending at Wuhu, for a routine winter cruise. The US Navy officials are unwilling to disclose when it will return to Shanghai.

### House and Municipal Tax - Equipment Fees Should be Excluded - The Bureau Revises the Percentage Table and Collects Taxes According to the Table - Effective from October for a Period of One Year

The Public Concession 工部局 has issued a notice to revise the method of calculating the municipal tax payable by excluding the equipment fees included in the total rent. The notice states that if the total rent paid for leased houses includes the cost of equipment provided by the landlord, this fee may be deducted separately when calculating the municipal tax payable, according to the revised percentage table below, under the following conditions: (1) Regardless of the amount of rent paid or the type of equipment provided by the landlord, the Bureau reserves the right to assess the rental value itself. (2) The percentage of deduction currently approved by the Bureau is the maximum limit. Its effective period is from October 1, 1940 to September 30, 1941. (3) Only newly increased total rent is allowed to be calculated by deducting according to the revised percentage table, and the amount deducted is limited to not reducing the actual rental value on which the tax is levied. The percentage table for deducting calculation is as follows:

Hereby announce to all, this notice.

### America Decides Not to Abandon Shanghai - Evacuation of Overseas Chinese is a Liquidation with Japan

The "Millard's Review" published this week has a comment by foreign economic commentator Ahlex on the fact that the United States cannot abandon Shanghai. Currently, the overseas Chinese who are about to withdraw from Shanghai are only women and children. Men may never leave Shanghai, and the women and children who have withdrawn may return to Shanghai in the near future and find that their men in Shanghai are safe and sound and operating as usual. Perhaps an emergency will occur, and American businessmen will also have to withdraw, but even under this circumstance, one cannot have the illusion that overseas Chinese will withdraw forever. Even if they have to leave Shanghai, when the United States settles accounts with Japan, American commerce in Shanghai will inevitably be forced to a short-term standstill, but there will soon be a recovery period. The United States was unable to obtain the cooperation of the United Kingdom in opposing Japan in 1931-32, and had to acquiesce to Japan's forced implementation of the "New Order" in Manchuria, and the same is true in North China.

The Center of Far East Commerce is in Shanghai

But if Japan believes that it can safely force its "New Order" on American commerce in Shanghai, it will make a huge mistake. The United States believes that Shanghai is the center of Far East commerce and is extremely important to American commerce. Under no circumstances will it willingly be sacrificed to the "New Order" policy. Since this year, the commerce between the United States and various countries in the Far East is very different from the past. The trend of Southeast Asia and China is increasing day by day, while Japan has maintained a fixed state at the beginning of this year, and has been decreasing day by day in recent months. The trend of American Far East trade is closely related to its Far East policy. All the countries where American trade has a special increase are outside Japan's sphere of influence. Even if there is a country with a decreasing trend, it is in a zone where Japan is forcing the implementation of a new economic order. The US State Department has issued several warnings to the American business community, saying that the huge amount of commerce between the United States and Japan a few years ago was a temporary phenomenon and will eventually decline. This is exactly in line with the current facts.

American Commerce in North China is Excluded

Before the Sino-Japanese War, the United States traded with Japan about three to four times as much as it traded with China. In the first two years after the start of the war, Japan's trade with the United States was almost five or six times as much as China's trade with the United States. But this year, Japan's trade with the United States is almost less than twice as much as China's trade with the United States. American trade in North China has almost been excluded by Japan. Only in Shanghai can American goods still be imported into China without Japanese interference, and Chinese goods cannot be exported to the United States without being obstructed by Japan. As a result, in the past three quarters of this year, Shanghai alone accounted for 70% of American imports to China and 80% of Chinese exports to the United States. Under these circumstances, there is no doubt that the United States is unwilling to see Shanghai commerce destroyed by Japan's "New Order."

The Facts are the Opposite of What Japan Propagates

If Japan completely controls Shanghai, Japan will use the same means in Shanghai as it did in North China, and American commerce will become the remnant of Japanese commerce. American commerce in China will also disappear with Shanghai. In the past ten years, Japan has tried its best to persuade the United States not to oppose Japan's expansion of territory, saying that this can develop economic resources and benefit the United States. However, the facts are enough to overturn Japan's propaganda. In addition to not being able to obtain additional commercial benefits from Japan's expansion, American commercial activities are also prohibited wherever the Japanese flag flies. Facts have proven that Japan's continental expansion policy is the mortal enemy of American Far East commercial activities. American Far East commerce can only prosper where Japan's iron fist cannot reach.

### Number of French Ships on Shanghai-Vietnam Route Increased to Five - Bulk of Imports is Foreign Rice - Exports Mostly Steel

After French ships resumed sailing on the Shanghai-Vietnam route, the number of ships operating has been increased repeatedly. First, the Ros, Los, and Kindia came to Shanghai and have decided to resume sailing from Shanghai to Haiphong and Saigon. The details have been recorded in previous newspapers. It is now learned that the Guangdong and the Songtai, which arrived in Shanghai yesterday, have followed. There are now five ships operating on the Shanghai defense line. The bulk of imports is foreign rice and pearl rice. The Songtai is carrying a huge amount of 66,000 bags of foreign rice. The exports are mostly steel. The Songtai is scheduled to load cargo on the 4th and export it to Gongfang on the 5th. All five ships are cargo ships and do not have passenger berths. There is also the Datnam mail ship operating on the new route, which has first, second, third, and fourth class passenger berths and is luxuriously equipped. It is scheduled to go to Japan next Monday, return to Shanghai on the 13th, and go to Little Luzon from Shanghai on the 14th and return to Saigon. The Xijiang was also originally participating in the Shanghai-Vietnam route, but was detained by the Japanese navy for carrying military supplies to Yangon, and there has been no news of its release so far.

### Telephone Rate Increase Issue - Not Yet Discussed - Because the French Municipal Council Has Not Replied - Most Chinese Oppose It

The issue of telephone rate increases has already aroused the concern of tens of thousands of telephone users in this port. After the telephone company submitted a request to the Public Concession 工部局 to increase rates, the 工部局 originally scheduled to submit it for discussion at the board meeting this Wednesday. However, because the French Municipal Council's reply on the rate increase opinion has not yet been received, it has not been submitted for discussion. It must be considered after the French Municipal Council replies. However, according to the opinions of some Chinese, they all believe that the reason for the telephone company's rate increase this time is to add 16,000 new telephone sets for new users who have recently registered with the company. The company has requested the 工部局 to require a rate increase because the purchase of parts and materials is currently expensive. However, Shanghai's current prosperity is abnormal. Whether these 16,000 new users are needed is questionable. Moreover, since telephone calls have been calculated by decision, users can no longer afford it. Therefore, all sectors of the Chinese community hope that the 工部局 will carefully review this issue.

### Shaoxing Long-Distance Telephone - One Section Repaired - Japanese艇 Spy on Zhenhai - Attempt to Land is Repelled

After the East Zhejiang Chinese army recovered Keqiao, Shaoxing, and nearby important strongholds, the Japanese army retreated to Xiaoshan. The Chinese army is now pursuing them in two routes, one from Xia Li, advancing westward, and one from Lizhu, pursuing to 惦. After being repaired by a craftsman, the Shaoxing long-distance telephone has been connected to Dongguan. The rest will be repaired within a few days. However, after the city was robbed, disaster-stricken refugees lined the streets. Local officials and gentry are separately appeasing the displaced and stabilizing order. The telegrams between Shanghai and Shaoxing will be restored today and tomorrow. The Shanghai-Shaoxing exchange has also been restored.

The Zhejiang organizations in Shanghai received the following telegram from East Zhejiang yesterday: (1) A Japanese艦 outside Zhenhai Port, on the morning of the 30th at 4:20 a.m., put down two small motorboats, which were patrolling back and forth on the sea and sweeping machine guns towards the Jiangnan area. The garrison troops responded fiercely, and the Japanese boats fled back to their original ships.

### Evaluation Committee Asks Both Authorities to Encourage Citizens to Order Rice in Groups - Preparedness is Better Than Unpreparedness to Prevent操縱 at Any Time - Flat Rice Sales Continue This Afternoon

In order to continue benefiting the common people, the Shanghai 平糶 Committee has decided to handle the seventh phase of flat rice sales. It is now scheduled to start at the same time at 60 平糶 places in the two concessions from 2 p.m. today. Anyone who purchases flat rice can buy rice tickets nearby and then receive rice at the rice distribution point. Each person is limited to purchasing 4 市斤 of rice for 1 national currency per day. At that time, the police authorities of the two concessions will send detectives to maintain order at each 平糶 place, and all civilians purchasing rice must follow the established regulations. The 工部局 has also made a public announcement.

Rice Evaluation

The committee sent a letter to the authorities of the two concessions yesterday, saying, "We have checked that our committee has repeatedly received instructions from your bureau to resume the evaluation of foreign rice, and that the evaluation standards are to be based on the cost plus reasonable profits. We convened a meeting on the 29th of this month to discuss this matter. We all believe that the current market price in Shanghai is already lower than the price in the production area. If we follow your bureau's instructions and add profits and losses, the price will exceed the market price by a large margin. If we announce the evaluation at this time, it may easily cause suspicion among those outside who do not know the truth. According to the initial month, the highest fixed price of No. 2 Saigon was 79 yuan and 6 corners, and then gradually decreased. By the 15th of this month, it was 75 yuan and 8 corners, and on the 17th it was 73 yuan and 6 corners, all of which have been detailed in previous letters. Now, based on the production price on the day of the decision meeting (29th), it is 71 yuan, plus a temporary military insurance of 2 yuan and 5 corners (this military insurance will be continued in the future, depending on the situation), and a loss and other expenses of 3 yuan, for a total cost of 76 yuan and 5 corners per bag, which is equivalent to 61 yuan per stone. The market price in Shanghai on that day was exactly 61 yuan.

Barely Covering Costs

There are no reasonable profits included. As for the goods ordered previously, some have not yet been fully loaded on the ship, and the losses are already considerable, exceeding 10% and more. Under these circumstances, rice merchants inevitably feel deeply troubled by the issue of renewing orders. Even if the production price on the 29th was the lowest in a month, no one ordered it because the rice merchants were unable to do so. It seems that whether the subsequent sources can be continuous and whether the market price can remain stable for a long time is a big question. Therefore, the key today seems not to be in the urgent determination of the selling price, but in the method of thickening the reserves. In addition to persuading the industry to renew orders by various rice industry groups, we plan to ask your bureau to encourage citizens to actively participate in the group purchases of the Civil Food Regulation Association, or to prepare more purchases while the market price is relatively low. In this way, with thicker reserves, the rice market will be stable. The above is the result of the discussion at this meeting. We are submitting this letter for your inspection and instructions. We are infinitely grateful. Also, from the 25th of last month to yesterday,

Gongmi has been shipped

to more than 130,000 bags. The French mail ship "Dadao" arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon and berthed at the Shuntai Wharf, carrying more than 40,000 bags of Gongmi. As for the French mail ship "Bangkok," it is also on its way to Shanghai and is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai before the 5th of this month. The ship also contains about 40,000 bags of foreign rice. According to the Shanghai Rice Evaluation Committee, as of yesterday, the amount of rice in storage has increased significantly.

### The Owner of Huizhong Hostel, Sun Zhizhai, Was Kidnapped Yesterday

### Three Kidnappers Lay in Ambush Inside the Hostel, and Sun Was Abducted Without a Trace When He Came Down to the Office

A kidnapping occurred yesterday morning inside the New Huizhong Hostel at the intersection of Hankou Road and Daxin Street. The victim was Sun Zhizhai, also known as Bo Sheng, a native of Changshu and the owner of the hostel. He was sixty-two years old and wealthy. Before the war, he resided in his hometown, but he often traveled between Changshu and Shanghai. After the "August 13th" incident, his hometown fell, and he brought his family to Shanghai, residing on the fifth floor of the New Huizhong Hostel. Unexpectedly, he was targeted by bandits. Three bandits abducted Sun from the hostel's corridor, forced him into a black car that was waiting in front of the hostel, and sped away. The details are as follows:

Descending to the Office, Forcibly Put into a Car

At around 8:45 yesterday morning, Sun went down to the accounting room to work after breakfast, as usual. He took the elevator downstairs and had only taken a few steps out of the elevator door when three kidnappers suddenly appeared. Two of them were holding pistols and had been lying in wait by the corridor. Upon seeing Sun, they pointed their guns at him without asking questions to intimidate him. Two bandits held him on either side, slowly led him out, and forced him into a black car with license plate number 5624, which was waiting in front of the hostel. The car sped west, turning onto Fuzhou Road. A clerk in the accounting room witnessed the scene and immediately reported it to the Old Zha Police Station. At that time, nearby patrol officers had also heard the news and reported it. A Western police officer jumped into another car and chased after them, but by the time they reached the Waibaidu Bridge on the Bund, the bandits' car was already gone without a trace, so they turned back.

Car Found, Victim Missing

It was later learned that two customers had suddenly come to the New Asia & Co. car rental agency at 422 Tiantong Road in Hongkou an hour earlier, ordering a driver to take the car to the Paramount Ballroom entrance on YuYuan Road, where another bandit was waiting to board. Then, they ordered the driver to go to Kaina Road, where the bandits threatened the driver with a gun and then forced him out of the car, taking over the driving duties themselves. An hour later, that same car was used to kidnap Sun Zhizhai. The car driver reported to the Jing'an Temple Police Station, and at 12:10 noon, the car was discovered near the Zhaofeng Garden in West Shanghai. Sun's whereabouts remained unknown until evening. The Old Zha Police Station is currently investigating.

### Shooting Incident on Wuchang Road, Hongkou

### Huang Dabao Murdered in Revenge

The situation in Hongkou yesterday morning was tense for a while. At the time, the Japanese army increased patrols along Suzhou Creek, ZhaPu Road Bridge, and Sichuan Road Bridge, searching pedestrians for an hour. According to a Pingming News Agency reporter, a shooting occurred at the intersection of Wuchang Road and ZhaPu Road. The Japanese army, upon hearing the news, thought a major incident had occurred and dispatched a large number of Japanese soldiers to the scene and along the river bridges to maintain order. After investigation, it was found to be a revenge killing. Yesterday morning at nine o'clock, Huang Dabao, a 34-year-old Hubei native, was walking along the intersection of Wuchang Road and ZhaPu Road when he was suddenly shot four or five times. Three bullets hit his back and left leg, and he fell to the ground on the spot. He was taken to the Bazilu Sanatorium. The murderer escaped without a trace. When the Japanese army maintained order after the incident, local residents were greatly alarmed.

### Two Major Robbers Sentenced Heavily

Major robbers Cao, from Xuzhou, and Zhang Fa, from Yangzhou, were convicted of robbing the Securities Building, De Fu Bank, of gold bars and legal tender totaling more than 257,000 yuan, as well as robbing public pistols from Chinese constables at No. 1553, No. 1593, and Chinese detective Xia Shutang at No. 138. They were also convicted of kidnapping Feng Jiaxiang and Li Zitang, senior staff of the Nanyang Tobacco Company, and many other robberies. They were arrested by detectives from the Old Zha Police Station and brought to trial in the Criminal Division of the First Special Court. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Xie fen announced the verdicts: Cao was sentenced to twelve years in prison, and Zhang Fa was sentenced to eight years in prison as a warning.

### Korean Morphine Dealer Stabs Rogue to Death

### The Murderer Fled After the Incident

Li Jinyuan, a 25-year-old rogue from Yangzhou residing at 183 Lakenna Road (now Huanghe Road) in the French Concession, and his accomplice Yang Honggen from Suzhou went to the entrance of Dunheli Lane at 95 Julaida Road at three o'clock yesterday afternoon to extort protection money from a Korean man selling morphine there. They failed, leading to a conflict, which escalated into violence. Both Li and Yang were stabbed with a bayonet. Yang Honggen was lightly injured and fled with his wound, while Li Jinyuan was stabbed in the middle of his left arm and thigh. Due to a ruptured blood vessel, he bled profusely and collapsed on the spot, dying before he could be treated. The Korean man, seeing that he had caused a fatal disaster, fled without a trace. Passersby reported to the French Police Station, which dispatched detectives to investigate. The body was taken to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Funeral Home for an autopsy. Li Shuangyuan, the victim's older brother, also arrived at the scene after hearing the news to inquire about the incident, and he will report to the Second Special Court today to send personnel to examine the body.

### Foreign Robbery Gang Arrested for Robbing a Restaurant

### Injured Korean Bandit Arrested While Seeking Treatment

### Another Accomplice Arrested Based on His Confession

On the afternoon of the 28th of this month, a man with a gunshot wound to the head suddenly sought treatment at the Sanmin Hospital at 70 North Henan Road. The hospital reported to the police station, which ordered detectives to investigate. It was learned that the man, named Daguji, was a Korean, and he was transferred to the Hongkou Fumin Hospital. The New Zha Police Station, led by Western Detective Chief Shalei and Chinese Detective Ruan Yao, conducted a detailed investigation and learned that Daguji was actually an armed robber, possessing two pistols. He had met at the Yanziwo (Swallow's Nest) on the second floor of the Central Hotel on Guangdong Road with

A Mixed-Race Man

Luo Zhen (29 years old, father was British, mother was Chinese, not recognized as British, previously a proofreader at a newspaper office at 130 Edward Road). Both were in financial straits and, in September this year, carrying weapons, they had the idea to rob a restaurant at the intersection of Wuma Road and Henan Road. They robbed 250 yuan in cash. Afterwards, they formed a gang and robbed several restaurants on YuQiaQing Road and Guangxi Road, sharing the loot. On the evening of the 27th of this month at 9:00 PM, Daguji and Luo Zhen each carrying a pistol, went to the Wuweizhai Restaurant at 76 Jing'an Temple Road, robbing 500 yuan in legal tender and fleeing. The accountant Bao Jixiang

Followed and Chased Them Out

He saw them emerge from Lane 70, hailed a rickshaw, and went to Guling Road, then reported to Chinese constable No. 2768, who stepped forward to arrest them, ordering them to stop. They did not listen. At that time, Luo escaped, but Daguji fled into the doorway of No. 67 in a certain lane, and the constable shot him down. He then turned around to arrest the other robber but failed. Unexpectedly, when the constable returned to the lane, the wounded bandit had escaped, leaving only a pool of blood on the ground. It was discovered that after being wounded, Daguji still hired a rickshaw and went to various

Hospitals Seeking Treatment

But all refused him. Finally, he was arrested at the Sanmin Hospital and confessed that Luo Zhen was hiding at No. 2, Lane 154, North Henan Road. Luo was arrested there at 2:30 PM the day before yesterday, and a pistol and six bullets were confiscated. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police attorney Li Zhishan stated the above situation and requested detention. When questioned, Luo Zhen confessed in English that he and Daguji had committed the robberies. Judge Liu ruled that Luo would be detained pending further interrogation in fourteen days.

Ding appealed the ruling, appointing lawyers Jin Yu and Peng Qixiu to appeal to the Third Branch of the High Court. Yesterday morning, the appeal was concluded with the ruling: "Ruling" The original judgment is revoked, and Ding Wan'e is not guilty.

Chronicles

Roadside Reverie

### Rows of Cars

— Gao Yang

The Di Feng Road running north-south intersects with the Yu Yuan Road running east-west, lying in wait. On the road running east-west, there's a barbed wire fence, and in front of it stands a yellow-uniformed man with an exotic flair, his hand resting imposingly on the hilt of his command saber.

Private cars passing through have to rely on "luck." If he's in a good mood, he'll give it a quick check; otherwise, he'll just flick his thumb back and wave, and you can breathe a sigh of relief, escaping the "checkpoint," your anxious heart finally able to calm down.

On the south side, buses and trams can't escape the net. They must be checked one by one, and passengers must disembark and register. Because registering passengers on each vehicle takes time, trams and buses are "stockpiled" — not in the sense of becoming a "rare commodity," but instead experiencing a decline in business to the point of being "desolate enough to catch sparrows."

As one car after another comes up, the one registering in front doesn't move, and those behind aren't allowed to advance, so they have to stop on the east end of the north-south road, unable to cross the street. Consequently, the long line of cars can extend to fifteen or sixteen vehicles. Trams interspersed with buses can sometimes be seen when taking a turn from Jessfield Road. It's said that double-decker buses were even worse and slower to register at first, but now that they've switched to "single-decker buses," things have improved a lot.

On the north side, rows of people can pass without being checked or registered. So people pass by on the north-side sidewalk. Passengers who disembarked from the "double-decker bus" on Jing'an Temple Road wouldn't even bother to switch to a "single-decker bus," preferring to walk across Di Feng Road to get on the bus, avoiding a lot of trouble. As a result, the bus stop near the "Foreign School" is crowded.

However, the cars coming out from inside are packed with people, but since they're going to the concession, they don't care.

A Row of People Registering

On the sidewalk south of Yu Yuan Road, there's a small table where someone is managing the registration process, with guards standing nearby.

"What's your surname? What's your name? Where do you live? What do you do for a living? Why are you here?" A series of identical questions, as if coming from a model, and the pencil mechanically scribbles across the paper.

One by one, they line up, write, and then leave. The car engine sounds, and another one follows.

There are quite a few cars stopped behind, and the ticket sellers and drivers are really annoyed, so they run out to chat by the side of the vehicles.

"Hey, Jin Fu, bring those two 'shells' over here!" a driver shouts, not far from the barbed wire fence.

Several modern girls, holding thick foreign books in their hands, walk past the "lockdown line" with smiles on their faces, rushing to catch the bus.

"Bye-Bye! Lili!" a girl shouts, waving a hand as she runs over.

The car behind that's "finished" registering comes up!

Two Flags

Past the middle section of the "blockade line," things "seem normal," "peaceful as usual." However, No. 668 Lane is a bit different.

Since it's said to be the "site of the incident," it's unavoidable.

Every household hangs two flags, which may look nice, but they flutter weakly in the wind, seeming extraordinarily powerless.

Some people inside are preparing to move, and the roofs and walls of the white factory buildings are being demolished to make way for a road. Today is the first day they agreed to move, but the surveillance is still very strict, probably to prevent any mishaps.

An old woman, with a quilt tucked under her arm, comes out, looking very thin and pale. She looks at the two flags hanging on every household, shakes her head, and sighs, "Alas..."!

Walking out of the lane, heading east!

### Shanghai Today (8)

— Fan Xing

Huo Sang Detective Agency

### The Ballerina's Destination

— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter Ten: The Shoe Problem

Huo Sang then briefly told Ni Jinshou about the two facts he had gathered: that Li Zhiban had gone out, and that I had learned about this from Old Mao and Jin Mei. He also included the shoe we had found in the upstairs room. He then said: "When I arrived here, I saw He Sheng still at the corner across the street, but Song Quan was already gone. By the time I heard the gunshot and came out, He Sheng was also gone. I think these two men are very capable and won't mess things up."

I then realized that the man in black I saw on the corner of Datong Road when I arrived here must have been a plainclothes detective specially assigned to keep watch here. Although I didn't know this man, he was probably named He Sheng. He Sheng had probably followed Zhao Boxiong. It was only later that I learned that it was Huo Sang who proposed the dispatch of this plainclothes detective. After completing the inspection of the Wang residence that morning, Huo Sang told Ni Jinshou to withdraw the No. 99 police officer, while also quietly telling him to send two secret agents, which had a subtle effect.

Huo Sang then said to Ni Jinshou: "You'd better send two more people here. There might be other changes."

Ni Jinshou nodded and went back into the house to make a phone call. Huo Sang and I remained outside the door. I took the opportunity to ask: "Huo Sang, what did you find on Li Zhiban? It seemed like two pieces of paper. Right?"

Huo Sang nodded: "Yes, they were both receipts from the post office: one was a express mail receipt, and the other was a money order receipt." After he finished speaking, he turned around and headed west. His car was parked on the west side of the open space.

By the time he had opened the car door, Ni Jinshou had also come out of the house. Huo Sang beckoned to him, and the three of us got into the car together.

Ni Jinshou asked: "Where are we going?"

Huo Sang replied: "To the police station. I want to wait for news from He Sheng and Song Quan."

During the car ride, everyone remained silent. As the case progressed step by step, it rose higher and higher. Although the peak was in sight, it was still obscured by a thin layer of clouds, and the face of the highest peak was still unclear. Furthermore, like climbing a mountain, after ascending nine-tenths of a winding path, the final effort might actually be more difficult than before. I believe the three of us felt the same way, so everyone tacitly kept silent. (153)

### The Shaoxing Seven-County Native Place Association Over the Past Thirty Years

— Huang Yuzhai

It is my understanding that our Shaoxing Seven-County Native Place Association has been established for thirty years. Recalling the hardships of the pioneers who founded it, and looking forward to the great responsibilities of the future, we who live in this era and face these difficulties have an unshirkable duty to honor our ancestors and benefit our descendants. Therefore, this thirtieth anniversary celebration has a profound meaning.

Collective life begins with connection, and only through connection can there be unity. With unity, emotions will flourish. Our association has nearly 10,000 members, making it one of the three largest native place organizations in this city. Its strength is considerable, but it is still inferior to other native place organizations. Why is that? The people of Shaoxing are known for their hard work and frugality, which are indeed their strengths, but their closed-mindedness is also a flaw. They only know how to follow old ways and seek temporary peace, without thinking about improvement. Who knows that all things change with the great wheels of the times? What is considered an excellent idea or expression today may not be suitable for tomorrow. Moreover, in these times of global strife and increasingly complex social problems, the world is changing in unpredictable ways, and we must examine our environment, be practical, and strive not to become stragglers of the times. Otherwise, we will go against the current of society and face great danger.

Yuzhai is not talented, but you, gentlemen, have mistakenly entrusted me with the responsibility of preparing for the conference. I am ashamed of my inadequacy, and my strength is not equal to my ambition. Moreover, the smoke of war in my hometown has not yet dissipated, and the hungry are dying along the road. What is there to commemorate? However, as a fellow traveler from our hometown in Shanghai, I dare not refuse. In my opinion, this conference is primarily about connection, and I deeply hope that our fellow travelers in Shanghai will come enthusiastically. I also hope that all members will express their grand opinions on matters concerning the improvement of the association. If they are feasible, they will be adopted, so that we can gather our wisdom and open up new paths. With this belief, and with love for our hometown expressed in our words, we can flourish together.

Furthermore, our association has always been eager to establish education, and we have already established four primary and secondary schools, which we can be proud of. However, we still lack facilities for the treatment of illnesses among our fellow villagers, which is a regret. At this conference, under the leadership of Mr. Pei Yunqing, we decided to urgently prepare for the construction of the Zhejiang Shaoxing Hospital, which is also one of our priorities. However, this is a major undertaking that cannot be accomplished without 300,000 yuan. Yuzhai is willing to follow in their footsteps to promote its success, and I hope that we, the people of Shaoxing, can work together to achieve it.

### A Tour of Hollywood (Part Two)

— Sent by Cheng Zhizheng from Los Angeles

Soon, I saw a road sign that said I could go to Oriental Park from here. Following the signs, I found a Chinese-style palace on the mountaintop. After buying a ticket, I was led on a tour by a host. It turned out that the owner of this garden had previously done business in China and Japan, and later returned to the United States, collecting many oriental artifacts and treasures. As a result, he spent more than one million US dollars to build a completely oriental-style garden. The houses were mostly in the Chinese style, the gardens in the Japanese style. After touring for half an hour, I seemed to have forgotten that I was still in Hollywood!

The reporter visited the Fox Company's film studio and saw countless sets placed on the square. Many of the grand palaces, large hotels, and desert rivers we see on the screen are mostly fake. The large plane in the recent film "Foreign Correspondent" is actually just a large model, traveling through the air using radio waves, and after being enlarged, it looks no different from the real thing. The reporter saw this small plane with his own eyes, and it is said that it cost four thousand US dollars!

The residences of the big stars are located in the Beverly Hills area of the Vire Mountain. Huge buildings are connected to the clouds, and they are extremely luxurious. Movie stars' incomes are always around two or three thousand US dollars per week, so they can be considered the darlings of heaven. If tourists want to see stars in Hollywood, the only way is to wait in front of the theaters where the premiere ceremonies are held. That night, the reporter happened to be in Hollywood, and "Foreign Correspondent" was being premiered that night. The colored searchlights in front of the theater flashed into the sky, making the night scene even more fiery. Many stars were invited to participate that night, so grandstands were built on both sides of the theater, and the people were so crowded that those who came later had to stand on the road. The reporter was limited by time and had no intention of waiting!

After a whole day, I had almost completely toured the whole town of Hollywood. On the way back to Los Angeles in the evening, I looked at the radiant light of Hollywood from afar, fully displaying the heroic posture of the capital of the film kingdom. When will I come back for another tour? I was fantasizing.

### Lu Fulan Discussion (Part 2)

— Weiwei

Fulan is good because he received instruction from an accomplished master, underwent rigorous discipline, and put in hard work. Consequently, his foundation is superior to that of ordinary people. Because of his solid foundation, his strengths naturally arise from it. For example, when performing the pheasant feather dance, one can see his skill with the pheasant feathers; when performing the armored warrior plays, one can see his skill in wearing the armor; when performing the short-fighting plays, one can see his skill in wearing the belt. Although these are minor details, they are impossible to achieve without a substantial foundation. It can also be said that Fulan's only outstanding quality lies in the word "beauty." His movements are clean and crisp, his postures and stances are aesthetically pleasing, and every gesture is graceful. His footwork clearly shows his training. Every time one sees him leave the stage, he moves swiftly like the wind, without the slightest disarray, and his steps are in perfect sync with the drum beats, truly a spectacle to behold. In addition, Fulan can adhere to established rules and does not deviate from the original prototype, which is also commendable. Furthermore, his enunciation is also excellent, and he has a deep understanding of Kunqu melodies. Fulan is capable of performing all the melodies of martial arts plays, which is worth mentioning.

Deficiencies　It is preferable for martial arts actors to be tall and large, but Fulan is short in stature, which is one of his deficiencies. Because of his short stature, his performance in armored warrior plays lacks power, and his performance in painted-face roles lacks imposingness. This is his second deficiency. His nearsightedness has a negative impact on his performances, which is his third deficiency. His voice is thin and narrow, lacking resonance, which is his fourth deficiency.

Masterpieces　Most martial arts actors today follow either the Yang (Xiaolou) or Shang (Heyu) schools. Those who follow the Yang school invariably consider plays such as "The Linked Rings," "Evil Tiger Village," and "Changban Slope" as their masterpieces, while those who learn from Shang consider plays such as "Heroic Righteousness," "Battle of Chuzhou," and "Battle of Siping Mountain" as their masterpieces. Fulan has more masterpieces than any other martial arts actor, and many of them are plays that others do not excel in. His most famous plays include "Battle of Puyang," "The Eight Great Hammers," "Flower Picking," "Night Flight," and "Centipede Ridge," which can be called unparalleled at the time. Other plays such as "Picking the Sliding Cart," "Attacking Zidu," "Unicorn Pavilion," as well as "Gathering of Heroes," "Meeting at Lin Kou," and "The Odd Meeting," which are young male roles, are also beyond the reach of ordinary performers.

Conclusion　Comparing Lu Fulan's strengths and weaknesses, we should recognize Fulan as a rare talent in martial arts acting, as his strengths are not possessed by the average person. In other words, there is no martial arts actor today who possesses Fulan's strengths. As for Fulan's weaknesses, such as his short stature and nearsightedness, they are inherent and not due to human effort, and there is room for sympathy. If someone were to ask me who is better, Fulan or Sun Yukun? We can make a side-by-side observation of the plays they have performed. Although Fulan is not good at performing painted-face roles, his short-fighting plays, armored warrior plays, and young male martial arts plays are far broader than what Yukun can achieve. Yukun, on the other hand, excels at performing painted-face roles and is better at performing armored warrior plays, but he cannot perform young male martial arts plays and does not often perform short-fighting plays. From this, we can determine the measure of the two men.

A Fine Tale of Yue Opera

### Yuan Xuefen Has a Bodhisattva's Heart

— Dashu

— Performing "Guanyin Attaining Enlightenment" to Aid Starving People

Since Yue opera became popular in Shanghai, two famous actors have emerged, both performing at the Great Coming Theater: the young male actor Ma Zhanghua and the female lead Yuan Xuefen. Although both came from Shanxi and belonged to the same troupe, and often performed in the same play, their worldly fates and experiences are different, just like their innate natures. Ma gained the favor of a wealthy woman from Ningbo, who hired him as her son and daughter-in-law with a generous dowry. Yuan Xuefen, although younger than Ma, being only nineteen years old, is serene, refined, and deeply elegant. Among actors, she is a rare find in terms of character. Her acting is truly profoundly depicted and delicately fitting, sometimes solemn and dignified, sometimes romantic and dashing. Who knew that after her performances, she had two years. Therefore, she performs plays that benefit the world and people's hearts, and her performances are true to life. Whether it is Liu Xiangnu or Guanyin Attaining Enlightenment, the theater is always full. Women in the audience, seeing her, often shed tears and share tears of sympathy, change their ways for the better, and deepen their thoughts of filial piety. Recently, rice prices have been high, and the livelihood of the poor has become increasingly difficult. In the streets and alleys, starving people are everywhere. A certain charity association, feeling compassion, distributes free meals every month to help the poor. Many people benefit from this, and the long-term operation requires a large sum of money. Yuan, who is also a member of the association, seeing that the good deed cannot be interrupted and that fundraising cannot be delayed, voluntarily decided to perform free charity performances, without makeup, without applying powder, with long sleeves covering her arms, and a cloth robe covering her body, completely different from her appearance on stage. As a female actor, and a female lead, her actions are like this, and people secretly suspect that it is unlike her, but they do not know that Yuan's father, named Songmao, made a living by teaching reading, and had family learning from himself. Therefore, she is like hemp growing in a field of hemp, standing out from the crowd. Xuefen loved watching Yue opera when she was young. At the age of twelve, she followed a teacher to learn opera. Because of her meticulous performance, excellent singing and acting, and demeanor of a master, she was praised by the literati in Yuezhong. After traveling to Ningbo and Hangzhou, she traveled to Shanghai, where she won widespread praise and became famous in her time. She once received guidance from famous people, saw through the world of mortals, and resolved to observe a long vegetarian fast for two days, using the proceeds to provide free meals and winter relief. Therefore, it was decided to borrow the Renewal Stage on the 4th and 5th of November to perform the complete version of "Guanyin Attaining Enlightenment" for two days. This play is Yuan's masterpiece, and everyone who has seen it praises it. However, it is truly commendable and valuable for a female actor to be so enthusiastic about charitable causes and generous in social relief efforts. Therefore, great Buddhist laymen in Shanghai, such as Wen Lantings Huang Hanzhi, Guan Wangzhi, Feng Yangshan, Zhu Qichen, and women in the women's community such as Ms. Li Qiujun, are happy to sponsor it. There is no shortage of benevolent gentlemen in the world, and Yuan's actions will surely gain the sympathy of many people, provide great assistance, and achieve satisfactory results, which can be predicted.

### Record of Different Names for the Same Play (3)

— Yuchu

"The Changing Meeting" - A frivolous comedy about wives and concubines competing for love and jealousy. Also known as "Two Beauties Fighting for a Husband" and "Wives and Concubines Fighting for Favor."

"Battle of Changsha" - Also known as "Taking Changsha" or "Capturing Huang Zhong."

"Mulberry Garden Meeting" - Also known as "Sunflower Valley." Tells the story of Qiu Hu testing his wife's chastity with a gold horseshoe. Hence the names "Qiu Hu Teasing His Wife" and "The Gold Horseshoe."

"Imperial Stele Pavilion" - Also known as "Wang Youdao Divorcing His Wife" or "Joy of the Golden List."

"Splitting the Coffin" - Tells the story of Zhuangzi transforming into a butterfly to test his wife. Hence the names "Butterfly Dream" and "Zhuangzi Fanning the Grave."

"Shooting the Halberd at the Gate" - There is also a play called "Taking Little Pei," both using Lu Bu's resolving the conflict between Liu Bei and Ji Ling as the subject matter. The plot is the same, but the scenes are slightly different. Some say that the play without Guan Gong appearing on stage is called "Shooting the Halberd at the Gate." The one with Guan Gong is called "Taking Little Pei." Others say that the former stars a young male actor, while the latter stars a painted-face actor. Still others say that the reason why Guan Gong does not appear in "Shooting the Halberd" is because Ji Ling has red face paint, and Guan Gong also has a red face. It is not very pleasing to see the two of them on the same stage. Moreover, Guan Gong does not occupy an important position in this play, so he does not appear.

### New Arts Company Stages New Play

— Ruiqing

The New Arts Company initially decided to publicly perform "Hero of the Seas" for two weeks, and although they suffered slight losses due to "natural disasters and human misfortunes," the actors' compatibility and the fact that many audience members braved the rain to come gave them great excitement. Therefore, now that they have had a slight breather, they are preparing for a second public performance. There are two plays planned: one is "The Assassination of Jing Ke" and the other is "The Fragrant Concubine." The former is written by Wei Ruhui and will be directed by Fei Mu, and "Jingchai" will be played by Ying Yin. However, Ying Yin is currently in collaboration with the public to film "Sai Jinhua," so the rehearsals will have to wait until after the film is finished. "The Fragrant Concubine" is written and directed by Zhu Shilin, and Wang Xichun plays the Fragrant Concubine – they are the original cast of the movie "The Fragrant Concubine," so adapting it for the stage should be easy for them.
