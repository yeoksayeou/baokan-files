### Franco-Japanese Negotiations in Vietnam Resume; Both Sides Receive Instructions from Vichy and Tokyo; Air Traffic Between Hanoi and Kunming Suddenly Suspended

Hanoi – The Japanese military delegation and the Vietnamese authorities resumed negotiations last night after receiving instructions from Vichy and Tokyo, respectively. According to a public announcement by the Vietnamese government last night, the Franco-Japanese negotiations have resumed after the resolution of the “Tongtang” (transliteration) incident. The leader of the Japanese delegation, Nishihara, attended the meeting. The “Tongtang” incident mentioned in the announcement refers to the incident on September 6th when Japanese troops in Guangxi invaded the Vietnamese border at Tongtang. Japanese troops crossed the border at Tongtang on that day, but after the French military officers in the area took a firm stand, the Japanese troops retreated.

Editorial

### The Use of Wartime International Propaganda

History tells us that in every war, in addition to military force and material resources, the use of propaganda also occupies an important position. Effective propaganda can hinder the enemy's actions or accelerate their defeat. Conversely, if propaganda is poorly executed, it often does more harm than good.

The result of the Franco-Prussian War in 1870 was the destruction of the Second French Empire, which is well known. At the beginning of its establishment, the "First Republic" signed a treaty of cession and indemnity with the victorious Prussia. At that time, in a short period of ten months, Prussia, a rising star, was able to defeat the once prominent French Empire of the 1856 Paris Conference era. This was of course due to the premeditated diplomacy of the Iron Chancellor Bismarck and the commanding strategies of General Moltke, but the strengths and weaknesses of the propaganda methods used by both sides were also a decisive factor that cannot be ignored.

Bismarck's most skillful and lauded propaganda by later historians was two events: the so-called "Ems Dispatch" and the "Franco-Prussian Draft Agreement" regarding Napoleon III's attempt to annex Belgium.

Originally, when the Spanish throne issue aroused French dissatisfaction, the French ambassador had sought William, King of Prussia, to prevent Prince Leopold from accepting the Spanish throne and to guarantee that no member of the Hohenzollern royal family would ever inherit the Spanish throne. William accepted the first request but considered the second request to be too overbearing and was unwilling to answer. At that time, he telegraphed Bismarck from the city of Ems, detailing the negotiations with the French ambassador. Bismarck was in Berlin, extremely frustrated with the weakness of King William's attitude. After receiving the telegram, he had a flash of inspiration and intensified the tone of the original telegram, publicly releasing it on July 14, the French National Day. As General Moltke said, "Originally, it seemed like a conversation between William and the French ambassador, but after being edited, it seemed like William disdained to negotiate with the French ambassador and became a strong response to the challenger." Bismarck had long determined that in order to seek domestic development and foreign expansion, a war with France was inevitable and predicted that after the publication of this telegram, France would definitely take the path of war first and bear the responsibility of starting the war. As expected, the French government was irrepressible and officially declared war on Germany on the 19th.

At this time, while France was actively preparing for war, it was also planning to win over allies. However, Bismarck had already anticipated this and, before France could achieve any diplomatic success, took the initiative and handed over the "Belgian Agreement Draft," which France had proposed but had not signed four years prior, to The Times of London for publication. This draft proved that France also had the ambition to invade Belgium. As a result, no country, including Britain, was willing to give France any assistance.

Bismarck's first piece of propaganda achieved the goal of starting a war with France and established the fact that France was guilty of starting the conflict. The second piece of propaganda completely isolated France. He truly deserves to be called the most successful wartime propagandist in history. Looking at France, before the declaration of war, the Minister of War actually publicly said to Napoleon III: "Every detail, such as the last button on the last boot of the last soldier, is prepared." However, in reality, everything was in chaos: "Soldiers could not find their officers, artillery had no bullets, and officers lacked maps." In this way, the bold words of the Minister of War, which were originally intended to calm people's hearts, instead backfired. This is an example of poor propaganda.

Taking this European war as an example, France's defeat was also due in part to the false propaganda. In the past, the effectiveness of the Maginot Line was obviously exaggerated too much. At the same time, the fact that Germany could not last long and dared not fight a decisive battle was also understated too much. As a result, the soldiers gradually became contemptuous of the enemy, and the people became too lazy. Until the eve of the German advance and the fall of Paris, everyone still thought that the front-line battles could easily turn defeat into victory. No one dreamed that they would fall into such a state of irreversible decline.

The above are historical relics, but they all have their indelible educational value. The belligerent countries should learn from the past and know what to strive for. At the same time, all observers in the world should review the atmosphere created by the international propaganda of various countries today and gain a more accurate understanding.

### Roosevelt Orders Expansion of Aircraft Embargo to Include Aircraft Engineering Drawings and Designs; Government-Approved Exemptions Apply

Washington – President Roosevelt yesterday expanded the scope of the aircraft oil embargo to include parts and manufacturing methods for American aircraft and aircraft engines. President Roosevelt also ordered that all machinery used to manufacture aircraft fuel must obtain a permit before being allowed to leave the country. This move will prevent domestic manufacturers from selling such equipment to countries outside the Western Hemisphere. This proclamation supplements the May 1st export permit regarding aircraft engines and the July 26th export permit regarding oil, aluminum, and scrap iron. (14th United Press Dispatch)

Washington – President Roosevelt issued a proclamation prohibiting the sale of aircraft and aircraft engine manufacturing drawings and designs to foreigners, except those specifically approved by the US government. The same ban also applies to equipment used to manufacture gasoline and drawings for the manufacture of such equipment. (14th Reuters Dispatch)

Tokyo – According to various newspapers, the economic pressure exerted by the US government on Japan is increasing. Crude oil used to manufacture gasoline for aircraft will also be included in the list of prohibited exports. This attitude is clearly a "provocative act." Although the above news has not been officially confirmed, the Japanese authorities have paid considerable attention to it. (14th Havas Dispatch)

The auxiliary rules stipulate that the whole country participate in this movement, etc. The official name of this movement has not yet been selected. It is reported that Army Minister General Tojo has agreed to represent the army in participating in this movement. However, with the exception of the Army Minister, the Vice Minister of the Army, and the Director of the Military Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of the Army, who may participate in politics due to their positions, they will be granted special permission to participate in the "nerve center" of this movement in the capacity of advisors or consultants. Other army personnel on active duty may not join this nerve center. The Army Minister also stated that the Navy has the same opinion. The New Political System Movement is scheduled to be announced on the 17th of this month, at which time the organization and staff list of the "nerve center" of the movement will also be announced. The Preparatory Committee will be dissolved after meeting on the 17th of this month. (14th Reuters Dispatch)

### Japanese Aircraft Attack Sichuan Yesterday Afternoon; Bombing South Bank of Yangtze River; Most Bombs Fall in Mountainous Areas; Six Japanese Aircraft Shot Down Day Before Yesterday

Chongqing – This afternoon, Japanese aircraft again bombed the south bank of the Yangtze River. Most of the bombs fell in the mountains far from the river. Japanese aircraft did not appear over Chongqing, only flying over the suburbs. The sound of the explosions could only be faintly heard here. According to official sources, in yesterday's air battle over Bishan, six Japanese bombers were shot down near Bishan and Tongliang. It is reported that several more were severely damaged. One Chinese aircraft did not return to base. The pilot was killed and three were injured. The injured all landed their aircraft safely. (14th Reuters Dispatch)

Chongqing – It was learned today that during the Japanese air raid on Chongqing on Thursday, copies of the Shanghai Xin Shenbao of August 11 were dropped. This newspaper contained a Reuters Chongqing dispatch stating that after the US ban on oil exports, the Japanese wanted to conserve gasoline and abandoned large-scale bombing of Chongqing. (14th Reuters Dispatch)

Chongqing – Yesterday afternoon, 36 Japanese aircraft, divided into three teams, attacked the western suburbs of Chongqing and the south bank of the Yangtze River. It is reported that three were shot down by the Chinese. The Japanese used super-giant bombs, so the damage was considerable. The sound of the explosions caused eardrums to ache for those in air raid shelters half a mile away. One air raid shelter was hit by a bomb, and rocks fell, but only two people were slightly injured. The American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions in the western suburbs suffered heavy property damage. Its hospital and nurses' dormitory were completely destroyed, and the church school building was also severely damaged due to many bombs falling in the courtyard. The Japanese aircraft had attacked the church the day before (Thursday). The daytime attack took place at noon, and a total of 46 Japanese aircraft attacked the western suburbs of Chongqing and the south bank of the Yangtze River. The night attack began at 7:45 PM, but only three Japanese aircraft attacked. On Thursday during the day, six Japanese light bombers dived and attacked, opening machine guns at low altitude. The Shishi Xinbao office and the residence of foreigners in Jialing Dashun were damaged. Seven bombs fell near the residence of British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr. Thursday's dive bombing was the first time Japanese aircraft had done this in Chongqing, which is noteworthy. The Japanese began using light bombers on Thursday, carrying small bombs and quickly flying over Chongqing, taking only 45 minutes to fly from the Sichuan border to Chongqing. They came in small teams, whereas in the past, each attack always had 27 or 36 aircraft. But on Thursday during the day, they were divided into three teams of nine, eleven, and sixteen aircraft.

### Hunan Strictly Prohibits Rice Merchants from Hoarding and Speculating

Changsha – The counties along Hunan's lake region have always been known as rice-producing areas, and another bumper harvest has been reported this year, to the delight of everyone. Chairman Xue Yue, fearing that the market would manipulate food prices and that unscrupulous merchants would hoard and speculate, has specially formulated three measures for food control and issued them to the entire province for compliance. (1) The price of grain in the counties along the lake region is set at between 5.5 and 6 yuan per stone, and no increase is allowed. (2) The amount of food allowed to be stored by civilians is set at six stone per person. Grain merchants are allowed to regularly store and trade food, limited to 150 stone. Anything beyond that must be sold. (3) At least 80 percent of the public grain in the counties along the lake region should be purchased by the government. Anyone who dares to deliberately violate the above three measures will be charged with treason and aiding the enemy. In addition, Xue issued a personal order, stating that low grain prices hurt farmers, while high grain prices hurt the people. A balance between the two must be found so that both producers and consumers can benefit. He encouraged farmers and grain merchants to not aim to get rich and enjoy themselves in the midst of difficulties, but to aim for coexistence. (14th Dispatch)

### Military Political Department Drama Troupe Responds to Aircraft Donation Campaign

### United States Training Border Patrol Troops; Special School Established in El Paso

Washington - The U.S. Immigration Border Patrol is currently working hard to prevent the intrusion of foreign nationals and the "Fifth Column." The border patrol currently has 856 soldiers, but since the U.S. Congress passed a bill last month to recruit an additional 712 reserve soldiers, El Paso, Texas, as well as places in Mexico and Canada, are all training this talent. Currently, the El Paso school has several hundred people undergoing training. Each training class at the school is set for 100 people, and after these 100 people are trained, another 100 people are trained in rotation. Preliminary training is held on the border. It is expected that all trainees will be able to serve by the end of this month, and border patrol activities will soon be strengthened. Border patrol troops will be stationed at key points on railways and highways. This system of border patrol was established in Europe in 1928. The difference is that today's organization of these soldiers is much more advanced than in the past, and the equipment is also more perfect. The patrol team now has 500 fast cars, 14 speedboats, wireless equipment on the border, wireless lookout towers, and three quad-rotor aircraft. More than 100,000 types of fingerprints of foreign nationals are on file. If the situation deteriorates, thousands of U.S. Customs inspection teams and ranch patrol teams can rush to the border within one day to strengthen defenses. (14th International Dispatch)

### German Army and Air Force Commander-in-Chief Once in France; Intensifying Offensive Against Britain; British Military and Civilians Strengthen in Face of Danger; Arouse Anger and Resolve to Fight to the End

Basel, Switzerland - According to a Berlin dispatch received by the "National Daily" here, German Army Commander-in-Chief General von Brauchitsch and his staff have now met with Air Force Commander-in-Chief Goering somewhere on the French coast. People in Berlin generally expect the attack on Britain to intensify, as the previous attacks were only the first stage of the offensive. (14th Reuters Dispatch)

Berlin - The "Boersen" newspaper here predicted yesterday that Germany would launch an offensive against Britain immediately after the air raids on the British Isles. This is said to be the first time a German newspaper has made such a strong prediction. (14th United Press Dispatch)

London - The British people engaged in the war were very calm last night to await the attacks launched by Hitler. The King, Queen, and British people have all jointly experienced the taste of air raids, which is truly unprecedented. The German plan, as the German newspapers vowed, is to drive the British royal family out of London and separate them from the British people. However, the result is contrary to the Germans' expectations. Every Briton, especially the homeless, feels that the King and Queen are also suffering the same danger as the common people. Since Edward's abdication, the nation's pro-war royal family sentiment has become stronger than before. Everyone believes that Hitler's policy is truly terrifying. British officials say that because Germany cannot defeat the British air force, it is now trying to win by undermining British public opinion. Hospitals, museums, and residences are being bombed as much as military targets. German bombers have used high-explosive bombs, incendiary bombs, Molotov cocktails, and deep-penetrating aerial torpedoes. Millions of Londoners have tasted the fear of screaming bombs in the streets. They have learned how to jump out of bed in a hurry to extinguish the incendiary bombs thrown into their homes and how to leave their homes to avoid the explosion of time bombs. Despite these hardships, the spirit of Londoners is by no means discouraged. The people of London are indeed deeply annoyed by the bombing, but this usually gentle nation has gradually become angry and determined. Workers working in factories continue their work despite repeated air raid alarms and various unexpected difficulties. Even if their homes are often bombed and the supply of water and electricity is sometimes disrupted, women continue their business and housework with composure. The determination of the people has reached its peak. The government led by Prime Minister Churchill also firmly believes that it is not only able to cope with Germany's blitzkrieg but also to cope with Italy's large-scale attacks in Africa. Although various suggestions have been made to ask the government to move away from London, the government has decided to stay in London to the end. (14th United Press Dispatch)

### British Government Denies Relocation of Capital

London - The German claim that the King and Queen intend to leave London has been strongly denied here. The King and Queen, the Prime Minister, and other government officials have now fully decided to continue to stay in London. The Information Department recently issued a press release on the matter, saying that enemy radio stations have reported that the British government, the royal family, and the diplomatic corps will all withdraw from London. This news is absolutely unfounded. The origin of this rumor of the enemy is obviously based on the news released by the London representative of the Columbia Broadcasting Corporation. The interviewer has now asked us to declare on his behalf that the German interpretation of his remarks is completely misunderstanding its meaning. His original text is as follows: "Plans to leave London have been in preparation for more than a year, but I do not believe that serious consideration has been given to this step at present. The King and the government are currently in London, and unless the city becomes untenable, I believe they will stay." Therefore, the German report is deliberately reversing what the interviewer said. The Germans also reported that the diplomatic corps is now considering issuing a note to the British Foreign Office on the matter of evacuating London, which is only denied here. (14th Reuters Dispatch)

### The Current Air War in Britain Has Become a War of Main Forces; The Success or Failure of Britain's All-Out Resistance Hinges on This; The Old-Fashioned Naval and Land Battles Are Now a Thing of the Past

—A Warning Uttered by an American Military Expert—

New York - The well-known aviation expert and aircraft manufacturer Seversky, who commanded the Russian Royal Air Force in the previous European war, and whose aircraft and other contributions planned by Seversky are used in the current U.S. defense equipment. Seversky recently published an article saying that the "British War" can be resolved only by air combat, and does not necessarily require land invasion. Seversky's article stated that the huge air battles currently taking place in the skies over the British Isles are by no means a preliminary competition, as the old-fashioned military experts call it. This war is already a major duel. Anyone who wants to understand the importance of the current situation of the Anglo-German war must recognize this point. The military actions currently reported are generally regarded as the prelude to actual invasions or other large-scale naval and land attacks. However, the fact is by no means the case. What we are witnessing now is the real war. If Britain suffers defeat in the current war, then it will suffer the defeat of the entire war, or at least the defeat of the entire war in the motherland. If Britain fails, whether the victor decides to continue with the invasion of the island nation, or simply use the air force to systematically destroy this island nation without adopting other methods, is already a militarily insignificant issue. The reason why people in the world do not fully understand this situation is because they have failed to fully understand the form of the Anglo-German war currently in progress. This is the first time in the history of warfare that a pure and single air war has been discovered. Old-fashioned naval and army personnel do not know that the navy and army have now become onlookers in the fierce air war. It should be known that naval battles and land battles have evolved into unprecedented large-scale air wars, and the victory or defeat of the war seems to be determined by air battles. As for the general belief that 50 U.S. destroyers are enough to save Britain, it is also committing the same error due to seeking to understand this important air war. It should be known that the dangerous outcome can be determined without the navy engaging in war. Those who do not understand the tactics of 1940 all believe that the old-fashioned war will follow this air war. Therefore, it is said that Germany's attack on Britain at this time is only the preparatory stage for a future regular land conquest war. But in fact, some new things will immediately become clear, and those who do not understand the true meaning of air warfare will recognize the power of this new weapon. When the problem of winning the skies over the British Isles and the coastal skies is accurately answered, it can be known that the assistance of the land and air forces is very weak. In my opinion, Britain's allies at this time seem to be able to avoid expressing fear. The aerial offensive is developing as people expected. The challenger has a numerical advantage, while the defender has a substantial advantage. Judging from the news currently reported, the Germans do not seem to have broken through the British defense line. Unless Hitler's air force can cause extremely serious damage to the British mainland in daytime air raids, we have no reason to be afraid. In my opinion, the term "blitzkrieg" is very inappropriate for the air war currently in progress. The term "siege" to describe the tactics at this time is much more appropriate than the absurd "blitzkrieg" label. Britain is now protected by aerial fortresses on all sides, and the attackers are exerting their strength in an attempt to break through them. In every siege in the past, the number of aircraft of the besieged was far less than that of the attacking enemy. Each time was like another war to deal with the siege. The besieged were subjected to great pressure and were overworked in the danger of continuing to consume manpower and resources, and worked hard to maintain the spirit of resistance under pressure. Therefore, the aerial barriers and nerves of British aviators have undoubtedly been supporting them with all their strength. If there is a sudden change in the weather, such as clouds and fog that do not dissipate in the air for several days, it may be beneficial to Britain, because it can enable Britain to repair its aircraft and allow the long-fought personnel to rest slightly to prepare for future fierce battles. The purpose of this siege, in general, is nothing more than (1) to actually occupy Britain, (2) to implement an air blockade to trap the British in distress, or (3) to destroy all industries and transportation. However, in any case, the prerequisite for the Nazi Party is to eliminate or weaken the British Royal Air Force. Hitler's greatest air power has not yet been proven to have this ability, so it is still too early to talk about victory or defeat. No matter what damage the southeastern ports of Britain suffer, as long as Britain can still control the skies over Britain, the Nazis will not be able to achieve a decisive result. If the skies over Britain are still under British control, the Nazi troops will be useless even if they land. If Britain cannot control its airspace, then the Nazis can conquer Britain without sending troops to land, because the gateway to Britain has already been opened and there is no ability to resist the arbitrary killings carried out by the Germans from the air. This aerial war cannot be concluded in a few weeks or a few months, and it will make people realize that aerial power can defeat the enemy without occupying land. However, we in the United States should take this terrible fact as a lesson and seek ways to ensure national security. The sooner this is realized, the more beneficial it will be to the country.

### Italian-German Military Mission Active in Syria, Attempting to Obtain Naval and Air Bases

Cairo - According to Beirut news in the newspapers here, the activities of the Italian military mission in Syria show the purpose of the Axis policy, which is to exploit all the means of resistance in Syria, so that Italy can take and have Syria as soon as possible. Germany and Italy seem to want to use Syria and Lebanon as their military bases to attack the Near East. The Syrian people are therefore greatly angered and determined to resist the Axis countries' attempt to achieve this goal. The British and Turkish governments are closely watching the development of the situation in Syria. (14th Reuters Dispatch)

Cairo - According to reliable information from Syria received by Reuters, the French in Syria are now increasingly inclined towards General de Gaulle. This growing trend is aided by two reasons: one is the bravery shown by Britain during the German air raids, and the other is the response of the French tropical territories in Africa to de Gaulle. Although newspapers cannot freely express themselves, the French in Syria have managed to find foreign news. There are signs of dissatisfaction with the Petain government in Syria. It is reported that after the first batch of Italian military experts arrived in Syria, civilian and air force experts will also go there. It is also reported that a German mission has also set out for Syria and has now arrived in Istanbul. Anti-Italian sentiment in Syria is increasing day by day. It is reported that the French are strongly rejecting Italian demands. The Italian demands on Syria include (1) immediately handing over air bases, (2) handing over railway management rights, and (3) handing over several French submarines docked in the port of Beirut. In a nutshell, the situation in Syria has now reached a boiling point. Its future actions will be no more than two paths: (1) a sudden coup by the de Gaulle party, or (2) individual passive resistance. The so-called passive resistance is to refuse to disarm and wait for the opportunity for military action. (14th Reuters Dispatch)

### German Aircraft Indiscriminately Bombarding London Day and Night; Raids Become Increasingly Fierce; Yesterday, They Again Broke Through the Defense Line and Invaded the Central Area of London; The Roar of Anti-Aircraft Guns and the Sound of Explosions Blended into One

Stockholm, Sweden - London issued its second air raid alarm at 8:28 this morning, and it was lifted at 8:42. (14th Huitong News Agency Dispatch)

London - The air raid alarm issued in London at 8:02 last night was not lifted until 4:25 this morning, lasting a total of eight and a half hours. According to an official communiqué, the German air raids last night were mostly concentrated in the London area and a certain city in South Wales. Bombs fell on many parts of London and its suburbs, with the southeast and southwest areas suffering the most damage. Houses and factories in several areas were damaged, and there were several fires, but they have now all been extinguished. High-explosive bombs and incendiary bombs fell on a certain city in South Wales, and there was slight damage to houses. The number of casualties is currently unknown. (14th Reuters Dispatch)

London - Germany's aerial blitzkrieg on London is becoming increasingly fierce. Last night, the city was subjected to the fifth attack in 24 hours. The most recent air raid began at 8:02 p.m. on the 13th (5:02 a.m. Shanghai time today) and had not been lifted by midnight. London was attacked all night, covered by almost constant artillery fire. In 24 hours, German aircraft flew over the city for 14 and a half hours. The air raid records are as follows: From 8 p.m. to 4:55 a.m. on the night of the 12th to the 13th, from 6:37 a.m. to 7:32 a.m. on the 13th, from 8:40 a.m. to 12:50 p.m., from 2:55 p.m. to 3:13 p.m., and from 8:02 p.m. onwards, the alarm has not yet been lifted.

During last night's air raid, the sky was clear, the moon was silver, and the anti-aircraft guns around London were firing fiercely. The explosion of the shells emitted dark red and yellowish-white flashes. Several enemy planes flew past the outer line and sneaked into the central area of London. Within a few minutes, there were no pedestrians on the street. Only shrapnel was falling, or whizzing past the windows. The glass was shattered. After a while, the roar became louder, and the anti-aircraft guns also opened fire, mixed with lighter artillery fire, rumbling together. The sentiments of this air raid can only be known after the alarm is lifted and reports are collected from the bombed areas.

During the daytime raid yesterday, one German plane dropped three bombs in London after the alarm was lifted, near a certain hospital and a certain sanatorium, injuring two people. Another bomb destroyed six houses and a public library, injuring eight people.

During the second air raid in London yesterday, a bakery and a laundry, each employing hundreds of people, were hit by bombs, but there were no deaths or injuries, because the employees all took refuge in air-raid shelters, and although the houses were partially destroyed, the air-raid shelters were unharmed. During the third air raid, an enemy plane dived towards London, and after a while, it rose and dropped high-explosive bombs and incendiary bombs, causing houses to catch fire. Dozens of pedestrians in the road lay prone on the roadside, and some ran to air-raid shelters. Another enemy plane swooped down from the low clouds and dropped five bombs in a certain area in the southeast. The gas pipe was blown up, but the fire was immediately extinguished. A communiqué from the Air Ministry stated that according to the detailed reports received, although enemy aircraft dropped bombs in many places during the attack on Britain on the 12th, there was no serious damage. The number of deaths and injuries in the London area due to the air raid on the night of the 11th was 110 deaths and 260 injuries. Yesterday afternoon, in addition to attacking London, enemy aircraft in squads dropped bombs in several places in the southeast. A certain town in the Essex area was bombed and slightly damaged, but no deaths or injuries were reported. Several civilian houses were destroyed, but in general, the extent of the damage and casualties was quite small. Yesterday, enemy aircraft adopted the method of suddenly attacking and quickly flying back, and dropped bombs in a certain place in central London and several places in Kent. There were not many casualties, but the details are currently unknown. (14th Reuters Dispatch)

London - It is now learned that the British House of Lords was hit by an incendiary bomb during the recent air raid and was slightly damaged, but the fire was quickly extinguished. (14th Reuters Dispatch)

### Bombs Fall Near St. Paul's Cathedral; Northern Ireland Attacked by Air for the First Time

London - Yesterday, several mechanical engineers risked their lives to prevent the explosion of a "time bomb." The bomb fell near St. Paul's Cathedral and could have seriously damaged the historically famous building. The Press Association stated that a total of five unexploded bombs fell near St. Paul's Cathedral, one of which was a 500-pound bomb. Now, the area around the cathedral is cordoned off and heavily guarded. (14th Reuters Dispatch)

London - Northern Ireland was attacked by air for the first time since the start of the war yesterday. A batch of German aircraft dropped several incendiary bombs on the coastal town of Keijin in Northern Ireland, causing several fires, but they were quickly extinguished. According to the announcement, the damage was very light and there were no casualties. Ships off the coast of Northern Ireland were also attacked, but to no effect. (14th Reuters Dispatch)

### Time Bomb Exploded This Morning; Large Stone Pillar of Buckingham Palace Collapsed

London - A time bomb, one of the five bombs that fell near Buckingham Palace last night, suddenly exploded this morning. A large stone pillar of the palace gate, along with a part of the iron railing in front of the palace gate, was completely destroyed. The bomb fell in the middle of Buckingham Palace and the Victoria Memorial. After it was discovered last night, sandbags were immediately piled around it to reduce its explosive power. As a result, the Victoria Memorial was not damaged, and the doors and windows of the palace were not shattered. (14th Reuters Dispatch)

### British Aircraft Attack German Military Targets in Adverse Weather; Destroy Railway Transportation and Blow Up Warehouses; Inflict a Serious Blow to Germany's Invasion Plan

London - On the night of the 12th and the early morning of the 13th, large British bomber squadrons attacked German military targets. The extremely important railway intersection and warehouses in western Germany were heavily damaged, and Germany's invasion plan was once again dealt a serious blow. British aircraft took to the air for hundreds of miles, braving adverse weather, and achieved considerable success. Some of the bombed warehouses are the largest and best-equipped in Europe, and they must have a significant relationship with Germany's attempt to invade Britain. The deployment of troops and military supplies that Germany is moving westward to the ports of the English Channel must pass through these important transportation centers. The Air Ministry stated that the first batch of British aircraft arrived in Hamm before 10 p.m., braving dense clouds and rain, and dropped huge bombs and incendiary bombs on the warehouses. The warehouses in Elan, near the Luxembourg border, were attacked. A column of trucks was hit by huge bombs, causing several explosions, and the fire was raging. The avenue south of the warehouse was also hit by bombs, exploding loudly. Two British bombers flew to Osnabrück, attacked through dense clouds, causing ten large fires in the warehouses. The warehouses and railways in Essen, Schwert, and Emmerlek were also attacked. Recently, German military transport passing through the warehouses in Brussels has been frequent. They were attacked by the British Air Force several times last week, and they were bombed again on the night of the 12th. As soon as huge bombs were dropped, continuous explosions were seen in the target area. A fire broke out on the north side of a warehouse, about one mile long. The explosion emitted green light, followed by another fire, about 200 yards long. At the same time, another batch of British aircraft flew to Emden to bomb the shipyards and gasoline depots for one hour. The head of the port and the ships were also bombed. After the gasoline depot was hit, thick smoke billowed in several places, and the flames soared. The British aircraft attacking Vlissingen saw that there were anti-aircraft gun defense ships arranged in a semicircle at the entrance of the port, and they bombarded them fiercely. The light and heavy artillery teams and anti-aircraft machine guns on the shore also opened fire at the same time. The British aircraft bombed fiercely, braving this fierce fire net. One of them flew low to 600 feet and dropped bombs, hitting the shipyard. The armory was probably also hit, because the fire was raging and the explosion was extremely loud. The British aircraft turned around and flew back to sea. Even twenty miles away, the fire could still be seen flashing. (14th Reuters Dispatch)

### British Navy Can Use American Bases; American Naval Experts Speculate

Washington - Naval experts and diplomatic experts here, after special research, expressed their opinions, saying that they firmly believe that if the British Navy is driven out by the German invasion and cannot stand in its own territorial waters, then the main ships of the British fleet will obtain the right to use one or more U.S. naval bases on the Atlantic this winter. Reliable diplomatic circles say that it would not be surprising even if this negotiation is "about to be concluded." It is expected that the fuel supply docks of the naval shipyards in Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and Norfolk are all needed by Britain, because these are the only places in the naval bases in the Western Hemisphere that have the equipment to supply main battleships. The government leaders do not want to leave behind a handle for such a major event, so when asked, they often answer, "Please ask the White House." However, President Roosevelt also refused to give a direct answer to this question when he received reporters yesterday. (14th International Dispatch)

### London Citizens Have Not Slept for Seven Nights

Madrid - According to a report from London, when the fourth alarm in London was issued last night, the citizens were informed that it was the seventh sleepless night. During the previous three air raids, the citizens were unwilling to run into the cellars, but after hearing that many people were killed by bombs in the docks, they had to go into the air-raid shelters. Yesterday, many factories and warehouses in London were hit by bombs and caught fire. Several cities on the southeast coast of England also had bombs dropped, but the British authorities checked the news very strictly, and the situation is unknown. (14th Huitong Dispatch)

### Soviet Rights on the Danube River: Germany Willing to Respect Them; Navigation Talks to Invite Soviet Participation; Germany and Italy Prepare to Protect Romanian Borders

Berlin – Sources well-informed in German circles here declared yesterday that Germany will accept the Soviet government's warning and recognize that the Soviet Union is a country bordering the Danube River. All resolutions concerning the Danube River region should invite Soviet participation. A German spokesperson said, "We are aware that there are no difficult problems to be faced in this matter, and we absolutely respect all the rights of the Soviet Union as a Danube River nation." The spokesperson did not feel that the Soviet Union's protest to Romania regarding border conflicts was particularly important. He stated, "Whenever there are changes in border lines, small frictions easily arise. We sincerely hope to resolve this matter before encountering significant difficulties." (United Press dispatch, 14th)

Berlin – The "German Diplomatic Political Correspondence," mouthpiece of the German Foreign Ministry, commented on the end of the Danube River International Commission, believing that the Western powers could no longer intervene in the Danube River issue. The safety of international navigation on the Danube River should be guaranteed as much as possible, but this work cannot be competently handled by politicians and should be managed by experts in order to maintain Central Europe's transportation. (Haitong dispatch, 14th)

Bucharest – The arrival of high-ranking German and Italian generals in Curtea de Argeș and the arrival of Italian officials in Galați indicate that the Axis powers are preparing to protect the Romanian border in accordance with the Vienna Agreement. After the establishment of the German-Soviet Bessarabian agreement, German officials and stormtroopers were stationed in Galați to protect the evacuation of German nationals. Some believe that the reason for the arrival of Axis officials here may be related to the Soviet Union's request for Germany to explain its intentions regarding the Danube River region. (Associated Press dispatch, 14th)

Bucharest – The Soviet Union sent a note to Romania protesting the border incident that occurred on Wednesday, and anxieties regarding the strain in Soviet-Romanian relations have increased. The poor border situation has persisted for several weeks, and there have long been rumors that the Soviet side has massed large forces along the new border of the Prut River. Another noteworthy development is the appearance of 1,500 uniformed German personnel near the Danube port of Galați. They have come here ostensibly to handle the evacuation of the German minorities in the Soviet-occupied provinces of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina. However, political circles here point out that the Soviet Union's actions towards Germany regarding the Danube River are the first instance of conflict with Germany because what the Soviet Union says contradicts the German claim that Romania's existing territories are all within Germany's economic sphere. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)

Bucharest – Romanian political circles deeply believe that Berlin, having already assumed the role of Romania's protector, will certainly relieve Romania of its difficulties. They are not concerned about the Soviet Union's protest last night regarding the border conflict. Official circles believe that even though the Soviet Union has sent a note to Berlin requesting detailed information about the Vienna Conference, especially regarding the Danube River issue, there will be no disputes between Germany and the Soviet Union. They also claim that the German-Soviet talks regarding the exchange of Bessarabian populations have significantly improved relations, which is completely contrary to what is being reported abroad. (United Press dispatch, 13th)

### Romanian News: Postponement of Cabinet Formation; King Appointed Division Commander

Bucharest – According to reliable sources, the formation of Romania's new cabinet will be postponed until the 16th or 17th. However, a portion of the new cabinet members has already been announced. It is widely expected that Iron Guard leader Horia Sima will be appointed Minister of the Interior. Currently, the Iron Guard has reached an understanding with General Antonescu. It is said that Brătianu will be appointed Foreign Minister, and the current Foreign Minister, Manolescu, may be transferred to the post of Minister of Economy or may serve as the ambassador to Germany.

### Hungarian Troops Complete Takeover of Romanian Ceded Territory; Boundary Demarcation Talks to Begin

Budapest – Hungary announced the completion of the takeover of the Outer Transylvanian territory yesterday. The area of the region is 43,591 square kilometers (including forests, salt mines, and gold mining areas). Hungary now has a total area of 160,757 square kilometers. The new Greater Hungary has a total population of 13.5 million. The border line occupied by Hungarian troops yesterday is only a temporary national border. The determination of the definitive border will be carried out locally by a mixed commission from both countries. Negotiations on the appointment of candidates for the commission will begin today at the Hungarian Foreign Ministry. Other unresolved issues regarding the cession of Outer Transylvania will be resolved during these negotiations. (Haitong dispatch, 14th)

Washington – General Pershing, commander of the American Expeditionary Forces in the last World War, celebrated his eightieth birthday yesterday. President Roosevelt personally awarded him the Distinguished Service Medal, expressing respect for the extraordinary achievements Pershing made on June 15, 1913. (United Press dispatch, 14th)

### Real Name of Trotsky's Assassin

Mexico City – It is believed here that the assassin of Trotsky is definitely named Torlgov, born in Romania. This was provided by a prisoner in jail, who stated that he knew Torlgov well and confirmed that the killer is Torlgov. (Haitong dispatch, 14th)

### United States to Establish Naval Base in Brazil; Roosevelt Preparing to Negotiate with Brazil

Washington – Only the blind would say today that the United States is not rapidly preparing to participate in the world war. Various policies to avoid war have all developed into policies trending towards war. According to subtle official revelations, after President Roosevelt negotiates with Britain and Canada for the lease of bases, he will tour the southern states for political activities and then return to negotiate with Brazil to establish a US naval base in Brazil to defend the South Atlantic. The President's advisors are currently designing a "quarter-of-the-globe" defense system. It is rumored that an inner defensive line will be drawn in the Western Hemisphere, starting from Newfoundland, extending to a new naval base near Natal, Brazil, and then turning west, passing through Hawaii and reaching Alaska to protect half of the American coastline. The importance of the Brazilian base is due to the fact that whoever can control that area can control the vital passage from the east. The United States' second step policy will be to make greater use of the American fleet to bolster Britain's power. No one in the American army and navy doubts this. The larger American battleships and cruisers are maneuvering in the Pacific Ocean, which can now embolden Britain. If Britain is defeated before the natural development of American assistance, then the United States can take over the defense of Canada and join in. Only if Britain wins can the United States be spared. An American official made a bet that the United States would definitely participate in the war within four months. An American ambassador also said this. (International News Service dispatch, 15th)

### Famous Japanese Writer Vigorously Condemns Opportunism; Opposes Reckless Actions

Tokyo – The Nichinichi Shimbun recently published an article by the famous commentator Tokutomi Iichirō, vehemently denouncing those who advocate an opportunistic approach to Japanese foreign policy. He stated, "If Japan were to take advantage of Britain's preoccupation with the war against Germany and seize its interests in the Far East, this would be morally wrong and a reckless action. It should be known that taking advantage of others in distress to obtain benefits should be a source of shame for both countries and individuals. The small countries of the Balkan Peninsula, such as Romania, are accustomed to using this strategy to defend themselves and increase their value, but the result is ultimately failure. Romania's tragic dismemberment can serve as a warning. Certain strategists in our country believe that Germany's attack on Britain will gradually weaken Britain's power in the Far East, and Japan can take this opportunity to dominate East Asia at a minimal cost. We will leave this point aside for now, but what can be asserted is that Germany's intensification of pressure will only make Britain bow down to the United States and exchange all its wealth for American assistance. If Britain is forced to move its capital to Canada, then Hong Kong and Singapore will fall into the hands of the Americans. In short, the international situation is becoming increasingly dangerous, and our country's future difficulties will only increase." (Havas dispatch, 14th)

### Random Notes on the European War (6): From Paris to Bordeaux

This is a report of France's total collapse, in two parts. The first part was written by a former Paris correspondent for the British Manchester Guardian, originally published in the newspaper's weekly edition on June 28. The second part was sent from Lisbon by Ralph Delahaye Paine, head of the European branch of the American "Life" magazine, originally published in "Life" on July 8. The translations are presented separately below:

A British Newspaper's Record

Early morning on June 11th, I left Paris and later stayed in Tours and Bordeaux, France. I witnessed the residents of Paris, young and old, fleeing to the countryside, a truly tragic scene. I was in Tours during a bombing. Although I was not strafed by German planes along the way, I spoke with many refugees and learned that the extent of German planes killing refugees along the way in France was clearly incomparable to the experiences of refugees in other areas.

I lived in Paris for fourteen years and have a deep affection for Paris and its residents. Hearing that the German army would arrive at any moment, I had no choice but to flee in a panic. My heart was burning when I set off, and I was filled with countless emotions. My poor writing cannot describe even a fraction of it. I suddenly rushed to leave, leaving behind 5,000 books, which is nothing compared to other losses. Even leaving behind helpless friends in Paris is just a trivial matter in the midst of a great disaster.

I will never forget my last night in Paris. That day, the sun was blazing, the weather was muggy, and thousands of cars were leaving the city in a continuous stream all day long. In the afternoon, the main roads were still extremely congested. I decided to take a walk on the streets one last time and saw that the Avenue de l'Opéra was as normal as ever, which was quite surprising. The shops along the road were still stocked with goods, and one cinema was still showing movies non-stop. I walked into a familiar coffee shop, but the owner had left, leaving only an old, overweight waiter in charge. The waiter greeted me with a smile and said that he expected the German army to enter Paris within forty-eight hours, but there was nothing to worry about because he had been captured by the German army during the last war and knew how to deal with fools.

By evening, the situation had completely changed. I drove from the Place de l'Opéra, through streets deserted by pedestrians, to Saint-Cloud, preparing to join three cars heading south to Tours. On the way, I saw a team of soldiers, dressed in tattered uniforms, lacking discipline, and many were drunk and shouting loudly. At sunset, the red light shone all over Paris, and there was a rare and strange black smoke covering the sky.

After arriving at a friend's residence on the summit of Saint-Cloud, I had an unobstructed view of Paris. After packing my luggage, I invited a friend to the balcony to look down, but we couldn't see anything because Paris was covered in a black smoke screen. This was clearly the smoke screen used by the German army that day to forcibly cross the Seine River, drifting east to the sky above Paris.

I will not go into detail about the journey from Paris to Tours, but will only describe the general outline. Normally, this journey would take three hours, but it took us fourteen hours to reach Tours. For the first twenty miles, military vehicles, various cars, and bicycles were everywhere, making it extremely difficult to drive. It took more than an hour to pass through Versailles. All around, it was dark, the car was bumpy, and the sound of wheels rumbled. The lights were dim, mixed with the shouts of military police, creating a chaotic scene. This was the sight of residents rushing to other places. After passing through Rambouillet, driving became a little easier and we entered the Beauce plain.

The villagers looked confused as cars loaded with boxes passed by in succession. Several roads were blocked by anti-tank guns, and in the woods were soldiers with weary faces, holding rifles and watching out for paratroopers. By the time we reached Chartres, the cathedral stood majestically, presenting a unique beauty of peace in the midst of the French people's suffering, but everyone we saw looked panicked and at a loss.

We soon arrived in Tours, and the scene we saw was like a nightmare. The streets and alleys were crowded with people, making it unbelievable. Houses and hotels were all overcrowded. Journalists, politicians, and familiar faces gathered in the cafes along the Rue Nationale. Small blue trams, ringing their bells, drove across the Pont de Pierre. Cars loaded with luggage came and went. It was said that the National Assembly would soon convene in Tours, and the authorities had requisitioned two hotels to serve as the meeting places for the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies. The Ministry of Information was located in a dilapidated old building.

We stayed in Tours for two days. By the third day, government officials were gradually disappearing. By noon, everyone had left, but we still stayed in Tours for another twenty-four hours. The Ministry of Information stopped repairing the walls halfway and abandoned them. On the afternoon of our last day in Tours, we were suddenly bombed. Twelve bombers flew low and dropped bombs, many of which fell near the airfield. We encountered another air raid the next morning.

The journey to Bordeaux was relatively peaceful. Most of the refugee cars had already passed, so driving was unobstructed. The scene in Bordeaux was extremely gloomy, with a slight sense of panic. It was known that the French government was holding an emergency meeting somewhere in Bordeaux and that Churchill had arrived in Bordeaux, but there was no definite news. Postal and telegraph censorship and telegraphic communication had almost stopped. Whether it was the local newspapers or the newspapers that had moved to Tours for a few days and then moved to Bordeaux, the news was very isolated. Even the fall of Paris was only announced vaguely, causing rumors to spread.

What was clear was that Reynaud at least wanted to continue fighting in North Africa, but those who advocated surrender were gaining momentum. The British expatriates in Bordeaux were quite anxious because if France signed an armistice, and the German army occupied the Atlantic port of Bordeaux in one night, what would happen? British expatriates went to the British Consulate to inquire about news in an endless stream. The British authorities finally informed the British expatriates to prepare to evacuate. The next day, we drove to Pointe de Grave at the mouth of the Gironde River, which was where the first American troops landed in 1917. After eating our meal under the monument, we were as heavy as lead, and we left French soil. We took a boat to board a British ship outside the harbor. The ship was originally designed to accommodate only 150 passengers, but thanks to the captain and crew's skillful handling, it carried no fewer than 1,500 passengers, and we were able to return to England safely.

After boarding the ship, a German bomber attacked again. The next day, another bomber flew overhead and was chased away, and it was shot down nearby. Just as our ship and another ship left French territorial waters, a destroyer arrived to escort us. At this last moment, looking back at the French coast, in the setting sun and golden rays, it gradually faded away until it was indistinguishable.

### American Authorities Advocate Maintaining Concessions and Courts Japanese Merchants Also Do Not Want Courts to Change First Special Court Denies Making Statements

Regarding the issue of the Shanghai courts, there have been many rumors recently. In reality, it seems that fewer of these messages come from the court itself, and more come from general speculation. According to reliable sources, the court is a state agency for the implementation of laws and has a critical relationship. The special district courts of the two concessions in Shanghai, in particular, are bound by agreements, and their position and responsibilities are closely linked to international operations. It is not appropriate for any party to make separate claims. The United States is a democratic country. At this time of global turmoil, it upholds justice and speaks out loudly. In the Far East, it adheres to its open-door policy as always. The White House executive will either not express anything about East Asia, or if it does, it will definitely take the actual implementation of the Far Eastern policy as its consistent and unchanging statement. Therefore, American authorities firmly advocate maintaining the status quo of the Shanghai Concession Court. If there are no drastic international changes, this statement is hardly questionable, and it is also unquestionable. Furthermore, the number of Japanese commercial firms that trade with Chinese has increased more than before the war. With frequent interactions, there are naturally many legal lawsuits. In the event of a change in the court, it would be very inconvenient based on past practices. Therefore, most Japanese merchants advocate protecting Chinese courts and are in a very dominant position.

Judges Rarely Ask About Foreign Affairs

Court officials, in addition to their own responsibilities, rarely ask about foreign affairs. It is even more inappropriate for them to publicly make statements or express opinions. Recently, Chinese and foreign newspapers in Shanghai have reported court news, sometimes in the form of direct statements from the court, or in a tone that indicates the actions of the entire court. According to reliable sources, all such statements were not made by the person in charge of the court, so the court cannot be responsible for them.

First Special Court Important Statement

The Jiangsu Shanghai First Special District Court sent a letter to this newspaper yesterday, saying: "To whom it may concern, in the past two or three days, the Chinese and English newspapers in this city have repeatedly published important news about our court, and some self-proclaimed staff members have made statements without authorization. The source of the interviews is unknown, and who made them is unknown. Regardless of how the events are described, how the words are phrased, or what the intention is, our court cannot be responsible for them. This statement is made specifically, and please publish the original text of this statement in a prominent position in the Xinlian column of your newspaper so that the public is aware of it. Sincerely, Shanghai First Special District Court, Jiangsu, September 14, 29th year."

Most Judges Move Into the Court

According to news this morning (14th), many court judges and other officials in the Shanghai Concession have moved into the court to live. It is reported that almost all judges and officials will move into the heavily guarded court dormitories within a few days. According to one official, the reason why the judges have adopted this method is that they have repeatedly received threatening letters, and because the court seal is tightly guarded and it is difficult for idlers to sneak in, this decision is considered the safest method at present. At the same time, the police department is continuing to implement precautionary measures to protect the judges.

### Two Deputy Directors of the Municipal Council Took Over Yesterday Cobb Left This Morning

Cobb, the Deputy Director of the Municipal Council, officially resigned from his position as Director of the Municipal Council yesterday. The newly appointed Acting Deputy Directors, Mr. Nash and Mr. Allen, also took over and assumed office yesterday, but there was no inauguration ceremony. However, they have begun to handle the routine official duties left by Cobb since yesterday. As for Cobb, he personally went to various departments of the Municipal Council yesterday morning to bid farewell. It is reported that Cobb will leave Shanghai by ship next week and go to Malaya to join the army and serve the country.

### Many Foreign Banknotes are Exported

### American Military and Political Officers Had Important Discussions Yesterday Many Believe They Were Discussing the Handover Problem Official Secrets Were Strictly Guarded Regarding the Content of the Discussions

The issue of the American Defense Forces taking over the central district of the Public Concession is still being discussed by the American military and political officers stationed in Shanghai. A reporter from Pingming News Agency learned from reliable sources yesterday that the American military and political officers stationed in Shanghai still held an important meeting at the American Consulate at 181 Jiangxi Road at around 10 a.m. yesterday. In addition to American Consul General Patrick, those who attended the meeting included Rear Admiral Glassford, Commander of the Yangtze River Fleet, Colonel Baker, Commander of the American Defense Forces Marine Corps stationed in Shanghai, and another senior officer of the American Defense Forces stationed in Shanghai. Colonel Baker was the one who came out after the meeting. This meeting was the second after Admiral Hurd left Shanghai. The reasons for their discussion are absolutely confidential and they do not want to disclose anything. However, according to other relevant sources, the American military and political officers' talks yesterday morning were still an important discussion on the issue of the American military taking over the central district, in order to wait for Admiral Hurd, commander of the American Asian Fleet, to arrive in Shanghai in the near future. Regarding the handover issue, there may be new developments at that time.

### Concessions to Take Special Precautions Starting This Week Expected to Pass September 18th Safely Prevention in the Western District Has Been Particularly Tight in Recent Days

The authorities of the two concessions in this city, with the "September 18th" anniversary approaching, have been planning, preparing, and arranging in recent days in order to maintain law and order and prevent unexpected incidents, taking precautions to ensure safety. The security measures in the concessions have also become increasingly strict, and special precautions will be taken from this week onwards, before and after the anniversary, with the strictest being on "September 18th." The situation is comparable to "August 13th." At that time, in addition to the full mobilization of police personnel, the defense forces of various countries stationed in Shanghai, such as the United States, France, and Italy, and the Shanghai Volunteer Corps will all be mobilized. Tanks and police vehicles will also be dispatched for patrol. The gaps in the barricaded roads in the central district of the Public Concession will be guarded by more British members of the Volunteer Corps to supplement the defense duties left by the British army. Therefore, it is expected that this "September 18th Anniversary Day" will be able to pass quietly under strict security.

French Concession Obtains Good Order

Since the French Concession announced special precautions on the 3rd of this month, traffic on various barricaded roads has been obstructed. The Zi Lin Western News and others have received letters from readers stating that it is inconvenient and difficult to enter and exit. According to the French Police Department, this measure is purely to ensure good order and maintain law and order within the territory, so it has been decided to continue to take it. Currently, only the barbed wire fence on the Songshan Road Kunlian Aiduoya Road, that is, the east side of the Hu Guang Grand Theater, has been removed. However, armored vehicles have been placed there, and Chinese and Western detectives have been stationed to check pedestrians. Security is still strict.

The Western District is Stepping Up Defenses

The police authorities of the Public Concession and the French Concession, with the anniversary of "September 18th" approaching, have implemented security measures in advance in order to ensure the safety of the Concession's order. Also, because the Western District is close to the badlands, the three iron gates at the entrance of the Yinghua Lane on Roberts Road have been closed, leaving only one empty passage for vehicles to travel back and forth. The intersection of Xinzha Road and Chengdu Road was once closed yesterday (leaving a gap), and a large number of armed police officers were stationed to conduct searches. There were also mixed patrol teams of Chinese, English, and Indian police, armored vehicle teams, and vehicle patrol teams patrolling and searching on various roads in the Western District. The French Concession authorities also strengthened security work in areas such as Changle Road and Xujiahui. The authorities in the central district of the two concessions have also stepped up the necessary measures for the barbed wire mouths and along the way.

### Post Office Cares About Southwest Mail Delivery

Mail delivery between Shanghai and various places in the Southwest, which was once suspended due to shipping from Shanghai's coastal defense, the Shanghai Postal Administration immediately loaded and opened several batches of Fujian provincial shipping lines to transfer to the inland and road transportation in order to clear the mail. However, taking this route takes far longer than taking the coastal defense route. According to the current transportation situation, mail transferred via the coastal defense takes about three weeks to arrive, while inland road transportation via Xiamen takes more than a month. Therefore, since the resumption of shipping from Shanghai's coastal defense, the post office has still loaded and transported mail to the southwest via coastal defense, which is very smooth. However, recent reports have stated that the Honghe border crossing bridge on the Sino-Vietnamese border has been destroyed. The post office is paying close attention to whether this will affect the Shanghai-to-Haiphong transportation of southwest mail. It is currently eagerly awaiting a report from the Haiphong postal authorities. However, according to the bureau's speculation, even if the bridge is destroyed, there must be ships that can ferry across. If this is the case, the postal route must be able to remain unblocked. Otherwise, the post office will have to consider other transportation routes. As for mail delivery between Shanghai and Zhejiang, most of it is now transferred to the land route via Shipu. The new route has not been abandoned, but only a small number of mails are transported. Shanghai-Fujian mail can now be reached via Fuqing.

### Flat-Price Coal Sales Ended Yesterday

The Shanghai Coal Industry Association sold flat-price coal jin from the 9th of this month: (1) Sales to the bath industry for two days, each household purchasing two tons, totaling 102 tons sold. (2) Sales to the cooked water industry for four days, each household limited to one ton, totaling more than 500 tons sold. The period has now expired and ended yesterday. As for the next sale, it is still awaiting a formal decision.

### Filling Out Cargo Lists Be Careful About Ship Capacity

Jianghai Customs General Affairs Section Notice (1) No. 114 states that, in the case of goods reported for shipment by merchants, if the goods are returned to customs, the shipping agent should immediately notify the boarding officer for the benefit of the reporting person, so that the goods can be confirmed as returned to customs. Otherwise, they will not be allowed to enjoy the benefits of returning the goods. Currently, refrigerated goods, finished tax goods, and perishable goods can be temporarily exempt from this procedure. All merchants, etc., should be informed of this. This notice is hereby given. (2) No. 115 states that, in the case of various shipping companies filling out cargo lists, if they do not consider the ship's capacity and fill them out arbitrarily, causing the reported goods to be returned to customs, they will not be allowed to enjoy the benefits of returning the goods. This matter was notified by this section in Notice No. 32 on March 10, the 23rd year of the Republic of China. If the cargo lists issued by various shipping companies exceed the ship's capacity again in the future, all goods listed in the list will not be allowed to enjoy the benefits of returning the goods if they are returned to customs. Please comply with this. This notice is hereby given.

### Municipal Federation Urges All Industries Not to Dismiss Employees

Commodities in Shanghai are expensive, and employees in various industries are suffering from livelihood difficulties. In this abolished Lunar Mid-Autumn Festival, personnel changes may be unavoidable. For this reason, the Shanghai Citizens' Federation appeals to the employers in various industries not to dismiss employees without reason, and to continue to improve employee benefits within the scope of their capabilities. At the same time, the association also hopes that the employees in the industry will not easily provoke disputes and will work hard in their respective positions to overcome the difficulties at this time when the Shanghai industry is encountering the most difficult period.

### Thrift and Nation-Building Stamps Sold on Double Tenth Festival

According to news from the Southwest Post Office, in order to promote thrift and nation-building among the people, the Ministry of Communications ordered the General Post Office to issue a kind of thrift and nation-building commemorative stamp. The style has been designed by the bureau and is extremely beautiful and solemn. The whole set consists of four kinds, each with a different value. The above-mentioned commemorative stamps have been sent to the Hong Kong Qishu Bookstore for printing last month. Recently, sample sheets have been sent to the Kunming Post Office for verification and approval. They can be printed and completed before the Double Tenth Festival and delivered to the whole country for issuance as scheduled. Shanghai can also ship them directly from Hong Kong to Shanghai for sale and add commemorative postmarks.

### Lone Army and White Russian Corps Twice Clashed Workers Repairing the Goal Angered the Lone Army The Two Sides Persisted Until Yesterday and the Problem Was Not Resolved

The English Great Beauty Evening News said that a brawl occurred at the Singapore Road Lone Army Camp this morning (14th). First, several coolies from the Municipal Council's Public Works Department went to the camp yesterday (13th) to repair the football field gate, which angered the Lone Army soldiers. After Chief Xie agreed that the coolies could go to repair it today, no incident occurred. However, when the coolies from the Public Works Department went to the camp this morning to carry out the repair, they again had a disagreement with the Lone Army soldiers and brawled. The White Russian Corps guarding the camp believed that the situation was serious and could not be handled, so two teams of the White Russian Corps rushed to mediate, and a team of police officers from the Public Concession also arrived to assist. It was heard that as a result of the brawl, several Lone Army soldiers and some coolies from the Public Works Department were injured. The claim that the White Russian Corps fired several shots into the sky to warn them could not be confirmed. An official from the Municipal Council said recently that the authorities are consulting with Chief Xie to end the disturbance, but so far in the afternoon, a satisfactory solution has not been obtained.

Repairing the Goal Caused a Conflict

The Zi Lin News said that at nearly 10:00 a.m. yesterday (13th), soldiers from the Lone Army Camp on Singapore Road and the White Russian Corps guarding the camp almost caused an incident. After mutual concessions from both sides, it finally ended peacefully. The incident occurred at around 9:00 a.m. yesterday when coolies from the Municipal Council's Public Works Department went to the camp to repair the football field gate. Chief Xie

objected, so more than a hundred Lone Army soldiers stood at the entrance of the football field. The coolies had to give up the repair work. Major Mann, the commander of the corps managing the camp, received a report and arrived at the camp a few minutes later, asking Chief Xie to meet him to explain the reasons for the objection. However, Chief Xie refused. Mann saw

that persuasion was ineffective and immediately ordered the commander of the White Russian Corps guarding the camp not to allow anyone to enter or leave the camp until Chief Xie explained his attitude. The Lone Army heard the news and unanimously demanded that visitors be allowed to enter the camp. The commander of the White Russian Corps guarding the camp insisted that he could not disobey the order, which angered the Lone Army, so more than a hundred people rushed into

the courtyard of the barracks of the corps guarding the camp, intending to disarm the White Russian Corps, but it was not carried out. At the same time, the commander of the corps guarding the camp made a phone call to the headquarters of the White Russian Corps, requesting that more corps members be sent to the camp, because the situation was becoming more serious. A small team of the White Russian Corps was immediately dispatched.

Having Arrived at the Camp

Mann had also arrived at the scene and talked with several leaders of the Lone Army. After a long time, he was able to persuade Chief Xie to come out to meet him. After mutual concessions from both sides, the serious situation finally resolved. The small team of the corps that arrived at the camp also left a few minutes later and returned to the headquarters.

Continued to Persist Many People Were Injured

The Fourth Regiment Lone Army Camp on Jiaozhou Road had another conflict with the White Russian Corps at around 9:00 a.m. yesterday, which had not been resolved satisfactorily as of last night. According to a reporter from Pingming News Agency, the conflict was caused by the White Russian Corps setting up barbed wire. It is said that at around 9:00 a.m. yesterday, when the White Russian team was setting up barbed wire at an entrance of the camp, the Lone Army soldiers expressed their dissatisfaction. Both sides

were firm in their attitudes and refused to give in, so they ended up punching each other. The White Russian side also fired tear gas and used fire hydrants to spray the Lone Army soldiers. For a time, the Lone Army barracks became flooded. The police station in charge heard the news and rushed to the scene, and the Italian Defense Forces also dispatched troops to deploy defenses in the Singapore Road area. For a time, the situation was quite tense. The traffic between the Lone Army Camp and the outside world was cut off, and Chief Xie's external telephone was also blocked. The two sides

As a result of the conflict, eight or nine people were injured on the Lone Army side. As of yesterday evening, the dispute was still deadlocked. It is reported that the Municipal Council held negotiations with Chief Xie yesterday regarding this matter, but as of the reporter's deadline, there was no news of any results. According to another source, the conflict was caused by repairing the football field gate, but this could not be confirmed.

### Rice and Grain Evaluation Committee Should Continue to Exist; Evaluation Committee Sends Letter to Authorities Requesting Instructions; Profiteering Brokers to Be Severely Punished by the Court

The Shanghai Rice and Grain Evaluation Committee is organized by thirteen rice industry groups, including the Soybean and Grain Industry, the Miscellaneous Grain and Oil Cake Industry, the Rice Store Industry, the Rice Milling Industry, the Sales Industry, the Rice Market Management Committee, the Shanghai North Rice Merchants United Benefit Association, the Changshu Rice Guild, the South Gang Rice Guild, the Guang Gang Shen Shou Tang, the Han Gang Zhi Cheng Tang, the Zhenjiang Gang Ji Yuan Tang, and the Chaozhou Sugar and Sundries Guild. Chen Ziyi, Zhu Zixiang, Zhang Nianxuan, Qu Zhenhua, Fu Qiangeng, and twenty-one others were publicly elected as ex officio members. It was officially established on July 5th of this year under the guidance of the authorities of the two concessions. More than two months have passed, and eight evaluation committee meetings have been held. The highest price of foreign rice in the market was once evaluated at 60 yuan. However, to this day, the international situation has changed, and the source of foreign rice is not without difficulties. In addition, speculators are using excuses, and the market price of rice and grain is soaring. One call brings a hundred responses. The market price of foreign rice has actually exceeded 70 yuan. The evaluation is like a formality, and the announcement is like a mere statement. Ordinary people are suffering serious threats, and it seems inevitable that some will take risks. The committee feels that its heart is willing but its strength is insufficient, and has already sent letters to the authorities of the two concessions, appealing for instructions on the direction, so as to follow.

Concession Authorities Should Provide Instructions

Yesterday, a certain celebrity in this city told a New Voice News reporter that at a time when the people are panicking about food, the Rice and Grain Evaluation Committee should continue to exist. However, the need to increase the committee's strength cannot be delayed. Therefore, it is hoped that the authorities of the two concessions will provide practical guidance, and send additional members to participate in the deliberations, and order the committee's established policies to be implemented step by step, and provide strong assistance. Otherwise, the entire rice market in Shanghai will be unimaginable.

Zhang and Qu Resign, Unanimously Retained

The Shanghai Rice Store Industry Association has repeatedly insisted that the price limit for foreign rice should not be relaxed, and has also held meetings, with the industry collectively ordering foreign rice to avoid being affected by expensive imports and cheap exports. This is currently in active progress. Zhang Nianxuan and Qu Zhenhua, who participated in the Rice Evaluation Committee, submitted their resignations a few days ago. The Rice Evaluation Committee believes that Zhang and Qu have made many contributions, and has sent a letter to retain them.

The Court Strictly Deals with Profiteering Brokers

Because the price of rice in this city has repeatedly soared, the Public Works Department and rice industry groups jointly established a price limit. However, the general rice merchants only know how to fill their own pockets, ignoring the interests of the public. Although the price limit has been set, they are disobeying in secret. The actual market price is much higher than the price limit. The Public Works Department has prosecuted and dealt with those who violated the order in accordance with the law, and only then did they slightly suppress their arrogance. However, as time passes, they become playful, and such incidents have occurred again. The political department of the Public Works Department sent a monitor, Hua Detective Mao Guoshi, stationed at the rice market. On the morning of the previous day at 10:30, he discovered that a rice broker, Sun Quanguan from Qingpu, was selling a package of No. 2 Saigon rice samples, claiming to have 50 bags of rice. The selling price was 65 yuan per stone. The detective pointed out that the limit stipulated that the maximum price for this type of rice was 59 yuan per stone. Now Sun's selling price actually exceeded the price limit by 6 yuan. He was arrested. Sun wanted to bribe the detective with 40 yuan in legal currency. The detective took him to the Lao Zha Police Station. Yesterday morning, the police station lawyer Fang Fushu sent him to the Special First Court, and Judge Fang, etc., severely punished him in accordance with Article 122 of the Criminal Law and Article 33 of the Violation of Police Regulations and Penalties, in order to warn others.

### Mid-Autumn Festival Settlement Tomorrow, All Industries Pass Safely

All Industry Markets Closed for One Day

September 16th (the 15th day of the eighth lunar month) is the Mid-Autumn Festival. All industries have rushed to settle accounts and have sent people to collect outstanding debts. For those in other ports, they have asked the industry associations for proof and sent people to collect them. This year, due to the blockade of the coastal areas of Zhejiang and Fujian and Vietnam, the cargo transportation of all routes has been stopped, and the actual sales are zero. The prices of goods have fallen, and the entire economy is extremely depressed. Fortunately, all factories, merchants, firms, and companies have tried their best to find ways to survive. The Mid-Autumn Festival settlement this year can generally be barely passed. Today is Sunday, a regular holiday. Tomorrow, the silver and money industry will be closed for one day. Therefore, all industries have completed the collection and settlement of the Mid-Autumn Festival yesterday, Saturday. As for the markets of various industries, such as gold, securities, foreign exchange, cotton, soybeans, grains, etc., they are all closed as usual during the Mid-Autumn Festival.

Banknotes Flying All Over the Street, Robbers Fled in Panic

At about 10:00 a.m. yesterday, at the intersection of Ningbo Road and Sichuan Road, there was a person who was about 20 years old, wearing short clothes, and looked like an old quartermaster of a business firm. He was carrying a shoebox and a receipt book. The box was full of banknotes. It is heard that he was ordered to go to a nearby money house to escort the money. Unexpectedly, as he approached the place, a robber suddenly ambushed on the side of the road. Seeing the person carrying the money, he immediately stepped forward to rob him. Seeing that there was only one robber, and that he was unarmed, the person insisted on not letting go of the shoebox and shouted "Robber!" The two sides fought with each other. The hemp rope on the shoebox broke, causing the banknotes in the box to scatter all over the street. Passersby stopped to watch. Seeing that the situation was not good, the robber abandoned the money and fled from the crowd. Afterwards, Chinese and Western detectives from nearby heard the news and came to collect the scattered banknotes. It is heard that there were no losses.

### Letter

Dear Editor, The news report "Only Son Run Over and Killed by Car" in the September 13th Shen Bao newspaper does not conform to the facts. It is found that Zhu Yunsheng's seven-year-old only son, Caixing, was knocked down and killed by a French Public Bus No. 21, No. 824, on Poplar Road and Baylor Road, entirely due to the fault of driver Ma Canwen, No. 96. The deceased was three feet away from the station when the bus started, and he did not press the horn, which can be verified. The statement that the death was due to the deceased's own carelessness and that the driver was not at fault is clearly intended to evade responsibility. Please make a correction on behalf of the public. Corresponding to the letter, I hope you will check and correct it. Sincerely, Cheng Zhengping, Lawyer, September 14th, to Shen Bao Newspaper.

### The Secret Mark of the China Farmers Bank Two Corner Ticket

The style of the two-corner ticket recently issued by the China Farmers Bank has been seen in this newspaper before. Now, the secret mark of the ticket is written as follows:

On the upper right corner of the front, between the tops of the two trees, there is the character "大" 1. Next to the tree on the left, near the "贰角" border, there is the English letter "T". A few points below that, there are the two letters "LE".

The above secret marks are quite difficult to detect, and are even smaller than the secret marks of the five-cent auxiliary coin. I am sure there are omissions, and I still need the guidance of experts. (Ji He)

### Gold Market Still Stable: Market Reopens on the 19th After the Holiday

Yesterday's spot gold market saw secret dealings and further declines. Observing the recent volatility of the gold market, there exists extremely intense speculation. Most small-scale operators already harbor wariness, while those who usually stir up trouble now reach their point of interest. As for the reasons for today's decline, aside from the initial signs of firmness in the exchange rate market, everything stemmed from changes in public sentiment. Even if there was a desire to rise, it was suppressed by powerful short sellers. Ultimately, because there were too many floating individual investors, their resolve wavered, and many were forced to sell. The lowest price dropped from an opening of $6,100 to $6,085. Fortunately, there was a slight surge in buying before the close, raising it to $6,145. As a result, it closed $25 lower than the previous day. There was no market on Saturday afternoon, and the off-market trend slightly weakened. Trading was still brisk in the morning, with approximately 2,500 taels traded. Gold jewelry prices remained unchanged. Customs gold remained steady. Since next Monday is the Mid-Autumn Festival holiday, and Wednesday is the (September 18th) Incident anniversary, Tuesday will also be closed, resulting in a total of four days of closure. The market will resume as usual on Thursday.

Spot Gold Drops $25

Since the initial opening, the exchange rate market was reported as weak, and the market sentiment was extremely sluggish. Silver houses scrambled to undercut prices and aggressively sold, resulting in a sharp $70 drop. First, a gold firm offered 20 taels to a silver house at $6,100. Subsequently, as sellers continued to emerge, a certain silver house with long positions unloaded, further pushing the price down by more than $10 to a low of $6,085. Fortunately, money exchange businesses and individual investors had good appetites, and there was overnight short covering, so the price gradually stabilized. It did not rise back to $6,135. However, a certain silver house then resumed aggressive selling, with a quantity of approximately 10 taels or more. Although securities firms seized the opportunity to absorb, it was ultimately pushed down again to $6,105. At noon, with the activity of Hong Kong firms, it immediately rose by more than $10. In addition, as the exchange rate market soon softened, buying interest surged. A certain silver house reversed its actions from selling to buying, and money exchange businesses with long positions took the opportunity to raise prices. As a result, the market ultimately closed at the day's high of $6,145, still $25 lower than the previous day. With fluctuations of $60 in half a day, the off-market trend was soft, at $6,125, where some transactions occurred. The selling price of spot gold from cash shops was more than $10 higher than the spot price, while the buying price was $30 lower. The current margin gold price was more than $50 lower than the listed gold price. There were very few new transactions.

Jewelry Gold Returns Slightly

The exchange price of gold jewelry in silver shops was once quoted $10 higher at 9:50 am, suspended at $620, but by noon it returned $10 higher, ultimately remaining at the original price of $630. The price was the same for new colleagues and the buying price was approximately $30 lower.

### British Bills Have No Advisors, Price Drops Another 50 Cents, US Bills Still Hovering

Yesterday, the foreign currency market suddenly softened again. British and American gold pounds each fell by $1 as a result. British gold bills still have no advisors, and the market price fell another 50 cents. American gold bills still did not escape the hovering trend, ultimately continuing to fall by 7 cents. Hong Kong bills frequently declined, retreating to $4.21 in the evening market. Japanese gold bills felt increasingly unsupported, retreating to $1.49 in the evening market. Korean bills had supply exceeding demand, and the market price weakened, retreating to $1.10 in the evening market.

### Food: Rice Prices Near the Holiday Slightly Weaken

After the current silver dollar rice market turned to hovering from the previous trend, yesterday it ultimately became a situation of first stable and then weak. It was said that sellers in the morning still considered maintaining their position without changes. If No. 2 Saigon required $65, No. 2 Siam and Little Twisted $62.50. However, as the Mid-Autumn Festival approached, most speculators and actual sales customers had to engage in closing out positions, resulting in a decline in transactions. Furthermore, the cash situation was not only lacking fresh funds, but also sought to quickly exit, resulting in an imbalance between supply and demand, with most seeking to exit. Moreover, it was reported that rice merchants had a telegram stating that 2,000 tons were being shipped from Burma and Siam, which seemed to suggest a possible overall arrangement in the current market. Therefore, public sentiment and market prices uniformly plummeted by more than $1. As a result, it was slightly less than half a dollar lower than the previous day. Keh Hsien and Keh Yuan continued to arrive from the Yangtze River area, and more could continuously arrive in the future. Therefore, the selling price also saw a slight return of 50 to 70 or 80 cents, it was said. No. 1 Saigon was only $68.50, Quick Twisted $67.50, $67, No. 2 Saigon $64.20, No. 2 Siam $62, Little Twisted $63, $62.60, Tokyo Sharp Tip $58.50, $58, Haiphong Red Tip $58.80, $57, Rice Leuh $54, $53.50.

Although glutinous rice had no arrivals, the outgoing route was tight, and the market price could not be sustained, falling by 50 cents to $1. Open Gold Lieh Teh Yuan $71.2, Chang Dan White Yuan $70.05 to $69, Hong Kong Teh Yuan $71.5, $71, Ordinary $70.05 to $69.

The sources of thick and thin broken keng rice and other national rice, since they were near the holiday, had no arrivals. Off-market secret dealings were rumored to be stable because of this, without success or failure. Party Gang Teh Keng $80, Ordinary $78-79, Wu Chang Su Kun Keng High $78-79, Next to $76-77, Qing Jiao Thin Broken $77, South Port Original Package Early Broken $76.5, $76, Jie Jian $74, $73.5.

Yesterday's new keng tip arrivals included 32 stones of Zhoupu new keng, 34 stones of Taicang Jiading Yang tip, and 16 stones of Jiaoli Du tip. Because they were timely delicacies, their sales were especially good, so their selling prices stood out exceptionally, presenting a firm situation. It is calculated that new keng $72-73, Taicang Jiading, Yang Tip were both $66.5, $66, Du Tip $67.5, $67, (Advertisement) Today is a weekly holiday, tomorrow is the Mid-Autumn Festival, and all rice market businesses will be closed for two days for closing accounts, and will resume normal business on the 17th.

### Japanese Flour Speculation: Actually Exits the Pass at $16; There is Talk of Increasing Prices at Chinese Factories

Yesterday, the No. 2 flour factory price remained at the original price of $15.50. Spot flour was quite tight. With the Mid-Autumn Festival closing the border, the street's needs were very good. Because the production of each factory was limited, they were unable to fully supply. The market was exceptionally brisk in secret. There were rumors that the factory price would increase after the holiday, which attracted general attention. Because the Japanese factory's futures flour had already risen to over $16, which was higher than the factory price. But in fact, it was all being aggressively raised by speculators and did not belong to the normal track. It was all speculators stirring up trouble. Because Phoenix brand futures flour had become a speculative chip, the market was being pursued by both long and short parties. The volume of transactions for October reached as many as 80,000 bags. The volume of transactions for September was also 10,000 bags. The opening price for September was from $15.45 to $15.50, which was 17 cents higher than the previous day. The opening price for October was $15.80, rising to $16.08, which was 28 cents higher than the previous day. Yuh Weng Yuan Cannon Passenger prices still required $17. Chinese factories were still unwilling to sell. Foreign flour was $17.40 to $17.50 and still needed to be tightly called, but no formal transactions were heard.

### New Chongming Wheat Arrives: Price Opens at $25

In recent days, the wheat market situation has been such that, because the issuance of transport permits has been difficult, goods arriving from the mainland have been scarce. Chinese factories have had difficulty buying, and Japanese factories have suppressed prices to buy. The difference in prices has often been more than $3. Therefore, most cargo owners have wanted to defend and wait for opportunities, unwilling to sell painfully. Apart from sending to factories for pricing, there has been no formal market. However, it was heard that yesterday nearly 1,000 packages of new Chongming wheat suddenly arrived, which were quite welcomed by the mainland gang. The mainland gang reportedly took away a load at a price of $25. The Japanese factory also took away 500 packages at a price of only $21. The market situation followed the flour market and became tight.

### Securities: Domestic Debt Remains Firm

Securities trading was only conducted for half a day yesterday. Because today is Sunday and tomorrow is a two-day holiday for the Mid-Autumn Festival, market sentiment was relatively stable. Market prices saw both rises and falls. On one hand, floating long positions were slightly unloaded due to economic reasons. On the other hand, with ample funds, they seized the opportunity to absorb. Market prices therefore rose and fell erratically, but the trend remained very strong. There were more changes during the two-day holiday, and public sentiment was slightly uncertain. Yesterday morning's half-day trading saw quite enthusiastic buying of Lian Yi Heng Fu and scattered purchases. Shun Chang Tong Kang and Hu He Ji saw some selling, with different choices made. Market prices therefore saw both high and low prices. As a result, rises outnumbered falls, but by a very small amount. The volume of transactions was approximately $7.1 million. A brief table is listed below.

Category Highest Lowest Closing Compared to Previous Day

Stock Trading, 500 shares of Chinese Business Electric Shares were traded at a price of $5.90.

London, September 13th (Friday) Telegram, Today's listings for Chinese foreign debt and Far Eastern British company stocks were all calm. Market conditions generally remained unchanged.

### Ample Yarn and Flower Chips: Yarn Prices Want to Rise but are Hindered

The yarn market was ordinary. The range of ups and downs became increasingly narrow, with high and low prices only around $10. In fact, current sales were smooth, but the environment was poor. In addition, inventory gradually increased. Therefore, although long-term intentions were strong, there were enough chips to distribute, and there was nothing that could be done. However, some were still considering buying, because the exchange rate was still expected to shrink. However, in terms of itself, the ability to rise was particularly weak. Therefore, some made a profit when October was rising, and the price reached $988.

The morning opening of spot yarn saw relatively mild sentiment. Because there were no major changes in various materials. However, most people were optimistic. 20-count Double Horse was uniformly quoted at $985. The opening price was $983. It was then heard that the opening of exchange bills was long, and gold greatly declined. Selling was slightly stronger, falling to $975. It hovered at this price for a long time. Finally, the market said that starting Monday, there would be a three-day closure for the Mid-Autumn Festival and the September 18th Incident. Normal business would resume on the 19th. In order to avoid risks, most closed out their positions for the holiday. Therefore, the market situation went from soft to firm, returning to $979 at the close. The statistics for transactions in half a day totaled 2,155 bales. The market for 20-count Double Horse did not have much difference from the previous price. The amounts bought by the various groups are listed separately below.

Ningbo 25 Mainland 20 Colleagues 1,790 Hong Kong 280 Jiangxi 30 Wenzhou 20 Total 2,155

### Cotton Market: Let's See After the Holiday

The current cotton situation still lacks exciting developments to describe. Factory appetites are particularly dull. This is because the yarn market cannot prosper. Therefore, public sentiment is mediocre. As for new cotton, although the harvest year is prosperous, it is futile if it cannot be transported out of the country. A total of 10 bales of fire machines were priced at $154, it was said.

Another message: Foreign cotton market prices, New York cotton market, market conditions were firm, because there was a lack of sellers. Later, there was some reactionary buying. As a result, the closing situation was exceptionally stable, rising one pound. The Indian market situation was also particularly calm, along with a prediction of rising half a rupee.

Shanghai's foreign cotton trading was silent all day long. Because yarn prices failed to rally, all parties temporarily had no thought of transacting and planned to quietly pass the Mid-Autumn Festival before making further calculations. The factory's intention to purchase has also been very weak recently.

### Oil Market: Edible Oil Sees Another Monopoly, Cargo Owners Sell Upwards, Prices Rise Again

Yesterday, the oil market saw another surge, resulting from continuous movement in sales venues and the high-spirited desires of general speculation, leading to intense monopolistic tactics. Cargo owners' intention to sell was also firm, single-mindedly holding onto good prices. Therefore, market conditions repeatedly rose. The total market saw 20 barrels of Dalian soybean oil open, see the market price column, 30 barrels of Qingdao soybean oil, 50 pieces of Jiaozhou soybean oil, 350 dan of Da You Yu Factory soybean oil, 30 barrels of Pudong Factory soybean oil, 120 pieces of Jiaozhou raw oil, 350 pieces were ordered for late September delivery at a price of $64.50 to $65.75, 150 pieces were ordered for early October delivery at a price of $65.50 to $66.50, 750 pieces were ordered for late October delivery at a price of $66, 130 pieces of Yantai raw oil at a price of $65, 130 barrels of Qingdao raw oil at a price of $91.50 to $92.50, 50 barrels were ordered for late October delivery at a price of $93, also 1,000 tins in cans at a price of $92.50. According to the announcement from the miscellaneous grain oilcake market, the 16th and 18th of this month will be closed as usual.

### Sugar Market: Edible Sugar Transport and Sale to the Mainland is Obstructed

Yesterday, the sugar market was said to be because the transport permits for transporting to the mainland were controlled by a certain party and not issued, making it difficult to transport and sell temporarily. Although there were only slightly more than 1,000 bags of imported sugar in Shanghai, the above-mentioned relationship made it difficult to improve temporarily. The association's planned price drop saw a return to looseness. Spot 24 Crude White, the store still had $78, new goods from foreign stores $78, Small Hexagon, Transit goods $62.80, Unchanged, Dutch Cotton White KD Mark, $73.7, Small Triangle, Dutch Red Small $1, Mark $62, Miscellaneous Mark $61, Taikoo Car White also Small $1 to several corners, B Mark $75.5, DY Mark $72.9, HX Mark $72.7 to 5, National sugar has also not been opened.

### Piece Goods: Cloth Sales Uniquely Strong in South China

National Cloth Yesterday's market was dark and dull. There were few transactions from stocking households. Customer sales were uniquely strong in South China. However, wholesale shipments were not smooth. The loading of goods in the Soviet-Chekiang guerrilla area was still subject to strict restrictions. The Shanghai market inventory greatly increased. Cloth factories also had a general trend of reducing work. Yesterday's cloth prices were flat. A portion of each piece fell by 10 to 25 cents. Factory direct sales still had secret dealings. Guangdong-Hong Kong agents had several hundred pieces of colored cloth and colored twill. Zhejiang-Fujian agents had more than two hundred pieces of coarse cloth and colored twill. Colleagues on the street transacted in more than six hundred pieces of grey cloth, velvet cloth, coarse cloth, and printed cloth. Agents in foreign Siam and Singapore had several thousand pieces of bleached cloth.

Eastern Cloth The market atmosphere was flat and tired, and transactions were very light. Twelve-pound Dragon Head fine cloth opened in the morning at $32.35, rising to $32.65, but ultimately, due to sluggish actual sales, it returned to a decline. The closing price of the after-market was around $32.5. Four Gentlemen Serge was 91.5 cents per yard.

Exports Yesterday, there were 170 pieces of piece goods transported to Siam, and another 100 pieces transported to Yantai.

### Lined Overcoat Fabric: Many Goods, Low Prices

Lined overcoat fabrics, riding breeches, camelskins, and cashmere are the two most popular types. Currently, with the Mid-Autumn Festival approaching and the weather turning cooler, actual sales are timely. Most shops specializing in lined overcoats are actively stocking up, resulting in quite smooth market sales recently. But observing the selling prices, various brands have seen price declines, because in the previous month, when sales were not strong, the atmosphere was tense. There had been early buying and selling. Each store had considerable inventory, and because there were eager orders from factories, spot goods were woven and filled. In addition, Yih Ho Factory first reported price declines for various goods, which caused many goods to follow cheaper, resulting in an oversupply and a decline in market conditions. Yesterday, Zhang Hua riding breeches were quoted at $23-24, Yih Ho $25-26, Saigon 1005 old brand at $38. Camelskin selling prices were $1.5 higher than riding breeches. Yongxing goods were only sold at $22 per yard.

### Financial Review and Commentary

— Sheng Kaiqiong

— September 14th —

The True Meaning of Frugality and National Salvation Savings

The National Frugality and National Salvation Savings Movement Committee and the National Frugality and Diligence Committee jointly initiated the "Frugality and National Salvation Savings Corps," which held its inaugural meeting in Chongqing on the 6th. The Supreme Commander of China was appointed as the Honorary Leader, and Vice President Kong, concurrently Minister of Finance, served as the General Leader. To actively promote the movement for quick results, General Leader Kong telegraphed all provincial governors and mayors on the 9th, requesting that savings corps be established by September 15th. During the period from September 18th to Double Ten Day, actively launch the Frugality and National Salvation Savings Movement, with a mandatory goal of each citizen saving a minimum of one to five yuan per month.

The promotion of frugality and savings in China is based on the first principle of the wartime economic construction's three principles: "To engage in the accumulation of capital for production and the revitalization of industry with extreme frugality and diligence." Therefore, on November 29, 1938, the National Government promulgated the eleven articles of the Regulations on Frugality and National Salvation Savings. On September 12, 1939, the Ministry of Finance announced the twelve articles of the Regulations on Frugality and National Salvation Savings Bonds. In the same year, on December 14, the Ministry of Finance also announced the eight chapters, totaling twenty-one articles, of the Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Regulations on Frugality and National Salvation Savings Bonds. The issuing agencies, subscription methods, and fund utilization of savings bonds are all detailed in the aforementioned three regulations. This article briefly discusses its origin and two points regarding the economic impact of the war.

Savings bonds originated in Britain. During the First European War, they became wartime savings bonds, which were the best way to promote small savings. At that time, they were very effective in Britain, absorbing an amount of 300 to 400 million pounds, which was extremely effective in strengthening the wartime economy and stabilizing the post-war economy. After the outbreak of this European war, the government immediately issued savings bonds, and the total amount reached more than 100 million pounds within thirteen weeks. Therefore, the Chinese government also followed suit after one year of the War of Resistance.

As for the key to the war economy, its utilization and the theories of current economists are very different. Generally, it is believed that the government's financial needs increase during wartime, and the amount of funds in society also increases. Therefore, savings are used to absorb idle funds in society, reduce the amount of currency in circulation, and use savings funds in the form of public bonds. According to this method, such cycles are repeated to increase financial resources and regulate currency. However, if this method is used to strengthen the war economy and stabilize the post-war economy, there is a significant phenomenon: all the funds in society become national public debt, which is a kind of consumer wealth, not a kind of accumulated productive capital. Therefore, the current use of savings bond funds should absolutely avoid the above-mentioned method, and regard investment in economic construction as the guideline for fund utilization. Increased revenue from state-owned enterprises and increased tax revenue should be sought in the development of wealth and the revitalization of industry. The goal of seeking increased financial resources is the same, and the method of using savings to absorb funds and regulate currency is also the same, but the technology adopted to achieve increased financial resources is completely different.

In short, the promotion of frugality and national salvation savings is indeed a financial measure that makes extremely valuable contributions to China's finance during this era of resistance and national construction. On the individual level, it can cultivate a national spirit of frugality, eliminate waste, and prepare for improvements in personal and family life. On the national level, it can accumulate construction funds, transform consumer wealth into productive wealth, and enable the rapid completion of national economic construction, thereby strengthening the power of the war economy. Since the beginning of China's War of Resistance, the author has deeply felt that the mobilization of material and financial resources has not yet reached the goal of matching and adapting to military and political needs, and the construction of the wartime economy requires the joint efforts of every Chinese citizen.

Review of Men's Health Issues After Marriage

…What life seeks, no illness is a god!

…Physical weakness after marriage is the most tragic of sufferings!

Because many classmates, friends, and relatives, neighbors, they were young, we once played together, their bodies felt good, but after marriage, in a short time, most have been declining state, not specific ambition depressed, no longer have the aggressive past, and several people even died from illness. Old friends wither, it really makes me sad! Because I am studying medicine, which further aroused my motivation to review the health problems of men after marriage.

Does married life have any impact on health? The answer to this question can be described as "different opinions." But summing up, it is nothing more than two sides, positive and negative. Some people say that marriage is detrimental to health. If a man does not marry and always maintains his virginity, he can enjoy longevity. However, those who refute him say: In fact, only see the life of late-married men is shorter than that of married men. Although single monks may enjoy longevity, but in fact can an adult man not marry? Therefore, some people say that marriage is helpful to health, because the sexes are the natural instinct, innate and timely to show its effect. If this effect is too suppressed, physiological barriers will occur. The most common phenomenon in late-married men often has Hysteria, neurasthenia and other symptoms, according to medical scientist (Jamsu) James Tuo said: "A man over the age of twenty-eight and not married, more or less always a bit of mental illness." At first we didn't believe it, but after careful observation of the facts, we knew it was true. We know more in biological studies that some animals die because they cannot find a mate. So marriage is indeed a necessary event that we cannot avoid in life. As long as the man is pure-hearted and abstemious before marriage, and keeps his virginity, and can keep the way of hygiene in married life after marriage, then the love between husband and wife can last forever, spend their sweet life forever, give birth to smart children, and organize a happy family. In this way, not only can they improve their health, but also enrich the happiness of their lives. It is truly the so-called "more blessings, more longevity, more sons." But if a young man commits self-masturbation or post-marital debauchery, he will definitely explode spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, impotence, energy dissipation, neurasthenia and other symptoms. In this way, not only will he be sick and short-lived, shortening their natural life, but also must be unable to coordinate in married life, and will be hated by his wife, and stage various tragedies in the family! When it comes to this point, the problem is even more serious and complex. The only remedy, according to world-famous doctors and my experience, is to take the gonadotropin preparation "Reproductive Element", which is most effective for the symptoms. Because this agent is replicated by scientific methods from the gonadotropin extracted from the majestic animal body, so the quality is pure, the medicinal properties are royal, and the tonic power is active, which is really unmatched by other glandular preparations. After taking it, it can produce sperm and tonify the kidney, strengthen the brain and activate blood circulation, and nourish nerves in one day and night. If it can be taken continuously and consistently, it will definitely be able to completely cure the above symptoms in a short period of time. However, those with spermatorrhea must also take "Ximituo's Sperm-Consolidating Tablets" to consolidate the sperm pass and stop leakage, then the effect will be faster!

Fitness and Beauty

### The Value of Breasts in Female Fitness and Beauty

— American Medical Doctor Yao Chongpei

Not to say a word to increase the ambition of others and destroy their own prestige, Western women are indeed much more healthy and beautiful than our Chinese women. Not only do they have straight chests and high breasts in their girlhood, but also large hips. Walking on the road, they have a magnificent, arrogant, and arrogant spirit. Even a few old women, although their hair is white, their pair of breasts are still so high, and have not萎　withered. Therefore, the children they give birth to are also particularly intelligent and agile, and the physique of the nation is also particularly strong.

According to the research results of world-renowned beauty experts, physiologists, and gynecological experts, Kantlin and Tang Posheng, etc., it is believed that the higher and more elastic the breasts of women are, not only in terms of beauty, can they form the most mysterious curve with the hips and waist. Make every man look at it and have a good feeling. At the same time, due to the soundness of their own ovarian function, the exuberance of metabolism, their temperament is uninhibited and gentle, their muscles are crystal clear and white, and they think more　sensitively and thoroughly. Even when faced with difficult problems, they can deal with them analytically and will not feel difficult to cope with. In addition, due to the full circulation of blood, a peach blossom-like smile appears on their faces. Even if they do not apply makeup, they are also very beautiful. Although age increases, youth remains. Sexual life is infinitely sweet, and they organize healthy and lively children. Such women, their contribution to the country and the family is really great! However, in the past, if the breasts withered　and the hips were thin due to chest binding, self-abuse, irregular menstruation, and leucorrhea, they not only have been sick in their girlhood, with no beautiful and moving posture at all. And once they get married, they also increase the hatred of their husbands due to lack of sexual interest and the above-mentioned defects, and even abandon them! The only remedy is to take the ovarian preparation for women "Reproductive Element" to nourish menstruation, so that the ovarian function is sound, and the metabolism is also vigorous. The above symptoms can not only be completely cured, but also make the breasts high and the cheeks rosy, and increase health and beauty.

### Nocturnal Emission and Self-abuse are the Demons of Youth

— Sexually Transmitted Disease Specialist Zhan Nianhui

This may be the abnormal pathology of society! During this extraordinary period of saving the country, the lights are still red and the wine is green on this isolated island, filled with erotic and lewd nets. A general young people just in the development, in this rich and seductive environment, not to mention his heart is also looking forward to all the secrets between the sexes, ready to try to see what a result, but they on the one hand because of the economic and venereal disease terrible, afraid to openly go to prostitution, but on the one hand can not get rid of the fascination of peach, so had to ask the next best thing, then began to commit self-abuse,

After a young man commits self-abuse, even if his thoughts are rich, his memory is strong, and his physical strength is solid, he will unknowingly degenerate at this time. If he suffers from spermatorrhea and sperm leakage due to self-indulgence, at this time, not only will your developmental function stagnate and become incomplete, with a yellow face and thin muscles, and premature aging, it is really the so-called "little old man"! This kind of "little old man's" learning and career are because of the lack of brainpower and physical strength, which makes him accomplish nothing. And because of kidney deficiency and incompetence, and the reason for the dissipation of energy, but also to destroy the happiness in his future married life! However, how can his wife waste her youth for a long time? Therefore, the staging of various tragedies in the family is also a common thing!

Regarding the treatment of nocturnal emission, although there are many advertisements on the market today, but the most effective, according to world-famous doctors and my many years of experience, is to take "Ximituo's Sperm-Consolidating Tablets", because this agent can not only consolidate the sperm pass, but also calm the nerves, so that young people with neurasthenia, to get sleep, so the dreams are reduced, the heart is disturbed all gone, nocturnal emission can be cured, but because the nocturnal emission has caused the above-mentioned symptoms, should also take the gonadotropin preparation "Reproductive Element", to nourish the brain and kidney, increase sperm and blood, and nourish the nerves, if you can continue to take, will be able to fully restore health in the short term.

New and Old Leukorrhea Can Be Cured in a Short Period

If You Don't Believe, Come for a Consultation, the Fact Will Be Solid Proof!

After seeing this title, patients with shallow knowledge who have never seen the latest scientific weapons may have many doubts, thinking that this doctor is boasting. But in the eyes of those who have been baptized by the latest science or who have been treated by me, they naturally feel that my title is not an exaggeration at all. Because the world now is not the 19th century, look: everything, no matter what you eat, use, or walk on, is progressing with the times. So, can't the leukorrhea that people in the 19th century thought was difficult to treat completely be controlled? The so-called "it depends on the person," the focus is that you can't concentrate on research, that's true. As for my methods and medical equipment for treating new and old leukorrhea, I can frankly tell you some here: Because treating leukorrhea has been my full-time job for seventeen years. I usually don't rely on false names to live in comfort. I still do everything myself and study diligently, never relying on assistant doctors. I am even more meticulous and cautious in prescribing medicine and performing surgery, and I am loyal and honest. As for therapeutic equipment, as long as it is truly effective, I will find a way to purchase it, no matter how expensive it is. Roughly speaking, there are ureteroscopes, cystoscopes, ultra-magnifying microscopes, short and long wave diathermy machines, coolers, etc. The most helpful for me in treating turbidity is the German Lulin flat-flow diathermy machine. The bactericidal power of this machine can be said to be unparalleled in the world, so no matter whether it is new or old leukorrhea, once treated with this machine, supplemented by other operations and medicines, it is really foolproof. I guarantee that it can be completely cured in two weeks for the quick ones and five weeks for the slow ones. Curing is not strange, what is strange is that it will never recur.

### Bertrand Russell's Theory of Academic Freedom

British mathematician and philosopher Dr. Bertrand Russell recently served as a lecturer at the University of California in the United States. In May of this year, the New York Supreme Court ruled that Russell was not allowed to teach mathematics, philosophy, and science at the City University of New York because he advocated free love. This case caused a great uproar in American education circles for a time, and the details of the case have been translated and published in this newspaper. This article is Professor Russell's reply, originally published in Harper's Magazine, and is now translated as follows:

In the past hundred years, the profession of teaching has changed from instructing a few people in the pursuit of academic excellence to a public service related to the majority of people. From ancient times to the present, this profession has had a glorious and great history; but modern teachers, if inspired by the ideals of their predecessors, will deeply feel that teaching people with their ideals is not their task, and that their task is precisely to instill the beliefs and prejudices that their employers consider useful. In the past, a teacher had to possess great wisdom, and his every word and deed were respected. In ancient times, teaching was not an organized profession, and no one interfered with their teaching. Of course, there were also those who were punished for their heretical doctrines. Socrates was sentenced to death, and Plato was imprisoned, but such accidents did not hinder the spread of their doctrines. Anyone who has a pure and subtle feeling for teachers wants to pass on his books, not his body, to future generations, to be immortal. Intellectually unique insights are the main conditions for completing the teacher's task, and it is his duty to create public opinion with knowledge and reason as much as possible. In ancient times, teachers could perform this task without interference, except for occasional ineffective interventions by tyrants or rioters. In the Middle Ages, teaching became the privilege of the Church, and as a result, there was little progress in knowledge or society. By the time of the Renaissance, society universally respected learning and restored greater freedom to teachers. Throughout history, most universities and other institutions of learning have been in the hands of dogmatists, and as a result, most of the excellent literary works have been written by scholars who are not related to educational institutions. Especially in England, until the nineteenth century, except for Newton, very few first-class scholars were related to universities. But the social system at that time rarely interfered with their work.

In the more highly organized modern world, we have a new problem. So-called "education" is generally granted to individuals by the state, and sometimes by the church. Teachers therefore, in most cases, become public servants and must be responsible for educating children for those who are uneducated and for those who have no teaching experience. Their only purpose in running education is propaganda. In such circumstances, it is difficult for teachers to fulfill their most suitable responsibilities.

State education is obviously necessary, but it also obviously contains some dangers. The kind of malpractices we fear have been fully manifested in Germany and the Soviet Union. The youth of these two countries have become stubborn and ignorant of things outside their own country. Although this situation is extremely bad, if it can be as universal and international as the Catholicism of the Middle Ages, its harm may not be so great. But the entire theory of international culture is opposed by modern dictators, who have one kind of belief in Germany, another in Italy, one in the Soviet Union, and yet another in Japan. In these countries, each country pays special attention to educating young people, in the heat of nationalism, as a result, the people of one country have no common ground with the people of other countries, and there is no common awareness of civilization to eliminate mutual killing.

In democratic countries, these kinds of malpractices are not so serious, but there are still equally serious dangers in education. This danger can only be avoided by those who believe in freedom of thought, carefully preventing teachers from being restricted in their knowledge. I believe that teaching a certain indisputable knowledge is the least important item in a teacher's responsibility. Naturally, this is the basis for other knowledge, and it is of great use to our mechanical civilization. In modern society, there should be sufficient technical talents to preserve the machinery on which our material happiness depends. But it is also extremely inconvenient if a large part of the population cannot read or write. Therefore, I am very much in favor of implementing universal compulsory education. But governments know very well that in the process of education, it is easy to instill beliefs and opinions that are beneficial or unfavorable to the authorities in certain teaching materials with different viewpoints. The responsibility for the defense of civilized countries lies in the hands of teachers, no less than in the army. Apart from totalitarian countries, national defense is necessary, and there is nothing wrong with the education carried out for this purpose. What can be criticized is only that the country uses a system of illiteracy and appeals to unreasonable enthusiasm to defend itself.

This method is not necessary for any country worth defending. However, those who have no direct knowledge of education have a natural tendency to adopt this method. Many people believe that the uniformity of public opinion and the limitation of freedom can make the country stronger. Since 1700, although victory in every major war has mostly belonged to the more democratic countries, we have repeatedly heard opinions that democracy makes a country weak and incompetent in war. But judging from past facts, there have been more people who advocate narrow-minded ideological unity who have caused the demise of the country than those who advocate freedom of thought. Although the world's dogmatists also know this, they believe that if two different opinions are given the opportunity to express themselves freely, it is enough to lead people astray. This view is enough to cause two kinds of misfortune: either one faction of dogmatists conquers the world and prohibits all new ideas, or another faction of dogmatists conquers other regions and propagates hatred creeds to meet each other with arms, similar to the former's crime, which occurred in the Middle Ages, similar to the latter's crime, which was seen in the era of religious wars, and again in modern times. The former makes civilization stagnate, and the latter makes civilization face the danger of being completely destroyed. In order to prevent these two, teachers should fulfill the task of being the main defenders of civilization. (To be continued)

### The Great Fire of London in the Seventeenth Century

— L

These days, the German air force has been bombing London continuously. The bombs dropped are measured in tons. Apart from the loss of life, civilian houses and official residences have been turned into ruins, and prosperous downtowns have become rubble fields. The two words "hellfire" can really summarize everything. From a historical point of view, this catastrophe of loss of life and property is indeed unprecedented. However, in terms of disaster, London also experienced the greatest fire in history 274 years ago, which burned continuously for three days and three nights, and the embers did not extinguish for seven days. Most of the essence of the entire city was turned into scorched earth, covering an area of 450 acres, with 200,000 people homeless, and a total loss of about 7,335,000 pounds. What is strange is that only eight people lost their lives. Moreover, misfortunes never come singly. In the year before this great fire, London also experienced a great plague. Between summer and autumn, the plague spread in the city, and deaths followed one after another. The citizens fled to the countryside to avoid the plague. The scenes of cars and horses connecting on the way were no less than today's air raid prevention and evacuation of residents in the city. That great plague, from June to December, in just six months, killed more than 68,500 people, which is not shocking to hear. Fortunately, the British used their unyielding spirit to deal with these extraordinary disasters, and finally built a brand-new "Greater London" from the ruined walls, broken walls, scorched wood, and ruins. The following record of the Great Fire is mostly based on the diaries of the naval minister at the time, Pepys, and the writer John Evelyn.

The London plague in 1665, from the winter of the previous year to the spring of this year, did not see a drop of rain, creating an unprecedented drought. After King Charles II of England returned to England, the Restoration had been going on for five years. Although the political facilities had been changed, the narrow streets of London and the crowded habits were still the same as before. Moreover, the city's drinking water supply was very unclean, and the water source was not smooth, which was mostly the reason for the spread of the plague. On June 10, the plague was first seen, and in less than half a month, it was everywhere. In addition to the shock, the residents had no choice but to escape. For a time, on the road to the countryside, men, women, old and young, carried boxes and cages, and cars and horses followed. Within ten days, the lively city became a dead city. Except for a few enthusiastic priests and doctors, all officials, merchants, and scholars all fled far away. In the streets, besides the sanitation team and the burial team, there was nothing else to see. Occasionally, someone walked on the street, also bowing their heads and walking quickly, without saying a word. Almost everyone had nothing to say to each other except "the great and praiseworthy God." The novelist Defoe, the author of Robinson Crusoe, wrote the book "A Journal of the Plague Year" to record the terrible scenes he witnessed at the time, which has been recited by the world. The great poet Milton avoided the plague in the countryside that year and completed his immortal masterpiece "Paradise Lost." The plague subsided slightly by the end of the year, but a wave had not subsided, and another wave rose again. In less than a year, London suffered the greatest fire in history.

The year 1666, which was called the "Year of Miracles", can be said to be the worst year. The British were using troops against the Dutch, and the treasury was being used like flowing water. On the one hand, London suffered unprecedented fire losses, and King Louis XIV of France also allied with the Dutch in that year and declared war on England. The fire broke out at 3:00 AM on Sunday, September 2. At first, the East City reported a fire alarm. After a while of disturbance, everyone thought it was nothing. A group of people who "watched the fire from the other side" went back to sleep when they saw no new developments. However, in the morning, the situation changed drastically. The fire spread in all directions, and many houses near London Bridge were also affected. At this time, the weather was dry and hot, and the east wind was blowing, as if in a fire pit. The houses near the Thames River soon caught fire. Many pigeons raised by people were flying around the windows and balconies, circling several times, with no branches to perch on, and were finally burned and fell to the ground and died.

In the midst of the strong wind and raging fire, no one could think of a way to put it out. Since the drought and plague, the buildings in London have been unusually dry, and once a fire starts, it spreads. Everyone stared blankly at the flames spreading everywhere, at a loss. The busy naval minister (i.e., Pepys, who recorded the Great Fire) entered the palace to inform the emperor and asked him to order that all the burning house walls be destroyed and dragged down, so that the flames would not spread. The King of England approved the request and asked him to cooperate with the Mayor of London to handle the matter. The naval minister met the Mayor of London on the street, only to see him as if drunk and dreaming, shouting in his mouth: "Oh my God, what should I do!" But he worried that in this panic and chaos, the common people would not obey his orders. Later, apart from demolishing houses, there was still no other way to do it.

Pepys drove a small boat on the Thames River to observe the fire. After a while, the King of England and the Duke of York also came upstream in flower boats. They ordered the shore to quickly push down the house walls to block the fire. However, the walls fell slowly and the flames spread quickly, and it was still of no avail. The Thames River was illuminated like daytime, and barges and small boats were everywhere, carrying the goods rescued from the fire. The residents' furniture and daily necessities were rarely rescued on board. There were only two small lyres in one boat, and he had nothing else. Because at that time, citizens loved this instrument very much, and in the panic, they did not take important things instead.

The weather in September was still very hot. In the evening, a red light set off the sunset, which was the color of rouge, making people feel even more hot and terrible. Fire stars and sparks were flying everywhere in the sky. From a burning house, several fireball-like things rose into the air, flew past five or six storefronts, and landed on another house that had not caught fire, and this house was immediately set on fire. In some dilapidated alleys, most of the houses had thatched roofs and wooden walls, and once they caught fire, they could not be salvaged. Moreover, many warehouses near the river bank were stocked with asphalt, tar, and oil and wine, and the fire spared nothing. That night, a huge smoke and fire, like a fire snake several feet thick, went straight to the church district, and famous buildings such as St. Paul's Cathedral suffered the disaster of the Great Fire.

Evelyn's diary is a valuable historical material for recording the Great Fire of London, and the description of the situation at that time is quite faithful. He watched the fire from the shore on Sunday afternoon; on Monday, he returned to the original place to see the fire in the southern half of the city. When the flames reached the church district, he was also there to watch. St. Paul's Cathedral was under renovation at this time, and wooden platforms for workers to work were set up around it, and the flames burned as soon as they arrived. At that time, there was a sound of explosions and crackling in the fire, and women and children screamed in panic; mixed with the sound of houses, spires, and chapels collapsing, it was like a tsunami of overturning mountains and seas. Because the fire was too strong, the air suffocated, and the temperature was so high that everyone had no way to walk into the fire, and could only stand in place and let it burn naturally. In an area two miles long and half a mile wide, the raging fire became a huge furnace. Smoke and nitric acid rose to the sky, extending to fifty miles away.

On Tuesday, September 4, the fire spread to Fleet Street, Old Bailey, Warwick Lane, etc. The bricks and stones of St. Paul's Cathedral flew around, as if throwing hand grenades. The metal, lead, and tin in the church building were melted by the fire and flowed on the ground like a river. The sidewalk flagstones in front of the door were burned red, and people and horses dared not trample on them. The ruined walls of the corners of the houses fell down from mid-air, and the charred wood and rubble completely blocked the road traffic. The court was also quite chaotic at this time. King Charles II of England and his brother took the lead and personally directed everything. Officials supervised the common people on every street, doing the work of knocking down walls and overturning houses.

On the 5th, the wind subsided slightly, and the large flames were not as rampant as in the previous two days. West of the law school and north of Smithfield, the flames did not reach and were fortunately preserved intact. This day was Wednesday, and after burning for three days and three nights, the fire gradually subsided. Pepys said: "Since Sunday, it has been very strange. It seems that the days are very long, because the sleep time has been very short for several days in a row, and I have seen all kinds of different scenes. It seems that more than a week has passed, and I have forgotten what day of the week it is."

While many people were watching the fire on the river bank and on the highlands south of the Thames River, the open space north of the river was filled with many homeless men, women, old and young. There were as many as 200,000 people displaced along the way from Islington to Highgate. There were all kinds of different classes and people. Everyone lay on the roadside, waiting to be fed, a picture of wailing, the scene was very sad, but they did not reach out to ask for help. The King of England, the nobles, and the church all voluntarily took out money to do relief work for the victims. All the poorest people received financial relief, but the relief work was very difficult, especially because food was difficult to obtain. All the usual sources were blocked. Later, the official office announced that farmers in the four villages should bring as much food to the city as possible. The official office also provided various conveniences for the victims who wanted to go to neighboring cities or villages. The country people, after hearing about the fire in the city, also came to "visit" from afar, regardless of the distance. During this fire, many books and documents were destroyed. Some books and papers rose high in the sky and even floated as far as Windsor. The black smoke rose, and it lasted for a long time. During the days of the Great Fire, it even covered the autumn sun, and it was dark and dull. People who came from afar mostly walked in the shadows.

The nobles seemed to be very cold to the King of England. According to Pepys, they did not come to the city to help the King of England or to express their condolences to him. The monument erected to commemorate the Great Fire has a Latin record that says that as a result of this fire, 89 churches, city gates, meeting halls, public places, hospitals, schools, libraries, and countless official buildings were destroyed. 13,200 civilian houses were destroyed in the fire, and 400 streets were destroyed. The government also suffered a lot of losses. In 1665 last year, because of the plague, people fled, and tax revenue was sharply reduced. This time, because of the fire, the people's financial resources were greatly weakened, and many people were impoverished. Where could they get money to pay taxes?

There was originally a line on the monument saying that the fire was caused by the rebellion and resentment of the Catholics. Later, the City Reconstruction Committee saw that this line was indecent and cancelled it. Who started the fire was not clear at the time. Many people were caught, interrogated, and investigated, but there was no clue. Later, a French silversmith suddenly came and claimed to be the arsonist. The authorities did not investigate deeply, believed it to be true, and hanged him. Many people said that this was a disgrace to the official office. Afterwards, the authorities cast a commemorative medal, in the middle was the eye of God, and below were two comets, one representing the plague and the other representing the fire. There were also images of people and horses and the dead. The words above read; "He punished."

After the Great Fire, the city of London soon prepared for reconstruction work. All buildings were replaced with bricks and tiles instead of wood, and streets and water sources were greatly reformed. St. Paul's Cathedral was also rebuilt by famous artists, and the city of London became brilliant and gradually became the world's largest city.

### Memorial Archways

All loyal officials, righteous people, filial sons, filial daughters, virtuous women, and chaste women have the ceremonies of commendation, so as to value fame and integrity and maintain customs. For the commendation, if the matter is important and the traces are strange and difficult, then the archway is built by the government; if it is ordinary, then the archway is built by itself; however, there is no fixed place for building the archway, each is based on the gentry and people of the place, considering its suitability only, either in the open space outside the city, or in the streets inside the city. According to the Song and Ming dynasties, the most archways were built, and it is common to see those that stand across the streets, all titled "Song Officer" or "Ming Woman," and the newly built ones are rarely seen. Among them, many of the stones are dark in color, cracked and about to fall, and the houses below that lean on the foot of the archway are mostly small, and the cracked stones are getting worse day by day. If there is an accident, those who live below will all become powder. Yesterday, I heard that a memorial archway for chastity in Bianyi Street, Yangzhou, fell down, crushing one person to death, and his arm bones were all broken, which was unspeakable! This matter can serve as a warning. I have also seen that the most memorial archways for chastity are erected in the city of Shaoxing Prefecture. The number inside the city cannot be counted in detail; and the most proper ones are in the area outside Xikuo Gate. All those who build archways are gathered here, and the evening sun is chaotic, and the returning villagers all walk under the archways. Looking up at its forehead, most of them are old objects from the previous Ming dynasty in the city, while those outside Xikuo Gate were built at the beginning of this dynasty. It is said that the archways built before the Ming dynasty were good in the city, but in this dynasty, they knew that they would cause disaster to future generations, so they specially chose a vacant space outside the city.

### Children's Savings

— Qiulang

Saving is a virtue. Saving is storing unnecessary funds for use when needed. Dear children, although you cannot earn money during your schooling and cannot have a large amount of money to buy savings certificates, your parents and elder brothers may give you a small amount of candy and snack money every day. Your parents and brothers bear the expensive tuition fees in this difficult era and provide you with clothing and food. They only hope that you will study hard and be diligent and endure hardship, and so on, to be a good and kind child. Children's savings is also something you should do. When you get pocket money, do not buy candy or snacks to eat at will, because eating these is not only not very beneficial, but also, as the old saying goes, "The more you eat, the more greedy you become." Don't think it's a small amount and despise it. You must know that small amounts add up to a lot. "Save one cent a day, and in three years you will have ten yuan extra." Therefore, I advise you to quickly save this extra money, accumulate it day by day, one to cultivate good habits of thrift, and two, saving is to prepare for unexpected needs. If you have an urgent need, you can take it out and use it, avoiding the trouble of raising funds temporarily. Third, when you grow up and serve the country and society, there will be more places where you need money, so children's savings is very important. I hope you will all implement it from today!

### An Opportunity for Renewal

— Yang Chunlv

School has started! Children are back to living their lives at school!

Now, at the beginning of the school year, it’s a perfect opportunity for children to renew themselves. Whether they've moved up a grade, stayed in the same one, or even been held back, they should all examine themselves: Did they miss any classes in the past semester? What were the reasons for missing classes? How were their academic results? Which subjects are they not as good at as others? Do they have any physical defects? Have they had any illnesses? Do they have any bad habits? Have they done anything bad?

"If you have faults, don't hesitate to correct them." The ancients have already shown us the path to self-renewal. Children with weak bodies should pay attention to daily hygiene, practice exercise often, and strengthen their bodies. Children who are behind in their studies should concentrate on learning, strive for knowledge, and their studies will surely improve. Children with bad behavior should change their bad habits and cultivate good character. They should also not miss classes, obey discipline, pay attention to current events, be enthusiastic about service... Only then will they be a completely good student.

"Past mistakes will not be held against you, the future can be pursued!" Children! Rise up! Quickly create a "new me"!

### The Spirit of English Children

— Zhang Mengzhao

The spirit of English children! It can serve as a model for Chinese children during wartime! A report from Reuter's London states: A British ship carrying evacuated English children was hit by a German submarine torpedo in the Atlantic Ocean en route to Canada. However, none of the children were killed. The ship carried a total of 320 children... The only casualty was the ship's accountant. The children sang loudly as they left the ship into lifeboats! More than 70 of them, mostly wearing nightgowns, landed last night at a port in northern England... The children abandoned ship and boarded rescue ships in an orderly manner!... The Under-Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, Shakespeare, welcomed the survivors, saying: Their safe return is truly a miracle! The children were in high spirits upon landing! "As if nothing had happened..." and so on.

The calm and courageous spirit of English children in the face of danger! It can truly be said: "Not surprised when Mount Tai collapses in front of them, not afraid when a tiger stalks behind them." Children, after you finish reading this news report, think about your own situation and how the little angels in Chongqing are suffering amidst the bombings. If everyone can emulate the spirit of those English children, I believe that the cornerstone of a revitalized China will undoubtedly be built on your children. Children! Quickly develop your little hero spirit!

### A Dinner Party of Seven Foreign Children

— Hanqing

A Chinese child, an American child, an English child, a French child, a German child, an Italian child, and a Japanese child; these seven children one day, grouped together to have dinner at a cafe.

They had many good breads, pastries, and candies, as well as a large can of vegetable oil purchased at the cafe.

As they were happily eating, a strange insect suddenly fell from the air, landing right in the large can of vegetable oil.

The Chinese child was the first to see it, but he didn't say anything, and continued to sit and talk as before.

The American child saw it next, and he exclaimed loudly: "Ah! A very dirty monster has flown into this wonderful can of vegetable oil!"

The English child was annoyed by the American friend's loud exclamation, and said calmly: "Friend! Just get it out and remove some of the oil nearby!"

The French child curiously picked up the can to look at the monster, and said with admiration: "Ah! What a beautiful little thing, its two delicate wings are stuck to the vegetable oil."

The German child walked over silently, carefully took the insect out of the can, and said: "This is an uncommon insect, let me take it back and observe it carefully." Saying that, he looked at the insect, wrapped it up, and prepared to put it in his pocket to take it back.

The Japanese child suddenly stood up, snatched the paper package from the German child, and threw the insect back into the can of vegetable oil. He took it to the shop owner and said aggressively: "Bah! Look, there's this dirty thing in the vegetable oil, quickly exchange it for a new can! Otherwise, humph! Don't even think about getting our money!"

The Italian child was angered by the Japanese child's unreasonable behavior towards the German child, and prepared to fight; however, when he saw that the Japanese child had indeed obtained a new can of vegetable oil from the shop owner, he remained silent.

### Shirley Temple's Autobiography (14)

— Min

But Mom could only get me a salary of fifty gold dollars per week, and she couldn't get a good contract. Until the end of that summer, Mom received a phone call from the Educational Film Corporation, asking her to come and negotiate. It was said that they were going to start filming a series of short films called "Baby Burlesks" and were willing to give me a role. Mom immediately accepted, but the contract was still not finalized. They wanted me to first perform in one film as a test, and if the results were not bad, then I could continue. Almost all the actors in the film were middle school students, and there were also a few adults participating. The role I played was the little sister of a male student in the film. I was the youngest of all the actors, only four and a half years old at the time.

Corne, this is a good thing, you should know some. Although I had already made several films, I didn't go to the cinema often. Before I entered the film industry, Dad and Mom almost never went to the cinema. Dad would say to me that he didn't like movies. I remember the first movie I ever saw was Mickey Mouse, and I still think it's the best. Last year at the Academy Awards banquet, I met Mr. Walt Disney, the creator of Mickey Mouse, and I told him that I loved Mickey Mouse the most. Mr. Disney replied: "That's great, I'll send it to your house. If you really love it, then keep it." The next day, Mickey Mouse actually came: it wasn't the flat thing on the screen, but a substantial one like a black bear, and I also got its partner, Minnie. The two of them are still sitting in my toy cabinet, what a sweet couple!

Mom said that the first time I watched a film I starred in myself, it was in a cinema near my house. I kept laughing and clapping my hands. Mom kept whispering to me: "Can you see yourself? Hehe, that's you! That's you!" It's very interesting to see yourself appear on the screen. Corne, listening to the words you say evokes a very strange feeling. The sound seems especially loud, and I seem to want to warn myself: "Shirley, be quiet, if you keep making such a noise, I'm afraid you'll wake everyone up."

Dad was with us that first night to see my debut work. He was very happy after watching it. When it was all over, I saw that he seemed to be about to cry, clearly very moved. Now, all the new films I star in can be watched to our heart's content in the small cinema at the studio. We don't have to spend any money, and we can watch them whenever we want. Just call out to the person who runs the films: "Hey, hurry up and start it, we want to watch it." Then the lights go out immediately, and the film starts immediately.

### Talking About Goldfish

— Yuyin

Children like goldfish because of their beautiful colors. Indeed, golden red, tangerine yellow, snow white, jet black... swimming among green algae and white water is so poetic and picturesque! Moreover, in addition to their beautiful colors, their shapes also have unique features: crepe-like tail fins, round and tight bodies, paired with those bulging and round eyes, like a clown on the stage, very pleasing. Therefore, goldfish are not only liked by you children, but also by many adults who have lost their innocence and enjoy appreciating them.

Some people say that silkworm cocoons can be transformed into goldfish, which is nonsense. Don't believe it. How do goldfish become goldfish? Goldfish are originally a mutation of carp. According to a French zoologist, Mr. Tournier, "Goldfish have become the shape of goldfish because, in the early stages of their life, the energy of the embryo is weakened due to the lack of oxygen in the water." This is likely correct. Goldfish are indeed a kind of morbid mutation; we can prove it by observing the slow movement of goldfish. Those that are similar in shape to carp are easier to raise, healthier, and more lively, which is because their morbid state is lighter and they are less affected.

### Mid-Autumn Festival Play Talk

— Junmei

Besides "Celestial Fragrance Celebrates the Festival," "Chang'e Flying to the Moon," and "Emperor Tang Ming's Journey to the Moon Palace," there are truly few stage plays that are fitting for the Mid-Autumn Festival. And among these few plays, the main roles are all played by female characters, and the scenes are all extremely simple. Compared to the fiery and lively Qixi Festival plays, they are far inferior. Therefore, in recent years, the Peking Opera scene has used "Catching and Releasing Cao" and "Wujia Slope" as Mid-Autumn Festival plays, because the lyrics in "Catching and Releasing Cao" contain "Osmanthus fragrance in the Mid-Autumn of August," and "Wujia Slope" also has the line "The moon is bright on the fifteenth of August." They use these as a contrived association to embellish the festive season. In fact, the Mid-Autumn words in these two plays were not part of the scene at the time, and "Wujia Slope" is especially a narration of past events. As for those who criticize the actors for their ignorance for this reason, that is perhaps being too serious!

Mei Wan Hua became famous first in Qing Yi, and then his name became more prominent with ancient costume opera. The play "Chang'e Flying to the Moon" is undoubtedly Mei's masterpiece. At that time, Fan Fanshan, Yi Kukuang, and other elders highly praised Mei's play. During the Mid-Autumn Festival of a certain year in the early Republic of China, Wan Hua performed this play in the former capital, and Fan Shan recited a long song in praise of it, saying: "Tonight the people are good, and the moon is also good, the people in the moon are even more beautiful than flowers! Who can be called Chang'e? In ancient and modern times, Lanfang is the most beautiful." The passion was overflowing in his words. Since Mei's retirement from the singing stage, there have been very few talented newcomers in ancient costume opera, so even if "Chang'e Flying to the Moon" is performed during the Mid-Autumn Festival, it is often promoted with mechanical scenery, no longer with the beautiful singing and dancing of the past.

### Anecdotes from the Film World

— Qinghui

The late star Fan Pengke traveled to the East several years ago, and Mei Lanfang held a grand banquet for Fan at the Zhuiyu Xuan in Wuliangdaren Hutong in Beijing. Although Fan claimed to be a warrior, he especially admired ancient Chinese warriors. After a few drinks, he took off his Western suit and put on a Wu Song costume, and his brave spirit and generosity were praised by all who watched.

In the past, some people used flowers to compare the looks of female stars, saying: Hu Die resembles a peony, rich and magnificent, a rare treasure of Yaochi; Wang Ying resembles a cherry blossom, delicate and charming, full of stimulation; Xu Lai resembles a begonia, loved by the spring rain, and its voice is likened to the morning glow; Ruan Lingyu resembles an epiphyllum, a beautiful woman with a short life, a common tragedy throughout the ages; Hu Ping resembles a Jian orchid, pure and quiet; Gao Qianping resembles a grape, with many children and grandchildren; Diao Banhua resembles a monthly rose, which can be seen everywhere, and Lin Chuchu resembles a winter plum, ancient and fragrant.

The film world clown Han Langan usually looks funny, so he has many nicknames; one is "Skinny Monkey" because he is as thin as firewood and his appearance resembles a monkey; another is "Mantis Man" because his shoulders are high and he is thinner than a mantis; the third is "Bony Xi Shi" because he is all bones and especially acts coy.

Female stars are all very secretive about their real ages. In the past, when Yang Naimei was very popular, someone asked her how old she was, and she answered twenty-four! The following year, when another film producer asked, she answered twenty-four. Reducing her age year by year can be said to be interesting.

On the day of film queen Hu Die's wedding, she wore a black satin top with wide sleeves that opened in the front, about three feet long, with a red satin long skirt underneath. Her body was decorated with hundreds of silver butterflies of all sizes, and she wore a row of red flowers in her hair with white gauze on her shoulders that was four or five zhang long, extremely gorgeous.

Hawthorn Detective Case

### The Final Destination of the Dance Queen

— Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter Seven "Take Him Away"

Hawthorn said, "Since you said Xiao Zeng saw that person's face, how could you recognize him from those dark gray suit pants?"

"No, I also saw his face later." "Oh, so when did this time of trespassing and peeking happen?"

"Around eight o'clock after the clocks chimed. When we came out of the White Plum Restaurant a little before nine o'clock, I saw this Zhao fellow."

Hawthorn seemed to pay more attention. "How?"

"At that time, I was waiting for the car to come, but Li Lan grabbed my arm, looking very frightened. Her eyes were constantly looking left and right, and I naturally followed her gaze. Suddenly, she exclaimed, piercing my ears. I saw her gaze focused on the opposite side of the road, and sure enough, it was that Zhao fellow!"

I thought to myself that if this story was true, combined with Jinmei's description of Zhao Boxiong's nervous appearance when he went to Wang Lilan's house for dinner last night, it was indeed somewhat serious.

Hawthorn still asked lightly: "What happened after that? Did this Zhao fellow see you?"

Lu Jiansheng shook his head: "I don't know. I saw him for only a moment, and in the blink of an eye, he disappeared into the crowd. We were originally going to the Shanghai Theater to see 'Battlefield Oriole,' but at this time, Li Lan suddenly said she didn't want to go. I knew that she was frightened because of that Zhao fellow, so I tried my best to encourage her, and she reluctantly got into the car with me."

Hawthorn asked, "What time was it then?"

"Around nine o'clock, because the movie started at a quarter past nine."

"You must have asked her why she was afraid of this Zhao fellow. What did she say?"

"Yes, but I wasn't satisfied. She said that she originally didn't have any relationship with this person, but because I wanted her to break off contact with him, he hated her for it. Her words were very high-sounding, but I was afraid there was some other secret."

"How do you know? What is the basis for the secrets you mentioned? Because if she really listened to your words and suddenly broke up with him, it is also possible that he would hate her out of jealousy and threaten her." (107)

### Written Discussion of "One Horse, Two Riders"—Reply to Mr. Zheng Yaozu

— Dong Yunxiu Yan

I read Mr. Zheng Yaozu's article in yesterday's issue of this publication, regarding the "One Horse, Two Riders" scene in my book "Twenty Kinds of Ballads," which is part of the "Civil and Military Scented Ball" chapter. I am grateful for his insight.

Mr. Zheng's opinion is that when "One Horse, Two Riders" are on the horse, Long Guanbao should have his limbs tied behind his back, and be tied to Zhang Guiying back-to-back. The reason is that there are two reasons: Second, because Long Guanbao is a weak scholar, he is afraid that he will not be able to withstand the bumps on horseback. Second, Long Guanbao's hands are free, and he may have unruly behavior.

The first point has a considerable reason; the second point is just a "gimmick" of the "ballad singer."

According to the facts, even if Zhang Guiying is agile, she would definitely not dare to tie Long Guanbao behind her back! Just imagine: with a six-foot-tall man tied behind her back, galloping across the mountains, is that something a young woman can handle? As for "preventing problems before they happen," fearing that Guanbao's hands may have unruly behavior, it is even more unreasonable! At this time when everything hangs by a thread and life is at stake, how can there be such leisure?

The same ballad has several versions. Ju Yuquan's version is one way of telling the story, while Chen Lianqing and Qi Lianfang's version is another way. There is no absolute right or wrong in the world, and we certainly don't have to "stick to the string while playing the lute."

We are just discussing with Mr. Zheng, not "arguing." We are truly grateful for Mr. Zheng's well-intentioned discussion!
