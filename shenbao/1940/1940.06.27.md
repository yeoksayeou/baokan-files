### British Troops Suddenly Land on the Other Side of the Strait Fiercely Attacking German Positions Taking Advantage of the German Army's Unstable Foothold to Implement Blitzkrieg Tactics British Spitfire Aircraft Assist in Battle, Invincible

London - Today, the official announcement states that in order to counter the German army's blitzkrieg, Britain launched a sudden land attack yesterday against the German forces concentrated on the French coast of the English Channel. British troops landed at several locations on the French coast of the strait, attacking German positions. The German army suffered heavy casualties. This move by the British army is the first of its kind since the outbreak of the European war. After the sudden landing of British troops, the German army was defeated, and most were captured. According to an intelligence department communique, the British landing forces suffered no casualties. News of the British attack on German positions in the strait has greatly excited the British people. Observers predict that the British army will launch a massive attack on the German army in France, and believe that the British command will not be satisfied with this small victory, but will continue to advance fiercely before the German army has built its permanent consolidation in France. At the same time, the British Air Ministry announced that nine British Spitfire aircraft, while patrolling the French coast during the British landing operation yesterday, encountered seventeen German Messerschmitt aircraft and, after a fierce aerial battle, shot down six German aircraft. All British aircraft returned safely. (United Press dispatch, 26th)

London - A Reuters military correspondent reports that British troops have landed at various points along the enemy coastline and are in contact with German forces. He states that this movement indicates that Germany, with its navy greatly weakened after engaging with the Allied navies, is attempting to defend the entire northern coastline (from North Cape along the coasts of Norway, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, and France, all the way to the Spanish border), which carries a significant responsibility. At various points along this vast coastline, especially at the ports of the Strait, all defense construction and harbor projects were destroyed by the Allied forces before the German occupation. In addition to these vulnerable points in the defense line, the German side must also allocate a large number of troops along the thousands of miles of coastline to guard against possible attacks by Britain's overwhelmingly superior naval power.

Content of the Franco-Italian Agreement

Rome - The armistice terms signed by France and Italy on Monday stipulate, among other things, that Italy has full authority to use the port of Djibouti in East Africa and all its facilities, and to utilize the French section of the Djibouti-Addis Ababa railway for transportation. The armistice agreement stipulates several demilitarized zones, including: (1) A zone 50 kilometers wide, drawn as a straight line, between certain lines in mainland France outside the original Italian border, to be demilitarized during the armistice; (2) The military zone between the existing Tunisia-Libya border and a line drawn on the map to be demilitarized during the armistice; (3) In French Africa, south of Algeria and bordering Libya, a 200-kilometer zone adjacent to the Libyan border to be designated as a demilitarized zone during the armistice; (4) The coast of French Somaliland to be completely demilitarized during Italy's war against Britain and the armistice with France. French troops must withdraw from all demilitarized zones within ten days after the armistice. Only personnel strictly necessary for the management and maintenance of fortifications, barracks, arsenals, and military buildings, and troops needed to maintain domestic order, as determined by the Italian armistice commission in the future, may be permitted to remain. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)

Rome - The Franco-Italian armistice terms, announced in Rome last night, stipulate that the French fleet is to be concentrated in designated ports, where, under Italian and German supervision, the crews are to be disbanded and the ships disarmed, except for warships determined by the Italian and German governments to be used to protect French colonies. All warships not in French mainland territorial waters, except those recognized by Italy and Germany as necessary for protecting French colonial interests, shall be recalled to domestic ports. The Italian government declares that it has no intention of using French warships under its control in the current war, nor does it intend to make demands on the French fleet when peace is achieved. During the armistice, the Italian government may request French warships to engage in mine sweeping. French authorities shall clear mines within ten days from all coastal areas and naval bases that are to be demilitarized. During the Italo-British war, the naval bases of Toulon (southern France), Bizerte (Tunisia), Ajaccio (Corsica), and Oran (northwestern Algeria), and coastal military and defensive fortification zones, must be demilitarized within fifteen days. To guarantee the implementation of the armistice agreement, Italy may demand that all weapons, armored vehicles, tanks, motor vehicles, horse-drawn carriages, and ammunition of the French troops resisting the Italian army be handed over to the Italian side. The first article of the Franco-Italian armistice terms stipulates that France must cease hostilities in its mainland territory, French North African colonies, and mandated territories. France must terminate naval and air warfare. The second article stipulates that during the implementation of the armistice terms and during the armistice, Italian troops will be stationed on the front lines of all war zones. All French merchant ships must remain in port, pending permission from the German and Italian governments to resume some or all of French commercial navigation. All French cargo ships not in French ports or ports under French jurisdiction at the time of the armistice must be recalled to the aforementioned ports or ordered to sail to neutral seaports. Italian cargo ships carrying cargo, and Italian goods or goods taken off non-Italian ships bound for Italy, must be returned. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)

Shackled by Harsh Conditions Pétain Broadcasts to Amuse Himself

Bordeaux - General Pétain recently broadcast to the French people at home and abroad, saying: "My army will soon be demobilized, my materials will be handed over to the enemy, my fortresses will be destroyed, my fleet will be disarmed in various seaports, and the naval bases in the Mediterranean will also be demilitarized. But our honor has been salvaged. No one will use our aircraft and fleet. We will retain the naval and land forces necessary to maintain order. My government still maintains freedom, and France will only be ruled by French people." (Reuters dispatch, 26th)

### Joint British and French Forces in the Far East Sufficient to Resist Any Aggression Statement by the Governor-General of Vietnam

London - The Governor-General of French Vietnam has long declared that if Britain fights to the end, he will never surrender. The public attaches great importance to this statement. According to the Governor-General, the French navy in the Far East is much larger than generally estimated. He firmly believes that the joint British and French forces in the Near East and Far East are sufficient to resist any aggression and prevent Japan from seizing Vietnam. (International News Service dispatch, 26th)

### American Journalist Predicts Future British-German Strategy Naval and Air Forces are the Decisive Factors

New York - Hitler is now able to utilize the Italian air force to attack Britain. Hitler today can dispense with land invasion and, by exploiting the air power from properly seized airfields, launch a widespread aerial blitzkrieg against Britain to force its surrender. Britain will certainly make every effort to defend against this terrifying aerial attack by utilizing every available aircraft. However, the numerical superiority of German aircraft may make it difficult for Britain to cope. Hitler is in a win-or-lose situation. If he fails, air supremacy will fall into British hands. German operations may adopt a method of laying mines in the narrow waters of the English Channel to protect troop transport and deploying aircraft to patrol the skies over the Channel to defend against British air attacks. Heavy artillery could be positioned in French territory to prevent the British fleet from hindering German operations. As for Britain, it will certainly make every effort to defend on land to resist a German landing. Even if German troops manage to land in London, they will suffer heavy losses, as the large number of elite British troops will fiercely resist after the German landing. However, the German army may adopt another method, which is to concentrate a large air force at the Belgian airfields closest to Britain. In this case, the German army can bomb Britain with 500 to 1,000 aircraft per day to destroy British military production. This air raid can continue until all British resistance is completely eliminated. The German army can also launch large-scale air strikes against British naval ports and fleet concentration points. If the British navy is destroyed, Britain will have no resistance. If Britain and Germany engage in combat, the losses on both sides will be staggering. Unless the British air force is completely destroyed, the British government is unlikely to flee overseas, and the British navy, unless all naval ports are completely destroyed, will not leave for other places. If all naval ports are destroyed, the British domestic fleet may be forced to leave. Its destination after leaving Britain should be the Mediterranean, where it can join the originally stationed Allied fleet. If it is absolutely necessary, Canada may be a suitable refuge for the fleet. If not Canada, then Singapore is a better place. The British fleet in Singapore can also protect the safety of Australia and British territories in the South Seas. (United Press dispatch, 26th)

### France Blames Britain for Defeat French Propaganda to the Outside World London Dismisses it as Untrue

Bordeaux - Provost, the French High Commissioner for Propaganda, told American reporters yesterday that Britain should have sent 26 divisions of British troops to France in the first few months after the start of the war, but the British government later claimed that it could not send untrained troops due to lack of military supplies and barracks. Provost then reviewed the situation before the armistice, saying that the French government had determined on June 12 that the complete occupation of France was almost inevitable. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)

London - Responsible parties here declared that the remarks of Provost, the French High Commissioner for Propaganda, were inaccurate. The statement that Britain should have sent 26 divisions of troops to France in the first few months after the start of the war is not true. The British government had told the French government at the time that British military efforts in the first year would be limited. In reality, Britain had sent 400,000 troops and had done its best. Britain's contribution in the air far exceeded its promises. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)

Editorial

### Fluctuations in Japanese Politics

According to news from the day before yesterday, Konoe has resigned from the position of President of the Privy Council. This is a sign that the New Party Movement is brewing to maturity and an important marker in the fluctuations of the Japanese political situation. If the future does not encounter special obstacles, it is likely that its political situation will change rapidly. As early as a few months ago, Japanese public opinion had the argument that the period between June and July would be the time for the cabinet to fall. This prediction is now not far from being realized.

The main driving force behind this fluctuation is, in a nutshell, two things: First, the activity of the New Party Movement, and second, the dissatisfaction of general reformers with the conservative policies of the Japanese authorities. Both of these have triggered a stronger reaction due to the dramatic changes in the European situation. For three years, Japanese public opinion has been extremely complex, and cabinets have been changed repeatedly. However, the superficial dynamics have not improved the political situation; on the contrary, things have gotten worse, pushing itself further into a state of embarrassment where it cannot make ends meet and is at a loss. This is sufficient proof that Japan's difficulties have their main source elsewhere. Only because they cannot understand this thoroughly and only engage in superficial patch-up and repair, they are ultimately good for nothing. As for this recent fluctuation, although its meaning is no different from the past, it is relatively broader and deeper, and there is a view that it will touch on the fundamental political system. This shows that the Japanese public and officials are suffering and anxious, and it is no longer enough to simply change personnel and policies on the surface. If the Japanese political situation is really going to evolve in this new direction, can it solve Japan's difficulties? Will everything conform to the ideas of the so-called reformers? These are issues that are difficult to answer accurately at present.

The center of gravity currently supported by the Japanese New Party Movement is Konoe. Assuming the movement is successful, the person who will bear the burden of the current situation in the future must also be Konoe. Konoe's personality is multifaceted, and in this movement, those who are on his left and right are those pro-military figures of the so-called reform camp. Currently, the brewing of the New Party has gained the support of the Seiyukai's three factions, the Social Mass Party, and the Minseito's Nagai faction. Although the Minseito itself has not yet made a clear statement, it is unlikely that it will hinder the formation of the New Party. Based on this political situation, what is called the New Party will not have much "qualitative" change at first, but only a change in "form." In other words, at most, it will be a group of reformers reorganized from the original political parties. In addition, it may not be able to absorb a large number of new and powerful elements. That is, it may not have any wonderful functions. Even in terms of the current so-called reformers, their social foundation is still in question. Therefore, when it becomes a party in the future, it cannot be said that it must be looked at with new eyes. It is better to say that one should wait and see what happens. Indeed, the Japanese middle class is extremely fragile, and the industrial world is stuck in feudalism. Therefore, it can be said that it lacks the basic conditions to form a unified political party like Germany and Italy. Even if it takes a lot of effort to force it together, it is only an advance team in the political field under the command of the military. If it is said that this will launch the national power and grasp the levers of various levels, then there is still a very, very long distance between them. Of course, objectively, it cannot be denied that it is a new institution, a new form, or a new force that is being created. Moreover, this new force has invaded the layer of elder statesmen with Kido's succession as Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal. However, the conservative forces of the industrial world, which have always held economic power, cannot be underestimated. In short, the internal opposition in Japan cannot be eliminated with a snap of the fingers, and therefore it is impossible to imagine that the New Party can melt these conflicting forces into one furnace. To expect it to pull today's Japan out of the quagmire is either ignoring reality or deceiving oneself. The New Party Movement has always been one of Konoe's ambitions. The overthrow of the previous Konoe Cabinet was due to the obstruction of the national reorganization movement he advocated, which was also a posture of the New Party Movement. Now, after a year and a half, although things have changed, there are still many obstacles in its future. As for Konoe himself, he was the person in charge when the Sino-Japanese War broke out and the founder of the so-called East Asia New Order theory. Now, at the stage when Japan is feeling unprecedented difficulties, he is being regarded as the only person who can bear the burden of the current situation. The future is unknowable. At present, it is still impossible to make an early criticism of him. However, judging from all his words and deeds in the past year, he is obviously still mired in the abyss of confusion. Apart from clinging to the disjointed theory he created, he has no real courage and awareness to recognize reality. Whether Konoe will only be the one who is supported by the reformers in the future, or whether he himself has other ambitions, is unknowable. However, if he cannot be thoroughly enlightened and change his course, even if he comes to power again, his future will not be better than that of his predecessors.

As pointed out earlier, the recent dramatic changes in the European situation are the main cause of the various fluctuations in the Japanese political situation. But in fact, the current situation in the Far East has not changed due to the European situation, nor has there been any factor that is beneficial to Japan. At the very least, Germany and Italy are not interested in the East Asian territories of Britain, France, and the Netherlands at present. This can be proved by the armistice conditions of Germany, France, and Italy. At the same time, although the calls for Japan to strengthen its ties with Germany and Italy are loud, Germany and Italy seem to have turned a deaf ear and have not encouraged or welcomed them. Japanese radicals have recently criticized the past government for not joining the German-Italian alliance, which resulted in the loss of the opportunity to share the spoils. In fact, it was not entirely due to Japan's hesitant attitude from the beginning. The main reason was still the passivity of Germany and Italy towards Japan. Therefore, even if Japan is really preparing to modify its "non-joining" policy and attach itself to Germany and Italy, apart from relying on Japan's own remaining strength, there are no other factors that can be used for leverage. Moreover, even if there is a border demarcation agreement between the Soviet Union and Japan, it cannot guarantee that relations between the Soviet Union and Japan will improve. Even Shiratori Toshio, who is known as an extremist, is worried that there is no guarantee of adjusting Soviet-Japanese relations, which will hinder the future of Japan's southward policy. On the other hand, the United States' concern for the current situation in the Far East is becoming increasingly profound. Stimson's entry into the cabinet is a clear proof of this. The likes of Matsui and Sueyoshi only saw that Britain and France were suffering setbacks and launched a large-scale attack on the conservative policies of the current cabinet, calling for the possibility of eliminating British and French forces in the Far East. But they ignored the fact that Japan itself is suffering more severe consumption than Britain and France, and they have no memory of the fact that in the Far East, in addition to Britain and France, there are also the United States, the Soviet Union, and China, which are determined to resist. If Japan really seizes the opportunity of political turmoil and acts recklessly, it will only bring upon itself consequences that are more tragic than the war of aggression against China.

Having ambition but lacking strength, abandoning reason and advocating emotion, is the fundamental weakness of today's Japan. If there is a lack of awareness on this point, then any exercise will be in vain. The current fluctuations in the Japanese political situation are only a final struggle in a dead end.

Bridges at the Border Between Hong Kong, China, and Britain Are All Destroyed

Hong Kong: As local authorities announced that they had declared a state of alert in response to the deployment of Japanese scouting parties around Hong Kong, all bridges at the border between Britain and China were immediately destroyed. According to a British military spokesperson, the destruction of these bridges was purely for border security purposes, and the authorities strongly emphasized that there was no need for alarm. Currently, residents of Hong Kong are not showing any signs of panic. As for the Japanese side, they have occupied Suozhong and Dapeng Bay this morning, completing their encirclement of Hong Kong. According to the Japanese, the occupation of Dapeng Bay is to block the channels used by China to transport munitions through Hong Kong. According to Chinese reports, when the Japanese troops, numbering four hundred, occupied Dapeng Bay, they also destroyed the customs office and the market there. (United Press dispatch of the 26th)

Hong Kong: In light of the recent attitude of Japanese newspapers, purely defensive precautionary measures have been taken here, including the demolition of two bridges on the border and the strengthening of various outposts along the border. At the same time, an official spokesperson firmly denied the Japanese claim that munitions or other military materials are being transported from Hong Kong to China, stating that the limited amount of goods passing through Hong Kong to China is restricted to food, coal oil, and miscellaneous items. Today, apart from occasional reconnaissance flights by Japanese aircraft, there has been no military activity along the border. (Reuters dispatch of the 26th)

Hong Kong: Officials announced today that the various actions being taken here are purely self-defense measures to cope with the Japanese military installations around Hong Kong this week.

### Japanese Navy Claims Japanese Fleet Has Left for Haiphong to Monitor Goods Transported to China from Vietnam; Japanese Troops in South China Also Launch Operations

Tokyo: Japanese troops in South China announced last night that several Japanese units have begun operations in South China to prevent war materials from being transported into China via Vietnam. These operations are due to the fact that "Japan has repeatedly protested against the transport of war materials through Indochina, but the transport continues unabated." The statement said that Japanese troops in South China have decided to use force to stop the transport of these munitions, and the operations began on June 17. The statement did not mention the location of the operations. The Japanese Navy announced yesterday that a portion of the Japanese fleet has set off for Haiphong to "monitor the transport of goods through Vietnam." At the same time, the Foreign Ministry claimed that the recent Franco-Japanese agreement prohibits the transport of supplies from Vietnam to Chongqing, so Japan is preparing to send several military experts and government officials to Haiphong to investigate whether the Franco-Japanese agreement is being faithfully implemented. (United Press dispatch of the 26th)

Washington: Government officials here are closely monitoring Japan's movements in South China, but declined to indicate whether the United States would take any action if Japan attempted to occupy French Vietnam. No official statement has been issued regarding Japan's implied occupation of several ports in Vietnam and the news that a portion of the Japanese fleet has set off for Haiphong to "monitor the transport of goods through Vietnam." Although the United States has not specifically clarified its attitude towards French Vietnam, it has repeatedly and clearly stated its position on the Dutch East Indies, which are not far from the French colony. Secretary of State Hull recently stated that the United States would be seriously concerned about any attempt to undermine the sovereignty or status quo of the East Indies. (United Press dispatch of the 26th)

Tokyo: A Japanese army spokesman recently denied that Japanese troops had crossed the Vietnamese border, and said that the Japanese authorities had no intention of taking such action at present. Japanese troops may have entered the border area of South China in order to seize any military supplies passing through Vietnam to Chongqing. (United Press dispatch of the 25th)

Tokyo: Two Douglas aircraft recently carrying more than twenty Japanese inspectors took off from Tokyo, accompanied by Thibaut, the military attaché of the French Embassy. Due to the bad weather, they were forced to land midway. It is reported that the aircraft will continue to fly to Hanoi tomorrow. (United Press dispatch of the 26th)

Tokyo: A Foreign Ministry spokesman told reporters today that as far as we are concerned, France only has one government, that is, the government that has moved from Paris to Bordeaux. The Japanese ambassador is still stationed in Bordeaux, and we are currently negotiating with that government on the Vietnam issue. We believe that the French ambassador in Tokyo is appointed by the Bordeaux government. Someone asked if the Japanese government had protested to the British government about the transport of munitions to China via Burma, and had received a reply from the British government. The spokesman replied, no. Someone also asked if the Japanese government had consulted with the Soviet Union to stop the transport of munitions to Chongqing via the so-called Northwest Highway. The spokesman replied that the government had not yet considered this. (Reuters dispatch of the 26th)

Manila: Chinese and English newspapers here today published commentaries on the activities of the Japanese army on the Vietnamese border, saying that Vietnam will immediately become a battlefield for the Chinese and Japanese armies. The American-owned "Manila Daily Bulletin" said that the current tense situation in the Far East may cause the wars in Europe and Asia to meet in Vietnam. The Chinese Foreign Minister's statement that China would take action if Japan attacked Vietnam indicates that the Chinese war will immediately spread to Vietnam. Because most of the French in Vietnam are in favor of continuing to resist Germany and Italy, China will eventually become an ally of the democratic countries. As for Japan, the cost of its war has been too expensive and is about to bankrupt its economic structure. If it wants to seize Vietnam, it will inevitably increase its cost. The newspaper also pointed out that the Soviet Union's attitude towards the possible Japanese rule of Vietnam is not as good as the current French rule of Vietnam. If Japan occupies the land, it will see the gateway for communication between China and the Soviet Union opened wide, and Soviet military supplies can be imported into China, rendering the Japanese blockade ineffective. "China Commercial News" said that in order to protect its lifeline, China must take active measures to prevent Vietnam from becoming a base for Japan to attack southwest China. Recent facts have clearly shown that the country that first initiates a solution to international disputes often enjoys great benefits. At present, it is ineffective to negotiate with Japan or France, which is losing. Only by using force can we protect our interests. The "New China Daily" condemned France for violating international treaties and complying with Japanese demands. The newspaper said that France did not consult with the United States and China in advance. It should be known that the United States has commercial relations in China and countless interests in the Pacific. This kind of situation must be discussed with the United States. "Only by adopting a tit-for-tat attitude can we hope to protect our independence, maintain the status quo in the Far East, and destroy Japan's ambition to conquer the Pacific and the world."

### Britain Determined to Fight to the End, Seeking Liberation for the French Nation; British Prime Minister Bitterly Condemns Pétain for Selling Out the National Soul, Abandoning Promises and Using the Fleet to Aid the Enemy

London: The "Daily Telegraph" published an editorial criticizing Prime Minister Churchill's speech in the House of Commons yesterday. Although he bitterly condemned French Prime Minister Pétain and his supporters, he said, "We know that the heart of France is not in their chests." The article was titled, "France and Its Empire," and said that no matter what suffering and gloom France will encounter in the near future, yesterday's prime minister's speech contained the voice of the belief that France will surely rise again. The military commanders and administrators of the French Empire have made a resolution, proving that they can be expected to firmly use abundant resources, the manpower of 63 million people, and great military power to continue to fight for freedom. Like General Mittelhauser, who announced in Syria that he would carry out the mission of France and defend the glory of the French flag, Churchill hoped that the French Empire would build a government that represents the spirit of France and manage the liberation of France with the perseverance of its great era. This is a task we must devote all our efforts to, because liberalism is indivisible. The current situation hangs on the tyranny of the reviving barbarism and the civilization of unyielding freedom. We don't need to waste our words to belittle the Bordeaux government. No matter what Pétain's intentions are, he has allowed himself and his cabinet to become Hitler's puppets. The history of the Bordeaux government's handling of French affairs, as Churchill said yesterday, the French will be the best judges. In this critical moment of life and death, France has this generation of people in charge of national affairs, and the Allies who are being betrayed and fighting alone are deeply saddened. However, we know that the heart of France is not in their chests. The British government had complied with Reynaud's (former French Prime Minister) request to lift France's solemn promise not to negotiate separately with Germany, and on the condition that the French fleet must sail to British ports when applying for armistice conditions. Unexpectedly, Marshal Pétain took over as Prime Minister at this time and began negotiations with Germany, ignoring the condition that the French fleet would never fall into German hands. There were many solemn guarantees, and Marshal Pétain was one of the guarantors, but Pétain and his government approved the armistice conditions containing the provision that the French fleet, together with its armaments, should be controlled by Germany or Italy. This is really the most absurd surrender ever. The Pétain government may have believed that it was impossible to preserve more land outside a corner of France, so it abandoned the French Empire and made the French people peel off their skin and bones, with no hope of obtaining any overseas assistance. Now, as Churchill said yesterday, the security of our own country and empire, due to the encounter of the French fleet, has been greatly affected, although it has not been decisively affected. We should not speculate on the trend of events, but should rely on the various plans adopted by our own government and rely on the steadfast and resolute words made by the authorities to us. (Reuters dispatch of the 26th)

London: Lord Caldecote, Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, made a speech in the House of Lords yesterday, which was slightly different. Lord Caldecote said that he feared that France's surrender had made it almost inevitable that formal relations between Britain and France would be temporarily severed, but he was responsible for ensuring that if there was any contact that could be maintained, Britain would not lose the opportunity to go there. Lord Caldecote also discussed the fate of the French fleet, saying that everyone knows that this fleet can give Germany or Britain a strong boost. Our defense will indeed partly rely on the French ships that have recently been fighting with the British Navy in the Mediterranean. Once the force that recently served the Allies is transferred to the enemies of Britain and France, it will be even more unfortunate. (Reuters dispatch of the 26th)

### Former French Cabinet Members Go to London to Organize a New Government of Resistance

London: The Liberal Party's organ "News Chronicle" recently reported that two main cabinet members of former French Prime Minister Reynaud's cabinet, namely Interior Minister Mandel and Navy Minister Campinchi, have set off from France to London to join the French National Committee initiated by General de Gaulle. In addition, the foreign affairs reporter of the "Daily Mail" also said that several famous French politicians have already set off to join the National Committee. They hope to organize a new government, or move to the French territory of North Africa. Former French Prime Minister Reynaud will also arrive in London in a short period of time. (Havas dispatch of the 25th)

New York: Several influential French people here published an article stating that the current French government, which recognizes enemy-occupied land, is no longer in a position to represent or guarantee France's permanent interests. The British government has asked French people living in free areas to continue fighting to seek final victory, and has repeatedly stated its determination to restore all of France's complete rights and land. We would like to express our gratitude for this. (Reuters dispatch of the 26th)

London: General de Gaulle, the initiator of the French National Committee, received many telegrams from French expatriates in the colonies of Britain and France this month, expressing sympathy and vowing to support him. (Havas dispatch of the 25th)

London: Although Prime Minister Churchill said that the fully armed French fleet would be transferred to the German side, French people here have a hope that most of the French fleet, which is now fighting in conjunction with the British fleet, will continue to resist the Axis powers. According to some French naval commanders, they have recently reaffirmed their determination to continue to fight with Britain. According to reliable sources, some French fleets left French military ports when the Franco-German armistice negotiations first began. As for the famous French people in the United States, they all have a hope that the United States will immediately break off relations with the Bordeaux puppet government and will recognize the true government representing the true will of the French people, which is being organized in London. According to the British official opinion, although the diplomatic relations between Britain and the Bordeaux government have not been completely severed in reality, Britain will still give full support to the French National Committee so that it can establish a new French government in British territory. According to reports from the United States, Britain may move its own fleet to Singapore, but British officials believe that this news is unfounded. It is claimed that Britain has 120% confidence in its ability to resist any German invasion, and that the British Air Force is now becoming stronger and stronger. Judging from the recent large-scale German air raids on Britain, the losses suffered by Britain have been minimal, which shows that the effectiveness of the British defense system has greatly increased. As for President Roosevelt's cancellation of the sale of torpedo boats, a certain official here commented, saying that he fully understands President Roosevelt's move. Although Britain feels frustrated by this loss, it is by no means resentful. The British government is deeply grateful for President Roosevelt's extreme sympathy and all-out assistance to the Allies.

### Japan's Ambition for Hegemony Increasingly Apparent; Actually Preparing to Announce "East Asia Monroe Doctrine"

Tokyo: When a Foreign Ministry spokesman was entertaining reporters today, he was asked if it was true that the Japanese government had decided to issue a proclamation of the East Asia Monroe Doctrine in the near future. The spokesman replied that he could not comment on the matter at this time. This morning, the Asahi Shimbun carried a news item stating that the Japanese government was likely to announce the East Asia Monroe Doctrine within days, expressing Japan's determination to defend peace in this part of the world and promote its happiness, as a stabilizing power in East Asia. Japan's non-intervention in the European war would not change, but Japan intends to solidify its position in East Asia as a stabilizing power, in order to prevent the impact of the European war from spreading to this part of the world. The Yomiuri Shimbun stated that Japan's policy of non-intervention in the European war is a positive policy, not a strict neutrality policy, which smaller countries can implement. Japan, by consolidating its position as a stabilizing force in East Asia, is attempting to resolve the issues of the Dutch East Indies and French Indochina by following the East Asia Monroe Doctrine and a policy of self-sufficiency in this part of the world. Japan will neither side with Germany and Italy nor with Britain and the United States, but will pursue a policy of independent action. (Reuters, 26th)

### US Republican Party Platform Committee Passes Election Procedures; Vigorously Opposes US Entry into War; Attacks Roosevelt's Defense Record

Philadelphia: The Republican Party Platform Committee yesterday passed the party's election procedures, including advocating aid to oppressed people, pledging to oppose the United States' entry into the war, and sharply attacking President Roosevelt's record on defense matters. Former President Hoover, speaking at the Republican National Convention yesterday, warned the nation to prepare to defend the Western Hemisphere, stating that "We should facilitate the acquisition of materials and munitions by those who struggle for freedom, but only with such definite limitations as will avoid involvement in war ourselves." He added, "We naturally sympathize with the democracies struggling for freedom. America must arm so that no nation will contemplate starting across three thousand miles of ocean. We need a navy of unprecedented strength." He also said, "Our industry must be adjusted to produce munitions faster and better than any nation in the world." Finally, he opposed American intervention in European affairs, saying that "Even if we join, in this unprepared state, it will take two or three years to be ready. To declare war now would do more harm than good to the Allied side." (Reuters, 26th)

### Soviet Union Changes Work System; Strengthens Strength to Cope with Crisis; National Federation of Trade Unions Urges Workers to Step Up Production; Expand Military Armaments to Consolidate National Defense and Economic Strength

Moscow: The Central Committee of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions of the Soviet Union recently issued a circular to workers, engineers, technicians, and company employees as follows: "The capitalist world is now shaken again by a world war. The number of people drawn into this Second Imperialist War has exceeded half of the world's population. In this capitalist world (including Europe, Asia, the Americas, Africa, and Australia), all industry, transportation, and agriculture have succumbed to the interests of war. Capitalists are stepping up exploitation as much as possible, workers are working ten to twelve hours a day, and Sundays and holidays have been cancelled. The economy has been militarized, and the imperialists are massively increasing arms production. Under such circumstances, the crisis in our country has become heavier, and the international situation has changed dramatically. Therefore, in order to protect the interests of the people of the Soviet Union, our country has no choice but to further strengthen its national defense and economic strength. In terms of armaments and other necessities, our preparations should not be inferior to those of any capitalist country. In order to prepare to cope with the situation, we must be several times stronger than we are at present. In short, whether in military or economic terms, we must become stronger."

Soviet Working Masses Should Make Necessary Sacrifices

"Our current important tasks are (1) to further strengthen national defense capabilities, (2) to strengthen the Red Army, Navy, and Air Force, (3) to expand armaments, and (4) to strengthen socialist industry, to provide the Red Army with various military supplies. We should use all our strength to further develop industry, thereby consolidating our country's position. We need more steel, oil, more airplanes, tanks, and artillery shells, more perfect automobiles, machines, and the highest rate of production in all sectors of the national economy. In order to further strengthen the country's strength, the Soviet working masses must decide to make all necessary sacrifices. The Central Committee of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions believes that the current six-hour and seven-hour work system in the Soviet Union is not enough to cope with the work we should do. In capitalist countries, workers are forced to work ten to twelve hours a day, so our Soviet working masses must work at least eight hours a day. The Soviet working masses are working for themselves, and at the same time, they are working for the Soviet state and the people. The Central Committee of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions believes that, in the current state, all employees of state-owned and public institutions should increase their working hours to eight hours. At the same time, the number of working days will also increase. For example, institutions with a seven-hour work system should extend their working hours to seven to eight hours, while institutions with a six-hour work system should extend their working hours to six to seven hours, but this does not apply to those who are physically weak. In addition, company employees and those aged sixteen and under should work six to eight hours."

Strictly Prohibit Unauthorized Absences and Violators Will Be Judicially Punished

"Even after extending the working hours by one hour, the working hours of Soviet workers are still the shortest in the world, while productivity is the highest. Most Soviet workers can do their jobs, but there are also three or four percent of young people who do not work very well. They have only recently joined production work. They take advantage of the fact that there are no unemployed people in the Soviet Union, destroy discipline, are unwilling to work, run around, and disregard the laws passed by the people. The Central Committee of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions believes that all acts of abandoning jobs or arbitrarily changing occupations must be strictly prohibited. From now on, anyone who leaves their post without permission will be subject to judicial punishment and imprisonment. At the same time, those who attempt to evade work will also be punished, and a portion of their wages will be withheld indefinitely by the relevant competent authorities. The Central Committee of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions has submitted the following recommendations to the government and the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet: (1) Extend working hours to eight hours, (2) Change the six-day working week to a seven-day working week, (3) Strictly prohibit all unauthorized acts of desertion. The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet and the government have approved the recommendations. The Central Committee of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions is convinced that all men and women workers, technicians, and all members of the Union will also support this step. They will fulfill their tasks to the socialist motherland, and they will further consolidate the military and economic strength of the motherland with a new heroic posture, and move forward for the new victory of communism and the great doctrine of Lenin and Stalin."

### US Department of the Army Drafts War Plan; Large Army Can Be Sent Overseas; No Transportation Difficulties in New York

New York: During the testimony of witnesses in a shipping case before the Federal Commerce Commission, it was unintentionally discovered that the railway companies had jointly planned a scheme with the US Army, that is, when the American Expeditionary Force is sent overseas, a large number of troops can be shipped from the port of New York without causing congestion in the port. The speaker was Randall, the transportation administrator of the Port of New York and chairman of the General Affairs Committee of the Working and Transportation Division of the American Railway Association. He had compiled a formal report stating that the Port of New York, although its wartime tonnage requirements have increased, will not be congested. When Hickey, a lawyer from New Jersey, asked about the transportation during the World War in 1918 yesterday, "The situation at that time was that our army set out and got confused," Randall replied, "Yes." Hickey continued to ask, "Were there nearly two million soldiers who embarked from New York?" He replied, "I believe so." He asked, "This kind of situation will certainly not happen again today," and answered, "Yes, we have planned it." "Is it for transporting two million people?" asked, "Any number can be transported," replied. Randall did not elaborate on the plan, as it is part of the Army's secret war plan, and officials at the Second Corps Area headquarters on Long Island in New York Harbor did not criticize the matter. Military experts said that there is no need to panic, as the authorities have planned various emergency war plans, including civil unrest and war with foreign countries. This plan has been revised from time to time since the World War. The New York Times said that the plan mentioned by Randall is now believed to have no special relationship with the current European war, but was drafted before the outbreak of the war in Europe, but must have been revised after September of last year in accordance with past practice. Randall mentioned that the transportation facilities of the Port of New York are suitable for handling the transportation of a large number of troops, while also being able to handle the transportation of a large amount of goods.

### US Has Laid Mines at Both Ends of Panama Canal; Rumor That US Fleet Is Stationed in Atlantic to Prevent German and Italian Forces from Invading South America

Washington: Local newspapers have reported that the US fleet has sailed from the Hawaiian Islands to the US Pacific coast and the Panama Canal area. The White House secretary, O'Reilly, refused to release any information about this news. Naval circles are also keeping silent, but according to diplomatic circles, the US fleet is likely to sail to the Atlantic, or may be undertaking an important mission, so that when the British Navy's blockade of German and Italian forces is insufficient, it can prevent German and Italian forces from invading South America. In addition, the movement of the US fleet can also show that the US policy towards Japan is realistic. It can be seen that the threat imposed on the United States by the European situation is more urgent and important than the situation in the Far East. (Havas, 26th)

Panama: The United States has laid mines at both ends of the Panama Canal, and heavy artillery has been moved from the Pacific side to the Atlantic coast. The entire canal area is full of tension and prevention air, in view of the widespread rumors that the US fleet has departed from Hawaii to the Panama Canal, in order to be stationed on the Atlantic coast and in the Caribbean Sea, the various methods adopted above are of greater significance. A Reuters reporter asked Lieutenant General Devers, Chief of Staff of the Canal Zone, about this matter. It is said that this action is only an exercise, but it is admitted that the mines are of a live nature, and may not be removed after the exercise is completed. It is generally believed that this time the US laid mines while the Italian ship Conte Biancamano was staying inside the canal, so that the ship's personnel could not find the location of the mines laid at both ends of the canal. This matter is of great significance. (Reuters, 26th)

Panama: The Italian ship Conte Biancamano (23,255 tons), under strict surveillance by aircraft, has completely passed through the Panama Canal and is now anchored in Cristobal. (Reuters, 26th)

Washington: The Navy Department announced that the cruiser Omaha and destroyers Barry and Goff have recently sailed to Portugal, and will be transferred to the US fleet of the same strength currently stationed there. (Reuters, 26th)

### Konoe Leads Single-Party Movement

Tokyo: The movement to build a single-party system in Japan was strengthened yesterday as the three factions of the Seiyukai announced that they were prepared to dissolve their organizations and join the single party. The three factions of the Seiyukai are the Nakajima faction, that is, the Reformist faction, the Kuhara faction, that is, the Orthodox faction, and the Neutral faction, that is, the United faction. The single-party movement, led by former Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe, has now been supported by the Social Masses Party. The Minseito, Japan's largest political party, has not yet expressed its opinion on the issue, but party leaders have said that the party does not intend to take any action to prevent the organization of a single party.

### Large Number of Japanese Planes Attacked Chongqing Again Yesterday; Three Japanese Planes Shot Down by Chinese Army; Japanese Planes Dropped Bombs in Four Waves; Soviet Embassy Residence Completely Destroyed

Chongqing: Four teams of Japanese planes, a total of one hundred and twelve, again launched a large-scale attack on Chongqing today, dropping more than eight hundred bombs. The bombed area was very large, and many city streets were reduced to rubble, with broken walls everywhere. The Japanese planes invaded the airspace of Chongqing at 11:30 a.m., immediately dropping bombs and incendiary bombs. No less than five hundred bombs fell in the old-style brick city, and more than two hundred bombs also fell in the outer area of the city. The main streets were desolate, and no houses in the city were intact. Today's bombing also caused heavy losses to foreign property. The residence of the Soviet Embassy was completely destroyed, and the Canadian Church Hospital and the Canadian Church YMCA were partially damaged. The new office of the Friends Service Unit (the headquarters of which is in London) was also destroyed. The German Embassy was severely shaken, as a bomb fell only eight yards from the embassy. In addition, on the south bank of the Yangtze River, the "safe zone" designated by the Japanese, where foreigners were asked to move, also had two bombs dropped. Both bombs fell two hundred yards from the US Embassy. The US Embassy is now the only foreign embassy in Chongqing that has not been damaged. Today's bombing by Japanese planes targeted the two most densely populated areas of Chongqing. Although the damage was extremely severe, the casualties were minimal, because the air raid alarm was released very early, and the residents were able to calmly evacuate to the air raid shelters. The main roads outside Chongqing have been bombed into deep pits, and traffic has been blocked. Rescue teams and workers are stepping up their work non-stop after the air raid to repair the road surface. The bomb craters will be repaired in a few hours. (United Press, 26th)

Chongqing: More than 130 Japanese planes attacked the Chinese capital in batches again on the 26th. After the Chinese Air Force intercepted them on all sides, part of the Japanese planes were injured and retreated. The rest broke into the city's airspace at around 12 noon. The Chinese anti-aircraft artillery team immediately aimed accurately and calmly fired, shooting down three Japanese planes. The rest blindly dropped bombs and retreated. (26th)

Chongqing: One hundred and twenty Japanese planes bombed the western suburbs of Chongqing this afternoon and encountered fierce fire from Chinese anti-aircraft artillery. The Japanese planes dropped bombs in four waves.

The main building of the Soviet Embassy was almost destroyed, but the gatehouse was hit by a bomb. (Reuters, 26th)

Chongqing: Japanese planes have been attacking the city for days, not only indiscriminately bombing innocent civilians, but also deliberately bombing the embassies of third countries and foreign property, as previously reported. When attacking Chongqing today, a part of the Soviet Embassy was destroyed, and the German Embassy was also damaged. In addition, foreign properties damaged include the YMCA and the US-German Church.

### Germany Strictly Adheres to Neutrality in the Far East and Has No Ambition for Shanghai; However, Germany's Position in Shanghai is Extremely Delicate, and Foreign Nationals of Various Countries Should Not Cause Disputes.

Yesterday, a senior official of the German Consulate General in this port stated that although the European situation has changed, Germany's strictly neutral position regarding Shanghai and the Far East has not changed. The senior official said: "We do not want to attack anyone, but we are willing to replace the occasional attacks on Germany found in the newspapers of this port with news from the German communications agencies in this port. Reports in the news, such as the German Fifth Column and secret police in Shanghai, are all unfounded rumors. It is impossible to predict what will happen in the future, but at present, we certainly have no ambitions." He pointed out that the situation in this port is not controlled by local actions, but by the policies of Berlin. If orders come from Berlin, everything must be obeyed. Germany is not on another planet. Germany is fully aware of the situation in the Far East, and Germany's position in Shanghai is no less delicate than that of other belligerents. He also said that the belligerent attitude of certain aspects of Shanghai society deeply grieves the Germans. Residents of this port must know that the trend of events in Europe cannot remain unchanged in Shanghai forever. Therefore, foreign nationals of various countries in this port should not fuel unnecessary disputes with each other.

### Food Committee Recommends Taking Special Actions to Suppress Rice Prices; Investigation Confirms Sufficient Rice Reserves; Vietnamese Rice Shipments to Shanghai Continue Uninterrupted; Maritime Transportation Continues.

The English-language "North-China Daily News" reported that the Shanghai Municipal Council's Food Committee disclosed at a meeting yesterday afternoon (the 25th) that the rice reserves in the Public Concession and the French Concession are sufficient for current needs. The meeting lasted for more than one and a half hours, aiming to review the situation of rice and flour in this city and concluded that the rice reserves in the Public Concession are temporarily satisfactory. It is heard that this city has ordered several batches of foreign rice and is in discussions with the Japanese authorities to provide national rice to replenish the city's reserves, which is underway. It is reported that the Rice Committee made various recommendations at yesterday's meeting, made many decisions, and discussed the city's situation in detail. It is expected that the Committee will issue a statement to the public detailing the city's rice and flour situation. It is heard that the Municipal Council has done its best to suppress rice prices, and the overseas rice situation may also help to bring rice prices down.

Meeting Results

The "Continental Daily News" also reported that it has learned that after yesterday afternoon's meeting, the Municipal Council's Food Committee will recommend that the Public Concession authorities take special actions to suppress rice prices. As for the details of the recommendations, it was not possible to inquire from official channels. However, according to an official from the Municipal Council, the Shanghai rice situation was discussed in detail during the meeting, and recommendations were made based on the results of the discussion. The members of the Food Committee believe that the city's situation is indeed conducive to a drop in rice prices. Rice prices have already fallen by several yuan in recent days, and the most beneficial way to improve the rice situation here is that local importers and foreign trading companies have ordered a large amount of rice from Vietnam. The recent weather has also been quite favorable. The Committee believes that the rainy season has arrived and will force hoarders to release their rice because the humid weather will cause serious damage to the stored rice.

Targets of Crackdown

According to well-informed business circles in this city, whatever actions the Municipal Council takes, it should first target the hoarders who are driving up rice prices. Rumors of Vietnam banning rice exports were also spread by hoarders in order to raise rice prices. Furthermore, shipping circles here said that rice shipped from Saigon and other ports in French Indochina, and settled in Hong Kong, is expected to arrive in Shanghai in the coming days. However, according to rice merchants, unless the Japanese and puppet authorities allow national rice to be transported smoothly to Shanghai, the rice situation in this city cannot be greatly improved. Now, the transportation of rice from rice-producing areas to Shanghai is either prohibited or subjected to various exorbitant taxes before it can be transported to the concessions.

Vietnamese Rice Markets

Moreover, according to an economist's personal assessment, if maritime transportation is unimpeded, the transportation of foreign rice to Shanghai will not be a problem for three reasons: First, Vietnam's annual export volume of rice is over one million metric tons, which is extremely important to the local economy, especially in Saigon, where rice is a cash crop. If it cannot be sold, farmers will not be able to survive. Therefore, Vietnamese rice must be exported to the extent possible. Second, about one-third of Vietnamese rice exports are shipped to France, and with European markets (including Belgium and the Netherlands) blocked, Asian markets have become even more important. Third, in terms of the rice market, Vietnam's export volume is only comparable to that of Siam, and the total amount from both places is equivalent to Myanmar's export volume. If maritime transportation is not completely blocked, there will be no problem with the supply of foreign rice.

### French Concession's Increase in Water and Electricity Prices Likely Not to be Implemented; French Authorities Willing to Consider Increasing Taxes

Regarding the French Concession's Municipal Council's increase in taxes from July 1, the Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the French Concession opposed it and requested a suspension of implementation. After sending a letter requesting consideration on the 4th of this month, no official written response has been received from the French authorities to date, and the scheduled date for the tax increase is approaching rapidly. It is still to be decided whether to implement it from the 1st of next month, which is of great concern to the general public. A reporter from Dazhong News Agency learned from sources close to the French Concession authorities yesterday that the French authorities are currently dealing with all the problems caused by the European war to the Shanghai Concession, so they have no time to attend to it for the moment. It is vaguely heard that the highest authorities have expressed their willingness to consider the tax increase issue in view of the possible consequences of the increased burden on the lives of citizens. As for the Taxpayers' Association, it is eagerly awaiting a formal response from the French authorities, and the general public also hopes that this issue will be resolved as soon as possible to dispel doubts. As for the request from the French Concession Water and Electricity Company to increase prices by 40 percent from July 1, due to strong opposition from citizens and the company's excellent business performance, with substantial surpluses over the years and a very stable economic foundation, there is no need to increase prices. The Municipal Council will reject this request.

### Five Teachings Lecture Commemorating Mother's Birthday

Mr. Feng Bingnan will hold a Five Teachings Lecture at the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA from 5:30 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. from June 29 to July 3 to commemorate his mother's 70th birthday. The speakers are erudite scholars and Confucian masters. An advertisement has been placed, and it is said that all circles want to know the meaning of this event. Many people have inquired at the Feng residence, but Mr. Feng has not been able to answer them one by one. Therefore, it has been decided that Mr. Feng's fourth son, Zhenwei, and Mr. Zhang Yiqian will use the Shanghai and Cantonese dialects respectively on the New New Radio (800 kHz) at 9 p.m. on the 27th and 28th to broadcast the significance of the Five Teachings Lecture and other methods of Mr. Feng's commemoration of his mother's birthday. Mr. Feng once told people that this was originally a private matter and did not need to be publicized. However, the commemorative methods adopted are entirely for the welfare of the community and are different from the usual birthday celebrations. It is also said that on the day of the lecture, book vouchers for "An Introduction to the Five Teachings" will be distributed at the venue. Once the book is published, it can be redeemed with the voucher. In addition to giving out vouchers for "An Introduction to Taoism" on the day of the Taoism lecture, a copy of "Mirror of Moral Education" will also be given on the spot. In addition to giving out vouchers for "An Introduction to Confucianism" on the day of the Confucian lecture, Dr. Xu Xiangren will also donate hundreds of copies of "Records of Chinese Saints" on the spot.

### In Memory of Father Lebbe (Continued)

— GEC

Father Lebbe passed away yesterday from jaundice at Gele Mountain in Sichuan. The sad news has arrived, causing shock and grief, and from now on we have lost a friend who dearly loved China.

Father Lebbe, whose courtesy name was Zhensheng, claimed to be from Tianjin but was originally from Belgium. He came to China in 1910 after the Gengzi Rebellion and spent 30 years preaching in the north and south of China, enjoying great prestige. He was proficient in the Chinese language and writing, especially good at speaking. The Mandarin he spoke was absolutely indistinguishable from that of the native Banner people of Beijing, truly just as good. When he took to the stage to speak, it was like the Yangtze River pouring down for thousands of miles, not only pleasant to listen to, but truly able to move people's hearts. A university student once heard lectures by Mr. Hu Shih and Father Lebbe at Fu Jen Catholic University in Beijing and said to the writer like this: "Mr. Hu's academic lectures were pleasing to the ear, but Father Lebbe's religious truths were moving to the heart." From this, we can see the young people's admiration and respect for him.

Father Lebbe's contributions to the church and the country are well-known throughout the country, and he should be remembered for generations to come and go down in history. What we want to say now is just a few examples to illustrate Father Lebbe's words and deeds, which can serve as a model for everyone to work hard at their posts during times of national crisis, but this is really just a drop in the ocean, just to commemorate a little bit.

After the success of the Northern Expedition, until the Mukden Incident, China was in an era of popular slogans. Today we overthrow this, and tomorrow we overthrow that. On Father Lebbe's side, there was also a peculiar slogan, which was "Overthrow yourself, especially overthrow myself!" He believed that a country must attack itself before others attack it, and things must rot before insects grow on them. A country's downfall lies not in overthrowing others, but in empty talk, which is useless. We should really overthrow ourselves first, restrain all desires, such as corruption, unwillingness to sacrifice the individual, and lack of a cooperative spirit. If these problems cannot be eradicated and cleaned up, there is no point in talking about patriotism. Because patriotism is the act of sacrificing the individual to achieve the greater good. He believed that patriotism was closely linked to religious teachings. Isn't the act of teaching others without uplifting oneself contradictory to the commandment of "love your neighbor as yourself"?

When the country is in trouble, everyone should realize that there is an important distinction between words and deeds. After all, empty talk is not doing practical things. Now standing before us is a person who specializes in doing, working hard, and working hard, even to the point of Zhuge Liang's "devoting himself to the task until his dying day," knowing that it is impossible to do but still doing it. This is Father Lebbe. His ideals were lofty, seemingly difficult to achieve, but his work desperately chased and raced after the ideals, so that everything became a reality. After the end of the last European war, Father Lebbe spent six years in Europe working hard in education and serving Chinese students. He often shuttled between Paris, London, Berlin, and Brussels, working day and night. He practiced Tao Yuanming's motto of cherishing every minute, fully utilizing the time of the whole day, and he also had economic ways to use the time for resting and sleeping at night, which was to spend it on the train. So hotels and mattresses had no effect on him. Only a seat in a corner of a third-class carriage was his favorite place. There, day and night, he dozed, chanting his daily prayers. Slowly, the sky was about to dawn, and his destination had arrived. He quickly went to a nearby cathedral to offer sacrifice. He worked like this for a full six years, and six years like a day, striving every day, and being tense all the time. His relatives and friends often advised him to rest, and he said with a smile: "This is my rest, in the Lord's paradise (referring to China), that's when I'm busy! What's there to fear from temporary work? I'll rest forever in the future!" (To be continued tomorrow)

Father Lebbe's posthumous portrait

### Philippine Scholar Passing Through Shanghai Discusses American Public Opinion and the Philippine Islands' Independence; US Public Opinion Expresses Concerns About Philippine Independence; Willing to Continue Allied Operations Against Germany

Mr. Diósdado Yap, a famous Filipino economist and writer, arrived in Shanghai yesterday on the President Coolidge. This is his first visit to the Far East since he left Shanghai eighteen years ago.

The Philippines Would Be in Great Danger if Independent

Mr. Yap told a reporter from the English-language Evening American that due to the instability of the world situation, the United States is fearful about granting the Filipinos independence in 1946 as promised. American opinions on the Philippine independence issue are quite divided and can be divided into two main types: (1) those who support the Philippines' independence in 1946; (2) those who advocate that the United States retain the Philippines; and (3) those who advocate for the continued occupation of the Philippines. He also said that since Italy's participation in the war, the Philippines' foreign trade has been greatly affected. The Philippines' annual trade with various parts of the Mediterranean is substantial, but due to Italy's participation in the war, this trade has been interrupted.

Unanimous Support for Aiding Britain and France

Regarding the American impression of the European war, Mr. Yap said that the United States relies on the Allied forces to continue their operations against Germany. Most Americans believe that if the French navy were controlled by the Germans, the position of the British navy would inevitably become serious. Most people also advocate actively aiding Britain and France. Even isolationist senators such as Bloom and Vandenberg have changed their original policies when they express their views on the matter. Anti-German sentiment is even more intense in New York, Chicago, and other places. Mr. Yap has traveled to major cities throughout the United States to lecture, so he has the opportunity to conduct this kind of public opinion survey.

President Roosevelt Has Hopes for Re-election

Mr. Yap also said that Roosevelt will be re-elected to another term. Americans are also quite concerned about maintaining the status quo of the Dutch East Indies. Once the Philippines declares independence, America's trade access to the Far East will be closed, as the Philippines is America's only channel to the Dutch East Indies and Vietnam. When asked about the Philippine immigration issue, Mr. Yap said that the Philippines currently restricts the number of foreigners allowed to immigrate to only 500 each year. In the future, this restriction may be relaxed to allow more people to enter. However, this restriction is not aimed at any particular country, but because the most immigrants are Japanese, they are the most affected.

Shanghai's Prosperity is Truly Astonishing

Finally, Mr. Yap believes that Shanghai's prosperity is truly astonishing. He expressed his wish that Shanghai would accelerate its construction as a result of the Sino-Japanese war in 1937. Yap previously served as the Information Director of the Filipino Association in Washington. He is scheduled to leave Shanghai on the original ship this morning to go to Manila, where he will stay for a week and meet with President Quezon before going to Java to collect lecture materials.

### British Soldier Executed for Raping Chinese Woman, Sentenced to Two Years

Our newspaper previously received a letter from Ms. Qiu ×, who lives on Yangzhou Road in Hongkou, detailing how she was forcibly raped by a British soldier on the evening of March 26 at the Yangshupu Road Waterworks. Our newspaper inquired with the British Embassy about this matter, which was forwarded to the British military authorities to investigate the truth. Yesterday, Mr. Taylor of the British Consulate answered our reporter regarding the important points of this matter, stating that the events described in Ms. Qiu's letter to the newspaper were, except for some points that were factually incorrect, all true. As for the British soldier who defiled Ms. Qiu, he has been investigated and tried by the British military authorities and sentenced to two years of imprisonment and forced labor. Therefore, this case can be said to be closed. When the reporter asked whether the authorities had also considered the matter settled for the victim, or whether there was any compensation, the reply was that the authorities had already adjudicated the criminal lawsuit against the soldier. As for the civil suit, it would be decided based on whether the victim makes a claim.

### Directorate General of Posts Stops Relocating from Yunnan to Chongqing

According to the Shanghai Postal Administration, the Kunming Directorate General of Posts originally planned to move from Yunnan to Chongqing in order to coordinate postal services nationwide. However, due to the repeated bombing of Chongqing by Japanese aircraft, the work was quite difficult to carry out. Therefore, the plan to move to Chongqing has been abandoned, and currently the transportation in Kunming is developed, so there is no difficulty in carrying out postal services.

### Rumors of Yunnan-Vietnam Railway Interruption, But Shanghai-Vietnam Traffic Shows No Sign of Stopping; Japan Actually Announces "Surveillance" of Yunnan-Vietnam Railway

According to telegrams received from private sources in this port, railway traffic on the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway was interrupted yesterday. However, this news has not yet been confirmed by other sources. A major travel agency in this port therefore telegraphed its Haiphong branch, but had not received a reply as of last night. In addition, telegrams received by some business circles in this port from Hong Kong also lacked actual news about the current situation in Haiphong. However, banking circles in this port received a telegram from Haiphong yesterday, which did not specify the situation there, but stated that all commercial transportation in Haiphong had been completely suspended. However, at 7:30 a.m. yesterday, the Ming Sheng ship of Jardine Matheson & Co. sailed to Haiphong, and the company made no disclaimer. According to foreign sources, in order to monitor the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway transportation, the Japanese have dispatched a fleet to Haiphong and formed a monitoring committee, jointly organized by the army and navy, with 23 army members and 7 navy members as military expert members, as well as other personnel from the foreign affairs and finance departments, participating in the monitoring operations under the command of their headquarters. This matter has been announced by its naval intelligence department.

### Sunspots Disrupt Radio Waves

Since 11 p.m. the night before last, radio communications in Shanghai suddenly stopped. Some scientists believe that the reason for the interruption was due to sunspots disrupting the climate. It is said that this kind of disruption was also detected briefly on March 26, but the exact cause has not yet been determined. Some people also say that sunspots affect the reflection of radio waves, weakening them. Professor Martin in Japan said that he recently discovered six sunspots and believed that these sunspots were related, because large sunspots are enough to affect electricity and magnetism. However, the real reason is still undetermined.

### Severe Disaster in Yuyao

Hoping that this city will make every effort to raise relief funds; Shaoxing and Xiaoshan decide to purchase foreign rice.

The Yuyao Disaster Relief Fundraising Committee of Shaoxing and Xiaoshan, in order to discuss good strategies, specially convened the Second Fundraising Assembly at the meeting hall on Aierjin Road at 3 p.m. the day before yesterday. The meeting decided to actively raise funds and purchase foreign rice to transport to the countryside for relief. Many people on the spot pledged to donate. The Yarn Factory United Association also held a meeting the day before yesterday to raise funds to relieve the Shaoxing disaster.

Yuyao Suffers Severe Drought:

While rice shortages are rampant in various counties of Ningbo and Shaoxing, Yuyao County is particularly known for its drought disaster. According to the disaster victims from the county who came to Shanghai to lament their plight, Yuyao's northern region is purely dedicated to salt and cotton production. However, the southwest regions, being low-lying, are suitable for rice cultivation. In past years, the harvest was sufficient to supply the county with seven or eight months' worth of grain. This year, since the beginning of the third month of the lunar calendar, there has been a prolonged drought, causing rice seedlings in fields far from the river to be unable to be planted, totaling over 100,000 mu. Until recently, even the fields near the river have withered. Because the Yao River is far connected to the Zhenhai estuary, the prolonged drought and lack of rain have caused the saltwater tide to advance daily, turning even the available water into brine, making it impossible to irrigate. Although there was a rain once on the 7th and 8th of this month, it was insufficient to save the severely withered crops, and it was already too late.

Yuyao Cotton Hopeless:

Furthermore, regarding cotton, which is a major agricultural product, the branches and leaves are now dry and withered, so there will be no autumn harvest. Therefore, the general farmers are suffering greatly and cannot make a living. Some have committed suicide, and there have been reports of entire families starving to death because they cannot afford to exchange for rice. Currently, people in urban and rural areas have initiated a fundraising campaign for disaster relief, but the collected funds and purchased rice have already been exhausted. They eagerly hope that fellow villagers in Shanghai will have compassion and initiate a fundraising movement.

The Aftermath is Long

Furthermore, according to Shi Shufan, Zhou Weizhen, and others from the county who came to Shanghai, the Yuyao rice shortage has been alleviated somewhat thanks to the great assistance of Yu Qiaqing and fellow villagers such as Pan Jiufen. However, the drought disaster is so severe that the aftermath will be long. It is hoped that wealthy merchants who have not yet provided advances or loans will show great compassion and make unprecedented donations. In addition, it is hoped that merchants, shopkeepers, workers, and laborers will also provide assistance to the best of their ability.

### International Labour Office Maintains its Mission

Work Not Halted Due to War

The Chinese branch of the International Labour Office in this city sent a letter yesterday to various labor-management organizations and Lin Kanghou, the Chinese employer director of the Labour Office, stating that the International Labour Office had recently received a letter from the Geneva headquarters, stating that the Emergency Committee of the Governing Body had resolved that the International Labour Organisation should continue to advance its work to the extent possible in the event of an international crisis, even if the crisis unfortunately escalated into war. Therefore, at a time when the war is increasingly expanding, the International Labour Organisation is still striving to maintain its mission, and all work is proceeding as usual in Geneva and is not halted as a result. The letter was instructed to be forwarded to the Chinese government and labor-management organizations in order to relieve concerns. The bureau also separately reported to the government and notified Mr. Li Pingjie, the government director.

### Zhang Shenglian Acquitted of Charge of Disrupting a Family

Zhang Shenglian, a silk merchant from Jinhua, is 31 years old. He was introduced to Jin Wen (also known as Jing Wen), the second daughter of Zhu Xijiang, the owner of a copper shop in Sanlintang, Pudong. The two fell in love at first sight and soon cohabited at No. 34, Lane 194, Gedeng Road. Recently, for some unknown reason, Zhu's daughter suddenly disagreed with Zhang. Then, Zhu's mother, Zhu Yu, reported to the police, accusing Zhang of inducing her daughter to leave and disrupting the family. The police transferred the case to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Yesterday, Judge Chuan Lin interrogated the case. The plaintiff also brought a civil suit, requesting compensation of 10,000 yuan. According to the defendant's denial of inducing cohabitation and disrupting the family, he cohabited with Zhu's daughter with the full consent of the plaintiff, Zhu Yu, and the eldest daughter, Jin Ping, moved into the current address from the beginning. The meals and other expenses were provided by the defendant, and the maid hired was also hired by the mother from Pudong. The daughter's brother, Jin Cheng, often came to borrow money, and at the beginning of the cohabitation, the two parties also signed a cohabitation contract, in duplicate, both of which were written by the daughter's brother and signed by the mother. This time, the defendant actually demanded repayment of the loan from the daughter's brother, which caused the daughter's dissatisfaction, and she did not hesitate to falsely accuse him in order to extort money. He also presented the cohabitation agreement to the court as evidence. Under questioning, the victim confessed that the cohabitation contract was indeed written by her brother, Jin Cheng, and signed by her mother, Zhu Yu. Then, the witness, the second landlord, Lu Pan, testified that the house was rented by Zhu Jinwen first, and her brother, Jin Cheng, also lived there for a long time. The sister, Jin Ping, also lived with him, and the mother often came. When questioned, Zhu Yu also did not deny it. The court held that since the cohabitation was agreed to by the other's mother, it was deemed that there was no act of disrupting the family, and Zhang Shenglian was acquitted in court, and the incidental civil suit was dismissed.

Car Arrives on Yuyuan Road; Intercepted by Concession Police

At 10:00 a.m. on the 25th, a lodger was kidnapped from Room 631 of the Xinxin Hotel on Guizhou Road in the Public Concession and forced into a pre-arranged car that drove towards Yuyuan Road and Yiding Pan Road. The Jing'an Temple police search team intercepted the car, arrested one kidnapper, confiscated one pistol, six bullets, one pair of handcuffs, and took the driver and the victim into custody. The victim

is named Li Jifeng,

a native of Hangzhou, 34 years old, who used to work at the China Transportation Company in Hangzhou. He came to Shanghai on the 23rd of this month and stayed in Room 631 of the Xinxin Hotel. At 10:00 a.m. on the 25th, Mo Mou, a member of the "China Peace and National Construction Army" from Hongye Garden, No. 65 Yuyuan Road, and Wang Gusheng from Pudong, and a Mr. Wu, holding two pistols and one pair of handcuffs, arrived at the Xinxin Hotel in a car No. 18051 hired from the You Ning Automobile Company on Yu Qiaqing Road, under the command of "Captain" Fan.

Suspicion is High.

When questioned, Mo Mou confessed that the China Transportation Company was opened by his uncles Mo Lianqing and Mo Zheqing. Now, Mo Zheqing has absconded with 40,000 yuan of public funds from Hangzhou to Shanghai. Mo Lianqing is acquainted with "Captain" Fan, so he entrusted him to investigate. He knew that Ji Feng was a member of the China Transportation Company and knew the whereabouts of Mo Zheqing. Therefore, he obeyed the "Captain's" order to go to investigate. The court discussion was adjourned for further verification.

### Fuxin Factory Negligence Causes Huge Losses; Wheat Mill Completely Burned Down

The wheat mill on the eighth floor of the Fuxin Flour Factory No. 7, No. 102, Lane 1059, along the Suzhou River on North Chengdu Road, caught fire at 8:30 p.m. the day before yesterday (the 23rd) due to accumulated coal ash, which reignited, causing huge losses. A reporter from Pingming News Agency visited the factory manager, Wang Yao Chen (65 years old, from Wuxi, has been in office for 17 years), who said that the wheat warehouse and machine room of the factory suddenly caught fire due to the reignition of accumulated ash. Moreover, it was located on the highest eighth floor. At that time, the southeast wind was strong, and the fire could not be approached and spread very quickly. In an instant, it broke through the roof, and the existing machines and the remaining wheat were all burned to ashes, and it also affected the seven-story building. Fortunately, the fire brigades in various districts drove the water pumpers to rescue, until the fire gradually extinguished at 11 o'clock. After a detailed investigation, the losses were heavy. The repairs of the house and the assembly of the machine parts will take one or two months before the factory can reopen. The losses are estimated to be more than one million yuan. He also said that the factory's business this year is not profitable due to the limited source of wheat and the impact of high rice prices. Foreign wheat is expensive and cannot be purchased due to the shortage of foreign exchange. Now, this accidental fire is even more difficult. During the "January 28th" battle, the eighth floor of the factory also caught fire, but the losses were small. Therefore, this negligence is the second time.

### United Cup Charity Basketball Group List Approved and Announced; A Total of Fourteen Teams are Admitted and Divided into Two Groups for Championships; Strength is Distributed Equally and There Will Be Fierce Competition

The United Cup Charity Basketball League has been so crowded with applicants that the office authorities have had to change their original intention to accommodate so many teams. In the first competition committee meeting the night before, it was decided to divide the teams into two groups. However, in order to make the competition more exciting, the committee reviewed and selected six teams with more equal strength to form one group, and another group with equal strength was named Group A1 and Group A2, so that the difference in strength would not be too great in the future. However, because there are fewer teams in Group A1, it was decided to adopt a double round-robin system. Because there are more teams in Group A2 and the time is limited, a single round-robin system had to be adopted. The championships are also distinguished into two. The committee must clarify that the purpose of this competition is completely for charity, so the competition strives to be exciting. At the same time, the grouping has been carefully screened and there is no discrimination at first. Some teams could not be selected due to time and venue constraints. The committee is very sorry. The competition is now scheduled to begin on the 29th of this month (Saturday).

Later, Hong Kong Telecom sold British gold and Chinese merchants sold US exchange. Chinese banks such as Guohua also bought in. The meeting saw a softness of 3-5 84375. The US dollar broke into 6 yuan to 5 yuan and 9375. After 9:30, peace rumors arose again.

Finally, British gold was 3-5 875, and US dollars were 6 yuan 03125, British tight 0625, US long 03125. The half-day trading of British currency was scarce and strong. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon.

The banks opened spot selling prices in the morning. British gold was 3-5 90625 and the US exchange rate was 6 yuan, compared to the evening close of the previous day. British currency was soft 0625 and the US dollar had no honor or disgrace. It was due to the rise in exchange rates. After the opening, speculators sold and foreign banks also supplied a lot, so the banks absorbed it and the market remained flat. It is estimated that the Chinese banks Guohua and speculators bought US exchange for 5 yuan and 9375 in July (20,000 US dollars). Also, Huayi bought US exchange from foreign banks in the same month for 5 yuan and 96875. The HSBC listing announced that the British was flat and the US was long. The silver balance tax was announced without any increase or decrease. After this, Hong Kong Telecom came to buy in and the general Chinese banks followed suit. The Chinese maintained it with the US banks, so although it was tight, it was also slight. It is estimated that Hong Kong Telecom bought British gold for 3-5 875 and 84375 from foreign banks in July. Also, Chinese banks Yu Cheng and others bought US exchange from US banks in the same month for 5 yuan and 875. The current US exchange rate is 5 yuan and 9375 and the advance is 3-5 84375. At 9:45, speculators suddenly sold in unison. Hong Kong Telecom also turned from buying to selling. The market turned from tight to loose for a while. It is estimated that the Chinese banks sold US exchange to Datong for 5 yuan and 96875 in June. Also, speculators and Hong Kong Telecom sold US exchange for 6 yuan to 6 yuan and 03125 to foreign banks in June, and it did 5 yuan and 9375 in July. However, the spot price of British gold was still 3-5 875, and the loose trend was slower. As a result, British gold was 3-5 875 (there are still 890625), and US exchange was 6 yuan 03125. In July, British gold was 3-5 84375, and US exchange was 5 yuan and 9375. Compared with the evening close of the previous day, spot British currency was tight 09375 and US currency was long 03125, and in July, British currency was flat and US currency was loose 03125.

The Shanghai exchange rate fell by 2 yuan and 75 jiao, to 114 yuan. The "Lianchao" dark market was cheap 75 jiao, to 99 yuan and 5 jiao.

### Foreign Currency Rises, Exchange Rates Uncertain

Yesterday's foreign currency market situation, cash rose and fell, and British and American gold pounds also rose and fell first, and finally fell by 1 yuan. The British gold ticket remained unchanged. The US gold ticket initially rose to 16 yuan and 86 jiao, and then gradually fell. The evening market was 16 yuan and 57 jiao, down 1 jiao and 3 fen from the previous day. The demand for Hong Kong tickets was quite strong, only rising by 6 fen. There was no shortage of supply of Canadian tickets and Philippine tickets, and the market prices were consistently weak. The supply and demand of Japanese gold tickets and Korean tickets were balanced, and the market prices were stable. The former was still 1 yuan and 9 and a half fen, and the latter was still 9 jiao and 7 and a half fen. It was also heard that HSBC had stopped listing the French exchange rate, so the money exchange industry also stopped buying and selling French franc tickets.

### Gold Market Changes Three Times a Day

Yesterday's cash market situation, after falling, it rose, and after rising, it finally returned, with a large difference in ups and downs. People felt more uneasy about the market. There were both bullish and bearish news, and buying and selling were both controlled. Looking at the overall process, it opened at the most tired level in the morning at 5,510 yuan, and soon fell to 5,450 yuan. This was because the silver houses sold a large amount. Later, the foreign exchange reported tightness, stimulating buying. It once rose to 5,610 yuan. The Zhongjin Silver House absorbed very strongly, but a certain gold house and securities firm Qian Duiye and others took advantage of the high price to sell, selling as little as 5,460 yuan. As a result, it closed at 5,500 yuan, down 35 yuan from the previous day. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon, and the half-day turnover was about 2,000 taels or more. The jewelry gold shop listed 10 yuan less, and the customs gold remained flat.

Cash Fell by 35 Yuan

Since the morning, each bar (10 taels), initially because the exchange market was slightly strong, when it opened, people were scattered and unmotivated, and it immediately fell by 25 yuan. Qian Duiye did 10 taels to each other, at 5,510 yuan. Then, because of the fierce sale by Qian Duiye and the silver house, it fell by 60 yuan again. The silver house sold 50 taels to the gold house, and it was lower than 5,450 yuan. Then, because foreign reports published some bullish news in China, the foreign exchange rate turned tight, and the cash house first came to buy in, followed by gold houses, jewelry shops, and silver houses, which rose by 160 yuan. The silver house entered the jewelry shop for 10 taels, rising to 5,610 yuan. After this, a certain gold house sold high and closed positions, and sold more than 200 taels, so the high price was difficult to hold, and it immediately fell by 20-30 yuan. Unexpectedly, at that time, there were various domestic and foreign news in the market, and the exchange market fell back. Securities firms, cash houses, and Qian Duiye successively sold, and generally profitable bulls also sold at limited prices, so it fell by 100 yuan again. Qian Duiye sold 20 taels to the gold house, at 5,480 yuan. Later, the selling subsided slightly, and a certain Qian Duiye slightly dragged in, pulling up 40 yuan. The silver house did 10 taels to each other, at 5,520 yuan. At noon, securities firms came to sell again, and cash houses still sold, and it fell by 60 yuan again. Securities firms sold 20 taels to silver houses, at 5,460 yuan. Near the close, Qian Duiye and retail investors bought in, raising 40 yuan. The silver house sold 30 taels to Qian Duiye, at 5,500 yuan as the afternoon closing price. As a result, it was 35 yuan less than the previous day, with a half-day increase of 160 yuan. The selling price of the cash house's own brand gold was 10 yuan higher than cash, and the purchase price was reduced by 30 yuan. The current standard gold was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there was little trading.

Jewelry Gold Sells 10 Yuan Less

The selling price of jewelry gold per tael in the silver house was still 570 yuan at first, but it was reduced by 10 yuan at 11:15. There were no changes after this. As a result, Datong Bank changed the price to 560 yuan, and the new bank had the same price as the previous price, and the purchase price was reduced by about 30 yuan.

### Securities: Domestic Debt is More Stagnant, Stock Market Turnover is Also Slow

The dark market for securities, yesterday's trading, was even more stagnant. The market has clearly formed a situation where there are more sellers and fewer buyers. Although there are very few people absorbing, the sellers do not reduce the selling price because of this. For example, the Oriental Credit Bank, which has been selling for days, is noteworthy, but it is also unwilling to lower the market price, because it is a spot outflow, which is completely different from speculators. However, its sale is not easy. Although news is still constantly attacking, there are no alarming facts. The scope of the nuclear surface is shrinking day by day, and it will not lead to turmoil for a while. However, we must pay attention to the evolution of the future. Yesterday morning, No. 4 sold more, and Runli also had many late hands. Jiufeng bought in, and Xie Dahong recovered slightly. In the afternoon, Jiu continued to buy in, and Yonggeng sold again. As a result, except for Type D, which had no turnover, the market price was exactly the same as the previous day. There was absolutely no difference. The turnover was about 300,000 yuan. A simple table is listed below.

Stock trading, 50 shares of China Bank shares were traded, the price was 73 yuan and 5 jiao including interest.

Also, the Shanghai Public Utilities Stock Exchange was slightly active, and the trend was softer than before. There were not many transactions, and the market situation was in a state of turmoil, with no special characteristics.

London, 25th (Tuesday) telegram, today's listed prices of British Far East companies, bank stocks fell again, Macarthy Bank shares fell 2 shillings and 6 pence, to 6 pounds 2 shillings and 6 pence, HSBC Bank's British registered shares fell 5 pounds, the price was 60 pounds, Hong Kong registered shares fell 3 pounds, the price was 65 pounds, the rest remained unchanged.

London, 25th (Tuesday) telegram, today's listed prices of Chinese foreign debt remained stable, and the upper and lower bonds had no changes.

### Food: Rice Prices Loosen

Yesterday's rice market was tight first and then tired. Since the sharp drop in the previous dynasty, the morning market was able to attract the attention of rural households and shops on this street. The Zhejiang gang, which had been suspended for two days in the interior, also started to sell, and the situation was tight. Speculators immediately used their functions. For a time, they held each other, and the prices of various foreign rice rose repeatedly, suddenly increasing by 1 or 2 yuan. No. 1 Chen Saigon had reached 64 yuan, No. 2 had 61 yuan and 3 jiao, Huo Jiao had 63 yuan, and Xiao Jiao had 60 yuan and 8 jiao. Later, the general sales saw that the prices were high, and the intention was light, and many stood by. The inland gang also collected a small amount after the implementation of the passport system, and stopped one after another, causing speculators to sell one after another. The market turned sharply downwards. In addition, large profit-making households and floating households took advantage of the high price to return, and the incoming households also had a light appetite because the source of foreign rice was uninterrupted, and there were still 30,000 bags of a ship to arrive. By the afternoon opening, the hoarding households continued to sell, and the actual sales were stagnant. The market fell by nearly 1 yuan. Xiao Jiao's early market was 60 yuan and 5 jiao, and the afternoon opening price was as low as 59 yuan. Then, the rumor spread in the market that there was a conflict between the British and Japanese troops near Hong Kong, and people were aroused again. Xiao Jiao's evening closing price was as high as 60 yuan and 5 jiao. Other rice also followed suit and revolved. The original Saigon spot was 75 yuan and a half to 76 yuan and 3 jiao, and the No. 2 Siamese rice was 18 yuan, 68 yuan to 67 yuan and 2 jiao, and the month-end shipment was 66 yuan and a half. The transaction was more than 300 tons, and the new transaction was not settled. The current foreign rice transaction was 6,800 bags.

The arrival of glutinous rice is limited, but the sales market is sluggish and affected by foreign rice. The market is flat and the prices are depreciated by half a yuan. Jin Liyuan's special yuan is 59 yuan and a half, 59 yuan, Changdan Baiyuan is 57-8 yuan, and Jiangbei goods are 56 yuan.

National rice such as thick and thin japonica rice, because of the increase in rainfall, the evening harvest is promising, and the people in the producing area have stabilized. The price of brown rice has frequently fallen. The arrivals of the combined transport ships have been prosperous. There were no less than 2,000 or 3,000 bags yesterday. Therefore, rumors spread that the dark market outside the market was tired of foreign rice, and the selling heart was quite loose. At the same time, the way out has also turned lax, and the selling price has continued to drop by Yuan Xu. Changbang's special Qing japonica rice is around 73 yuan, and Su Kun's Changzhou white japonica rice is 71-2 yuan. Those who decide to stay hot are 67-8 yuan, Qing Si's thin rice is 71-2 yuan, and it will be 68 yuan if it is decided. Nangang's early rice is 66-7 yuan.

### Factory Powder Continues to Rise by 4 Jiao, Japanese Factories Continuously Collect Wheat

The No. 2 flour mill's price yesterday increased from 14 yuan and 3 jiao to 14 yuan and 7 jiao, an increase of 4 jiao compared to before. After the factories held a meeting a few days ago, they released prices to buy new wheat on the one hand, and supplied real sales on this street as much as possible. However, the cost of new wheat that is about to arrive is difficult to be too cheap, and the needs of this street are increasing day by day, so it is decided to increase the price again. As for the guest gang hoarding households, they continue to stop selling. Yesterday, the number of batches issued by each factory was about 13-4 thousand bags. It is heard that the Japanese flour Phoenix brand futures continue to be sold off, and the price for July and August must be 16 yuan and 6 jiao. The transaction was about 2-30,000 bags. 1,500 bags of flour will be shipped to Hong Kong on the 27th.

There is no news about new wheat transactions from Chinese factories. Japanese factories continue to collect wheat, mostly from Kunshan and Jiading near. However, the price of wheat has been low, because of the continuous rain these days, the production price has dropped sharply, with a difference of 1 to 2 yuan, so the collection and transportation permit can be issued, and the wheat market will soon be crowded.

### Yarn and Cotton: Manufacturers Take Back Warehouse Receipts, Yarn Prices Still Difficult to Increase

The yarn market is stagnant and has no characteristics, but the actual transactions are extremely slow. This is because the South China Sea is unstable, and Japanese warships travel back and forth, which makes business uneasy, so the Hong Kong gang's purchase is tied and they are mostly waiting for the opportunity to move. However, in order to maintain the market, Shenxin Factory has collected 500 bales of 20-count Double Horse warehouse receipts, and the limit price is 950 yuan, but the market price has not been raised.

The opening of the current yarn market has no special highlights. The price of 20-count Double Horse is 952 yuan, a slight increase to 960 yuan. It has fluctuated greatly, and most of the vendors are selling because the actual needs of the Hong Kong gang are not strong. However, the foreign exchange rate has changed, and the price of gold has risen, but the cotton yarn market has not been able to move upwards. In addition, Shenxin's purchase is particularly smooth, probably due to the financial relationship at the end of the month. The closing price is 951 yuan. The statistics of transactions in half a day are 1,900 bales, and the price of 20-count Double Horse has fallen by 9 yuan. 190 pieces of yarn will be shipped to Hong Kong today. The amount purchased by each gang is listed on the left:

Fellow Traders: 1,780, Inland: 30, Hong Kong: 90, Total: 1,900

### Cotton Market Declines Daily

The current situation of cotton is declining day by day, and the trend is very weak. Transactions in all parties have stopped. This is because yarn sales are clear, but the market price is unstable. Manufacturers have no intention of raw materials. Moreover, the end of the month is approaching, and the money market is tight. Generally, households with urgent needs are selling cotton at reduced prices, so the market price is declining step by step. If there are occasional transactions, the market price is quite low. Dazhongji only sold 175 yuan. The current cotton price list is listed on the left.

Tongzhou Flower: 155.00 Fellow Traders Enter 300 Bales, Dazhongji 175.00 Another 330 Bales

In addition, the market price of foreign cotton, the New York cotton market, was very quiet in the early morning, and the cotton price fell slightly by 1 or 2 pounds. Afterwards, due to the fatigue of Wall Street, some bulls closed out, and the Southern gang sold short in the market. As a result, the closing price fell by more than 20 pounds compared to the previous day. The Indian cotton market, including forecasts, also fell by 9 rupees.

The foreign cotton trade in Shanghai was extremely quiet, and the industry heard that those who urgently needed softness were selling at sharp discounts, but few people were interested, and the transaction became a dead market. However, yesterday's yarn prices were still relatively stable, which is a good phenomenon in the cotton market.

### Miscellaneous Grains: Bean Cake Price Rises, Soybeans Remain Firm

Soybeans rose by more than half a yuan again, because the bean cake trade was booming. More than 30,000 pieces of various cakes were sold by inland and Nanyang firms yesterday, and the price jumped by 4 or 5 jiao. Therefore, the base is very firm. Yesterday, the oil extraction factory took 500 bags of Qingdao beans, the price was 29 yuan, 3 cars of Bengbu beans, 28 yuan, 600 bags of Dingjiazhou beans, 28 yuan to 27 yuan and 5 jiao, 300 bags of Wuhu beans, 27 yuan and 8 jiao, 200 bags of Anqing beans, 28 yuan and 2 jiao, 200 bags of Chongming sand yellow, 27 yuan, and 50 yuan of Pudong Du beans in this street, 27 yuan and 7 jiao.

395 pieces of soybeans arrived from Tianjin on the 26th, and were exported on the 27th. 400 bags were transported to Hong Kong, and 600 bags were transported to Singapore. 7,000 pieces of bean cake were transported to Hong Kong on the 27th, and 4,950 pieces of raw oil were transported to Hong Kong. There were also 315 bags of sesame, which were transported to Singapore today.

### Coal: Bituminous Coal Slackens and Roads are Clear

Due to the recent prosperous arrival of various coke goods and the weakening of the way out, the trade is affected by the oversupply, and the color cannot be reduced. The shops on this street are cutting prices. It is estimated that the price of Indian Calcutta coke is 230 yuan per ton, the price of Kaiping No. 1 coke is 180 yuan, and the price of Keelung coke is 150 yuan. The price of coke below the body of bituminous coal is 140 yuan, and other miscellaneous coke is also generally small.

### Sugar Market: Raw White Slightly Up

Yesterday, the sugar market trended flat and soft, with fluctuations observed. The Public Association set the盘 (price or trading range). Spot prices for 24-grade raw white sugar: from the local warehouse (本棧) at 69 yuan, from outside warehouses (外棧) at 68 yuan 7 jiao to 6 jiao, up 1 or 2 jiao. Re-export goods were traded at 54 yuan 7 jiao for immediate warehousing. For delivery on July 2nd, prices were 55 yuan 2 jiao to 3 jiao, up 5 jiao. Taikoo’s (太古) "Car White" (車白) continued up a slight 5 jiao, "B Mack" (B麥) at 79 yuan 5 jiao, "HX Mack" (HX嘜) at 77 yuan 5 jiao, "H Mack Car Red" (H嘜車赤) at 57 yuan 5 jiao, Dutch Red (荷赤) at 59 yuan 3 jiao 4 or 5 fen, up 2 jiao. Local factory snow white (雪白) at 69 yuan, No. 1 ice (冰) at 91 yuan, Crystal Clear Ice (晶明冰) at 92 yuan 5 jiao, up a slight 5 jiao. National sugar (國糖) only had Guangbang (廣帮) opening with a few boxes of next-grade 青念(qingnian), at 44 yuan 5 jiao.

### The Decline of China's Silk Industry

— Yi Zhi

However, the second stage of "control" is now about to descend. But it will not strike directly, but rather obliquely. That is, it will use political power to block the export of products from small silk factories, making it impossible for small silk factories to circulate their finances and thus achieve automatic cessation, or transformation into production work for the "control," that is, reeling silk products. The only way out is to sell to it, making small silk factories its appendages, becoming one of its production facilities. This will achieve its aim of completing the "control of the entire silk industry."

The fate of small silk factories is bleak (the fate of large silk factories is about to end). There are no cheap goods or shortcuts to the true revival of China's silk industry. The development of China's national industry is bound to come after the victory of national liberation. Without the latter, there will be no former. It is just like flowers and fruits, which cannot be indifferent. Whoever pays the price for national liberation will reap the corresponding harvest. Taking chances and speculating cannot accomplish great things. (End)

### New Sea Mouth Branches of North-South Goods: First Batch En Route

The first batch of new Sea Mouth Branches (新海口枝): According to电 (telegram), 装慶元 (Zhuang Qingyuan) is shipping them and they are en route. It is expected that they will arrive today. Because there are signs of collection of payments (款收) everywhere, and the market inventory is lacking, the initial price will inevitably be relatively high. Approximately, the 水東 (Shuidong) branches will be in the range of 80 yuan.

### Daylily Tightening

The daylily (金針菜) market is tightening due to the collection of payments for new goods. The previous price rose from 42 yuan to 45 yuan. Yesterday, more than ten packages of 高大興 (Gao Da Xing) daylily were opened, with a relatively bright yellow color. The price was raised again to 48 yuan, a further increase of 3 yuan. The market is expected to continue to rise.

### Flying Head: High-Grade White Serge Scarce and Sought After; Stock of Thick Serge Also Low; Plain Colors Expensive and Sales Slow

White Serge: High-grade, over 30 yuan per yard, is mostly Western goods. The amount stored in the market is limited, so the market remains strong. Ordinary and lower-grade goods, around 20 yuan, are mostly local Shanghai factory goods and Eastern goods. The market turned weak yesterday.

Thick Serge: Navy blue is relatively stiff, and yuan-colored (元鬃色) is slightly softer. Recently, Shanghai inventory has been critically short, so the standards are all quoted high by sellers. Western goods, English Indigo (英地果) colors, are very few. Shanghai factory goods, such as British Jardine Matheson's (怡和) No. 55 and 39, Xie Xin, Yin Feng, etc., are also mostly scarce and firm.

Plain Serge: Factories have been continuously increasing prices due to raw material shortages. However, since the price increase, sales at retail stores have decreased significantly, so most wholesalers are promoting their existing inventory and have no new purchases. Buyer demand is mostly for 革 green (ge green) with slight批 (batch), yuan-colored thin Serge. Only transactions of ten or eight yards. The刻所 (carved character brand) sold for 15 yuan per yard, previously only sold for 4 yuan or so.

Exports: Today, there are 92 pieces of cotton cloth being shipped to Hong Kong, and another 72 pieces being shipped to Singapore.

### Metals: Black Iron Billets Sales Slow, Price Returns

Black Iron Billets: Transactions have felt quite quiet recently. Because local hot water bottle factories, mirror factories, printing factories, and food can factories, etc., have seen these expensive prices, they have all reduced their purchases sharply, transactions are becoming rare, and market conditions have also become deserted. People's hearts are wilting, so industry peers are纷纷 (one after another) slightly reducing prices to save this declining trend. The current market price is about 1,000 yuan per bundle, a decrease of 20 or 30 yuan compared to before. It is said that the current overseas cost is as high as 1,200 yuan, so newly arrived goods should be at a loss. This is caused by the high water freight and the sharp increase in pricing, two factors together. Although the source of刻時 (carved character brand) has not been exhausted, there is already a feeling of unprecedented difficulty.

### Qingfeng Ridge

During the time of Emperor Duanzong of the Song Dynasty, bandits captured Taizhou. A civilian's wife, named Wang, possessed a captivating beauty. A chiliarch (千夫長) abducted her, killing her parents-in-law and husband, forcing her to go with him. The woman, fearing defilement, deceived him, saying, "You must allow me to mourn for my parents-in-law and husband for a full month before it is possible." The chiliarch moved her. When the army returned, he took her away. When they reached Qingfeng Ridge, overlooking a bottomless chasm, the woman saw that the guards were slightly negligent. She looked up to the sky and sighed, "I have found my place of death!" Immediately, she pricked her finger and wrote a poem on the stone wall, then threw herself off the cliff to her death. The words on the stone remained perpetually fresh, untouched by wind or rain. The officials built a temple for her and inscribed her story on a monument, renaming the ridge from "Qingfeng" (靑楓) "Maple of Purity" to "Qingfeng" (淸風) "Purity of Wind." Yang Lianfu (楊廉夫) passed by this place and wrote a poem: "The horse carried her for hundreds of miles, on Qingfeng Ridge blood-written words were formed; only Liu Ruan’s (劉阮) Peach Blossom Stream (桃花水) could be as 清 (clear), not like 巴陵 (Baling)’s Han River (漢水) 清 (clear)." From then on, his life was full of hardships and he had no children. One night, he dreamed of a woman who said to him, "Do you remember writing a poem about Lady Wang? Although it did not harm her chastity, it defamed righteousness (義), and your heart was deeply刻 (cut/mean). Therefore, heaven has cut off your descendants and blocked your success." Lianfu awoke, greatly regretting! He wrote another poem: "Heaven follows earth, the concubine follows the soldier, heaven and earth are heartless, but the concubine has affection. Finger blood opens the red sky, moss traces transform into a clear snowy river. I wish to die in the sound of the Xiang zither, not live in the beat of the barbarian flute. The cuckoo cries blood in March, the autumn wind writes mournful inscriptions without tears." Later, he passed the imperial examinations and had children. This shows that the pen has a sword, and one should restrain its sharp edge.

### National Hero Zhang Huangyan

— Qin Ge

The banner of righteousness raged for twenty years, who knew the fate of the maiden's seat lay in (blank)!

The Tong River (桐江) vainly ties the raft of Yan Guang (嚴光), the Lei Marsh (雷澤) cannot bring back the boat of Fan Li (范蠡).

Living, like a feather, still harms the country; dying, leaving blue blood to support the sky!

Loyalty is the affair of the lone minister, who hopes for eternal 青 history to record!

With country broken and home destroyed, where to go? By West Lake is my teacher.

The sun and moon hang doubly over the tomb of the Zi clan, half the world is the ancestral hall of the Yue family.

Ashamed to use bare hands to divide three seats, daring to borrow a branch with a red heart.

One day, a plain carriage will travel the Eastern Zhejiang road, why must the angry waves all be sea gulls and barbarians?

Why does the lone minister's intention rest the opportunity? The Lu Ge (魯戈) cannot pull back the slanting sun.

Arriving late in life, ashamed of pine and cypress, leaving here, smiling at Wei Wei (薇).

Double hair is difficult to容 (contain) the journey of the Five Mountains, a sail still heads towards the Ten Continents.

Wen Tianxiang (文天祥) died late, the river and mountains wept, let future history be right or wrong!

From the above three poems of righteous indignation by Zhang Huangyan, we see the spirit of a firm and outstanding national hero of ancient times. It makes us feel that although the late Ming Dynasty was destroyed by rebellious ministers and internal thieves, countless sons and daughters who were unwilling to be slaves finally raised the torch of resistance under the enemy's iron hooves. Although they failed, the blood and flesh of the sacrificed finally created the immortal national soul of China. "Loyalty is the affair of the lone minister, who hopes for eternal 青 history to record!" The descendants of China will forever sing these great verses, verses containing blood and tears!

Zhang Huangyan was a national hero who stood tall during the period of the invasion of foreign tribes in the late Ming Dynasty. His life was entirely a bloody struggle, occupying a magnificent page in national history. Unfortunately, because there are too few accounts, for three hundred years, the historical traces of this perfect generation have been too neglected. He does not have the widespread fame of Shi Kefa (史可法) or Wen Tianxiang, but "who hopes for eternal 青 history to record," this extraordinary ambition, how can it be attained by heroes of past dynasties?

Zhang Huangyan was from Yin County, Zhejiang Province, with the courtesy name Yuanzhu, also known as Cangshui. He was a juren (舉人) in the late Ming Dynasty. Since his youth, he deeply hated the court's internal ministers who harmed the country. He often gathered with friends to discuss national affairs, with a sense of singing and crying at the same time. When the Qing army invaded Yangzhou to the south, Zhang Huangyan rose up to serve the country, uniting with Qian Sule (錢肅樂), an official from the Ministry of Justice who firmly defended Ningbo, to welcome Prince Lu as the regent to continue the Ming Dynasty. At the same time, he called on the people of Zhejiang Province to jointly resist the enemy. At that time, people with lofty ideals from all over the area rushed to Zhang's banner. Therefore, Zhang Huangyan's kingly army invigorated the decadent psychology of the people at that time and maintained a corner of the remnant situation of the Ming Dynasty in Jiangnan.

At that time, Zhang led a brigade of soldiers to resist the tiger-wolf army of the Tatar cavalry. The outcome of success or failure could not be reversed by human effort. Zhang tasted endless hardships and difficulties. He shared difficulties and joys with thousands of warriors, so that the warriors did not surrender or yield in the extremely dangerous battlefield, and generously gave their lives to the nation.

After the defeat of the war, Zhang, with an unyielding spirit, personally protected Prince Lu to Nanao, wanting to rebuild the foundation there. At the same time, he united with Zhang Mingzhen's (張名振) volunteer army, using Zhoushan as a base, and jointly attacked Wusong, planning to restore Jiangnan in one fell swoop. However, contrary to expectations, the strong enemy destroyed Zhang's base - Zhoushan. Zhang Huangyan had to escort Prince Lu to Xiamen, relying on Zheng Chenggong (鄭成功) to continue the sacred anti-Qing war of restoration.

After Zheng Chenggong and Zhang Huangyan cooperated, there were excellent reforms in military affairs. Zhang Huangyan worked hard day and night for the crisis of the motherland, training a brave and good-fighting iron army. At the same time, he stepped up the adjustment of Zheng Chenggong's original navy. As a result, the land and water armies cultivated strength and waited for an opportunity. Finally, the banner of righteousness was raised again, and the allied forces attacked Zhejiang, recovered Yangshan, entered Zhenjiang, and directly attacked Jinling, creating the foundation for the restoration of the country. At that time, Zhang Huangyan and Zheng Chenggong wept bitterly and paid tribute in front of the Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum, vowing to restore the land and expel the foreign tribes!

However, under the strong counterattack of the Manchu soldiers, the long-term bloody battle made the strength of the volunteer army start to shake again. Zheng Chenggong was defeated by Liang Huafeng's (梁化鳳) troops, and Zhang still fought a desperate battle with the Qing army with a small isolated army, until almost all of his subordinates were killed or wounded. Zhang himself was seriously injured before escaping to eastern Zhejiang, re-training his soldiers, and preparing to rise again. His unyielding spirit truly demonstrated that the Chinese nation will always be strong and never perish!

At that time, Manchu Qing officials, because Zhang firmly resisted the Qing army, repeatedly tried to persuade him to surrender, using fame and fortune to lure him, but Zhang Huangyan firmly refused. In his letter to Lang Tingzuo (郎廷佐), the governor of the two Jiangs, Zhang said: "I painfully hate the barbarian atmosphere. With one shout, armor and shields stood like mountains. My humble ambition is to show the spirit of your lord if I succeed, and to preserve the integrity of my minister if I fail. Therefore, I do not hesitate to step into the midst of winds and waves, and纵横 (criss-cross) under the edge of swords, to this day, I will die. The common hatred is gradually widening, and the late節 (jie/segment) is becoming more firm. Training troops in the coastal corner is precisely to take advantage of the time..." He was not discouraged, only determined, without compromise, only fighting, truly a typical national hero!

However, surrounded by enemy traitors, he was finally arrested. A generation of loyal ministers was publicly executed in Hangzhou. He generously went to justice, sacrificing his life to achieve benevolence, and preserving the eternal glory of our nation!

"Let future history be right or wrong," only history cannot be concealed. Who are the martyrs who defended the country, and who are the dogs who betrayed the country, the descendants will see clearly!

### Sowing

— Lei Xing

Have you ever seen the fields in the countryside, the light and graceful姿態 (attitude) of golden wheat? With gentle waves and charming摇曳 (swaying), they capture the eyes of passersby. Beyond the fields are wildflowers. They all wave to you like old friends.

The joy of life adorns the motherland's fields and warms your heart.

However, their predecessors were just tiny seeds; can you imagine it? But it is not a dream or a miracle. The seeds sprout, grow, and thrive, eventually bearing fruit.

You should recognize the power of seeds.

So, be a diligent and坚毅 (resolute) sower. What is urgently needed on this land are the seeds of struggle. You must preach fairness, justice, and freedom.

Look: the sparks of revenge flying all over the sky are not the harvest of our predecessors?

Hawthorne's Detective Work

### The Whereabouts of the Dance Queen

— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter Two: "A Page from the Past"

Jinmei glanced at the deceased again and began to say: "Miss Wang went out at about half past six yesterday evening—"

Hawthorne suddenly cut her off and asked: "Did she go out alone?"

"No, Manager Lu came to pick her up again in a car."

"Again? So, does this Manager Lu come to pick her up every day?"

Jinmei hesitated about this. "Although not every day, there are always five or six times in ten days."

Hawthorne had already lit a cigarette and nodded. "Go on."

Jinmei continued: "I don't know when Miss Wang came back after she went out. I served Old Master - Master Li to eat dinner, and then I ate dinner with Wu Ma. After eating dinner, I went upstairs because I had a newly made skirt sleeve that was too long, and I went to modify it myself."

Hawthorne also asked: "What was the situation downstairs when you went upstairs?"

"Master Li was reading the newspaper in this reception room. Wu Ma was washing dishes in the kitchen. Lao Mao went out to see a play without eating dinner."

Hawthorne's eyes flashed, he puffed out a puff of smoke, and asked slightly surprisingly: "See a play? What play?"

"I heard it was a (blank) play. I wasn't very careful."

"Okay, what time did you go upstairs?"

"It was at half past eight. After I went upstairs, I never came downstairs again. It took more than an hour to finish that shirt. At that time, I was a little tired, so I went to bed. Not long after I went to bed, I hadn't fallen asleep yet, and I heard Master Li also go into his room. Afterwards, I slept very soundly, until after midnight, when I was awakened by a gunshot. The gunshot was heard in the middle of the night, and it was very loud, so I couldn't help but immediately jump out of bed—"

Hawthorne interjected again: "Did you only hear one gunshot? Or were there other sounds, such as shouting, etc.?"

Jinmei hesitated and replied: "No. After I was awakened by the gunshot, I didn't hear it a second time, and there were no other sounds. But I can't say whether there were other gunshots before I woke up." (27)

Military Affairs

### New Weapons

— Ya Zuo

Since the outbreak of the European War in early May, the newspapers have constantly reported on Germany's rapid tactics, saying that it uses a large number of newly invented weapons to break through the Allied forces' solid defenses. However, in the Soviet-Finnish War that ended in mid-February this year, the Soviet Union also used a variety of new weapons. Recently, Finland displayed several types that were captured for people to refer to. The famous ones include strange bombs used on airplanes. Their structure is a cylinder-shaped object about the size of a person, containing sixty bombs the size of thermos bottles; the tail of the cylinder-shaped object is equipped with leaf plates. When dropped, it can rotate by itself, causing the outer casing to automatically fall off, so that the internal bombs can be scattered by the rotation force, spreading sixty bombs onto the target object. Such a package of bombs can destroy a town due to its wide distribution. The Finns gave it a humorous name, called "Molotov Bread Basket." When it flew down from the air, the Finns assumed: Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov sent a basket of bread.

There are also landmines buried by airplanes, that is, a small parachute is hung on ordinary landmines, so that it gradually falls on the ground. However, this weapon is suitable for use in places with ice and snow, because after being dropped from an airplane, it can be buried by the blank (snow?) on the ground, so it is not easy to be discovered by the other party. If it is exposed on the outside, it is very easy for people to detect.

There is also a flamethrower tank, which the Soviet Union had already used during the Soviet-Finnish War; although its power is terrible, it must be used in close combat to attack fortresses built of reinforced concrete, using extremely high heat to destroy things hidden in the defenses, which is indeed very effective.

### Shirley Temple—Formally Leaves the Silver Screen

— Xin Fang

Regarding Shirley Temple's departure from the silver screen, this magazine has repeatedly described it. According to reliable sources, the previous rumors were still unofficial news; at the beginning of last month, when Shirley completed her twenty-fourth new work "The Young People," Shirley's mother, George Temple, and Joseph M. Schenck, the general manager of 20th Century Fox Film Company, jointly announced to all sectors that Shirley had formally retired from her silver screen career.

This little star has been working on the silver screen for a full seven years now. During this period, she held the throne of world movie star for four years (1935-1938), until last year when she dropped to third place; Shirley's annual gains are rapidly increasing in commercial royalties obtained outside of movies; although there is no detailed estimate to date, it has recently been revealed that she has earned at least 20 million yuan for the film company.

This month, the 20th Century Fox authorities are preparing to pay her 30,000 yuan; this fee is entirely to reward her for her usual loyalty to the company during her work. Mr. Schenck is very hopeful that she can return to the silver screen, he said: "In my opinion, if she returns to the silver screen one day, her achievements will be as brilliant as in her childhood."

Shirley Temple's mother is a well-known virtuous and talented person in Hollywood; she is in charge of all the trivial matters of her daughter. Regarding her daughter's departure from the film industry, she made the following statement: "In the future, she can experience another kind of life, which she has never found in her life. Secondly, I can guarantee that if she is away from the entanglement of the photography field and lives among a group of children of the same age as her, her talent will undoubtedly be easier to develop."

Shirley Temple is now going to school; it is reported that this issue is fully responsible by the California Bureau of Education. Recently, several of the most ideal teachers are being sought.

Shirley Temple has temporarily said goodbye to us on the silver screen, but it is possible that after a considerable period of time, she may change her appearance and meet us again; so all the audiences who usually love her can now be sure that they don't have to be too disappointed.

### Chen Juanjuan Recounts Her Wandering Life

— Kui Zhang

Child star Chen Juanjuan has long returned to Shanghai and is about to star in "China's Snow White." Yesterday, a reporter passed by her house and went in to talk to her about her wandering life in Annam and Siam. No newspapers or magazines have published it, so the reporter briefly recorded Juanjuan's oral wandering life below.

She said: "After Xinhua filmed "Xiao Xiang Night Rain," the "August 13th" war broke out, and I left for Hong Kong with my婆婆 (grandmother) on December 7th, 1937. While in Hong Kong, I was invited by Yang Yinquan of the Plum Blossom Troupe to guest star in a play for four days. After the performance, I went to Guangzhou to organize the Juanjuan Traveling Troupe to perform national defense dramas. In April 1938, I performed in Guangzhou for the second time. I performed for seven days in a New Star Theater, and then I went to Taishan to perform in the Taiping Theater, and then to Jiangmen to perform in the Jiangmen Theater. I remember that the last time I was in (blank) Prefecture was in the Zhonghua Theater performing "Autumn Sun" and "Little Sanzi," which were quite a sensation."

"On August 11th, I set off to Annam, and still performed national defense dramas in the Chinese Theater in Ti An. At the same time, I still used the name of Juanjuan Traveling Troupe, and then my father performed in the Zhongshan Theater in My Tho and the Chinese Theater in Saigon. After performing in various places, I went to Siam, and still performed in the same way. I performed in the Queen's Grand Theater for a month, and in the National Grand Theater for half a month."

"Originally, we were still planning to go to Singapore, but later we were blocked by the outbreak of the European War. So we detoured to Annam and went all the way to Shanghai. It has been three years since I left Shanghai in an instant."

### Xu Qin Fang Returns to Shanghai for Funeral—Lu Ming Stays in Hong Kong to Film "Liu Yingchun"

— Tai Gong

Lu Ming's father passed away on the 21st due to illness. Then rumors spread that Lu Ming would return to Shanghai for the funeral. In fact, Lu Ming did not return to Shanghai, but Xu Qinfang did return to Shanghai from Hong Kong on the 23rd.

Yesterday, the reporter met Qinfang, who said that Lu Ming was originally prepared to return to Shanghai to take care of his father's funeral, but recently, the filming of the film "Liu Yingchun" by Nanyue Company was very intense and could not be stopped, so the company firmly persuaded him to stay.

As for Qinfang's coming to Shanghai, the company specially finished filming all her scenes in "Liu Yingchun" the day before she set off, so she was able to come to Shanghai, but when she arrived on the 23rd, her father's funeral had already been taken care of by Zhang Shankun, Hu Xinling, Fan Xuepeng, Bao Xiaodie and others. Now she has sent a letter to Chen Kengran and Lu Ming, telling them everything, and at the same time asking them to take a month's leave to return to Shanghai for the funeral. At the latest, they can return to Shanghai after "Liu Yingchun" is finished filming.

### From Singing to Peking Opera (Part 2)

— Xiaotian

Kunqu opera lyrics are so refined, and pronunciation so accurate, one would think they would be universally appreciated. Yet, some say that Kunqu is like a "sleepy tune," and listening to a few excerpts inevitably leads to slumber. Speaking for myself, I have even studied several Kunqu plays, but recalling the dozens of Kunqu operas I have heard in my life, only one or two excerpts have truly captivated me. I believe there are two main reasons for this. First, Kunqu lyrics sometimes strive too much for elegance, thus becoming obscure and abstruse. Those who have not devoted themselves to poetry, lyrics, and prose often cannot understand them upon hearing, and even if they are given the script to read, they may stumble over broken sentences. Moreover, if the performers themselves do not deeply understand the meaning of the lyrics, how can you expect them to convey the true intentions of the playwright? Second, there is a lack of talent in the Kunqu opera world. This is easy to understand. For example, we say that "Si Lang Visits His Mother" is a good play, which one never tires of hearing. But if famous actors like Tan Xinpei, Mei Lanfang, Chen Delin, and Gong Yunfu perform it, it is indeed a pleasure to hear repeatedly. However, if a motley crew of mediocre actors perform it, it would be difficult to bear. Let's use accounting as an analogy. The creation of an accounting system is one issue, and the precision and skill of the bookkeepers are another. However, if the system is well-designed, it can reduce or easily detect errors made by the bookkeepers. Conversely, if the bookkeepers have sufficient accounting knowledge, they can also discover the shortcomings of the system and make more complete corrections. The two can complement each other.

Now we can boldly say that the shortcoming of Kunqu opera in terms of lyrics is that it is too profound. On the one hand, it is not easy to find suitable talent to perform it, and on the other hand, it cannot be popularized. Although the lyrics of Peking Opera seem more vulgar, it does not have the above two difficulties. If we aim for something popular but not vulgar, Kunqu is too refined, while Peking Opera falls short. However, it is easier to revise Peking Opera. Only in terms of pronunciation, as mentioned above, regarding the four tones, Kunqu has already arranged them properly when setting the music, so the singer does not need to worry about them. Peking Opera is different. Whether it is Xipi or Erhuang, as long as the transitions and resolutions do not violate the rules, the singer must arrange the other words and melodies themselves. How many ordinary actors have studied phonetics? Is it not difficult for them to avoid singing the wrong tones? Let's not talk about others. Even the esteemed Sun Juxian and Wang Yaoqing, two veteran performers, one sings with a Tianjin accent and the other speaks with a Beijing accent. It is even more difficult to blame others. However, I have a personal opinion: if the pronunciation of a word is inherently incorrect in the old melodies, then it should be forgiven. But if the melody is changed because of the word, and the original word was not incorrect, but the change makes it incorrect, then it must be corrected. I am not just making empty arguments; it is simply that there are too many people who think they are clever these days.
