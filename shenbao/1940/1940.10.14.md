Washington - Secretary of State Hull, while hosting news reporters yesterday, stated that as soon as two American giant ships, the Washington and the Manhattan, are inspected and ready for service, they will be dispatched to the Far East to transport American nationals. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)

Washington - Secretary of State Hull announced yesterday that the two large liners "Manhattan" and "Washington" are currently being prepared to urgently sail to the Far East to facilitate the evacuation of American nationals from China, Japan, Hong Kong, and Vietnam. News from New York indicates that the "Washington" has received orders to sail to Shanghai on Thursday. Officials of the U.S. Mail Steamship Company declined to comment on the order for the ship's preparation for sailing. This order was received late last night from Washington. The General Manager of the U.S. Mail Steamship Company is currently in Washington conferring with U.S. Customs officials. The United States will prepare sufficient tonnage of ships in the Pacific to handle the evacuation of American nationals from the Far East. These American nationals will swiftly evacuate according to the State Department's "recommendation." The "Washington" will depart on Thursday; if workers can quickly add seating in the ship's large cabins, it may depart earlier. Customs officials declared yesterday that they are in negotiations with the U.S. Mail Steamship Company to utilize the largest liners in case of emergencies to evacuate American nationals from the Far East. Shipping circles indicate that the recently completed "America" ship could be used in emergencies. During periods of extreme tension, U.S. Navy and Army transport ships can also assist with evacuation matters. (Taiwan Public Telegraph, 13th)

Washington - A non-official authority here, the "Army and Navy Journal," carried a report yesterday stating that the United States may expand its embargo against Japan within the month and order U.S. warships to Singapore to take parallel action with Britain in reopening the Burma Road. The report stated, "The next ten days will be a crucial period for determining the extent to which the war will spread and whether the United States will move closer to war." The report stated that when Britain reopens the Burma Road on October 17, the United States will reaffirm its support for Britain's action. According to the report, this declaration may be made in a new form that goes beyond official documents, "It is highly possible that it will be done by sending U.S. warships to Singapore or expanding the embargo against Japan." Observers point out that the newspaper's commentary on the Far East coincides with the State Department's announcement that two giant U.S. liners will be dispatched to the East within the week to expedite the evacuation of nationals. General developments over the past week have strongly reinforced the view among people here that the administration is planning to take stronger steps in the Far East. (United Press dispatch, 13th)

### U.S. Military Aid to Britain Cannot Be Prevented by Other Nations; Roosevelt's Columbus Day Speech

Dayton, Ohio - President Roosevelt delivered today one of the strongest-worded speeches of his life. Roosevelt declared in his speech that the Allied nations in Europe and Asia cannot prevent the United States from aiding Britain, which is fighting to the death with the Axis powers. The President's speech was broadcast via radio to the entire United States and the twenty sister republics of the Western Hemisphere. Roosevelt said during the broadcast, "The United States does not want to fight with any nation," but the reason for its full armament on both oceans is that recent history shows that the promises of dictatorships in Europe and Asia are worthless. At the same time, Roosevelt directly stated that no country or group intends to prevent the United States from aiding Britain. Roosevelt's resolute speech is one of the strongest speeches he has made in his long political career. Roosevelt's speech was delivered from a temporary studio in the dining car of the presidential train, which has just concluded its tour of defense facilities in Pennsylvania and Ohio and arrived here today. President Roosevelt resolutely defended the government's "gradually drawing us into the war" policy. (International Telegram, 13th)

The President added, "We are determined to aid the last free nation in the world. The dictators of Europe and Asia, even if they unite, cannot change America's intention. Britain is actively fighting, keeping the dictatorships beyond the gulf." Roosevelt also stated that the U.S. rearmament program is for the defense of the United States, "and to cooperate with the democratic nations of the Americas to defend the Western Hemisphere. An unprecedented crisis has prompted the United States to build a stronger naval and air force to protect American seaports and resist any combined enemy." The President added that the United States has obtained eight new naval and air bases in the Western Hemisphere from Britain, which "is not only to protect America itself." According to the President, "The reason why the United States obtained these bases is to protect the entire Western Hemisphere, and all the democratic nations of the Americas can jointly use them." Roosevelt also endorsed America's intention to continue to "traditionally use the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans peacefully."

Columbus - President Roosevelt received a 21-gun salute yesterday on Columbus Day when he visited local manufacturing plants and steel mills here. The factories visited by the President are all participating in the national rearmament movement. When the President arrived, thousands of local residents crowded the streets adorned with national flags, cheering loudly and watching the presidential motorcade pass by. Later, the President gave a speech, the main point of which was to urge the public to accelerate the production of defense materials. The President said, "The best way to avoid being attacked is to be prepared to accept attacks from others at any time. Therefore, steel manufacturers once told the workers in the factory, 'Our other requirement for rapidly increasing production is to further increase speed. The faster, the better. I especially declare this intention to you. You must accelerate as much as you can within your ability.'" The President told reporters in his special train heading here yesterday morning that the United States could avoid being drawn into a widespread war vortex, but the President demanded that the rearmament program be completed as soon as possible to make the United States unbreakable. The President also said that he felt it was difficult to maintain a non-belligerent position in a world at war, but he declared boldly that he believed the United States would be able to avoid participating in the war. Columbus residents enthusiastically celebrated yesterday under the President's leadership, with parades and speeches everywhere. All shops and markets were closed. Most states and counties were officially closed for holidays. In New York City, no fewer than thousands of people participated in the grand parade, including garrison troops and various social, political, and patriotic organizations.

Washington - The non-official authority, "Army and Navy Journal," carried a report here yesterday stating that the United States has no intention of avoiding its responsibility to defend the Philippine Islands in the event of war in the Pacific. Although the newspaper is privately run, it usually reflects the opinions of senior government officials on the government's defense policy. The newspaper said that the United States' guarantee to defend the Philippines has been "repeatedly stated in Manila, London, and elsewhere." The newspaper stated, "High Commissioner of the Philippines, Mr. Sayre, publicly declared in Manila this week that the United States is preparing for events in the Far East, which has broad implications. If the people of the Philippines mobilize for training, the United States will provide munitions and training facilities at the request of recent Philippine officials." The newspaper continued, stating that the U.S. plan to defend the Philippines does not mean that the United States will cancel other important regional defense plans, "Washington's attention to Philippine development has been unprecedented in recent years." (United Press dispatch, 13th)

Deploy Mobile Anti-Aircraft Artillery Units Along the Coast

Washington - It was learned here today that the United States, learning from the lessons of the European war, has abandoned the suggestion of surrounding its densely populated cities with fixed anti-aircraft artillery units and will rely on powerful and rapid mobile units. The National Defense Commission, on the advice of anti-aircraft artillery strategists of the Army Department, is now allocating huge sums to purchase equipment for mobile units. This equipment can shoot down aircraft at altitudes of over 20,000 feet. The Army Department's research on air-raid shelters has been completed and will be announced next week. Several major coastal cities need to build air-raid shelters. It was learned from international sources that several senior officials, during secret presentations before the Congressional Committee, have convinced congressional leaders that enemy aircraft attacking the United States will be limited to a few hundred due to the protection of the vast oceans. In the event of an air raid on the United States, mobile units can immediately rush to the threatened city upon receiving the alarm. However, officials refused to disclose what kind of air defense equipment exists or what equipment has been ordered. Military experts are currently drafting plans to establish naval and air bases in Newfoundland, Bermuda, British Guiana, Antigua, Trinidad, the Bahamas, Jamaica, and Saint Lucia. Reliable sources claim that President Roosevelt will request Congress to allocate $600 million to build and improve these bases in the Pacific. (International Telegram, 13th)

### U.S. Military Equipment - Ambitious Plan

Washington - It was learned here today that although the U.S. Army Department's plan has not been formally announced, defense army leaders have accepted the following procedures: (1) The current military strength of the Defense Army will increase to approximately 400,000 by January 1 of next year. (2) Each division will include 14,000 soldiers. (3) Four more divisions will be added by October 15, and further increases will continue by December 15. (4) All soldiers will be equipped with various new weapons currently being manufactured, and then they will undergo the largest field exercises. (5) Then, the soldiers will take on garrison duties as part of the regular army duties. If an accident occurs, the peacetime military strength of 14,000 men per division can be increased to a wartime military strength of 19,000 men per division. The U.S. government has ordered four full divisions to enlist, consisting of four infantry regiments, three artillery, engineering, medical, and quartermaster regiments. Garrison camp sites are under construction, with barracks and training grounds that can accommodate more than double the current number of national defense troops already enlisted. The troops are trained according to wartime military strength, not peacetime military strength. General military leaders generally believe that after this group of soldiers has undergone training camp, they will be transferred to the nearest base to Britain, Panama, Cuba, Alaska, Puerto Rico and other island nations.

Editorial

### Wishing Thailand Self-Respect

Ten days ago, Japanese articles expressed a threatening tone towards the opening of the Burma Road, saying that if Britain reopened the road, it would inevitably lead to the outbreak of a world war. Now, the imminent opening of the road has become a fait accompli because of the offensive Japan has taken against Britain and the United States. As for whether a world war will break out immediately as a result, the negative answer has been obtained in the recent attitude of the Japanese authorities. Therefore, the Chongqing side had speculated that if Japan had no countermeasures, the current cabinet would inevitably fall. This view still held that the Japanese authorities would inevitably take some kind of countermeasures, whether for the sake of interest or face. The easiest thing to do would be the bombings that the Japanese side has already publicly declared. In addition, according to news from Vichy yesterday, it was rumored that the Japanese side would use Thailand to create "disturbances" before the road opened, and use Thailand as a base for attacking the Yunnan-Burma Road traffic. The Thai authorities also expressed an intention to cooperate with the Tripartite Pact. After Japan occupied northern Vietnam, its second goal for southward expansion was none other than Thailand. If at this time it could use the pretext of disrupting the Yunnan-Burma Road to seize bases in Thailand and bring Thailand into its fold, nothing could be better. What is incomprehensible is why the Thai authorities would willingly be used by others? When France and Japan were negotiating the Vietnam issue, Thailand also took the opportunity to demand land from Vietnam, causing disturbances for many days, and recently ended temporarily with the organization of a mixed delegation. In Thailand, this has already formed an objective accomplice, but it is not without reason to recover lost territory. As for the aforementioned rumors, it is tantamount to using the nation's fortune as a lone bet to engage in a major international gambling adventure.

The extent to which Thailand will help Japan still needs to be proven by the facts, but it can be asserted that its importance lies not in China but in British Burma. Because Thailand and China do not border each other, and the airports in Thailand are farther from Yunnan Province than Hanoi and Lao Cai, Japan cannot obtain any convenience from Siamese territory for invading Yunnan Province. On the other hand, if it is used to spy on British bases, Thailand has significant value. Rangoon, the capital of Burma, is not far from the Thai-Burma border, and is most susceptible to threats from Thai territory. At the same time, the Kra Isthmus is a vital threat to the east coast of the Indian Ocean, and the southern end of the Siamese peninsula directly threatens the back of the Malay Peninsula, which can make the Singapore fortress face enemies on both sides. If the status quo is changed by force, it will naturally not be tolerated or tolerated by Britain or even the United States. On the Thai side, at what cost or conditions would it lightly throw itself into a dangerous international vortex, and would not hesitate to abandon its long-standing policy of neutrality and side with Japan to become an enemy of Britain and the United States, is a huge question.

Thailand is the only remaining independent country in South Asia, and its years of striving to move upstream have also been sympathized with by the world. However, since the military took power, it has lacked vision and firm views, and has been blindly seeking immediate gains and admiring the strong and bullying the weak. It has sought to attach itself to aggressive countries, and has frequently slandered neighboring countries struggling to survive. Although its diplomatic policy seems to be operating in many ways, it is secretly based on relations with Japan and even Germany and Italy. This situation has painted a bleak prospect for Thailand's future. Therefore, the current rumors of participating in the Tripartite Pact and even acting as a scapegoat for aggressors are not impossible. Its recent threat to demand territory by taking advantage of France and Vietnam's danger has been widely recognized as unjust. If it further deeply integrates with the axis of aggression, its intentions can hardly be understood by ordinary people. The United States' note to Thailand to maintain the status quo and restrict the transportation of military supplies to Thailand has provided an initial warning: if it increasingly reverses course, it will inevitably encounter greater international pressure. Moreover, Thailand is situated between two major powers. Relatively speaking, the pressure from British India and Burma is more direct and imminent. Even if Japan has obtained bases in northern Vietnam, it may not be able to provide effective support to Thailand other than pursuing its own expansionist ambitions. As for Germany and Italy to Thailand, they are even beyond their reach. In this way, if it wants to hastily form an alliance with a country that cannot be waited for, offending a strong neighbor nearby, it is feared that it will be even more detrimental than beneficial for both Britain and Japan to join the Tripartite Pact, but from Thailand's own situation, it is obviously more clumsy than Japan.

In this increasingly acute international confrontation, the only way for small countries to protect themselves is to be firm and calm, to uphold justice and not be biased. Even if they encounter adversity, they do not worry about having nothing to survive, such as Switzerland, which is a clear example. If it does not measure its virtue and strength, and rashly thinks of attaching itself to a powerful beam and sharing the leftovers, and the country it regards as its ally is even a country that has always been known for disregarding faith, this is no different from treading on thin ice and treading on a tiger's tail. It is an extremely foolish adventure. As Poland and Romania have lacked firm views on their foreign policies and have been deeply associated with aggressors, they have finally fallen into a situation of being unable to recover. These lessons are all worth learning from Thailand today.

From the common standpoint of small nations, Thailand has no relationship. If from the common standpoint of Eastern small nations, Thailand should not be afraid to support the opening of the Yunnan-Burma Road, because China's interests are also the common interests of Eastern small nations, and Thailand cannot exclude itself from this. If the current Thai authorities still lack this kind of understanding and awareness, then at the very least, it is hoped that they can turn their attention from those who are concerned about the Yunnan-Burma Road to the future of their own national destiny.

### The U.S. Presidential Election Situation Gradually Becomes Tense, Willkie Gains Many Votes in the East

Washington: According to the most recent surveys, the upcoming presidential election will depend on undecided voters in three or four pivotal states. The votes of one state could decide the outcome of a race that has been close for years, but the final three weeks of the race could also overturn the current situation. President Roosevelt, in his bid for a third term, is in a favorable position, but Republican candidate Willkie has made great gains in the last three weeks, especially in the East. Democrats are secretly concerned about Pennsylvania, Illinois, New York, and Massachusetts, as their votes in the election will reach 119, accounting for one-quarter of the 531 total votes cast in the last election. All political observers in the United States believe that the election may be decided in the last few days, and it is generally expected that there will be surprising moves, and it is expected that there will be many split tickets at that time. (13th International News Agency dispatch)

The pamphlet also pointed out that Hitler said that black people are not as good as apes and that France is stained with black people's blood and should be destroyed. Therefore, Willkie had engaged in anti-black activities in Elwood City in Japan. (13th United Press dispatch)

### Demonstrations Held in Various Parts of Japan to Celebrate the Tripartite Pact, Matsuoka Speaks at Public Assembly

Tokyo: Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka spoke to more than 50,000 people at Hibiya Park yesterday at a rally celebrating the establishment of the Tripartite Alliance between Germany, Italy, and Japan. He said that he believed Germany and Italy would win, but if the war situation was unfavorable to Germany and Italy, Japan would help them. Matsuoka also admitted that Japan was willing to make peace with China as soon as possible, but this peace should be an honorable peace. Matsuoka said, "We are willing to reach peace as soon as possible, but this peace must be an honorable peace. If the Japanese people are tired of the China Incident, then they are not suitable to be the people under the principle of "Eight Corners under One Roof," and the days to come for our country, I dare to say, may be limited." Matsuoka also said, "I think Germany and Italy will win this war, but if the war situation is unfavorable to them, Japan should be prepared to help them. We should be prepared to fight alongside Germany and Italy. I don't care whether the Japanese people agree with this alliance, because I think Germany and Italy will win." Matsuoka said that Japan's conclusion of this alliance was because Germany and Italy recognized the principle on which Japan had built its country for 2,600 years, that is, "Eight Corners under One Roof," which means "One World Family." Matsuoka also said that the alliance between Germany, Italy, and Japan welcomes any other country that agrees with the spirit of "Eight Corners under One Roof," but we will resolutely exclude any country that hinders the spirit of "Eight Corners under One Roof." Matsuoka then pointed out that Japan's past foreign policy was too weak, saying that since Germany and Italy withdrew from the League of Nations, these three countries should cooperate with each other. He also said that the alliance between Germany, Italy, and Japan was established for peace, to prevent neutral countries from participating in the European War and the Sino-Japanese War, and to ensure that every country has its proper place. Matsuoka also emphasized that the alliance signatories had decided not to engage in combat with any country that attacked Germany, Italy, or Japan. Matsuoka then read to the public a speech by Prime Minister Konoe, which emphasized that the Tripartite Pact was the driving force for building a new order in Europe and Asia for the purpose of world peace. Matsuoka read this article because Prime Minister Konoe was suffering from a slight illness and could not attend the speech in person. Konoe's article also stated that Japan was facing a critical turning point, and therefore the government had taken a decision to build a new national structure. German Ambassador to Japan Ott and Italian Ambassador Indelli also gave speeches to celebrate Japan's alliance with Germany and Italy. (13th United Press dispatch)

### Preliminary Control of the Balkans, German Troops Invade Romania Becomes a Reality, Turkey Issues Strong Warning to the Axis Powers, Two Million Soldiers Ready to Resist Aggression, Turkish Ambassador to the Soviet Union Returns to His Post to Discuss How to Deal with the Situation

London: A Reuters diplomatic correspondent said that the situation in the Balkans is gradually becoming clearer. The invasion of Romania by German troops is beyond doubt and has now been confirmed by official circles. This development at least shows Germany's policy, which is a preliminary step in controlling the Balkan Peninsula, or a sign of abandoning the plan to invade Britain this year. It will not be a matter of a day or two for Germany to occupy the entire territory of Romania, but it will take several weeks to complete. After that, it will deal with the problems of Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and Greece. However, these three countries are not as easy to deal with as Romania. Germany will probably ask Yugoslavia to allow its troops to pass through with a sad and beautiful plea, and will promise Bulgaria Greek territory in the Aegean Sea. However, according to newspaper reports, Bulgaria, regardless of Italy's pressure, has refused Italy's bribe. The Bulgarian government maintains a correct and friendly relationship with the Southern and Hellenic countries, and its attitude towards Turkey is also very firm. Therefore, the propaganda of Germany and Italy has not made any progress in Bulgaria. Although the situation may change after the German army occupies Romania, there are still forces that are unfavorable to the Axis powers, such as the attitude of the Soviet Union, which is enough to influence the situation. At the same time, Turkey also issued a strong statement, expressing its attitude, which cannot be ignored by the Axis powers. This statement reflects the official opinion, warning Germany that 2 million Turkish soldiers stand on the way to the Bosphorus Strait and the Middle East. Turkey is not only bound by the British treaty, but also wants to fulfill its obligations. Turkey's remarks can be said to be a timely warning. (13th Reuters dispatch)

Ankara: Turkish Prime Minister Saydam had a long discussion with Soviet Ambassador Vinogradov yesterday. The content of the talks was not revealed by officials, but it is believed that they must have studied the possible consequences of the Axis invasion of the Balkans. (13th United Press dispatch)

Moscow: Dr. Akita, the Turkish Ambassador to the Soviet Union, returned to Moscow last night after resting in Ankara for two months. At this time, just when the Axis powers and the Soviet Union are about to be in conflict due to Germany's "bloodless" invasion of the Balkans, it is believed here that the Ambassador's return to Moscow is an attempt to form a united front with the Soviet Union to deal with Germany's southward advance from the Balkans and the threat of the country's invasion of Greece and Yugoslavia. (13th United Press dispatch)

London: Well-informed sources here said last night that Ambassador Akita suddenly returned to Moscow from Ankara and was about to seek the Soviet Union's attitude towards the Axis powers' invasion of the Balkans. Reliable sources also said that Akita carried instructions to inquire about the Soviet Union's policy on Turkey's armed assistance to Greece. The British believe that in the current situation, the Soviet Union will not interfere with Turkey, but it is believed that the Soviet Union will guarantee Turkey that if Turkey decides to assist Greece, the Red Army will not attack Turkish territory. As for the entry of German troops into Romania, it is deeply believed here that Mr. Akita will also ask the Soviet Union to express its attitude in his talks in the Soviet Union. (13th United Press dispatch)

Istanbul: Although Turkish people have seen the lurking threat of the German army's occupation of Romania, they do not want to worry unnecessarily before clarifying the strength of this occupied army. According to Ankara's opinion, the Soviet Union should be more concerned about this Nazi action than Turkey. Germany may be worried about the uncertainty of the Soviet Union's policy, so it preemptively acted to prevent the Red Army from invading Romania and losing the oil production needed for British military affairs.

### Assisting in Training the Romanian Army: German General Staff Arrives in Bucharest. Led by Hansen Speidel. 20,000 German Troops Arrive Continuously in Romania.

Bucharest: According to the local gazette, the first batch of German troops dispatched to train the Romanian army arrived here yesterday, fully equipped. Accompanying them were a corps commander and several officers from the German General Staff. Romanian Prime Minister Antonescu welcomed them, and official circles referred to them as a military mission. There are thirty high-ranking officers, led by General Hansen, who previously led the large-scale invasion of the Netherlands, along with three major generals and eleven colonels. The Romanian Chief of Staff greeted them at the Bucharest train station, and the head of the Iron Guard, the Romanian Foreign Minister, as well as the ambassadors and military attachés of Germany, Italy, Japan, and Spain, also came to welcome them. It is estimated that 20,000 German troops have already arrived in various parts of Romania. Columns of troop trains are visibly passing through Hungarian territory, and many ships are also arriving at ports along the Danube River. Recently, twenty German air force officers, led by Lieutenant General Speidel, also landed at a military airfield outside Bucharest by plane. In the past few days, German pilots and technicians have been arriving in Romania. The Romanian people learned of the German troops' entry into Romanian territory from the gazette published in yesterday's newspapers. On Friday, the Iron Guard fired hundreds of pistol shots at the garden of the residence rented by British military officers, with bullets raining down, hitting the walls, and shattering glass. The bullets came from the neighboring yard. The adjacent house was formerly the residence of Mrs. Lupescu, the mistress of Romanian King Carol. Although the British immediately protested to the Romanian authorities, the Romanian authorities did not stop it, and the Iron Guard continued to fire for a while before stopping. Fortunately, no one was injured. (Reuter's dispatch from the 13th)

German Troops Arrive in Bucharest: Romania Extends a Warm Welcome

German and Romanian flags were hung high at the station, and a guard of honor paid their respects at the station. The military band played the national anthems of Germany and Romania. General Ion Antonescu delivered a welcome speech on behalf of General Antonescu, saying, "The cooperation between the German and Romanian armies at this historically important time gives us great hope for the future. Romania and its army have long admired German military technology, so they are extremely eager to cooperate with Germany. Now that our wish has been fulfilled, we will sincerely establish a firm relationship." The German military delegation replied, "We are extremely grateful for the warm welcome we have received from the Romanian army and people along the way. It has laid a good foundation for future cooperation." The German military delegation and the welcoming party then traveled by car to Kiseleff Avenue in Bucharest, where the public cheered and paid their respects along the way. The cars then drove to the square in front of the Royal Palace, where they were surrounded by the welcoming public, creating a very enthusiastic scene. (Haitong dispatch from the 13th)

To enhance the friendship between the two countries, Germany has agreed to Romania's request and sent a military delegation to come. The first group, led by General Hansen and General Speidel, arrived yesterday. When the delegation passed through Outer Transylvania, the residents there gave them a warm welcome. (Haitong dispatch from the 13th)

London: Official news agencies in Berlin and Rome simultaneously released explanations from the Axis powers today regarding Germany's entry into Romania. According to the German official news agency, the Romanian people must feel secure in order to engage in social and economic construction in an atmosphere of peace and tranquility. The entry of German troops into Romania is a symbol of German guarantees. They will provide the Romanian army with their acquired experience in technological warfare and assist Romanian Prime Minister Antonescu in building a strong Romanian army. The Italian news agency stated that Romania must consider the possibility of its oil-producing regions being bombed. The normal production of Romanian oil is important for the Axis powers' war effort and Romania's economic life. The entry of German troops into Romania is the result of a complete compromise between Romania and the Axis powers. (Reuter's dispatch from the 13th)

### Fierce German Air Offensive: London Continues to Suffer Devastating Bombing. Famous Nunnery Completely Destroyed by Fire. 5,000 Engineers Assist in Cleanup Work.

London: London sounded its 200th air raid alarm since the beginning of the war yesterday. There were five alarms during the day yesterday. Enemy planes attempted to sneak into London, but they were intercepted by central "Hurricane" and "Spitfire" fighter planes near the southeast coast. The two sides engaged in fierce combat in the clouds. One or two enemy planes broke through the encirclement and randomly dropped bombs. Civilian houses and shops suffered some damage, and several people were killed or injured. However, within minutes of the bombs falling, the area returned to normal. Six bombs fell on a town on the southeast coast, but only one bomb hit a hotel, causing no casualties. Several bombs also fell on the town of Hastings. On Friday night, a girls' convent was also a target of enemy bombing. The convent buildings were a century old. The enemy planes first dropped incendiary bombs, followed by two large bombs. The head of the convent, disregarding the danger, led the nuns to climb onto the roof to put out the fire with fire extinguishers, but all the buildings were eventually burned down or bombed. The valuable library and many famous paintings were destroyed in the fire. The roof of the church was also affected. Fortunately, none of the nuns were injured. After Friday night, the London area was frequently alarmed the next day. According to the gazette, several locations in the London area were bombed from high altitude by enemy planes on Saturday morning. Several bombs also fell in the areas of Kent and Sussex. There was not much loss of life or property. It is now known that four enemy planes have been shot down, and one British plane has also been lost, but the pilot is safe. On Sunday, 5,000 engineers will begin clearing the streets in the London area that have been attacked, starting with the east and southeast, as those areas have suffered the most damage. During the cleanup, 500 trucks will be used. Intact bricks, tiles, and usable timber will be used to build refugee shelters and repair houses. As for the private belongings found in the rubble, they will be preserved by local authorities for the original owners to claim. Useless debris will be used to fill holes or dumped into the sea.

### Soviet Red Army Changes Training Methods: Combat Exercises Underway

Moscow: The Truth Daily commented that the current exercises of the Red Army and Navy are still in progress. This exercise shows the efforts of the Red Army and Navy to enhance their strength. The Second Imperialist War, in which the world's largest capitalist countries participated, has given us new insights in military technology. The Red Army is the most well-prepared army in the world. In order to maintain this position, the Red Army should carefully study the experience of this war. Based on the experience of recent battles, the Red Army has greatly changed its military training methods. Attention should be paid to the joint actions of infantry, artillery, tanks, and the air force. Artillery should first destroy the enemy's defenses, and then tanks and infantry should advance. In short, all training should be based on realistic wartime scenarios and comply with wartime operations. This is a special feature of the Red Army's exercises in 1940. In the future, the authorities will definitely train Red Army personnel based on this point. The current exercises are about to end, but winter war exercises will continue, so that the needs of modern warfare can become the basis for military training. (Telegraph from the 13th)

### Former U.S. Army Chief of Staff Advocates Timely Aid to Britain: Telegram to Aid Britain Committee

Manila: Former U.S. Army Chief of Staff and current Philippine military advisor, General MacArthur, recently sent a telegram to Mr. White of the American Keep America Out of War Committee, stating that the issue of whether you will continue to aid Britain and safeguard civilization has come to us. To solicit my opinion, I can summarize the history of military failures in two words: missing the moment. Knowing the enemy's poisonous schemes and the nation's crisis too late, preparing for war, uniting for resistance, and providing aid to allies too late are all reasons for defeat. Victory in war is not mysterious; it all lies in gathering superior military force in a timely manner. The secret of victors in history lies in careful planning to subdue the enemy. The Axis powers have repeatedly been victorious in this war, and their way lies in this. If the United States does not understand the importance of timing and allows history to record the United States missing the moment again, it would be the biggest strategic mistake. The aid that our country's leaders deem appropriate should be carried out at the same time as Britain's efforts, so that the English-speaking people of the world will not be divided in the slightest. If each exerts its strength and unites with each other, the weaknesses of being alone will naturally disappear. The time cannot be lost; do not leave behind the grief of being too late. Start planning today; do not wait for tomorrow. (Reuter's dispatch from the 13th)

### U.S. Consulate Will Continue to Issue Notices: Urging Women and Children to Evacuate First. Japanese Residents in This City Feel Extremely Uneasy. The United States Should Expand Economic Sanctions.

In order to defuse the Japanese threat, the United States, in addition to conducting close cooperation with the British Navy and strengthening its Far East fleet, and to prevent possible incidents in the Far East, has ordered the evacuation of American men and American women and children in the Far East who have no tasks or professions. The families of the U.S. Navy in Shanghai and North China are also included in the evacuation. According to what was learned by a reporter from the Ping Ming News Agency from relevant sources in the U.S. Navy yesterday, the families of important U.S. Naval military officers in this city, such as Mrs. Baker, the wife of Colonel Baker, the commander of the Shanghai garrison, are scheduled to leave Shanghai and return to the United States on the U.S. Mail Steamship Company's President Coolidge on the seventh of next month.

Second Notice To Be Issued Within Days

After the U.S. Consulate in this city issued a notice last week urging American men and women and children with no tasks to evacuate, American residents living in the Hongkou area have registered with the U.S. Consulate, determined to evacuate. It is learned that the U.S. Consulate will issue a second notice next week, urging all American women and children in Shanghai to evacuate, with the exception of American men in Shanghai who have businesses and tasks. The U.S. garrison in Shanghai will also not be evacuated at present.

Commercial Firms Subsidize Staff Members' Travel Expenses

Most American nationals in this city have received the U.S. Consulate's notice to prepare for evacuation, and a small number have not been able to deliver it immediately due to unknown addresses. It is also confirmed that important American commercial firms in this city have received notices from their U.S. headquarters, advising their staff to evacuate their family members and subsidize their travel expenses. The content of this notice is said to be the same as that issued by the Mobil headquarters. Regarding ships, there is a severe shortage, but the U.S. Mail Steamship Company has been ordered to send the two largest U.S. merchant ships, the Washington and the Manhattan, to the Far East to assist in transporting evacuated Americans back home.

Japanese Residents in This City Panic

According to what foreign businessmen know, Japanese residents in this city are very panicked about the strong stance taken by the United States, especially Japanese merchants, as they are also self-aware. Some Japanese residents feel extremely difficult about the future of the Sino-Japanese war. If a U.S.-Japan war breaks out, the future of Japan is truly unimaginable. This kind of panic among Japanese residents is also very prevalent among Japanese personnel in some international organizations.

To Settle the European Situation, First Settle the Far East

Since the U.S. government has taken concrete actions with a strong stance in recent days, the attitude of Japanese official circles has softened. Some say that the situation may be easing, but this is not very optimistic among some foreign diplomats who lean towards democratic countries. According to the observations of a certain foreign diplomat, Japan must collude with Germany and Italy to the end, otherwise its diplomacy will become more isolated, but if it colludes with Germany and Italy, it cannot help but speak out and support Germany and Italy, and stand against Britain and the United States. The sudden softening of the Japanese attitude a few days ago was to quietly wait for the expression of Berlin and Rome, and according to the actual overall situation, if Britain and the United States want to stabilize the European situation, they must first defeat Japan, the weakest link in the Axis powers, and then deal with Europe. This is the best policy.

Japanese National Defense Relies on the United States

A reporter once asked a certain economic authority about the effects that U.S. economic sanctions against Japan could produce. According to him, a U.S. embargo against Japan at this time is a golden opportunity, because after the outbreak of the European war, Japan's required national defense and heavy industry products have completely relied on the United States for supply. Before the war, all aircraft parts, military equipment, vehicles, machinery, spare parts, and other items could still be imported from Germany in part. After the war broke out, the source was cut off. If the United States prohibits exports, Japan's national defense equipment and industrial construction will be hit immediately.

Great Power to Stabilize the World

The abundance of the United States' resource reserves is inherently unique, and the creativity of its people is no less than that of the Germanic peoples, so its manpower and material resources are unparalleled in the world. In addition, the natural resources of South America are sufficient for the United States to use, so it has the great power to stabilize the world, which is by no means an exaggeration. The United States' coal and gasoline production accounts for 60% of the world's total, and the United States' production of iron sand, iron ore, steel, copper, zinc, aluminum, and other important raw materials ranks first in the world. The manufacturing of vehicles and aircraft is also better than Germany's.

Economic Sanctions Are the Best Opportunity

Japan's previous arrogance towards the United States and its subsequent compliance are entirely due to its fear of the United States' manpower and material resources. Its threatening noises are based on the assumption that the United States may not be willing to shed blood. Therefore, it is hoped that the U.S. government and the public will know themselves and their enemies, resolutely implement economic sanctions, and not be intimidated by empty threats. The earlier the sanctions are implemented, the fewer opportunities there will be for the navy to shed blood, and the Pacific will be peaceful sooner.

### French Concession Police Will Mediate the Water and Electricity Workers' Strike Again: Engine Room Work Will Not Be Disrupted

It is heard that the striking workers, after a meeting in a certain place in Nanshi the day before yesterday afternoon, in addition to insisting on the original sixteen conditions and two new conditions, added the condition that temporary short-term workers will be given half a month's severance pay by the management when they resign, and wages will be paid for Sundays and holidays. It is heard that the management has expressed that the vehicle department can obtain the same treatment as the mechanical department with regard to the increase in rice subsidies, but the content of the sixteen conditions currently insisted on by the labor side has nothing to do with the interests of the mechanical department. Yesterday, due to the Sunday holiday, the labor side did not send representatives to visit the political affairs department authorities, nor did it hold a meeting. It is also learned that the parts of the Water and Electricity Company currently participating in the strike are the vehicle department, the mechanical department, and the engine room department, while the workers in the electrical department and the water department are still working as usual, and the management has rehired more than fifty White Russian workers to fill the engine room work, everything is prepared, so the water and electricity supply in the French Concession will definitely not be interrupted. Yesterday, the security at the Water and Electricity Company's main plant on Rue Lupan was still very tight.

### Impending Reopening of the Yunnan-Burma Road: Shanghai Merchants Rejoice, Anticipating Active Domestic Sales of Shanghai Goods; Thorough Measures in Place to Prevent Bombing; Southwest-Bound Mail to Be Routed Via Rangoon

Following the temporary closure of the Yunnan-Burma Road by the British side in mid-July, a period of three months has elapsed. The term expires on the 17th of this month, and the British government has decided to reopen it on the 18th. Merchants from all walks of life, both Chinese and foreign, are encouraged by this news. Despite Japan's various obstructions and protests, they ultimately failed to shake the British government's resolute confidence. A certain industrialist commented that since the Japanese army blockaded the Yunnan-Vietnam Road, followed by the coastal ports of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, which were also sealed off, China's foreign trade and domestic transportation have inevitably suffered some impact. However, the imminent reopening of the Yunnan-Burma Road means that various raw materials and armaments from Britain and the United States can be transported through this route, and goods from Shanghai destined for provinces such as Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Guangxi can also be transferred through this road without restrictions. Therefore, the reopening of this road is extremely important.

Caution Against Bombing

Since entering Vietnam, the Japanese army has occupied various buildings and important airfields, using them as bases for their air force. Bombing and destruction of the reopened Burma Road are naturally expected. The government has thorough plans in place to address this. Judging from the previous successes of repairing railways like Guangzhou-Kowloon and Nanning-Hanoi as soon as they were bombed, there will be no significant losses. Road workers and engineers are stationed along the entire road, and they will immediately set out to repair any damage caused by bombing, ensuring that vehicles will not be stopped due to road damage.

Returning Goods from Vietnam

Regarding the domestic sales situation, Mr. X mentioned that since the blockade of Shanghai, Vietnam, and various coastal ports, domestic sales of goods have almost completely disappeared. Although transportation between Shanghai and Hong Kong remains smooth, transportation to ports is intermittent. While goods from Shanghai can be transported to Hong Kong, whether they can be transferred onward is a problem. Recently, the Vietnamese government has agreed to return goods that were imported but remained within Vietnamese territory to Hong Kong, which is what the industrial and commercial sectors have been hoping for day and night. Although China and France had previously signed a treaty stipulating that goods destined for foreign countries or inland areas, transiting through Vietnam, would be released without detention, the Chinese diplomatic missions stationed there had already withdrawn, making it impossible to negotiate locally. Now, due to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' protest, the Vietnamese government has granted permission, which is a great blessing for merchants.

Mail Route Via Burma

Since the Yunnan-Burma Road is scheduled to reopen on the 18th of this month, the Shanghai Post Office has received a telegram from the General Post Office, deciding to route mail to the southwest through this line, entering through Rangoon and transporting it to the interior via the Yunnan-Burma Road. Subsequently, the postal delivery rate should increase compared to before. As for airmail, it will still be transported to Hong Kong and then transferred by airplane. Furthermore, since the outbreak of war in Vietnam, more than 30,000 pieces of mail had been stranded in Haiphong. The General Post Office is currently negotiating with the Vietnamese government for their release, and some have already been rushed out of Vietnam.

Shanghai Goods to Be Shipped

With the Yunnan-Burma Road scheduled to reopen on the 18th of this month, import and export firms in Shanghai are actively preparing to transport goods accumulated in Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Haiphong to the interior through this route. The ships that recently set sail from the port, such as Shen'ai, Jinan, Haisui, and Qingyuan, which set sail yesterday morning, are all heavily loaded, mostly with foreign imported goods transferred through Hong Kong, awaiting the opportunity to be transported in via the Yunnan-Burma Road. Therefore, the entire cargo transport is gradually showing signs of activity.

### Postal Savings and Remittances Bureau Plans to Establish a Savings Network Within the Year

The Postal Savings and Remittances Bureau has achieved considerable success in handling remittance business through years of effort. The number of bureaus handling savings and remittances currently totals thousands, but this only accounts for one-third of the total number of post offices in the country, which is more than three thousand. Now, in order to rapidly popularize the financial network and intensify the promotion of national savings for national construction, the National Government has instructed the Ministry of Communications to open savings businesses in all post offices and postal agencies with the potential to absorb deposits within the year, in order to absorb private idle funds and enrich the strength of resistance and national construction. At least one thousand postal savings personnel will be recruited and dispatched to various locations to provide services in the short term. The procedures for handling business should be adapted to local customs and prioritize the convenience of depositors. The Savings and Remittances Bureau is currently actively working on this, so as to complete the national savings and remittances network as scheduled within the year.

### Banking and Money Industry Funds Shift Inward, Decides to Cooperate with the "Four Banks"; First, Establish More Branches in the Interior; Special Caution in Lending in Shanghai

After a sharp increase in deposits in Shanghai's banks and money houses, the banks and money houses, realizing that reducing deposit interest rates could not solve the current crisis, selected the most reliable collateral for appropriate loans to avoid wasting interest. At the same time, they prepared to maintain 55% of the total deposit amount at all times. Because there is an extreme lack of proper investment channels in Shanghai, the problem of fund utilization has become increasingly serious, creating an unprecedented wave of speculation. After repeated consideration, the banks and money houses decided to transfer the surplus funds to the southwest, northwest, and inland areas, and cooperate with the Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Communications Bank, and Agricultural Bank of China to complete the mission of construction and development in the interior, indirectly curbing speculation in various underground markets in Shanghai.

Internal Transfer of Funds

In the past, less attention was paid to the finance of the southwest and northwest regions. Since the authorities have been steadily advancing in transportation, and highways and railways have been completed one after another, the industrial and commercial sectors are becoming increasingly prosperous. The authorities are providing various conveniences for investment in the interior. Therefore, major commercial banks in Shanghai are making every effort to establish branches in the interior to seek development to the greatest extent possible: (1) investing in land reclamation, water conservancy construction, and agricultural development; (2) investing in national defense production and mineral development; (3) investing in public transportation undertakings; (4) investing in economic construction undertakings; (5) investing in joint production and sales undertakings.

Increasing Reserves

Regarding various industrial and commercial loans within the Shanghai concession area, the banks and money houses have decided on principles. Credit loans are certainly out of the question. Except for money houses that grant loans to old customers as appropriate, banks completely refuse to undertake large-scale commodity mortgages. Moreover, fearing social criticism and suspicion of assisting hoarding and manipulation, they are extremely cautious in identifying and verifying commodity mortgages, requiring that their use be normal, so as to avoid being misunderstood by society on the one hand and not betraying the purpose of supporting industry and commerce on the other. However, in order to suit the environment during this time of resistance against Japan, they have increased reserves to cope with the situation.

### Gong Bida's Life Can Be Saved, Surgery Proceeding Well

Gong Bida, Deputy Inspector of the Chinese Constabulary of the Louza Central Police Station, was shot by a thug while returning to his residence from the police station at noon on the 8th. As he arrived at the entrance of Rihui Lane on Jin Shenfu Road, he was ambushed by a thug who pulled out a gun. He was shot twice in the back, but neither bullet exited. Gong fell to the ground after being wounded, and the assailant fled. He was sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment in an ambulance. It is reported that after Gong entered the hospital, his condition was critical and he lost too much blood, so the doctor did not perform surgery. It wasn't until the morning of the day before yesterday that his condition showed slight improvement, so surgery was performed to remove one bullet. Another bullet will take more time to remove. However, the surgery is proceeding well, and his life may be saved.

### British Deputy Inspector Resigns to Serve the Country, Scheduled to Enlist in Malaya on the 14th, Police Officers Host a Farewell Banquet and Present Souvenirs

According to the Continental Daily, British Deputy Inspector Gault of the Xinzha Road Police Station has served in the Public Works Department Police for 14 years and has made considerable achievements. He recently resigned and is scheduled to leave Shanghai with his family on the 14th of this month to enlist in Malaya and serve the country. The police officers of the Xinzha Road Police Station held a private gathering at the police station yesterday (the 12th) at noon to bid him farewell and presented him with three gifts, including a watch, and raised funds to donate to the British War Fund. Gault previously served in the British Army. In July 1926, he joined the Public Works Department Police, serving in the Criminal Division and the Political Division. He was also once responsible for intelligence matters at the Police Department.

### After Britain and the United States Adopted Tough Policies, the Situation in the Far East Eased; Comments from British Commentator Woodhead

British commentator Woodhead commented on the situation in the Far East in the English-language Greater Shanghai Weekly: "Last week was one of the most tense weeks in the Far East, the reason being the talks between Konoe and Matsuoka with the United States. Japan has actually notified the United States that unless the United States stops aiding China, does not oppose the 'New Order in Greater Asia', and cooperates with Japan to create a new order, Japan has no other way to go but to engage in war. When the US election campaign was at its most intense, the purpose of Japan's threat was to create division in the United States' opinions and prevent it from making decisions. The US government was not shocked by this threat at all, and is preparing to pay Japan's final move. The embargo is increasing, and naval reservists are also being called up. The US fleet and troops stationed in Hawaii are being strengthened. At the same time, overseas Chinese who do not have important tasks in the Far East are being advised to withdraw from China, Japan, and Vietnam. The attitude of the US official and press commentary has been very clear."

Empty Threats, Complete Failure

The United States considers it an intolerable insult to change its policies due to Japan's demands. The United States' response to Konoe and Matsuoka's threats, and Britain's announcement of the opening of the Yunnan-Burma Road, have a calming effect on Japan. The roaring attitude of the Japanese press has greatly decreased, and the Foreign Ministry's explanation is also mitigating the trend of this crisis becoming serious. What surprised Japan was that the United States lightly regarded the threat to Tokyo. Although this matter is not optimistic, the danger of an immediate war between Japan and the United States, although not completely resolved, can be said to have eased somewhat when the author drafted this article. Even the provocation of opening the Yunnan-Burma Road to Britain will not lead to a serious conflict, unless some irresponsible Japanese pilots mistakenly recognize Hong Kong and Burma as Chinese territory, or mistake British and American mail ships as targets for shooting practice.

The Plight of Small European Countries

As for the military moves in Europe, both sides are still limited to air raids. Neither Britain nor Germany has solved how to deal with night raids. However, the British Royal Air Force has focused its attention on military targets, constantly inflicting great damage on German seaports, airfields, invasion bases, oil refineries, armaments factories, and railway centers. The British Royal Air Force's visit to Berlin is enough to make the German government quickly evacuate children. To what extent the Axis powers' conspiracy in the Balkans will go remains to be seen. Germany and Italy are causing the disintegration of Romania in order to win the sympathy of the Romanian people. Now, they are using military occupation of its remaining territory to express their friendship. The new European order does not care about the rights and claims of small countries. These countries are being whipped and enjoying "new freedom" under the Axis powers. China has been betrayed by France, and Kunming has suffered severely damaged air raids. How do the French people feel about the simple words in the letter attached to the paper umbrella presented by the Chinese community in Kunming to Marshal Pétain, saying: "Japan has bombed the cities of Yunnan. Thank you for your kindness. There is an ancient Chinese saying: 'Prepare for a rainy day.' Therefore, we specially present you with a Chinese paper umbrella."?

Japanese Soldiers Set Up Sentries in the Western District of Shanghai

The Haig Road area in the western part of the French Concession has always been patrolled by French Concession police. On the afternoon of the day before yesterday (the 11th), four Japanese military police suddenly set up sentry posts at the intersection of Mackenzie Road and Haig Road, strictly checking pedestrians, creating a tense atmosphere.

### Public Bus Crushes a Man to Death; Autopsy Scheduled for Today; Relatives to Be Notified to Identify the Body

At 1:03 PM yesterday, a Route 9 public bus owned by the British-owned China General Omnibus Company, driven by driver Lu Hengchang, No. 117 (23 years old, from Yangzhou, residing at No. 28, Kangle Village, Connaught Road), was traveling east on Avenue Foch towards the Zhaofeng Garden in western Shanghai. When it reached the western end of the intersection of Weihaiwei Road, near No. 865, Model Village, an unnamed man, about 30 years old, wearing a gray serge long gown, was crossing the road from north to south. When he reached the center of the road, the driver swerved the front of the bus to the south side of the French Concession boundary line to avoid him. Unexpectedly, in a state of panic, the man ran in front of the bus, and the bus was unable to brake in time, knocking the man down and crushing his head, killing him instantly. The Jing'an Temple Police Station was notified and dispatched detectives to investigate. The body was transported to the corpse examination office on Jiaozhou Road. As the incident occurred within the French Concession boundary line, the French Police Station was notified and sent detectives to investigate the scene and took the driver back to the police station for questioning. The body was transferred to the Tongren Supplementary Yuan Branch for a corpse examination, and the court will be requested to send personnel to inspect it today, and the relatives of the deceased will be notified. The deceased had short hair, cut in a Yuanping style, wearing a gray long gown, with a white short shirt and trousers inside, a gray cloth short shirt, old white-gray cloth leggings, gray Western socks, and wool-lined leather shoes. A notebook was found on his person, but there was no name or address. It only contained the telephone numbers of several well-known incense and candle shops such as Wang Dayou and Wang Dasheng, suggesting that he was a salesman or broker in the incense and candle business. If there are any family members or relatives, they can go to the Tongren Supplementary Yuan Branch for a corpse examination to identify and claim the body. The deceased had a lot of dark hair on his chest and abdomen.

### After Li Yuying's Death, So Many Disputes; Tailor Sues for Labor and Material Costs

Li Yuying, a female nurse from Fujian who worked as the head nurse at the Franco-Chinese Sanatorium on Rue de Pushi, died suddenly in her bedroom on the night of June 10th, causing various disputes. Lu Zhenqing, the superintendent of the hospital, and Lin Zhengliang, a doctor, were prosecuted by the prosecutor of the Special No. 2 Court for the crime of forging certificates because they did not follow the regulations of the concession hospital to report the corpse to the police station for inspection, and instead signed a certificate stating that she died of a stroke. The first instance ruled Lu and Lin not guilty. Subsequently, the prosecutor handling the case appealed to the High Court Branch. Furthermore, because the deceased left behind more than ten thousand yuan in cash, clothing, etc., and the hospital did not hand it over to the deceased's relatives, the deceased's father, Li Shizhen, filed a lawsuit against Lu Zhenqing in the Special No. 2 Court to preserve evidence. In addition, the China Funeral Home filed two cases in the Special No. 2 Court against Li Shizhen, seeking to recover more than 2,000 yuan for the deceased's funeral expenses. While these were being investigated, accounts were examined, and witnesses were summoned, Bao Arong, a tailor on Avenue Albert, who made clothes for the deceased Li Yuying and purchased clothing materials, had an outstanding balance of 82 yuan for labor and materials before her death. Two pieces of clothing were still at Bao's shop. After Li's death, her father took them away, but he delayed paying the outstanding labor and material costs. Therefore, Bao Arong sued Li Shizhen, the deceased's father, in the civil court of the Special No. 2 Court, seeking a judgment for compensation. The case was heard by Judge Chen Ziguan the day before yesterday, who summoned both parties for trial. The hearing was adjourned, and the judgment is pending.

### Boiler Operator Training Class, Registration Tonight

In order to save costs for hot water equipment in various apartments, the Industrial Section of the Public Works Department has decided to set up a boiler operator training class to specifically train boiler operators hired by various apartments located east of Jing'an Temple to the Bund, teaching them safe and economical methods for burning boilers. It is learned that the section is scheduled to conduct registration for trainees at the Health Sub-Office at No. 340 Hankou Road at 7:00 PM tonight (the 14th). Apartment owners who wish to send their boiler operators to attend the class should instruct them to report to the aforementioned location on time.

### Russian Woman Feigns Fainting, Robbers Unable to Plunder Fully; Company Suffers Loss of Several Thousand Yuan; Robbers Only Make Off with Over Two Hundred Yuan

According to the North-China Daily News, Heng Shi Bao Company in the Central Arcade on Nanjing Road was robbed yesterday (the 12th). Fortunately, a Russian female employee named Moxina was quick-witted, which allowed the company to suffer a loss of several thousand yuan. The incident occurred at 4:55 PM, after Heng Shi Bao Company had closed for business, with only the Russian woman and one Chinese employee remaining in the office,

Work Not Yet Finished

Suddenly, four robbers armed with handguns broke in. One robber pulled the curtains, and the remaining robbers used ropes to tie up the Chinese employee. Then, they forced the Russian woman to take out the safe key, but to no avail. The robbers then searched on their own and finally found the key in a desk drawer. They forced the Russian woman to sit down, place her hands on her knees, and tied her hands with ropes. Seizing the opportunity, they robbed the Russian woman of her diamond ring and gold watch. The robbers

Opened the Safe

And discovered that another key was needed to open the cash box inside. Seeing this, the Russian woman pretended to faint to avoid being forced to take out the key. The robbers were unable to open the cash box and only robbed 286 yuan before escaping from the back door. If the robbers had forced the Russian woman to take out the cash box key, the dozens of yuan contained in the box would have fallen into their hands.

### A Gardener Stabbed to Death in a Westerner's Garden; Gardener Previously Captured a Thief and Beat Him Severely; This Attack Appears to Be Revenge by the Thief

A stabbing assassination occurred in the garden of a Westerner's residence at No. 210 Gordon Road, Shanghai, at approximately 4:00 AM yesterday morning. The victim was the gardener of the residence, named Yu Lun, who was stabbed six times, all in vital areas, and died on the spot. The assailant was a thief who fled after the incident. The details were learned after investigation. Yu Lun was 50 years old, a local, and had been working as a gardener and gatekeeper in the Westerner's residential garden for many years, earning a monthly salary of 15 yuan. Because he was loyal and diligent, he was deeply favored by the Westerner. However, the area is remote, and thefts often occur. The garden of the residence is also often coveted by thieves. There was one instance when a thief broke in to steal property and was captured by Yu, who beat him before releasing him, causing the thief to harbor resentment and develop the idea of harming him. At approximately 4:00 AM yesterday morning, Yu was sleeping soundly in the gatehouse as usual when the thief took the opportunity to sneak in and attack with a sharp knife, stabbing Yu all over. He was stabbed twice in the head, twice in the left and right hands, once in the waist, and once in the right shoulder. Blood splattered everywhere, and he was barely breathing. Seeing that he had achieved his goal, the assailant fled. It wasn't until dawn that he was discovered by other servants of the residence. Unfortunately, Yu had already died from his injuries. They reported it to the owner, who then reported it to the Jing'an Temple Police Station, which dispatched detectives to investigate the scene and took footprints and fingerprints at the scene of the incident. Yu's body was transported to the corpse examination office on Jiaozhou Road, and the Special No. 1 Court was requested to send personnel to inspect and coffin the body. The police station has ordered police officers to pursue and investigate the escaped suspect in order to deter criminals.

### American Company Has Filed a Lawsuit Over a Two Million Yuan Theft; Believes Ruifeng Company Should Be Responsible; The Thief, Hult, Has Not Yet Been Apprehended

Swiss Consul General to Shanghai, Fontanel, submitted a memorandum to the Japanese Consul General the day before yesterday (the 11th), requesting cooperation and assistance in arresting the thief, Swiss citizen Hult, due to the fact that the Public Works Department Police's arrest of the thief, Swiss national Hult, was obstructed by the Japanese military police, resulting in the escape of the criminal. According to Police Chief Bainetto of the Public Works Department, he and police officers from the Japanese Consulate went to the Broadway Mansions in Hongkou last Thursday to arrest the thief Hult but were interfered with by Japanese military police who arrived at the scene, so that he could not be arrested. The circumstances of the case are very complicated. Since last Thursday, part of the copper ingots stored in the warehouse of Ruifeng Transport Company, worth US$100,000, has been moved. This batch of copper ingots belongs to the American company Maosheng Foreign Company. It was used as a payment when the Chinese government purchased machinery from the United States in 1937, and Hult claimed that the transaction was illegal. He believed that this batch of copper ingots was "contraband," so he represented the Japanese army in moving them away. The Maosheng Foreign Company denied Hult's claims the day before yesterday, and the company filed a civil lawsuit against the Ruifeng Transport Company, which should be responsible for the storage, in the American court.

### Western Union First Division Football Match: Tung Wah Achieves a Victorious Start, Defeating Jewish Recreation Club 4-3, After Trailing 1-2 in the First Half

The second act of the Western Union First Division football match took place yesterday at the Recreation Ground between Tung Wah and the Jewish Recreation Club. The crowd gathered, exceeding three thousand, creating a grand spectacle. In the first half, the Jewish Recreation Club took the lead with 2-1. However, Tung Wah's fortunes turned, resulting in a 2-2 tie, and ultimately, they triumphed with a score of 4-3. Tung Wah had numerous opportunities but failed to capitalize on them. Although the Jewish Recreation Club was a Second Division team, they were newly promoted this year and scored twice in the first ten minutes. Tung Wah, amidst a difficult struggle, eventually overcame their opponents.

Tung Wah Team

Chin But-ko

Lee Ning, Chong Yau-yan

Leung Shu-tong, Tsoi Sing-sam, Hon Lung-hoi

Ng Ping-ho, Wong Hak-hau, Tai Lun-king, Ng Ki-cheung, Fei Chun-wa

Jewish Recreation Club Team

Cohen

Reisberg, Kremer

S. Shawi, Meyer, Donasfer

Jacob, Lawson-Hui, Abbott, Larent, Schamroth

Two Goals Conceded in the First Ten Minutes

The Jewish Recreation Club kicked off first, maneuvering in midfield without much progress for about two minutes. Suddenly, Tung Wah advanced from the right, bombarding the Jewish defense. Unfortunately, Tai Lun-king and Ng Ki-cheung missed their targets. The Jewish team launched a counterattack, and in the fifth minute, Schamroth crossed from the side, and Lawson-Hui headed the ball into the net. At that moment, the sun was shining, and Schamroth's cross fell from a high position, dazzling Chin But-ko, allowing Lawson-Hui to score. After conceding a goal, Tung Wah intensified their attack, but due to being overly hasty, they found it difficult to penetrate. The Jewish team, with their morale high, seized the opportunity to attack repeatedly. Five minutes later, the Tung Wah penalty area was besieged again, with enemy players crisscrossing in front of the goal. Jacob, from about twenty yards near the goal, volleyed another ball into the net amidst the chaos. Tung Wah lost two key positions in the first ten minutes. Tai Lun-king, in a fit of anger, finally recovered a goal four minutes later. After that, both sides defended very tightly, and the actions were extremely intense. Jewish Recreation Club's right-back Kremer even dislocated his right arm due to the intensity of the battle and had to retire, leaving them to play with only ten men for no less than twenty minutes. Tung Wah's luck was not good, and many attacks failed by a hair's breadth. The first half ended with Tung Wah trailing 1-2.

Turning the Tide, Coming from Behind

After the lemon break, both teams resumed the match. Tung Wah turned the tide. Just three minutes into the second half, Tai Lun-king penetrated the enemy's line, received a pass from Ng Ki-cheung, and volleyed the ball into the net, tying the score at 2-2. From then on, Tung Wah became increasingly impressive, and the Jewish Recreation Club was helpless. Lee Ning and Chong Yau-yan were like two iron gates. At that time, the situation on the front line was tense, and Fei Chun-wa had to withdraw due to cramps. Ng Ki-cheung was reassigned to the right wing and returned to the field five minutes later. At this time, Tung Wah's morale was high, and the Jewish Recreation Club retreated to a corner. All the attacks were controlled by Tung Wah. In the twenty-fifth minute, the Jewish Recreation Club's right inside-forward Kremer fouled Tai in the penalty area, resulting in a penalty kick. Tsoi Sing-sam took the shot, which was as fast as a cannonball. Tung Wah then took the lead with 3-2. Tung Wah's attack remained strong. There was a wonderful link-up between Ng Ki-cheung and Tai. Tai crossed to the center, a perfect position, but Fei Chun-wa was slightly slower due to the aftereffects of the cramps, resulting in a missed opportunity. However, one minute later (33rd minute), Fei broke through and crossed in front of the goal. Tai rushed forward and slid in at the eighteen-yard mark, hitting the upper left corner, establishing the winning score of 4-3. However, Fei aggravated his old injury due to excessive effort and had to withdraw again. The Jewish Recreation Club launched a desperate counterattack, and finally, in the fortieth minute, Tsoi's interception failed, allowing Frallent to shovel the ball into the net from fifteen yards, hitting the crossbar and bouncing into the net. It was too fast and sharp, and But-ko was unable to save it. In the next five minutes, the entire Tung Wah team retreated to defend, ending the game with a score of 4-3. Tung Wah celebrated a triumphant victory.

### Charity Challenge Basketball Main Match: Paramount to Play Shanghai Youth on Saturday, Ticket Prices Raised to Five and Ten Dollars, with Special Honorary Tickets for Auction

The final match of the charity basketball challenge, Shanghai Youth vs. Paramount, is scheduled for this Saturday (the 19th). The two teams engaged in an unprecedented fierce battle in the recent Union Cup. This reunion in the challenge is highly anticipated. Shanghai Youth has been training hard for a long time, ready to give it their all. Therefore, this great match will be even more exciting. The organizers, to avoid excessive crowding and to raise more funds for charity, have increased the ticket prices again. Honorary tickets are priced at ten dollars each, and regular tickets are priced at five dollars each. Pre-sales will start today at all sales points.

It is expected that there will be an unexpectedly large number of participants in the bidding. In addition, the charity match between Qunyi was postponed to the next match with Shanghai Youth at the request of the major philanthropists and will be auctioned at the same time. Therefore, there will be a double auction performance in the grand event on Saturday. At the same time, to leave a glorious memento for the winners of this charity ball game who generously donated to help those in need, Mr. Yuan has launched a "Six-Person Club." After the final two ball winners are produced, Mr. Yuan will host a commemorative photograph. In addition to being hung in public places to highlight the virtue, it will also be distributed to the relevant ball winners, so that they may be remembered for generations to come.

In other news, before the main match between Shanghai Youth and Paramount on Saturday, there will be a women's performance, Youyou vs. Jingwu. It is also heard that the Giants team, which defeated Nanyang last time, is now challenging Paramount's second team. If this becomes a reality, it will be performed together on Saturday.

### Changes and Characteristics of the Shanghai Exchange Market Since "May 2nd"

— Shi Yiwen

After the retreat of the National Army to the west, the government was unable to exercise its authority in Shanghai, and its financial control over Shanghai was also weakened. In March 1938, the government implemented foreign exchange control to protect China's wartime finance. However, due to the special circumstances of the concessions, the underground market's speculative activities could not be banned, and the Central Bank's foreign exchange control buying and selling system could not be maintained. The official exchange rate existed only in form, and the underground market rate actually dominated the exchange market. Since then, the exchange market has become increasingly uncontrolled, the market rate has fluctuated dramatically, and those who buy and sell foreign exchange are all aimed at speculation and profit. This situation is certainly extremely unfavorable to the entire wartime economy. However, since "May 2nd," the situation seems to have changed. Although the market rate still fluctuates, the pressure on the exchange market from speculators has been greatly reduced due to the government's success in maintaining the legal tender policy. So generally speaking, the exchange market after "May 2nd" is more stable than before. The following will discuss the changes in the exchange market after "May 2nd" and the recent situation, as well as some particularly special issues.

Changes in the Exchange Market After "May 2nd"

The "May 2nd" foreign exchange meeting's resumption of the suspension of the sale of foreign exchange was originally an economic defense strategy of the government. Its purpose was to strike at the Japanese economic offensive (the war-supporting policy) on the one hand, and to strike at speculative activities that sacrificed national and ethnic interests on the other. At the time, we also described it this way, but speculators did not view it that way. They still followed their past experience, believing that the longer the war lasted, the more the legal tender exchange rate would fall. Therefore, despite the already tight market rate, their scavenging work was still very vigorous. But in the end, they failed. In less than three weeks, the exchange rate returned to the level before "May 2nd." Previously, speculators always earned more and lost less, but only this time did they suffer heavy blows, with some going bankrupt and others disappearing or committing suicide. This trend also affected other speculative markets, and the entire Shanghai market declined as a result.

After "May 2nd," Shanghai's various speculative markets were very depressed, and the exchange market also changed very little. In early July, in order to fight for the right to export materials from the occupied areas and the free areas, the government revised the commercial exchange rate to four and a half (originally seven). This measure is obviously the same as the "May 2nd" suspension of foreign exchange sales in meaning, and is another strategy of economic defense warfare. However, the speculators, whose wounds had not yet healed, thought it was an opportunity for activity, so they competed to buy and hoard, resulting in the exchange rate being pulled down to about five and a half yuan (it was about six yuan at the end of June). Later (mid-August), due to the blockade of the Yunnan-Vietnam and Yunnan-Burma roads, the withdrawal of British troops, and the Japanese military's threat to Vietnam, a panic psychology formed in the market, and the exchange rate dropped again near the five-yuan mark. In early September, although it rose slightly, the trend was still hovering, and people's hearts were still tight. It was not until the end of September, when the Sino-US loan was successful, that it soared to beyond the five-and-a-half-yuan mark. (Speculators suffered another major blow.)

The main reason for this sudden surge in the exchange market was of course the success of the Sino-US loan. However, we must point out here that the real reason for this surge in the exchange market was not the fact that the loan was successful, but the significance of the loan's success. This significance was particularly evident after the announcement of the Tripartite Pact between Germany, Italy, and Japan, and played a significant role.

In terms of the loan's facts, the total amount was only 25 million US dollars. Using this amount to maintain the exchange market, we can frankly say that it would not have any effect. Moreover, the nature of this loan was exactly the same as the previous ones. In other words, it was an extension of the previous Sino-US loan agreement, and in fact not a new loan. Therefore, in terms of the nature and facts of this loan, its influence on the exchange market was also limited. This point can also be seen from the actual exchange market situation after the news of the loan's success reached Shanghai. I remember that the news reached the market around noon on September 26. At that time, although people in the market knew that the loan was successful, they did not know the details, so there were many rumors. Therefore, many people were hesitant to sell, and the market rate once rose from 5.3125 yuan to 5.46875 yuan, and finally closed at 5.4062 yuan. (A rise of 0.09375). The next day, the news content was published in various newspapers, and the market rate turned back to 5.375 yuan. This clearly shows that people did not attach much importance to this news. It was not until the news of the Tripartite Pact came (September 27) that people's hearts were stirred, and the exchange market took a sharp turn for the worse, soaring from 5.40625 yuan to 5.625 yuan. (Market rate on September 30)

The Sino-US loan and the Tripartite Pact were originally two different facts, but there was a causal relationship between them. We know that China's loan activities with the United States have been going on for some time. It was not successful before, but it was successful when the Tripartite Pact was about to be announced. This clearly shows the United States' intentions: it will intensify its aid to China, and the United States itself is also determined to participate in the war. Under the display of this significance, people with foreign exchange in hand naturally became panicked, and the loosening of the exchange market was inevitable.

Special Characteristics of the Exchange Market After "May 2nd"

The above is just a general analysis of the changes in the exchange market after "May 2nd" and the recent situation. Now, we would like to discuss several special issues that have appeared in the exchange market after "May 2nd." On the one hand, these special issues can be said to be the special characteristics of the exchange market after "May 2nd," and at the same time, they can also be said to be the reason why the legal tender exchange rate after "May 2nd" has been relatively stable.

First, the one-way decline of the legal tender exchange rate before "May 2nd" was largely the result of speculative activities, but the huge trade deficit was also one of the reasons. Judging from the customs' statistical reports, if the monthly import and export amounts are calculated in foreign exchange, then the total trade deficit for the entire country from January to August this year is 42 million pounds. If this deficit needs to be settled in foreign exchange, then the pressure on the exchange market will be considerable. However, for the current exchange rate, this pressure has not been expressed. Being able to maintain today's exchange rate with such a huge trade deficit is indeed a "mystery." Or some people use the reason of "overseas Chinese remittances" to solve this "mystery," but there were also overseas Chinese remittances in the same period last year, and the amount of the trade deficit was less than this year (41 million pounds), but the exchange rate fell more than this year. We believe that to solve this "mystery," we can only explain it from the potential of legal tender. Because the evolution of the past situation was unpredictable, the amount of legal tender exchanged into foreign exchange for storage or escape abroad was very considerable. (This foreign exchange storage and escape capital are all the potential of legal tender.) Since "May 2nd," because the prospects for the war have become optimistic, the status of legal tender has become more stable, and the past escape capital (including stored foreign exchange) has returned one after another (the increase in Shanghai bank deposits is a counter-evidence), thus offsetting a portion of the huge trade deficit. We have no way to prove this fact from statistics, but we are certain that it is related to the relative stability of the exchange market after "May 2nd."

Second, the speculative activities of any speculator must have a prerequisite, that is, to have speculative funds. If there are not enough funds, even if there is an opportunity for speculation, it may not be possible to proceed. Before "May 2nd," there was a considerable amount of hot money in Shanghai. Therefore, speculators also had to use this hot money to operate. But judging from the situation of exchange drafts, discounts, and bank deposits, there was more hot money after "May 2nd" than before. In terms of the speculative environment, it is more suitable for speculative activities. But in fact, speculators cannot use these large amounts of hot money to make greater threats to the exchange market than before. This phenomenon is obviously due to the fact that speculators were hit after "May 2nd" and did not dare to operate as recklessly as in the past. Therefore, it gave the stability of the exchange market a lot of help.

Third, the past attacks and oppression of the legal tender by the Japanese, and the frequent tightening of the exchange market were also related. Since "May 2nd," the Japanese have deeply felt that the depreciation of the legal tender is also unfavorable to the Japanese, so they have stopped attacking the legal tender and adopted a more realistic policy! On the one hand, they use legal tender, and on the other hand, they strengthen the value of military tickets. This change in the Japanese policy has naturally reduced a major pressure on the exchange market. However, we want to add here that the Japanese change in the policy of attacking the legal tender is not the reason why the exchange market after "May 2nd" can be relatively stable. On the contrary, it is the result of the legal tender's abundant strength and the Japanese knowing that they cannot destroy it.

The Future of the Shanghai Exchange Market

How will the Shanghai exchange market develop in the future? To answer this question, we must examine it from two aspects: first, whether the value of foreign exchange (US dollars or British pounds) itself will change; and second, what the future of legal tender is.

In terms of the first point, whether the value of the US dollar or British pound will change depends on how the situation in the Pacific develops. If there is no change in the Pacific, then the value of the US dollar and British pound will certainly not change in the future. Conversely, if there is a conflict between the United States and Britain and Japan in the Pacific, then Shanghai's transportation and trade relations with the United States and Britain will inevitably be cut off, and it is not difficult to guess who will control the Shanghai market. At this time, there is a question as to whether Shanghai still has a foreign exchange supply and demand relationship. Because the occurrence of the foreign exchange market is originally based on foreign trade relations. Once the trade relationship is cut off, the foreign exchange supply and demand relationship will naturally have no way to occur. Without a foreign exchange supply and demand relationship, the foreign exchange market cannot be established. In this way, even if the value (purchasing power) of the US dollar or British pound remains unchanged in their own country, but because people in Shanghai who hold US dollars or British pounds cannot purchase goods from that country, and no one wants to buy them on the market, then the foreign exchange becomes a property on the books. In other words, it becomes a bad debt that cannot be recovered. When this bad debt can be recovered depends on when the war ends and trade relations are restored. To take a step back, even if the United States and Britain and Japan are waging war in the Pacific, and Shanghai's trade relations with the United States and Britain still exist, because the United States implements foreign exchange control, the external value of the US dollar will inevitably be affected, and the exchange rate of the US dollar against legal tender will naturally fall. This situation has already been significantly manifested in the recent Shanghai exchange market. The United States and Japan have not yet started war, and the situation is already like this. After the official start of the war, the impact will certainly be greater. (The depreciation of the US dollar, British pound, Hong Kong dollar, etc. will also follow the depreciation, which is self-evident)

Secondly, in terms of the future of legal tender. If a war breaks out in the Pacific, the value of legal tender will certainly improve (as mentioned above), which is unnecessary to say. If the international situation remains unchanged and the Sino-Japanese war still exists, we can also say with certainty that the value of legal tender will only rise and will not fall. What is the reason?

We feel that the establishment and evolution of the legal tender system is quite symbolic of the development of the Chinese nation in recent years. The life of legal tender is entrusted to the unified foundation of the Chinese nation, so the fate of Chinese legal tender is also completely consistent with the fate of the Chinese nation. If it is determined that the Chinese nation has no future, then there is no point in discussing whether legal tender has value in the future. But the current facts show us that the Chinese people have established the foundation of national liberation through more than three years of hard fighting and countless sacrifices of blood and flesh, which cannot be destroyed by any external force. Therefore, we can conclude that legal tender, which shares the future of the nation, will never have a reason to fall again in the future. On the contrary, due to the exhaustion of the aggressors and the increasingly favorable international situation, the new life of the Chinese nation is constantly strengthening. The future value of legal tender will only develop upwards day by day.

How Will Foreign Exchange Trends Develop?

At the beginning of September, when foreign exchange tightened, my observation was that the tightness in exchange rates at that time was due to the old bulls and those using rumors and the Vietnam situation to sell their August-term exchange purchased in July. The new bulls hoped to profit from the tightening exchange rates caused by the Vietnam situation. I predicted that the chances of exchange rates easing were greater than the chances of tightening. In fact, in September, apart from the tightest price of the month on the 4th, at £3.4375 and $5.09375, although the market situation fluctuated between tightness and looseness, it generally showed a tendency to hover upwards. However, the changes in the first half of the month did not have a clear trajectory. Entering the first week of the second half of the month, the lowest US dollar price stopped at 5.25, and the second week's opening, closing, high, and low records all rose uniformly. As for the British pound, the lowest price generally stopped at 3.484375 and above.

The expectation of exchange rates hovering and easing was originally based on the hope of an improvement in the international situation favorable to China's war of resistance. Sure enough, on September 26th, the United States formally announced the continuation of a $25 million loan to China, followed by the Axis powers declaring the establishment of a military and economic alliance between Germany, Italy, and Japan, and Japan's empty threats to the United States. The United States responded with various measures of preparedness for war, and Britain decided to reopen the Burma Road. The situation in the Pacific Ocean changed drastically, and foreign exchange bulls sold endlessly. The US dollar suddenly rose to 5.625 at the end of September, rose again to 5.78125 on October 7th, and broke through the 6 yuan mark on the 9th, reaching a high price of 6.0625; the British pound also reached a high price of 3.875 on October 9th. Speculators who bought October-term exchange at market prices of around £3.5 and $5.3 in September, since the end of September, realizing the unfavorable situation, have been cutting their losses to avoid further losses due to any more unfavorable developments in the Pacific situation for the bulls. However, the foreign exchange market situation has hovered and contracted again this weekend. What will the future trend be?

Let's start with the international situation. The reason why the exchange market has tightened somewhat in the past two days is that there has been no new development in the Pacific situation. After the United States responded to Japan's empty threats with strong actions, the "no hesitation to fight" attitude turned into a moderate tone. Foreign Minister Matsuoka Yosuke asserted that the Tripartite Pact was aimed at the United States, hoping that the United States and other countries in a neutral position would not be drawn into the vortex of the European war, and would not clash with Japan because of the China issue or other reasons. Speculators therefore believe that although the situation in the Pacific Ocean is on the verge of explosion, Japan does not have the courage to launch an attack on the United States. Secondly, from Japan's economic perspective, it is well known that Japan lacks foreign exchange. The resources for the current war completely rely on the ability to export trade with Britain and the United States. If Japan disregards everything and starts a war with Britain and the United States, the silk goods sold to the United States and the cotton goods sold to Britain will inevitably lose their original markets. The cotton industry, the economic lifeline of Japan, would find it difficult to obtain the supply of raw cotton from the United States and Egypt, and it would be even more difficult to obtain copper from Canada, minerals from the United States, and iron and jute from India, as well as nickel, aluminum, tungsten, etc. from Britain. At present, the various economic embargoes imposed by the United States on Japan have already caused Japan great inconvenience. Once Japan goes to war with Britain and the United States, a comprehensive economic war by Britain and the United States against Japan will cause Japan's export trade to come to a complete halt. Military resources would be impossible to obtain. Without waiting for a military victory, Japan would be placed in a situation of certain defeat economically. Therefore, Japan would never dare to go to war with the United States and Britain. With the elimination of the negative factors, the market turned tighter.

If the above is true, the exchange market may hover around the current level or even contract slightly in the near future. However, the situation in the Pacific Ocean will certainly not continue as Suma, a spokesman for the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, claimed, "The overall situation here is very calm." The Axis powers of Germany and Italy are letting Japan maintain its vested interests in Vietnam. The Axis powers' whip of challenge is whipping the Japanese military tightly. The opening of the滇緬 Burma Road, and the active aid to China by the United States and Britain, are huge conflicts and blows to Japan's determination to build a "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere." The situation changes rapidly. There are many negative factors and few positive factors. This can be determined. Let's further speculate based on the situation as follows: (To be continued)

### Raw White Slightly Up

Yesterday, the lower grade "car white" continued to ease. The association's price was 14.75 yuan per picul for spot raw white from local warehouses, up 0.20 yuan; 74.80 yuan per picul from foreign warehouses, up 0.40 yuan. Re-export spot remained at 59 yuan. Dutch Red spot was 56.30 yuan. Taikoo "car white" B mark from western warehouses was 72.50 yuan, up 0.20 yuan; DY mark 70.40 yuan, up a small 0.80 yuan; HX mark 69.80 yuan, down a small 1 yuan.

### Cooked Coal Soars

Recently, it has been heard that the output of cooked coal from 自來火行 "self-ignition" suppliers is low, and the cost of sources from various places is high due to high external expenses, making it uneconomical. As a result, spot goods are decreasing daily, and prices are soaring. Among industry peers, cooked coal chunks are 190 yuan per ton, and unified coal is 185 yuan. Local street shops generally sell it for 10 yuan per picul, it is said.

### Dried Longan at Unprecedented High Price

Due to the long interruption of shipments and lack of stock in the market, dried longan from Fuqing, with dozens of varieties, which arrived a few days ago, are regarded as rare commodities. It was heard yesterday that the price had already been opened, four to five times higher than before, creating an unprecedented high price. Xing Si Yuan's sales have even been raised to 760 yuan. However, it is heard that there are efforts to transport goods from 石碼 Shima and Quanzhou, etc., and the market will inevitably ease later.

### Walnuts Also Trending Upward

This year's new walnut harvest is still abundant, but due to the difficulty of sourcing and the small amount of goods arriving, the price has been rising again and again. Yesterday, 200 bags of ordinary Qingzhou peaches were opened, priced at 94 yuan, which is the same as the opening price of the first batch of hand-picked peaches. It is also a new high price.

### Black Iron Billets Firm and Steady

The market for black iron billets has recently been quite lively due to the enthusiastic bidding from local hot water bottle factories, etc. However, customers from other places are unable to purchase in large quantities due to shipping schedules and transportation difficulties, so they are unable to raise prices. Currently, good quality goods are sold at 1,300 yuan per 2,000 pounds, while the second-best quality is sold at 1,000 yuan plus an odd bundle.

### Thin Galvanized Iron Sheets Attractive

Due to the wide range of users and the lack of raw materials, thin galvanized iron sheets are not produced much by the factories, and the stock in the hands of traders is also limited. For a time, the trend was exceptionally hot, and the asking price soared. Currently, 3' x 7' sheets are sold at 8.50 yuan each, and 3' x 6' sheets also require 7.50 yuan, it is said.

### China's Wartime Finance (Continued 2)

— Yu Xie Lin

(3) Improvement of the Wartime Tax System

According to the financial precedents of various countries, increasing taxes is originally the mainstay of wartime finance. During the Fifth European War, the United States advocated the "half tax, half bond" theory; after the outbreak of the current European War, Britain's wartime emergency budget reached 193.3 million pounds, but 99.7 million pounds of which were new tax revenues. Moreover, from the experience of the previous European War, the higher the proportion of tax revenues in wartime finance, the easier it is to reorganize finances after the war, and the budget can be quickly restored to balance after the war. Therefore, wartime tax policies are valued. However, the success of increasing taxes depends on the country's tax system, the people's ability to pay taxes, and the wartime environment. The reason why Britain's wartime tax revenues can reach a satisfactory level is that its peacetime finances have already been based on direct taxes. But this is not the case in our country. Peacetime finances are mainly based on customs, salt, and consolidated taxes. After the successive fall of the coastal provinces, revenues have been drastically reduced. However, in order to make up for this shortfall, and to consider the fairness of the people's burden, we are quite proactive in reforming the tax system. Reforming the tax system can increase wartime tax revenues and lay a good foundation for post-war finances. The wartime tax policy will be discussed in three aspects:

(1) Direct taxes are called good taxes because they meet the three principles of fairness, universality, and elasticity. In the peacetime finances of the United States and the United States, direct taxes are also the mainstay, and they are even more important during and after the war. The financial authorities of our country, in view of this, are working hard to build a direct tax system, so that the future tax revenue center can be placed on direct taxes. Direct taxes are based on income tax, inheritance tax, excessive profits tax in extraordinary times, and stamp tax as the mainstay. Although income tax has not been established for a long time, and the methods of taxation are not yet perfect, and at the current time when the war zone is expanding, the tax revenue has doubled compared to before the war. Inheritance tax has also been officially levied from July 1 this year. As for the excessive profits tax in extraordinary times, it has also been widely promoted, and the results are very good. The stamp tax was also increased from October 11, 1937, increasing the tax rate and expanding the scope of pasting. In terms of the current state of national tax revenues, direct tax revenues have risen from the sixth place before the war to the third place. If the direct tax system can be improved, the increase in future tax revenues will be unlimited, and it will make a great contribution to the reorganization of post-war finances.

(3) Our country's indirect tax system is very unreasonable. The tax rates on luxury goods seem to be still low, and the tax rates on daily necessities are already too high, making the people's burden even more unfair. In order to make up for the revenue shortfall of customs, salt, and consolidated taxes, the government authorities have actively reorganized the indirect tax system to gradually make the tax system more reasonable and the people's burden fairer. And without hindering the people's lives and the national economy, the tax rate will be moderately increased to enrich the national treasury. For example: (1) reorganizing the salt tax; (2) expanding the local goods entrepot tax from October 1, 1937; (3) the consolidated tax is changed to be verified and supplemented by the first-level competent consolidated tax authority upon entry, and promoted to various provinces in the inland; (4) from October 13, 1937, the additional levy of local wine and the implementation of local tobacco tax; (5) modifying the customs tariff rates, reducing the tax rates on imports of necessities, changing the current tax rates to one-third; as for the export of local goods, from June 1, 1938, the current export selection of handicrafts, fishery products, and agricultural products 34 are exempted from export tax to facilitate foreign sales. From the above, the government has both increases and decreases in tax rates. The increased ones are all luxury goods, which can both increase tax revenues and encourage frugality.

(3) In order to show consideration for the people's hardships and protect the people's strength, the financial authorities of our country give appropriate exemptions or rent reductions to those affected by the war in the war zone and near the war zone, in order to lighten the people's burden, so that the areas affected by the war can gradually recover their vitality and cultivate future tax sources.

In short, the purpose of the reorganization of our country's wartime tax system is not only to seek an increase in current income, but to establish a sound tax system, open up reasonable tax sources, make people equally responsible for their ancestors and citizens, and make tax revenues elastic, in order to establish a strong foundation for post-war finance.

### Soviet-German Trade System

— Wu Yugan Answers

(1) What are the differences between the international trade methods of Germany and the United States and Britain?

Germany's foreign trade is now being conducted under the government's vigorous control. The difference between this and the international trade of Britain and the United States is: in essence, only the degree of control is different; in terms of methods, only the scope of control is different. Originally, since the completion of Germany's new economic control plan in 1936, the control of foreign trade was stricter than that of Britain, the United States and other countries. Britain, the United States and other countries often used tariff policies and other items as tools to control trade, while Germany now focuses on the control of imported foreign exchange. Although the operation of imports can be freely conducted by the people, the remittance of import prices must obtain the approval of the control authority in advance, otherwise it is not allowed to be划付劃付划付劃付 paid. The government's reason for controlling imported foreign exchange in this way is naturally the same as the import and export commodity exchange system that was vigorously carried out in the past few years. It is also to restrict unnecessary imports in order to seek a balance in foreign trade income and expenditure. Therefore, Germany believes that this method of control is slightly better than the free trade system of Britain and the United States. As for export trade, Germany has also been controlling export foreign exchange recently. Exporters can certainly transport and sell goods abroad as much as possible, but the foreign exchange obtained must be sold to the government at the exchange rate stipulated by the government. These are all places where Germany's control of foreign trade is stricter than that of Britain and the United States.

### The Knitting Industry in Shanghai

— Si Hua

The History of Knitting

Wool yarn was introduced to China more than 50 years ago. At that time, it was not used much, only for tying hair. Later, Westerners introduced knitting technology to the public to help sell wool yarn, which proved to be very effective. However, the knitting method was ordinary, without any patterns or styles, and there were no specialized knitting talents. The first items hand-knitted with wool yarn were only hats, gloves, shoes, and scarves. The knitting of lined wool vests came later. Because they were light and warm, much better than cotton vests, they were once very popular. In 1933, the Tianjin Ram Brand Wool Yarn Factory held an exhibition in Shanghai, at the China National Products Company, Sincere Company, and Lihua Company, and invited Ms. Liao Fenghua and others to preside over the teaching of wool yarn knitting methods. The public unveiling of the new knitting method started from this.

Knitting Figures

The first to be mentioned should be Ms. Huang Peiying. After graduating from Minli Girls' High School, Ms. Huang went to Japan to study wool yarn knitting. She returned to China in 1928 and invented the table needle machine. In 1929, she was approved by the National Government and obtained a patent. She founded the Peiyang Training Institute and wrote the Peiying Knitting Method. Her works won a special prize at the Puyi Crafts Institute National Products Exhibition. In 1933, she was hired by the Ram Brand Wool Yarn Department of Lihua Company as a knitting professor. Her theoretical and technical skills were both perfect and she can be called a pioneer in the knitting industry. Ms. Bao Guofang is also famous as Ms. Huang. She researched wool yarn knitting very early. In 1933, she was a knitting professor in the Ram Brand Wool Yarn Department of the China National Products Company in Shanghai. In the same year, she went to the China National Products Company in Suzhou to preside over the same position, and again to the China National Products Company in Songjiang to preside over the same position. Later, she broadcasted and taught knitting methods on the China Radio Station. Ms. Bao was the first to teach knitting methods in the air. She wrote a knitting book, which is still selling very well today. The third is Ms. Feng Qiuping. She graduated from Qiude Girls' High School. She was very interested in wool yarn knitting when she was in school. She studied and invented many novel patterns after school. Many classmates often asked her for advice. She has already become a knitting teacher. After leaving school, she has served as a knitting professor in Dasin, Xinxin, Fuan and other companies, and founded the Liangyou Knitting Society. She has many students. There is also Ms. Ni Xiuyue, who currently works at the flagship store of Hengyuanxiang, a wool yarn giant on Xingsheng Street. She earnestly teaches customers the latest knitting methods, and is hired by the Shanghai Wool Yarn Factory to broadcast and teach at the Xinhua Radio Station every morning at 10 o'clock. Ms. Ni is proficient in knitting and has a kind attitude. She is truly a rising star in the knitting industry.

Prospects for Knitting

Knitting cannot be regarded as just one type of needlework. It is actually a new path for many women to engage in production. Considering the current popularity of wool yarn clothing in Shanghai, it will surely spread throughout the country in the future. Although many rural women are familiar with knitting skills, they stick to the old ways and do not know how to improve. They urgently need to be guided. The author hopes that knitting magazines will be printed in the future, knitting vocational schools will be established, and even knitting shops will be like the Su Guang clothing stores, which can be seen everywhere on the streets and alleys.

The Hidden Pain of Weavers

Since the shrinkage of foreign exchange, overseas countries have imported large quantities of wool yarn, using China's extremely low wages to recruit workers to knit, and then transport them to Europe and the United States. The British-owned Hutchison & Co. and Xinji & Co. are engaged in this type of export business. Currently, gloves are the main product. They issue wages of just over 4 jiao per pair, which is reduced by layers of exploitation through large and small contractors. The actual amount workers receive is only just over 2 jiao, while the contractors enrich themselves, with some accumulating assets of hundreds of thousands. I hope that export firms will consider the difficult lives of female workers and seek a remedy, or directly pay the workers, which is what the workers eagerly hope for.

### Umbrella Pine Pattern Knitting

— Bao Guofang

The umbrella pine pattern is very suitable for knitting children's clothing, women's new clothes, and waistcoat, etc. The knitting method is simple, and the pattern is clear and elegant. However, when we learn, we must pay special attention to one point, which is the three methods of decreasing stitches. The methods are as follows:

First method... That is, knit two stitches together.

Second method... First pick out one stitch, knit the next stitch, and cast off the picked out stitch.

Third method... This method is used for knitting two stitches together. First pick out one stitch, knit two stitches together, and cast off the picked out stitch.

Umbrella Pine Pattern Knitting Method

Knit the above four rows repeatedly to form the umbrella pine pattern.

### The National and Public Welfare of Knitting Wool Yarn

— Yao Huifang

At this time of emergency, everything is expensive. People living on isolated islands, regardless of upper, middle, or lower classes, the three items that are necessary for daily life and cannot be separated from are clothing, food, and housing, with clothing being the first. Originally for hygiene and to express one's appearance, from spring to winter, the four seasons alternate, costing a lot of money; the wealthy certainly have no problem, but ordinary classes or families with large populations have a significant expense, especially in the current situation, it feels even more difficult. But to solve this problem, to seek a cheap, high-quality, and durable solution, I felt that the modern popular wool yarn knitting of various costumes can be called a win-win situation, extremely convenient. Wool yarn raw materials are originally made of wool, which is extremely warm and can replace fur. Fur clothing is difficult to modify and expensive, while wool yarn can be disassembled at any time if it is not suitable. After washing, even after three or five years, it is still as good as new. Being able to learn knitting can also save the high cost of tailoring. Small items such as children's clothing, gloves, shoes, socks, scarves, hats, coats, overcoats, etc., can be made as thick or thin as you like, with endless variations. As the art of knitting has not yet become widespread, I want to compete with Europe and the United States to develop the knitting industry in China, so that women have more production skills. Therefore, I am broadcasting oral instructions daily on various radio stations in Shanghai, and have printed a wool yarn knitting manual for guidance. (Sold at Guofang Knitting Society, No. 51, New Market, Jing'an Temple Road, Mullin Road. Those who are interested in knitting can contact or discuss it there and will be welcome.)

Special Announcement: This magazine plans to publish a special issue on women's fashion in the near future and is soliciting contributions openly. Please send contributions to the editorial department of this magazine within five days.

Spring and Autumn

### Sending Off the "Daylight Saving Time Movement"

— Yang Zhicheng

The "Daylight Saving Time Movement" ended on the 12th of this month. The original intention of this movement was to eradicate the bad habit of wasting time among the general public, so as to save material and human resources. Its profound intention is obvious. However, the formation of this habit cannot be simply and broadly attributed to what some people say: "The Chinese are inherently lazy and do not save time." Just look at the vast countryside of China, where people have been inheriting the habit of "working at sunrise and resting at sunset" for thousands of years without slacking off. Even in Shanghai, most people (workers, students, etc.) still grasp their time very regularly and do not waste it. But we cannot deny that there are many people in Shanghai who treat night as day and day as night. This is of course not just a matter of "habit," but rather the result of Shanghai's society. It has produced all kinds of people, and even a group of people who spend their days indulging in pleasure. Thus, gambling dens, dance halls, theaters... this is the inevitable malformation of a capitalist society! The result of the Daylight Saving Time Movement may have changed their living time a little, but the crux of the problem lies in their "lives." The conservation of time and the rectification of life are two inseparable links. A person whose life is full and intense will never waste his time. Conversely, what improvement does the saving of time bring to the life of a lazy and dissolute person? Therefore, when the Daylight Saving Time Movement comes to an end, we hope that everyone will deeply examine their own lives and use every minute of their time for undertakings that are beneficial to improvement. If everyone can save and manage their time, then there is no need to shout loudly about any "Daylight Saving Time Movement."

### Exploiting Trainee Employees for Speculation

— Bai Shunian

The Malicious Policies of a Certain Business

Shanghai's fall into the "isolated island" status has led to the abnormal development of various industries, especially the flourishing of speculative businesses, which is beyond expectation. Beyond the scope of securities, foreign exchange, cotton cloth, food, and daily necessities, there are even speculative capitalists who use the name of recruiting trainee employees to entice unemployed and out-of-school youth. Their brutal and cruel methods are escalating, which is another serious problem in society.

My family originally lived in a remote rural area. Only I was working outside to make a living. After the "August 13th" Incident, the countryside was affected, so we took refuge in Shanghai. My several family members relied on my meager salary to survive, which was very difficult. At that time, my younger brother had just graduated from elementary school. Because we could not afford to continue his education, he responded to a recruitment advertisement for trainee employees from a certain business and went to take the exam. He was actually accepted. I then contacted the business to complete all the procedures. The manager received me and personally gave me the regulations. These included a three-year training period, with the business providing a monthly allowance for pocket money. Within the time limit, if the trainee was expelled by the business for violating regulations, or if he resigned on his own, then all the costs incurred by the business for the trainee's food and lodging during the employment period had to be compensated by the trainee, and a reliable guarantor had to be provided. The details of the trainee's work situation were not explicitly stated. At the time, although I felt that the conditions were too harsh, I had no choice but to accept them silently due to the pressure of making a living. Before my younger brother had been with the business for a month, he complained to me about the hard work and harsh treatment. At the time, I thought it was a common problem for young people to be unable to endure hardship, so I encouraged him to work hard and not give up in the face of difficulties. Now, almost three years have passed. My younger brother returned home the other day and solemnly declared to me: a crisis is imminent. When I asked him the reason, he said that the business manager had, a few days ago, dismissed several other trainee employees on some pretext, and had demanded back compensation fees amounting to more than a thousand yuan. Like rabbits mourning the death of foxes, sympathizing with their own kind, all the colleagues were trembling with fear; because who is without fault, if one is slightly careless, there is always a pretext to be dismissed; the individual not only loses his job, but also has to bear the compensation costs, and their reputation is also affected, causing deep anxiety about the future. I am in an extremely difficult situation, and I can only urge my younger brother to be extra careful.

I secretly think that other people's children abandon their studies to go into business, originally hoping to learn skills for making a living so that they can establish themselves in society. Who would have thought that heartless and sick people would take advantage of this period of severe unemployment. Moreover, the trainee's work is heavy, perhaps twice as much as that of an ordinary employee, but they are not paid a salary. Now they are using this kind of method, which is worse than fraud, on a group of poor, out-of-school youth. How can this not make people gnash their teeth! There is no shortage of people who uphold justice in society, so I have specifically detailed the beginning and end of the matter as an appeal. (Refuses remuneration)

Hawthorne Detective Case

### The Ending of the Dance Queen

— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter Nine: Astonishing News

I nodded and said, "Yes. So, you think this A print was left by Old Mao?"

Hawthorne suddenly stood up, shaking his head as he muttered to himself, "I don't know. I really can't explain it." He put his hands behind his back and began to pace back and forth in the office with his head lowered, showing that he had fallen into deep thought again.

The room was silent for a while, and Hawthorne still didn't say anything. I couldn't bear it any longer and asked,

"Hawthorne, what are you thinking about? According to you, since Lu Jiansheng has been ruled out as a possible perpetrator, and if Yu Gantang's confession is completely credible, he doesn't seem to be the main culprit in the case either. Then, out of the three suspects, only Zhao Boxiong remains. Now, based on Yu Gantang's confirmation—which naturally requires us to completely believe his words as a prerequisite—Zhao Boxiong's suspicion should be further deepened. We only need to force him to confess the truth, and naturally everything will be revealed. Why are you so hesitant? Hawthorne, what exactly are you thinking? Why don't you tell me?"

Hawthorne's pace still didn't stop, and he answered distractedly, "I'm thinking about Zhao Boxiong's sneer, and I'm also thinking—"

A burst of rapid telephone ringing interrupted his words. Hawthorne suddenly stopped, hesitated slightly, and hurried to the telephone. I also followed him, as if I had a kind of instinctive intuition that this time the phone call would bring some startling news. After Hawthorne picked up the receiver, I knew that the other party was Ni Jinshou. Ni Jinshou's voice was particularly loud, and I could hear every word clearly as I stood next to him. The news was indeed startling.

Ni Jinshou said, "Mr. Hawthorne, things have gone sour—completely sour! Zhao Boxiong has left!"

Hawthorne's hand holding the receiver also trembled, and he asked with wide eyes, "Left? But did he escape?"

"No, Director Cui let him go. I had dinner at home and rushed to the bureau, preparing to question Zhao Boxiong. It is said that he first wrote a note to the director, and then asked to make a phone call. After a while, the director called him in for a meeting, talked for a while, and let him go on the spot. Don't you think this is embarrassing?"

"Strange!" Hawthorne couldn't say anything else besides these two words. He was stunned. I also thought that this news was too unexpected. For a moment, not only could I not think of a response, but I also couldn't figure out what reason Director Cui had for abusing his power and letting go of such an important suspect so easily. Unexpectedly, even more startling news continued to come from the phone. (135)

### Starting from "Overcrowded Prisons"

— Shi Wei

The newspapers on the 10th of this month carried a piece of news worth paying attention to, that is, the Jiangsu-Shanghai Second Special District Prison on Route Massenet in the French Concession. Because the prison cells are not large, the capacity of prisoners is stipulated not to exceed 1,600 people; "However, since the "August 13th" Shanghai Battle occurred, and the cost of living has risen day by day, the number of criminals has also increased day by day." It is said that at most, there were more than 2,500 people. Because the authorities had economic difficulties, they had allowed bail for those sentenced to less than five years of imprisonment and non-recidivists in February of this year. By the 9th of this month, four such rounds had been held.

To become a criminal because the cost of living is "high" can be said to be "the norm since ancient times, and even more so today." The fact is very clear: if a person is not born into the world, then so be it. Once born, a person always wants to live on; and when drinking cement and eating cold rice cannot sustain breathing, then one must embrace the "principle of survival" of "rather commit a crime than starve to death" and take a risk. If one is lucky enough to escape the law, then one can still survive for a few days; even if one is unfortunately caught, one can still "sit and eat prison food."

Writing this, I am reminded of a story: a few years ago, right here in Shanghai, a young man who had been unemployed for a long time went to throw himself into the Huangpu River because he had no means of living; as a result, he was rescued by the Life Saving Society. The person in charge of the Life Saving Society said to him, "You are young, you must think positively about everything." But the young man replied, "I have no food to eat, can you save me?" The person in charge said that this was not within their jurisdiction, so the next day, a corpse floated up on the Huangpu River.

Now, among these hundreds of criminals who have been released on bail, whether some will "return to the forbidden land" remains to be proven by facts; but considering the prevalence of robbery and fraud, there are certainly many "followers." Therefore, stabilizing the lives of citizens and punishing those who disturb the lives of citizens—especially the "rice weevils"—should be an urgent task that cannot be delayed.
